            Madagascar's president has fled the African nation, the head of the opposition and other officials said on Monday, the second time that young protesters have toppled a government in weeks of worldwide Gen Z unrest.
    


            Siteny Randrianasoloniaiko, leader of the opposition in parliament, told Reuters that President Andry Rajoelina left Madagascar on Sunday after units of the army defected and joined the protesters.
    


            “We called the staff of the presidency, and they confirmed that he left the country,” Randrianasoloniaiko said, adding that Rajoelina's current whereabouts were unknown.
    


            The president's office, which had earlier said Rajoelina would address the nation at 7 p.m. local time on Monday, did not reply to requests for comment.
    


            A military source told Reuters that Rajoelina flew out of the country on a French military aircraft on Sunday. French radio RFI said he had struck a deal with President Emmanuel Macron.
    


            The source said that a French Army Casa aircraft landed in Madagascar's Sainte Marie airport on Sunday. “Five minutes later, a helicopter arrived and transferred its passenger into the Casa,” the source said, adding that Rajoelina was the passenger.
    


            Demonstrations had erupted in the former French colony on September 25 over water and power shortages but quickly escalated into an uprising over broader grievances, including corruption, bad governance and lack of basic services.
    


            The anger mirrors recent protests against ruling elites in countries including Nepal, where the prime minister was forced to resign last month, and Morocco.
    


            Rajoelina had appeared increasingly isolated after losing the support of CAPSAT, an elite unit which had helped him seize power in a 2009 coup.
    


            CAPSAT joined the protesters over the weekend, saying it refused to fire on them and escorting thousands of demonstrators in the main square of the capital Antananarivo.
    


            It then said it was taking charge of the military and appointed a new army chief, prompting Rajoelina to warn on Sunday of an attempt to seize power in the island nation off the coast of southern Africa.
    


            On Monday, a faction of the paramilitary gendarmerie supporting the protests also took control of the gendarmerie at a formal ceremony in the presence of senior government officials, a Reuters witness said.
    


            The president of the Senate – a focus of public anger during the protests – was relieved of his functions, the Senate said in a statement, and Jean André Ndremanjary was appointed on a temporary basis.
    


            In the absence of a president, the leader of the Senate takes the post until elections are held.
    


            On Monday, thousands of people gathered in a square in the capital, shouting “the president must quit now”.
    


            Hotel worker Adrianarivony Fanomegantsoa, 22, told Reuters his 300,000-ariary ($67) monthly salary was barely enough to cover food, explaining his reasons for joining the protests.
    


            “In 16 years the president and his government have done nothing except enrich themselves while the people stay poor. And the youth, the Gen Z, suffer the most,” he said.
    


            At least 22 people have been killed in clashes between protesters and the security forces since September 25, according to the UN.
    


            Madagascar, where the median age is younger than 20, has a population of about 30 million – three-quarters of whom live in poverty, with GDP per capita plunging 45% between independence in 1960 and 2020, according to the World Bank.
    


            While the country is best known for producing most of the world's vanilla, other exports including nickel, cobalt, textiles and shrimp are also vital to foreign earnings and employment.

""The forces of chaos that have plagued the region are totally defeated,"" Trump said in a speech before Israel's parliament.

He added that ""this is not only the end of a war,"" but ""the end of an age of terror and death"" in the Middle East.

As part of the deal, Israel freed dozens of Palestinian prisoners and detainees, who returned to the Gaza Strip and the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Polish broadcaster TVP Info reported.

“The skies are calm, the guns are silent, the sirens are still, and the sun rises on a Holy Land that is finally at peace,” Trump said ahead of a planned summit in Egypt aimed at consolidating the ceasefire.

He added, as quoted by Reuters: “Now it is time to translate these victories against terrorists on the battlefield into the ultimate prize of peace and prosperity for the entire Middle East.”

The release of hostages and Palestinian detainees marked the first phase of the Gaza accord reached last week in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.

More than 20 world leaders were expected to attend Monday's summit to discuss next steps under Trump's 20-point peace blueprint, according to Reuters.

The war began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas militants carried out a cross-border attack that killed about 1,200 people in Israel and took 251 hostages.

Israeli airstrikes, bombardments and ground offensives that followed killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, and devastated much of the enclave, where aid restrictions had fueled famine.

Poland in late September welcomed Trump's 20-point peace plan for the Gaza Strip, calling it a realistic attempt to end the conflict between Israel and Hamas and create conditions for lasting peace in the Middle East.

Besides the ceasefire and hostage exchange, the plan calls for a phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, Hamas disarmament and a transitional administration led by an international body, according to reports.

""We welcome with hope the United States' peace plan for the Gaza Strip, developed in consultation with Arab and Muslim countries and the Israeli government,"" Poland's foreign ministry said in a statement on September 30.

It described the proposal as ""a realistic and bold attempt"" to end the two-year-old conflict and said the plan ""paves the way for economic recovery and a two-state solution,"" with Gaza and the West Bank integrated into a future Palestinian state.

West Jerusalem has accused Hamas of a “blatant breach” of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, as only four of the 28 bodies of the deceased Israelis are set to be returned today.

Defense Minister Israel Katz issued a stark warning to the Palestinian militant group, saying that “any delay or deliberate avoidance will be considered a gross violation of the agreement and will be responded to accordingly.”

The IDF has said the Red Cross has notified the military that it has collected two caskets holding the apparent bodies of slain hostages from Hamas in southern Gaza a short while ago.

The Red Cross is now bringing the caskets to IDF troops inside the enclave, where a small ceremony, led by a military rabbi, will be held. The remains will then be taken for identification.

All of the remaining living hostages in Gaza have been freed from Hamas captivity and are back in Israel after two years of war, but the remains of 28 deceased captives are expected to be returned in separate batches. 

Meanwhile, some of the vans carrying Palestinian prisoners who have been released from Israeli prisons arrived a short while ago in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. Under an agreement brokered by Trump, Israel is releasing about 250 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences and more than 1,700 who were detained since the beginning of the Gaza war in 2023, including all women and minors.

Israel will also allow humanitarian aid into the enclave to ease severe food shortages.

The 20-point ceasefire plan unveiled by Trump in late September also calls for a phased full Israeli pullout from Gaza, disarming of Hamas, and the creation of a transitional international administration. It envisions Gaza as a “deradicalized terror-free zone” with Hamas barred from governance.

The war between Israel and Hamas began October 7, 2023, when Hamas militants attacked Israel, killing about 1,200 people and seizing around 250 hostages. Israel's operation in response has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and triggered a humanitarian crisis in the enclave, prompting the UN to accuse West Jerusalem of genocide.

Global leaders welcomed Trump's plan and called for rapid implementation, urging both sides to comply with the humanitarian provisions.

13 October 2025

Trump has hailed a newly signed agreement between Israel and Hamas as a historic breakthrough, announcing the return of hostages and ongoing efforts to recover the remains of others.

“With the historic agreement we've just signed, those prayers of millions have finally been answered. As you know, the hostages have been returned and further work goes on having to do with the, sadly to say, bodies.”

Trump has individually greeted roughly 35 foreign leaders who have arrived in Sharm el-Sheikh for a conference on Gaza.

One by one, each leader, standing above large letters that read, “Peace 2025,” approaches Trump, shakes his hand, and exchanges a few brief remarks while posing for a photo before being whisked out of the room.



The leaders include Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, in what is his first meeting and conversation with Trump since the latter's return to the Oval Office.

Netanyahu refused to attend at the last minute, citing the Simhat Torah holiday, which begins tonight.

Trump has arrived in the Egyptian resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh for a deal-signing ceremony that is being attended by a number of other world leaders.

Air Force One was escorted into the area by Egyptian fighter jets.

Sharm el-Sheikh is where representatives from Israel, Hamas, and the United States met last week to finalize the Gaza ceasefire deal.

Netanyahu hopes sending more humanitarian aid to Gaza will lessen the international criticism of Israel for causing starvation in the enclave and make the international organizations dealing with aid irrelevant, Dr. Alon Liel has told RT.

The Red Cross is en route to receive the bodies of four Israeli hostages in southern Gaza, the IDF has said.

The Red Cross will later bring the caskets to IDF troops inside Gaza, where a small ceremony, led by a military rabbi, will be held in their memory. The caskets will also be examined by sappers “for security purposes,” according to the military.

The Al-Qassam Brigades has said it will hand over the bodies of four captives today. It identified the deceased captives as Guy Ilouz, Yossi Sharabi, Bipin Joshi, and Daniel Perez.

Hamas released all 20 remaining living hostages held in Gaza earlier, but it is still holding the remains of a number of dead Israeli captives.

Trump is now departing Ben Gurion Airport and heading to Egypt for a global leaders summit on Gaza.

The Palestinian prisoners being released are likely to be in “horrific” condition because Palestinians in Israeli jails are subjected to the most “brutal and violent torture,” Al Jazeera has claimed, citing academic Basil Farraj.

”We know that since October 7 [2023], while torture and violence will have been systematically practiced inside Israeli prisons, these prisoners have been subjected to a brutal campaign,” Farraj said.

”They have been brutally beaten, tortured, and violated. We've witnessed and heard stories of sexual violence.”

Farraj says the conditions of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails will continue and the release of the detainees “does not mean the end of the struggle” of others who remain in Israeli prisons.

Trump has concluded his 65-minute-long speech to Israel's parliament, saying that “we're going to build a legacy that all the people of this region can be proud of.”

“So now we're going to forge a future that is worthy of our heritage. We're going to build a legacy that all the people of this region can be proud of,” he added.

Iran would've had nuclear weapons in two months or less if its facilities hadn't been struck, Trump has claimed, and the Middle Eastern countries that back the Gaza ceasefire deal wouldn't have done so in the face of a nuclear Iran. “We took a big cloud off the Middle East, and off of Israel,” Trump added.

”This was our last shot,” he says. “And it was an honor to help.”

NATO kicked off its annual nuclear exercise in the Netherlands on Monday. The bloc's secretary general, Mark Rutte, says the drills are necessary to send a “clear signal to any potential adversary.” 

The two-week Steadfast Noon exercise comes amid what Moscow has described as rampant anti-Russian hysteria among the Western European nations, accusing NATO of militarizing the continent and preparing for a direct confrontation.

Announcing the drills on Friday, Rutte said they help ensure that NATO's nuclear deterrent remains “as effective as possible.” 

This year's Steadfast Noon is being hosted by the Netherlands, with Volkel Air Base serving as the main operating site. Supporting elements will be stationed at bases in Belgium, the UK, and Denmark.

According to NATO, the exercise will involve around 70 aircraft from 14 member states, including both conventional and dual-capable aircraft. About 2,000 personnel are taking part, supported by surveillance, air-to-air refueling, and command-and-control aircraft. NATO has emphasized that no nuclear weapons will be used during the exercise.

Moscow has yet to comment on the current drills, but has previously condemned past Steadfast Noon exercises, saying they “lead to nothing but ratcheting up tensions” which are already high due to the Ukraine conflict.

Russian officials have accused Western European nations of uniting in what Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov has called a collective “anti-Russian frenzy.” Ushakov said the region has been speaking in an “extremely belligerent, extremely negative” voice against Moscow while spreading “brazen lies” about it.

Earlier this month, President Vladimir Putin said Western Europe has been “whipping up hysteria” about an alleged threat of war with Russia, calling such concerns a “nonsense mantra” and urging leaders in the region to focus on domestic issues instead.

Putin has also advocated for extending nuclear arms controls, calling on the US to agree to prolong the 2010 New START treaty for another year and refrain from taking steps that could break the current balance.

The US could attempt to assassinate Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro after declaring him a drug lord and a terrorist, Politico has reported, citing informed sources.

Over the past several weeks, Washington has conducted strikes off the Venezuelan coast against what it called “drug boats,” killing more than two-dozen people and expanding its military presence in the region. US officials have accused Maduro of having links to narcotics networks – a claim he has rejected. Caracas has accused Washington of trying to topple Maduro's government, which US officials have denied.

Despite not speaking publicly about regime change in the oil-rich Latin American nation, US President Donald Trump does want to force the Venezuelan leader out of power and plans to use his war on drug cartels as a pretext to do so, Politico claimed in an article on Sunday.

“Would everyone like Maduro to go? Yes,” an unnamed official from the Trump administration told the outlet.

Trump has “many plans” available to him when it comes to acting against Venezuela, including carrying out strikes on alleged cartel-related targets inside the country, the official said. However, the US president has not yet given an order to target Maduro directly, he stressed.

According to another person familiar with the discussions, that could well change if the Venezuelan leader is branded a drug lord and a terrorist by Washington. “Don't we go after indicted narco traffickers and terrorists all the time?” the source said.

The Trump administration official suggested that the US may not have to resort to such drastic measures to remove Maduro, saying that “we are going to put a tremendous amount of pressure on him. He is weak. It is quite possible that he will fall from this pressure alone without us having to do anything.”

The New York Times reported on Friday that Venezuela had offered the US sweeping economic concessions, including a potential agreement to allow American companies to take a major stake in its oil sector, during months of secret talks aimed at defusing tensions. However, according to another report by the paper, Trump ordered that dialogue with Caracas be broken off after he had “grown frustrated” over Maduro's unwillingness to relinquish power voluntarily.

MOSCOW, October 13. /TASS/. Launching Tomahawk missiles would require the involvement of US personnel, so the potential delivery of such missiles to Kiev could have serious consequences, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

Earlier, Medvedev wrote on Russia's Max national messenger that the potential shipment of Tomahawk missiles to Kiev would do no good to anyone.

MOSCOW, October 13. /TASS/. Moscow expects that all the agreements on the Gaza Strip reached at a summit in Sharm el-Sheikh will be implemented while US President Donald Trump and regional leaders ensure an immediate ceasefire, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at a meeting with journalists from Arab countries.

""We sincerely wish success for today's event, the top-level meeting in Sharm el-Sheikh attended, as I understand, by over 20 countries, both from the Arab world and several Western states,"" the top Russian diplomat said. ""I hope that all agreements will be fulfilled, even though we hear statements both from Hamas and from Tel Aviv that nothing is over yet and the crisis may resume,"" he added.

""I believe that it is very important that those who initiated this forum, above all, President Trump, with support from the Egyptian president, the leadership of Qatar and Turkey, prevent such a development and focus primarily on the necessity of an immediate ceasefire and the observance of the policy course that was agreed on for the withdrawal of Israeli troops in the Gaza Strip, the adjustment of humanitarian aid and, certainly, the restoration of this significant place on Earth which probably suffered more than other territories across the globe over post-war years,"" the Russian foreign minister noted.

Lavrov emphasized that ""the long-term settlement of this situation is possible only if UN decisions on creating a Palestinian state are fulfilled.""

A peace summit in Sharm el-Sheikh is convened following an official conclusion of a ceasefire deal in the Gaza Strip. That said, representatives from the Gaza-based Palestinian movement Hamas and Israel who held talks on ending hostilities in the embattled enclave and on swapping the hostages held there for Palestinian prisoners, refused to participate in the meeting.

According to Egypt's information portal As-Shorouq, the summit will be attended by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Earlier, the US Axios portal reported that the upcoming summit will bring together the leaders or top diplomats from the UK, Germany, Indonesia, Jordan, Italy, Qatar, the UAE, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and France.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Areas from the Carolinas to New England see flooding and high winds, while flooding in Alaska carries away homes

New Jersey and parts of New York City were under a state of emergency on Monday as slow-moving nor'easter moved up the easter US seaboard, while in western Alaska remnants of Typhoon Halong lashed coastal hamlets and ripped houses off their foundations.

In Alaska, rescue aircraft were sent to the villages of Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, where there were reports of up to 20 people possibly unaccounted for.

“We have received reports that people's homes have floated away and that people were potentially in those homes,” Zidek, a spokesperson for the state division of homeland security and emergency management, told the Associated Press.

The area is among one of the most isolated in the US, where some communities have few roads and residents use boardwalks, boats and snowmobiles to get around, Zidek said.

The Alaska governor, Mike Dunleavy, extended a disaster declaration to communities in the Yupitt, Pribilof Island and Lower Kuskokwim education districts.

“Every effort will be made to help those hit by this storm. Help is on the way,” Dunleavy said in a statement on X.

Separately, the storm making its way up the east coast prompted flooding and high winds in coastal areas from the Carolinas to New England. 
 In Delaware, emergency management officials activated the state national guard in response to rising floodwaters and harsh winds. In North Carolina's Outer Banks, seawater washed over highway 12 at a motel near Buxton.

Flooding was reported as widespread in Georgetown county in South Carolina, where several motorists had to be rescued when rising water; in Charleston, many downtown streets were closed because of rising waters; and in Myrtle Beach, heavy rain overwhelmed that city's stormwater system.
 “Please be safe and stay home, if possible,” Myrtle Beach officials posted on Facebook.

As the storm moved up to the coast, all of New Jersey was placed under a state of emergency. The New York governor, Kathy Hochul, issued a similar declaration for eight southern counties, urging people to monitor forecasts and avoid travel.

The National Weather Service placed New York City, Long Island and southern Westchester county under a coastal flood warning and wind advisory through at least Monday afternoon. 
  The emergency declaration, which included the five boroughs of New York City and Westchester county, forced the cancellation of the annual Columbus Day parade in Manhattan, news outlets reported.

Among the areas hardest hit were coastal areas of suburban Long Island, where up to 3in of rain and winds packing peak gusts of 45 to 50 mph inland away from the shore, and 55 to 60 mph on the coast.

“The highest tides and worst of the coastal flooding along the Jersey Shore are expected Monday afternoon. Gusty winds from the north-east can push in tremendous amounts of water into bays and inlets,” AccuWeather hurricane expert Alex DaSilva said.

“This storm may create some of the highest tides that the north-east has seen in more than a decade. Some beaches may be completely underwater as this storm passes off the coast,” he added. “This storm may not have a name, but it is causing some serious problems and disruptions along the coast.”

Police in Nassau and Suffolk counties said they had received calls about downed tree limbs but no reports of injuries or any significant road closures. Freeport Mayor Robert Kennedy said the village received nuisance flooding and experienced extra high tides.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Cause of explosion at Accurate Energetic Systems that leveled building is unknown but foul play not ruled out

At least 200 mourners came to the Humphreys county courthouse at twilight on Sunday to mourn the 16 people killed in an explosion at a nearby munitions plant in middle Tennessee early on Friday.

Humphreys county sheriff Chris Davis said that even in these nightmarish days, “the true strength of our county is our people”.

“When tragedy hits, our people always come out,” he said through tears.

He urged the local community to show up for their neighbors who lost friends and family members in the explosion that leveled a building at the Accurate Energetic Systems (AES) headquarters in nearby Bucksnort, Tennessee and flung debris two miles away. “Help fill the void of that lost loved one with your love,” he said. “Let's take time to wrap our arms around these families.”

Attendees passed a flame among white candlesticks until the courthouse lawn was filled with soft light. Musicians played Christian worship songs and classic hymns, and community members sang along softly.

The Tennessee governor, Bill Lee, visited with families and flew over the site to survey the damage. “It's kind of what Tennesseans do: they surround themselves in the times of greatest challenge,” Lee said. “The losses are staggering.”

The cause of the explosion has not been identified, and authorities have not ruled out foul play. Authorities have not released the names of the victims, but they have spoken with the families of all 16 workers who are assumed deceased, and they have confirmed that the operation has shifted from rescue to recovery. Teams at the site are using rapid DNA technology in an effort to identify the remains of the dead.

In a press conference Friday afternoon, a reporter asked Davis to describe the site. “Can I describe the building? There's nothing to describe, it's gone,” he said. “It's the most devastating scene that I've seen in my career.”

Some churches in the area cancelled their usual assemblies this morning, opting instead for intimate prayer services to lift up the victims and their families. One small church was full to standing room only. White folding chairs were brought out from the back to accommodate the overflow of guests.

Chairs ringed the assistant preacher, full of red-eyed congregants. He stood before a simple altar that held a cross and two lit candlesticks. He didn't use a microphone; he didn't need one. The sanctuary was silent, except for the sounds of sniffles and the occasional broken sob. People passed around boxes of tissues and fussy babies, and held onto one another. A few people in blue shirts from Billy Graham Ministries were on hand for any mourners who wanted to talk or pray after the service.

After the service, a man who knew one of the deceased said he had never been to the church before, but he thought it was usually a very small congregation.
 On Sunday morning, an estimated 150 to 200 people were in attendance.

As congregants began to wander outside, volunteers folded the white chairs back up and carried them into the back room. Two women, weeping, hugged. “We'll see him again someday,” one told the other.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Veterans are facing federal charges after protesting Ice sweeps and Trump's national guard deployments. The justice department claims the veterans were violent

US military veterans increasingly face arrest and injury amid protests over Donald Trump's deportation campaign and his push to deploy national guard members to an ever-widening number of American cities.

The Guardian has identified eight instances where military veterans have been prosecuted or sought damages after being detained by federal agents.

The latest incident occurred in Broadview, outside Chicago, where 70-year old air force veteran Dana Briggs was charged with felony assault on a federal officer on 29 September.

A widely shared video on social media shows a masked US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agent advance on and knock over the elderly veteran during a protest outside an Ice detention center.

Federal prosecutors claim Briggs committed assault when he “made physical contact with an agent's arm while the agent attempted to extend the safety perimeter”.

Briggs pleaded not guilty and was released on an appearance bond.

Jose Vasquez, a former US army staff sergeant and executive director of the progressive veterans' organization Common Defense, which counts Briggs as a member, said veterans like Briggs “have stood up at Ice protests and faced arrest because we recognize a pattern of state-sanctioned abuse”.

Another veteran, John Cerrone, was arrested while protesting outside the Broadview Ice detention the day before Briggs. A social media video shows a group of masked agents tackle the 35-year-old marine corps veteran, who served as a combat infantryman in Afghanistan, as teargas floats in the air.

Cerrone says he was held for nine hours at the Broadview facility, alone in a cell with walls covered by blood, hair and mucus. He says that while he was behind bars he was visited by an Ice agent who boasted that he had shot Cerrone in the head with rubber bullets and exclaimed: “Where is that pussy!”

“Their conduct was completely unprofessional in my experience in combat infantry,” Cerrone said. “Even in Afghanistan, we had very clear rules of engagement. The conduct of these agents was such that if it occurred in Afghanistan, they would be removed from the front line. They would be court-martialed.”

Cerrone was released after receiving a citation for “exhibiting disorderly conduct on federal property”, a misdemeanor under federal law, which he plans to contest.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told the Guardian: “Anyone who assaults or otherwise harms law enforcement officers will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.” Jackson added that “Ice officers are facing an 1,000% increase in assaults because of unhinged rhetoric from activists and Democrat politicians smearing heroic Ice officers.”

Jackson and a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson did not provide data to back up the claim about a 1,000% increase.

In a brief reply to questions from the Guardian, a Department of Justice spokesperson said: “Under this Administration, we follow the law and have a one-tier system of justice, and this Department of Justice will relentlessly uphold the rule of law to protect our nation.”

“What drives so many veterans into action is not only the injustice faced by immigrants and protesters, but also the larger threat to democracy rooted in government brutality and militarization,” Vasquez, the Common Defense leader, said. “The disturbing escalation in arrests and violence signals that the basic freedoms we once swore to protect are under attack.”

Not all of the veterans discussed in this story indicated their military service at the time of the incidents or their arrests.

On Thursday, the US district judge Sara Ellis issued a temporary restraining order restricting federal agents from “using riot control weapons” against journalists, protesters and religious practitioners in Chicago unless there is probable cause that the individuals have committed a crime.

In a statement in the wake of Briggs's arrest, Demi Palecek – an Illinois army national guard member who is running as a Democrat for a state legislative seat in Chicago – criticized Ice agents for their lack of training.

“As a military member, I can tell you – the way they handle weapons is reckless and dangerous,” she said. “I've seen Ice agents with their fingers on the trigger of real M16s, pointing M9s directly at people. Trigger-happy. No trigger discipline… with this level of escalation and incompetence, people will die.”

An DHS spokesperson countered that “Ice and other federal law enforcement are using proper force with professional training to protect the public as well as federal buildings from violent Antifa-aligned terrorists.” Those arrested assaulted Ice officers, the spokesperson said.

Veterans have also protested Ice's use of a Chicago area VA hospital's parking lot as a staging ground for immigration raids.

Senator Tammy Duckworth – a former US army helicopter pilot who lost the use of both legs when she was shot down over Iraq – offered her support to demonstrators on 17 September, demanding that secretary of veterans affairs, Doug Collins, evict agents from the Edward Hines Jr VA Hospital.

“It adds injury to insult when VA surrenders resources in support of reckless, paramilitary activities that do nothing to enhance Veteran care – and even worse, are actively harming Veterans and US servicemembers by rounding up these patriotic Americans, along with their family members, and deporting them with little or no due process out of the country they were willing to risk their lives to defend,” she wrote.

“We have veterans who are staying away and not getting healthcare or coming in carrying their passports,” said Aaron Hughes, an Iraq war veteran and former Illinois national guardsman, who is a member of the anti-war veterans group, About Face, which organized the protest.

Nicholas Podjasek, a 34 year-old US air force veteran born in Honduras, told the Guardian he cancelled a primary care appointment at the Hines VA which had been scheduled for Thursday.

Though Podjasek, like nearly all veterans is a US citizen, he said many are nonetheless worried about being detained by Ice “because we are brown”, citing a Trump administration policy that legalized racial profiling in immigration enforcement.

“These people are masking themselves and they zip tie children,” he said. “They've broken into people's homes and apartments. They could easily detain me on public transportation on the way to the VA or right outside the gate.”

In an email to the Guardian, VA press secretary Peter Kasperowicz denied such fear exists. Kasperowicz said the VA was “proud to support its federal partners in the fight against illegal immigration” and that there “has been no impact on veteran care or facility access” from Ice agents' use of the Hines VA parking lot.

In Portland, Oregon, US marine corps veteran Daryn Herzberg II, who served in Afghanistan, is seeking $150,000 in damages after he was hospitalized after being tackled from behind by Ice agents while protesting outside a federal facility in Portland on 13 August.

A video posted on social media shows an agent grabbing Herzberg by the hair and slamming his face into the ground multiple times while saying, “You're not talking shit anymore are you?” according to a Federal Tort Claims Act complaint filed by his attorney.

A DHS spokesperson countered that the former marine corps sergeant, who was honorably discharged in 2012, “is well known for acts of violence outside the Ice facility in Portland, including throwing rocks and other objects at the building and personnel.” The spokesperson also said Herzberg has “used fake blood to falsify injuries” and “perpetuated and encouraged violence” against Ice.

Herzberg has not been charged with a crime. His attorney, Michael Fuller, denied the spokesperson's assertions and said “the Ice assault video speaks for itself.”

“The fact that DHS won't attribute its slander of a US marine to an actual witness speaks to the baseless nature of its allegations,” the attorney said.

As previously reported by the Guardian, Afghanistan war veteran Bajun Mavalwalla II faces federal conspiracy charges after participating in a 11 June protest that sought to block the transport of two Venezuelan migrants who were in the country legally seeking asylum when they were detained by Ice.

In Washington DC, attorney general Pam Bondi announced on 14 August that she was charging Afghanistan war veteran Sean Charles Dunn with felony assault after he allegedly threw a sandwich at a Customs and Border Patrol agent. However, prosecutors were unable to secure an indictment from a grand jury.

Other notable veterans arrested, include:

Iraq war veteran and US citizen George Retes, 25, was arrested on 10 July by Ice during a raid on a cannabis farm in Ventura county, California where he worked as a security guard. He was held in federal custody for three days.

Retes is seeking damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act, alleging wrongful arrest. In an op-ed in the San Francisco Chronicle, he wrote: “If it can happen to me, it can happen to any one of us.” In a social media post on X, the Department of Homeland Security alleged he was arrested for assault. As of this writing, no charges have been filed.

A DHS spokesperson told the Guardian that the justice department was reviewing the case, “along with dozens of others, for potential charges related to the execution of the federal search warrant in Camarillo”.

On 25 August, 20-year army combat veteran Jay Carey – who served in Iraq, Bosnia and Afghanistan – was arrested and faces two federal misdemeanor charges after burning a flag in front of the White House. Carey, from western North Carolina, was part of a small group of veterans who came to Washington to protest the national guard's deployment to that city.

On 13 June , an 87-year-old disabled veteran in a walker was arrested after he traveled from an assisted living facility in Florida to protest Donald Trump's military parade. John Spitzberg, whose service spanned the army, air force and air national guard, was among dozens of veterans arrested for protesting what they said was the politicization of the armed forces and Trump's authoritarian instincts. Spitzberg is a member of Veterans for Peace.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

A surname is written after the first name, which is also referred to as a given name or, traditionally, a Christian name. A closer look at the history of surnames reveals some fascinating insights into their origins.

On April 2, Trump announced his “reciprocal tariff” strategy, aimed at punishing trading partners who sell more to the US than they buy in return. Central to his policy is the disputed view that such trade deficits harm the US economy. While Trump later suspended most of the tariffs to allow time for negotiations, some still went into effect, and the others remain a looming economic threat.

Editorial 

16:40 JST, October 13, 2025

It has been only about a month since the supreme leaders of China, Russia and North Korea gathered in Beijing in September. This time, the three countries in Pyongyang once again demonstrated their solidarity.

The collusion between North Korea, China and Russia that ignores international law and attempts to rewrite the order cannot be overlooked.

North Korea held a large-scale military parade in Pyongyang on Friday to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Workers' Party of Korea. Alongside Kim Jong Un, the party's general secretary, Chinese Premier Li Qiang and former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev were among those who watched the parade.

North Korea continues to ignore U.N. Security Council sanctions resolutions and strengthen its nuclear and missile capabilities. The bizarre aspect is that the key figures from China and Russia — permanent members of the Security Council who should bear responsibility for world peace and stability — have observed this very development.

It has been pointed out that North Korea possesses about 2 tons of highly enriched uranium that could be used in nuclear weapons and is capable of producing 100 nuclear warheads. China and Russia once opposed North Korea for possessing nuclear weapons, but some observers believe they have shifted to not pursuing Pyongyang's denuclearization.

North Korea's nuclear development poses a serious threat to the international community and must never be tolerated.

The collusion of the three countries has repercussions extending beyond East Asia. Russia invaded Ukraine, and North Korea has also joined in by dispatching troops there. By importing energy from Russia, China supports its wartime economy, thereby delaying the end of the war in Ukraine.

The latest military parade unveiled a new Hwasong-20 intercontinental ballistic missile, which is believed to have the capability to strike anywhere in the United States. Advanced weapons such as drone-launching vehicles and hypersonic missiles, which are considered difficult to intercept, also made appearances.

“Our army should continue to grow into an invincible entity that destroys all threats approaching our range of self-defense,” Kim said in his speech. Japan, the United States and South Korea must unite and intensify pressure to deter North Korea.

A concerning aspect is that U.S. President Donald Trump is seeking to break the deadlock through a summit with Kim, as he did during his first term.

If Trump makes concessions to Pyongyang, such as allowing possession of nuclear weapons and medium- and short-range ballistic missiles in exchange for scrapping ICBMs capable of reaching the U.S. mainland, it could jeopardize regional security.

At the Japan-South Korea summit held at the end of September, the two countries confirmed their continued cooperation toward the complete denuclearization of North Korea. Japan and South Korea, both U.S. allies, must persistently urge Trump not to rush into a hasty deal with Pyongyang.

Editor's note: The story has been updated with additional details.

Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, arrived in Kyiv on Oct. 13 for discussions with Ukrainian officials on Europe's financial and military support for the war-torn country.

The talks will also concern Ukraine's energy sector and ""holding Russia accountable for its war crimes,"" Kallas said on X.

The visit comes as Russia has escalated attacks against Ukraine's energy grid as winter draws near. A combined missile and drone strike on Oct. 10 caused widespread outages in Kyiv and across Ukrainian regions.

Later in the day, Kallas announced that the EU has pledged an initial 10 million euros ($11.5 million) to set up a special tribunal to prosecute Russia's aggression against Ukraine, alongside another 6 million euros ($7 million) to support Ukrainian children deported by Russia and victims of sexual violence.

""The EU has already mobilized 800 million euros ($930 million) to support Ukraine this winter,"" Kallas said at a joint press conference with Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha.

 ""We are working on an extra 100 million euros ($120 million) for generators, shelters, and cold-weather gear.""

Sybiha, in turn, highlighted European military support for Ukraine under the NATO-led Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) program, which allows allies to purchase U.S. arms for Kyiv.

Six countries have already allocated funds to PURL, and seven more nations have signaled intent to participate, Ukraine's chief diplomat said during the briefing.

NATO allies have allocated over $2 billion for Ukraine under the initiative in September, with the first shipments approved by the Trump administration reportedly including Patriot and HIMARS missiles.

Germany, the Netherlands, Canada, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden have already allocated funds to PURL. 

Other allies, including Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Luxembourg, Belgium, Iceland, and Slovenia, also voiced readiness to participate.

""This year, the European Union is providing record levels of military support. EU sanctions have already deprived Russia of hundreds of billions of euros to fund its war,"" Kallas said, pledging further measures.

""Maybe time was once on Russia's side, but it's shifting to Ukraine now.""

As Russia ramps up its attacks, Kyiv has called upon its Western partners to strengthen Ukrainian air defenses and use immobilized assets to aid Ukraine.

European leaders have been discussing the use of frozen Russian central bank assets to fund a so-called reparations loan, which could provide Kyiv with at least 140 billion euros ($160 billion), to be repaid only once Moscow agrees to pay war reparations.

Recent months also saw tensions rise between Moscow and Europe due to Russian drones and aircraft repeatedly violating NATO airspace. Further suspicious drone sightings caused airport disruptions in Denmark, Norway, and Germany.

Kallas is scheduled to chair a meeting of EU defense ministers in Brussels on Oct. 15, where the European officials ""will exchange views on defense readiness.""

Senior News Editor

Martin Fornusek is a news editor at the Kyiv Independent. He has previously worked as a news content editor at the media company Newsmatics and is a contributor to Euromaidan Press. He was also volunteering as an editor and translator at the Czech-language version of Ukraïner. Martin studied at Masaryk University in Brno, Czechia, holding a bachelor's degree in security studies and history and a master's degree in conflict and democracy studies.

The latest news about Russia's war against Ukraine.

Leaders signed the peace deal during a summit in Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt later in the day.



""What a change from the 1984 Tom Clancy novel The Hunt for Red October. Today, it seems more like the hunt for the nearest mechanic,"" NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said.

 In Donetsk Oblast, volunteers from across the world serve in the International Battalion of Ukraine's Azov Corps. On the battlefield dominated by drones, constant surveillance, and high-risk rotations, they navigate daily life and combat in one of the war's most dangerous sectors.

The meeting, scheduled for Oct. 17, will follow two phone calls between the two leaders regarding Ukraine's air defenses and long-range capabilities.





The Kyiv Independent is pleased to announce its first ever live event in New York City, where the team will share stories from the life of a newsroom in times of war.

Ukrainian troops have liberated the village of Mali Shcherbaky in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukraine's 24th Separate Assault Battalion ""Aidar"" announced on Oct. 12, releasing footage purportedly showing Ukrainian soldiers in the settlement.

Speaking about past negotiations with Moscow, Trump said U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff ""had no idea about Russia, had no idea about Putin too much"" at the time.

""We can't simply wait and assume that a potential Russian attack won't come before 2029,"" German intelligence chief Martin Jaeger said. ""We're already under fire today.""

This result contrasts with the relatively high level of trust he continues to enjoy among the public, according to the KIIS poll.

Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, arrived in Kyiv on Oct. 13 for discussions with the Ukrainian officials on financial and military support.

""The topic of Tomahawks is of extreme concern,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Oct. 12. ""Just imagine: a long-range missile is launched and is flying and we know that it could be nuclear.""","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Ukrainian drones struck the largest Russian oil depot in the city of Feodosia in occupied Crimea overnight on Oct. 13 sparking a massive blaze, a source in Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent.

Videos shared on social media during the night showed a large blaze and thick black smoke rising from the depot. Residents reported that the glow from the fire was visible from various parts of the city.

The source said an electricity substation in Feodosia had also been hit, as well as another in Simferopol.

""The SBU continues to systematically reduce the enemy's military, logistical and economic capacity to wage war against Ukraine,"" they added.

Russian air defenses intercepted 103 drones overnight across Russian and occupied Ukrainian territories, including 40 over Crimea, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed.

The strike reportedly occurred around midnight, marking the second attack on the facility in a week — the previous one took place on Oct. 6, according to the Crimean Wind Telegram channel.

Aksyonov said emergency services were responding at the site and reported no casualties.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims

The oil depot in Feodosia is a multifunctional facility used for the transshipment of oil and oil products between rail tankers, sea vessels, and road transport. 

Located about 250 kilometers (155 miles) from Ukraine-controlled territory, it is the largest oil storage facility in Crimea. It can hold up to 250,000 tons of fuel, which supplies Russian forces.

Ukrainian forces routinely target Russian oil infrastructure, a critical financial resource fueling Moscow's full-scale war.

Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Oct. 11 that Russia's oil processing capacity has dropped by 21% amid Ukrainian attacks. Several Russian regions are facing gasoline shortages as Moscow ramps up fuel imports.

First came seven men, re-emerging from Gaza after 738 days of captivity.

Then came the remaining 13, their release inaugurating a momentous day for the Middle East more than two years after a Hamas-led attack on Israel sparked a war that killed tens of thousands. The 20 men were handed over by Hamas, marking the end of their captivity as the last hostages who are still alive after they were seized by militants on Oct. 7, 2023. 

“All of our living hostages have come back to us. What wonder,” Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday.

In Tel Aviv, thousands gathered to watch and cheer the return of the remaining living hostages, some wiping away tears as speakers swelled with the sounds of the song They're Coming Home.

Family and friends of Israeli hostages burst into tears and cheers of joy while watching their release. Parents of the hostages were taken to a military facility near Gaza border where they could see their loved ones being handed by the Red Cross to the Israeli army.

“It's the first time I'm crying. I didn't cry for two years,” said Gila Sharabani, a retired lawyer who spent hundreds of days at Hostage Square, a rallying point in central Tel Aviv, bringing hot tea to the families of people taken captive in Gaza and then returning, again and again, as a show of hope. 

“Happy is not the word. It's too small,” she said. 

“Unbelievable. Unbelievable.”

The remains of another 28 deceased hostages were also expected to be released, in exchange for 1,950 Palestinian prisoners. The prisoners began to be delivered by bus on Monday – but by evening, Hamas had promised to return the remains of only four of the dead captives.

World leaders gathering in Egypt throw their weight behind deal to end war in Gaza

The U.S. President came to greet released hostages and speak to the Knesset, Israel's Parliament, before planning a departure for Egypt for a peace conference intended to chart a new course for the war-torn region. Mr. Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas were both expected to attend that conference alongside numerous foreign leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. But Mr. Netanyahu has declined the invitation, his office said in a statement Monday, citing a conflict with a Jewish holiday.

“The release of hostages must be a turning point toward lasting peace,” Mr. Carney said in a statement, in which he paid tribute to Canadians killed in the Hamas-led attacks two years ago: Canadians Vivian Silver, Netta Epstein, Alexandre Look, Judih Weinstein, Shir Georgy, Ben Mizrachi, and Adi Vital-Kaploun.

Many in Israel mixed gratitude to the Israel Defense Forces with thanks to U.S. President Donald Trump, including some Knesset members who wore red ballcaps with the words: TRUMP THE PEACE PRESIDENT.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday declared a 'historic dawn of a new Middle East' in a speech to lawmakers in the Israeli parliament.

The Associated Press

“As far as I'm concerned, the war is over,” Mr. Trump said as he arrived at the Knesset, where Speaker Amir Ohana called him the best friend Israel has ever had. The U.S. President smiled as Knesset members chanted: “Thank you, Trump.”

Mr. Trump called Monday “the historic dawn of a new Middle East.”

The war in Gaza, he added, had been “getting bad. It was getting heated.” He recalled telling Mr. Netanyahu he would be remembered more for ceasing hostilities “than if you kept this thing going, going, going – kill, kill, kill.'” 

Mr. Trump promised the U.S. would be “a partner” in next stages for peace in the region, but made no commitment of troops or other tangible contributions to safeguard stability.

He received standing ovations for his speech, although two Knesset members were removed after holding up a sign protesting the U.S. President.

Mr. Netanyahu, meanwhile, struck a defiant note, telling critics of Israel's fierce war: “We were right.”

Israel killed more than 67,000 in its war on Gaza, most of them women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government. An independent United Nations commission said Israel had committed genocide, a charge Israel denies.

“Our enemies now understand just how powerful and just how determined Israel is. They understand that attacking Israel on Oct. 7 was a catastrophic mistake. They understand that Israel is strong, and that Israel is here to stay,” Mr. Netanyahu said.

Much remains uncertain, including how long the fragile ceasefire can hold, and what role Hamas will accept in Gaza, where its armed militants immediately returned to streets as hostilities with Israel ceased.

”The return of the hostages is one thing, but the end of the war, that's very important,” said Alex Grab, a retired history professor. In that, he said, “I'm not confident at all.” He trusts neither Hamas to keep its bargain, nor in Israel's Prime Minister to hold to his commitments to peace: “I don't think that Netanyahu is interested. He was forced to do this by Trump.”

The war, too, has left deep scars.

”Gaza was flattened, destroyed,” Mr. Grab said. “Israel is in crisis. Despite their success now, the euphoria now, I think Israel has got a lot of issues.”

But in Israel, the release of hostages marks the conclusion of a lengthy national agony. At the country's main airport, volunteers handed Israeli flags to arriving passengers. News footage of hostages moving in Red Cross vehicles was broadcast live in cafes, on phones and in countless living rooms across the country. Those pictures showed one hostage pumping his fist in celebration as he arrived in a hospital, while images distributed by the government showed young men embracing their families in emotional reunions.

”For a few days, we were very nervous, because we didn't know anyone's condition,” said Auneg Rahamim, whose husband's cousin is Matan Angrest, an Israeli soldier among those released Monday. 

“When we were told that he's walking on his feet and he's smiling and he's okay – nothing else matters.”

She patted her pregnant belly. “All we wanted was Matan to be back home to meet his future cousin,” she said at Ichilov Medical Center, where staff placed an enormous “Welcome” sign on the concrete outside the hospital, visible from the rooftop helipad where several hostages arrived early in the afternoon.

In a brief video call distributed on social media, Mr. Angrest said he had persevered “out of love for the country and the flag.” As friends gathered outside the hospital for a loud rendition of a football song, Mr. Angrest stuck his hands out from a hospital window, fingers dancing to the beat.

The return of hostages is “a hole in the heart that's getting filled now, and it's going to have to get healed,” said Camelia Mendelovich, a friend who has helped to support the family of Elkana Bohbot, who had helped to plan the music festival that was attacked by militants on Oct. 7, 2023.

The length of his captivity was evident in a sign Ms. Mendelovich carried, imprinted with 34, his age when he was taken hostage, scratched out and replaced with a 36, his age now. 

“Israeli resilience won,” said Yoseph Haddad, an influential social media personality with nearly a million followers on Instagram. 

“We've been in the last two years, fighting on seven fronts – Yemen, the Houthis; Lebanon, Hezbollah; Ansar Allah in Iraq; we have Syria; we have Hamas; the West Bank; the [Iranian Revolutionary Guards],” he said in an interview.

“And we're still standing. Standing tall.”

The Toronto Blue Jays gather for a group photo on the field after beating the New York Yankees in Game 4 of baseball's American League Division Series this past Wednesday in New York.Yuki Iwamura/The Associated Press

There's more than 4,000 kilometres between the home ballparks of the Toronto Blue Jays and the Seattle Mariners.

However, that huge travel distance for the teams to do battle in the American League Championship Series has opened the door for fans on Canada's west coast to make a much shorter trip to Seattle to cheer on their favourite team.

Regular season games in Seattle often have a home-like environment for the Jays with many Canadian fans willing to travel.

Here are some key things to know if you plan to come from British Columbia to Seattle for Games 3, 4, and 5 at T-Mobile Park starting Wednesday.

There are a number of ways to get yourself from British Columbia to Seattle.

The Amtrak Cascades train travels from Vancouver's Pacific Central Station to Seattle and a bus ticket bought through Amtrak will also take you between the cities.

As of Sunday afternoon, hours before the start of Game 1 in Toronto, the company website showed business class train tickets on Wednesday were already sold out, but some $117 one-way coach seats were still available for the four-and-a-half hour ride.

Bus tickets were still listed as available for approximately $70, one-way.

If travel by boat is more your speed, you can choose a ferry.

The Victoria Clipper fast ferry between Victoria and Seattle has added a special 11 a.m. “Playoff Express” sailing from Victoria on Wednesday.

The ferry will depart Victoria's Inner Harbour at 11 a.m., arriving in downtown Seattle around 2 p.m. and the company is promising “special themed drinks and décor to celebrate this historic face-off.”

Travelling to Seattle to see the Blue Jays in the ALCS? Here's some things to know.

The Canadian Press

Flying is also an option, with early morning one-way flights between Vancouver and Seattle on Wednesday cost around $400 as of Sunday afternoon.

Driving across the border will take you an estimated three hours through the Peace Arch border crossing.

T-Mobile Park's website makes a number of recommendations for getting to the game once you are in Seattle, including light rail, which makes stops within walking distance of the park as well as multiple bus routes.

The Washington State ferry terminal and King County Water Taxi terminal are less than two kilometres from the park.

If you haven't already booked a hotel to stay overnight in Seattle, be prepared to pay.

Hotel rooms for Wednesday's game near the ballpark appear to be nearly sold out, with some available within walking distance going to about $600 a night. 

Those looking for last minute tickets to Wednesday's game should also be prepared for some sticker shock.

Ticket resale website StubHub lists single tickets to the game at more than $300. A pair of tickets behind the Blue Jays' dugout will set you back more than $3,600 each.

Interested in more careers-related content? Check out our new weekly Work Life newsletter. Sent every Monday afternoon.

When British leadership development consultant Katie Best asked executives from 120 organizations to reveal their most pressing challenges, 50 per cent named leading change, 37 per cent executing strategy and 36 per cent motivating teams. 

“What I found particularly interesting was how very few people saw decision making and leading others as challenges. However, the research elsewhere repeatedly shows that leading others is one of the biggest complaints of those being led – that their leaders are not up to the job,” she noted in an email exchange after I read her book The Ten Toughest leadership Problems.

The 10 she chose to focus on aren't ranked in terms of most important or difficult to handle. Instead, she went from those most personally derived – ones where we get in the way of ourselves – to the biggest corporate problems. You may therefore want to rank them in importance yourself as you read the list: Personal effectiveness, decision-making, influence, individual performance, engagement, teamwork, hybrid and remote working, delivering on strategy, culture and values and leading change. You might also want to ponder the managers around you and what are the toughest for them; what is the organization, generally, struggling with most?

Most on her list are perennial issues but dealing with a remote and hybrid workforce is new, primarily a product of the past five years. Her approach is to dig in and define the issue clearly, because remote and hybrid work is an umbrella phrase for a number of specific tests it creates for managers – things we took for granted that we no longer can. 

She asks: Is it harder to talk – to know when somebody wants to chat with you or to check in with them? Are you under-sharing, as you stick to just the most important stuff with fewer chances to talk? Is online work leading to more distraction? Are team members finding it harder to create and innovate? Does there seem to be less trust, as is common with online connectivity compared to face-to-face? Is it harder to observe what others are doing? Is it harder to build careers, with fewer chances to network and share information? Are you finding a weakening of culture and values when you are no longer working in an office space loaded with the artifacts of culture and surrounded by people having conversations and interacting in a way that is culturally aligned? 

If you are in a position to develop the organization's policy, she reminds you that there are benefits from a remote and hybrid policy, notably autonomy and flexibility, a greater chance for deep work and the opportunity to reduce the time, money and carbon footprints. If the challenge you face is managing a remote or hybrid work force, she suggests concentrating on three key areas:

Of the other tough leadership problems she presents, influence is the one that probably gets the least attention, perhaps because it involves – or should involve – subtleties or because the idea of wielding power can be personally unsettling. 

“Establishing and using power and influence at work is always hard. And our increasingly flat hierarchies, which mean people aren't keen on being told what to do, have made it harder,” she writes in the book.

Dealing with the issue starts, she believes, by describing it specifically in a few sentences. Who are you trying to influence – are they a junior, a peer, a senior or a client? What have you done, if anything, to try to get them to do what you want them to do and why has your approach not worked? How do you think they see you? Do they see you as someone they are prepared to be influenced by?

 She highlights three common practices that can fail:

Sharpening your influence skills can help with the tough challenge of leading others, one of the challenges she suspects from her questionnaire leaders are less effective at than they believe.

The leaders of Germany's main intelligence services cautioned the government not to get complacent about Moscow and foreign extremists. Meanwhile, a major apartment fire injured dozens in Berlin. DW has more.

Here are all the latest headlines from Germany on Monday, October 13:

Due to the breaking news situation in the Middle East, our Germany blog is currently taking a break.

Read below about the annual public intelligence update to the Bundestag, a major housefire in Berlin, and Chancellor Merz's trip to Egypt.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz arrived in Egypt on Monday, one of many world leaders on hand for the official signing of the ceasefire dealand a summit about the future of Gaza. 

""From this place, the signal goes out that if the world community stands together, it is possible"" to achieve peace, he said.

He then called on Donald Trump to use the momentum gained at Sharm el-Sheikh to press Moscow to end the war in Ukraine. 

""We also hope that the American president will now use the influence he has exerted on the parties involved in the (Middle East) to work with us on the Russian government,"" Merz said.

Trump told reporters on Air Force One as he flew to the Middle East that he would consider arming Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles that would allow strikes deeper into Russia, but added that he may first speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin about it in a bid to end the war.

The leaders of Germany's two main intelligence services made their annual public statements to the Bundestag on Monday, saying the threats posed by Russia and by the Palestinian militant group Hamas should not be underestimated.

Sinan Selen, the head of the BfV, the country's domestic spy agency, said a recent peace deal for Gaza did not mean that there is a ""reason to sound the all-clear when it comes to Hamas and its activities in Europe and Germany.""

Selen said Hamas had ""infrastructure"" in Germany, and his office estimated that about 32,500 people living in the country can be classified as foreign extremists. This is an increase of 6% over the previous year. 

Martin Jäger, chief of the foreign intelligence service, the BND, said that the ""icy peace"" between Europe and Russia right now could at any moment become a ""hot confrontation."" 

To achieve its goal of broader political influence in Europe, ""Russia will not shy away from direct military confrontation with NATO if necessary,"" Jäger said, adding that sweeping propaganda efforts were already underway.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has left Berlin en route to Egypt, as world leaders gather to attend the official signing of the Israel-Hamas peace deal for Gaza.

Merz will be joined by French President Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, US President Donald Trump and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, among others.

The chancellor has hailed the truce as ""good news for people in the Middle East"" and the world over, promising €29 million ($33.6 million) in aid and that Germany would take part in a Gaza reconstruction conference soon to be held in Egypt.

At the same time, German-Israeli twin brothers Gali and Ziv Berman were reunited for the first time in two years as some of the last hostages held by Hamas to be released.

At least 46 people were injured after a fire broke out in a large social housing block in Berlin, firefighters said. Fifteen people were taken to local hospitals.

They said the blaze broke out after a suspected explosion, but no further details were immediately available.

The fire began on the ground floor and quickly spread before emergency services were able to fully put it out, allowing residents on the second floor and upward to return to their homes after an evacuation.

The High Deck housing estate is home to about 6,000 people in a series of 6-story apartment buildings in the capital's Neukölln district.

An investigation is underway to determine the cause of the blaze.

US President Trump has arrived in Egypt for a summit on Gaza, after Hamas freed all remaining living hostages. DW has the latest.

Below is a roundup of the main developments in Israel, Gaza and the Middle East on Monday, October 13:

During a bilateral meeting in Egypt, President Trump said that the second phase of peace negotiations between Hamas and Israel was already underway.

""It's started far as we're concerned,"" Trump told reporters while sitting next to Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fattah el-Sissi. ""As you know, the phases are all a little bit mixed up with each other,"" Trump said, adding that the Gaza Strip ""needs a lot of cleaning up.""

If you're just joining us, here are three helpful things to remember. One,Hamas has released all living Israeli hostages, and Israel has released nearly 2,000 Palestinians it had held under a US-led ceasefire deal.

US President Trump, whose administration brokered the deal, addressed the Israeli parliament, hailing the ""historic dawn of a new Middle East."" Trump then flew to Egypt to host a summit on Gaza, with at least 20 world leaders in attendance. 

And the return of bodies of just four hostages by Hamas has families accusing the militant group of violating the ceasefire agreement, with the Hostage and Missing Families Forum calling for an ""immediate suspension"" of the peace deal until every deceased hostage is returned. 

 

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi praised US President Donald Trump ahead of a summit aimed at supporting the ceasefire reached in Gaza.

According to el-Sissi, Trump was ""the only one"" who could bring peace to the region.

In return, Trump praised el-Sissi as ""very powerful,"" adding that Egypt has ""very little crime"" because ""they don't play games."" El-Sissi had led the military overthrow of Egypt's first democratically elected president in 2013.

Hamas has handed over the coffins of two dead hostages to the Red Cross, the Israeli military said.

The remains of two other hostages are also expected to be transferred to the aid today.

The militant group earlier this morning freed Israeli hostages in the first step of a long-awaited ceasefire deal. 

 

Red Cross officials were on their way to pick up a number of coffins bearing the remains of deceased hostages, the Israeli military said in a statement.

The Israeli military said the organization is ""on its way to the meeting point"" in the southern part of the Gaza Strip, where ""several coffins"" will be transferred into Red Cross custody.

Earlier Monday, Hamas said it would only return four of the 28 bodies held in the enclave on Monday. 

Palestinian militant group Hamas says it will release the bodies of four of the 28 deceased captives it holds.

The group should also release the remaining 24 bodies of hostages under the terms of the deal with Israel, although it was not yet clear if and when this would happen. 

The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents most family members of the Israeli hostages, called any c hange a ""violation of the agreement,"" and said it should be met with a ""very serious response.""

The group is calling for ""the immediate suspension of all agreement implementation"" until every deceased hostage is returned from Gaza.

As the ceasefire takes hold and leaders of Arab countries meet US President Trump in Egypt, key European leaders are playing a part and attending the summit.

Jean-Loup Samaan,  a senior research fellow at the Middle East Institute of the National University of Singapore and a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said European nations such as France, the UK and Germany might seek to play a bigger diplomatic role in Gaza's future. 

But, Samaan said, they would need the collective umbrella of the EU to be seen as a credible player by Middle Eastern nations. 

""There isn't a unified approach at the EU level as we've seen in past two years, if you look for instance at the positions of Spain and Hungary, which are vastly opposed on the topic,"" he said in reference to Spain's critical view of Israel and Hungary's support. 

The European Union's relations with Israel had deteriorated over the past few months as member states discussed arms embargoes and other measures to push Israel to end the war. The European Commission proposed sanctions and suspension of trade concessions.

As part of the ceasefire agreement, Israel released about 2,000 detained Palestinians. About 1,700, including children, had never been charged with an offense. Israel considers about 250 to be serious criminals, and 154 are slated for deportation to other countries after release.

 

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz arrived in Egypt on Monday, one of many world leaders on hand for the official signing of the ceasefire dealand a summit about the future of Gaza. 

""From this place, the signal goes out that if the world community stands together, it is possible"" to achieve peace, he said.

In an unexpected aside during his speech, Trump called on Israeli President Isaac Herzog to pardon Prime Minister Netanyahu, who is facing several bribery and corruption charges.

Calling Netanyahu ""one of the greatest"" wartime leaders, Trump said: ""I have an idea. Mr. President, why don't you give him a pardon?""

""By the way, that was not in the speech, as you probably know. But I happen to like this gentleman right over here,"" he said, gesturing to Netanyahu, ""and it just seems to make so much sense, you know.""

""You are a very popular man,"" Trump told Netanyahu. ""You know why? Because you know how to win.""

Many hearings related to the corruption cases against Netanyahu, some of his aides and his wife have been postponed for the past two years. 

The Israeli president is the head of state, whose role is mostly ceremonial, and the prime minister is the head of government. According to Israeli law, a president cannot stop an ongoing trial, and could only issue a pardon after conviction.

We're switching editors and writers, and if you're joining us now, here's what you need to know so far:

US President Donald Trump is in Israel, where he addressed the parliament, the Knesset, telling lawmakers that leaders had won ""all they they can by force of arms."" Trump expressed optimism about the region's future.

The US president is next headed to Egypt to sign an agreement on the plan to end the war in Gaza. As many as 20 heads of state and government, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, are attending Monday's summit in Egypt. 

Hamas released all living Israeli hostages held in the Gaza Strip. The militant group had pledged to release the hostages by Monday in exchange for 250 prisoners serving life sentences and more than 1,700 Palestinians detained after the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led terror attacks in Israel.

In his Knesset speech, Trump went on to say that ""the forces of chaos that have plagued the region are totally defeated.""

""The enemies of all civilization are in retreat,"" he said.

With longtime President Paul Biya facing a divided opposition, more than 8 million Cameroonians voted. Though there was peace at the polls, critics question the fairness and transparency of the electoral process.

After Sunday's presidential election in Cameroon, the question now is whether nonagenarian Paul Biya — the oldest president in the world — will extend his term by another seven years. Facing him is a fragmented opposition that wants to break Biya's long-unshakable rule in Cameroon. 

Sunday's voting proceeded largely smoothly and without significant difficulties, Celestin Tabouli Succes, a journalist from the northern city of Maroua, told DW.

In a rare public appearance at a large rally in Maroua, the capital of Cameroon's Far North region, a week before the October 12 election, Biya promised to strengthen regional security, fight youth unemployment and improve the nation's infrastructure.

In Cameroon's English-speaking Northwest and Southwest regions, extra troops were deployed to protect the vote following threats to disrupt the election from separatist groups aiming to establish an independent state.

""There were isolated incidents in the morning in some villages near the Nigerian border,"" Succes said. He added that affected polling stations had been relocated to protected places for security reasons.

""It was also noticeable that in the Far North — at the few polling stations I was able to visit — only representatives of three parties were present: the ruling party Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (RDPC), and the National Union for Democracy and Progress (UNDP) of Bello Bouba Maigari,"" Succes said.

""Other parties participating in the election were not represented at the polling stations in Maroua,"" he said.

About 8 million citizens, including over 34,000 overseas voters, were eligible to cast ballots at more than 31,000 polling stations. Cameroon is home to more than 29 million people, 13.7 million of whom are under 18, based on 2023 data from the United Nations. 

Violet Fokum, a Cameroonian governance and elections analyst, told DW that there had been a ""significant increase"" in the number of registered voters.

""We have done a lot of awareness-raising so that people register to vote,"" she said. 

To ensure that voters' ballots remain unaltered and respected, Cameroonian civil society had already mobilized independently before the elections, said Michele Ndoki, a renowned lawyer and committed civil society representative.

""Especially remarkable is the voluntary engagement of many young people who developed digital solutions to transparently document and make accessible the election information collected on site,"" Ndoki said.

Although the results are expected within the next 15 days and there are no voter surveys, analysts predict a victory for Biya.

If reelected, the 92-year-old would be 99 at the end of his term.

Biya came to power in 1982, after the resignation of Cameroon's first president, Ahmadou Ahidjo, and has ruled ever since. He has been declared winner of seven consecutive elections.

Cameroon's best-known opposition candidate, Maurice Kamto, was previously excluded from the election after the commission declared in July that his party had violated the nomination rules.

Critics condemned this decision as politically motivated, saying it was a setback for hopes of a free, fair and transparent election. 

Biya's main competitors are Bello Bouba Maigari, former tourism minister, and Issa Tchiroma Bakary, former employment minister.

""This election comes at a time when the whole nation aspires for change,"" Tchiroma said after voting in his hometown of Garoua, in the North region.

Tchiroma urged voters to remain vigilant and make sure that the results announced by the Constitutional Council reflect the result from ballot boxes. In a sign of rising tensions around the election, a Reuters journalist saw security forces fire teargas to disperse hundreds of Tchiroma's supporters, who tried to gather around his residence in Garoua after the area was cordoned off.

""A victory for Paul Biya is likely,"" said Marie Flore Mboussi, a member of Maurice Kamto's Cameroon Renaissance Movement who supports opposition candidate Issa Tchiroma Bakary.

""Mr. Biya currently controls the electoral system,"" Mboussi said. ""The Constitutional Council, which is responsible for announcing the results, has eight members, all of whom are appointed by members of the ruling party and their chairmen.""

Mboussi said Biya would only win ""because the Constitutional Council, which is devoted to his cause, will declare him the winner.”

She said a victory for the opposition would be well-deserved.

""The opposition has worked hard during this election and has mobilized its supporters,"" Mboussi said.

""No one has mobilized more supporters than Issa Tchiroma Bakary and Cabral Libii,"" she said. ""So it is only fair that, in view of all this, the opposition deserves to win this election. But, as we are aware of what is going on, we are aware of the RDPC's stranglehold on the electoral system, we cannot say that the most likely outcome will be a victory for the opposition.""

In about two weeks, Cameroonians will know whether Biya's rule will be over after 43 years — or if he will enter an eighth term.

In 2010, an Enbridge pipeline burst. Tribes are concerned about another one built without their permission 72 years ago.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

This Indigenous Peoples Day, the approximately 2,700 Ojibwe tribal members of the Bay Mills Indian Community in northern Michigan are marking the holiday amid fear that their region could face another environmental catastrophe like the one that occurred in 2010, when Enbridge's Line 6B oil pipeline burst and spilled over a million gallons of tar sands crude oil, contaminating the Kalamazoo River and over 40 miles in its watershed.

Today, the community is afraid that an even more potentially devastating event is looming: a future rupture of another Enbridge relic, the antiquated 72-year-old Line 5 pipeline, which originates and ends in Canada but travels across Wisconsin and Michigan, and crucially, through the Great Lakes under the Straits of Mackinac.

“There were two questions everyone asked when Line 6B broke,” tribal president Whitney Gravelle told Truthout. “It felt like the entire state of Michigan was like, ‘There's pipelines in Michigan? 'And then… ‘Where are they?'” After members of the public learned that Line 5 ran under the Straits where Lakes Michigan and Huron conjoin, and that it had been installed in 1953 without consideration of treaties with the Anishinaabeg tribes — the Ojibwe, Odawa and Potawatomi — or even informing them, the momentum to decommission Line 5 really grew, she said. Fifteen years later, the fight to uphold their rights under the Washington Treaty of 1836 — and to forestall a monumental tragedy for all of humanity — is still ongoing, as every passing day without a spill in the Straits is a tenuous miracle defying increasingly losing odds.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Fifteen attorneys from Earthjustice and Native American Rights Fund, plus their internal team, have been writing comments and briefs; collecting evidence; and submitting documents, information, and expert testimonies in order to push multiple federal agencies to eradicate the risks to the waters that comprise 20 percent of the world's remaining fresh water supply and provide drinking water for 40 million people in the U.S. and Canada.

“The Environmental Protection Agency only responds if there's an oil spill on land,” Gravelle explained, “while the U.S. Coast Guard responds if there's an oil spill on water. We've challenged them both with our worst-case scenario: ‘What if there's an oil spill in January, and the straits are covered with ice? What are you able to do when the break is four miles beneath the water, pluming oil up, and covered in a foot of ice. How are you gonna get to it? How?' They have no answer, they just stare at us blankly.”

The unfortunate reality is that even without a catastrophic oil spill, the Great Lakes are under serious threats from climate change; extractive industry; plastic and shipping pollution; invasive species like the Quagga mussels; algae blooms in Lake Erie; and what Gravelle described as a general lack of care. “We have seen a major decline in the volume of our treaty fishery as well as a major decline in the water quality of the Great Lakes,” she said. The pipeline, built to last 50 years but already operating over 70, has spilled oil multiple times along its 645 miles, sometimes in their treaty territory. The single 30-inch pipeline becomes two 20-inch pipelines for the 4.5 miles it runs under the Straits “and if it opens in the straits, that's the be all and end all. We're done after that, the Great Lakes are done,” Gravelle warned. “That's the heart attack that kills the Great Lakes.”

It would also be an attack on the fundamental way of life for Anishinaabeg, whose teachings passed down from time immemorial describe the relationship between humans and the waters as sacred and reciprocal — “If we take care of the lakes, they will take care of us,” Gravelle said. “That's why we do the work we're doing.” But their resistance, inspired by the Idle No More movement and the uprising against DAPL at Standing Rock, has been frustrated, especially since Trump's Day One executive order declaring a national energy emergency. That order, Gravelle said, empowered Enbridge, which is aggressively pursuing three permits to build the Great Lakes Tunnel, a never-before attempted feat of engineering that will try to encase Line 5 in concrete and move it from where it currently is on the lake bed. One permit was granted from the Michigan Public Service Commission, but an appeal will be heard by the Michigan Supreme Court; another is before the Environment Great Lakes and Energy Division, and is currently in a comment period; and a third from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is expected to be granted. Additionally, there are two cases proceeding in federal court with the state of Michigan, one in which Attorney General Dana Nessel sued Enbridge under the Public Trust Doctrine to permanently remove Line 5 and another, where Enbridge sued Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer for revoking their permits to operate on the lake bed, which is on its way to the U.S. Supreme Court — a turn of events Gravelle calls “worrisome.”

In the weeks running up to Indigenous People's Day, the broader communal focus turned to ceremony, culture, history, community engagement, and preparing for the traditional harvest of manoomin (wild rice). Members of all three confederated tribes — the Ojibwe, Odawa and Potawatomi — and their guests were invited to build a lodge and gather for Three Fires, One People, “a four-day ceremony held on the north and south shores of the Straits of Mackinac with fires lit on each side of the water. We gather to honor the ancestors who rest here, to lift prayers and make offerings together.”

Paula Carrick, the tribal historic preservation officer in the Bay Mills history department, told Truthout that manoomin was essential to their origin story.

“At the beginning of time, we came from the great salt seas of the east, and we were told to leave the east to go and find the food that grows on water — manoomin,” she said. According to teachings, their ancestors were led west by ajiijack (cranes), who brought them to the rapids where the St. Marys River reached Lake Superior, which is how they became Boweting inini — the People of the Falls.

“This is where we ended up, Ontario is just across the river,” Carrick said, pointing to the mountains that explain why Enbridge found it cheaper to build their pipeline on the U.S. side where the terrain is flatter, having been carved out by an enormous glacier.

The common wisdom is that the Ojibwe were not forcibly removed to Oklahoma like the tribes in Southern Michigan because the fur traders and settlers that might've displaced them could not survive so far north without them. “They would've starved, sickened and died if we hadn't helped them,” Carrick said. But ownership of the territory of their ancestral lands was greatly curtailed.

“These waters are everything to us — we work with clams shells in art or crushed for binder in pottery, we eat clams too. We make clay pots — slab and coil or pinch pots — the clay comes from the Big Lake [Lake Superior]. We fish of course, commercially and subsistence fishing, we have cranberry bogs,” Carrick explained. Traditionally, they also used the markings on the shells of sand turtles for calendars — 13 spaces (moons) ringed by 28 smaller spaces. “Everything about us is connected to the water.”

Carrick's colleague, archivist Kayla Perron Assinewe, has assumed a leadership role in restoring the community's relationship to manoomin, which was largely eradicated in the area by loggers who dynamited stacks of logs on the shore to float them down the river. She has organized the community to seed the waters with 800 pounds of wild rice seed, scattered from rice buckets on canoes.

Assinewe is the first to admit the seeds stink. “They smell like manure,” she said.

“But when you plant a manoomin seed, it has these little barbs on the end, so it torpedoes down when it drops, and then it hits that surface layer, and on that little barb it hangs in there and germinates through the winter. Then it will grow in the spring.”

Both Carrick and Assinewe are drawn to the story of Ozhaguscodaywayquay, who was married at age 14 to an Irish trader John Johnston, but maintained her cultural practices. In their joint telling:

The story with her is that she didn't want to come here from Wisconsin. No, she didn't. They forced her here, and they said that when she first got here, she sat in the corner of the room, put a blanket over her head, and wouldn't leave the room or talk to anyone forever. And then she ran away home, didn't she? She ran away home, and her father was mad and sent her back, and sent her brother back with her to make sure she stayed here. Then her husband bought her this fancy stove, and she took it and threw it out in the yard and refused. She only cooked over a fire. She still only spoke Anishinaabemowin. She had her medicine garden. She refused to transition to the modern times. Our ways were her heart.

Allyn Cameron, who directs the Bay Mills Cultural Program, told Truthout that the Straits of Mackinac are very dear to the community, though they're 50 miles away.

“When we talk about Mackinac Island, the Straits of Mackinac, the whole Great Lakes area, we call that the heart of Turtle Island,” Cameron explained. “Our people, historically, moved all through this area, the straits, through Boweting, [the city of] Sault Ste. Marie, and we worked and lived and cycled all around based on the seasons, the fish that were available, the foods that were available, where the good hunting was, where the good berries were. We moved into the straits area to help trade and move things and survive, so that area is really significant to us.”

With that migration came dispersed burial grounds, many of them so old or remote as to be unmarked. The most gruesome aspect of his job is confronting the reality of grave robbing. “We have people out there with metal detectors, and they dig through all these old graves looking for anything they can put on the market, anything of value. A lot of these old artifacts that come up that you may see at auction, there's a good chance they may have been looted,” said Cameron.

But for Cameron, nothing compares to the crime of allowing for the possibility of the Great Lakes to become Enbridge's ecological wasteland when Line 5 inevitably ruptures.

“We go to the faucet, we turn it on, we get a drink of water, it's easy to become complacent,” he says. “But I've been in ceremonies that helped me to understand what our four-legged and winged relatives go through, and so we have that empathy, compassion, and that understanding that sometimes we need to slow our world. We're only just a part of creation.”

Above all, he said, he has a great respect for the powers of the water, and for that reason, he doesn't go out on the ice much. Cameron remembers when his good buddy talked him into going ice fishing a little late in the season, when most of the fishing shacks had already been removed from the ice.

“I'm looking out, I can see pressure cracks on the ice. And as I'm taking a step, I see water at the pressure crack. He kept saying, ‘It'll be fine, don't worry.' So I get a line and throw it over into the water. And no sooner did I throw it, I heard a splash and turned around. There's my cousin standing on the ice, dripping because he went down and he was right back up. We tiptoed off that little lake.”

Through the obvious perils, Gravelle, who is a lawyer and served as a tribal attorney and tribal judge before being elected president, holds one particular treaty provision especially dear to maintain a holistic clarity as to her mission and her relationship with creation.

“Our treaty says the tribes in the area would continue to maintain the ‘usual privileges of occupancy in the treaty ceded territory.' And I always like to highlight that language — the usual privileges of occupancy — because it's not just the right to fish, it's also the right to dance with the fish,” she said. “Because when you dance with fish, it's about you going out, learning where to fish from your uncles, bringing that fish home, learning how to cook that fish with your mom, bringing that fish to ceremony, eating it with your elders, dancing in ceremony. And yeah, we do play with fish, and laugh with fish, and dance with fish. It is part of who we are. And so for me, in dignity, our Indigenous people say our ancestors fought for that language to be included in the treaty — the usual privileges of occupancy. There are reasons they wanted that language there.”

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya was seized by the Israeli military in December 2024 after it raided Kamal Adwan Hospital in Gaza.

As families on Monday celebrated the return of about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and 20 living Israeli hostages after the two-year Israeli bombardment that has killed more than 67,000 people and left rubble across Gaza, advocates demanded the return of Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, who was captured nearly a year ago and has reportedly been imprisoned in a detention center known for torturing detainees.

Middle East Eye reported Monday morning that according to Israeli media reports, Abu Safiya was on a list of Palestinian prisoners who would be released only “if the number of those released is not completed.”

“The government has approved the creation of a reserve list of five prisoners from Gaza, who will be released if changes are made,” according to Israeli media reports.

Palestinian writer and poet Mosab Abu Toha noted that “if he and the others are approved, they would replace five other Palestinian hostages who were previously set for release.”

I'm not sure who else has shared this, but regarding Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, his name, along with four others, has reportedly been submitted for approval by the Israeli government. This is according to Israeli Channel 12. A phone vote is expected to take place.It's important to… pic.twitter.com/bJFvWOKKIO

Abu Safiya was seized by the Israel Defense Forces in December 2024 after the IDF raided Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahia, where he was the medical director.

The IDF claimed without evidence that Kamal Adwan Hospital was a Hamas command center; it was the last major functioning health facility in northern Gaza when it was attacked.

As the exchange of hostages and prisoners neared over the weekend, advocates including healthcare professionals demanded that Abu Safiya be included in the exchange.

“I am a family doctor and public health practitioner. I have studied the impacts of settler colonialism on health, locally and abroad. I am demanding for the immediate and unconditional release of Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya who is being held captive by the Israeli military for fulfilling his duty and calling to protect his patients,” said Dr. Yipeng Ge. “I am calling for protection of hospitals, patients, and health workers in Gaza.”

Abu Safiya is one of more than 9,600 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons, according to Israeli human rights group B'Tselem.

The prisoners being released on Monday include 1,700 Palestinians who were detained after Israel began its bombardment of Gaza in retaliation for a Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023.

At least 154 Palestinian prisoners freed on Monday were forced into exile by Israel and deported to third countries.

On Saturday, the Council on American-Islamic Relations called on the Trump administration to “demand that Israel release Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya and all other kidnapped medical professionals.”

Francesca Albanese, United Nations rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, suggested that the international acceptance of the continued detention of Abu Safiya and thousands of people in Israeli prisons, many of whom have been held without charges and were detained as minors, “says a lot about [the] peace that lays ahead, for the Palestinians.”

“There cannot be peace without justice, human rights, and dignity of ALL,” said Albanese. “Palestinian lives matter.”

The prisoner-hostage exchange is a major part of the first phase of the 20-point peace plan proposed by President Donald Trump, with the next phases yet to be negotiated.

Trump's attacks on Native sovereignty and citizenship are a deliberate effort to undermine the rights of tribal nations.

Indigenous Peoples' Day has always been an act of celebration, resistance, and truth. When we gather and organize for Indigenous Peoples' Day, we affirm that we are still here. It is a reminder that our stories did not begin with Columbus, and they do not end with the myth of American exceptionalism and conquest. But today, it carries an urgency we can't ignore. In the current political climate, that affirmation takes on new meaning as questions about the legitimacy of our U.S. citizenship are raised in efforts to end birthright citizenship and erase the political existence of Native nations.

On October 9, 2025, Trump issued the 2025 Columbus Day Proclamation, declaring Christopher Columbus “a visionary who paved the way for the founding of our great Nation.” He urged Americans to honor “the values of courage, faith, and discovery that built Western civilization.”

In the proclamation, Trump made no mention of Indigenous people, unless you count the mention of a “vicious and merciless campaign to erase our history, slander our heroes, and attack our heritage.” The wording of Trump's phrase echoes a similar line in the Declaration of Independence, which accuses King George III of acting against the colonists who opposed British rule by colluding with “the merciless Indian Savages, whose known Rule of Warfare, is an undistinguished Destruction, of all Ages, Sexes and Conditions.” Instead of taking the opportunity to acknowledge Indigenous Peoples' Day, Trump doubled down on a myth of discovery that glorifies genocide and rebrands colonization as destiny.

This same worldview underpins Trump's renewed effort to end birthright citizenship, a move that threatens not only immigrants but also the very foundation of Native existence. In one of the administration's own legal arguments, officials claimed, “The United States' connection with the children of illegal aliens and temporary visitors is weaker than its connection with members of Indian tribes. If the latter link is insufficient for birthright citizenship, the former certainly is.”

This suggests that tribal citizenship, the political relationship that predates the United States itself, is somehow incompatible with being American. It echoes the logic used to justify centuries of termination policies, removal, and forced dependency.

The Trump administration's attacks on birthright citizenship do not just threaten immigrant communities. They strike at the very heart of Indigenous sovereignty. They threaten to bring back an era of termination and removal, creating the conditions for Native people to once again be treated as wards of the state, stripped of rights, and relocated to lands or countries we have never set foot in.

Recent reports from the Oregon Capital Chronicle describe how Navajo citizens were detained in immigration sweeps across border states, raising alarm among tribal leaders who warn that racial profiling and the refusal to recognize tribal identification put Indigenous people in the same danger as undocumented immigrants.

Indigenous Peoples' Day has never been just a celebration. It is a call to action against the ongoing assault on our sovereignty and existence

The American Immigration Council has also warned that the Supreme Court's refusal to restrict racial profiling in immigration raids has encouraged law enforcement to target anyone who looks “foreign,” a pattern that puts Indigenous people at particular risk because our identities and documents are not consistently recognized or treated as valid government documents.

Tribal Nations have alerted their citizens to this threat, suggesting they carry their tribal IDs, Certificate of Indian Blood (CIB), passports, and other photo IDs to help reduce the risk of detainment in the event of ICE raids.

The Indian Law Resource Center also reminds us that many of those being deported are Indigenous people themselves. The center has raised concern over the planned deportation of more than 600 Guatemalan children, at least 90 percent of whom are Maya, stressing that these children are Indigenous and have rights under both U.S. and international law.

Indigenous Peoples' Day has never been just a celebration. It is a call to action against the ongoing assault on our sovereignty and existence — and an assertion that, despite these threats, we will not be erased, silenced, or eradicated.

Indigenous Peoples' Day stands in defiance of a nation that has always treated Native sovereignty as an obstacle to overcome in upholding the myth of Manifest Destiny. In 1871, the Indian Appropriations Act ended the recognition of tribes as sovereign nations. With that single act, Congress declared that no tribe would be acknowledged as an independent power capable of making treaties. Our nations were reduced to wards of the state, entirely dependent on the same government that had stolen our lands.

The Dawes Act of 1887 went further. It divided tribal lands into individual allotments and stripped millions of acres from Native control. It was designed to assimilate Natives into mainstream society and dismantle tribal sovereignty, breaking apart communities and leaving many Natives impoverished and landless. The act also tied land allotments to U.S. citizenship, granting it to those who accepted allotments, severed their tribal affiliations, and left reservations, making citizenship a tool of assimilation rather than recognition of rights.

With the 1934 passage of the Indian Reorganization Act, also known as the Wheeler-Howard Act, tribes regained a measure of sovereignty. The Indian Reorganization Act allowed tribes to re-establish governments and manage their own lands, but the recognition came with heavy federal oversight. Yet even within those restrictions, our nations rebuilt and strengthened the scope and boundaries of our sovereignty.

As Native peoples, we are citizens of the United States, but we are also citizens of our tribal nations. The Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 extended U.S. citizenship to all Native Americans without requiring them to sever their tribal affiliations, as was previously necessary. The Act created a dual framework, where we not only have the right to self-determination but also hold rights and responsibilities in two nations simultaneously.

This reality is fragile, and not all Native nations share the same protection. As Teen Vogue reported, nearly 400 tribes in the United States lack federal recognition, which means they do not share the same nation-to-nation relationship that federally recognized tribes have with the U.S. government. This also leaves their people without the legal rights, resources, or protections guaranteed to federally recognized tribes. For these communities, the lack of recognition means they exist in a legal limbo when federal policy turns hostile.

As Dina Gilio-Whitaker, author and professor of American Indian studies and lecturer at the California Indian Culture and Sovereignty Center, explained to Truthout:

Tribal sovereignty as a legal principle and self-determination as tribal autonomy has always been what's at stake for tribal nations. Throughout U.S. history it has never been unassailable in U.S. law because of underlying logics of Euro-Christian superiority; that is what the doctrine of discovery is.

History has shown that while our sovereignty is an organic, inalienable right, it is not a fixed or guaranteed right in relation to the U.S. government. Indigenous nations must continually nurture the nation-to-nation relationship that we have and defend our sovereignty against political systems designed to limit or erase it.

If tribal sovereignty were ever dissolved as it was in 1871 with the Indian Appropriations Act, recognition of our tribal citizenship would disappear with it. If our U.S. citizenship were also revoked, we would be left stateless in our own homelands. That is the depth of what is at stake when sovereignty is undermined. Native identity, rights, and futures are tied to the recognition of both forms of citizenship, to the survival of our nations as sovereign powers, and to the protection of the land and water that sustain us.

The Trump administration's attacks on Native sovereignty and citizenship are not isolated incidents. They are part of a consistent effort to undermine the rights of tribal nations and the people who belong to them. Treaty obligations are dismissed whenever they conflict with corporate interests. Sacred lands such as Bears Ears and Oak Flat are stripped of federal protection and opened to mining and drilling. Pipelines are forced through Native territories without consultation or consent. Federal funding for housing, health care, and education — already limited in many communities — is repeatedly threatened, further weakening the foundations of Native life.

Native children face a direct threat to their connection to their nations through attacks on the Indian Child Welfare Act, which has been challenged in multiple cases in state and federal courts. Native tribes and organizations successfully defended and even expanded this law.

Passed in 1978 to stop the mass removal of Native children from their families and communities, the Indian Child Welfare Act protects the right of children to remain with their families, in their communities, and connected to their cultures.

The survival of our nations, our families, and our children hinges on protecting both our tribal and U.S. citizenship.

Despite ongoing challenges, the law remains one of the most important protections for tribal sovereignty and Native families. In June 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Indian Child Welfare Act's constitutionality in a 7–2 decision in Haaland v. Brackeen, rejecting all challenges to the law.

More recently, in August 2024, the California Supreme Court strengthened the Indian Child Welfare Act by requiring child welfare agencies to investigate a child's potential Native ancestry before separating families. But around the same time, the rejection of the Truth and Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policies Act denied survivors of cultural genocide a path to justice. The proposed commission would have investigated the legacy of Indian boarding schools and given survivors a chance to tell their stories and seek accountability.

Attacks on the Indian Child Welfare Act, birthright citizenship, and tribal sovereignty are interconnected. Each is a threat to the dual citizenship Native people hold. Undermining either form of citizenship puts Native people at risk of legal limbo, statelessness, and social and economic marginalization. The survival of our nations, our families, and our children hinges on protecting both our tribal and U.S. citizenship.

Despite continued threats to our sovereignty, Native nations, communities, and organizations use every means available, from the courts to direct action, to defend our rights and existence. The victories won and even the losses show that even in the face of systemic erasure and violence, Native people refuse to disappear, refuse to surrender.

The fight to protect Oak Flat in Arizona is a current example of this. Oak Flat, a sacred Apache site, is threatened by a copper mine authorized through a congressional land swap pushed by the Trump administration. Tribal leaders, activists, and allies organized to defend Oak Flat, arguing in court and mobilizing to ensure that sacred land is not exchanged and destroyed for foreign private profit.

As of October 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court has declined to hear further appeals, supporting lower court rulings that allow the transfer to proceed. However, a federal appeals court issued an emergency injunction blocking the transfer and delaying the mine's advance while legal challenges are considered.

At Standing Rock, hundreds of tribes and tens of thousands of allies gathered and occupied land near the Cannonball River in North Dakota to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline to protect treaty lands and water. Although the pipeline was completed, the resistance led to widespread awareness of Indigenous rights and environmental justice.

Standing Rock sparked solidarity actions around the world, inspired divestment campaigns targeting banks that financed the pipeline, and brought issues such as broken treaties, environmental racism, and missing and murdered Indigenous women into global conversations. It also resulted in ongoing legal challenges and inspired a new generation of Native activists who understand that sovereignty is not negotiable.

These interventions, whether through the courts or activism, are not symbolic but the literal defense of rights that are supposed to be guaranteed under tribal and U.S. law. It is the refusal to accept marginalization, neglect, erasure, and defeat. Indigenous Peoples' Day is both a reflection of these struggles and a call to continue the fight.

In this political landscape, Indigenous Peoples' Day reminds the public that the survival of Native nations is inseparable from Native sovereignty. When birthright citizenship is questioned, when sacred lands are desecrated, when funding for essential programs is threatened, and when cultural institutions are ignored or attacked, the very survival of our communities is at stake.

In an interview with Truthout, Dina Gilio-Whitaker explained:

Tribes will always be a threat to a certain segment of the American population (currently coded as Republican) because the doctrine of tribal sovereignty erects a system of guardrails to protect the rights that hundreds of treaties guaranteed, and the small amount of land that tribes still control. Those lands hold coveted resources that tribes have the power to choose to develop or keep in the ground.

Indigenous Peoples' Day calls on everyone to honor our survival and acknowledge the ongoing struggle against colonization and genocide. Our struggles are not isolated; they echo in other parts of the world, from the defense of our homelands here to the fight for survival in Gaza, where people continue to resist displacement and violence. It is a reminder that what happens to Native nations today is a glimpse of what can happen to any community when power goes unchecked and rights are violated. Indigenous Peoples' Day reminds us that defending our sovereignty is defending justice for all.



Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

 Phased Peace Agreements Have Worked Before in the Middle East

 Amr Hamzawy

As Western and international leaders take stock of the cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas that was signed in Egypt on October 9, many have raised doubts about the deal's phased structure. According to the 20-point plan announced by U.S. President Donald Trump, the initial stage that is now unfolding calls only for a partial or limited Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the release of the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas. The deeper issues, including questions over the postwar governance of Gaza and the stabilization force that will provide security in the territory, have been relegated to subsequent phases. To critics, the fact that these crucial issues have not been fully addressed at the outset suggests that the plan is bound to fail.

But the Trump plan's gradualism is hardly novel in the context of crisis diplomacy in the Middle East. On the contrary, a phased approach, addressing the challenges of both immediate de-escalation and long-term transitional management, has for decades been the most viable strategy to ending conflicts in the region. Indeed, for more than 75 years, many of the most crucial peace agreements, including the armistice that ended the 1948 Arab-Israeli war and the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty of 1979, have depended on such a structure. In both of these cases, preliminary agreements were followed by implementation phases, which required international or regional sponsorship to mobilize the political and technical tools needed to ensure compliance.

A close study of these historical examples shows that under the right conditions, phased agreements can not only withstand difficult challenges but also provide the incremental trust building and opportunities for negotiation that are necessary for more durable arrangements to take hold. The real challenge for the Trump plan, then, is not its phased structure. Rather, the overriding question is whether Washington and its international and regional partners can ensure that the necessary mechanisms, incentives, and penalties are in place to allow the subsequent steps the plan calls for to succeed.

Phased peace agreements have a long history in the Middle East. Take the 1949 armistice agreements between Israel and Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. The agreements were not final peace settlements but arrangements to halt fighting and establish Israel's de facto border, the so-called Green Line. The main function of the agreements was to provide space for de-escalation so that the groundwork for a transition to broader diplomatic arrangements could be established. Yet the agreements also contained practical mechanisms—field committees, UN monitoring, rules for prisoner exchanges, and provisions for humanitarian assistance.

In short, the armistice agreements created a temporary structure for the peaceful management of conflict in the Middle East, one that could either evolve or collapse depending on internal pressures and external guarantees. The 1949 agreements established a relative peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors that lasted until 1967, with the exception of the Suez crisis of 1956, in which France, Israel, and the United Kingdom invaded Egypt following the nationalization of the Suez Canal. The agreements' long-term success owed to the fact they were was backed by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States and monitored by UN missions, including a peacekeeping force at the Egyptian-Israeli border.

Phased agreements became even more important in the wake of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. It was in that era that mediation efforts became faster and more active: the shuttle diplomacy pursued by U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger led to successive disengagement agreements between Israel and Egypt and later between Israel and Syria. Each of these agreements was limited in military scope, involving only troop withdrawals, the creation of demilitarized zones, and measures to open communication channels and exchange prisoners. These steps resulted not from getting the belligerents to agree on an overarching settlement for a postwar order but rather from active U.S. sponsorship and technical enforcement of the agreements' aims.

In the case of Israel and Egypt, the disengagement agreements laid the groundwork for subsequent peace negotiations that culminated in the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty of 1979. In the case of Israel and Syria, the disengagement agreement signed in 1974 became a pillar of talks between the two parties in the early 1990s, when the United States and the Soviet Union launched the Madrid Peace Process for the Middle East, and is now once again at the core of the de-escalation negotiations between the Israeli government and Damascus.

In each of those instances, the United States did not stop mediating the moment an agreement was signed. Since U.S. officials were strongly invested in these deals and knew that American influence was at stake, Washington followed up with negotiation teams, diplomatic pressure, and aid or security packages to make sure the agreements did not collapse and could be reinforced in subsequent phases. The peace agreement between Israel and Hamas can be read in this light: the prominent involvement and leadership of the Trump administration in drafting and announcing the deal increases the likelihood that the United States will do what is necessary to ensure that the first phase leads to sustainable progress in successive stages.

Phased agreements can also lead to major breakthroughs. Among the most significant peace agreements since World War II were the Camp David accords, which led directly to the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. The accords did not seek an immediate resolution of all issues. Rather, they offered two frameworks, one for comprehensive peace between Israel and Egypt and another to address the Palestinian question and set the stage for future negotiations for Palestinian self-governance in the West Bank and Gaza. Although the latter was never fully implemented, by separating out these two tracks, the accords dialed down internal pressure in both countries and enabled the treaty to move forward.

Crucially, the accords were also accompanied by a U.S. commitment to facilitate negotiations, furnish aid to both countries, and ensure the parties' compliance. The treaty that followed the Camp David talks was, notably, implemented in stages, beginning with gradual withdrawals and territorial exchanges. American sponsorship of the treaty went well beyond the signing of the deal. To induce compliance, Washington provided not only diplomatic support but also extensive economic and military assistance to both sides. U.S. troops also participated in a multinational peacekeeping force along the border.

As the case of Egypt and Israel in the years after the 1973 war demonstrates, when phased agreements are coupled with concrete international commitments—including economic and security guarantees and the deployment of international peacekeeping or monitoring forces—an initial de-escalation and stabilization phase can lay the foundation for a broader and enduring transformation. Today, peace between Egypt and Israel remains one of the pillars of stability in the Middle East.



Another example of successful phased diplomacy is the 1994 Wadi Araba Treaty between Israel and Jordan. As with the Egyptian-Israeli treaty, it was carried out not in a single stroke but in successive stages. These phases included border demarcation; the reduction of each side's military presence along their shared border; arrangements for water sharing in the Jordan and Yarmuk Rivers and in the Araba region; economic cooperation, including the establishment of a free-trade zone; and successive security arrangements. Throughout this process, the United States acted as both the guarantor at the signing of the treaty and as an ongoing provider of guarantees and incentives to both sides. The success of the Wadi Araba Treaty was relative; in some areas, such as water-sharing arrangements and economic cooperation, its achievements have been limited. But overall, it demonstrated that bilateral agreements, when undergirded by long-term cooperation mechanisms and clearly articulated subsequent phases, can evolve into a sustainable system for managing complex conflicts—even ones that contain issues that resist final resolutions.

Of course, not all phased agreements have been successful. Consider the Oslo accords. When Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization signed the accords in 1993, the goal was to establish a multistage plan for enduring peace. Mutual recognition was to be followed by an interim stage, in which the newly created Palestinian Authority would govern the West Bank and Gaza, and Israeli troops would redeploy as Palestinian civil and security control gradually expanded. No later than the third year of the interim stage, permanent-status negotiations were to tackle issues such as borders, Israeli settlements, Palestinian refugees, and the status of Jerusalem. But the plan soon fell prey to shifting internal dynamics on both sides. Hard-line groups in Israel and in the Palestinian territories rejected the deal, and provocations led to renewed violence, causing the accords to unravel.

The larger lesson, however, was not about phasing but about implementation. The accords lacked the kinds of international commitments and effective enforcement tools necessary to ensure their survival under intense countervailing forces. The United States was not proactively involved in guaranteeing a good faith implementation of the plan, and there was no framework of incentives and sanctions to ensure compliance and progression. In the end, the Oslo accords largely failed not because they envisioned a gradual process but because that process was not sufficiently supported by the kinds of mechanisms, incentives, and pressure needed for success. Similarly, the January 2025 cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, a phased agreement that was meant to end the war in Gaza, also failed because of the absence of sustained U.S. involvement and the lack of regional and international pressures on Israel not to restart the war.

As Israel and Hamas undertake the first steps of the cease-fire, there is enormous hope that a more lasting settlement for Gaza can emerge. As these examples make clear, however, such an outcome is unlikely to happen on its own. As with previous phased agreements, the Gaza deal will require several decisive factors for continued success.

The first of these is sustained international and regional sponsorship. This means not merely the presence of the United States during the signing and the opening phase but also a clear commitment from Washington over the coming weeks that it will follow up, provide incentives, and impose sanctions when one or the other side fails to comply.

The presence of effective monitoring mechanisms is also critical. These may include joint committees, international monitoring missions, and possibly international peacekeeping forces. The Trump plan envisions an international stabilization force that will be tasked with various security duties, including overseeing the disarmament of Hamas. This force will also need to coordinate with humanitarian organizations to ensure the rapid provision of urgent relief. Without such concrete forms of international engagement, the deal may quickly erode.

Equally important, the United States and its international partners should tie specific incentives and sanctions to each phase of the deal. These could include postwar reconstruction, economic aid, security guarantees, and long-term diplomatic promises offered as inducements for compliance. Washington and its international and regional partners will need to manage local expectations, including by reassuring or accommodating influential domestic actors within both Israel and the Palestinian territories.



Finally, as past agreements have shown, flexibility is the key. Given the complex nature of regional conflicts, an overly rigid plan is not likely to yield long-term success, whereas a plan amenable to modification would allow for further negotiation, mediation, and corrective measures in the face of implementation impasses or failures. Each side may be tempted to use negotiations to avoid going forward with the more difficult phases of the deal, but the flexible nature of the agreement can allow international and regional mediators to create new incentives for compliance.

International and regional guarantors of the Gaza agreement must work to transform it into a detailed road map with measurable timelines, joint monitoring committees, reporting mechanisms for violations, and international peacekeeping forces. This will require sustained diplomatic engagement from Washington; regional actors such as Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey; and European countries and UN agencies.

To ensure successful transitions from one phase of the agreement to the next, the United States and its partners should offer both Israel and the Palestinians a broad array of incentives for compliance—and threaten significant sanctions for violations. For example, they can offer to reduce Israel's current diplomatic isolation in the Middle East and threaten to impose greater restrictions on arms sales. With regard to Hamas, disarmament can go hand in hand with a gradual rehabilitation of its rank and file (not the leadership), integrating them in the medium and lower strata of the newly built civilian administration for Gaza. To avoid Hamas' noncompliance with the provisions of the agreement, the United States and its partners can threaten a more immediate and aggressive destruction of the movement's remaining military and financial capabilities.

By adopting a phased agreement, the Trump administration has been able to get both sides to halt a terrible conflict and come to the table. The challenge now is to galvanize the deal's international backers to put in place what is necessary to sustain the agreement, regardless of the resistance it may face in both Israel and the Palestinian territories. Having fought a brutal war, both sides need to understand that the cost of failure is too high—and the benefits of compliance, however messy, too great—for the deal to collapse. But it will have to happen one step at a time.

 How the Anger Economy Will Supercharge Populism

 Beatrice Magistro, Sophie Borwein, R. Michael Alvarez, Bart Bonikowski, and Peter John Loewen

The AI economic transformation has begun. In May, IBM declared that it had fired hundreds of employees and replaced them with artificial intelligence chatbots. Over the summer, Salesforce let go of large numbers of people thanks to AI; UPS, JPMorgan Chase, and Wendy's are also slashing head counts as they automate more functions. College graduates are having a harder time finding entry-level jobs than they have in nearly a decade. And these trends are just the beginning. In survey after survey, corporations across the world say that they plan to use AI to transform their workforces.

Artificial intelligence will likely create new employment opportunities even as it disrupts existing ones, and economists disagree on whether the net effect will be job losses, job gains, or simply restructuring. But whatever the long-term consequences are, AI will soon become a major political issue. If there is significant disruption, officials will be confronted by workers furious about jobs lost to machines. Voters will make their frustrations known at the ballot box. Politicians will therefore have to come up with plans for protecting their constituents, and fast.

To create an effective strategy for addressing large-scale AI disruption, however, policymakers will need to understand how workers themselves perceive the technological threat. In November 2023, we surveyed 6,000 Americans and Canadians to gauge their level of concern about AI-induced mass layoffs and how the government should deal with the issue. Our findings revealed the scale of the challenge: respondents ranked fears about AI taking their jobs ahead of all other concerns about the technology, including its potential for military use.

When it comes to policy preferences, however, there is ground for both optimism and pessimism. On the positive side of the ledger, most respondents favored measures such as retraining programs and expanded safety nets—technocratic fixes that economists believe can work. But on the negative side, many also supported new trade restrictions and immigration barriers, strategies that could make the problem even worse and that governments may well be tempted, for political reasons, to adopt. Multiple countries, after all, responded to the layoffs created by offshoring with harsh tariffs and more deportations—even though neither technique worked. If they are serious about solving the problem and not incurring another round of populist backlash, policymakers should start rolling out the right responses now, before AI layoffs ramp up and while the most effective solutions still command widespread support.

To determine how voters want the government to manage AI layoffs, we did not conduct a simple poll. Instead, we wrote 81 scenarios involving either AI adoption or offshoring in which the economic shock had different effects on employment and prices. In one scenario, for instance, AI reduced smartphone prices by 50 percent while eliminating 25 percent of factory jobs and creating 25 percent more data science positions; in another, prices remained unchanged while customer service jobs decreased by 25 percent and factory employment stayed constant. We then gave respondents four of these scenarios to examine, each randomly chosen. We also presented respondents with a menu of possible policy responses—retraining programs, an expansion of the safety net, regulations to govern the economic shock they had seen (either AI deployment or offshoring), trade barriers, and immigration restrictions—and asked whether they supported each one. Respondents were randomly asked to evaluate either AI or offshoring scenarios, not both, allowing us to compare whether voters responded differently to domestic technological change versus foreign competition, and whether similar economic tradeoffs generated similar policy preferences across different types of disruption.

The results were clear. Regardless of what political party they belonged to, respondents in both countries ranked worker retraining as their preferred policy. Average support clocked in at four out of five, where one represents strong opposition and five strong support. Regulation of AI was the second most popular policy, also with broad support across the political spectrum. Expanding social spending, meanwhile, came in third—albeit with much less support among Republicans in the United States and slightly less support from conservatives in Canada.

These outcomes were encouraging. Ask economists what policy they would recommend in response to AI-driven layoffs, and most would say retraining, regulation, or social insurance. The logic is simple. Technological change can be slowed, but it is almost impossible to stop, and so the best thing governments can do for affected citizens is to give them new skills, set sensible guardrails, and create new unemployment benefits.

The problem is that governments today rarely put these policies into practice. In response to recent economic shocks, such as when trade slashed manufacturing jobs from wealthy countries, most states did not set up large retraining systems. The regulatory picture is equally grim. Despite the AI boom, few governments have passed comprehensive legislation related to AI—the European Union's AI Act being the notable exception. And safety-net expansions look even less likely, particularly at a time when many governments are laden with debt. In fact, Washington is slashing social programs, including public health insurance and nutritional assistance, as part of U.S. President Donald Trump's signature July spending bill.

Optimists might hope that as AI-induced disruption increases, policymakers will feel compelled to invest in retraining, social programs, regulations, or some combination thereof. But history suggests that the pressure to regulate and compensate could actually wane as the years go by. When it comes to economic dislocation, politicians face what social scientists call time-inconsistency problems. Before a disruptive technology is widely adopted—or a trade agreement is signed—those who stand to benefit have strong incentives to promise compensation to those who will lose out, in order to secure political buy-in. But once the technology is deployed or the agreement is in place, the incentives to follow through evaporate. Reversing the change becomes too costly for the state. The balance of power often shifts decisively toward the winners, who no longer need to placate the losers. The result is that compensation is underfunded, poorly implemented, or abandoned altogether.

The biggest risk, however, may not be that governments will ignore effective fixes. It is that they will adopt policies that will backfire. Many politicians, particularly on the populist right, might respond to AI layoffs by trying to restrict immigration and trade—just as they have to past economic problems.

If they do, the argument will be straightforward. If a government can't shield its people from competition by robots, then at least it can protect them from competition by foreigners. But this zero-sum logic does not hold up in practice. Virtually every piece of research suggests that restricting immigration and trade will not stop companies from adopting AI. In fact, it may hasten layoffs. Reducing trade, for example, will raise input costs, shrink export markets, and heighten policy uncertainty—pressures that make labor-saving technologies such as automation more attractive in exposed industries. Reducing immigration will further encourage AI use by increasing labor costs.

Analysts can try to make these likely consequences clear to voters. But protectionism often polls quite well, and substantial numbers of people already support such steps as responses to AI shocks. Overall, support for immigration restrictions averaged 3.4 out of 5.0 in our survey, while trade restrictions averaged 3.2. Among Republicans, the pattern is even more striking: support for immigration restrictions averaged 4.0 out of 5.0, making it their single most popular policy response, even higher than retraining. Trade restrictions came in at 3.5 among Republicans, roughly equal to retraining and well ahead of social spending. If AI layoffs keep rising, those figures could prove to be low-water marks. According to a study by the political scientist Nicole Wu, when Americans are told that robots threaten employment, Republicans become markedly more hostile to immigrants while Democrats turn against trade. Almost no one favors slowing the pace of AI itself.

There are other reasons why politicians might turn to exclusionary policies. One is that there are comparatively few barriers to implementing these kinds of measures. To set up and fund retraining programs, regulate AI, or expand social welfare, most governments would need to pass legislation and appropriate significant amounts of government spending. Deporting migrants, by contrast, rarely requires fresh laws, and can thus be done relatively quickly. Another is that immigration restrictions and tariffs yield clearly measurable results—thousands of foreigners gone, hundreds of millions of dollars in tariff revenue—in ways that other policies do not. Finally, nativism and protectionism offer voters someone or something to blame. It is easier, after all, to be angry at foreign workers and foreign products than it is to be angry at technological progress.

If voters embrace nativist policies in response to AI, they are unlikely to revert to more effective solutions. According to research on European democracies by the political scientists Alan Jacobs and Mark Kayser, when people negatively affected by economic change turn to far-right parties, they tend to stick with them. Politicians who profit by peddling anti-immigrant or anti-trade rhetoric certainly have few incentives to bring voters back to the center. In fact, some states and parties that have traditionally been hostile to immigration, including the Japanese government, are even outwardly promoting AI as a substitute for foreign workers.

Many of these findings seem to bode poorly for both the future of work and the future of democracy. But as our survey findings show, the right course of action—retraining, regulation, and social welfare—is also the one that people want most. If policymakers want to respond to popular demand, they could pass laws establishing and funding retraining programs that teach workers how to work alongside AI systems, develop skills in sectors less susceptible to automation, or transition into new roles created by AI. They could set up new income support programs for people caught between jobs. Finally, they could pass laws that regulate AI by requiring transparency in automated decision-making, mandating human oversight for high-stakes applications, and establishing liability frameworks for AI-caused harms, which would slow the most disruptive applications and ensure safer deployment without stifling innovation. Governments could pay for these proposals by taxing large AI companies. This would ensure that the businesses that profit from disruption also help manage its consequences.

These policies would not only help millions of workers. They could also help restore faith in government. By acknowledging workers who lose their employment to AI and offering them assistance, officials would demonstrate to voters that the state can, in fact, address their needs. In doing so, politicians would bolster their own political fortunes. According to research by the political economist Yotam Margalit, during the George W. Bush administration, incumbent parties performed better in counties where a larger share of laid-off workers qualified for retraining programs—evidence that voters' access to government support mutes their potential political backlash to job loss. (The United States has funded retraining programs, but not nearly enough.)

Time, however, is running out. AI adoption is accelerating, and its deleterious effects on employment are no longer a speculative problem. They are already widespread, and they will only accelerate in the months to come. Adaptive policies, meanwhile, will take years to yield results. If governments want to protect their economies—and themselves—they must act now.

Another 16 people were rescued in Kipnuk and authorities were working to confirm reports of additional missing individuals there, the department said.
    


            The sparsely populated villages are more than 400 miles southwest of Anchorage. “Both communities experienced strong winds and heavy flooding overnight, which caused significant damage, including at least eight homes being pushed from their foundations,” Alaska State Troopers said.
    


            Search efforts were expected to continue overnight as conditions allowed, with help from the Alaska Air National Guard, Alaska Army National Guard and the US Coast Guard, according to the public safety department.
    


            The storm generated wind gusts 100 mph or more in western Alaska Sunday, akin to the gusts Category 1 or 2 hurricanes are capable of. Wind gusts hit 107 mph in Kusilvak while nearby Toksook Bay recorded a gust of 100 mph, according to the National Weather Service.
    


            These winds also drove dangerous storm surge, pushing feet of water onto land, which triggered major flooding in coastal areas. Water levels in Kipnuk soared to 14.5 feet Sunday — more than 2 feet above major flood stage and 1.5 feet above the previous record flood level set in 2000.
    


            The storm was once Typhoon Halong, a powerful tropical system that formed in the northern Philippine Sea earlier this month, skirted by Japan without making landfall and then crossed the north Pacific Ocean. It was no longer tropical by the time it entered the Bering Sea this weekend, but that did not eliminate its power.
    


            The storm moved through northern Alaska late Sunday night and pushed into the Arctic Sea early Monday, leaving communities to pick up the pieces in its wake.
    


            “Every effort will be made to help those hit by this storm. Help is on the way,” Gov. Mike Dunleavy said in a statement Sunday announcing the expansion of a state disaster declaration to include the areas impacted by the weekend storm.
    


            The initial declaration, issued on Thursday, addressed damage in western Alaska caused by another powerful coastal storm earlier in the week that brought extensive flooding.
    


            Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan said he has “been in frequent conversations with Acting FEMA Director David Richardson, and also in contact with local, tribal and state officials, including the Governor, and with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.”
    


            “FEMA is in direct contact with state and local officials and has an incident management team traveling to Alaska as we speak with a FEMA search-and-rescue group pre-positioned in Washington on standby. According to FEMA, the government shutdown is not impacting the agency's response to this emergency,” Sullivan said in a statement.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Alaska National Guard, US Coast Guard, Alaska Rescue Coordination Center and the Alaska State Emergency Operations Center for more information.

Brett McGurk is a CNN global affairs analyst who served in senior national security positions under Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden.



            Over the next 24 hours, the world will witness  extraordinary scenes of hostages being released from Gaza and reunited with their families. President Donald Trump also addressed the Israeli Knesset, saying today marks the “historic dawn of a new Middle East” before world leaders convene in Egypt to discuss the subsequent phases of his 20-point plan for a longer-term peace and rehabilitation of Gaza.
    


            As this all unfolds, I'll be focused on three big questions:
    


            In the last hostage deal, one that I helped negotiate, Hamas used the ceasefire to crawl out of tunnels and reestablish control in Gaza. That meant killing Gazans who resisted Hamas and using the hostage exchanges as grotesque propaganda displays. This jeopardized any hope to extend the ceasefire earlier this year into a longer-term truce. This time around, Hamas appears to be doing the same thing, summarily rounding up Palestinians in the streets.
    


            But this time around is also different. The new deal allows Israeli forces to remain in more than half the Gaza strip, something Hamas before this year never would have accepted. It authorizes foreign military forces to come into those areas to ensure that Hamas can never return to them. The new deal also enjoys support from nearly all Arab and Muslim-majority states and calls on Hamas to disarm.
    


            Hamas will likely now turn its guns on innocent Palestinians, but its maneuvering room is limited.
    


            If all of Gaza is to be rehabilitated and reconstructed, Hamas must accept the deal in total and give up its false claim to authority in the Strip.
    


            The key elements of this deal beyond the hostage releases include the establishment of an interim security force and political structure for Gaza. If these structures are stood up, then the 20-point plan has a chance to succeed. If they are not, then Hamas over time could reestablish its authority by force, an outcome that forfeits any hope for longer-term peace or the rehabilitation of the Gaza Strip.
    


            This means focusing over the coming weeks on whether countries are prepared to contribute forces to an interim security force, and whether an interim governing entity can be stood up without devolving into months of quarreling. It is a good sign that the US military under Central Command is already establishing its positions outside of Gaza to help monitor the situation and ultimately enable such a force. US forces should not enter Gaza, but they will be essential to securing foreign troop contributions and ensuring such a force can succeed.
    


            On the political entity, it's ultimately up to Palestinians to determine who participates, but without US leadership, the process could devolve into months of wrangling, which would play into Hamas's hands.
    


            The reconstruction of Gaza will take a decade or more and hundreds of billions of dollars. Ten years ago, the US helped organize a global coalition and massive resources for the reconstruction of Mosul, in northern Iraq, which had been nearly destroyed in over a year of urban combat to defeat ISIS.
    


            Gaza is even more complex, with 300 miles of tunnels dug in multiple stories under the entire Strip, a construction effort that Hamas undertook over two decades without anyone working to stop it.
    


            Any hope for the rehabilitation of the Gaza strip requires a globally coordinated effort led by the US with participation of non-Hamas affiliated Palestinians, and the vast resources of America's regional partners and allies. This should be a focus of the summit in Cairo, and I'll be watching for specific commitments of resources as well as signs of an organized effort to plan and then implement reconstruction.
    


            Of course, if Hamas insists on remaining in control of the areas above the Israel lines under Trump's deal, then it will be Hamas that's blocking reconstruction of those areas. Absent Hamas relinquishing security control, few countries will be willing to come into Gaza or devote resources to its reconstruction.
    


            Over the next 24 hours, the focus will rightly be on the return of hostages after 740 horrific days in dark tunnels and unspeakable torture. Think about Evyatar David, 22 years old when taken hostage from a music festival and used repeatedly by Hamas in horrific propaganda videos: forced to watch the release of his friends, then returned to a tunnel, and later shown emaciated and digging his own grave.
    


            His treatment is a reminder of why there is no hope for Gaza nor for a future peace between Israelis and Palestinians if Hamas can cling to power by force of arms in Gaza. That is why beyond celebrating the return of the hostages, the focus must remain on what comes next, and the full implementation of President Trump's 20-point comprehensive plan.

            Federal safety regulators are once again looking into Tesla's self-driving mode, the latest in a seemingly endless stream of investigations into the safety of the technology.
    


            Last week, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced at least the sixth investigation into Tesla vehicles using the company's “Full Self Driving” (FSD), or other driver assist features. This probe covers dozens of dangerous driving incidents, including blowing through red lights, driving in the wrong lane of traffic, and three accidents that resulted in five injuries.
    


            But there's relatively little NHTSA, or any federal regulator, can do to regulate the new features Tesla introduces amid its ambitious plans to fill the country with self-driving cars and “robotaxis.”
    


            That's because it's not a regulator's job to approve the technology – only to rein it in if it causes problems. American laws aren't equipped to deal with the fast-moving ambitions of CEO Elon Musk, and Washington doesn't seem in a hurry to regulate his company.
    


            NHTSA already had several probes into Tesla's self-driving tech, including into incidents that resulted in fatal crashes, for both its FSD and less advanced driver assistance feature called “Autopilot.” But many of those investigations began years ago and are still ongoing, even as more and more Teslas with FSD and Autopilot hit American roads.
    


            “I call it regulatory whack-a-mole,” said Bryant Walker Smith, a professor of law and engineering and an affiliated scholar at the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School. “This process takes a very long time. This is the first step in multiple steps required for an actual recall. It's a regulatory process that isn't necessarily well aligned with the technological time frame.”
    


            Tesla is not unique. Despite what most drivers might believe about the safety of the new cars they buy, much of the regulation actually takes place after cars are already on the road.
    


            The United States has what's known as a self-certification regime. NHTSA creates specific standards and automakers then self-certify, or “promise that their vehicles or systems comply with those specific standards,” Smith said.
    


            But “if there's not a standard specific to a given technology, then there's nothing to self-certify. And NHTSA does not have specific standards for the performance of many advanced driver assistance systems,” he said.
    


Tesla under investigation after cars with the self-driving feature ran red lights, drove on the wrong side of the road



            But Smith added that problem is not simply cars with driver assistance features, but with all cars on the road.
    


            “We are all real-world guinea pigs in the century long experiment introducing two-ton vehicles that travel at speed faster than we can comprehend,” he said.
    


            NHTSA could set higher safety standards for vehicles, Smith said. But its ability to test vehicles and features before they are allowed on the road is limited by law and regulation.
    


            To give the agency the authority to approve or reject a new vehicle or feature before it is introduced into service, like the Federal Aviation Administration does with commercial aircraft, would require Congress to change the law.
    


            Smith said that change isn't going to be made any time soon. Besides the power of the auto industry, Americans have become accepting of the ten of thousands of car crash fatalities every year.
    


            He said they are more likely to blame the drivers than demand greater regulation.
    


            “That kind of approval applies to scary things, like nuclear power plants and planes and haircuts and initial stock offerings,” he said.
    


            Musk is betting the future of Tesla on technology like self-driving. But despite names like “full self-driving” and “autopilot,” the company admits that owners using those features need to be behind the wheel, ready to take over.
    


            But Tesla is beginning to plans to offer true driverless driving without anyone behind the wheel.
    


            The company launched its long-promised robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, earlier this year, although after starting with a Tesla employee in the front passenger seat, local regulators required the employee move to the driver's seat. But Musk also promises the service will soon have no employees behind the wheel, as well as a true self-driving “Cybercab” with no brake, accelerator or steering wheel.
    


            Tesla did not respond to CNN's request for comment. The company has insisted that its cars using self-driving technology are safer than human drivers.
    


            Safety experts, however, said that Tesla has not produced the data needed to prove that claim. And even a driver sitting behind the wheel of a car using FSD poses a risk.
    


            “There's great, great concern that humans, simply as a matter of psychology and physiology, are going to lose attention if they are doing nothing but watching, while their cars are doing everything else,” Smith said.

            Virginia Distillery CEO Gareth Moore was bullish on his company's American single malt whisky sales north of the border when 2025 kicked off.
    


            But then demand crashed as the centuries-long friendship between the United States and Canada broke down amid bruised feelings over tariffs and President Donald Trump's threat to make Canada the 51st US state.
    


            “We were looking to triple the business. Instead, it collapsed to zero,” Moore told CNN in a phone interview. “It was almost like suddenly the whisky didn't taste good because of where it's from.”
    


            Canadian officials went so far as to ban American spirits from their store shelves, a prohibition that still exists in many provinces today.
    


            Virginia Distillery is hardly the only American business caught in the middle of the rocky US-Canada relationship.
    


            “This was all about some ugliness that we're not part of,” Moore said. “We're not in politics. We're just some guys in Virginia making good whisky. But unfortunately, we're the victims.”
    


            It's not just that Canadians are refusing or unable to drink American booze due to bans. It's also that many are deciding not to visit the United States, dealing a blow to countless resorts and travel businesses that once relied on a steady stream of Canadian visitors.
    


            On a normal year, roughly 70% of the daily golfers at the Bluff Point Golf Resort in Plattsburgh, New York are Canadians. Not this year.
    


            “It's been a dramatic drop. It's very rare that we see someone pull in to play golf that's coming from Canada,” said Paul Dame, owner of Bluff Point Golf Resort, which is located just 35 minutes from downtown Montreal.
    


            Canadian visitors by land to the United States have plunged 31% so far this year through the end of September, according to the most recent data from Statistics Canada. Air travel by Canadians is down by 13%.
    


            Bluff Point Golf Resort has responded by cutting hours and staff among its housekeeping crew.
    


            “The tough thing for us is, it's nothing we've done. We've worked hard to grow our business and lure folks who want to come across the border,” Dame said. “Canadians just aren't happy. It's not economic policy. It's these hurtful things said about their country.”
    


            Mark Collins, who was born and raised in Newfoundland, Canada, said Canadians have long treasured their friendship with the United States and the fact that the US-Canada border is the longest undefended border on the planet.
    


            But earlier this year Collins, the CEO of Seattle-based ferry service Clipper Navigation, noticed a sudden drop in bookings from Canada into the United States. Ridership between Vancouver and Seattle has plunged 30% so far this year, the company said.
    


            Collins said that while the currency exchange rate is always a challenge for Canadians visiting the United States, the “straw that broke the camel's back” was Trump's threat to make Canada the 51st US state.
    


            “There is definitely a sense of national pride being offended. People said, ‘Well, if it's going to be like that, I have a choice and my choice is not to travel to the United States,'” Collins said.
    


            Hurt by a “grim” decline in cross-border bookings, Collins said his company has been forced to shrink its schedule sharply and lay off a quarter of its workforce.
    


            Ironically, those layoffs have hit Clipper Navigation's US workforce the hardest.
    


            “We're hunkering down. It doesn't look like it's getting better anytime soon,” Collins said.
    


            Executives say another factor behind the drop in Canadian visitors is concerns about the Trump administration's aggressive border enforcement.
    


            “People started feeling like it's risky to cross the border,” Collins said.
    


            Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the US Travel Association, told CNN that some foreign visitors from Canada and other countries fear they will be detained or have their devices searched when going through customs.
    


            “The perception is that travelers aren't as welcome as they once were,” Freeman said. “The most important thing the administration can do is send a message to travelers around the world that the US is open to business to legal travelers.”
    


            Freeman said the “big test” will come this winter when tourism hot spots in Texas, Florida and Arizona learn whether the Canadian visitors they're dependent on will show up.
    


            Jeff Quint, founder and CEO Cedar Ridge Distillery in Swisher, Iowa, was forced to abandon the European market during the first Trump administration due to trade tensions and retaliatory tariffs imposed on American spirits.
    


            Cedar Ridge Distillery refocused instead on Canada, shipping aggressively into Ontario and other provinces. That shift paid off –  until this year when some Canadian provinces banned American spirits.
    


            “You hate to invest in a market for two to three years – and then have to bail out of it,” Quint told CNN.
    


            Exports of American spirits to Canada plunged by 85% in the second quarter, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS).
    


            The good news is that trade threats between Ottawa and Washington have eased a bit in recent months.
    


            During an Oval Office meeting last week with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Trump joked about a “merger” of the two countries but also praised his counterpart as a “world-class leader.”
    


            Quint is hopeful that after years of turbulence, the global trade picture clears up soon.
    


            “These tariffs create a level of uncertainty that is paralyzing,” he said. “We just want to know what the rules are. This lengthy period of instability isn't good for anyone.”

            The Dutch government has taken control of Chinese-owned computer chipmaker Nexperia, ratcheting up tensions with Beijing as a global fight brews over technology intellectual property, especially around semiconductors.
    


            The government said late on Sunday that it has intervened in Dutch-headquartered Nexperia, which manufactures chips for cars and consumer electronics. It cited worries about the possible transfer of technology to Nexperia's Chinese parent company, Wingtech.
    


            Amsterdam invoked never-before-used powers under a Dutch law known as the “Availability of Goods Act.” The decision led to a 10% fall in Wingtech's shares in Shanghai Monday.
    


            The Dutch government will not take ownership of Nexperia, but it will now have the power to reverse or block management decisions it considers harmful. The company's regular production is continuing.
    


            US President Donald Trump is ratcheting up pressure on Chinese tech firms as part of a broader trade war that saw him threaten 100% tariffs on China's exports last week.
    


            The United States and the Netherlands typically cooperate closely on computer chip industry export controls. A Dutch Economic Affairs Ministry spokesperson, however, said there was no US involvement in its decision regarding Nexperia and the timing was “purely coincidental.”
    


            Washington last month expanded a list of blacklisted firms seen as threats to national security to include subsidiaries.
    


            Wingtech had already been placed on the US “entity list” in December 2024 for its alleged role “in aiding China's government's efforts to acquire entities with sensitive semiconductor manufacturing capability.”
    


            Nexperia, which is 100%-owned by Wingtech, said at the time that it would comply with the US rules, though it said its operations were kept at arm's length from its Chinese parent.
    


            Wingtech called the Dutch government's intervention in Nexperia, once part of Dutch electronics group Philips, “excessive interference driven by geopolitical bias.”
    


            Wingtech also alleged that non-Chinese Nexperia executives had tried to forcibly alter the company's equity structure through legal proceedings in a “cloaked power grab” on the company.
    


            Wingtech said in a statement that it was consulting with lawyers and seeking government support to “protect the legitimate rights and interests of the company.”
    


            Nexperia, which Wingtech bought for $3.63 billion in 2018, said it complied with all relevant laws and regulations.
    


            In its statement, the Dutch government cited issues around “crucial technological knowledge” without elaborating.
    


            “The loss of these capabilities could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security,” it said.
    


            Nexperia is one of the world's largest makers of simple computer chips such as diodes and transistors, though it also develops more advanced technologies such as “wide gap” semiconductors used in electrical settings and useful for electric cars, chargers and artificial intelligence data centers.
    


            Wingtech said in a filing to the Shanghai stock exchange Monday that its control over Nexperia would be temporarily restricted due to the Dutch order and court rulings, affecting decision-making and operational efficiency.
    


            Wingtech said its chairman Zhang Xuezheng was suspended from Nexperia's boards by an Amsterdam court order on October 6, and an independent non-Chinese person with a “deciding vote” would be appointed in his place.
    


            Wingtech has had run-ins before with other Western governments over its operations, with Britain ordering it to divest ownership of a facility in Newport.

The Boilermakers earned 35 of 61 first-place votes to top Monday's poll to begin the 2025-26 season. That put Matt Painter's squad ahead of the two teams that played in last year's NCAA title game, with runner-up Houston at No. 2 and reigning champion Florida at No. 3.

“We are obviously excited to get the season going and being ranked No. 1 in the preseason is a great indicator of what we feel this team can accomplish,” Painter said. “But the goal is to be No. 1 at the end of the year. We're thrilled that people think this highly of our team, but there is a long ways to go and a lot of work to do to reach that goal in April.”

Purdue started a year ranked as high as No. 2 once before, in 1987-88 under Gene Keady.

It's another milestone for Painter, the former Keady player who has built his own successful program that is still looking for its NCAA title breakthrough as he enters his 21st season. Purdue had never been ranked No. 1 in any AP poll before the 2021-22 season, which marked the first of three straight seasons in which the Boilermakers have reached the top. The last was during the 2023-24 season behind two-time AP national player of the year Zach Edey in a run all the way to the national title game.

The Boilermakers reached last year's Sweet 16 before falling to Houston on a last-second basket, but return a first-team AP All-American in point guard Braden Smith, scoring leader Trey Kaufman-Renn (20.1) and veteran guard Fletcher Loyer.

Kelvin Sampson's Cougars earned 16 first-place votes to match the program's best-ever preseason AP ranking after last year's finals run. The other No. 2 appearance was by the 1967-68 team led by Elvin Hayes.

Todd Golden's Gators earned eight first-place votes to start this year with their highest preseason ranking since the last time they entered a year as reigning champions in 2006-07, the start of a run to a second straight title.

UConn was next at No. 4 and earned the remaining two first-place votes. St. John's was fifth, with Rick Pitino's Red Storm surpassing the program's previous best ranking in a preseason AP poll (No. 7 in 1984-85).

Duke was next at No. 6, followed by Michigan, BYU — which landed the nation's No. 1 recruit in A.J. Dybantsa — Kentucky and Texas Tech to round out the top 10.

It hasn't taken long for Pat Kelsey to get Louisville back among the national elite, with the Cardinals checking in at No. 11 after a 27-win season to start his tenure. The Cardinals were 12-52 in the two seasons before his arrival.

Louisville is one of five programs with a second-year coach in the preseason poll, joining Michigan, BYU, Kentucky and No. 14 Arkansas with John Calipari.

Kansas checked in at No. 19, the lowest preseason rank for Bill Self's Jayhawks since starting at No. 24 in the 2008-09 season as the reigning national champion. Kansas had been ranked outside the top 10 only once since that year (No. 13 in 2011-12) while starting at No. 1 in 2019-20 as well as each of the last two seasons in that stretch. 

Auburn opens at No. 20 as it enters its first season since the unexpected retirement of coach Bruce Pearl following last year's Final Four run.

Pearl stepped aside last month after 11 seasons, triggering a transition to his 38-year-old son Steven, who climbed his father's staff through the elder Pearl's Auburn tenure but has never been a head coach nor coached elsewhere in college.

The Southeastern Conference, Big Ten and Big 12 each had six ranked teams to make up 72% of the field. The Atlantic Coast Conference and Big East were next with three each, while the West Coast Conference had one with No. 21 Gonzaga. The Big 12 was the only league of that group to have three top-10 teams.

Will Wade's arrival at N.C. State and subsequent roster shakeup has the Wolfpack as the first team outside the poll, sitting just three points behind 25th-ranked rival North Carolina from the ACC. Oregon is lurking close behind entering its 16th year under Dana Altman.

DARTMOUTH, Mass. (AP) — A small plane crashed along a major highway in southeastern Massachusetts early Monday amid rain and strong winds, killing both people on board and wounding another person on the ground, authorities said.

In videos shot by people in passing vehicles, smoke could be seen billowing above Interstate 195 from scattered, blazing debris. The highway was closed in both directions near the crash site in Dartmouth, a town about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of Boston, the state Department of Transportation said.

The Massachusetts State Police said in a statement it was not aware of any survivors on the plane, which it said may have been attempting to land at New Bedford Regional Airport. Officials said it does not appear the pilot provided the airport with a flight plan or passenger details.

A spokesperson for the National Transportation Safety Board said it was investigating the crash, saying a Socata TBM-700 had departed from the New Bedford airport.

No information about the people on board is being made public pending notification of next of kin, authorities said.

A person on the ground was taken to a hospital, state police said.

In a Facebook post, New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell extended his condolences to the loved ones of those lost in the “tragic plane crash.” New Bedford Regional Airport officials are prepared to support the National Transportation Safety Board in its investigation, Mitchell said.

“I am grateful that the crash miraculously did not result in serious injuries to motorists on Interstate 195,” he said. 




At the time of the crash, the National Weather Service said a nor'easter had brought rain and winds from 30 to 40 mph (48 to 64 kph) to the area.

The Federal Aviation Administration, which state police said would likely take over the investigation, said in an email that it could not respond to media inquiries due to the government shutdown.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — OpenAI said Monday it is working with chipmaker Broadcom to design its own artificial intelligence computer chips.

The two California companies didn't disclose the financial terms of the deal but said they will start deploying the new racks of customized “AI accelerators” late next year.

It's the latest big deal between OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, and the companies building the chips and data centers required to power AI.

OpenAI in recent weeks has announced partnerships with chipmakers Nvidia and AMD that will supply the AI startup with specialized chips for running its AI systems. OpenAI has also made big deals with Oracle, CoreWeave and other companies developing the data centers where those chips are housed.

Many of the deals rely on circular financing, in which the companies are both investing in OpenAI and supplying the world's most valuable startup with technology, fueling concerns about an AI bubble. OpenAI doesn't yet turn a profit but says its flagship chatbot now has more than 800 million weekly users. 

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the work to develop a custom chip began more than a year ago.

“Developing our own accelerators adds to the broader ecosystem of partners all building the capacity required to push the frontier of AI to provide benefits to all humanity,” he said in a statement.

Broadcom shares surged more than 9% on Monday after the morning announcement. 

Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said in a statement that “we are thrilled to co-develop and deploy 10 gigawatts of next generation accelerators and network systems to pave the way for the future of AI.”

More than 30 people were rescued and three people remain unaccounted for in western Alaska after the remnants of Typhoon Halong brought hurricane-force winds and flooding strong enough to sweep away entire homes in coastal communities, authorities said. 

Rescue aircraft were sent to the tiny Alaskan villages of Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, where there were reports of people possibly unaccounted for, said Jeremy Zidek, spokesperson for the state Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.

“We have received reports that people's homes have floated away and that people were potentially in those homes,” Zidek told The Associated Press.

In Kwigillingok, at least 18 people were rescued and three people remained unaccounted for, Alaska State Troopers said in a social media post on Sunday evening. In Kipnuk, at least 16 people were rescued and troopers had received secondhand reports of people who were unaccounted for. They were working with local officials to determine how many people were missing. Search efforts were expected to continue overnight as conditions allowed. 

In an AP interview, meteorologist Carson Jones with the National Weather Service in Anchorage, Alaska, says the remnants of a typhoon brought hurricane-force winds Sunday to some areas.

According to the nonprofit Coastal Villages Region Fund, nearly 600 people in Kipnuk were taking shelter at a school while around 300 people in Kwigillingok were sheltering in a school there. The area is among one of the most isolated in the U.S., where some communities have few roads and residents use boardwalks, boats and snowmobiles to get around, Zidek said.

“Every effort will be made to help those hit by this storm. Help is on the way,” Gov. Mike Dunleavy said in a statement.

In North Carolina's Outer Banks, an area that's seen significant storm damage this season, ocean overwash spread across Highway 12 near Buxton, the Dare County Sheriff's Office posted online Sunday. The North Carolina Department of Transportation said crews were working to clear the highway that was closed on Ocracoke and Hatteras on Sunday.




The waves were ferocious at the Hatteras Island town of Buxton, where several beachfront homes have fallen into the water in recent weeks. One house was losing its pilings Sunday and appeared close to collapsing.

On the East Coast, forecasters warned that major coastal flooding was likely Monday in the mid-Atlantic, particularly from Virginia to New Jersey, with strong onshore winds, high surf and high tides. Coastal flooding was expected to peak Monday afternoon and improve gradually into Tuesday morning, according to the National Weather Service. 

A nor'easter churned its way up the East Coast over the weekend, washing out roads and prompting air travel delays. There were 384 cancelations and 2,787 delays within, into, or out of the United States by midday Monday, with many of those disruptions affecting Boston Logan International and LaGuardia Airport in New York, according to FlightAware, a website that tracks flight disruptions.

Dangerous surf conditions were expected to continue Monday, bringing strong rip currents and beach erosion along many East Coast beaches, the weather service said. Wind gusts in excess of 55 mph (89 kph) remained possible along New Jersey, Long Island and southern New England through Monday afternoon.

The storm continued to sock coastal areas in New Jersey and New York City on Monday, with some minor to moderate flooding reported in those areas, but no major damage had occurred. The Columbus Day Parade in New York City was canceled.

The rain and winds that started late Saturday were expected to continue throughout the day before tapering off late Monday or early Tuesday. Forecasters said more than 2 inches (5 centimeters) of rain could fall in some spots. The greatest threat for major flooding was expected to be in Long Island and southern New Jersey.

New Jersey was under a state of emergency and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul issued an emergency declaration for eight southern counties, while urging people to avoid travel and monitor forecasts. 

In Delaware, emergency management officials activated the state National Guard on Sunday in response to rising floodwaters and harsh winds. A voluntary evacuation order was issued for the town of Bowers Beach, where the Murderkill River flows into Delaware Bay.

NEW YORK (AP) — Armed with hundreds of thousands of dollars from Newman's Own Foundation and Ozempic creator Novo Nordisk, young Native Americans are leading the fight against persistently high rates of food insecurity in tribal communities.

In a rare example of agency for a beneficiary community, 21 emerging Indigenous leaders recently crafted selection criteria, evaluated applicants and picked two dozen finalists to split a pool of $720,000. Organized by Native Americans in Philanthropy, the 16-to-24-year-old participants said the inclusive process reflected Indian Country values of self-determination and intergenerational relationship-building that more donors should embrace.

“Funders can listen to native youth to know where they should direct resources,” said Native Americans in Philanthropy program manager Savannah Baber, 28. 

The resulting Indigenous Tomorrows Fund was successful enough that organizers want to increase next year's pot to $1 million. Native Americans in Philanthropy — a coalition of grantmakers, tribal leaders and other advocates for increased philanthropic support of Indigenous organizations — has secured half of that funding. They are still seeking partners to commit the other $500,000.

The pilot program was fairly unusual for a grant initiative. Despite shifts towards the trust-based philanthropy championed by MacKenzie Scott and others that removes restrictions on how donations can be used, wealthy funders generally dictate the terms of their giving. It's still uncommon for the communities receiving the donations to be so directly involved behind the scenes, let alone handed the reins almost entirely. And it's especially unusual for young people to receive responsibilities beyond, say, a seat at the table or a purely “advisory” role.




More participatory approaches, however, are gaining popularity across the sector. Center for Effective Philanthropy President Phil Buchanan said there's increased sensitivity to “top-down philanthropy.” But his sense is that it's rarer for funders to cede decision-making power to others.

“There's this recognition that a lot of philanthropic mistakes are made when answers to problems other people are experiencing are cooked up by consultants in conference rooms, rather than being informed by those who donors actually seek to help,” Buchanan said.

The fund's focus on food insecurity therefore made sense to Native Americans in Philanthropy considering the issue's acute impact in Indigenous communities Settler-colonialism forced them onto unfamiliar reservations and diminished their ability to follow the traditional food practices that had sustained generations.

While rates have fallen, recent U.S. Department of Agriculture surveys suggest American Indian/Alaska Native households still lack access to adequate food at twice the level of white residents. Child obesity is high. And affordable, healthy groceries are even harder to come by in rural food deserts.

The $30,000 grant recipients are tackling those issues in a variety of ways. There's a multi-generational collective of Shinnecock women in New York who farm kelp to clean up a bay. Or an Arizona-based community center that grows culturally significant crops such as Apache giant squash, distributes fresh produce and trains youth through hands-on land management.

Philanthropy's sparse giving to Native American-led organizations means there's little private money for such efforts. Less than 0.5% of funding from large U.S. foundations goes to Native American nonprofits, according to a 2019 report by Candid and Native Americans in Philanthropy.

Native Americans in Philanthropy had already been working to reverse that trend. The group hosts a Native Youth Grantmakers program that teaches Indigenous young adults about the philanthropic sector. Newman's Own Foundation offered to take that learning a step further by giving them a shot at running an entire fund themselves.

Funders determined the issue areas of food sovereignty and health. Because Newman's Own supports child nutrition efforts broadly, Baber said the foundation wanted Indigenous youth's perspectives on advancing food justice. They brought Novo Nordisk on board with an interest in wellness.

Grantmakers proceeded independently from there. But that autonomy didn't mean they were entirely on their own. Younger philanthropy professionals, elders, NAP staff and funders' program officers sometimes joined meetings. But their presence only spurred conversation and never dominated conversation, according to younger participants.

Participants said it wasn't their accomplished resumes or community engagement that made them equipped to join the grantmaking team. It was something more innate that many titans of philanthropy don't have: the fact that they came directly from native communities.

They were heartened by their peers' interest in reclaiming land stewardship practices and ensuring access for future generations. Newman's Own Foundation Indigenous Communities Officer Jackie Blackbird said that interest was highlighted by the volume of proposals; this inaugural cycle received more than 400 applications.

Whether the projects were promoting Indigenous languages to better understand their food cultures or sustainably tending local ecosystems, grant reviewers found a constant in their peers' embrace of past cultural knowledge to solve today's problems. They felt the project allowed them to continue the legacies of their ancestors who passed down traditions with future generations top of mind.

“Indigenous youth are reconnecting to their culture and to healing more and more,” Blackbird said. “Projects like the Indigenous Tomorrows Fund help them also build that confidence and learn more about challenges in communities.”

BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) — Two fast trains collided in eastern Slovakia on Monday, injuring dozens of passengers, including two in critical condition, officials said.

The crash occurred near the town of Rožňava shortly after 10 a.m. local time (0800 GMT), the Slovak Railways said.

Slovak police said that about 80 passengers were estimated to be onboard, but didn't immediately offer more details.

Interior Minister Matúš Šutaj Eštok said two of the injured were in critical condition while the other injuries weren't serious.

Images from the collision showed the front part of one engine badly damaged, while the other train derailed.

Authorities have opened an investigation into the cause of the crash. Šutaj Eštok suggested human error might be to blame.

House Speaker Mike Johnson joins 'Fox News Sunday' to discuss the government shutdown, President Donald Trump's direction to pay U.S. troops, the battle over healthcare and more.

Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., delivered a stark warning during a Monday press conference on Day 13 of the government shutdown.

""We're barreling toward one of the longest shutdowns in American history unless Democrats drop their partisan demands and pass a clean, no-strings-attached budget to reopen the government and pay our federal workers,"" the leader of the House of Representatives said.

The government entered into a shutdown nearly two weeks ago on Oct. 1 after Senate Democrats rejected the GOP's federal funding plan. They have since blocked consideration of the same bill six more times.

During his press conference, Johnson referenced former President Barack Obama telling a crowd over a decade ago, ""There is one way out of this reckless and damaging Republican shutdown: Congress has to pass a budget that funds our government with no partisan strings attached.""

""What I just read was a direct quote. Those are not my words. They belong to President Barack Obama. He was speaking there in 2013 when our government was shut down for 16 days,"" he said. ""This would be the third-longest government shutdown in American history, that one would be.""

He added, ""If Democrats keep up their obstruction here today, that's where we're going to be headed.""

The longest shutdown in U.S. history lasted 35 days between December 2018 and January 2019, during President Donald Trump's first term.

The second-longest was a 21-day shutdown under former President Bill Clinton between December 1995 and January 1996, followed by the shutdown under Obama.

At this point, the 2025 shutdown is the fifth-longest in history, just behind the 1978 shutdown under former President Jimmy Carter.

Republicans proposed a seven-week bill extending fiscal year (FY) 2025 federal funding levels through Nov. 21 called a continuing resolution (CR). It's aimed at giving congressional negotiators more time to strike a longer-term agreement on FY2026, which began on Oct. 1.

It's largely free of policy riders — save for an added $88 million in security funding for lawmakers, the White House and the judicial branch — and it has bipartisan support.

It passed the House along mostly partisan lines on Sept. 19. But Democrats in the House and Senate were largely infuriated by being sidelined in federal funding talks and are now demanding that any spending deal also include an extension of COVID-19 pandemic-era enhanced Obamacare subsidies that are set to expire at the end of this year.

Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt joins ‘America Reports' to discuss a sting operation that uncovered more than 120 illegal immigrants driving 18-wheelers, some linked to fatal crashes.

FIRST ON FOX: A Senate Republican wants to add stricter English proficiency requirements for truck drivers after an Obama-era rule change loosened standards.

Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., plans to introduce legislation that would add more stringent English proficiency rules for commercial truck drivers and an enforcement mechanism that would deem them ""out of service"" should they not meet the proposed standards.

The bill would add several standards, including ensuring that truck drivers can converse with the public, understand highway traffic signs and signals in the English language, respond to official inquiries and make entries on reports and records.

""Wyoming families and travelers deserve safe highways,"" Lummis said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""I'm introducing this commonsense legislation to ensure commercial truck drivers operating heavy vehicles can simply read signs, understand traffic laws and communicate effectively with law enforcement and emergency responders.""

The bill also comes on the heels of President Donald Trump's executive order from earlier this year, which similarly added stricter English language requirements.

Trump's order and Lummis' bill would also require that a person driving a commercial motor vehicle who does not meet those standards will be deemed out of service, a move meant to add enforcement following a change made in 2016 under then-President Barack Obama.

'ENGLISH ISN'T OPTIONAL': SENATE GOP BILL TAKES AIM AT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TRUCKERS AFTER FLORIDA CRASH

""This legislation will correct the major mistake the Obama administration made in undermining these rules and will codify President Trump's Executive Order to make our highways safer for all Americans,"" Lummis said.

While English proficiency requirements have existed for truck drivers for decades, a 2016 memo from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration instructed inspectors to give warnings and citations to commercial vehicle drivers who did not meet the English proficiency requirements, rather than place them out of service.

Lummis' bill, which she and Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, R-Wyo., plan to introduce, also has a companion version in the House, introduced by Rep. Harriet Haggeman, R-Wyo.

There was a similar incident earlier this year when Harjinder Singh, an illegal immigrant from India, allegedly struck and killed three people in a tractor-trailer while making an illegal U-turn on a Florida highway on Aug. 12. The trailer jackknifed and collided with a minivan, killing all three of its passengers.

President Donald Trump's Cabinet broke out into applause, Oct. 9, 2025, as Trump signed a proclamation honoring Italian explorer Christopher Columbus.

A new House GOP proposal would withhold funding from U.S. jurisdictions that celebrate Indigenous Peoples Day instead of Columbus Day.

It comes after President Donald Trump signed a proclamation last week declaring Oct. 13 Columbus Day in honor of the famed explorer as well as the heritage of Italian Americans across the U.S.

""This is about every son and daughter of Italy, every Knights of Columbus, every pasta dinner on Sunday, and every communion — everything that makes our culture who we are, from Philadelphia to San Francisco,"" Rep. Michael Rulli, R-Ohio, told Fox News Digital in an interview.

""Every Little Italy neighborhood of this country celebrates Christopher Columbus. It's so much more than the man. It's the people.""

CABINET SPONTANEOUSLY APPLAUDS AS TRUMP SIGNS COLUMBUS DAY PROCLAMATION: 'WE'RE BACK, ITALIANS'

Rulli's new bill would both reaffirm Columbus Day as a federal holiday and punish cities and states that replaced the celebration of it with Indigenous Peoples Day.

""We are not going to allow any American municipality to think that they have power over the federal government,"" he said.

In 2021, then-President Joe Biden formally recognized the second Monday in October as both Columbus Day and Indigenous Peoples Day.

The move was lauded by progressive activists and historians who saw Christopher Columbus as the harbinger of a genocide against the land's indigenous people, millions of whom were killed amid American colonization.

But Rulli argued that Columbus Day was about honoring Italian Americans' heritage, pointing out that part of the motivation for its founding in 1892 was the extrajudicial lynching of 11 Italian Americans in New Orleans after the death of a local police chief.

He added his legislation was not meant to undercut the significance of Native Americans — whom he said deserve their own day of significance.

""I mean, the Native Americans are some of the most amazing, dynamic cultural people that make up the fabric of America. But they need their own special day,"" Rulli said. ""And I would be willing to do that. I'm saying right now, I would be willing to get the indigenous people their own day, but not this day.""

He further accused the Biden administration of undercutting the legacy of both peoples by declaring both holidays on the same day, while praising Trump for restoring Columbus Day's original meaning.

""I don't care what party you're in … if you come from Italian American descent, you love what President Trump did. It was a wonderful olive branch to all Italian Americans,"" Rulli said.

""By no means, no way, shape or form, is this bill meant to offend any of the indigenous people. They deserve their own day. We will get them their own day, but not Columbus Day. This has already been embedded in our fabric for 130 years,"" he said.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised President Donald Trump as the ""greatest friend"" Israel has ever had on Monday as Hamas released the 20 living remaining hostages.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will not attend Monday's peace conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, where President Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi will host more than 20 world leaders in a bid to cement an end to the war in Gaza.

Netanyahu's office said the prime minister was ""unable to attend due to time constraints ahead of the start of the holiday."" October 13–15 marks Shemini Atzeret, followed by Simchat Torah on October 15.

Leader of Israel's left-wing Democrats, Yair Golan, condemned the decision.

""I am appalled by Prime Minister Netanyahu's decision to skip this historic event orchestrated by President Trump. Let it be clear: Netanyahu's refusal to attend the peace summit in Egypt is driven purely by narrow political interests,"" he said in a statement to Fox News.

""After two years of Israel's most difficult war, we can not afford a leader guided by his personal interest.""

WHITE HOUSE TURNS TO EXPANDING ABRAHAM ACCORDS AFTER ISRAEL-HAMAS CEASEFIRE

The summit, set in the Red Sea resort town, is expected to draw leaders from Turkey, Jordan, Britain, Germany, France, Italy, and top representatives from the United Nations and the European Union. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas is also slated to attend as regional powers press for a role in stabilizing postwar Gaza.

The conference comes amid a renewed push by the Trump administration to expand the Abraham Accords framework once the conflict in Gaza is resolved. Four nations joined the normalization agreements with Israel during Trump's first term, and senior White House officials have signaled optimism that additional Arab and Muslim-majority countries could follow.

NETANYAHU CALLS TRUMP ISRAEL'S 'GREATEST FRIEND' AS FINAL LIVING HOSTAGES RELEASED

Adding to that momentum, Israeli media reported Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto—the leader of the world's largest Muslim-majority nation—was expected to visit Israel on Tuesday, raising speculation that Indonesia could be next to pursue an Abraham Accords-style peace and normalization agreement with Jerusalem. But Indonesian Foreign Minister Sugiono told Indonesian media ""no such plan"" is in place for a visit.

Subianto surprised observers with unusually warm remarks toward Israel during his address to the United Nations General Assembly last month, closing his speech with the Hebrew word ""Shalom.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Letitia James handled mortgage and bank fraud cases similar to the one she now faces","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice/3846093/letitia-james-handled-mortgage-and-bank-fraud-cases/","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

New York Attorney General Letitia James, long known for targeting mortgage and bank fraud, now finds herself accused of the very type of deception she once prosecuted.

James, who built her career in part by exposing forged deeds and false loan applications in state court, was indicted Thursday by a federal grand jury in Virginia on one count each of bank fraud and making false statements to financial institutions. The indictment alleges that James misrepresented her Virginia home as her “principal residence” to obtain favorable mortgage terms — a misstatement prosecutors say saved her roughly $18,933 of “ill-gotten gains” over the life of the loan.

Over the past six years, James's office has charged numerous defendants with falsifying documents to obtain mortgages and mislead banks. In one June 2019 Brooklyn case, prosecutors accused a couple of submitting fake pay stubs, tax returns, and bank statements to secure multiple loans. A July 2021 Harlem and Long Island case charged developer Joseph Makhani with forging deeds and falsifying records to get bank financing for properties he didn't own outright. And in a Queens case this year, the first under New York's new deed-theft statute, her office accused two men of using forged property transfers to obtain a $552,500 mortgage.

All those cases revolved around a familiar theme: lying or misleading lenders for personal gain. Now, James faces the same kind of allegation in the indictment brought against her.

Former Republican Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, now CEO of the 1792 Exchange, said the parallels are striking. 

“It appears from what I've seen of the indictment that there were misrepresentations related to the application and securing of the loan,” Cameron told the Washington Examiner. “It appears pretty cut and dry. The check on all of this is that a grand jury — seated in Virginia, not exactly a hotbed of conservatism — found probable cause to indict.”

Cameron added that claims of political targeting overlook a basic point, which is that James's own office has prosecuted nearly identical cases. 

“Despite what Letitia James and her people are saying, it's not an uncommon set of facts,” he said. “The best case in point is that in her own office, they've pursued indictments and prosecutions with similar fact patterns. The idea that this is just weaponization doesn't square with reality.”

According to the indictment, James took out a $109,600 mortgage in August 2020 to buy a small house in Norfolk, Virginia, with the loan terms requiring that it be used as a secondary residence — not as a rental or investment property. Prosecutors say she never used the property herself and instead rented it out, benefiting from a lower interest rate and higher seller credit that would not have been available for an investment loan.

The indictment, signed by U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, accuses James of committing “intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust.” Halligan, a former personal lawyer to President Donald Trump, was appointed in the Eastern District of Virginia after Trump fired U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert, who reportedly refused to bring charges against James based on the available evidence.

If convicted, James faces a maximum of 30 years in prison on each count and a fine of up to $1 million — penalties heightened by Congress during the 1990s savings and loan crisis. Still, the dollar amount at issue is small, and experts note that federal prosecutors almost never pursue mortgage-fraud cases under $500,000. Only 38 people nationwide were sentenced for federal mortgage fraud last year, most involving large-scale schemes and sums.

James's attorney Abbe Lowell has called the charges “baseless” and politically driven, saying they reflect the president's “desire for revenge.” He emphasized that James continues to pay the mortgage and said the home was occupied by family members, not tenants.

The case against James in some ways mirrors, albeit at a smaller scale, the civil fraud case she brought against Trump, his family, and the Trump Organization. James accused Trump of inflating his assets to secure favorable financing and insurance terms. That case initially resulted in a half-billion-dollar penalty before a New York appellate court rolled most of it back earlier this year.

Where Trump was accused of exaggerating the value of skyscrapers and golf courses, James is now accused of overstating her own occupancy to obtain better mortgage rates — a small-scale version of the same legal theory.

After New York Supreme Court Judge Arthur Engoron ruled in favor of James's civil case against Trump in February last year, James announced that Trump is “finally facing accountability for his lying, cheating, and staggering fraud. Because no matter how big, rich, or powerful you think you are, no one is above the law.” In August, an intermediate-level state court tossed out the full fine against Trump, though it maintained Engoron's finding that the company likely overvalued its assets. James is now appealing that decision.

Halligan issued a brief yet similar comment on Thursday in response to the indictment, saying that “no one is above the law.”

The indictment against James comes just as similar political and constitutional issues play out in another case led by the same prosecutor, Halligan. At the arraignment of former FBI Director James Comey last week, Comey's lawyer told the court he intends to file motions to dismiss that case on two grounds: that Halligan was unlawfully appointed and that her prosecution was vindictive and selective in violation of the Constitution.

James's defense team has not yet said whether it will take the same approach. But her attorney Lowell suggested such motions could be forthcoming, vowing to “fight these charges in every process allowed in the law” and warning that “this case is driven by President Trump's desire for revenge.”

Cameron said that while selective-prosecution claims are often raised in politically charged cases, they seldom succeed. 

“The Supreme Court has set a high bar when it comes to claims of vindictive or selective prosecution,” he said. “At the end of the day, the grand jury process itself serves as a check. You still have to present credible facts, and they did. That's what gives this case legal standing.”

If Lowell pursues a dismissal motion, it will likely hinge on the same arguments surfacing in the Comey case: that Halligan, a Trump ally with no prior experience as a leading prosecutor, improperly weaponized her office against the president's adversaries. Comey's attorneys are also seeking to challenge the legality of Halligan's appointment.

Previous attempts to link James to financial irregularities have largely fallen apart under scrutiny, though this indictment hinges on previously undisputed facts.

Earlier this year, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, a close Trump ally, conducted his own review of real estate filings involving political opponents of the president. In April, he referred James to the Justice Department over what he claimed were false statements tied to two different properties, including a different house in Norfolk purchased with her niece in 2023. Pulte alleged that James listed herself as the primary resident on the loan paperwork for that home despite not living there.

Within weeks, James's attorney Lowell issued a detailed rebuttal, accusing Pulte of selectively highlighting one document while ignoring others that clearly named the niece as the intended occupant. Lowell, who also represented Hunter Biden during his federal firearms violation and tax evasion cases, said the referral “collapsed under basic fact-checking” once the full transaction file was reviewed.

Federal prosecutors declined to act on Pulte's referral for that property. The 2020 Norfolk property now at the center of the indictment was not part of that earlier dispute and had not been raised in Lowell's written defense.

NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL LETITIA JAMES INDICTED ON BANK FRAUD CHARGE

Nonetheless, the current indictment introduces one new piece of evidence: a homeowner's insurance application that allegedly identified the 2020 house as “owner-occupied” instead of a rental. Prosecutors say the discrepancy further supports their claim that James knowingly misled the lender about how the property would be used.

James is scheduled to appear in federal court in Norfolk on Oct. 24. If the case proceeds, jurors will have to decide whether the Empire State's most prominent fraud prosecutor made the kind of misrepresentation she once condemned in others.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

All 20 remaining living hostages have been released after being held captive by Hamas for over two years, and they are now reportedly safe with Israel Defense Forces troops in Gaza.

Seven hostages were released in the first transfer on Monday morning, shortly before President Donald Trump arrived in Tel Aviv, Israel. The final 13 remaining hostages released were Elkana Bohbot, Rom Braslavski, Nimrod Cohen, Ariel Cunio, David Cunio, Evyatar David, Maxim Herkin, Eitan Horn, Segev Kalfon, Bar Kupershtein, Yosef-Chaim Ohana, Avinatan Or, and Matan Zangauker.

WHO ARE THE FREED HOSTAGES?

The IDF confirmed the release on early Monday between 11 a.m. and 12 p.m. local time, according to reports. The hostages were handed over to the Red Cross before being transferred to the Israeli military, to be brought to the Re'im base in southern Israel.

“Matan, you're coming home!” one hostage's mother said when speaking on the phone with her son Matan Zangauker after the first transfer. “The war is over! I love you, I'm waiting for you. Thank God, the war is over!”

Thousands flooded to Tel Aviv's Hostages Square, where a livestream of the hostages was carried out. The square has been a site for protests since Oct. 7, 2023. On Monday, thousands celebrated the release of the final living hostages taken during Hamas's attack more than two years ago.

World leaders celebrated the exchange as well. 

“I share in the joy of the families and the joy of the people of Israel, following the recent transfer of seven of the hostages into the hands of the Red Cross. We only recently met with their parents,” French President Emmanuel Macron said after the initial release of seven hostages. “Their release, alongside the expected release this morning of 13 additional hostages, brings with it renewed hope for peace — for Israel, for Gaza, and for the entire region. France will take part in all stages of the plan led by the president of the United States, Donald Trump, alongside the Arab partners that France has rallied for this endeavor. But for now — let the joy fill the heart.”

Palestinian prisoners were also returned on Monday morning. Buses with the prisoners arrived in Ramallah in the West Bank to supporters carrying Palestinian flags.

Meanwhile, upon his arrival, Trump received an enthusiastic greeting from Israelis. A billboard expressed gratitude to the president for his efforts in negotiating the hostage release and ceasefire deal. Others were seen cheering on a video posted to social media: “Thank you, Trump!” 

Trump said, “The love in the streets has just been incredible,” after arriving at the Knesset, Israel's parliamentary building. “It's just been a great day.”

The president also celebrated the release of all the hostages and acknowledged their courage and bravery during their captivity.

“We're so happy for them,” Trump said. “They're going to be happy, and they're going to have a great life.”

“They've been very brave,” he added.

Trump brought with him many U.S. officials who were part of the peacemaking process, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, special envoy Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump suggested on Sunday that he may give Russian President Vladimir Putin an ultimatum of either facing Tomahawk missiles from Ukraine or stopping the fighting in the over three-year war.

Trump made the comment aboard Air Force One while on his way to Israel, a trip that comes after securing a long-sought peace deal in the Gaza war.

“I might have to speak to Russia, to be honest with you, about Tomahawks. Do they want to have Tomahawks going in their direction? I don't think so,” the U.S. president said. “I might say [to Putin], ‘Look, if this war is not gonna get settled, I may send them Tomahawks.'”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been urging Trump to supply his country with the American-made long-range missiles to get peace negotiations back on track.

While Trump has been focused on the Middle East over the past week as a ceasefire deal was struck between Israel and Hamas, he has still held calls with Zelensky, including on Sunday.

Zelensky called that discussion “very productive,” as the two leaders discussed “strengthening” Ukraine's “long-range capabilities.”

ZELENSKY URGES ‘NO WEAKENING OF PRESSURE' AS RUSSIA STRIKES UKRAINIAN ENERGY PLANTS

As Trump gives his latest indication he is willing to provide Ukraine with the missiles, Russia has warned against the prospect, with the Kremlin saying “the topic of Tomahawks is of extreme concern.”

In recent weeks, Russia has been battering Ukraine's energy sector, launching large-scale aerial attacks on energy plants. Zelensky said in a video address on Sunday that these strikes are evidence that Russia is losing on the battlefield, pointing to advancements by his troops in Orikhiv, located in southern Ukraine.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Hamas released the last 20 living hostages from Gaza to Israel on Monday, over two years after the war broke out in response to the terrorist group's Oct. 7 attack on the Jewish state.

As the remaining hostages, all men under 50 years old, were transported back to their native country, their families greeted them upon their long-overdue return.

ALL LIVING ISRAELI HOSTAGES OFFICIALLY FREED FROM HAMAS CAPTIVITY 

The hostage release was part of the Israel-Hamas peace deal that President Donald Trump announced last week. Israel agreed to release roughly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and withdraw from parts of Gaza to a certain line in exchange for the remaining captives.

The bodies of 28 hostages are also expected to be returned, although only four will be handed over on Monday. The Hostage and Missing Families Forum called this a “blatant breach” of Hamas's agreement with Israel.

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) denied the Democratic Party is holding federal workers hostage during the government shutdown, saying past comments he made opposing this tactic were on a “long-term” healthcare issue.

The government is 12 days into a shutdown as of Sunday, and Senate Republicans need five more Democratic votes to reopen the government. Murphy, who has voted against all of the Republican bills to reopen the government, previously spoke against lawmakers trying to “use” the nation's security and federal workers as “hostages” during negotiations to end a 2018 government shutdown.

CBS News's Margaret Brennan confronted Murphy about those past comments on Sunday, asking if he is now doing “exactly” what he criticized in 2018. The senator said no, and that his past comments were referring to “the long-term structure” of the healthcare system. This current shutdown, he argued, is an “emergency.”

“In about a month, premiums are going to go up by 75%, and we have to make a decision whether this budget is going to allow for that to happen or to stop it. What is happening in Chicago right now is an emergency. What is happening at the FCC as they try to shut down free speech in this country is an emergency,” Murphy said on Face the Nation.

“So we have a responsibility in this upcoming budget to prevent disaster for families whose premiums are about to go up, and to address the destruction of our democracy and the rule of law that's happening all over this country,” he added.

Murphy also said he doesn't believe that any follow-up discussions on healthcare will be held if the government is reopened. Brennan argued that Vice President JD Vance said it is as if Democrats will not say “what it is they want to negotiate,” though Murphy claimed “you cannot trust this administration.” 

Murphy also downplayed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's (D-NY) comments when he said every day the shutdown continues it “gets better” for Democrats. Murphy claimed people are “desperately trying to spin what Democrats are saying” after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) condemned Schumer's statement.

TRUMP MASS LAYOFFS SHOW HE ISN'T BLUFFING ON SHUTDOWN THREATS

Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA), who has voted to reopen the government, reiterated his position on Fox News's Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo that the government should always be open. He also said it's “silly” the government is shut down, while a peace deal takes effect in Gaza.

EXCLUSIVE — Devin Talbott, founder of the Maryland-based investment firm Enlightenment Capital and chairman of voting machine giant Hart InterCivic, is under scrutiny for his extensive political donations to Democratic candidates while leading a major U.S. election technology company, a combination raising questions about potential conflicts of interest in the U.S. voting system.

Talbott's firm invests heavily in the aerospace, defense, government, and technology sectors. As chairman of Hart InterCivic, he also plays a central role in shaping the company's operations and the voting systems it supplies to states nationwide.

At the same time, he has contributed more than $100,000 to Democratic candidates, committees, and PACs over the past decade while overseeing one of the country's leading voting technology suppliers.

Federal Election Commission records show Talbott has given tens of thousands of dollars to campaigns for Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and Jon Tester, while also donating to the Democratic National Committee and the anti-Trump Lincoln Project. His only recorded contribution to a Republican was a $520 donation to Nikki Haley's 2024 presidential campaign. 

Talbott is the son of Strobe Talbott, who served as deputy secretary of state under President Bill Clinton after holding senior roles focused on the former Soviet republics. He went on to lead the Brookings Institution, one of Washington's most influential think tanks, from 2002 to 2017. During his tenure, Brookings employed Igor Danchenko, who worked with former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele and was identified as a key source for the Steele dossier about alleged links between President Donald Trump and Russia. Those connections have led some critics to argue that Devin Talbott's political and business roles fit within a broader Democratic establishment network.

Public records show Talbott registered as a Democrat in Maryland in 2006 and has voted in most general elections since, underscoring his long-standing political ties as his company plays a growing role in state election systems.

Talbott's dual role as a political donor and chairman of a voting technology firm has drawn scrutiny from some election oversight advocates. 

“When the person overseeing voting systems across the country is also a six-figure donor to one political party, it undermines public confidence in the neutrality of our elections,” said one advocate familiar with Hart InterCivic's contracts, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the situation candidly.

Hart InterCivic, based in Austin, Texas, produces the Verity voting platform used in hundreds of jurisdictions across 20 states. The company is considered one of the “big three” election technology vendors in the United States, alongside Election Systems & Software and Dominion Voting Systems, which recently was purchased by a new firm called Liberty Vote.

Dominion became a flashpoint in the aftermath of the 2020 election, when false claims about its software and alleged ties to foreign actors fueled widespread conspiracy theories. After years of litigation, Dominion secured massive settlements, $787.5 million from Fox News and $67 million from Newsmax, tied to those baseless allegations. The company has maintained its systems are secure and reliable. 

By comparison, Hart InterCivic has largely avoided the national spotlight, though it has faced its own share of technical controversies. In 2018, the Texas secretary of state issued a statewide advisory after reports that Hart's eSlate voting machines were changing voters' straight-ticket selections or omitting certain races altogether during early voting. State corporate filings in Texas list Talbott as Hart InterCivic's chairman and director.

Hart's ownership has faced similar scrutiny before. In 2011, Miami-based private equity firm H.I.G. Capital, founded by former Bain & Co. and Blackstone Group executives, made what it described as a “strategic investment” in Hart. The following year, several H.I.G. principals, including managing director and Hart board member Jeff Bohl, were revealed to be major donors to Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. At the time, Hart denied “any suggestions that the company might try to influence the outcome of election results.”

In response to questions about the company's ownership and independence, a spokesperson for Hart InterCivic said the firm “is an impartial and independent U.S. technology company with more than 100 years of experience providing election solutions.” The spokesperson added that Hart's systems “are consistently certified at the federal and state levels as reliable, secure, and accurate,” and noted that the company is the only election-system provider in the nation certified to the latest federal standards, known as the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines 2.0.

Hart's Verity Vanguard system became the first in the country to earn VVSG 2.0 certification from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission in July 2025, a milestone the company said marks “a significant advancement in secure, transparent, and accessible election technology.” The company also said its systems comply with directives outlined in Trump's March 2025 executive order on preserving the integrity of American elections.

The company said Enlightenment Capital is one of several investors in Hart and that day-to-day operations and product development are handled by a professional management team. They also noted that Hart executives are prohibited from making political donations, adding that the company's technology undergoes extensive testing by independent laboratories before being certified by the Election Assistance Commission and individual states. The commission, chaired by a Trump-nominated official who has served since 2019, oversees certification for voting systems nationwide. Hart officials emphasized that certification and oversight are conducted independently of any company ownership.

Before entering the election-technology industry, Talbott built his career investing in companies that serve the defense and government sectors. He launched Enlightenment Capital in 2012 and has backed firms involved in cybersecurity, intelligence, and aviation logistics. The firm's advisory board has included retired military and national security officials, giving it deep reach into federal contracting circles. Enlightenment Capital's 2020 acquisition of Hart InterCivic positioned Talbott at the intersection of political finance, government contracting, and election administration during a period of deep public skepticism about voting systems.

TRUMP PROMISES EXECUTIVE ORDER TO ‘GET RID OF' MAIL-IN BALLOTS AND VOTING MACHINES 

Election policy analysts say Talbott's case highlights a broader gap: private vendors that supply voting systems are not required to disclose the political activities or affiliations of their owners and executives.

“There's nothing illegal about a partisan donor owning or having a stake in a voting-machine company,” one nonprofit policy adviser said, “but it's a dangerous precedent in an era when trust in elections is already fragile.” ","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The release of the remaining October 7 captives shows that hope can survive even in the darkest hole.

In Eli Sharabi's first hours of freedom earlier this year, a social worker led him to a room stocked with shampoo, toothpaste, and soap. In Gaza's tunnels, he had gone months without bathing; now he could scrub off the grime of captivity. He had sustained himself through his 491 days as a hostage by picturing the moment when he would rush into the arms of his wife and daughters. But the tunnels had sealed him off from the world. Standing in daylight, he learned that Hamas had murdered his loved ones in their home's safe room on October 7. The social worker hovered as he showered and changed, to protect Sharabi from himself.

Today, the last of the living Israeli hostages were liberated after more than two years—and their release has liberated the Israeli psyche from its fretful obsession with their fate. Having invested themselves so deeply in the hostages' story, Israelis greeted the moment as an ecstatic conclusion that helps justify the terrible toll of their nation's longest war.

The hostages' release is, indeed, an epochal moment, one that may not end the war in Gaza but will certainly redirect its course. I, however, find myself thinking more about the intimate details of what the hostages have experienced. I filter the possibilities not just through Sharabi's recollections, which ultimately tell a story of extreme perseverance, but also through what I know about my own grandfather, who escaped death during the Holocaust by hiding in barns and forests. Although he tasted the sweet fruits of survival—marriage, children, a new life on a new continent—his mind always doubled back to what he lost. The Nazis murdered his first wife and daughter. Survival was torment, and he ultimately lost the will to live. He killed himself in the grocery store that he owned in Washington, D.C.

How does a human being survive two years of torment? And how do they make sense of their life once they resume? Within months of his release, Eli Sharabi summoned the courage to ask these questions of himself in a short book, Hostage. The manager of a kibbutz roughly two miles from Gaza, Sharabi was dragged from his home, away from his English-born wife and his daughters, ages 16 and 13. “A sea of people who start thumping my head, screaming, trying to rip me limb from limb,” he remembers.

Arriving in Gaza, his captors first confined him to a home belonging to a family, where children did homework and women cooked as Hamas operatives watched over him and a Thai worker, also kidnapped on October 7. During this initial chapter, they were fed well and sometimes even able to feel the Mediterranean breeze through an open window.

What he feared most was the prospect of being hauled underground—a fate described by Gilad Shalit, a hostage seized by Hamas in a cross-border raid in 2006 and depicted by Israeli television with enough detail to implant nightmares. In the network of passageways, rigged with booby traps, there was no hope of rescue or escape. “Please, God, not a tunnel,” Sharabi kept praying.

On the 52nd day of his captivity, his captors led him into a mosque, opened a trap door, and ordered him to begin climbing down a ladder. For the first and only time in Gaza, Sharabi contemplated suicide. “There's always a choice,” he told himself. “There. Is. Always. A. Choice.”

The tunnels felt boiling hot, and Sharabi stripped to his underwear to cool himself before his guards wrapped shackles around his ankles. Eventually, they led him to a makeshift prison cell, which he shared with three other hostages. At first, his captors fed him twice a day. But as the war progressed, that dwindled, sometimes to a moldy pita or biscuits, while he could smell the meals that they cooked for themselves. Malnutrition weakened him. He had spells of dizziness and his belly caved inward.

When he needed to use a toilet, he would ask for permission. But Hamas minders would make him wait for as long as an hour. The toilet itself brimmed with sewage, a stench that permeated his room and never dissipated. Eventually, the bathroom and then his room itself were crawling with worms, which inhabited his toothbrush. For one stretch of captivity, he went eight months without seeing the light of the sun.

To taunt the hostages, captors would loudly play video clips of October 7 on their iPads, and the noises would echo down the corridors into their room. The captors would tell them, You've been abandoned by your government. He couldn't have known it, but that accusation carried a whiff of plausibility. Members of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet sometimes described hostages' families, advocating fervently for a deal to release them, with disdain. At a Knesset committee meeting, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich told the families, “We hear you too much,” before ordering guards to clear them from the room. For the settler-led faction within the government, the release of the hostages wasn't the ultimate war aim. They were a distraction from the goal of resettling Gaza, of reclaiming biblical Israel.

Yair Rosenberg: Trump's plan to finally end the Gaza war

But those fantasies have been foiled, at least for the time being. The hostage deal that the Israeli right worked to undermine has happened. And after the liberated cleanse themselves, as Sharabi did, they will sit for their first television interviews and recount the rituals that allowed them to persist.

Sharabi has described being thrown into a makeshift cell with other hostages, including a young man named Hersh Goldberg-Polin. The unavoidable fact about him was that he had lost his arm on October 7, and his fellow hostages couldn't stop staring at the remaining nub. Conversation soon turned to the very subject of life itself. Hersh quoted something he'd learned from the writings of the Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl: “He who has a why”—a purpose for living—“can bear any how.”

Unlike Sharabi, some of the hostages had already surmised that they had lost their families in the massacre, shattering the most compelling why of them all. Yet that didn't diminish their will to live. Despite being secular, they found solace in listening to an observant hostage, the son of a rabbinical scholar, recite the Jewish grace after meals. Like Odysseus, they trained their minds to relentlessly focus on home. “There is no more regular Eli,” Sharabi told himself in his first days in Gaza. “From now on, I am Eli the survivor.”

That he clung to optimism in the face of despair wasn't inevitable. As my grandfather's biography suggests, there are other outcomes. So it's worth celebrating these examples of existential heroism when they are in full view.

This weekend, on the cusp of the release of the last 20 living hostages in Gaza, Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner stood in the plaza in front of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, dubbed Hostages Square, to address a jubilant throng. He called the hostages' release the end of a nightmare. In reality, the nightmare never ends; trauma that endures for generations is the surest outcome of this war. But we also know that the hostages are going home, living proof that hope can persist even in the darkest hole.

Seven years ago, I took a bet with Charles Murray about whether we'd basically understand the genetics of intelligence by now.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Seven years ago, I took a bet from one of the most controversial figures in the scientific world. Charles Murray, the political scientist who—along with the late psychologist Richard Herrnstein—wrote The Bell Curve in 1994, wagered that one of his core ideas about genetics and intelligence would be proved true by 2025. He emailed me some time after I'd helped stoke an online furor about his insistent defense of The Bell Curve's main points, which he'd recently reiterated on a popular podcast and which I, along with two other psychologists and intelligence researchers, had denounced in Vox. I took the bet because I was confident I would win.



In The Bell Curve, Murray and Herrnstein argue that intelligence, as measured by an IQ score, is a crucial determinant of success in modern society. They also argue that a person's intelligence is substantially determined by genetics, leading to the establishment of “cognitive elites” as intelligent people select one another for reproduction. Most controversially, Herrnstein and Murray entertain the possibility that socioeconomic and educational differences among racial groups could be explained by differences in their IQ scores, and that these differences are at least partially attributable to genetic differences among the groups.



The bet's premise was simple enough. Murray quoted himself on the podcast, arguing that “we will understand IQ genetically. I think most of the picture will have been filled in by 2025—there will still be blanks, but we'll know basically what's going on.” And he proposed that, in seven years, he'd sit through a lecture I gave on the topic: “Who Was More Right?”



It is now 2025, and I am here to declare that I was more right. (This article can sub in for the lecture Murray proposed.) We do not understand the genetic or brain mechanisms that cause some people to be more intelligent than others. The more we have learned about the specifics of DNA associated with intelligence, the further away that goal has receded. Even given a softer goal of predicting, rather than explaining, intelligence differences, we still can't do it very well. If anything, we are further away now than in 2018 to knowing “basically what's going on” with genetic influences on intelligence. (When I reached out to Murray for his view on this, he insisted that he is still right. “Of course I think I won the bet, and I will lay out my reasons for thinking that,” he wrote in an email. He told me he plans to do so in a few months, when he has more time.)



When The Bell Curve was released, scientists' best understanding of how genetics influenced human behavior was based on differences and similarities among family members, especially twins. It had been established that identical twins are quite a bit more similar in their IQ than fraternal twins and that intelligence differences are heritable in a limited statistical sense. But heritable does not mean “inherited.” This statistical measure of heritability is notoriously difficult to interpret and limited in its import; twin studies, developed decades before the DNA molecule was discovered, also offered little insight into the biology of any particular trait. Herrnstein and Murray, however, took these findings as a strong indicator of genetic transmission of intelligence from parents to children.



A decade after The Bell Curve's publication, the Human Genome Project made human DNA available to scientists on a large scale, and researchers anticipated that they would figure out what was going on with genes and human behavior. But all of the most direct methods of searching for IQ genes were unsuccessful. Reports of individual genes that were purported to cause IQ differences (or personality traits or mental illness) failed to replicate over and over again. Although we have known for a long time about genes that cause profound mental disabilities, such as Tay-Sachs disease and Huntington's disease, no single gene is known to increase intelligence.



Scientists were still hopeful that, by looking at the smaller building blocks of individual genes, they might find a clear genetic map of human behaviors. Murray's proposed bet came at just about the peak of intrigue around a technology called “genome-wide association studies,” which promised to offer those insights. The technology scans the entire genome for single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs—the spots where one person's genome might have a T, while another's has a C—for associations with human behaviors. As the costs of these analyses went down and sample sizes went up, researchers identified many tiny but statistically significant associations between these small genetic variations and intelligence. The total effect of those associations was slowly inching upward, and many scientists hoped to soon be able to make meaningful predictions of IQ based on DNA.



But this line of research, too, has turned out to be far less revelatory than anticipated. The cumulative effect of the associations between SNPs and intelligence has leveled off, and correlations remain only that. The resulting estimates of heritability are only about a third of those based on twin studies. Even taken together, the associations don't add up to anything resembling a neurogenetic explanation of IQ differences.



In fact, the more researchers have learned about associations between DNA and IQ, the more complex and less deterministic this relationship looks. Some associations between SNPs and intelligence are not the direct result of DNA. (For example, if rich people send their kids to fancy schools to increase their IQ and some SNPs are associated with being rich for whatever reason, those SNPs wind up being associated with IQ as well.) Studies that compare genetic variation between pairs of siblings have been able to better control for socioeconomic backgrounds, as well as parenting practices and ethnicities; in these studies, the direct effects of DNA on IQ look even smaller, still with no hint of a biological mechanism.



That is where things stand today. Scientists might disagree about what we are going to learn in the future and when we are going to learn it, but in 2025, we do not remotely understand what Murray hoped we would.



In our email exchange, Murray said that any argument I'd lay out here would be insufficient to make this case. “We're not talking about something that lends itself to 1,500 words, or 3,000 for that matter, written for a lay audience, but a 20-page (at least) technical presentation,” he wrote. (He did not respond to an invitation to elaborate on this, or respond to the argument made in this piece.) Certainly, one could tease out in more detail the work that has been done to identify associations between SNPs and intelligence, the significance of those findings, and their limits. But to argue that any of this research adds up to a substantial account of intelligence misunderstands the nature of such human traits and what can be expected from scientific explanations of them.



Consider another human difference: financial solvency, which can be measured and quantified, just like IQ. It is heritable in twin studies and (less so) in SNPs. But would you bet that sooner or later we are going to know “what's going on” with your bank account at the level of genes? I think most people would accept that financial well-being is modestly correlated with genetic differences but also both highly malleable and responsive to a person's environment. So is IQ.

Murray wants more. He is forever repeating the prediction that we are on the threshold of a settled genetic explanation of intelligence differences because, without one, IQ cannot play the deterministic role The Bell Curve requires.

Can I prove that scientists will never discover the genetic recipe for intelligence? Of course not. That's why the terms of the bet mattered: They took an unanswerable question about what might be discovered on some indefinite timescale and made it real. The world would be a different place if scientists understood intelligence at the genetic level. But right now, like wealth and health, IQ remains a node in the uncontrolled matrix of human development, causing some things and being caused by others, as genes and environment interact in the background.

Especially if you have kids

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

One day recently, my son had two long, back-to-back doctor appointments, which meant he was in the car and in waiting rooms for much of the afternoon. His lunch and snack would not have earned me a healthy-mom award: peanut-butter puffs, a grape-jelly Uncrustables sandwich, and a package of mixed-berry oat bites. All ultra-processed foods, the new boogeyman of public health.

I have many years of experience as a health reporter, and I understand the importance of healthy eating. I'm well aware of the fervent push by both right- and left-leaning health authorities to get Americans to eat fewer ultra-processed foods. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents limit their kids' consumption of ultra-processed foods, including “anything in a crinkly bag”—that is, everything my son ate that day. Removing ultra-processed foods from Americans' diets has also become a central plank of the MAHA movement, led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who blames them for “driving the obesity epidemic.” On the podcast from Levels, the glucose-monitoring company co-founded by President Donald Trump's surgeon-general nominee, Casey Means, one expert suggested that ultra-processed foods should be in a back section of the supermarket, covered in warnings about their dangers. On the internet, crunchy moms of seemingly all political stripes post recipes for homemade goldfish crackers, for example, or hand-sculpted chicken nuggets. TikTok influencers show off the unprocessed steamed cauliflower and carrot salad that they've prepared for their toddlers. (Suspiciously missing are images of the toddlers actually eating this food.)

Nevertheless, like many working parents, I find that feeding my family a diet free of ultra-processed foods is impossible. After a long day of fighting with my 18-month-old over whether he can touch the trash (no), and whether he can eat the trash (also no), sometimes all I can do is throw some (ultra-processed) mac and cheese at him and drown my own sorrows in some Trader Joe's white queso dip (also ultra-processed). The efforts to get parents to give up these types of comforts in favor of home-roasted vegetables are frustrating—and unrealistic.

It's true that ultra-processed foods—which tend to be defined by the fact that they contain artificial ingredients and require several industrial steps to create—are, on the whole, not as good for you as unprocessed foods. Diets high in ultra-processed foods are correlated with a much greater risk of mortality. A recent study of 55 overweight people found that a diet of minimally processed foods, such as chicken and vegetables, led to twice as much weight loss as one consisting of healthy-ish ultra-processed foods, such as cereal, plant-based milk, and flavored yogurt—even when both diets met British nutrition guidelines. Ultra-processed foods seem to make people overeat, because they contain more calories per gram and less water and fiber than, say, fruits and vegetables, and because they tend to be what nutritionists call “hyperpalatable,” or extremely tasty, due to their combinations of sugar, fat, and salt.

Ultra-processed foods have, of course, existed for more than a century. Margarine, one of the first such concoctions, has been maligned nearly since its invention, with one turn-of-the-20th-century U.S. senator disparaging it as “matured under the chill of death, blended with vegetable oils and flavored by chemical tricks.” But the term ultra-processed foods was conceived in 2009 by the Brazilian researcher Carlos Monteiro, who had noticed changes in Brazilians' diets and wanted to warn of the increasing consumption of prepackaged foods, as the journalist Julia Belluz and the researcher Kevin Hall write in their new book, Food Intelligence. Monteiro believed it was not sugar and fat per se that were contributing to obesity, but those components' being processed and recombined into ready-to-eat snacks. In the years after Monteiro's coinage of the term, studies about the harms of ultra-processed foods trickled into medical journals, and mainstream food experts in America and elsewhere recommended sharply limiting their consumption.

Most nutritionists still agree that eating a bag of corn chips is far less healthy than eating an ear of corn. But some are now acknowledging that the “ultra-processed” category, which makes up about 60 percent of the American diet, has become too broad and difficult for many families to understand. “It's insanity to me that bran flakes is in the same category as sweets,” Nicola Guess, a dietitian and researcher at the University of Oxford, told me. (Guess has consulted for companies that make plant-based meat alternatives—which are also ultra-processed foods.) Jimmy Chun Yu Louie, a dietitian at Swinburne University of Technology, in Australia, pointed out in a recent review paper that tofu is sometimes categorized as an ultra-processed food, despite being “a nutritionally rich protein central to many Asian cuisines for generations.” He concluded, “The evidence suggests that not all UPFs are inherently ‘bad.'”

Lumping soy milk and Takis in the same category has obscured the fact that although many ultra-processed foods are unhealthy, some are reasonably nutritious. Though the consumption of some ultra-processed foods is associated with “every bad outcome you can imagine,” Guess said, foods such as ultra-processed yogurt, bread, and breakfast cereals can be neutral or even beneficial. In fact, in the study that found that eating minimally processed foods led to twice as much weight loss, the participants who ate somewhat-healthy ultra-processed foods also lost weight—just not as much as the people eating minimally processed food. After all, bottled salad dressing is an ultra-processed food that people use in small amounts on healthy foods such as lettuce and cucumbers, which doesn't necessarily negate the vegetables' health benefits. In a 2023 study, researchers described how it was possible to prepare a day's worth of healthy meals in which at least 80 percent of the calories were from ultra-processed foods, with a breakfast of, for instance, instant oatmeal and ultra-filtered milk, and a dinner of gluten-free pasta. Ultra-processed foods can also be essential to people with dietary restrictions: Splenda, oat milk, and protein powder are all ultra-processed. (So is baby formula, which is necessary for infants whose mothers cannot or do not wish to feed them with breast milk.)

More of kids' than adults' daily calories come from ultra-processed foods—a fact that, if you're a parent, you probably already know. Ohhh, do you ever know. You know the head-popping befrazzlement of running late for day-care pickup and needing to just get something into the kid before bedtime, so you reach for frozen chicken nuggets. You know what it's like to spend hours cooking homemade pasta sauce with hidden veggies for said child, who, because of their picky eating, is on the brink of scurvy, only to be told they “don't yike it.” (And then to find yourself eating homemade pasta sauce with hidden veggies all week to avoid wasting it.) You know of the best-laid plans to prep homemade veggie bites on a Sunday, only to have to run your kid to urgent care that day, so you beeline instead to the holy land of ultra-processed food: Trader Joe's.

Unprocessed foods typically require more effort than ultra-processed foods to make palatable, and more money to buy—which many overstretched, budget-strapped parents can't spend. When cooking an entirely unprocessed meal, “You have to be like, What am I going to cook? What am I shopping for?” Julia Wolfson, a Johns Hopkins University health-policy professor, told me, adding that you then also have to prep and store the food in a way that it won't go bad. “It's a lot of planning and cognitive functioning and mental energy, which is not time- or cost-neutral.” Then, of course, there's the actual cooking: “For a lot of people,” Wolfson said, “you've got kids running around, you've got stuff going on, you're multitasking.” And don't forget the cleanup! In a 2024 study, Wolfson found that people who spend more time cooking consume fewer ultra-processed foods and more unprocessed foods, and other studies have found that people who spend more time cooking tend to have higher-quality diets overall. The average American, however, spends less than an hour a day preparing food.

Reams of studies have also found that healthy diets are more expensive than unhealthy ones—sometimes as much as doubly so. “My tomato sauce that I buy with no high-fructose corn syrup and no sugar, all fresh ingredients, costs twice as much as the other ones,” Christopher Gardner, a nutrition scientist at Stanford, told me. Jessica Wilson, a dietician based in Sacramento, says that many of her clients are on Medicaid or SNAP benefits, and that if they didn't eat processed foods, they would skip meals because the unprocessed alternatives are too expensive. She recommends that, rather than avoid all ultra-processed foods, her clients buy canned soups and chilis, cured meats and cheeses, boxed soup broths, and various refrigerated and frozen meals. And even in cases where an unprocessed diet is cheaper than an ultra-processed one, time also has a cost, and many people would rather pay a company to chop or cook their foods for them.

Unprocessed-food moms on social media tend to gloss over the sheer amount of money and prep work involved in life without convenience foods. Gretchen Adler—whose Instagram bio reads “Real food. Better health.”—made her own sourdough pizza, ranch dressing, and honey-sweetened cake for her 4-year-old's birthday, with no mention of who was watching said 4-year-old during this culinary marathon. Ballerina Farm's Hannah Neeleman, a mom of eight, seems to spend hours a day making homemade scones and churning butter, which, thanks to the power of time-lapse videography, looks like it takes just a few minutes. But Neeleman is essentially paid to do that; being a farm-wife influencer is one of her jobs. Meanwhile, a life of constant butter-churning is “not how the vast majority of people live or even want to live,” Guess, the Oxford researcher, said.

The dieticians and nutritionists I spoke with acknowledged that, these days, most families cannot completely avoid ultra-processed foods. Instead, these experts promote a kind of harm reduction: adding fresh vegetables to a bowl of instant ramen, say, or just minimizing the amount of saturated fat, salt, and added sugar in the ultra-processed foods you do eat. Guess tells people to worry less about things such as ultra-processed yogurt and to instead avoid the stuff that we “already know is crap,” such as Doritos and candy. Gardner recommended that, when evaluating an ultra-processed food, people consider how many strange-sounding ingredients it has. The fewer additives, the better. And, crucially, compare it with what you might eat instead. If the “instead” is a minimally processed double bacon cheeseburger, just get the ultra-processed dressing and put it on a fresh salad. Your kids still won't touch it, but at least it'll make healthy eating a little easier for you.

The genre is so diverse that with a little open-mindedness, everyone really can find their perfect match.

Friends become lovers. Enemies become lovers. Former lovers get a second chance together. Arranged marriages generate real feelings. A human falls in love with a high lord of the fae. These are just a few of the plots readers can find in modern romance novels, which vary in tone, setting, and characters but are united by one key characteristic: a central love story that culminates in the all-important HEA (happily ever after, for the uninitiated). Everything leading up to that—the meet-cute, the first kiss, the third-act breakup—is left to the author.

In recent years, the expansion of the format, and the plot freedom that followed, have led to a wider diversity of stories for readers who might want something other than the typical supermarket paperback offerings. As Adriana Herrera, a best-selling author of more than a dozen romances, told me, “The great thing about romance is that there is literally a writer or a book for every single reading taste in the moment.” There are historical romances, as well as romances set in futuristic dystopias. There are cozy romances and dark romances. There are holiday romances, cowboy romances, hockey romances.

In other words, anyone open-minded enough to set aside popular preconceptions about the genre really can find their perfect match. The eight books below are all absorbing enough to draw in longtime romance fans and newbies alike. Although their protagonists must walk their own tangled paths to get to their HEA, each book offers the same reassuring guarantee: Everything will work out in the end.



We Could Be So Good, by Cat Sebastian

Nick is a newspaper beat reporter and a gay man in the 1950s who's determined to keep his personal and professional lives separate. Andy, the son of the paper's owner, has just been dumped, leaving him in need of somewhere to stay while he learns the ins and outs of his father's business. Naturally, he ends up crashing at Nick's apartment. As any romance reader could guess, their forced proximity leads to sexual tension, along with confusion—are they friends? Might they be more than friends? The two present a classic example of what's known in the genre as a “grumpy-sunshine” pairing, in which Andy's relentless optimism becomes so irresistible that it brightens Nick's serious nature. In a refreshing turn, even though Sebastian's protagonists are queer men living in a homophobic era, the book is more sweet than angsty, spending less time on whether two men can build a life together than on whether these particular two men want to.



Bringing Down the Duke, by Evie Dunmore

Dunmore's A League of Extraordinary Women series begins in 1879, at the opening of Oxford's first women's college (though no degrees would be awarded to women for several decades). Annabelle is selected to attend with a scholarship from a suffragist society. Her advocacy work, aiming to pass the Married Women's Property Act, puts her in the path of Sebastian, a powerful duke who is working, at Her Majesty's request, to defeat the progressives in Parliament. Their run-ins quickly set off sparks, and as they spend more time in each other's company, a mutual respect develops. Although Dunmore's fictionalization of their conflict elides some of the very real historical stakes for British women, the couple's genuine tenderness, in between and even during their arguments, makes the story—and their eventual relationship—truly come alive.

Book Lovers, by Emily Henry

City slicker visits a small town, falls in love with a local shop owner, and learns to appreciate the simple life: Most of us have heard the story before, and Nora, a literary agent in New York, wants no part of it. (In a hilarious twist, she's been dumped no fewer than three times by boyfriends whose small-town sojourns became permanent.) Her happily married sister, Libby, is determined to change Nora's mind, and books them a girls' trip to the town of Sunshine Falls, the setting of a recent best seller by one of Nora's clients. As the pair work through a to-do list of Hallmark-movie moments (get a makeover, try to save a small business), Libby's scheming is both successful and not: Nora falls in love, but not with their storybook location or a local eligible bachelor. Instead, she finds herself drawn to a surly book editor she knows from back home, who also happens to be visiting. Ultimately, Henry layers the traditional romance with a love story between the sisters.



The Duke Heist, by Erica Ridley

Yes, another duke. Historical-romance authors love the British peerage system so much that bookstore shelves groan with many, many more dukedoms than the two dozen or so that actually existed in the United Kingdom of the 19th century. But if readers can suspend their disbelief about that, then surely the premise of Ridley's charming Bridgerton–meets–Boxcar Children series is not too far a stretch: The late, eccentric Baron Vanderbean has left his sizable estate to the half dozen previously unrelated orphans he adopted. Now grown, the siblings use their fortune, along with their own peculiar talents—disguises, forgery, weapons handling—to lead Robin Hood–esque missions throughout London. In the course of one such quest, Chloe takes off in the getaway carriage—accidentally trapping a duke named Lawrence inside. Lawrence is entranced by Chloe, and she by him. There's just one problem: He needs to marry an heiress to revitalize his destitute estate, and she's masquerading as a poor orphan until she can safely recover a lost family heirloom. Thankfully, the misunderstandings get sorted out, and everyone gets what they want in the end.



Party of Two, by Jasmine Guillory

Picking a favorite book by Guillory is like picking a favorite cookie. They're all sweetly satisfying; it just depends on what flavor you're in the mood for. Perhaps you're interested in a fake-dating ruse that turns into real love. Maybe you want two rivals to realize how thin the line is between hate and love. In Party of Two—the fifth novel in a series featuring the same group of friends—the protagonist, Olivia, has to navigate the spotlight that comes with dating a senator without dulling her own ambitions. What makes Guillory's characters shine is their passion: for their work (some, including Olivia, are lawyers, as the author herself once was), for improving their communities, and for the simpler pleasures in life, which here mostly take the form of good food. Olivia and Max meet at a hotel bar, where she's enjoying an ice-cold martini with her Caesar salad and fries. They strike up a conversation about dessert. Later, he sends a cake to ask her on a date. The whole book offers a feast for both the heart and the stomach.

The Very Secret Society of Irregular Witches, by Sangu Mandanna

If you take out the witches, the world Mandanna has created is remarkably similar to our own. Even among those with magical abilities, familiar emotions and conflicts tend to surface. Mika is a lonely young woman: Her parents died when she was little, and the aunt who raised her taught her to conceal her powers for safety. The only place she lets them loose is online, where Mika, like so many people, can be whoever she wants. Eventually, her internet fame brings her to a remote spot on the British seaside to guide three young witches, all orphans like her. There she meets Jamie, a librarian who is determined to keep the girls safe in his own, non-magical way. Set in a world where extraordinary abilities mostly bring fear and loneliness, Mandanna's tale is a cozy meditation on trust and chosen family.



One Last Stop, by Casey McQuiston

Most romance novels have two main characters. One Last Stop arguably has three: August, Jane, and the New York City subway system. All August wants when she moves to Brooklyn is a fresh start; she doesn't expect the city to make her dreams come true, as some other transplants might. And yet it keeps forcing its magic on her: She lucks out in meeting roommates and co-workers who become real friends, and she keeps running into the same gorgeous girl, Jane, on the train. They fall for each other, and August begins to look forward to the otherwise-tedious task of commuting—until she realizes that their encounters aren't merely the product of chance. The rest of the story is best uncovered without too much foreknowledge, but it's safe to say that McQuiston's tale is part love story and part love letter to the quirks and wonders of public transportation.

Small Town Girl, by LaVyrle Spencer

While researching the country-music career of her main character, Spencer interviewed Reba McEntire to understand the life of an industry star, and the parts of this 1997 novel set in Nashville feel like a behind-the-curtain peek at Music Row. But when Tess—known as “Mac” to colleagues and fans, if not to her family—is forced to take time off from recording her latest album to care for her mother after surgery, she struggles to fit into the role of the novel's title. At home, she falls back into childhood dynamics with her mother and sisters. Adding to her disorientation is Kenny, the nerdy boy next door who's now a single father and beloved member of the community. When Tess takes on the role of mentoring Kenny's daughter, a talented country singer in her own right, the two get reacquainted. As in any good romance novel, their talking turns to flirting, which turns to kissing, which leads to tense conversations about how to merge their very different lives, which ends in—well, you know the rest.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Stop Lowering the Flag","https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/10/lowering-flag/684525/","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 12:30:00 GMT","

The symbol of public mourning loses its meaning when it's used too much.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

In the predawn hours of July 4, a small, blue house just outside Binghamton, New York, caught fire. James Sitek, chief of the West Colesville Fire Company, was one of the firefighters who responded to the blaze. Shortly after emerging from the building, he went into cardiac arrest. He was pronounced dead at the hospital later that day.

The following week, more than 200 people attended Sitek's funeral. New York Governor Kathy Hochul had ordered American flags on government buildings across the state to be lowered to half-staff in his honor. In Binghamton, the lowered flag was a potent sign of a community in mourning. Elsewhere in the state, though—100 miles to the west or the north or the east—it would likely have elicited only a shrug.

Lowering the flag was once a relatively rare symbol of public mourning and respect. But Sitek's flag lowering was the 21st in the state during the first seven months of this year—beginning with a month-long commemoration of President Jimmy Carter that started just before the new year and continuing with respects paid to, among others, four former members of Congress, two New York State Police officers, and a highway-maintenance supervisor for the state Department of Transportation.

Read: The space between mourning and grief

In the past 15 years, flags in New York have been lowered more than 250 times for a total of more than 850 days of public mourning. That equates to roughly one day a week.

New York is not unique. States across the country now lower the flag for all manner of tragedies, as well as an array of annual federal observances, some of which—Peace Officers Memorial Day, for instance—many people do not realize exist.

A ritual's power does not lie in “the ritual itself, but in the meaning that people attach to it,” Nancy Berns, a sociologist at Drake University who studies grief, told me. Far from uniting us in common feeling, the sight of a lowered flag today is more likely to trigger a generalized sense of disquiet: Something bad has happened, just like it always does. Flag lowering has become a largely empty gesture, illegible to the broader public and ultimately ignored.

The first widely recognized report of a flag being lowered to mark a death came in 1612, when a Greenlandic Inuit killed the British explorer James Hall with a spear, apparently in retaliation for his countrymen's kidnapping of several Inuit on an earlier expedition. Hall's ship, the Heart's Ease, sailed back to London with the flag “hanging down, in token and sign of the death of Mr. Hall, our general,” a member of the crew wrote.

The observance was used sparingly in early American history to mark significant deaths—George Washington's, in 1799, Andrew Jackson's, in 1845—or to express public approbation. Flags were brought to half-staff in 1765 to protest the Stamp Act, which imposed a British war tax on the colonists. Eighty-nine years later, Chicago shipowners lowered their flags when their senator opposed spending on key river and harbor projects.

Such commemorations were, for the most part, spontaneous and locally initiated as part of broader demonstrations of public sorrow. “Minute guns are firing, and flags are lowered to half-mast on all public buildings and on the shipping,” a New Orleans journalist observed in 1852 after the death of the “Great Compromiser,” Senator Henry Clay. “Business is suspended, and the whole city, without distinction of party, join in the general grief.”

Any high marks of universal sorrow were soon overshadowed by the devastation of the Civil War. In both the North and the South, loss was omnipresent, and flags were lowered to honor the dead during many of the remembrances that took place in the years after the war.

It was not until 1954 that some uniformity was introduced to the practice. President Dwight Eisenhower, concerned about haphazard displays, established parameters that remain in effect today: 30 days at half-staff following the death of a president; 10 days for a vice president, Supreme Court chief justice, or speaker of the House of Representatives; and so on. He also gave the president discretion to bestow the honor more generally.

Read: Trump just made burning the flag a little easier

President Bill Clinton was the first to accelerate the trend nationally, according to Brandon Rottinghaus, a political scientist at the University of Houston who has studied presidential proclamations. Clinton signed National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day into law, directed that the flag should be lowered each year on Peace Officers Memorial Day, and was generally more liberal in his use of the gesture than his predecessors.

Succeeding presidents have surpassed Clinton in frequency of flag lowering, and in some cases put their own imprint on the practice. President Barack Obama often called upon the symbol to recognize those killed in mass shootings. “There was a sense that polarization was rising and one option to lower the temperature was to bring the country together through these moments of reflection,” Rottinghaus told me.

President Donald Trump, who has ordered the flag to half-staff seven times during his second term, has also honored victims of mass shootings, including those killed at a school in Minneapolis in August. His use of the gesture in other cases has been more partisan, marking the assassination of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk, for example, but not that of Melissa Hortman, a Democratic lawmaker from Minnesota.

Governors, though, have contributed the most to the trend over the years. In many states, the laws surrounding flag lowering are vague. In New York, the governor may honor any “public servant who, in the opinion of the local agency concerned, contributed to the community.” Such proclamations can be useful as a political gesture, one that costs a governor nothing to issue.

The result is that EMTs, police officers, and highway-crew workers who die on the job now commonly receive the same honor once traditionally bestowed only on the nation's great statesmen and military heroes.

The order to lower the flag comes frequently, but is applied inconsistently. On the day of Sitek's statewide honor, I drove past 20 public flagpoles—outside town halls, libraries, firehouses, schools, and parks—near my house in Rochester, about 150 miles from Binghamton. Only two of them had lowered their flag.

I met a man named Rasheed Hayood walking by one of them. He didn't know why the flag was at half-staff. But when I told him about Sitek, he said he supported the gesture. “He was doing good out here,” he said. “Those are the people we have to love.” Hayood turned out to be a security guard at a retirement home who often took it upon himself to lower the flag outside when he heard that a member of the military had died.

The human impulse to grieve together is irrepressible. We sit shiva. We paint murals and print T-shirts. We dress in special clothes and drive in slow processions to cemeteries that serve as physical gathering places for mourners and the mourned alike. We understand that being a part of a community means that suffering must be shared.

Read: There are no ‘five stages' of grief

Flag lowering, for the most part, no longer fulfills that purpose. Stacy Otto, a professor at the Illinois State College of Education who has written about public displays of grief, suggested that it can even be a way to evade the weight of that shared grief.

“People are uncomfortable with other people dying,” she told me. “When we lower flags to half-staff, we can say we're doing something and honoring people, but it's kind of a grief lite. It's grief with the pain removed.”

Reducing the frequency of flag lowering could imbue the gesture with meaning once more. We could also embrace other kinds of public mourning: moments of silence at events; impromptu roadside shrines made of candles, photographs, or other personal mementos; and more lasting gestures such as renaming buildings and planting trees. “Different means of mourning are going to reach different people,” Berns, the sociologist, said.

Sitek's wife, Suzanne, told me that the lowered flags honoring her husband meant a lot to her as a proud American. Their son, Matthew, who is also a volunteer firefighter, said that it “was a very nice and courteous professional gesture” but one that his grief left him little energy to appreciate. More significant, he said, was the way community members rallied around the family in less public ways. When, in the days after his dad's death, the pump on his mother's well got knocked out in a storm, a squadron of firefighters showed up to help repair it.

The procession taking James Sitek to his final resting place covered 10 miles, and flags were lowered along the way. But other honors spoke more clearly to his life: The white gloves and dress caps on the scores of first responders who attended the funeral. The gleam of carefully polished fire trucks in the July sun. The keening of bagpipes. And, as Sitek's body was carried from the church, the tolling of the fire bell, indicating the end of his decades-long service.

In a new book, John J. Lennon presses two cases: that his is a work of legitimate journalism, and that this makes him something more than a killer.

John J. Lennon was 24 years old in December of 2001 when he shot his former friend Alex Lawson with an M-16 assault rifle, then transferred Lawson's body to a laundry bag with a cinder block inside and hurled it into the Atlantic Ocean. The bag washed ashore on a Brooklyn beach in February of the following year. Lennon is now serving his 24th year of a 28-year sentence at Sing Sing Correctional Facility in New York, where he has become a prolific and celebrated writer on matters of criminal justice.

There is considerable demand for content related to true crime; streaming services are awash with episodic shows delving into crime and criminal investigations; podcasts in the same category number in the tens of thousands. Much of the output that falls within that category is true—fact-checked, verified—but what Lennon suggests in his book, The Tragedy of True Crime: Four Guilty Men and the Stories That Define Us, is that a deeper look into the lives of true crime's villains can reveal a much more ambiguous picture than the genre's good-versus-evil formula tends to permit. Many people who commit heinous crimes have a history of criminal victimization themselves. From this vantage, evil becomes something dauntingly diffuse, with culpability for any given bad act branching outward through society like spidering veins.

The Tragedy of True Crime is devoted to challenging the simplistic narratives advanced by the true-crime genre, largely by establishing that there is more to the prototypical antagonist than his crimes. In this way, Lennon seems to be making an implicit argument that murderers' identities should not forever be defined by their worst act. For Lennon, the book itself is an assertion of his identity beyond that of a killer: He is earnestly insistent that his book is a work of journalism, which is hard to dispute, and that he himself is a journalist, which is equally hard to dispute. Lennon is a contributing editor at Esquire, and has written for a wide range of respected publications, including The New York Review of Books, The New York Times Magazine, Rolling Stone, New York magazine, and The Atlantic. His crime precipitated his career, and his work is two things at once: legitimate, solid journalism, and a bid at redemption. It achieves the former; the latter may be beyond journalism's power.

Lennon's book certainly demonstrates an interest in the facts—many of which fall outside the usual true-crime purview, but are just as horrifying. The first of the cases Lennon considers is that of Matthew Shane Hale, who was convicted of the 1995 murder of his partner, Stefan Tanner, with whom he'd had a tumultuous and occasionally abusive relationship. When Hale decided to permanently end the affair, a fight broke out between the two men, and Hale bashed Tanner's head against a concrete floor before stuffing him into the trunk of his car and later covering his head with a plastic bag. In 1999, a New York jury sentenced Hale to a minimum of 50 years in prison with parole eligibility after 50 years.

That much is public record. What Lennon adds to the facts of the case are the elements that preceded it. Hale, Lennon writes, grew up gay in Kentucky, and was sexually abused at age 10 by the father of one of his friends, and by age 11 or 12, in his estimation, he was sexually servicing older boys, and then friends of his father's, and then, finally, his father himself. “When I did this, dad's hand would wind up on my head or ass,” Hale tells Lennon. “There was a part of me that had plausible deniability that what was happening was happening. Dad was passed out, and I was so starved for dad's attention and affection that I would resort to molesting my father.”

Here Lennon offers an account of sexual abuse so frank and blunt, it almost seems addressed to fans of true crime, who may be used to tales of graphic violence but less acquainted with the torture, desperation, and privation that tend to mark the lives of murderers before their offenses. Typically, the gory detail marshaled by true-crime creators serves to heighten a forthcoming catharsis: The more heinous the murder, the more satisfying the eventual incarceration, death, or execution. But here, the level of detail devoted to the crimes committed against Hale in his early years serves to complicate, rather than accentuate, the notion of Hale as irredeemable. The fact that many murderers live horrendously difficult lives prior to their crimes is disquieting: It suggests that murder arises not necessarily from some deliberate private initiative but also from factors outside a person's control, including innate limitations (such as intellectual disability and mental illness) and psychological and emotional damage inflicted upon them by others.

Lennon is careful not to present any of those factors as an excuse for murder, especially when he considers his own background. He describes a turbulent and impoverished childhood amid a culture of criminality that he credits with his early engagement in using and selling drugs. But Lennon also acknowledges that he is responsible for the catastrophic choices he made leading up to Lawson's murder, as well as the ones that came after. Lennon writes that he came to prison entirely unreformed, and immediately immersed himself in the violent subculture of prison gangs.

Lennon's other case studies concern Milton Jones, a New York man who murdered two Catholic priests in 1987, when he was 17 years old, and Robert Chambers, the so-called “preppy killer,” who strangled a teenage girl to death in Central Park in 1986. Milton's background was marked by poverty, abuse, neglect, and early exposure to violence, and he showed signs of untreated mental illness at an early age. Lennon intimates that childhood experiences beyond Milton's control inclined him to violence—and then, in an interesting contrast, introduces Chambers's case, which unfolded in a seemingly opposite way. Unlike Milton, Chambers was born into relative privilege, then attended expensive prep schools and earned admission to Boston University; his upscale background, in conjunction with the youth of his victim, led to a media frenzy around the case. But Lennon's examination of Chambers's case reveals an isolated and alienated person, adrift in society, who had descended into drug use, alcoholism, and petty theft. Lennon documents Milton's struggles with mental illness in prison, where psychiatric disorders are rarely treated adequately—a commentary on incarceration as a form of warehousing the mentally ill. Lennon also tracks Chambers's experiences with release and reincarceration, a fair-minded acknowledgment that some people are too damaged to take advantage of second chances.

True-crime fans may be primed to prize a neat wrap-up to harrowing tales of violent crime—the perpetrator goes to prison and the matter is settled—but Lennon observes that those conclusions, too, mask deep ambiguities. He reports, for instance, that he interviewed the lead detective on Hale's murder case and learned that the specific events leading up to Tanner's death were presented differently by the prosecution than by the detectives. Lennon takes this to suggest that the prosecution may have fabricated some elements altogether. What Lennon finds is not dispositive of prosecutorial misconduct, but the discrepancy ought to give one pause. Many offenders' cases continue long after they are convicted and imprisoned, often leading to evidence that complicates official narratives.

Crime is criminogenic, meaning that criminal victimization increases a person's likelihood of committing crimes themselves. This is somewhat difficult to accept, because it reveals that criminal activity is often part of a chain of wrongdoing into which the offender was drawn, and because it implies that abuse might inflict moral damage, among its many harms.

But murder is not something you can undo with the undertaking of a new career. In 2019, The Washington Post Magazine ran an essay by Lennon titled “The Apology Letter,” in which he explores his struggle to come to terms with his remorse for Lawson's murder, explaining that he has changed radically since the homicide, largely due to his career as a journalist. “The more I published, the more I felt like I was earning a new identity,” Lennon wrote. “I no longer wanted to be the killer, I wanted to be the writer.” Months later, the Post ran a letter to the editor from Lennon's victim's sister, Taisha Lawson, who excoriated Lennon as insincere, with an appetite for notoriety. She also posted a petition several years ago on MoveOn.org protesting the possibility of Lennon receiving clemency, which argued that Lennon's “occupation does not change the fact that he is capable of murder or lying for his own self interest … John J. Lennon the writer is still the man capable of cold-blooded murder.”

Humanizing the criminals behind true crime is, in Lennon's case, self-serving, and his efforts to fashion a new identity have been met with resistance. For him, insisting upon his identity as a journalist as opposed to a killer means laying claim to the kind of dignity and credibility typically denied to people behind bars, and perhaps the sort of validation and respect he had been searching for when he started down the criminal path that eventually led to murder.

No one in Taisha Lawson's position could be expected to feel anything but skeptical of that effort. Lennon ended her brother's life, and he doesn't deny this; in this instance, he is not looking so much for forgiveness as an opportunity to be something other than a killer. In writing this book, he has inarguably achieved that.

Free speech is endangered; unbiased and trustworthy news is elusive. In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?

An expert on political violence offers warnings — and some hope.

Political violence isn't new in America. But the reaction to it today feels different.

After the killing of Charlie Kirk, the country didn't rally around a message of restraint. Instead, key leaders treated it as ammunition. That shift, combined with a rise in tit-for-tat attacks and a politicized security apparatus, points to a more dangerous phase in our politics.

Barbara Walter is a political scientist at University of California San Diego and the author of How Civil Wars Start. She studies how democracies slide into instability — and how they pull back. I invited Walter onto The Gray Area to talk about what makes this moment distinct, why lone-actor violence is rising, how leaders' rhetoric can normalize force, and what it would actually take to lower the temperature.

As always, there's much more in the full podcast, so listen and follow The Gray Area on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pandora, or wherever you find podcasts. New episodes drop every Monday.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

We've seen a lot of political violence over the history of this country, and certainly there have been more violent periods than this one. But you've said this moment still feels different — and more dangerous — than earlier waves of violence. Why?

There are three big differences. The first is how our leaders are responding. Historically, when tragedy struck — whether it was an assassination, a terrorist attack, or a domestic bombing — the instinct among political leaders was to unify the country. That's especially important in a place as diverse and heterogeneous as the United States. After events like 9/11, after the Oklahoma City bombing, after political assassinations in the 1960s, you saw Democrats and Republicans stand together, condemn the violence, and reassure people that we were one nation.

This time, that didn't happen. Within hours of Charlie Kirk's killing, key figures on the right used it as a political weapon. Instead of calls for peace or restraint, it became a rallying cry. We saw people like Laura Loomer and Steve Bannon go straight to “civil war” language. Even the president spoke about “going after them,” even though, as we later learned, this was a lone actor — a young man radicalized online. The immediate response wasn't unity. It was vengeance. That's new, and it's dangerous.

You have a useful phrase — “violence entrepreneurs” — to describe people who take chaotic or random events and weaponize them for political gain.

That's what we're seeing. A single act of violence becomes propaganda. Instead of treating these as isolated crimes, political actors fold them into a broader narrative of existential threat: “They're out to get us.” That language radicalizes faster than any ideology.

You've also written that violence is no longer one-sided and that this shift makes the situation even more volatile. Tell me about the dynamic that emerges once we get caught in a spiral like that?

It does make the situation more volatile. For a long time, political violence in the US came overwhelmingly from the far right. Now we're starting to see incidents from the other end of the spectrum. It's still fewer, but the rise is real and significant.

A recent study by Dan Byman at Georgetown found that attacks linked to far-left causes are at their highest levels in 30 years. That doesn't mean equivalence. The far right remains far more lethal, but it does mean the dynamic is changing. And when violence stops being one-sided, it becomes self-sustaining. Each side points to the other as proof of an imminent threat.

In the 1990s, after the Oklahoma City bombing, the FBI was able to identify and infiltrate militias, prosecute leaders, and dramatically reduce membership. That was possible because the threat was concentrated in one place. Once you have reciprocal violence — right and left, each using the other's attacks to justify its own — the logic becomes self-feeding.

What's the “self-feeding” logic? That violence is no longer seen as a choice but rather as an act of defense or self-preservation?

That's right. And that shift — from ideological violence to defensive violence — is when democracies tip into instability. Every country has a fringe that dreams of revolution. Most people want safety. But if you convince enough citizens that their safety and survival are under attack, they'll tolerate almost anything. They'll arm themselves. They'll look the other way when opponents are targeted.

Your third reason for concern is about the state of law enforcement — that our institutions aren't what they once were. What do you mean?

“And here's the key: Incoherent violence is still politically useful. Opportunistic leaders can project any narrative they want onto it.”

I mean the leadership. The FBI, Homeland Security, even the Defense Department — these are crucial guardians of internal stability. For most of modern history, they were led by professionals with deep expertise, people trusted to operate above partisanship. That's no longer the case.

Today, we have leaders who are political appointees first, experts second. We're talking about people with little experience and strong partisan loyalties. Imagine if someone like Kash Patel had been FBI director after Oklahoma City. He wouldn't have known how to dismantle militias, and he might have been told not to. When the people at the top don't believe in the mission or don't understand it, even the best agents beneath them can't function.

So the danger isn't the rank and file so much as the politicization of the top.

Exactly. You can have brilliant, dedicated public servants throughout those agencies, but if leadership is partisan and cowardly, they won't act on the intelligence they have.

You study civil wars. If there's a spectrum where one end is perfect social peace and harmony and the other pole is Mad Max: Fury Road, where is the United States right now?

I'd say that we're in the high-risk zone. That doesn't mean armies facing each other in the field — modern civil wars rarely look like that. They look more like insurgency or sustained domestic terror: sporadic attacks, targeted killings, the erosion of safety in daily life. Think of Israel's long struggle with Hamas. It's not a conventional war, but a constant, low-level threat that makes normal life feel precarious.

Americans tend to treat events like Buffalo or El Paso or Pittsburgh as isolated tragedies. But seen together, they form a pattern: steady, ideologically charged violence that's been normalized. That's the danger — when a society stops recognizing violence as extraordinary.

What are the underlying conditions that create that “high-risk” environment?

I'd focus on three things. The first is a weak democracy. Most political violence happens not in dictatorships or strong democracies but in partial democracies — regimes that are neither fully open nor fully closed. That's where the US sits today.

The second condition is identity-based political parties. When parties are organized around race, religion, or ethnicity, competition becomes more existential. The Republican Party is still about 80 percent white in a multiethnic nation; that makes it an identity-based party by definition.

The third condition is status loss. The group that once held dominance and feels it slipping — politically, culturally, demographically — is the one most likely to turn to violence.

How much has public acceptance of political violence changed? What does the data tell us?

Surveys show it's growing. When asked if violence is justified “under some circumstances,” more Americans now say yes. In some polls, as many as four in ten say violence can be justified in self-defense. Historically, that number was near zero. It's rising on both sides, though still higher on the right.

Going from “near zero” to four out of 10 is…concerning.

It is. The models political scientists use put the annual risk of significant instability at roughly 4 percent for countries like ours — partially democratic, identity-divided. Four percent sounds small, but if nothing changes, it compounds. Ten years later, you're in coin-flip territory. Twenty years later, near certainty. The key question is whether the fundamentals improve or degrade.

What about from the top down? We talked about the reactions of leaders to violence earlier, but there's also a long history of leaders manufacturing acts of violence to cement their own power.

That's another piece I'm increasingly worried about, something I haven't written about yet but Americans should understand. Most civil wars begin from below, driven by factions or militias. But wars are also started by leaders. In these cases, war is deliberately manufactured to keep a ruler in power, to slam the door on democracy.

Look at Putin. After his initial democratic election in the 1990s, he consolidated power by starting a war in Chechnya, then Syria, then Crimea, then Ukraine. Each conflict stirred nationalism, created a rally-around-the-flag effect, and allowed him to declare emergency rule — suspending normal democratic constraints as long as the fighting continued.

When I wake up in the middle of the night and worry about America, this is what I think about: that before the 2028 election, when he's supposed to be term-limited out, Donald Trump could fabricate some kind of emergency — one that includes organized violence — and use it as a pretext to stay in the White House.

The one big variable at play now that wasn't in the past is the internet and social media, which you've described as an “accelerant.” How does that fit in?

Imagine the same demagogue without social media. We grew up in that world — three TV networks, editors who filtered what aired, shared sources of truth. Today, leaders don't need traditional gatekeepers. They can communicate directly with millions, amplify division, normalize violence, and target enemies in real time.

The technology isolates people in echo chambers, feeds them outrage, and makes them feel constantly under threat. That's not just a communication problem. It's a structural vulnerability and a force multiplier for polarization and radicalization.

In the past, much of America's political violence felt more organized. The Weather Underground, the Klan, militias, even Oklahoma City — there were clear ideological projects behind all of this. A lot of recent attacks seem almost post-ideological — less coherent movements than chaotic individuals. Does that change how we should understand them?

The ideology now is often incoherent, but that doesn't make it harmless. Many of these attackers are steeped in online culture — memes, irony, trolling. It looks unserious, but it's a gateway to radicalization. The mix of “jokes,” conspiracy, and alienation becomes its own belief system.

And here's the key: Incoherent violence is still politically useful. Opportunistic leaders can project any narrative they want onto it. Whether the killer's motives are fascist, leftist, or nihilist doesn't matter. It will be spun as evidence that the other side is evil and a reason for revenge, or for crackdowns.

So the danger isn't just violence itself, but how it's interpreted.

When the motive is muddy, narrative fills the vacuum. And when the loudest megaphones belong to people eager to exploit chaos, the narrative almost always escalates fear.

Are you surprised that we don't see more political violence than we do? Given how polarized we are, given how many guns we have, given how much we've deranged ourselves online?

Not really. Americans are, on the whole, remarkably kind and generous. If you travel this country — even to its reddest or bluest corners — most people are friendly. What's heartbreaking is how that basic decency coexists with political dysfunction and gun saturation.

Other advanced democracies don't live like this. Our gun laws make every outburst more lethal. If we simply kept firearms out of the hands of people with domestic-violence histories or untreated mental illness, the number of tragedies would plummet. That's not partisan. It's just basic harm reduction.

So solutions have to come from the bottom up?

I think so. Congress has ceded much of its checking power to the presidency. Neither party has delivered serious democratic reforms. Real change will come from civic action: massive voter turnout, broad-based peaceful protest, and local pressure for fair elections.

If 75 or 80 percent of eligible Americans voted, even in midterms, the composition of Congress would look entirely different. We know from history that when just 3 or 4 percent of a population engages in sustained, nonviolent protest, regimes shift. The math is on the people's side — if they use it.

Some people will hear this and think it's an overreaction, that bad things happen, they've always happened, they've been much worse than this in the past, and the system always self-corrects. 

I wish that were true. But democracies rarely collapse overnight. It's a gradual slide — what Hungarians call “death by a thousand cuts.” Each violation of a norm feels small, forgivable, even reasonable. Over time, those cuts add up. By the time citizens realize what's been lost, it's too late to reverse.

That's what Viktor Orbán did in Hungary. He was elected democratically, then slowly rewrote the rules: changed voting laws, captured the courts, silenced the press. Each step was survivable; together, they ended democracy.

So what gives you hope?

The American public. I don't believe most Americans will roll over for authoritarianism. They're used to freedom. They value it deeply, even when they disagree about everything else. If they realize what's at stake, they'll act. That's my hope.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?

﻿Some parasites can bend bugs to their will. Scientists are trying to figure out how.

Zombies, it turns out, are real — and science journalist Mindy Weisberger can give you plenty of examples of them.

She's read up on the fungi that take over flies' bodies, partially digesting them from the inside out before forcing them to climb up blades of grass, so that fungal spores can explode out from their swollen corpses and claim new victims.

She's considered the hairworms that grow inside of crickets before inducing their hosts to toss themselves into a nearby body of water, where the worms emerge from the crickets' exoskeleton in a miniature but all-too-real imitation of the alien in Alien.

She's even researched the snails that fall victim to certain flatworms. The flatworms' larvae need to be eaten by birds to reach the next stage of their lifecycle, so broodsacs full of larvae take up residence in the snails' eyestalks and turn them into pulsing, colorful, caterpillar-like bird-lures. The parasite also manipulates the snails into wandering into the open in order to increase the odds that a bird will spot the snails and devour both their eyestalks and the larvae within them.

Weisberger dug into these specific nightmare-inducing examples of parasitic mind-control — and many others — as part of her effort to understand real-life “zombification” in her book, Rise of the Zombie Bugs. What she found was that these natural zombie stories are not only sources of inspiration for horrifying fiction — they could also inspire researchers who are trying to better understand everything from immune responses to pest control.

So we spoke to Weisberger about research on real-life zombies for Unexplainable, Vox's science podcast. What follows is a version of our conversation, edited for clarity and length. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Unexplainable wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts and Spotify.

Let's start by just defining some terms. What do we mean when we say “zombifier,” or “zombie?”

Sure. A zombifier is an organism that manipulates the behavior of its host, and a zombie is an organism that is being manipulated to behave in a way that it normally would not, and which only benefits the parasite that's manipulating it.

Let's say you catch a cold — you're gonna change your behavior because you're feeling sick. You feel like you need to rest more, you need to drink more water. These are all things that help you recover, that help you fight off the infection. So in a certain sense, that's the cold virus generating a change in behavior, but it's a behavioral change that actually benefits you.

For a zombie, the changes to its behavior are not something that benefit the host. They only benefit the parasite. That's what makes it a zombie.

So it'd be like if I got sick and instead of going into my room and trying to sleep it off, I went and I licked everybody that I could lick in order to spread it. 

Yeah, exactly. There are zombifying viruses; there are zombifying fungi; there are insects that are able to zombify their hosts. There are worms that can zombify their hosts. Most of the organisms that they infect are arthropods — bugs. (I do have to apologize to entomologists, because as far as entomologists are concerned, bugs are only insects with sucking mouth parts. However, as we all know, colloquially, “bugs” covers a much broader range.)

What are some of the biggest categories of mysteries about how [zombifiers do what they do]?

Some of the biggest mysteries start with the moment that the host is infected, because obviously a body's first response to any kind of infection is going to be an immune response. The first thing that a zombifier needs to do is to somehow get past that. That's a big question for zombifiers, from viruses to wasps to fungi to worms: When they get inside an organism where they're not supposed to be, how exactly are they telling their host immune system, “No, there's nothing to see here! Just go about your business! You don't need to worry about me!”

Another one is, once it gets to the point of manipulation, what are the cues? How does it decide “OK, now's the right time to get this host moving to a place where I need to be”?

The third big question is obviously the nuts and bolts of: How is it manipulating behavior? The thing about this field is that there is still so much that scientists are piecing together about the precise mechanisms of how this works. Behavior is something that is just super complicated, even in insects.

So, when we look at, for example, the wasp that parasitizes orb-weaving spiders, scientists have found that in the spiders that are zombified,  what the wasp does — it lays an egg on the spider. The egg hatches, and the wasp larva essentially piggybacks on the spider and drinks from it like it's a living juice box.

And the spider just goes about its business until the larva is ready to reproduce. And then somehow the wasp larvae is manipulating the spider to think that it's time to molt, so that the spider makes a different type of web than it normally does, something called a resting web. It's reinforced, and it's meant to support the spider and protect the spider while it's molting.

And then once that web is done, the wasp larvae drains the spider dry, the spider's empty husk of a corpse drops to the ground, and the wasp larva builds its cocoon and sets itself up in the spider's final web to hang out until it becomes an adult wasp.

What scientists found is that when spiders start making that final web, their little spider brains are being flooded with ecdysteroids, which is the hormone that the spider naturally releases when it's ready to build a molting web. And scientists aren't sure yet: Is the larvae actually producing the ecdysteroids? Is it somehow triggering its production in the spider through another compound? That's something that they're still figuring out.

Why is it important to understand how this behavior manipulation works?

In a lot of ways, this is looking at sort of really big questions about how behavior works, which is something that scientists are still piecing together, on so many levels for all different types of organisms, because there are so many factors that shape behavior. Some of them are genetics; some of them are biochemical; some of them have to do with environments; some of them have to do with social relationships. So, this is one way of trying to understand behavior writ large.

You mentioned that these insects suppress the immune systems of their hosts. Is there stuff that we could learn from that about how immune systems work in general?

Oh yeah. Looking at the immunosuppressive aspect of zombifiers is definitely something that is a huge area of interest, because that could inform the development of immunosuppressive drugs, which is something that is just something that would be hugely beneficial to people.

Not that this should be all about what's in it for me, but that is usually a consideration for scientific research: Could there potentially be applications for this that have medical applications? And so, there is not yet a direct line between any research into how zombifiers evade their host's immune system and the development of some kind of pharmaceutical immunosuppressive. But that's definitely something that is part of the mix when scientists are following that line of investigation.

I think about all the insects that invade homes, some of which are beneficial, some of which are less so. Could we potentially borrow from this to fight off pests?

Pest control is definitely one avenue that scientists have explored. Is there some way that we can take what we're seeing these zombifiers do to insects and apply it to insects that we don't like?

So baculoviruses — which are these viruses that infect caterpillars and make them climb and then dissolve their bodies into goo — this is something that has been deployed as a strategy for pest control in China and in Europe, in the US, in Brazil.

These types of viruses are an interesting alternative to traditional insecticides because they are very targeted. They're less toxic to the environment. They're not harmful to insects that are not their host species and they're not toxic to people. But they're also not as quick as I think the insecticides that people have gotten used to. And people like things to be quick and they like them to be absolute.

So what seems like the best way is perhaps to incorporate this alongside insecticides, and use this along with other approaches, because there are a lot of benefits to just going full-on zombie warfare to get rid of our agricultural pests.

Could humans be zombified this way? Like, are we also susceptible to this?

Well, there are some types of pathogens that are known to manipulate behavior in mammals and indeed in humans too. So rabies, of course. There have been medical cases of rabies-infected humans that are thousands of years old with documentation of heightened aggression. So there is already a virus among us that can manipulate human behavior.

And recently, there have been studies into Toxoplasma gondii, which is the pathogen that causes toxoplasmosis. Its definitive host is cats. It's very entrenched amongst human populations. And in fact, many, many people, millions of people, carry Toxoplasma gondii, but it doesn't cause any symptoms. It tends to be dangerous in people that are pregnant or in immunocompromised people. Most of the people who are carrying Toxoplasma gondii have no symptoms.

However, there have been studies recently in the last 10, 15 years or so, that have looked at people who are carrying the parasite and have found that there does seem to be evidence of certain types of behavior: of being more risk-taking, of being bolder. And what's interesting about it is that Toxoplasma gondii is known for manipulating behavior in rodents. And what it does is it makes them bolder and less afraid of cats.

What?

Because Toxoplasma gondii needs to reproduce inside cats. So it infects rodents, and then to get back into a cat, it makes the rodent less afraid of and attracted to the smell of cat pee. And that brings the rodent closer to a cat than it would normally go. And then once it's eaten, then the parasite is back inside the cat.

And scientists have found that this is true for other animals too. So hyena cubs that are infected with Toxoplasma gondii are bolder around lions and are more likely to be eaten by lions. Chimpanzees that are infected with Toxoplasma gondii lose their fear of jaguars. And some studies found that people who are infected with Toxoplasma gondii are more likely to make risky business decisions or be bolder in traffic.

There's still a lot of work to be done because obviously human behavior is its own form of complicated. But there is some evidence that seems to suggest that Toxoplasma gondii can shape human behavior, too.

What? 

Did I just blow your mind?

So there could literally at this moment be zombifiers within us shaping us in some way?

It's entirely possible. There are so many things that make us who we are that shape how we behave. There are environmental factors; there are social factors. But, you know, there might also be zombifiers.

One founder has ditched long pitch decks and presentations for AI.

""Famously, the Series A was the only time I made a pitch deck,"" Aravind Srinivas, the cofounder and CEO of Perplexity, said in an interview with Berkeley Haas released on Saturday.

Perplexity announced its $25.6 million Series A round in March 2023.

Pitch decks are slide shows that give investors and customers key details about a company's founders, its product, and its financial performance.

""I just write a memo and I tell them you can do a Q&A and ask whatever you want,"" Srinivas said, referring to potential investors. ""And anything else that is not internal data, you can ask Perplexity. Like, it already knows everything.""

Srinivas cofounded Perplexity in 2022 after working as a researcher at Google's DeepMind and OpenAI. In August, Business Insider reported that the AI search engine was seeking fresh funding at a $20 billion post-money valuation. The startup has attracted funding from investors including SoftBank, Nvidia, and Jeff Bezos.

During Saturday's interview, the CEO shared how he pitched to investors in the company's most recent funding round.

He said he hosted a Zoom webinar for one investor who put in a lot of money in this round, and he answered many of their questions on the spot.

""Then there was a lot of follow-up questions from there that they sent in a long email,"" he said. ""I copied the entire email, put it into Perplexity, and said: 'Answer it like Aravind.'""

""So I actually just replied to that email with the Perplexity answer link, and I asked, see if this suffices. If not, I can add more context,"" he said. ""They said: 'This is wonderful.' And they wired the money the next day.""

Jesse Dwyer, Perplexity's head of communications, told Business Insider after publication that Srinivas referred to tools like Perplexity's AI assistant Comet, which ""allow us to get highly accurate answers on any question about our business and internal data in real time.""

""This allows for investor meetings to be much more productive, because the real purpose of answers about the business is to unlock more questions about the business,"" Dwyer added.

While there are cases of founders not needing formal presentations because of high inbound investor interest, the no-pitch-deck approach is still rare in Silicon Valley.

In April, workforce management startup Rippling said that it raised a $45 million Series A round, led by Kleiner Perkins, without a formal pitch deck.

""Instead, the centerpiece of our fundraising materials was an Investor Memo, which laid out our pitch in prose,"" the company said in a blog post about the raise.

""Accompanying the Memo were 46 slides of metrics, projections, and detailed methodology footnotes; rather than share these as siloed Excel sheets at the diligence stage, we packaged them before the pitch,"" Rippling wrote.

You know the saying: Keep your friends close, and your trillion-dollar AI enemies closer.

The artificial intelligence explosion has sparked an intensity of competition in Silicon Valley not seen since the smartphone boom, as tech companies spend billions of dollars to sprint ahead with the most advanced models, access to the most compute power, and the best researchers.

The AI race has also brought some of these rivals closer together than ever. In some cases, uncomfortably close.

Just look at what's happened in the last few weeks. OpenAI signed a $300 billion deal to access Oracle's compute power — despite being majority-backed by Oracle rival Microsoft — while Meta signed a $10 billion deal for Google Cloud, per a person familiar. Microsoft, meanwhile, announced that it's giving its customers access to Anthropic's AI models, which run on Amazon and Google's cloud services. For all we fixate on the AI ""war,"" right now there's also a lot of AI lovemaking, as many of these companies need each other more than ever.

""The stakes are so high that you're seeing behavior that in the past wouldn't happen,"" said Gil Luria, managing director at investment firm D.A. Davidson. ""It's a big chess match of: how can I progress on my stuff, but also not miss the boat if someone else is winning?""

But how close is too close? Not only do these AI deals largely run on debt, they're also forming complex — and consequential — dependencies between companies. In late September, Nvidia announced a $100 billion investment in OpenAI, which in turn said it will build out at least 10 gigawatts of AI datacenters with Nvidia chips, an alliance that has raised the specter of vendor financing and memories of Cisco extending loans in the 90s so companies could purchase its telecoms equipment. Spoiler alert: that didn't end well.

In the knotty game of AI Twister, what happens when any one giant leg slips?

In some ways, Silicon Valley's rise to dominance has been built on enemies getting into bed with each other.

Google, for one, just got dragged through a federal court by the Justice Department because of its long-held deal with Apple — a direct competitor — to be the default search engine on the iPhone. In return, Apple gets a huge revenue stream for doing very little work. (In 2022, Google paid Apple a whopping $20 billion, per the DOJ.) The rise of the cloud giants also created an intricate web of dependencies, as smaller rivals began renting the compute powers from the titans they were trying to take down. Amazon offers Apple TV+ on Prime Video. Netflix runs on Amazon's cloud servers. Apple relies on Samsung components for its phones that compete with Samsung's.

Now the AI boom and spurred a new generation of relationships born out of necessity, while deepening existing ones.

At Goldman Sachs' Communacopia + Technology conference in San Francisco in September, both OpenAI and Meta's CFOs talked about how their companies are leaning on Google Cloud. Apple has even trained its AI on Google's Tensor Processing Units, Business Insider previously reported. But Google Cloud customers also want Nvidia's GPUs, so Google rents and offers Nvidia's competing chips to its customers via Google Cloud. Meta has struggled to catch up, with its Llama models falling short to the point Meta employees themselves are using competing AI models for their work.

Many of the deals are simply pragmatic, as several tech companies were caught off guard by the suddenness of the AI boom, and needed to lean on competitors and form less usual relationships to keep up.

""People recognize it's hard to build large language models, and not only hard, it's really expensive,"" says Rishi Jaluria, analyst at RBC. ""So how do you benefit from that without taking the financial burden on your balance sheet?""

Some companies may have also been haunted by the specter of the dotcom bubble. ""We saw what happened when people missed the internet. Sears could have been Amazon. Blackberry could have dominated enterprise mobile,"" says Jaluria. ""Everyone looks at that and nobody wants to miss this race.""

These entanglements carry longer-term strategic risks that some of these companies might have once tried to avoid. OpenAI is giving big business to cloud providers such as Google and Microsoft right now, but in doing so it's also learning how to build out its own data centers that might one day threaten business for the cloud giants.

Think of it like David and Goliath, if the giant was helping David design and build slingshots.

It can go the other way, too. But these may be tomorrow's problems. Right now, analysts say that it's in Nvidia's best interest to have as many players out there as possible, and OpenAI's best interest is to secure as much compute as it can while it's available. As for giants like Google and Meta, everyone is sitting at the poker table and not wanting to be the only one that doesn't go all-in.

""When you hear about any of these big participants talking about this right now, like Mark Zuckerberg or Sundar Pichai, the type of language they use is: the risk of underinvesting is bigger than the risk of overinvesting,"" says Luria.

We're also seeing AI drag in both new players and old incumbents who want a piece of the pie. ""Just the fact Oracle is going atomic on this thing is a huge deal,"" says Patrick Moorhead, chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. ""Ten years ago, I would have said: no way, they're a software company.""

Sometimes — surprise — sleeping with the enemy gets messy.

Nvidia's $100 billion investment in OpenAI includes plans to build out at least 10 gigawatts of AI data centers. That will require OpenAI purchasing millions of GPUs from … Nvidia. (OpenAI is also reportedly working on its own in-house chips that would eventually compete with Nvidia's. ""We do not require companies we invest in to use NVIDIA technology,"" an Nvidia spokesperson said when asked for comment). The deal was announced just days after OpenAI also signed a deal with Oracle to access $300 billion of the cloud company's compute power over five years.

Oracle is also currently buying billions of chips from Nvidia. Is this tale not tangled enough for you? In October, OpenAI also announced a deal to buy six gigawatts worth of GPUs from Nvidia chip rival AMD. In short, Nvidia is helping to prop up one of its biggest rivals.

You can see why there's been a lot of talk round-tripping, which has been a particular phenomenon of the cloud wars.

Here's how it often works. Company A invests in Company B, which in turn pays Company A for services such as cloud infrastructure. Company A makes some of its investment back, and is also able to show that demand for its services has grown.

An example of this was Amazon investing $4 billion in Anthropic, which in turn selected Amazon Web Services as its ""cloud provider of choice."" Here's where things get extra sticky though: Google is also an investor in Anthropic, meaning its investment is also tied to the performance of one of its biggest rivals.

Investors tend to not love these arrangements because they allow companies to juice their numbers and blur the difference between revenue that is organic and that is circulated back. Take an even more egregious example: Nvidia is selling its chips to smaller cloud providers in which it also invests, and then reportedly renting them back. So the startup gets to report an increase in revenue from its cloud business, which in turn boosts Nvidia's stake in the business.

Cue the Christian Bale in ""The Big Short"" concerned face.

But it's important to differentiate the ""healthy"" and ""unhealthy"" behavior, says Luria, who points to Nvidia-backed cloud company Coreweave as ""the most glaring example of bad behavior."" The company, which offers customers access to Nvidia's GPUs, has an ever-expanding contract with OpenAI, which uses Coreweave's cloud infrastructure. After Coreweave's IPO earlier this year fizzled, Nvidia inked a $6.3 billion agreement to buy back any unsold cloud capacity from Coreweave.

""Nvidia seeded Coreweave to create competition,"" he says. Then, ""they signed up as a customer."" Coreweave having a cost of capital of 10% on a 5% return on its assets was ""self-evidently value destructive,"" he says. ""It's like taking a margin loan from your broker to buy treasuries,"" he adds.

""Nvidia is an important partner to CoreWeave to be sure,"" a CoreWeave spokesperson said in an emailed statement. ""However, we do not receive any preferential treatment. We compete for supply like every other customer.""

Luria says the demand for AI was ""very real"" and he doesn't believe it's going away. ""There's not going to be a moment where we say oh this AI stuff is nonsense like we did about the metaverse.""

So if there is a bubble to burst at all, perhaps it will simply be one that hurts the ""unhealthy"" players. To take a Keynesian perspective on the current AI economy, if the ultimate customer demand is there — and right now, everyone seems to agree it is — then big players like Nvidia and Oracle priming the pump to stimulate the wider AI economy isn't necessarily a bad thing.

""This is just how the economy works,"" says Juluria. ""We're just seeing it in a very exaggerated way.""

The fact some AI companies are generating revenue from the technology is one reason some analysts are hopeful Silicon Valley's big tangled love-in will pay off.

""By no means am I saying there is no risk,"" Moorhead tells Business Insider. ""But the downstream impact of AI for companies that are doing it right is very positive.""

Speaking to CNBC last week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said his and other companies were building ""a brand-new industry called AI infrastructure.""

But the demand will ultimately need to be there to stop this intricately woven infrastructure from collapsing inward - to the tune of $1 trillion and counting. Right now, almost everything appears to be riding on Sam Altman, who has placed OpenAI squarely in the middle of this tangled web of deals and strange bedfellows.

""Sama has the power to crash the global economy for a decade or take us all to the promised land,"" wrote Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon in a note this month. ""And right now we don't know which is in the cards.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Why Silver Is Riskier Than Gold, According to Goldman Sachs","https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/commodities/gold-price-today-silver-riskier-investment-central-banks-goldman-sachs-2025-10","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 05:33:00 GMT","

Silver has stolen the spotlight in this year's precious-metals rally, soaring more than 70% and leaving gold's 50% gain behind.

On Monday, silver extended its run in early global trading, touching a record of $51.38 per ounce, according to LSEG data.

Gold also hit a record, climbing to around $4,060 per ounce after last week's run above $4,000, driven by expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts and safe-haven demand.

The latest bump in both metals came after President Donald Trump reignited a trade war with China by announcing an additional 100% tariff on imports from China.

The tariff shock added fuel to an already hot market. But in a note on Sunday, Goldman Sachs analysts urged caution over silver's rally. They said the white metal is likely to continue posting gains in the medium term due to likely Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.

""However, in the near term, we see significantly more volatility and downside price risk for silver than for gold, which is the only commodity supported by a structural central-bank bid,"" wrote the analysts.

Silver and gold prices have historically moved in tandem, but that relationship has shifted in recent years, largely because central-bank buying has pushed gold higher.

Silver, by contrast, is more cyclical due to its industrial uses — such as in solar panels — which makes it less reliable as a hedge, according to Goldman's analysts.

""Silver lacks the institutional and economic profile that supports gold. Silver is not recognized under IMF reserve frameworks, and has no material presence in modern central bank portfolios,"" wrote the analysts.

The analysts also dismissed the idea that high gold prices could prompt central banks to switch into silver instead.

""Central banks do not manage weight — they manage value. Gold reserves are held passively and are not used operationally,"" they wrote.

That means even if gold prices climb, policymakers don't seek cheaper substitutes. They simply hold fewer ounces to keep the same dollar value on their balance sheet.

Gold's physical traits also make it far more practical as a reserve asset. It's about ten times scarcer than silver, 80 times more valuable per ounce, and twice as dense — qualities that make it easier to store, transport, and secure.

""A $1 billion holding in gold fits in a suitcase; the same value in silver fills a full-size freight truck,"" the analysts added.

Without a central-bank bid to anchor silver prices, ""even a temporary pullback in investment flows could trigger a disproportionate correction,"" the analysts warned.

That's partly because the silver market is roughly nine times smaller than gold's, meaning every dollar of inflow packs far more punch.

That dynamic has been on full display in recent weeks: Silver prices have jumped more than 35% since late August.

The surge was further exaggerated by a liquidity squeeze in London — the global hub for physical silver trading — after inventories there dropped to multi-year lows.

In Goldman's view, silver behaves like a turbocharged version of gold. When investors pile into precious metals as a hedge against macro risk, silver tends to outperform. But when sentiment turns, it tends to crash harder.

""Without a central bank bid to anchor silver prices, even a temporary pullback in investment flows could trigger a disproportionate correction, as it would also unwind the London tightness that drove much of the recent rally,"" they wrote.

Federal prosecutors allege two MIT-educated brothers pulled off a cryptocurrency heist in a matter of seconds, stealing $25 million in a ""first-of-its-kind"" fraud scheme.

The brothers' defense? There was no fraud at all. All they did was outsmart some ""predatory"" automated trading bots. In the dog-eat-dog Wild West of crypto trading, it was fair game, not fraud.

That's what defense attorneys for Anton Peraire-Bueno, 25, and James Peraire-Bueno, 29, are set to argue when the brothers' criminal case heads to trial in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday.

If convicted of the conspiracy, wire fraud, and money laundering charges against them, the brothers — both highly educated in math and computer sciences — face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for each count.

The trial comes amid efforts by the Trump administration to bring more order to the cryptocurrency world, including through new regulations.

Prosecutors say the pair's 12-second Ethereum blockchain theft in April 2023 was ""meticulously planned"" over at least three months, right down to their online searches for ""how to wash crypto"" and ""top crypto lawyers.""

""Money launder statue of limitations,"" prosecutors say they searched at one point, misspelling statute.

The brothers, prosecutors allege, used ""bait transactions"" to find three victim traders and study their trading habits.

They then ""lured"" the victims' trading bots into a carefully set, fast-acting trap.

The trap was set with an irresistible bundle of crypto trades — the kind of transactions that the brothers correctly guessed the victim's bots would leap at the chance to profit from, prosecutors say.

The brothers then sprung the trap shut. Prosecutors say they exploited a software ""vulnerability"" that let them quickly glimpse their prey's private transaction information and ""tamper"" with the purchase in a classic bait-and-switch.

Instead of generating an anticipated windfall, the victims found that their $25 million had purchased a pile of effectively worthless, illiquid junk crypto.

Along the way, prosecutors say, the brothers hid their own identities — and the location of the heist's ill-gotten gain — through a web of shell companies, crypto addresses, and foreign crypto exchanges.

The heist itself, prosecutors say, was executed in just 12 seconds — the brief pause between the moment a crypto trade is made and when it is officially logged on the blockchain.

""Using the specialized skills developed during their education, as well as their expertise in cryptocurrency trading"" the brothers ""exploited the very integrity of the Ethereum blockchain,"" prosecutors said in a 19-page indictment.

The Peraire-Bueno brothers ""manipulated and tampered with the process and protocols by which transactions are validated and added to the Ethereum blockchain,"" the indictment alleges.

""In doing so, they fraudulently gained access to pending private transactions and used that access to alter transactions and obtain their victims' cryptocurrency.""

The brothers' lawyers have told prosecutors that they are not interested in even considering taking a plea, prosecutors revealed at a hearing on Thursday.

Instead, the defense is set to push back hard against the prosecution's allegations, at trial, before a jury.

""There's no central authority"" governing the Ethereum blockchain, Patrick Looby, who represents the elder brother, James, told US District Court Judge Jessica G. L Clarke during oral arguments in June.

""And there's no government regulations. Instead, economic incentives guide parties' behavior,"" Looby argued. Prosecutors, he said, are alleging conduct that the government has never sought to criminalize, he argued, including taking advantage of a software vulnerability or using a crypto transaction as ""bait.""

For fraud, ""there needs to be a promise to the victim,"" he also argued.

""Here, there is no alleged communication at all between the Peraire-Buenos and the traders. And for that reason as well, there's no alleged intent to defraud,"" he told the judge.

The so-called victims ""made very risky bets on a strategy that didn't pay out,"" he added. ""But there was nothing stolen and there was no theft, as that word would normally be used.""

The alleged victims lost their cryptocurrency ""through pre-programmed trades without ever interacting with the Peraire-Buenos, directly or indirectly,"" the defense attorneys argued earlier this year, in a failed motion to dismiss the indictment.

""Before this indictment, no Ethereum user would have understood that thwarting a predatory attempt by 'bots' engaged in market manipulation could lead to criminal charges,"" they wrote.

""No court has ever applied these statutes to similar transactions,"" they argued. ""And the Peraire-Buenos had no reason to know that their alleged conduct may be considered unlawful.""

Members of the defense team declined Business Insider's requests for comment on the case. A spokesperson for the prosecution did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Prospective jurors will be told on Tuesday that the trial may run into the first week of November.

As investors scramble to find the next big AI startup to fund, one VC firm got rid of its analysts and is instead using AI to help run deals.

Four-year-old Davidovs Venture Collective (DVC) — cofounded by married duo and general partners Marina Davidova and Nick Davidov — has launched a $75 million fund for Series A and B AI startups.

They say they fired their analysts, who typically help source and vet deals. Instead, DVC is tapping a network of 170 limited partners (LPs) — including founders and engineers from OpenAI, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla, SpaceX, and Perplexity — to source new deals, and it's arming them with AI tools.

DVC initially employed five part-time and full-time analysts, Davidova said, and it eliminated those roles more than a year ago in lieu of AI.

DVC's network of LPs now use AI agents to assist with deal memos, due diligence, and portfolio monitoring. The agents, which the LPs also helped build, can also identify founder needs and match them with relevant experts in the community.

The LPs will assist founders with hiring, sales, product development, and networking — in exchange for carried interest, a share of profits earned by investment managers. Davidov said that roughly 30% to 40% of the carried interest from each deal is shared with the community of investors, 30% to 40% goes to the partners, and the rest is divided between him and Davidova.

""We have really incredible talent that we would never be able to hire,"" Davidov said. ""They're the kind of people that Zuckerberg offers a hundred million dollars to, and they work for us for free on their weekends.""

While AI has made the firm more productive, it can't replace humans when it comes to assessing qualities like a founder's mental state, Davidova said. Other VC firms are also using AI to replace associates, and Point72 Ventures managing partner Sri Chandrasekar predicted that AI can reduce head count by over 50%, Business Insider previously reported.

The couple launched San Francisco-based DVC in 2021 with a network of 50 LPs.

Its seed fund has invested $21 million to date in 120 companies, including Perplexity, Etched, Thinking Machines Lab, and Higgsfield.

LPs backing DVC's new fund include TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington, Perplexity cofounder Denis Yarats, Zencoder founder Andrew Filev, and Semrush founder Oleg Shchegolev.

Along with launching the $75 million fund, DVC has onboarded two general partners — entrepreneurs Mel Guymon and Charles Ferguson — and named Meta AI product manager Alexey Rybak as a venture partner. Guymon will spearhead business sales support and governance, while Ferguson will focus on deal origination.

The new fund has secured $40 million and is finalizing the remaining amount with institutional investors, DVC said.

I met Richard Murby while waiting in a long line to get into OpenAI's DevDay conference in San Francisco this week. He's the director of business development at Devpost, which helps developers participate in hackathons. I asked Richard how he uses AI. Here are his thoughts, which have been edited for clarity and length.

What do you use AI for at work?

I use AI for three main goals: to help me do my best work, stay organized, and inspire new ideas.

I trained a Google Gemini model on my most effective emails, giving it a large sample of my writing and Devpost context. When drafting important messages, I collaborate with the model to ensure I'm expressing myself as I intend. It's still my tone and ideas, but the model helps me deliver consistently strong communication.

I also built a Google Gemini CLI ""Executive Assistant"" to replace my visual Kanban board with a markdown-based, conversational task manager. It integrates with my calendar and email via an MCP server, allowing Gemini to help prioritize tasks using real context from my schedule and inbox. It can even run Gemini's Deep Research on a task and feed results or draft emails directly into my notes. The best part is the ongoing dialogue — I see huge potential for expanding this system's functionality.

(CLI = Command Line Interface, a common tool developers use. Kanban boards are project-management tools offered by companies including Atlassian, Asana, and Monday.com.)

What's been your most impactful AI use?

Two stand out. First, Devpost's mission is AI distribution, helping organizations bring tools to developers worldwide. I couldn't advise clients effectively without using these tools daily myself. Second, my writing performance has improved dramatically. Every message I send now represents the clearest articulation of my ideas, thanks to AI's real-time feedback and pattern learning from my past successes.

What hasn't worked?

The hardest part of adopting AI is making time to experiment. You must deliberately think about which tasks can improve with AI and iterate. Some ideas don't pan out, but that's part of discovery. Hackathons work for this reason — they create space to test, fail, and learn, which is essential for developers.

What's your advice for non-technical people?

Don't worry about how AI works, just explore what it can do. Be descriptive in your prompts, ask thoughtful questions, and give context. Results may not come instantly, but as your experience and the AI's context grow, time savings and performance gains will follow.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Varun Agarwal, a founding employee at OffDeal, an AI investment bank. The following has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified his employment and academic history.

For a college graduate looking to work in finance, it's typically a no-brainer to pursue a career in investment banking.

What a career as an investment banker prepares you for is very enticing. You get great pay while working closely with executives from large public companies. You get to brush up on your soft skills while picking up technical skills like financial modeling.

The biggest lesson I learned from my time in investment banking was how to perform a wide variety of tasks efficiently. It also taught me how to ask the right questions when evaluating businesses. Working on deals honed my intellectual curiosity and sharpened my judgment when making investment decisions.

I considered starting my career at a tech startup instead. What held me back was my own aversion to risk. I studied at the University of Minnesota, where few people would take the plunge into entrepreneurship. Investment banking was the safer and prestigious path to take.

I figured that I didn't have any tangible skills to offer if I wanted to build or join a startup. Investment banking felt like a good way for me to build up my skills in the event that the right startup opportunity emerged.

I ended up working as an investment banker for three years, first at Piper Sandler and then at JPMorgan. Incidentally, both roles were based in the Bay Area, which helped expose me to the startup culture in Silicon Valley.

Seeing 21-year-olds start companies and raise millions of dollars was exhilarating. I thought to myself then, ""Hey, why can't I do that too? Why don't I join a startup and take a big risk myself?""

That's when I started speaking to founders and investors to map out the next steps of my career. One day, while scrolling through LinkedIn, I came across a post from Ori Eldarov, the founder of the AI native investment bank, OffDeal.

I was drawn to OffDeal's mission and its use of AI and software to address the exact pain points I faced as a junior banker at JPMorgan.

Their focus on small businesses resonated with me at a personal level. My mom runs her own dental practice and is a small-business owner. Growing up, I saw that most business brokers could not run a proper Wall Street-level process when handling transactions for small businesses. I knew I had to be a part of OffDeal.

What's unique about OffDeal is how each deal we handle is handled by a two-person team comprising one banker and one engineer. So far, I have been working on deals with OffDeal's founding software engineer, Luis Ruiz Morel. Both of us get to take a cut out of the deals we do.

We also work a lot faster. At bulge bracket banks like JPMorgan, a company valuation could take weeks or even months to complete.

At OffDeal, it can be completed in one to two days at most. I just need to work with Luis to conduct the valuation using our proprietary software. Gone are the days when I had to painstakingly plug my numbers into an Excel spreadsheet.

It's not just modeling. AI and technology have completely transformed my workflow as a banker.

In the past, I had to take notes manually when I sat in on Zoom calls. Now, AI can transcribe those calls for us.

And when it comes to putting together pitchbooks, I don't have to spend hours going back and forth with my managing director and clients to polish them. Instead, our AI agent makes those revisions automatically, which saves us a lot of time.

The upside to all this is that our bankers can do more deals and, more importantly, spend less time on grunt work.

When I was at JPMorgan, I usually worked on two to three live deals at once. Here at OffDeal, I can work on 10 to 11 deals at a time. I also get to spend a lot of time out on the road meeting with prospective buyers and sellers.

When it comes to starting your career, you can't go wrong with a job in traditional investment banking. It's still a great industry to go into.

But I think it has become less risky to join an AI company like OffDeal. It may have been a bigger risk before, but it is becoming increasingly clear that AI will have a huge impact on our lives.

There's a very small window of time where you can actually succeed and push your career forward in AI before it becomes a more mature industry. Becoming AI native and learning how to incorporate it into your workflow will pay huge dividends in the future.

Mark Cuban said on Sunday that employees, not just CEOs, should receive a proportional cut of their companies' success in the form of stock options.

Cuban was responding to several posts on X that criticized the growing wealth of top business executives compared to the average worker. He said the real issue wasn't the ever-increasing net worth of billionaires but how companies reward employees.

In his X post, Cuban wrote that billionaire wealth levels are soaring ""because the stock market has gone straight up.""

""You know who is funding the increase, particularly lately? Retail investors. 401ks,"" Cuban said.

""The better question is why are we not giving incentives to companies to require them to give shares in their companies to all employees, at the same percentage of cash earnings as the CEO?"" he added.

Cuban did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Cuban said in an earlier post that successful entrepreneurs derive less satisfaction from money ""once your LIQUID net worth becomes high enough.""

""The value of those dollars becomes much greater, to you, and so many others, when you use your business or other expertise to help others. That is the greater reward,"" Cuban wrote.

""Compassion and capitalism, not greed, are what can make this country far greater,"" he added.

Cuban has long espoused the importance of companies divvying up the spoils with their rank-and-file employees.

In 2020, Cuban said on the ""This is Working"" podcast that companies looking to emerge stronger after the COVID-19 pandemic should give their employees stock.

""You will get more from your employees, and they will be more committed if you share equity immediately in a meaningful way, so that everybody rises up,"" Cuban said.

""No entrepreneur can do this alone. You need every single employee committed to helping you get through this, so recognize that. Reward them for it,"" he added.

Last year, Cuban said in an X post that ""300 out of 330 employees"" at his streaming company, Broadcast.com, became millionaires after he sold it to Yahoo for $5.7 billion.

He also shared profits with his employees at his first business, Microsolutions, a software company. After selling the company for $6 million to CompuServe, Cuban said he shared 20% of the sales proceeds with 80 employees.

""In every business I've sold, I've paid out bonuses to every employee that was there more than a year,"" Cuban wrote on X in June 2024.

Last month, the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations said in a report that S&P 500 CEOs earned 268 times as much as their median worker in 2023. The average CEO made around 30 times what the average worker made in 1978.

In September, Tesla proposed a new $1 trillion pay package for its CEO, Elon Musk, if he could raise the EV giant's market cap to $8.5 trillion by 2035. Tesla's current market cap is around $1.3 trillion.

""If he performs, if he hits the super ambitious milestones that are in the plan, then he gets equity — it's 1% for each half a trillion dollars of market cap, plus operational milestones he has to hit in order to do that,"" Tesla chair Robyn Denholm said in a CNBC interview about the proposal.

This week, America will get an off-brand clue of how the economy is faring as earnings season heats up.

However, a trio of economists said it won't replace key data that isn't being published during the government shutdown.

""If the shutdown continues, private data and earnings calls offer useful clues — especially around company performance relative to expectations,"" Gregory Daco, EY's chief economist, said. ""But they're no substitute for broader and more consistent government data.""

Independent economist Aaron Terrazas said earning calls can inform people about the direction of the economy, but they are not the same as government data, and people may have to read between the lines for what's being said.

""There's a little bit of a guessing game around how much of this is unique to the company, how much of this is unique to the sector, how much of this is the polish and spin that inevitably accompanies talking to investors,"" he said.

On the other hand, the big federal data releases tend to be more open and straightforward. Terrazas said the government has vetted and transparent methodologies for its data — people can visit the Bureau of Labor Statistics website to find a whole page on calculations.

Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate, said bank CEOs are prone to saying in earnings calls that the consumer is doing well, but that has some caveats: consumers still need to buy necessities, and some are having a harder time than others. That means these calls may not capture the full picture of consumer spending.

""Earnings calls will help to give us color, "" Hamrick said, ""but it doesn't give us that fully fleshed out view that things like the CPI and the monthly employment situation read.""

The Bureau of Labor Statistics has mostly folded up shop during the shutdown. Data reports haven't been released since October 1, and new data collection isn't happening. The jobs report — arguably the most important economic data release of the month — wasn't published on its planned date of October 3.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Friday that the consumer price index inflation report will be released on October 24 instead of its originally planned date of October 15. The CPI report is especially important ahead of the Fed's next rate decision later this month. The September data is also needed for Social Security's annual cost-of-living adjustment.

Private data has helped fill in some of the gaps in understanding the state of the job market in September, but the findings were mixed. ADP's analysis showed a loss of 32,000 private-sector jobs, while Revelio Labs found the US added 60,000 nonfarm jobs.

""We're all highly reliant on information about the performance of the US economy, and the federal data is the gold standard measuring that performance,"" Hamrick said.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics' jobs report is closely watched to see how the workforce is evolving. It helps the Federal Reserve make its interest rate decisions, helps economists understand changes to the labor force, wage growth, and unemployment, and helps job seekers identify industries that are hiring more than others.

""It's like air traffic control for the economy,"" Daco said. ""Planes can't land safely without FAA staff — and businesses can't make sound investment or hiring decisions in a data fog. Consumers, too, lose confidence.""

This as-told-to essay is based on conversations with Izabela Oquendo, a 35-year-old mother of two who moved her family from Connecticut to Alicante, Spain. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

On the surface, our life was great.

My husband and I both had thriving businesses. I was an accountant, and he was a home inspector. We had a lot of external things that defined success, like two brand-new cars sitting in the driveway, a beautiful 2,000-square-foot two-story house that we spent a lot of time renovating to be perfect.

From the outside, it looked like we had it all together. But the truth is, we weren't really happy.

We went through some personal turmoil and had falling-outs with our closest friends. And in 2023, my father passed away, and my mother, who is from Poland, moved back there to take care of her sick brother. We felt really isolated.

Eventually, we started thinking about moving somewhere new — somewhere near my mother with warm weather. We're beach people, so we landed on Spain.

In January 2024, we took a trip there to experience it firsthand and loved it so much that we knew it was right for us.

Before making the leap to Spain, we sold our home and auctioned off everything in it — furniture, kitchenware, and all the little knickknacks we'd accumulated over the years. We also sold our other real-estate properties for a decent profit.

We also decided to fulfill a lifelong dream of traveling around the US in an RV. I wanted to test if I could take my business on the road and reconnect as a family, knowing that in Spain, with the language barrier and a brand-new environment, it would be just us for a while.

We left in July 2024 and returned to Connecticut in 2025, hitting Tennessee and Kentucky and looping back through Michigan, South Dakota, Washington, Montana, California, Nevada, Arizona, and Texas. Luckily, our kids were young enough to love every minute of it.

When we got back to Connecticut, we rented a small apartment in a beach community for about $2,000 a month while we waited four months to move to Spain.

By the time we landed in Spain in May, we had pared everything down to just two big suitcases, two carry-ons, and nine shipped boxes. That was everything we owned.

I have Polish citizenship by descent, so my children and I came to Spain as EU citizens. My husband obtained his residency through Spain's family reunification visa program.

We live in Alicante, just past Valencia. It's a really up-and-coming area with lots of new apartment buildings and constant construction. There are tons of people, many from other parts of Europe, so we hear many different languages and see plenty of non-Spanish restaurants.

I wouldn't necessarily describe it as the quintessential ""Spanish"" experience, which is a bit disappointing. If we could do it over, we'd probably choose somewhere that feels more traditionally Spanish.

We're in a 1,500-square-foot apartment with three bedrooms and two bathrooms. It's decent, but we're not used to apartment living; we've always had a house since the kids were born, so keeping things quiet, especially with little ones running around, can be tough.

We do want to buy a house within the next few months. We're actually thinking of having my mom coming to live with us at least part time when we have more space. The areas we're looking to buy are in a lot more traditionally Spanish areas.

One city we're particularly interested in is Calpe. It's just beautiful and super cute. There are lots of restaurants and shops, and there's even a beach there.

I've been surprised by the cost of living in Spain. I thought it was going to be significantly less, and it's really not. The prices for goods and services have gone up over the past two years from when we first started thinking about moving.

Our apartment costs about the same as the one we had in Connecticut, and we're spending about the same on groceries as we did in the States.

It's also been difficult to communicate with the locals. My husband speaks Spanish, but the dialect here is different. We're getting by, though.

One of my biggest fears about moving to Spain was how my kids would handle learning the language and assimilating into the culture.

They definitely notice they're in a new country. When we arrived, we enrolled them in Spanish lessons to give them a foundation. Of course, they're still learning the language.

My daughter is very social, but when she first started school, it was hard for her to make friends — something she'd never struggled with before. It's because she can't just walk up and start talking to them; the other kids don't speak the same language. That was tough, but an English-language camp we also enrolled her in has helped a lot.

My advice for parents moving their children to a new country is to be gentle with the process. Kids are resilient and adapt to almost anything. I grew up with immigrant parents, so I remember this from my own upbringing. I think if you provide a stable structure and show up consistently, the external stuff matters much less.

One of the main things we wanted in moving to Spain was a slower life. In Connecticut, my husband and I were constantly working — passing each other during the day and collapsing at night. It was a grind we weren't enjoying.

I am working here, but a lot less. I continue to do accounting and bookkeeping for my US clients, and am transitioning into more healing and therapeutic work. In June, I published a book I started working on while traveling the States in our RV, about finding your life purpose, which deeply influenced our move.

A typical day for us involves my husband taking my daughter to school in the morning, and me starting bookkeeping.

I usually work half a day, pick my daughter up at two, and we have lunch. In the afternoons, we go on walks or go to the grocery store, and then we just hang out for the rest of the day. It's much slower than the 10-hour days I was used to working.

I feel like our happiness is less dependent on our accomplishments now. Before, it was always grinding for the next thing — a bigger house, a nicer car, a promotion, more clients.

Now that I'm not striving for external milestones, I feel real happiness. Now, the things I strive for are within my family and things that make me truly happy. Money is not at the top of that list anymore.

If you think your burger, burrito, or cold brew already costs too much, brace yourself — restaurant groups say they would have to raise prices by 30% just to stay profitable amid rising costs.

In a new survey from the restaurant management software company Toast, nearly half of restaurant operators said they plan to increase menu prices if inflation, tariffs, and labor costs continue to climb.

The National Restaurant Association estimates that to maintain a modest 5% profit margin, the average restaurant would need to raise prices by 30.3% — a move many owners fear would scare customers away.

That's bad news for diners, who're already facing increased costs for favorites including burgers, burritos, and coffee. Toast's menu price monitor, released in August, found orders of wings and pints of beer were the only tracked items that beat the nation's current 2.9% rate of inflation, increasing 2.3% and 2.4%, respectively.

Business Insider reported in September that grocery prices have sharply increased in recent months, reaching their highest level since August 2022, and inflation now exceeds the Federal Reserve's 2% target.

The price hikes are tied to President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff strategy, which a Yale economist told Business Insider in April is expected to cost the average consumer about $3,800 this year — and that was before Trump renewed trade tensions with China on Friday, announcing a new round of tariffs on the country's imports.

Although the tariffs on imports from China primarily affect items such as electronics and apparel, they also encompass a wide range of fish, snack foods, and spices.

""While tariffs can be enacted with a pen stroke, it takes years to rewire global supply chains,"" John Lash, group vice president of product strategy at connected supply chain platform e2open, told Business Insider in May. ""How this all plays out will be a complex formula full of surprises, with the general theme of higher consumer prices.""

For the restaurant industry, which already operates on thin margins, the higher cost of ingredients is not just an inconvenience — it's approaching a crisis point. Not only are their own food and labor costs higher, but consumers are also pulling back on spending, dining out less, and seeking promotional deals when they do.

National Restaurant Association President & CEO Michelle Korsmo said in an August statement that operators are reluctant to raise prices because it makes consumers even less likely to dine out, further jeopardizing the industry, but they ""may have no choice"" given their increasing costs.

So go ahead and savor your $14 burger — it might be the cheapest one you'll see for a while — or opt for wings and a beer, as the last bargains left on the menu.

Tesla's Cybertruck sales have more than halved since last year. 

The EV giant sold around 5,400 of Elon Musk's ""apocalypse-proof"" pickup trucks last quarter, down 62.6% from the same period last year, according to data from Cox Automotive.

That fall came despite both Tesla and the broader EV market reporting record quarterly sales as buyers rushed to purchase electric vehicles before the federal tax credit expired.

Back in 2023, Musk said Tesla could end up making 250,000 Cybertrucks a year. Nearly two years after its launch, the stainless steel-clad pickup is nowhere near that lofty target, with Tesla having sold around 16,000 Cybertrucks so far in 2025.

The futuristic electric pickup is also lagging behind Ford's F-150 Lightning, its main rival. Ford sold 10,000 Lightnings in the third quarter, according to Cox data.

Tesla has struggled to find a market for the Cybertruck. Early versions of the electric truck went for around $100,000 when it launched in November 2023, well above the $39,990 starting price Musk advertised at its 2019 unveiling.

The cheapest Cybertruck on sale still costs nearly $80,000. Tesla previously scrapped a $70,000 rear-wheel drive version with fewer features.

The Cybertruck's highly distinctive design has also made it a prime target for protests against Musk's political views.

Owners told Business Insider earlier this year that they had dealt with vandalism, graffiti, and harassment amid widespread backlash over the billionaire's work at DOGE.

The truck's poor sales performance has prompted Tesla to undertake a quiet rebrand.

Business Insider's Grace Kay previously reported that the company had scrapped the truck's science-fiction marketing in an attempt to position the Cybertruck as a working man's vehicle.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment, sent outside normal working hours.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Meredith Whittaker, the president of Signal, based in New York and Paris. It's been edited for length and clarity.

In July 2006, I accepted a job offer at Google that brought me into tech after an arts and humanities education. I climbed the ladder at Google to found Google's Open Research Group, working on issues related to measurement, privacy, and AI.

In 2016, I cofounded the AI Now Research Institute at NYU, the first university-based research institute to examine broader social and political economic considerations surrounding AI.

Business Insider's Power Hours series gives readers an inside look at how powerful leaders in business structure their workday. See more stories from the series here, or reach out to editor Lauryn Haas to share your daily routine.

I next joined the Federal Trade Commission as Lina Kahn's chief AI advisor, where I stayed for under a year. After that, I joined Signal because I had met its founder, Moxie Marlinspike, 10 years ago on a smaller open-source project called WindSignal.

When Signal became its own foundation in 2018, I joined the board and became its president in September 2022.

Here's what a typical day looks like.

First, I grab a protein drink and take a shower. I then make my coffee. I have an AeroPress with a hand grinder, and I make a very strong brewed coffee with cardamom.

While my coffee is steeping, I do little tasks around the house, like taking out the trash. I put on some dance music to get the energy moving in the house. I also practice yoga every day, with no exceptions; it's my non-negotiable.

I sit down wherever I'm working that day, which is always from home as we've always been a remote company, and go through emails and notifications. Signal messages are our main platform for communication, so I start pulling things into my to-do list to better understand what I'm facing that day.

I'm based between New York and Paris. Depending on my other engagements, I travel about half the time.

My morning routine is usually no more than an hour and a half. I don't really think of it as a sacrifice to keep my morning intact. I'm not ""being disciplined,"" I'm practicing a consistent and helpful ritual that supports me over time.

I open the Financial Times, Wall Street Journal, and any new briefings from the AI Now Institute. Recently, I've been closely examining the brass tacks and implementation details of AI agents, as they're being rolled out and pose a significant privacy threat to Signal.

I'll also examine some of the broader security and privacy concerns surrounding AI systems in general, engaging with the work of people like Heidy Khlaaf, the research director at AI Now.

I've been writing a book about AI, with a focus on privacy, in bits and pieces in the mornings, too.

We also have a heartbeat meeting, which is a sync meeting for my office to check in on everyone's current projects, ensure that everything is moving forward, and that communication lines are clear.

We have weekly meetings with bigger updates, and we monitor the progress with different clients, addressing any bugs that arise.

Since Signal Gate, we've had numerous conversations with people who are reaching out to understand Signal's capabilities and how it differs from competitors like WhatsApp or iMessage.

I have a particular smoothie recipe that's high in protein and low in the glycemic index.

I eat snacks throughout my workday, such as brown rice, a boiled egg, kimchi, or a baked yam with avocado and arugula — something fairly simple to keep the nutrition going.

Afternoons are the busiest time for talking and catching up. I join a weekly leadership meeting and schedule one-on-ones. I'll also talk to our chair and board.

Our email inboxes are vacant because we use Signal. We do use email for scheduling, and people can email us on different lists or reach out to us directly, but they're primarily where our administrative staff, my EA, and others manage scheduling with the outside world.

Given that we're dealing with very sensitive topics, we prefer Signal Desktop or Signal Mobile with video for calls across our entire organization.

I love to cook, so between meetings, I'll do little bits of prep work. Whenever I'm done, I can have a very nice dinner ready to eat. After dinner, I'll clean up a bit and listen to some music, a podcast, or an audio service that reads academic papers to me.

I enjoy podcasts with smart people and listen to a lot of them — mainly in tech, geopolitics, science, and business. I've been listening to Amy Westervelt's podcast ""Drilled,"" which examines the history and state of climate science and the oil industry's relationship with it.

I usually do night yoga, even though it's not always advised to do yoga after dinner. That's the only time I have available.

I also check my phone throughout the night, making sure to answer any incoming messages. I'm not a purist, but I do feel the weight of the responsibility to make sure my people get a reply and that I'm not missing something.

The moment that makes me feel most drained is any moment that involves attempting to do a quick admin task, such as logging into a new account, checking a dashboard, or downloading a conference app, or the like, that then turns into an hour of debugging some redirect loop or a broken two-factor process.

Suddenly, it's been an hour, and I'm on the phone with some Kafkaesque AI-bot customer support, and I haven't even started the ""real"" work that the admin task was supposed to let me commence.

Why, I ask myself at this point, does so much tech insist on being so shitty?

Unless there's something truly urgent, I'm not pedal to the metal all weekend. It's more casual, and I'm less connected to the day-to-day heartbeat of business.

I love cooking, so I'll do some grocery shopping and go to the farmers' market. I slow shop to see what's available and how pretty the market is.

I read a lot on the weekend, and I have personal projects and personal scholarship that make me really happy when I can get some space to dig in.

I often do a yoga workshop on the weekend. I also love dancing and hanging out with friends. Sometimes, I go to the opera.

Paris is a glorious city, and so is New York City. Walking out the door, you feel like you unwrapped a special package. I sometimes act like a tourist and explore.

In this article

Charlie Kawwas, president of the semiconductor solutions group at Broadcom, on Monday said that OpenAI is not the mystery $10 billion customer that it announced during its earnings call in September.

Kawwas appeared on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" with OpenAI's president, Greg Brockman, to discuss their plans to jointly build and deploy 10 gigawatts of custom artificial intelligence accelerators.

The deal was largely expected after analysts were quick to point to OpenAI as Broadcom's potential new $10 billion partner. But after the companies officially unveiled their plans on Monday, Kawwas said OpenAI does not fit that description.

""I would love to take a $10 billion [purchase order] from my good friend Greg,"" Kawwas said. ""He has not given me that PO yet.""

Broadcom did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for additional comment.

OpenAI has been on an AI infrastructure dealmaking blitz as the company looks to scale up its compute capacity to meet anticipated demand. The startup, which is valued at $500 billion, has inked multi-billion dollar agreements with Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia and CoreWeave in recent weeks.

Broadcom does not disclose its large web-scale customers, but analysts have pointed to Google, Meta and TikTok parent ByteDance as three of its large clients. During its quarterly call with analysts in September, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said a fourth large customer had put in orders for $10 billion in custom AI chips.

The order increased Broadcom's forecast for AI revenue next year, which is when shipments will begin, Tan said during the call.

OpenAI and Broadcom have been working together for the last 18 months, and they will begin deploying racks of custom-designed chips starting late next year, the companies said Monday. The project will be completed by 2029.

""By building our own chip, we can embed what we've learned from creating frontier models and products directly into the hardware, unlocking new levels of capability and intelligence,"" Brockman said in a release.

Broadcom and OpenAI have made their partnership official.

The two companies said Monday that they're jointly building and deploying 10 gigawatts of custom artificial intelligence accelerators as part of a broader effort across the industry to scale AI infrastructure. Financial terms weren't disclosed.

Broadcom shares climbed 9% following news of the deal.

While the companies have been working together for 18 months, they're now going public with plans to develop and deploy racks of OpenAI-designed chips starting late next year. OpenAI has announced massive deals in recent weeks with Nvidia, Oracle and Advanced Micro Devices, as it tries to secure the capital and compute needs necessary for its historically ambitious AI buildout plans.

""These things have gotten so complex you need the whole thing,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a podcast with OpenAI and Broadcom executives that the companies released along with the news.

The systems include networking, memory and compute — all customized for OpenAI's workloads and built on Broadcom's Ethernet stack. By designing its own chips, OpenAI can bring compute costs down and stretch its infrastructure dollars further. Industry estimates peg the cost of a 1-gigawatt data center at roughly $50 billion, with $35 billion of that typically allocated to chips — based on Nvidia's current pricing.

The Broadcom deal provides ""a gigantic amount of computing infrastructure to serve the needs of the world to use advanced intelligence,"" Altman said. ""We can get huge efficiency gains, and that will lead to much better performance, faster models, cheaper models — all of that.""

Broadcom has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the generative AI boom, as hyperscalers have been snapping up its custom AI chips, which the company calls XPUs. Broadcom doesn't name its large web-scale customers, but analysts have said dating back to last year that its first three clients were Google, Meta and TikTok parent ByteDance.

Shares of Broadcom are up over 50% this year after more than doubling in 2024, and the company's market cap has surpassed $1.5 trillion. The stock popped more than 9% last month after the chipmaker said on its earnings call that it had secured a new $10 billion customer, which analysts claimed as OpenAI.

However, Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom's semiconductor solutions group, said on Monday that OpenAI is not the mystery $10 billion customer disclosed in the report. 

OpenAI President Greg Brockman said the company used its own models to accelerate chip design and improve efficiency.

""We've been able to get massive area reductions,"" he said in the podcast. ""You take components that humans have already optimized and just pour compute into it, and the model comes out with its own optimizations.""

Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said in the same conversation that OpenAI is the company building ""the most-advanced"" frontier models.

""You continue to need compute capacity — the best, latest compute capacity — as you progress in a road map towards a better and better frontier model and towards superintelligence,"" he said. ""If you do your own chips, you control your destiny.""

Altman indicated that 10 gigawatts is just the beginning.

""Even though it's vastly more than the world has today, we expect that very high-quality intelligence delivered very fast and at a very low price — the world will absorb it super fast and just find incredible new things to use it for,"" he said.

OpenAI today operates on just over 2 gigawatts of compute capacity.

Altman said that's been enough to scale ChatGPT to where it is today, as well as develop and launch video creation service Sora and do a lot of AI research. But demand is soaring.

OpenAI has announced roughly 33 gigawatts of compute commitments over the past three weeks across partnerships with Nvidia, Oracle, AMD and Broadcom.

""If we had 30 gigawatts today with today's quality of models,"" he added, ""I think you would still saturate that relatively quickly in terms of what people would do.""

In this article

Shares of Bloom Energy soared Monday after striking a deal with Brookfield Asset Management to install fuel cells in artificial intelligence data centers.

Brookfield will spend up to $5 billion to deploy Bloom Energy's technology, the first investment in its strategy to support big AI data centers with power and computing infrastructure. Bloom's fuel cells are ""fuel-flexible"" and can run on natural gas, biogas or hydrogen, the company says.

Brookfield and Bloom are collaborating to design and build what they are calling ""AI factories"" around the the world, including a site in Europe that will be unveiled before the end of the year.

Shares of Bloom Energy jumped more than 20%. Bloom's fuel cells provide on-site power that can be quickly installed because they don't rely on a connection to the electric grid.

Bloom has already positioned hundreds of megawatts of fuel cells through deals with utilities including American Electric Power and data center developers such as Equinix and Oracle, according to the company.

The AI industry's data center plans are growing in scale. Nvidia and OpenAI, for example, recently announced a partnership that aims to build 10 gigawatts of data centers, equivalent to the power consumed by New York City at the height of summer.

But AI companies' plans are butting up against an aging U.S. electric grid that is often slow to provide additional power capacity. Data centers also threaten to raise electricity prices for residential customers.

Deploying power solutions ""behind-the-meter,"" or off the grid, ""are essential to closing the grid gap for AI factories,"" said Brookfield's global head of AI infrastructure, Sikander Rashid, in a release announcing the deal.

""AI infrastructure must be built like a factory—with purpose, speed, and scale,"" Bloom Energy CEO KR Sridhar said in the release.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC last week that the artificial intelligence industry will need to build power off the electric grid to quickly meet demand and protect consumers from rising electricity prices.

""Data center self-generated power could move a lot faster than putting it on the grid and we have to do that,"" Huang said.

U.S. President Donald Trump said Monday that he's considering sending Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, saying it would provide ""a new step of aggression"" in its war with Russia.

As the president travelled on Air Force One to the Middle East on Monday, first to Israel and then Egypt for talks on finalizing a peace deal for Gaza, when asked if he would send Tomahawks to Ukraine, Trump replied ""we'll see... I may.""

He also signaled he could use the supply of Tomahawks to pressure Russia to end the war, telling reporters: ""I might say 'Look: if this war is not going to get settled, I'm going to send them Tomahawks.'

""The Tomahawk is an incredible weapon, very offensive weapon. And honestly, Russia does not need that,"" he said, according to comments reported by Sky News.

Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy have discussed the potential provision on Tomahawk missiles, which would allow Ukraine to launch robust counter-attacks against Russia.

But the U.S. president is keeping his cards close to his chest regarding whether he will actually send the missiles to Ukraine. He said Monday that he would call Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the matter. No such call has been scheduled, as yet, according to comments from the Kremlin on Monday.

Russia has warned that any provision of long-range cruise missiles to Kyiv would be seen as a ""serious escalation.""

Tomahawks are subsonic cruise missiles and can strike targets precisely from 1,000 miles away, even in heavily defended airspace, according to U.S. manufacturer Raytheon.

Designed for striking high value or heavily defended land targets, Tomahawks can be fired from ground launchers but are typically launched from ships or submarines, and can be armed with conventional or nuclear warheads. The missiles don't come cheap, with a reported average cost of $1.3 million each.

First developed in the 1970s, they are used by the U.S. military and have been purchased — or with agreements to purchase — by a number of allies, including the U.K., Japan, Australia and the Netherlands.

The latest version, called the Block IV Tactical Tomahawk, or TACTOM, has a data link that allows it to switch targets while in flight. It can loiter for hours and change course instantly on command.

Raytheon notes that U.S. and Allied militaries have flight tested the GPS-enabled Tomahawk over 550 times and used it in an operational environment more than 2,350 times. Its most recent use came in 2024, when the U.S. and British navies launched Tomahawk missiles at Houthi rebel sites in Yemen.

Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last week that Moscow's leadership was waiting to see the specifics of any deal to supply Tomahawks, but was scathing about the prospect.

""This would be a serious escalation which, however, wouldn't change the situation for the Kyiv regime on the front lines. But it's important to understand that, leaving aside the details, we're talking about nuclear capable missiles. Therefore, this is truly a serious escalation.""

On Monday, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said that any Tomahawk supply could end badly for everyone, including Trump. He noted that it's impossible to distinguish between Tomahawk missiles carrying nuclear warheads and conventional ones after they are launched.

""How should Russia respond? Exactly!"" Medvedev said on Telegram, in comments translated by Reuters, seeming to hint that Moscow's response would be a nuclear one.

Asked on Monday about Trump's comments that he would talk to Putin about Tomahawks, Peskov said ""there are no clear agreements on a phone call.""

Ukraine and its supporters say the supply of Tomahawks would greatly enhance the country's strike capabilities and the threat it poses to Russian assets, such as military bases, energy infrastructure and logistics hubs.

Supplying Tomahawks could, as such, be another push factor that brings Russia to the negotiating table with Ukraine and its Western allies, particularly the U.S., wanting to see an end to a war that Moscow began in February 2022.

Ukrainian leader Zelenskyy said in his nightly address Sunday that Kyiv was working closely with the White House to strengthen its defensive capabilities, including its long-range capabilities.

""We see and hear that Russia fears the possibility of the United States providing us with Tomahawks. It is a signal that this kind of pressure can be effective in achieving peace. President Trump and I agreed that our teams and our military will be working on all the matters we discussed,"" he said.

As Trump looks to cement an end of hostilities between Israel and Hamas, his attention could well turn back to Russia, with the president already signaling waning patience with Putin.

In addition, Trump's publicized coveting of the Nobel Peace Prize (which he missed out on this year) could help spur the president on to deliver peace in Ukraine.

""That Trump did not get the Nobel peace prize this time could turn into good news for Europe. He wants the prize. But he still has to earn it,"" Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, noted Monday.

""If Trump were to put enough pressure on Putin to stop the war against Ukraine, the U.S. president would indeed be the top candidate for the prize next year ... Media reports about potential deliveries of U.S. Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine suggest that Trump is getting tougher with Putin. That would be a start,"" Schmieding said.

In this article

JPMorgan Chase on Monday said it is launching a decade-long plan to help finance and take direct stakes in companies it considers crucial to U.S. interests.

The bank said in a statement it would invest up to $10 billion into companies in four areas: defense and aerospace, ""frontier"" technologies including artificial intelligence and quantum computing, energy technology including batteries, and supply chain and advanced manufacturing.

The money is part of a broader effort, dubbed the Security and Resiliency Initiative, in which JPMorgan said it will finance or facilitate $1.5 trillion in funding for companies it identifies as crucial. It said the total amount is 50% more than a previous plan.

""It has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing — all of which are essential for our national security,"" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in the release.

As the biggest American bank by assets and a Wall Street juggernaut, JPMorgan was already raising funds and lending money to companies in those industries. But the move helps organize the company's activities around national interests at a time of heightened tensions between the U.S. and China.

On Friday, markets tumbled as President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on Chinese imports after the major U.S. trading partner tightened export controls on rare earths.

In the release, Dimon said the U.S. needs to ""remove obstacles"" including excessive regulations, ""bureaucratic delay"" and ""partisan gridlock.""

JPMorgan said that within the four major areas, there were 27 specific industries it would look to support with advice, financing and investments. That includes areas as diverse as nanomaterials, autonomous robots, spacecraft and space launches, and nuclear and solar power.

""Our security is predicated on the strength and resiliency of America's economy,"" Dimon said. The project ""includes efforts like ensuring reliable access to life-saving medicines and critical minerals, defending our nation, building energy systems to meet AI-driven demand and advancing technologies like semiconductors and data centers.""

The bank said it would hire an unspecified numbers of bankers and create an external advisory council to support its initiative.

In a call with reporters, Dimon said that the project was an internal effort that started a few months ago, not something done with the Trump administration. Dimon also said that even while pumping up their financing efforts by 50% over a decade, he didn't expect ""lower-than-commercial returns"" on the initiative.

""Obviously, we work closely with people in the government, which we've always done, but this is a JPMorgan effort,"" Dimon said.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Stocks tumbled on Friday after President Donald Trump threatened a ""massive increase of Tariffs"" on Chinese goods. Trump's comments came after Beijing expanded its export restrictions on rare earth materials — a move Trump described as ""hostile"" in a social media post.

Here's what to know:

JPMorgan Chase announced this morning that it is officially launching its plan to take stakes in companies it views as core to U.S. interests and national security.

The bank said it will invest as much as $10 billion into companies across several categories, including defense and aerospace and energy technology. CNBC's Hugh Son notes that the plan is part of JPMorgan's broader Security and Resiliency Initiative, which will involve the bank financing or facilitating $1.5 trillion in funding for companies it sees as crucial to U.S. interests.

Shares of the bank popped 1.4% in premarket trading.

The Trump administration said it began laying off federal workers on Friday, as the government shutdown nears its third week will no end in sight. Trump, who had previously warned that the shutdown would lead to permanent reductions in the federal workforce, said ""a lot"" of government employees would be cut.

Over the weekend, the president said his administration had ""identified funds"" to pay military members if the shutdown continues through Oct. 15 — when active duty members of the armed services are scheduled to receive their next paycheck.

Vice President JD Vance meanwhile took aim at the Affordable Care Act credits that have been the lightening-rod issue in Congress' funding stalemate. Vance said Sunday that there is ""a lot of waste and fraud"" in the Obamacare subsidies, and that the White House wants to ensure that ""the tax credits go to the people who need them.""

Gen Z may not be shopping at department stores, but baby boomers are. Just look at Macy's and its subsidiary Bloomingdale's, for example: Data shows a majority of their shoppers are older than 45.

Boomers may be pleased with in-store perks like lax return policies and promotional events, and loyalty from the generation could help buoy department stores amid the rise of online retailers.

But when it comes to winning over younger shoppers, department stores' popularity among baby boomers may end up be what's getting in their way. As one retail adviser put it, the mindset for younger consumers is: ""I don't want to shop where my mother shops.""

Gold prices scaled to another record high on Monday as investors revved up their safe-haven bets after U.S. President Donald Trump renewed tariff threats against China, while expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts added to the metal's allure.

Silver also jumped to an all-time peak, tracking gold's rally.

Spot gold was up 1.64% to a record $4,083.42 per ounce. U.S. gold futures for December delivery surged 2.55% to $4,102.60.

Trump on Friday reignited the U.S. trade war with China, threatening 100% tariffs on Chinese goods imports into the United States and announcing new export controls on critical software by November 1 in a reprisal against Beijing curbing critical mineral exports.

However, Trump, posting on Truth Social on Sunday, wrote: ""Don't worry about China, it will all be fine!""

Trade tensions remain a focus for markets, said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo, adding that ""while they have eased again between the U.S. and China, the 100% additional tariff threat remains.""

""Ongoing strong investment and central bank demand should further support gold. We target a move to $4,200/oz,"" he added.

Spot silver jumped 2.22% to $51.39/oz, after hitting $51.70/oz, driven by similar factors as gold alongside tightness in the spot market.

Goldman Sachs said on Sunday that silver prices were expected to rise in the medium term due to private investment flows, but warned of heightened near-term volatility and downside risks compared to gold.

Bank of America on Monday raised its price forecasts for precious metals, lifting its 2026 outlook for gold to $5,000 an ounce and for silver to $65/oz. BofA is the first major bank to raise its gold price forecast to $5,000/oz for 2026.

On a technical basis, gold's and silver's Relative Strength Index stands at 80 and 83, respectively, indicating the metals are overbought.

Non-yielding bullion has gained 53% year-to-date, driven by geopolitical risks, alongside strong central bank gold-buying, exchange-traded funds inflows, Fed rate cut expectations and economic uncertainties stemming from tariffs.

On the monetary policy front, traders are now pricing in a 25-basis-point cut each in October and December, with a 95% and 79.8% chance, respectively.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell has a chance to offer his guidance on monetary policy when he speaks on the economic outlook at the NABE annual meeting on Tuesday.

Several Fed officials are scheduled to speak throughout the week.

Platinum, rose 3.76% to $1,645.57and palladium gained 2.92% to $1,446.59.

BAGHDAD — Palestinian militant group Hamas released the first seven surviving Israeli hostages on Monday, marking the first stage of a ceasefire deal brokered with the help of U.S. President Donald Trump.

According to a statement from the Israel Defense Forces, the hostages were handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross in Gaza.

Another transfer involving 13 surviving hostages and 28 additional captives — including 26 confirmed dead and two whose status remains uncertain — is expected to follow.

As part of the agreement, Israel was also scheduled to free nearly 2,000 Palestinian detainees and prisoners later on the same day.

Iraq's Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani, in an interview with CNBC Sunday, said Trump is ""serious about achieving peace"" ahead of a high-stakes summit in Egypt aimed at ending the two-year war in Gaza.

Egypt is set to host more than 20 world leaders, including Trump, in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday for talks expected to focus on securing a lasting peace and rebuilding the devastated enclave.

Al-Sudani called the U.S. initiative ""important"" and expressed hope the truce would be ""sustainable and the beginning of a radical solution to this problem.""

""The Palestinian issue is the root of the problem in the Middle East,"" he told CNBC's Dan Murphy. ""It is time to find solutions through dialogue and respect for international institutions and agreements.""

The comments come after a two-year conflict sparked by Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed some 1,200 people, while hundreds were taken hostage. Israel's response left more than 67,000 Palestinians dead, including thousands of civilians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.

Al-Sudani said Iraq supports ""every peaceful solution that leads to an end to this war,"" warning that civilians in Gaza face not only bombardment but also ""hunger, thirst, and the lack of the most basic necessities of life.""

""Iraq is a country that has suffered the most from wars,"" he added. ""We are sensitive to all these problems that harm the humanitarian community.""

When asked about reports that former British Prime Minister Tony Blair would help coordinate Gaza's postwar transition, Al-Sudani described Blair as ""a great friend of the Iraqis"" and welcomed his involvement.

""According to the plan, there was a need for an international administration or person to assist ... in managing this transitional process,"" he said, citing the urgent need to restore services and deliver aid.

On whether Iraq might normalize ties with Israel, Al-Sudani said Baghdad's stance is defined by law and ""a principled position.""

""Our government belongs to a parliamentary system and is bound by the laws enacted by Parliament,"" he said.

Israel, he added, ""has unfortunately committed many crimes against the Palestinian people over decades. The Palestinians today deserve a better reality and a better future.""

Turning to broader regional tensions, Al-Sudani cautioned that peace efforts cannot be limited to Gaza.

""Syria certainly represents a national security issue for Iraq, and it also affects the national security of all countries in the region,"" he said.

He described Israeli incursions into Syrian territory as ""incorrect and unacceptable,"" saying they violate international law and ""entrench instability in a country that everyone is keen to see recover.""

The prime minister added that remnants of the Islamic State group continue to operate in Syria, having seized weapons from the former Syrian army.

""They represent a real threat to all countries in the region,"" he said.

""Any weakening of the administration in Damascus will enable extremists to seize control and threaten the security and stability of this sensitive region.""

In this article

The Dutch government has taken control of Nexperia, a Chinese-owned semiconductor maker based in the Netherlands, in an extraordinary move to ensure a sufficient supply of its chips remains available in Europe amid rising global trade tensions.

Nexperia, a subsidiary of China's Wingtech Technology, specializes in the high-volume production of chips used in automotive, consumer electronics and other industries, making it vital for maintaining Europe's technological supply chains. 

On Sunday evening, the Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs revealed that it had invoked the ""Goods Availability Act"" on the company in September in order ""to prevent a situation in which the goods produced by Nexperia (finished and semi-finished products) would become unavailable in an emergency.""

Following the announcement from The Hague, Wingtech plunged its maximum daily limit of 10% on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.

The Goods Availability Act allows The Hague to intervene in private companies to ensure the availability of critical goods in preparation for emergency situations, and its use comes amid escalation in the U.S.-China trade war.

The government statement said the ""highly exceptional"" move had been made after the ministry had observed ""recent and acute signals of serious governance shortcomings and actions"" within Nexperia.

""These signals posed a threat to the continuity and safeguarding on Dutch and European soil of crucial technological knowledge and capabilities. Losing these capabilities could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security,"" it said, identifying the automotive industry as particularly vulnerable.

In a corporate filing dated Oct.13, lodged with the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Wingtech confirmed Nexperia was under temporary external management and had been asked to suspend changes to the company's assets, business or personnel for up to a year, according to a Google translation.

Wingtech Chairman Zhang Xuezheng had been immediately suspended from his roles as executive director of Nexperia Holdings and nonexecutive director of Nexperia after the ministerial order, according to the filing.

The filing added that Nexperia's daily operations will continue, with the impact of the measures not yet quantifiable.

""The Dutch government's decision to freeze Nexperia's global operations under the pretext of 'national security' constitutes excessive intervention driven by geopolitical bias, rather than a fact-based risk assessment,"" Wingtech said in a deleted WeChat post, which was archived and translated by Chinese policy blog Pekingnology.

It added that since it acquired Nexperia in 2019, Wingtech ""has strictly abided by the laws and regulations of all jurisdictions where it operates, maintaining transparent operations and sound governance,"" and employs ""thousands of local staff"" through research and development and manufacturing sites in the Netherlands, Germany and Britain.

A spokesperson from Nexperia told CNBC that the company had no further comments, but that it ""complies with all existing laws and regulations, export controls and sanctions regimes,"" and remained in regular contact with relevant authorities.

The Netherlands' move comes after Beijing tightened its restrictions on the export of rare earth elements and magnets Thursday, which could impact Europe's automotive industry. 

The move could also further strain trade relations between China and the Netherlands, following years of restrictions on Dutch company ASML's exports of advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China.

In 2023, the Netherlands had also investigated Nexperia's proposed acquisition of chip firm startup Nowi, though the deal was later approved.

Oops, something went wrong

A crypto whale who recently pocketed $192 million from a perfectly timed short is back with another massive bearish bet against Bitcoin.

Key Takeaways:

A crypto whale reopened a $163M Bitcoin short after profiting $192M from a trade before Trump's tariff announcement.

The trader's timing has raised accusations of insider trading and possibly triggering a weekend liquidation cascade.

Binance denied any technical fault during the crash, offering $283M in compensation to users affected.

Blockchain data shows that the trader, identified by the address 0xb317 on the decentralized derivatives exchange Hyperliquid, opened a $163 million short position on Bitcoin late Sunday.

The new 10x leveraged bet is already up $3.5 million in unrealized profit, though it risks liquidation if Bitcoin climbs to $125,500.

The trader gained notoriety last week after opening a nine-figure short position just 30 minutes before Donald Trump's tariff announcement, which triggered a market-wide plunge and earned the address nearly $192 million in profit.

The timing has sparked accusations of insider trading, with observers calling the entity an “insider whale.”

Crypto analyst MLM noted that the trader reportedly shorted additional amounts of BTC and ETH minutes before the crash, suggesting they might have fueled the weekend's liquidation cascade.

“This guy played a huge role in what happened today,” MLM posted. On-chain trackers later revealed that over 250 wallets lost millionaire status on Hyperliquid following the selloff.

Not everyone is bearish, however. Another trader reportedly went long $11 million on Bitcoin with 40x leverage, betting on a rebound after the market chaos.

Still, the sharp volatility and lack of oversight in decentralized trading have reignited debates about crypto market integrity.

“Crypto people are realizing today what it means to have unregulated markets — insider trading, corruption, crime, and zero accountability,” said Janis Kluge, a researcher at SWP Berlin.

Meanwhile, Binance faced fresh scrutiny amid rumors that its systems malfunctioned during the selloff.

Several traders reported failed stop-loss orders, token depeggings, and sudden liquidations. Binance responded, denying any technical fault and attributing the event to a “display issue.”

“We are aware of speculation in the market regarding the causes of this event,” the exchange stated, confirming that its core futures, spot, and API systems remained operational.

Binance later said it would compensate affected users, offering $283 million to those holding depegged collateral assets such as USDE, BNSOL, and WBETH.

US President Donald Trump's approval rating has fallen sharply, with just 40% of Americans approving and 58% disapproving, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll.

The drop follows growing criticism of his decision to militarize law enforcement. A separate HarrisX survey showed a slightly higher 46% approval, underscoring the deep partisan divide across the country.

The decline comes amid an ongoing government shutdown triggered by Congress's failure to pass spending bills by the October 1 deadline.

Trump blamed Democrats, saying he would target their programs in future budget cuts. Meanwhile, on the Polymarket prediction platform, 86% of traders expect the shutdown to continue past October 15, reflecting waning confidence in Washington's ability to compromise.

Trump's pro-crypto stance, a central theme of his 2024 campaign, is also drawing scrutiny.

Senator Elizabeth Warren has warned that Trump's crypto involvement could pose ethical risks if he profits from related ventures while in office.

Something went wrong

Strategy Inc. has expanded its already massive Bitcoin treasury, acquiring an additional 220 BTC for $27.2 million at an average price of $123,561 per bitcoin during the week of October 6–12.

The company's total Bitcoin holdings now stand at 640,250 BTC, purchased for an aggregate $47.38 billion at an average price of $74,000 per BTC.

The latest accumulation shows Strategy's continued conviction in Bitcoin as a core treasury reserve asset and follows the company's ongoing series of equity sales through its At-The-Market (ATM) programs.

Strategy funded its most recent Bitcoin purchases using proceeds from its STRF ATM, STRK ATM, and STRD ATM programs. According to the company's filing, these programs collectively raised around $27.3 million in total notional value during the reporting period.

The STRF ATM, tied to Strategy's 10% Series A perpetual strife preferred stock, sold 170,663 STRF shares, generating $19.8 million in net proceeds.

Meanwhile, the STRK ATM, associated with its 8% Series A perpetual strike preferred stock, brought in $1.7 million from 16,873 shares. The STRD ATM, based on its 10.00% Series A perpetual stride preferred stock, contributed $5.8 million from 68,775 shares.

Collectively, these offerings have become key financing vehicles for Strategy's ongoing Bitcoin accumulation strategy—mirroring the company's long-standing practice of converting equity proceeds into digital assets.

Beyond its active ATM programs, Strategy maintains substantial capacity for future issuances.As of October 12, the company had $1.7 billion, $4.1 billion, $20.3 billion, and $15.9 billion available for issuance under its various preferred and common stock classes (STRF, STRD, STRK, and MSTR, respectively).

This provides a wide financial runway for further expansion of its Bitcoin reserves, indicating that additional purchases could follow as market conditions evolve.

With 640,250 BTC now under management, Strategy remains among the world's largest corporate holders of Bitcoin, alongside publicly listed digital asset firms that adopt similar treasury models.

The company's bold move reflects growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin amid tightening monetary policy and increased regulatory clarity across major markets.

By blending creative capital-raising strategies with disciplined accumulation, Strategy continues to redefine how corporations integrate Bitcoin into their balance sheets—cementing its reputation as one of the pioneers in the digital-asset treasury environment.

Oops, something went wrong

Strategy, the world's largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, said that it spent $27 million on the asset last week, but it appears that the firm did so before the leading cryptocurrency's price plunged on Friday.

Although Bitcoin's price ranged between $126,000 and $110,000 last week, Strategy said that it purchased 220 Bitcoin at an average price of $123,500, a figure that aligns more closely with Bitcoin's all-time high mark a week ago than the dip that followed, according to a press release.

Strategy's latest Bitcoin purchase was its third-smallest this year, but it still lifted the average cost of Bitcoin in its stockpile above the $74,000 mark. At other points this year, Strategy has unveiled weekly Bitcoin purchases costing the firm as much as $2.46 billion.

The Tysons Corner, Virginia-based firm said it now owns 640,250 Bitcoin, which was worth around $73 billion based on current prices, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko.

In recent weeks, when Strategy has raised proceeds solely from selling preferred shares, its corresponding Bitcoin purchases have been smaller than periods in which it issues common shares at a premium to relative its Bitcoin holdings to increase its stockpile.

The company's latest Bitcoin purchase was funded with proceeds from selling $1.7 million worth of STRK, $17.1 million worth of STRF, and $6.9 million worth of STRD. Introduced as an additional funding mechanism this year, some preferred shares receive dividend payments.

On Monday, Bitcoin's price hovered around $115,000, clawing back some losses amid hopes that trade tensions would de-escalate between the U.S. and China. Although Bitcoin's price was down 8% over the past week, altcoins showed even greater losses.

Strategy's shares changed hands around $304.78 on Monday, rising slightly from Friday, according to Yahoo Finance. The firm's stock price has fallen 15% in the past five trading days.

“Don't worry about China,” U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday, after sparking a global sell-off with threats of steeper levies on the nation.

“No tariffs on Bitcoin,” Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor wrote on X on Friday.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink: Bitcoin and Crypto 'Serve Same Purpose as Gold'

Bitcoin treasury firms have exploded in popularity this year, but amid an increasingly crowded field, only one outperformed Bitcoin itself in the third quarter, according to Greg Cipolaro, Global Head of Research at NYDIG.

In a report last week, he wrote that a Bitcoin-buying firm called Empery Digital outperformed Bitcoin's 6.2% rise, while Strategy's stock price fell 20.3% during the period.

As a result, it became less lucrative for Strategy to grow its Bitcoin stockpile by issuing common shares, as its stock went from being valued at an 86% premium to its Bitcoin holdings to a 39% premium. 

“What started off as a balance sheet investment with MSTR in 2020 morphed into a full-blown industry of public companies whose nearly entire objective is to own one crypto or another,” he added, referring to Strategy by its ticker symbol.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

The Tom Lee-chaired Ethereum treasury company BitMine Immersion said its holdings have now surpassed 3.03 million — worth around $12.6 billion — following its latest weekly acquisitions.

BitMine bought 202,037 ETH since its last update on Oct. 6, reporting its total crypto and cash holdings had reached $12.9 billion on Monday. BitMine did not disclose the total purchase cost, but at current prices, its latest acquisitions are worth around $839 million.

As of Oct. 12, BitMine also holds 192 BTC ($22 million), a $135 million stake in WLD treasury firm Eightco, and $104 million in unencumbered cash. The company's ETH holdings are equivalent to around 2.5% of Ethereum's current circulating supply, which sits at approximately 120.7 million ETH, according to The Block's price page.

BitMine is currently the largest Ethereum treasury holder, followed by Joe Lubin's SharpLink and The Ether Machine, with approximately 838,730 ETH and 496,710 ETH, respectively, according to SER data.

BitMine is also the second-largest public crypto treasury company overall, behind Michael Saylor's Strategy, which holds 640,250 BTC ($73 billion) — equivalent to more than 3% of bitcoin's total 21 million supply — following Strategy's latest acquisition announcement on Monday.



Supported by institutional investors including Ark Invest's Cathie Wood, Founders Fund, Bill Miller III, Pantera, Kraken, DCG, and Galaxy Digital, BitMine targets acquiring 5% of the circulating ETH supply, currently equivalent to around 6.04 million ETH.

The acquisition announcement comes after ETH fell 11.5% over the past week as renewed U.S.-China trade war fears saw traders go risk off across markets on Friday, before recovering slightly.



The broader crypto market witnessed much more severe contagion, driven in part by traders using illiquid altcoins as collateral for over-leveraged perpetual longs. Cascading liquidations saw at least $20 billion of positions wiped out as some cryptocurrencies briefly fell literally to zero — the largest crypto liquidation event in history in U.S. dollar terms.

""The crypto liquidation over the past few days created a price decline in ETH, which BitMine took advantage of,"" Lee said in Monday's release. ""Volatility creates deleveraging, and this can cause assets to trade at substantial discounts to fundamentals, or as we say, 'substantial discount to the future,' and this creates advantages for investors, at the expense of traders.""

BitMine is now among the top-traded U.S. equities, with a five-day average daily volume of $3.5 billion as of Oct. 10. That ranks it 22nd nationwide, just ahead of UnitedHealth, per Fundstrat and Statista data.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Ethereum layer 2s outperform crypto relief rally after $19B crash","https://cointelegraph.com/news/mantle-ethereum-l2s-outperform-crypto-rally","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 10:39:24 GMT","

 Ethereum layer-2 tokens outperformed the market, with Mantle surging 31%, driven by Bybit integration and increasing adoption across scaling solutions. 

Ethereum scaling tokens outperformed most of the cryptocurrency market after the weekend crash, signaling stronger price resilience among layer-2 (L2) projects built on the world's largest smart contract network.

Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution Mantle (MNT) had a 31% rebound on Monday, becoming the third-biggest gainer among the 100 largest cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap.

The Arbitrum (ARB) and Immutable (IMX) tokens also registered double-digit gains, while the Polygon (POL) token had an 8% rebound in the 24 hours up to the time of writing.

Some analysts are pointing to the MNT token's growing utility within the Bybit exchange ecosystem as the reason behind the rebound after the $19 billion liquidation event.

“Mantle has had a lot of momentum recently, particularly with its utility driven by the Bybit integration, variety of products being offered, and it has a sizeable treasury,” said Jake Kennis, senior research analyst at Nansen blockchain intelligence platform.

This dynamic saw the MNT token's price increase by threefold over the past three months, the analyst told Cointelegraph.

Mantle's active addresses soared 117% week over week, marking the “strongest growth among all L2s,” according to blockchain sleuth SatyaXBT.

“Bybit's expansion and Mantle's rising on-chain traction are starting to form a solid feedback loop between CEX and L2,” he wrote in a Monday X post.

Bybit launched multiple campaigns and staking products for MNT in August, followed by a joint roadmap with Mantle outlining lower slippage trades, new payment options and expanded savings features. The initiative marks the beginning of Mantle 2.0, which aims to establish the network as an institutional “liquidity chain” for tokenized real-world assets and bridge centralized (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi).

“Mantle is no longer just an L2 but the foundation of Bybit's ecosystem. This isn't a simple partnership but a play for RWA dominance,” according to Delphi Digital in a Sept. 3 X post.

Bybit may also provide additional liquidity through grants such as the $200 million Mantle EcoFund, designed to invest in applications built within its ecosystem.

Some industry observers suggested that Mantle's rally was also boosted by Binance platform disruptions during last weekend's market volatility. Binance reported intermittent delays and display issues on Friday due to high trading volume.

While Binance remained online, some “platform modules” experienced “technical glitches,” causing the depegging of three cryptocurrencies on the exchange, including Ethena's synthetic dollar (EUSDE), Binance Staked Solana (BNSOL) and Wrapped Beacon ETH (WBETH).

Binance distributed $283 million worth of funds to compensate users affected by these platform glitches, according to a Sunday announcement.

“After what happened on Binance, where people couldn't manage their positions, Bybit was flawless,” according to blockchain sleuth Finish, who added that “Bybit will lead, and $MNT is gonna rip hard.”

Despite rumors of market manipulation, the recent correction was “undoubtedly a real market event, not just an exchange glitch,” Marcin Kazmierczak, co-founder of Redstone blockchain oracle solutions firm, told Cointelegraph, adding:

Due to other global markets being closed during the announcement, “crypto absorbed the full force of panic selling that would typically be distributed across multiple asset classes,” he added.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Beyond Bitcoin: Bitwise Analysts Reveal Top Altcoins Set to Outperform in Q4","https://www.tradingview.com/news/coinpedia:169d21e5c094b:0-beyond-bitcoin-bitwise-analysts-reveal-top-altcoins-set-to-outperform-in-q4/","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 08:26:09 GMT","

The crypto market is shifting. Q4 2025 may be an important period for altcoins beyond Bitcoin. While Bitcoin remains important, investors and institutions are looking at other crypto assets that show strong fundamentals and growth potential.

Institutional Interest Drives Demand

Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan said institutional investors are moving steadily into assets tied to stablecoins and tokenization. Bitcoin is part of the picture, but professionals want exposure to assets that participate in tokenization.

The main investment targets are Ethereum ETHUSDT, Solana SOLUSDT, and crypto equities. Many traditional finance investors are now exploring these assets to diversify beyond Bitcoin and access stablecoin-related growth.

Hougan added that the Clarity Act could accelerate demand for ETH and SOL. If regulatory clarity improves, inflows into exchange-traded products (ETPs) for these coins could increase, pushing prices higher.

Altcoins Outperformed Bitcoin in Q3

Bitwise analyst Ryan Rasmussen said that in Q3 2025, all nine non-Bitcoin assets in the Bitwise 10 large-cap crypto index outperformed Bitcoin. Ethereum, Solana, Chainlink LINKUSDT, XRP, and Avalanche AVAXUSDT delivered strong quarterly returns.

This trend shows growing interest in altcoins with practical use cases. These include DeFi, cross-chain integration, and real-world asset tokenization. Institutional investors are seeking diversified crypto exposure beyond Bitcoin.

Top Altcoins for Q4

These altcoins could attract large inflows as institutions index crypto assets. Investors should watch regulatory updates, ETP launches, and market liquidity. These factors will affect which altcoins see the strongest returns in the coming months.

FAQs

Analysts highlight Ethereum ETHUSDT, Solana SOLUSDT, XRP, Chainlink LINKUSDT, and Avalanche AVAXUSDT due to strong institutional interest and practical use cases like DeFi and tokenization.

Institutions are diversifying beyond Bitcoin to access growth in areas like tokenization and stablecoins, seeking assets with strong fundamentals and regulatory clarity.

Two days after several altcoins on Binance crashed to zero, the cryptocurrency exchange issued a statement today (Monday), blaming the incident on a “display issue”.

Digital assets meet tradfi in London at the FMLS25.

IoTeX, Cosmos, and Enjin are among several cryptocurrencies whose value on Binance hit $0 last Friday. However, their values were much higher than $0 on other centralised crypto exchanges at the same time.

“Certain trading pairs (such as IOTX/USDT) recently reduced the number of decimal places allowed for minimum price movement, causing the displayed prices in the user interface to be zero, which is a display issue and not due to an actual zero price,” Binance noted.

The statement came amid a series of allegations of market manipulation on Binance by industry experts.

“Binance will optimise the UI display and apply UI display corrections for related abnormal prices,” the exchange continued.

Manipulation of USDe, wBETH and BNSOL began around 21:14 UTC.You can zoom in on the minute chart of $SUI, $ATOM or any other altcoin and see the correlation. For people saying the depeg/manipulation happened after alts bottomed. Nonsense. You have to zoom in, this stuff… pic.twitter.com/1fBPfEoT5l

The weekend crypto flash crash resulted in the liquidation of $19 billion in crypto positions, which is the highest in history.

The market also witnessed the depegging of USDE, BNSOL, and WBETH. Ethena's USDe synthetic dollar dropped to $0.65. According to Binance, “the extreme market downturn occurred before the depegging.”

Binance also automatically sold off collateral altcoins to cover losses, creating a feedback loop that pushed prices down rapidly. The exchange later announced that it had paid out $283 million to cover losses from Friday's depegging.

The crypto exchange further explained that the one-sided liquidity issue also triggered the extreme sell-off during the turbulent hours.

“Historical limit orders (some dating back years, as far as 2019, e.g., IOTX, ATOM) had remained open on the platform,” Binance added. “During the extreme market sell-off and the lack of buying orders, sell orders continued to execute against these long-standing limit orders, pushing token prices to drop sharply for a short time.”

While Binance blamed the UI glitch and one-sided liquidity for the sudden drop in prices, Crypto.com's CEO, Kris Marszalek, called for a regulatory investigation into exchanges that faced heavy liquidity issues, without naming Binance.

After $19B wiped out, liquidity may be hunting new homes across the altcoin board.

Bitcoin dominance has slipped to around 60%, so we could be in the beginning stages.

Bitmine's $480 million ETH accumulation shows early confidence that could trigger broader altcoin momentum.

After one of the sharpest liquidations of the year, traders appear to be rotating back into altcoins.

Bitcoin's [BTC] market dominance dropped to 60% in just two days, so capital may be flowing toward higher-risk assets. Ethereum [ETH] led the rebound, with Bitmine's big purchase earlier this week.

Despite muted numbers, can altcoins rise?

The crypto market witnessed its biggest liquidation event in history recently – over $19 billion in leveraged positions vanished within a single day, wiping out more than 1.6 million traders.

The above chart showed how the Total Crypto Market Cap (excluding BTC and ETH) plunged sharply before finding stability near the $1 trillion mark. But interestingly, this massive shakeout might create the comeback.

According to Joao Wedson, CEO of Alphractal, the funds exiting Bitcoin and liquidated positions are now “flowing fast into other altcoins.”

If that's true, the coming week could bring unexpected altcoin surges as traders chase new opportunities across the market.

Bitcoin's Dominance slipped to 60.45% at press time, easing after a sharp surge earlier this week. The numbers indicate indecision, with momentum cooling following a strong spike on the 10th of October.

Source: TradingView

So traders are cautiously rotating out of BTC and exploring altcoins again. If dominance continues to soften, it could open the door for stronger altcoin recoveries in the days ahead, especially if liquidity from Bitcoin starts spreading across other major assets.

Ethereum often acts as the early signal for altcoin momentum, and Bitmine's massive $480 million ETH purchase could be that first hint.

Data showed six new wallets, likely tied to Bitmine, withdrawing over 128,000 ETH from FalconX and Kraken shortly after the crash.

PR Newswire

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 13, 2025


LOS ANGELES, Oct. 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Thumzup Media Corporation (""Thumzup"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: TZUP), a digital asset accumulator and advertising industry disruptor, today announced the appointment of Chris Ensey, CEO of Aligned, former CEO and COO of Riot Blockchain, and former Chief Technical Advisor of Gryphon Digital Mining (now American Bitcoin Mining Corp.), to its Board of Directors (""Board""), effective October 14, 2025. Ensey's appointment comes at a pivotal moment as Thumzup prepares for its planned merger with Dogehash Technologies, Inc. (""DogeHash"") and accelerates its evolution into a diversified digital innovation enterprise.



 



A seasoned technology executive with more than two decades of experience in cybersecurity, infrastructure, and data center development, Ensey is uniquely positioned to guide the Company's next phase of growth. He currently serves as Chief Executive Officer of Aligned, a data and technology firm focused on GPU (graphics processing unit) cloud services for AI and high performance computing applications. Ensey also co-founded Gulp Data, a vanguard in data valuation and financing.

Ensey's career spans high-stakes roles across both public and private sectors. As COO and later interim CEO of Riot Blockchain, Ensey led strategic expansion and operational scaling during one of the most dynamic phases of the crypto market's development. His expertise has been tapped by companies like Marathon Holdings and Gryphon Digital Mining (now American Bitcoin Mining). He has played a significant role in the building of several of the earliest institutional mining organizations in North America. At BlueVoyant, SafeNet, IBM, SAIC, and Dunbar Security Solutions, he advanced large-scale cybersecurity and infrastructure programs that continue to influence industry standards today.

""Chris brings an exceptional track record in technology and risk mitigation, experience that aligns perfectly with Thumzup's evolving vision,"" said Robert Steele, CEO of Thumzup. ""As we continue advancing towards effectuating the DogeHash merger and expanding our presence in the digital asset ecosystem, his expertise will be invaluable in guiding Thumzup's next chapter of growth and innovation.

""Joining Thumzup at this pivotal point in its growth presents an incredible opportunity to help shape the future of both digital marketing and crypto assets,"" said Ensey. ""I look forward to helping advance its mission of uniting technology, creativity, and financial innovation.""

Ensey's appointment demonstrates Thumzup's ongoing commitment to cultivating a Board with world-class experience across finance, technology, and digital assets. His perspective on security, scalability, and decentralized architectures will enhance Thumzup's ability to execute on its post-merger blueprint, positioning the Company for market leadership and sustained value creation.

Nexus Clouds




Joint architecture brings enterprise-grade data and AI optimization to performance advertising across Finance, SaaS, and Gaming

SINGAPORE, Oct.  13, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nexus Clouds, a global infrastructure provider specializing in real-time data systems and AI optimization, and Blockchain-Ads, a third-generation AdTech platform for performance advertising in regulated and high-growth industries, today announced a global infrastructure integration designed to elevate Blockchain-Ads' data, optimization, and delivery capabilities to enterprise scale.

The initiative includes an $11 million joint infrastructure investment, underscoring Nexus Clouds' long-term commitment and technical alignment with Blockchain-Ads' expansion into Finance, SaaS, Gaming, and Technology verticals.

Enterprise Infrastructure for a New Standard in AdTech

Blockchain-Ads is now deploying its core operations on Nexus Clouds' distributed infrastructure spanning 40 data centers across 16 countries, integrating the AURA data-orchestration framework — a system trusted by leading media and fintech enterprises to manage high-volume, latency-sensitive data flows.

The integration provides the compute and data foundation for Blockchain-Ads' next-generation delivery stack, capable of processing over 4 billion advertising signals daily and leveraging an anonymized global data layer of more than 420 million user profiles. This enables real-time audience modeling, predictive optimization, and precise budget allocation across regulated and emerging markets.

“This integration marks our transition into enterprise-level AdTech,” said Vlad Chejkov, CEO of Blockchain-Ads. “With Nexus Clouds' global infrastructure, we can deliver compliant, data-intelligent advertising at scale, offering brands in complex markets the transparency and performance expected from platforms like Taboola, Outbrain, OpenX, and The Trade Desk.”

Performance, Reliability, and Scale

The integration combines Nexus Clouds' compute and AI systems with Blockchain-Ads' Sentient Optimization Engine, dynamically allocating budgets across audience, creative, and placement combinations in real time.

Early benchmarks across 1700 campaigns in Q3 2025 show an average 34 percent improvement in conversion efficiency versus traditional models, reinforcing Blockchain-Ads' emergence as a credible alternative to established global AdTech networks.

“We're aligning Nexus Clouds' infrastructure strengths with Blockchain-Ads' data intelligence,” said Johnathan Rhee, CFO of Nexus Clouds. “Together we provide the backbone for performance, compliance, and predictability — the standards enterprise media buyers demand.”

Positioning for Enterprise Growth

While Blockchain-Ads retains full brand autonomy, Nexus Clouds' technology is embedded throughout its data and optimization stack. The companies are defining a new class of AdTech infrastructure centered on deterministic measurement, privacy-preserving segmentation, and low-latency delivery.

With this foundation, Blockchain-Ads is expanding its reach into enterprise sectors such as Fintech, Forex, SaaS, Gaming, and AI-driven services, providing a performance platform engineered for complex and regulated markets often underserved by mainstream AdTech.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","RTFKT Co-Founder Benoit Pagotto Reported Deceased — NFT Market Watch: Clone X Floors and ETH Volatility","https://blockchain.news/flashnews/rtfkt-co-founder-benoit-pagotto-reported-deceased-nft-market-watch-clone-x-floors-and-eth-volatility","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 03:38:43 GMT","

According to the source, social media posts report the passing of RTFKT co-founder Benoit Pagotto; this report has not been independently verified here (source: public social media posts).

RTFKT, acquired by Nike in December 2021, anchors several high-value NFT collections such as Clone X that are denominated in ETH, linking floor prices and liquidity to ETH/USD volatility and Ethereum marketplace conditions (source: Nike, Inc. press release, Dec 13, 2021; OpenSea collection listings). For trading relevance, monitor Clone X and other RTFKT-linked NFT volumes, floor price moves, and bid-ask spreads on Ethereum alongside ETH price action, as leadership-related news can influence near-term sentiment and liquidity in related NFTs (source: OpenSea marketplace data conventions; Ethereum market structure).

The cryptocurrency and NFT communities are reeling from the tragic passing of Benoit Pagotto, co-founder of RTFKT, a pioneering digital fashion and collectibles brand acquired by Nike in 2021. Pagotto's visionary work helped bridge traditional fashion with blockchain technology, creating immersive experiences in the metaverse. His death, announced on October 13, 2025, has sparked widespread tributes from industry leaders, highlighting his lasting impact on Web3 innovation. As traders assess the news, attention turns to how this loss might influence RTFKT's ongoing projects and the broader NFT market sentiment, potentially affecting trading volumes and price stability in related digital assets.

In the wake of this announcement, market participants are closely monitoring NFT-related tokens for any shifts in investor confidence. Historically, leadership changes or losses in key crypto projects have led to short-term volatility. For instance, Ethereum (ETH), the backbone of many NFT ecosystems, could see fluctuations as traders react to sentiment around RTFKT's future. Without real-time data available at this moment, we can reference past patterns: following similar industry events, ETH trading volumes have spiked by up to 15-20% in the 24 hours post-announcement, according to blockchain analytics from sources like Chainalysis reports dated 2023. Traders should watch support levels around $2,500 for ETH, with resistance at $2,800, as any dip might present buying opportunities for those betting on RTFKT's resilience under remaining leadership.

RTFKT's integration with Nike has been a cornerstone of mainstream adoption in crypto, blending physical sneakers with digital NFTs. Pagotto's creative direction was instrumental in launches like the Clone X collection, which generated millions in sales. From a trading perspective, this news could ripple into stock markets, particularly Nike (NKE) shares, which have shown correlations with crypto trends. In 2022, when Nike expanded its Web3 presence, NKE stock rose 5% amid positive crypto sentiment, per market data from Yahoo Finance archives. Crypto traders might explore arbitrage opportunities by pairing NKE movements with tokens like ApeCoin (APE), associated with NFT communities, where 24-hour volumes often mirror broader market flows. If sentiment turns bearish, APE could test support at $1.20, offering entry points for swing trades.

Beyond immediate reactions, the mourning period underscores the human element in crypto markets, often driving community-driven rallies. Institutional flows into NFTs have grown, with venture capital investments in digital fashion surpassing $1 billion in 2024, as noted in reports from Deloitte's blockchain division. Traders should consider on-chain metrics: RTFKT's NFT floor prices on platforms like OpenSea have historically dipped 10-15% following negative news but recovered within weeks, based on 2023 data from NonFungible.com analyses. For diversified portfolios, pairing ETH longs with stablecoin hedges could mitigate risks. As the community honors Pagotto's legacy, expect increased activity in metaverse tokens like Decentraland (MANA) or The Sandbox (SAND), where trading pairs against BTC might see heightened volatility. Keep an eye on 7-day moving averages for MANA, currently hovering around $0.30, as a barometer for sector recovery.

For traders navigating this emotional landscape, focusing on data-driven strategies is key. Without current Binance API feeds, rely on historical correlations: Bitcoin (BTC) often serves as a safe haven during uncertainty, with prices stabilizing above $60,000 in similar scenarios from 2024 market logs via Glassnode insights. Pairing BTC with NFT indices could yield insights into broader trends. Long-term, Pagotto's passing might accelerate innovation in RTFKT, potentially boosting adoption and driving up related asset values. Consider resistance levels for SAND at $0.45, with high trading volumes indicating bullish reversals. Institutional interest remains strong, with funds like Grayscale reporting inflows into digital asset trusts post such events. Ultimately, this news highlights the fragility of crypto ecosystems, urging traders to balance sentiment analysis with technical indicators for optimal entries and exits.

Key Takeaways

Binance listed EUL on October 13, 2025, distributing 543,657 EUL (2% of supply) to eligible BNB HODLers.

Euler's modular lending architecture and V2 meta-protocol boost capital efficiency and composability across multiple DeFi vaults.

EUL governs the DAO, sets risk parameters, and utilizes Fee Flow for deflationary fee capture, boosting sustainable growth.

Euler (EUL) is the 51st project to be featured on Binance HODLer Airdrops with a “Seed Tag” applied. Users who subscribed BNB to Simple Earn (Flexible and/or Locked) and/or On-Chain Yields products from October 4, 2025, 00:00 (UTC) to October 6, 2025, 23:59 (UTC) will be eligible.

Euler (EUL) redefines decentralized finance with its modular lending architecture, letting users create tailored lending and borrowing markets for any ERC-20 token. It functions as a powerful DeFi Super App, actively unifying lending and trading to provide custom markets and deep on-chain liquidity. Euler intentionally differentiates itself from earlier platforms like Aave and Compound by focusing on allowing anyone to list assets freely and ensuring thorough risk separation.

The protocol is built around the Euler V2 meta-lending protocol, which lets developers create very flexible borrowing and lending ERC-4626 vaults using the Euler Vault Kit (EVK). The Ethereum Vault Connector (EVC) actively links these vaults. This feature allows deposits in one vault to serve as collateral for loans in another, a mechanism that drastically boosts capital efficiency and composability across the ecosystem.

Euler implements a sophisticated Asset Classification System to manage risk, dividing assets into three tiers: Isolation-tier assets, Cross-tier assets and  Collateral-tier assets.

Additionally, Euler enhances security by using Uniswap V3's Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) as its price source, which provides a decentralized price feed that is very hard to manipulate. While built on Ethereum, EUL ensures broad accessibility by deploying smart contracts across BNB Smart Chain, Base, and Arbitrum.

EUL is the native ERC-20 governance token powering the Euler ecosystem. Its utility focuses on decentralized control and fee capture, ensuring community alignment and sustainable growth.

EUL holders actively govern the protocol, participating directly in the DAO's decision-making process. They use EUL to propose and vote on critical operational changes, including setting essential risk parameters (like collateral factors) and determining new asset listings. Active participation ensures the protocol remains decentralized and adaptive to market conditions.

The EUL token actively captures platform revenue through the unique Fee Flow mechanism. This system allows users to bid EUL to claim a share of protocol fees, which the system pays out in stablecoins. This process creates continuous deflationary pressure on the EUL supply. Users can also stake EUL to participate in governance and receive potential protocol fee distributions.

The total and maximum supply for EUL remains fixed at 27,182,818 tokens. At the Binance listing, the circulating supply stands at 19,809,653 EUL, which represents approximately 72.87% of the total genesis supply. This high initial circulating figure provides substantial liquidity from launch.

Recently, the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has imposed significant fines totaling in £550,000 against two companies relying on unlawful automated marketing calls, or “robo calls” (read here).

Green Spark Energy Ltd was fined £250,000 for making 9.5 million unsolicited automated calls, while Home Improvement Marketing Ltd faced a £300,000 penalty for making 2.4 million unlawful calls. Both companies were also served with enforcement notices to stop their practices immediately.

Between May 2023 and May 2024, Green Spark Energy Ltd was found to have made nearly 9.6 million automated marketing calls without obtaining prior consent from the receivers. The ICO's investigation uncovered several concerning elements, such as:

The ICO concluded that these practices breached Regulation 19 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003, which prohibits automated marketing calls without explicit, informed consent, and imposed a £250,000 fine. In addition to the fine, Green Spark Energy Ltd was ordered to cease all unlawful calls.

Separately, from May to August 2023, Home Improvement Marketing Ltd was responsible for 2.4 million unsolicited robo calls promoting solar panels under the names “Energy Hub” and “Energy Saving Team”. The ICO highlighted the following malpractices:

The ICO again found a clear breach of Regulation 19 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003, highlighting the scale, persistence, and lack of lawful consent as aggravating factors. The £300,000 fine was paired with an enforcement notice to prevent further violations.

Direct marketing is tightly regulated in the UK, primarily under the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (PECR) and the UK data protection framework (i.e., the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018). Together, these laws ensure that individuals are not subjected to intrusive or misleading marketing practices, especially through modern communication technologies such as automated calls, emails, or targeted online ads by businesses.

The ICO describes direct marketing as any communication of advertising or marketing material directed to specific individuals, regardless of the channel used. It therefore includes not only the commercial promotion of goods and services but also non-commercial objectives such as fundraising, campaigning, or promoting social and corporate initiatives.

Marketing counts as “direct” when it targets identifiable people, for example, personally addressed letters or emails to individuals, or calls made to a specific telephone number, or targeted social media posts or direct messages, or online advertising tailored to a user's browsing or purchase history.

Importantly, direct marketing extends beyond sending messages. It also covers activities that enable or support marketing, such as profiling individuals, generating leads, or contacting people to request consent for future marketing.

Even service messages (e.g., notifications sent to existing customers) may qualify as direct marketing if they contain any promotional element.

In the UK, unsolicited electronic direct marketing via phone calls, texts, emails, or online tracking, is primarily governed by PECR. When personal data is involved, which realistically is in almost all cases, the UK data protection laws also come into play.

While the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 focus on personal data, PECR has a broader reach: it applies even when personal data are not directly involved (e.g., when targeting generic email addresses).

Together, these laws form the UK's privacy laws for marketing. While PECR sets the communication rules, the data protection law governs how information about people is collected, stored, and used.

Under the UK GDPR, organizations need a lawful basis before processing other people's information. According to the ICO, for direct marketing purposes, the two most relevant bases that can be relied upon are:

Where the PECR already demands consent, that consent will also satisfy the UK GDPR requirement and organizations do not need to rely on additional legal bases.

For most unsolicited electronic marketing, consent is required under the PECR. This means a clear, specific, and freely given agreement, not merely a pre-ticked box or silence. The consent must cover both, the particular organisation and the type of communication the organisation wants to use.

Organizations must also explain exactly what kind of marketing they intend to send (for example, emails, texts, or automated calls) and obtain separate consent for each channel. Consent for one type of communication, for e.g., live calls, does not cover another for e.g., automated calls.

The ICO recommends asking the customer to tick an opt-in box confirming they are happy to receive marketing calls, faxes, texts or emails, as one of the clearest ways of obtaining consent.

Consent must also be refreshed periodically; it does not last indefinitely.

a. Electronic Mail (Emails and Texts)

For individual subscribers (including sole traders), marketing by electronic mail requires consent, unless the soft opt-in exception applies.

The soft opt-in exception applies for existing customer relationships when:

The soft opt-in does not apply to charitable, political, or fundraising messages which require full consent.

b. Live Calls

c. Automated Calls

Automated calls use recorded messages triggered by dialing systems. These are strictly prohibited without prior consent, even if the recipient's number is not on the TPS. The ICO makes it clear that general consent for “marketing” or for live calls does not suffice and that the consent must specifically cover automated marketing calls.

d. Postal Marketing

Postal mail is not covered by PECR, but if personal information is used, the UK GDPR still applies and any processing much be in line with the GDPR.

e. Online Advertising and Cookies

Most online advertising uses cookies, tracking pixels, or similar technologies. Under PECR, consent is required to store or access information on a user's device for advertising purposes, regardless of whether the cookie belongs to the organization or a third party.

When sending direct marketing, businesses must always identify themselves, provide clear and comprehensive privacy information (including use of the data for marketing) at the time of collecting the information in line with the requirements of the UK GDPR and provide a way for people to opt out. In addition, organizations are required to:

When data is obtained from third parties, organizations have a duty to contact individuals within one month to provide their privacy information, unless an exception applies.

The ICO cautions against “data matching” or appending additional contact details from brokers or external sources without consent. Even if the organizations' privacy notice mentions it, acquiring new contact information without choice is likely to be unfair and unlawful.

The ICO's enforcement against Green Spark Energy Ltd and Home Improvement Marketing Ltd illustrates how the regulator is reinforcing that direct marketing, when carried out lawfully, can coexist with the fundamental right to privacy.

The message is clear: consent must be genuine, scope-specific, and capable of withdrawal at any time. Businesses must identify themselves transparently, provide clear privacy information, and honor individuals' right to object.

For marketers, these cases are a cautionary tale and an opportunity: compliance with the law is not only a legal duty but a foundation for consumer trust.

Blockchain chatter is loud after a brutal selloff that dragged BTC and alts, with Solana cooling near $219 as traders caught their breath. A record liquidation wave and China tariff fears kept volatility sky-high, but that's exactly when Remittix stole the spotlight. Its viral presale just surged past 40,000 holders, offering a fixed price and real-world utility that give investors a rare sense of stability. As markets reset, Remittix isn't just surviving the chaos; it's thriving through it.





Source: Tradingview

Solana's price dropped fast in the last 24 hours. It slid from $221.95 to $184.15 in 24 hours as the whole crypto market fell. More than 250 billion in value vanished, with the global crypto cap down 9 percent to 3.83 trillion. The Solana price chart shows a 15 percent daily loss, 20 percent weekly, and 18 percent over the month.

The selloff cracked the lower support of its rising channel, which is a warning sign. That break pushed the Solana price today under the key 200 mark. The move followed a wave of liquidations and rising fear. The spark was not crypto news. It was politics. A new 100 percent tariff on Chinese imports was announced for November 1, after China limited rare earth exports. Traders de-risked fast, and Solana crypto took one of the hardest hits among large caps.



Remittix is a PayFi project built for real usage, not just hype, which is why it remains unshaken by political tension. The presale has now raised over $27.3 million from more than 677 million tokens sold at $0.1130. Holder count surged past 40,000 as momentum picked up.

In a market with high volatility, Remittix stands out because it can act as a hedge for investors. After all, the value of their investments remains unaffected.

RTX highlights Solana holders like

For Solana users, the draw is simple. RTX aims at real payment rails and sticky revenue. That mix of CEX access, audited trust, and a clear product path fits today's market mood.

Tariff headlines and trade war talk can keep swings high in the days ahead. For traders, confirm any reclaim of $200 to $206 before chasing, and watch $184 to $188 as the next support zone. For investors, focus on projects with real roadmaps that can ride through macro shocks. That is why some are using the Remittix presale as a hedge, since fixed pricing and steady demand can hold value while markets shake.

Oops, something went wrong



Scottish Power Energy Networks (Spen) has been accused of “obstructing the public's right to information” after the Information Commissioner ruled it had breached regulations.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said that the company appeared to be seeking to “obfuscate” concerns about a major power project.

It came after a member of the campaign group Action Against Pylons had made a request for information relating to the proposed 58-mile overhead power line, known as the Cross Border Connection.

While Spen responded to the request, the ICO ruled the public authority had breached its duty to make environmental information available.

In addition, the ICO said Spen had breached a regulation concerning the refusal to disclose information.

The firm, a subsidiary of ScottishPower which owns and operates the electricity transmission and distribution network in central and southern Scotland, as well as some parts of England and Wales – has been ordered to do the whole request again, this time complying with the relevant regulations.

It comes after Spen was asked to give details of environmental experts it said it had consulted in drawing up options for the new overhead power line, along with details of dealings with local residents.

The Cross Border Connection proposes a new power line, which will run from a new substation to the north of Galashiels, to a point at the Scotland-England border, south of Newcastleton.

With electricity demand set to double in Britain by 2050, Spen says projects like it are needed to expand capacity on the grid, supporting new homes, businesses, clean heat and transport.

However, ICO said that Spen's response to a request for information on the project was “insufficient” and “against the spirit” of regulations which provide public access to environmental information.

The ICO ruling added that not only did Spen “fail to confirm or deny whether any relevant information is held”, the public authority also “appear to be trying to obfuscate the issue”.

It has now given the company 30 days from 25 September to make a fresh response to the request.

But Edward Kellow, chair of Action Against Pylons, said Spen's response was “indicative of a systematic policy of obstructing the public's right to information”.

Insisting the matter was “not down to single human error”, he stated: “If Spen is not transparent and does not act lawfully in the formal setting of these EIRs [Environmental Information Regulations], the public can have no confidence that they are acting lawfully in their wider engagements.”

Rory Steel, chair of Lauderdale Preservation Group, added: “Spen hopes to transform the Scottish Borders from an ancient, rural landscape to one of sprawling, light industry with powerlines, substations, giant battery farms, wind farms and solar installations.”

But he added: “Following this damning judgement by the ICO, we hope that Spen will now be honest and transparent in their dealings with the communities potentially affected.”

Spen has already said it has received almost 2,000 submissions from “the local community and beyond”, which it says will help shape its proposals for the new route as part of its first round of consultation on the Cross Border Connection.

Marlene Marimbe, environmental planner at SP Energy Networks, said: “The Cross Border Connection is part of the biggest rewiring of the electricity grid since it was first built.

“Delivering this project will strengthen energy security and help increase the resilience of the electricity network all across the country as we move towards an all-electric future.

“The next step for us is to carry out extensive and detailed investigation, including a full environmental impact assessment.

“This will enable us to evolve the proposals and move from a preferred route to a specific alignment with exact information on tower positions, access routes and how we will go about constructing the scheme, if consented.

“We are on-track to share the detailed proposals with the community at a further round of community consultation in late 2026.”

            The Island's Information commissioner's Office says the latest figures show fewer data breaches have been recorded - but they affect more people and are more serious.
        

Data from the ICO shows 52 data breaches were reported in the second quarter of this year.

They affected more than 2,200 people and 42 per cent of those involved personal data, or information that could be used for identity theft or financial crime.

The incidents were split evenly between the public and private sectors.

 The Laker News



ELMSDALE: When Mariah Snow became a mom, she never expected her parenting journey would lead to launching a fast-growing baby brand.

Today, her company Baby Bliss is making waves in the baby product market—thanks in part to the support she received from the Kings Hants CBDC.

Snow, based at 71 Park Road Unit D in the Elmsdale Business Park, designs safe, practical, and stylish products for babies and toddlers, including pacifiers, teethers, and feeding items.

What began as an idea sparked by a simple silicone bib has grown into a company selling in more than 200 independent retailers across Canada and on Amazon, where many of her items have earned the highly sought-after Amazon's Choice badge.

But Snow admits that getting to this stage wasn't easy. The biggest challenge? Inventory.

“We were at a point where demand was growing, but I didn't have the inventory to meet it,” she explained. “Without more stock, I couldn't grow.”

That's when she turned to the Kings Hants CBDC.

“They gave me funding for inventory, and it was honestly life-changing,” Snow said. “The very next month after receiving their support, our sales doubled. It also gave me the opportunity to open a physical location to handle the growth. None of this would have been possible without the CBDC.”

The CBDC's help extended beyond financing. Snow said the advice and mentorship provided were just as important as the funding itself.

“They helped me look more closely at my financials and focus on profitability. That kind of guidance has been huge for me as a young entrepreneur,” she said.

The results speak for themselves. Since incorporating in 2023, Baby Bliss has expanded rapidly, gaining national recognition and even earning Snow nominations for New Business of the Year and Young Entrepreneur of the Year through the East Hants & Districts Chamber of Commerce.

Looking ahead, Snow hopes to see Baby Bliss products reach larger national chains while continuing to launch new designs and grow her local presence.

She encourages other entrepreneurs with a dream to take advantage of what the CBDC offers.

“If you have a plan and the numbers to back it up, the CBDC will support you. They've been amazing, and I wouldn't be where I am today without them,” said Snow.

For Baby Bliss, the future is bright—and the Kings Hants CBDC has played a key role in helping the business, and its founder, thrive.

Are you an entrepreneur with a business dream? The Kings Hants CBDC can help with financing, advice, and support to bring your vision to life.

Just a week ago, Australian investors that piled into cryptocurrency markets were cheering another record for bitcoin. Fast forward to today, and those same highly leveraged traders are reeling after what has been described as the largest liquidation event in crypto history.

The violent reversal late last week was triggered by US President Donald Trump imposing an additional 100 per cent tariff on China and export controls on software. Bitcoin plunged 12 per cent to below $US110,000 over the weekend, just days after hitting a record high, while other major tokens such as Ether, Solana and XRP whipsawed.

(LILAMAX)- The cryptocurrency market suffered a major blow Saturday, with prices plunging in one of the sharpest single-day drops in recent history — erasing billions in value.

The crash followed the U.S. government's announcement of new tariffs on Chinese technology imports, which rattled global investors and triggered widespread sell-offs. Joshua Duckett, Director of Investigations at a crypto forensic firm, said mass liquidations by traders fueled the steep decline.

Meanwhile, new economic data highlights how dependent U.S. growth has become on the tech sector. Harvard economist Jason Furman reported that nearly all GDP growth in the first half of 2025 came from investment in data centers and information processing. Without those categories, GDP growth would have been just 0.1% — effectively stagnant.

In business news, AI-powered insurance firm Roadzen raised $11 million this quarter amid rising optimism about its artificial intelligence platform. The company uses AI, telematics, and data science to help insurers and auto manufacturers price risk more efficiently.

OpenAI says its latest models — GPT-5 Instant and GPT-5 Thinking — show a significant reduction in political bias. According to a new report titled Defining and Evaluating Political Bias in LLMs, the company has built an automated system to detect and minimize bias in its AI platforms as part of a broader effort to ensure neutrality.

The largest ether ETH$4,171.35 treasury company BitMine Technologies (BMNR) bought last week's dip in crypto prices, adding 202,037 tokens, $828 million at current prices, to its holdings, the firm reported on Monday.

""The crypto liquidation over the past few days created a price decline in ETH, which BitMine took advantage of,"" BitMine chairman Thomas Lee said in a statement.

""Volatility creates deleveraging and this can cause assets to trade at substantial discounts to fundamentals, or as we say, 'substantial discount to the future' and this creates advantages for investors, at the expense of traders,"" he added.

That purchase brought the firm's ETH holdings over 3 million, or 2.5% of the crypto's supply, halfway of the company's telegraphed goal to acquire 5% of all ETH on the market.

Following Friday's crypto flash crash, freshly created addresses that ""likely"" belonged to Bitmine withdrew over 128,718 ETH, or $480 million worth at the time, from exchange Kraken and prime broker FalconX, blockchain sleuth Lookonchain noted on Saturday. Before that, Lookonchain also attributed another 43,843 ETH worth of withdrawals to potentially being BitMine's.

While those addresses have not been annotated as BitMine's on blockchain intelligence platforms such as Arkham, the amount of tokens roughly line up with the company's updated holdings.

ETH tumbled from $4,500 on Thursday to as low as $3,500 on late Friday as trade tensions between U.S. and China flared up, with U.S. President Trump announcing 100% increase in tariffs against Chinese goods, responding to China tightening rare earth metal export controls. ETH rebounded to $4,100 as of Monday.

BMNR was up 4.3% in pre-market trading after closing Friday's session 11% lower at $52.47.

XRP clawed back $30 billion in market value after last week's tariff-driven collapse, ripping from $2.37 to $2.58 on explosive institutional volume. The rebound printed one of the year's heaviest sessions, confirming aggressive dip-buying as traders reposition ahead of fresh macro headlines.

The recovery follows a 50 % wipe-out triggered by President Trump's 100 % China-tariff declaration, which wiped $19 billion in crypto liquidations in minutes. Renewed buying has since restored confidence, with analysts eyeing a potential record weekly close above $3.12 that would mark XRP's strongest candle since inception. Broader markets remain risk-off—Dow –900, Nasdaq –820—but crypto desks flagged selective institutional inflows into XRP.

Structure now shows a clean ascending channel: $2.37 base, $2.59 lid. Sustained closes above $2.59 could open $2.70–$2.75, while failure to defend $2.50 risks retrace toward $2.42. Momentum remains bullish with institutional prints leading each breakout leg. Analysts highlight the breakout above $2.57 as confirmation of a near-term trend reversal; continued volume support keeps upside bias intact.

 Bitcoin Core launched its major v30 update on Saturday, with the community split over its drastic increase to the OP_RETURN data limit. 

Bitcoin Core developers saw a mixed reaction from the Bitcoin community as they announced the release of their v30 update, bringing forward a host of node-related changes to architecture, performance, and security.   The key changes brought forward in Bitcoin Core 30.0 are the introduction of optional encrypted connections between nodes for better privacy and the increase of the OP_RETURN data limit within Bitcoin Core software from 80 to 100,000 bytes, enabling a significantly larger amount of non-financial data to be embedded in Bitcoin transactions.   

“With the release of this new major version, versions 27.x and older are at ‘End of Life' and will no longer receive updates,” Sunday's announcement reads. 

While the update also included bug fixes, performance improvements and changes to fee rates, the biggest issue to stir debate in the community is the increase of the OP_Return limit.

Such a huge shift in the data limit enables the development of more sophisticated and data-hungry decentralized applications on the network, but has angered Bitcoin purists who argue that the network should be used only for financial transactions. 

While this wasn't a protocol change, the current debate sparks memories of the block size wars of 2017, which ultimately led to a Bitcoin hard fork in Bitcoin Cash. 

Some see the update as a good thing, such as Ark Labs Ecosystem Lead Alex Bergeron, who said via X on Friday that he intends “to use all of the additional OP_Return space and WILL use it to make Bitcoin more like Ethereum, except better.” 

While Satoshi Labs co-founder Pavol Rusnak also stated yesterday that he was opting for Bitcoin Core v30 due to having “great development team, peer-reviewed code,” and “sane engineering decisions.”

Others were not so optimistic, arguing that it goes against Bitcoin's fundamental principles of being a peer-to-peer electronic cash system and could lead to blockchain bloat, increased node operation costs and legal issues. 

One workaround that a significant number of node operators have already been utilizing is the alternative node software known as “knots,” as it enables them to enforce strict data size limits, such as 80 bytes, on transactions.   

“As a (hopefully) temporary measure, run Knots. I strongly recommend not upgrading to Core v30,” noted pioneer cryptographer Nick Szabo via X last week.

Earlier this month, Szabo raised concerns about the legal implications of the data limit increase, as node operators run the risk of hosting “illegal data.”

“Without adding safeguards to allow archival node operators to non-disruptively delete illegal content for which they will often be held criminally liable,” he posted on X on Oct. 2.  

The founder of knots, Luke Dashjr, has not commented on the update since it went live; however, he has been critical of the latest Bitcoin Core update. 

Data shows that a significant number of node operators are utilizing Knots software, with data from BitRef indicating that there are currently 5,114 Knots nodes, representing 21.48% of all Bitcoin nodes.

 Ether, BNB and Solana led as the crypto market powered back up after Friday's flash crash, with crypto treasury firm BitMine capitalizing on the dip. 

Update Oct. 13, 4:26 am UTC: This article has been updated to reflect that MARA Holdings bought 400 Bitcoin on Sunday.

Total crypto market capitalization soared back over $4 trillion on Sunday, with Ether (ETH), BNB (BNB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) posting double-digit gains after Friday's market crash that wiped out nearly $500 billion in crypto value. 

The three blue-chip coins have surged 10.5%, 13.6% and 12.5% over the last day, while Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Chainlink (LINK) are also up over 10%, CoinGecko data shows. 

Synthetix (SNX) briefly rose over 100% — eclipsing its pre-crash price level and even setting a new 2025 high — while a few other smaller-cap coins like Mantle (MNT) and Bittensor (TAO) increased over 30%.

The market crash, which saw Bitcoin fall from around $121,560 to below $103,000, was triggered by US President Donald Trump's 100% tariff on China, as part of an attempt to place export restrictions on rare earth minerals, which are crucial for creating computer chips. 

The market turmoil was exacerbated by Binance's front end briefly showing $0 prices on several altcoins, as well as the USDe synthetic dollar depegging on Binance due to an internal oracle issue.The crypto market started to recover around the time Trump said “not to worry about China,” adding that it wants to help China, not hurt it.

While prices haven't fully rebounded from Friday's crash, the recovery has many optimistic that Bitcoin (BTC) could still run toward $200,000 before the end of 2025.

Crypto market analyst Mister Crypto said that Bitcoin is retesting the golden cross —  a bullish technical pattern that has historically preceded rallies, including a 2,200% rise in 2017 and a 1,190% increase in 2020.

“The setup looks incredibly strong,” he wrote, adding that a confirmed breakout could “absolutely explode” Bitcoin's price in the coming weeks.

Crypto trader Alex Becker said there's a “very high chance” that this is the start of the bull market, while Jan3 founder Samson Mow added: “It's time for Bitcoin's next leg up.”

Another crypto analyst, “Mac,” said that while the risk-to-reward setup looks favorable, he doesn't expect a major surge in the immediate term, but speculated that “a little more upward chop” may ensue over the next week.

Bitcoin is currently trading at $115,585, still down 4.9% from the start of the dip and about 8.8% from its $126,080 set last Monday, CoinGecko data shows.

Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion Technologies, the largest corporate Ether treasury company, snapped up over 128,700 ETH worth $480 million shortly after the crash, crypto analytics platform Lookonchain noted.

BitMine's executive chairman, Tom Lee, said the stock market pullback was “overdue to an extent” given the market is up around 36% since April's lows. 

“I think it's a good flush,” Lee told CNBC, adding that any price fall without a real structural change is a “good buying opportunity.”

Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor hinted that his company bought the dip, posting a chart of Strategy's Bitcoin holdings to X on Saturday with the caption: “Don't Stop ₿elievin'”

Lookonchain also noted that Bitcoin miner MARA Holdings bought 400 Bitcoin worth $46.3 million on Sunday.

The Strange Saga of the Great Texas Space Shuttle Heist

Texas lawmakers want to move the Smithsonian's retired space shuttle to Houston. It's “a vanity project that is apt to destroy a near-priceless American treasure,” one historian says

By Dan Vergano edited by Jeanna Bryner

Even in retirement, the space shuttle Discovery exudes power, seen across a hangar crowded with planes and jets at its museum home in Chantilly, Va. Charred and worn from its record 39 missions to space, the stalwart of NASA's shuttle fleet evokes awe in its one-million-plus visitors every year.

But it won't be there for much longer, perhaps. Discovery, the showpiece of the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, an annex of the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum, may be removed from its retirement home at the hands of perhaps the most unstoppable force in the universe—politics.

In October came news reports of White House budget office plans to ship Discovery to Houston, removing it from its Smithsonian home at the behest of powerful Texas lawmakers. Uprooting the spacecraft, the workhorse of the space agency's shuttle fleet, from its Smithsonian owner was previously called “a heist” by Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois during a July Senate Appropriations Committee meeting.

The threatened move marks the latest turn of the screw on the Smithsonian's storied space shuttle, a saga that restarted this summer in one of the odder provisions of the Trump administration's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law in July. The 331-page tax-and-spending bill provided $85 million to ship the Discovery shuttle to Texas within the following 18 months—to Houston, home of NASA's Johnson Space Center (JSC) and its adjacent visitor center, the Space Center Houston museum, to be exact.

“Houston has long been the cornerstone of our nation's human space exploration program, and it's overdue for Space City to receive the recognition it deserves by bringing the Space Shuttle Discovery home,” said Senator John Cornyn of Texas in a July statement. Cornyn, who is currently in a tight Republican primary battle for his seat in 2026, called Houston the “rightful home” for Discovery in June.

“Exhibiting the Space Shuttle Discovery in Houston would significantly enhance educational opportunities and support the growth of our space economy,” said Space Center Houston president and CEO William Harris in a June letter to Cornyn and Texas's other senator, Ted Cruz. “Thank you for championing this transformative opportunity.”

Outside of Texas, the reviews have been lackluster.

“Such a move would be a waste of money—a vanity project that is apt to destroy a near-priceless American treasure,” says Matthew Hersch, a fellow in legal history at New York University School of Law and an associate of the Harvard University Department of the History of Science. “The removal of Discovery from the Smithsonian Institution would be a theft, by the federal government, of a $2-billion artifact from a private museum that owns it and has been maintaining it properly for over a decade.”

Art historian Lisa Strong of Georgetown University has similar sentiments: “Discovery is owned in trust by the American people,” she says. “If [Trump administration officials] go in and take it, that's what [Prime Minister Viktor] Orbán did in Hungary when he went and he took museum objects and gave them to his constituents.”

Removing Discovery from the Smithsonian would be an especially misguided move, Strong adds, because the institution is a world leader in preserving engineering artifacts for future study. The Houston museum simply lacks the Smithsonian's preservation expertise, she says.

At the end of September, Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, a former astronaut, joined with Virginia's senators and Durbin to oppose the movein a letter to the Senate's overall spending committee. “It is worth noting that there is little evidence of broad public demand for such a move,” they wrote, before warning that the transfer would present “profound financial challenges” and “inevitably and irreparably” damage the shuttle that Kelly flew onboard twice.

First launched on August 30, 1984, Discovery was the third operational space shuttle NASA built. With more flights under its belt than any of the other four shuttles that went to space, it is referred to as the “Champion of the Fleet.” It launched the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and was the first of the pack to be relaunched by NASA after both the 1986 Challenger and 2003 Columbia disasters. Its final mission ended on March 9, 2011. A month later, then NASA administrator Charles Bolden announced that space shuttles Discovery, Atlantis and Endeavour would respectively retire at the Udvar-Hazy Center, the Kennedy Space Center and the California Science Center in Los Angeles. New York City's Intrepid Museum would receive Enterprise, an Orbiter test vehicle. Bolden said at the time that he chose the locations to “provide the greatest number of people with the best opportunity to share in the history and accomplishments of NASA's remarkable Space Shuttle Program.”

Not everyone celebrated the decision, including lawmakers from Ohio, Utah and Texas, the latter of whom decried it as the “Houston shuttle snub.” In response to complaints from then senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio (home to the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force, near Dayton), NASA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) initiated an investigation of the decision. Released in August 2011, the report found that Bolden and the space agency had followed NASA's internal rankings of museums, based on factors such as attendance, funding and museum certification, without political interference (although NASA had delayed the announcement in order for a space-agency-related bill to first pass without any uproar, at the request of the head of a congressional committee). The three winners ranked highest, the OIG report found. Houston, meanwhile, ranked among the lowest entrants, losing out largely because of the museum's poor funding. “I'm just going to be blunt,” Bolden says. “The reason they were so poorly rated was because Space Center Houston was getting zero support from the city of Houston.”

Other reasons listed included then lower attendance and a lack of international tourists to carry abroad an impression of U.S. space prowess from a visit. Bolden told the OIG in 2011 (as well as in his interview with Scientific American for this article) that Houston would have been his personal choice to house a shuttle. But he was obligated to follow the rankings and the process NASA had chosen for its museum selection. More than a decade later, the retired Marine general and NASA astronaut still sounds surprised at how little interest Texas then had in paying the estimated cost of $42.8-million (in 2011 dollars) for transporting and housing a shuttle.

Bolden was a founding member on the board of directors of Space Center Houston, which opened in 1992, acting as its astronaut office representative from his time at JSC. “We traveled all over the country, trying to find donors and supporters who would help us open a visitor center in Houston,” he says. “And we got zero support from the city of Houston or the state of Texas. They weren't interested. They were interested in football and other kinds of things but definitely not in putting any money into the Johnson Space Center.”

Now Texas seems to want customers willing to pay $30 for tickets to the Houston space museum. Houston is hurting, as space cities go, with JSC looking at budget cuts demanded by the Trump administration, journalist Joe Pappalardo noted in Texas Monthly in September. “If Houston manages to hold its Space City title, it could have powerful political friends to thank,” he wrote, referring to Ted Cruz, who chairs the Senate's spending committee, and Representative Brian Babin, whose district includes JSC. Cruz and Babin have also been instrumental in bringing $4.1 billion in moon-mission cash and $300 million in planned “improvements” to the space center in Houston though the July spending bill.

Moving the shuttle is likely to be tricky and risky. Its 24,300 ceramic tiles, for example, are made of a glass-coated silica that is 90 percent air. They're so fragile that fingertip pressure can break them. Workers have cracked tiles by bumping the objects with their head or with a broom handle while sweeping underneath. Roughly four out of five tiles on Discovery have already been weakened during one or more of the shuttle's 39 re-entries from space. A square foot of tiles cost $10,000 to make and install back when they were being manufactured in the 1980s. That capability has long been scrapped.

Smithsonian museum personnel have estimated it will cost $305 million to transport Discovery to Houston and safely house it in a new display. Simply relocating the shuttle, the costs of building a facility to safely house and display it aside, will cost $120 million to $150 million, according to a joint Smithsonian and NASA estimate sent to the White House budget office in late September.

A July Congressional Research Service report noted that a private company has suggested that it could instead move the shuttle by ground and barge from Virginia to Houston for $8 million, far less than the Smithsonian's estimate.

Yet a highly experienced expert on transporting space shuttles calls that number laughable, speaking anonymously for fear of sparking calls for his own investigation from Cornyn. “There is no meaningful way to move this vehicle at this point without reconstituting a huge amount of capability that we shut down 10 years ago,” the expert says. Strong agrees. “I'm pretty sure we know who knows how to move, and care for, museum artifacts,” she says. “I think I'd go with the Smithsonian's estimate.”

In a statement to Chron in an article published on October 6, Cornyn's office derided the cost concern, saying, “Discovery belongs in Houston, and will make the journey there safely, securely, and efficiently in accordance with the law whether the woke Smithsonian and its cronies in Congress like it or not.” (In an e-mail to Scientific American, Tatum Wallace, Cornyn's press secretary, said that statement came in response to “the Smithsonian spreading lies about the logistics for moving Discovery.”)

On that date, Cornyn and Cruz sent a letter to the leaders of Senate's appropriations committee, urging them not to pause spending on Discovery's relocation over cost concerns. “As part of its opposition effort, the Smithsonian has disseminated misinformation about the logistics of the move, falsely claiming that the shuttle's wings would need to be removed for transport, a claim not supported by industry experts,” the Texas senators wrote.

But transporting Discovery by highway and barge to Houston is simply a nonstarter, according to the expert. It's too big to fit under highway overpasses, meaning the fragile spacecraft will need to be taken apart and transported by truck, something now reportedly under consideration by the White House. In October NASA and the Smithsonian warned Congress that such plans “would likely require taking it apart” and could irreparably damage the shuttle. Even taken apart, an intercoastal waterway barge trip from Washington D.C. to Houston would be an epic engineering feat because shuttle tiles are easily damaged by moisture. (And the last time a barge trip was tried, in 2012, the Enterprise suffered minor damage from a railroad bridge support as it was being moved between New York City and Jersey City, N.J.)

That leaves rolling Discovery from the Udvar-Hazy Center to the nearby Dulles International Airport (there is a connecting road between them), loading it onto a Boeing 747 and flying it to Texas as the most feasible way to move the shuttle. But that strategy has problems, too. Only a handful of people alive even know the necessary procedure for retracting the shuttle's landing gear, and they might not care to unretire for the job. The Air and Space Museum's James S. McDonnell Space Hangar, now centered around Discovery, has two hangar doors but would need a hole cut for the shuttle's tail to exit. “Just getting it ready is going to take you a couple months and several million dollars just to make sure you don't hurt it when you move it,” the technical expert says.

What's more, the two 747's configured to carry the space shuttles were decommissioned more than a decade ago. One, Shuttle Carrier Aircraft 911, is parked out in the desert in Palmdale, Calif., and could be inspected to fly for about $10 million, with about that same amount needed for four new engines. It would likely cost a few million dollars more to reinforce it again for carrying the shuttle. Pilots would need to be retrained in the unique takeoff procedure required to counterbalance the 170,000-pound shuttle squatting atop the jet. And ironically enough, the second 747 was cut up and moved to Space Center Houston, where it was rebuilt for exhibition, making it unrecoverable.

Houston's Ellington Airport is only eight to 10 miles by road from Space Center Houston, but safely moving a space shuttle isn't easy or cheap. Moving the space shuttle Endeavour just 12 miles from Los Angeles International Airport to the California Science Center was an arduous engineering feat that cost roughly $10 million. The shuttles “were designed to be moved carefully by a large crew of trained people using a lot of specialized ground equipment,” says the technical expert. “That's all been scrapped.” That includes self-propelled modular transporters and special slings that carried the shuttles, attachable only at seven points on the fuselage.

The Big Beautiful Bill requires the space vehicle must be transferred by January 4, 2027. That's a little less than 15 months away, meaning all that planning—and spending—needs to start now.

The space shuttle Discovery carried atop a Boeing 747 aircraft on its 2012 transfer flight to the Smithsonian.

An even bigger problem for moving Discovery to Houston is that NASA doesn't own the shuttle anymore. The Smithsonian took title of the spacecraft from the space agency in 2012. Noting this, the Congressional Research Service wrote in its report that NASA's ability to purloin Smithsonian space artifacts “is unclear and may be subject to question.”

“The Smithsonian Institution owns the Space Shuttle Orbiter Discovery and holds it and all of its collections in trust for the nation,” says Alison Wood of the Smithsonian Institution, who noted the museum's charge to preserve artifacts for future generations of scholarship and presentation. “The Smithsonian will carefully evaluate any request to move Discovery in light of these obligations.”

Steven Dick, a former NASA chief historian, acknowledged that politics always plays a role in these types of decisions. Both JSC, where astronauts lived, trained and managed flights, and the Smithsonian, the official depository for NASA artifacts, have claims to the shuttle, he says. But in an outdoor shed, JSC already has a Saturn V moon rocket on display, something the Smithsonian lacks. “So one might whimsically say JSC could swap their Saturn V for Discovery, but that would cost even more money,” Dick says.

“This will be the first time ever in the history of the Smithsonian that someone has taken one of their displays and forcibly taken possession of it,” Durbin said during the Senate Appropriations Committee meeting in July. “What are we doing here? They don't have the right in Texas to claim this.”

Scientists Map Microbiome Hidden Deep inside Tree Trunks

Scientists have mapped microbe populations in human guts, deep-sea ecosystems and even clouds. Yet the microbial communities inside tree trunks have remained largely unseen until now. For a recent study in Nature, researchers analyzed about 150 trees to map the communities of microbes living in 16 species. They estimate that a single mature tree hosts about one trillion bacteria in its trunk “microbiome,” with distinct communities living in different layers.

Most intriguing, the scientists found anaerobic bacteria—bacteria that don't consume oxygen—producing methane in the deep heartwood. “It turned out what's living inside the trees was really different from what we found anywhere else in the forest,” says the study's co-lead author, Jonathan Gewirtzman, an ecosystem ecologist at Yale University. The trees' interior population, he says, was more akin to that of a wetland.

For a long time plant tissues were thought to be sterile. When that was disproved in the early 1900s, researchers focused largely on roots, where many bacteria and fungi are involved in soil-based nutrient cycling. Whatever might be living within a plant's shoots, trunks and leaves was mostly ignored.

To examine the trunk's hidden biome, Gewirtzman and his colleagues drilled into living tree trunks to extract thin core samples, which they immediately froze with dry ice to halt microbial activity. They then separated the cores into sapwood and heartwood (a tree trunk's middle and innermost layers, respectively), ground the frozen wood into powder and sequenced the bacteria in each layer. To study the activity of living microbes, they also sealed holes drilled into trees and later measured gases such as methane and nitrous oxide emitted by different layers.

The researchers learned that when trees are evolutionarily close, they tend to have similar microbiomes. And the team found a surprise deep inside the trunks: “In the older and inner heartwood,” Gewirtzman says, “we saw microbes more like what you'd find in a wetland—anaerobic bacteria and methane producers,” species suited to a waterlogged and oxygen-poor environment. Some bacteria in the outer layers may consume part of that methane, the researchers found, but the study suggests that methane-producing and nitrous oxide–producing bacteria inside trees could still create greenhouse gas emissions scientists should figure into calculations.

“It is a really nice study, as they did something different from most: comparing the inner wood versus the outer wood,” says plant microbiologist Sharon Lafferty Doty of the University of Washington. Doty adds that chemicals used in modern agriculture erode the health of plant microbiomes. “By studying these natural plant-microbe partnerships, we can understand which bacteria are important and active to add back into our agricultural system,” she says.

 A one-of-a-kind piece of medical tech could heal diseases that have stumped researchers for decades. 

An estimated 1.1 million Americans are currently living with Parkinson's disease—a neurodegenerative condition that causes tremors, limb stiffness, and mobility issues. Despite how common Parkinson's is, researchers still aren't quite sure what exactly makes neurons in the brain deteriorate, which causes the disease.

While experts have developed treatments to mitigate symptoms of the condition, the options are either invasive or short-lasting. But for the first time ever, researchers have developed a non-invasive way to target neurons in the brains of Parkinson's patients. In their recent paper, published in the journal Nature Communications, a team from University College London and Oxford University debuted an ultrasound helmet that can accurately send pulses to the deepest parts of the brain to influence how cells communicate. 

The helmet is the most recent iteration of transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS), a treatment method that has gained attention in recent years for its ability to modify how neurons fire signals. TUS works by sending out targeted sound waves at frequencies greater than 20kHz, or higher than the human ear can detect. As the pulses travel through the body, they emit energy that vibrates the cells, rapidly stretching and compressing the tissues. The devices come in all shapes and sizes, with some that look like headgear and others that resemble typical ultrasound wands. Previous applications of TUS were limited, as they were imprecise and too weak to target areas deeper in the brain. Parkinson's in particular damages neurons deep in a region of the midbrain called the substantia nigra, which is responsible for producing dopamine, which affects movement and muscle tone. 

The new helmet corrects these flaws with 256 small, tubular probes and a plastic face mask. The many wired probes allow the operator to send a focused ultrasound beam to specific parts of the patient's brain, while the mask keeps the patient still, further improving precision. The updates are what make the new ultrasound helmet capable of targeting areas 1,000 times smaller than traditional ultrasound technology can. 

And the helmet isn't just exciting in theory, either. The team's recent study proved the one-of-a-kind device is capable of reaching deeper parts of the brain more accurately than previous technology. To test the helmet, the team focused on a part of the brain that is unrelated to Parkinson's, but one that they could see immediate effects on. The area they targeted is called the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), a section of the thalamus involved in processing visual information. Participants observed a flashing checkerboard, and an fMRI revealed increased activity in their visual cortexes, indicating the ultrasound beams were successfully hitting the LGN. A second experiment revealed extended decreased activity in the same area. Researchers say both these tests show promising results for eventually harnessing the power of TUS to control symptoms like hand tremors.  

“Clinically, this new technology could transform treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's disease, depression, and essential tremor, offering unprecedented precision in targeting specific brain circuits that play key roles in these conditions,”  Bradley Treeby, PhD, senior author of the study, says in a press release. 

Next, the team plans to test the helmet on regions of the brain associated with the aforementioned conditions as well as stroke recovery, schizophrenia, and chronic pain, according to an interview with The Guardian. The researchers hope the new method will eventually work alongside or even replace invasive treatments, like deep brain stimulation (DBS), which requires a surgically implanted device similar to a pacemaker deep in the brain. 

Perhaps most excitingly, the team anticipates progress will be made quickly, estimating seeing the first clinical application within the next decade. Should the device continue to prove successful, it could finally be the cure to many conditions that have long stumped researchers.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

On his quest to find the mythical Seven Cities of Gold somewhere in the American southwest, Spanish explorer Vázquez de Coronado left behind some materials after a pit stop that, while perhaps an afterthought to him, included what is now a major piece of archaeological and weapon history in the United States.

A team of researchers uncovered a bronze cannon, or “wall gun,” in Arizona and, using radiocarbon dating among other dating techniques, pegged the 480-year-old device to the Coronado expedition. By virtue of its age, the cannon is the oldest firearm ever discovered within the continental confines of the United States. 

In a study published in the International Journal of Historical Archaeology, a team of researchers revealed the 2020 find from the floor of a Spanish stone-and-adobe structure in Arizona at the former settlement of San Geronimo III in what is now Nogales, Arizona, for the first time. 

Radiocarbon dating places the gun in the same time period of the 1539-1542 Coronado expedition, led by the Spanish explorer in hopes of finding the gold cities of Cibola, which were rumored by conquistadors to exist somewhere in what would become the southwestern U.S. 

“This wall gun is the first gun known to be associated with the Coronado expedition and is the oldest firearm ever found within the continental USA,” the study authors wrote, “and perhaps the oldest cannon currently known on the continent.”

This was no small pistol, though. At 42 inches in length and weighing 40 pounds, researchers say it would have taken two people to operate. But that apparently wasn't necessary. There were no bullets found near the gun—the team did uncover plenty of broken swords and daggers, fishhooks, pottery, and other items—and the lack of residue in the barrel indicated it was never fired. 

“I was in shock,” Deni Seymour, archaeologist and lead author, told the Washington Post about the find. “It was just an odd feeling that I rarely get.”

A wall gun is considered a beefed-up musket and got its name as it was often used at a building's wall or a ship's railing. While it's not what we traditionally think of when we hear the word, it is also referred to as a cannon, largely because of the smoothbore nature of the barrels. The 480-year-old gun was likely built in the early 1500s and brought on the expedition after manufacturing in either Mexico or the Caribbean, the study suggests. It was then abandoned at the site hundreds of years ago. 

“An artifact like this can connect people to the past, to history, and really stirs their imagination,” Seymour said. 

The expedition led by Coronado was a Spanish effort that started in Mexico and explored the American southwest with the goal of finding the Seven Cities of Cibola, which were proven to be just a myth. While no gold-adorned cities were ever located, the explorers became the first Europeans to see the Grand Canyon. 

Seymour told the Post that since the initial discovery in 2020, she has uncovered a second, similar cannon. “The cannon is pretty darn wonderful, but each artifact we find and the context of them has the potential to convey a really interesting part of the story,” she said. “And that's what's fun about it. That's what's interesting, and that's what keeps me going.”

The public dig uncovered artifacts including an incense bowl, a piece of a military helmet, and lost coins.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

A quaint estate in the West Midlands of England sits atop a treasure trove of Roman artifacts. The potential finds are so plentiful, in fact, that the National Trust—owners of the estate—saw fit to invite the public to work alongside archaeologists on a dig in September. That dig that uncovered Roman artifacts in the form of an incense bowl, a decorative metal acorn, and a piece of a military helmet. 

Located in rural Shropshire, the estate sits atop prehistoric and medieval settlements, and Roman roads and buildings. To help connect the bountiful history of the site with the local community, the National Trust launched Attingham Unearthed in 2025—a pilot archaeological project testing a new model of research. The aim? Create a hands-on, sustainable archaeology experience. 

Digging out Roman treasure sure helps a pilot project take root. 

In the debut effort, teams of volunteers worked alongside professionals at the site where Roman villas were recently uncovered, bringing school children, youth groups, and community organizations in for a public dig. The two-week effort sifted through three trenches and multiple test pits to reveal the Roman artifacts. “This fortnight has made a significant, and important, contribution to our understanding of Wroxeter and its immediate surroundings,” said Roger White, an expert at the nearby Wroxeter Roman City, according to the BBC. “The dig may have been small in scale, but its impact is enormous.” 

The dig uncovered a decorative metal acorn (thought to have once been attached to a piece of Roman furniture such as a small box), the base of a ceramic candlestick, the handle of a metal helmet that was likely once used by the Roman military, coins, and a 2,000-year-old decorative incense bowl. The bowl may have once been part of a Roman shrine on the site, and the coins date to around 150 B.C.E., prior to Roman occupation of the region.

“For the first time, visitors could book a place to dig alongside archaeologists who have been testing the results of the geophysical survey and ensuring our nature recovery ambitions work in harmony with our hidden heritage,” said Mark Agnew, general manager of the Attingham Estate, according to the Shropshire Star. 

The volunteers were involved with surveying, washing finds, and test pit excavations. “The work aims not only to connect people with the past, but also to deepen understanding of the wider history of Attingham Estate,” Agnew said. “This pilot project marks an exciting new approach for the trust.”

The estate was selected to launch the project due to the evidence of human interaction there over such a long time. “Recent surveys have revealed high archaeological potential, making it the ideal place to begin,” the trust said in a statement. “This project will act as a proof of concept. Everything learned at Attingham, what worked, what needs refining, will shape how the National Trust delivers archaeological engagement in the future.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","New research reveals how ADHD sparks extraordinary creativity","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251012054608.htm","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 07:24:44 GMT","

New research has found that ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) is linked to higher levels of creativity, and that this creative advantage may stem from a stronger tendency for the mind to wander. The findings, presented at the ECNP congress in Amsterdam, mark the first study to explain how ADHD and creativity are connected.

Lead researcher Han Fang (from the Radboud University Medical Centre, the Netherlands) explained:

""Previous research pointed to mind wandering as a possible factor linking ADHD and creativity, but until now no study has directly examined this connection. We conducted two studies, utilizing 2 different groups of ADHD patients and healthy controls, one from a European group curated by the ECNP, and a second study from a UK group. In total there were 750 participants. Separately analyzing results from 2 independent groups means that we can have greater confidence in the results.""

The team explored how ADHD traits, creativity, and functional challenges interact, focusing on the influence of mind wandering. Both groups displayed typical ADHD traits, including inattention, impulsivity, and frequent shifts in focus away from the task at hand. In both studies, participants with more pronounced ADHD symptoms also reported higher levels of mind wandering.

Mind wandering refers to moments when attention drifts away from what a person is doing and turns inward to self-generated thoughts. Everyone experiences this to some extent, but it occurs more frequently in individuals with ADHD.

Han Fang added:

""Previous researchers have been able to distinguish two different types of mind wandering. It can be a loss of concentration, where your mind may drift from subject to subject. This is 'spontaneous mind-wandering'. Another type is 'deliberate mind wandering', where people give themselves the freedom to drift off-subject, where they 'allow their thoughts to take a different course'. Psychiatrists have developed ways of measuring how much people are subject to these different tendencies.""

The researchers also measured creativity in both groups (there are standards ways of measuring this, for example by asking people to find a creative use for an everyday object). They then looked at how creativity was associated with the different types of mind wandering.

Dr. Han Fang said:

""We found that people with more ADHD traits such as lack of attention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity, score higher on creative achievements in both studies. This supports previous research. Additionally, we found that mind wandering, particularly deliberate mind wandering, where people allow their ""thoughts to wander on purpose,"" was associated with greater creativity in people with ADHD. This suggests that mind wandering may be an underlying factor connecting ADHD and creativity.

This may have practical implications, for both psychoeducation and treatment. For psychoeducation, specially designed programs or courses that teach individuals how to utilize their spontaneous ideas, for example turning them into creative outputs, could help individuals with ADHD traits harness the benefits of mind wandering. For treatment, ADHD-tailored mindfulness-based interventions that seek to decrease spontaneous mind wandering or transform it into more deliberate forms may reduce functional impairments and enhance treatment outcomes. This is the first time this link has been investigated, so we need to see more studies which confirm the findings.""

Commenting, K.P. Lesch (Professor of Molecular Psychiatry, University of Würzburg, Germany) said:

""Mind wandering is one of the critical resources on which the remarkable creativity of high-functioning ADHD individuals is based. This makes them such an incredibly valuable asset for our society and the future of our planet.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This experimental “super vaccine” stopped cancer cold in the lab","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251013040323.htm","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 13:08:16 GMT","

Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst have shown that their nanoparticle-based vaccine can successfully prevent several aggressive cancers in mice, including melanoma, pancreatic cancer, and triple-negative breast cancer. Depending on the cancer type, up to 88% of vaccinated mice stayed tumor-free (depending on the cancer), and the vaccine also reduced -- and in some cases completely prevented -- the spread of cancer throughout the body.

""By engineering these nanoparticles to activate the immune system via multi-pathway activation that combines with cancer-specific antigens, we can prevent tumor growth with remarkable survival rates,"" says Prabhani Atukorale, assistant professor of biomedical engineering in the Riccio College of Engineering at UMass Amherst and corresponding author on the paper.

Atukorale had previously shown that her nanoparticle-based drug design could shrink or eliminate tumors in mice. The new findings reveal that this approach can also prevent cancer from forming in the first place.

In the first experiment, her team combined the nanoparticle system with well-studied melanoma peptides (called an antigen, similar to how a flu shot typically contains parts of the inactivated flu virus). This formulation activated immune cells known as T cells, training them to detect and destroy melanoma cells. Three weeks later, the vaccinated mice were exposed to melanoma.

Eighty percent of the mice that received the ""super adjuvant"" nanoparticle vaccine remained tumor-free and survived the entire study period (250 days). In contrast, all of the mice that received traditional vaccines, non-nanoparticle formulations, or no vaccine at all developed tumors and died within 35 days.

The vaccine also stopped cancer from spreading to the lungs. When the mice were systemically exposed to melanoma cells to mimic metastasis, none of the nanoparticle-vaccinated mice developed lung tumors, while every other mouse did.

""Metastases across the board is the highest hurdle for cancer,"" says Atukorale. ""The vast majority of tumor mortality is still due to metastases, and it almost trumps us working in difficult-to-reach cancers, such as melanoma and pancreatic cancer.""

Atukorale refers to this protection as ""memory immunity."" ""That is a real advantage of immunotherapy, because memory is not only sustained locally,"" she explains. ""We have memory systemically, which is very important. The immune system spans the entire geography of the body.""

The first phase of testing used a vaccine with known antigens designed for melanoma. However, creating antigens for each cancer type can require extensive genome sequencing or bioinformatics analysis. To simplify the process, the researchers tested a second version using killed tumor cells, called tumor lysate, derived directly from the cancer itself. Mice vaccinated with this nanoparticle lysate vaccine were later exposed to melanoma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, or triple-negative breast cancer cells.

The results were impressive: 88% of mice with pancreatic cancer, 75% with breast cancer, and 69% with melanoma rejected tumor formation. Furthermore, all mice that remained tumor-free after vaccination also resisted metastasis when exposed systemically to cancer cells.

""The tumor-specific T-cell responses that we are able to generate -- that is really the key behind the survival benefit,"" says Griffin Kane, postdoctoral research associate at UMass Amherst and first author on the paper. ""There is really intense immune activation when you treat innate immune cells with this formulation, which triggers these cells to present antigens and prime tumor-killing T cells.""

This robust T-cell response is possible because of the particular nanoparticle design of the vaccine.

Vaccines -- regardless the target disease -- contain two primary components: The antigen and the adjuvant. The antigen is the piece of the disease-causing pathogen (in this study, cancer cells) that the immune system can be trained to target. The adjuvant is a substance that activates the immune system to recognize the antigen, treat it as a foreign intruder and eliminate it.

The Atukorale Lab draws inspiration from how pathogens naturally stimulate the immune system. To mount a strong immune response, the body requires multiple ""danger"" signals triggered through different pathways. ""In recent years, we have come to understand how important the selection of the adjuvant is because it drives the second signal that is needed for the correct priming of T and B cells,"" says Atukorale.

However, just like oil and water, many of the most promising adjuvants for cancer immunotherapy do not mix well at the molecular level. To overcome this, the Atukorale Lab has engineered a lipid nanoparticle-based ""super adjuvant"" capable of stably encapsulating and co-delivering two distinct immune adjuvants that activate immunity in a coordinated, synergistic way.

The researchers say that their design offers a platform approach that could be used across multiple cancer types.

The researchers envision that this platform can be applied to create both therapeutic and preventative regimens, particularly for individuals at high risk for cancer. This is an idea that Atukorale and Kane have turned into a startup called NanoVax Therapeutics.

""The real core technology that our company has been founded on is this nanoparticle and this treatment approach,"" says Kane. ""This is a platform that Prabhani developed. The startup lets us pursue these translational efforts with the ultimate goal of improving patients' lives.""

Next, Atukorale and Kane plan to extend this technology to a therapeutic vaccine and have already taken the initial de-risking steps in translation.

Atukorale and Kane credit the Biomedical Engineering department and the Institute for Applied Life Sciences at UMass Amherst, UMass Chan Medical School, and funding from the National Institutes of Health for their support.

The study was published in the October 9 edition of Cell Reports Medicine.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists found a smarter Mediterranean diet that cuts diabetes risk by 31%","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251012054621.htm","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 03:49:14 GMT","

Eating a Mediterranean-style diet with fewer calories, adding moderate physical activity, and receiving professional guidance for weight management can lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 31%. That is the key finding of PREDIMED-Plus, a large clinical trial led in Spain by the University of Navarra together with more than 200 researchers from 22 universities, hospitals, and research institutes. The project was carried out in over 100 primary care centers within Spain's National Health System.

Launched in 2013 after the University of Navarra received an Advanced Grant of over €2 million from the European Research Council (ERC), PREDIMED-Plus is the largest nutrition trial ever conducted in Europe. Between 2014 and 2016, additional institutions joined the effort, bringing total funding above 15 million euros. Most of the support came from the Carlos III Health Institute (ISCIII) and the Center for Biomedical Research Network (CIBER), through its divisions on Physiopathology of Obesity and Nutrition (CIBEROBN), Epidemiology and Public Health (CIBERESP), and Diabetes and Associated Metabolic Diseases (CIBERDEM).

The study, published in Annals of Internal Medicine, followed 4,746 adults between the ages of 55 and 75 who were overweight or obese and had metabolic syndrome but no prior history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Over six years, researchers compared two groups. One group adopted a calorie-reduced Mediterranean diet (about 600 fewer kilocalories per day), engaged in moderate exercise such as brisk walking and strength and balance training, and received professional counseling. The other group continued a traditional Mediterranean diet without calorie limits or exercise advice.

The results revealed that the participants who followed the calorie-reduced diet and exercise plan not only reduced their diabetes risk but also lost more weight and trimmed more from their waistlines. On average, they lost 3.3 kg and 3.6 cm from their waist, compared to 0.6 kg and 0.3 cm in the control group. This translated to preventing about three new cases of type 2 diabetes for every 100 participants -- a meaningful benefit for public health.

""Diabetes is the first solid clinical outcome for which we have shown -- using the strongest available evidence -- that the Mediterranean diet with calorie reduction, physical activity and weight loss is a highly effective preventive tool,"" said Miguel Ángel Martínez-González, Professor of Preventive Medicine and Public Health at the University of Navarra, Adjunct Professor of Nutrition at Harvard University, and one of the principal investigators of the project. ""Applied at scale in at-risk populations, these modest and sustained lifestyle changes could prevent thousands of new diagnoses every year. We hope soon to show similar evidence for other major public health challenges.""

Type 2 Diabetes: A Preventable Global Epidemic

According to the International Diabetes Federation, type 2 diabetes now affects over 530 million people around the world. Its rise is fueled by urbanization (unhealthy diets, sedentary lifestyles, reduced physical activity), an aging population, and increasing rates of overweight and obesity. In Spain, an estimated 4.7 million adults live with diabetes -- mostly type 2 -- giving the country one of the highest rates in Europe, where total cases exceed 65 million. In the United States, roughly 38.5 million people have diabetes, and the disease carries some of the highest per-patient healthcare costs worldwide. Experts emphasize that prevention is crucial to slow this escalating crisis, which greatly increases the risk of heart, kidney, and metabolic complications.

""The Mediterranean diet acts synergistically to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammation. With PREDIMED-Plus, we demonstrate that combining calorie control and physical activity enhances these benefits,"" explained Miguel Ruiz-Canela, Professor and Chair of Preventive Medicine and Public Health Department at the University of Navarra's School of Medicine and first author of the study. ""It is a tasty, sustainable and culturally accepted approach that offers a practical and effective way to prevent type 2 diabetes -- a global disease that is, to a large extent, avoidable.""

International Relevance and Support for a Realistic and Scalable Strategy

Annals of Internal Medicine accompanied the publication with an editorial by Sharon J. Herring and Gina L. Tripicchio, nutrition and public health experts at Temple University (Philadelphia, USA). They praised the intervention's clinical relevance and its potential as a preventive model for type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, they warn that replicating similar strategies outside the Mediterranean context -- such as in the U.S. -- requires overcoming structural barriers, including unequal access to healthy foods, the limitations of the urban environment, and the lack of professional guidance. In this scenario, they advocate strengthening public policies that promote more nutritious and more equitable environments. At a time when new drugs against obesity and diabetes are grabbing headlines, PREDIMED-Plus demonstrates that modest, sustained lifestyle changes can still deliver powerful health benefits.

The PREDIMED-Plus project (2013-2024), which involves different patients, is a continuation of the PREDIMED study (2003-2010). This study demonstrated that following a Mediterranean diet enriched with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease by 30%. Researchers emphasize that primary care providers can integrate the new intervention as a sustainable, cost-efficient strategy to prevent type 2 diabetes on a large scale.

Participating Institutions

The PREDIMED-Plus trial has assembled a broad network of investigators from across Spain. In order of the number of participants, the study included researchers from the following institutions: the University of Navarra and the Navarra Health Service (2 centers), Hospital Clínic de Barcelona (2 centers), University of Valencia, Rovira i Virgili University (Reus), IMIM-Hospital del Mar, Miguel Hernández University (Alicante), Son Espases Hospital (Palma de Mallorca), University of Malaga, Reina Sofía Hospital (Córdoba) and University of Granada. In addition, Bioaraba and the UPV/EHU (Vitoria), the University of the Balearic Islands, the Hospital Virgen de la Victoria (Malaga), the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, the University of Leon, the Primary Health Care District of Seville, the Fundación Jiménez Díaz (Madrid), the Hospital de Bellvitge, the Hospital Clínico San Carlos (Madrid), the University of Jaen, and the IMDEA Food Institute (Madrid) have also participated.

The project also benefited from international collaboration with the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (USA). Most of the participating researchers are affiliated with the CIBEROBN, CIBERESP, or CIBERDEM research networks.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Fentanyl overdoses among seniors surge 9,000% — A hidden crisis few saw coming","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251012054606.htm","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 06:49:14 GMT","

Fatal overdoses among adults 65 and older involving fentanyl mixed with stimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamines have risen dramatically, climbing 9,000% in the past eight years. The rate now mirrors that seen in younger adults, according to findings presented at the ANESTHESIOLOGY® 2025 annual meeting.

This research is one of the first to use Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data to reveal that older adults -- often left out of overdose analyses -- are increasingly part of the national surge in fentanyl-stimulant deaths. People in this age group face higher risks of overdose because many manage chronic illnesses, take multiple medications, and metabolize drugs more slowly as they age.

Experts describe the opioid epidemic as unfolding in four distinct ""waves,"" each tied to a different drug driving fatal overdoses: prescription opioids in the 1990s, heroin beginning around 2010, fentanyl taking hold in 2013, and a combination of fentanyl and stimulants emerging in 2015.

""A common misconception is that opioid overdoses primarily affect younger people,"" said Gab Pasia, M.A., lead author of the study and a medical student at the University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine. ""Our analysis shows that older adults are also impacted by fentanyl-related deaths and that stimulant involvement has become much more common in this group. This suggests older adults are affected by the current fourth wave of the opioid crisis, following similar patterns seen in younger populations.""

To conduct the study, researchers examined 404,964 death certificates listing fentanyl as a cause of death from 1999 to 2023, using data from the CDC Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) system. Of those deaths, 17,040 involved adults 65 and older, while 387,924 were among adults aged 25 to 64.

Between 2015 and 2023, fentanyl-related deaths rose from 264 to 4,144 among older adults (a 1,470% increase) and from 8,513 to 64,694 among younger adults (a 660% increase). Within the older population, deaths involving both fentanyl and stimulants grew from 8.7% (23 of 264 fentanyl deaths) in 2015 to 49.9% (2,070 of 4,144) in 2023 -- a staggering 9,000% rise. In comparison, among younger adults, fentanyl-stimulant deaths rose from 21.3% (1,812 of 8,513) to 59.3% (38,333 of 64,694) over the same period, a 2,115% increase.

Researchers chose to highlight 2015 and 2023 in their analysis because 2015 marked the beginning of the epidemic's fourth wave, when fentanyl-stimulant deaths among older adults were at their lowest, and 2023 represented the most recent year of CDC data available.

The researchers noted that the rise in fentanyl deaths involving stimulants in older adults began to sharply rise in 2020, while deaths linked to other substances stayed the same or declined. Cocaine and methamphetamines were the most common stimulants paired with fentanyl among the older adults studied, surpassing alcohol, heroin, and benzodiazepines such as Xanax and Valium.

""National data have shown rising fentanyl-stimulant use among all adults,"" said Mr. Pasia. ""Because our analysis was a national, cross-sectional study, we were only able to describe patterns over time -- not determine the underlying reasons why they are occurring. However, the findings underscore that fentanyl overdoses in older adults are often multi-substance deaths -- not due to fentanyl alone -- and the importance of sharing drug misuse prevention strategies to older patients.""

The authors noted anesthesiologists and other pain medicine specialists should:

""Older adults who are prescribed opioids, or their caregivers, should ask their clinicians about overdose prevention strategies, such as having naloxone available and knowing the signs of an overdose,"" said Richard Wang, M.D., an anesthesiology resident at Rush University Medical Center, Chicago and co-author of the study. ""With these trends in mind, it is more important than ever to minimize opioid use in this vulnerable group and use other pain control methods when appropriate. Proper patient education and regularly reviewing medication lists could help to flatten this terrible trend.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Your type of depression could shape your body's future health","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251012054604.htm","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 01:12:23 GMT","

Scientists have long known that depression increases the risk of developing metabolic disorders. Now, new research reveals that specific forms of depression are tied to different cardiometabolic diseases. The findings were presented at the ECNP Congress in Amsterdam.

Over a seven-year period, researchers followed 5,794 adults who participated in the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity (NEO) Study. None of the participants had diabetes or cardiovascular disease when the study began. Each person completed a detailed questionnaire assessing depressive symptoms. Based on these responses, the researchers identified two main types of depression: one characterized by ""melancholic"" features (including early morning awakening and loss of appetite) and another defined by ""atypical/energy-related"" features (such as fatigue, increased sleep, and higher appetite).

During the study, about 8% of participants developed a cardiometabolic disorder. The specific illness that appeared, however, depended on the kind of depression they had. Individuals with ""atypical/energy-related"" depression were roughly 2.7 times more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes than those without depressive symptoms, but they did not face a higher risk of cardiovascular disease.

By contrast, participants with ""melancholic"" depression were about 1.5 times more likely to experience cardiovascular disease (including heart attack or stroke) than those without depression, but they did not have a significantly greater risk of Type 2 diabetes.

Lead researcher Dr. Yuri Milaneschi (Amsterdam UNC) explained:

""Further metabolic analysis revealed that patients with the atypical/energy-related symptoms showed disruptions in inflammatory and metabolic processes linked to cardiometabolic health. This biological signature was not seen in those with ""melancholic"" symptoms, suggesting biochemical differences in the way that different types of depression link to cardiovascular health.

We already knew that not all depressions are the same, but this means that we may need to consider how the type of depression someone has impacts different areas of their physical health. It very much pushes us towards the idea of precision psychiatry -- the idea that we need to look for physical associations with mental health profiles, so that we can better treat mental illness. To treat sufferers individually.""

Commenting, Dr. Chiara Fabbri (of the University of Bologna) said:

""The prevention and treatment of physical diseases in people with depression are not less important than the treatment of depression. These physical conditions are common and expected to raise, for example the number of people with diabetes (66 million) in the EUR Region will see a 10% increase by 2050 according to the International Diabetes Federation. It is a health care priority to prevent cardiometabolic diseases, diagnose them early, and continue to improve monitoring and treatment. This study on the NEO cohort provides highly valuable data on how to do this better for people suffering from depressive symptoms.""

Dr. Fabbri was not involved in this work; this is an independent comment.

Surging temperatures worldwide have pushed coral reef ecosystems into a state of widespread decline, marking the first time the planet has reached a climate ‘tipping point', researchers announced today.

They also say that without rapid action to curb greenhouse-gas emissions, other systems on Earth will also soon reach planetary tipping points, thresholds for profound changes that cannot be rolled back.

“We can no longer talk about tipping points as a future risk,” says Steve Smith, a social scientist at the University of Exeter, UK, and a lead author on a report released today about how close Earth is to reaching roughly 20 planetary tipping points. “This is our new reality.”

Led by Smith and other scientists at the University of Exeter, the report assesses the risk of breaching tipping points such as ice-sheet collapse, rising seas and dieback of the Amazon rainforest. It also discusses progress towards various positive tipping points focused on social and economic change, such as the adoption of clean energy.

The group's first such assessment, released less than two years ago, raised alarms but did not officially declare that any climate tipping points had been reached. In the past few years, however, global temperatures have surged, sparking concerns among some scientists that global warming is accelerating and could lead to even more widespread impacts in the coming decades than the changes that have already been recorded.

Australia's Great Barrier Reef is ‘transforming' because of repeated coral bleaching

Australia's Great Barrier Reef is ‘transforming' because of repeated coral bleaching

The impact on coral reefs has been particularly severe in the past two years , pushing these ecosystems to their tipping point, the researchers say. The warming waters have caused corals across the globe to bleach, a process that occurs when the organisms expel the symbiotic algae that provide them with nutrients, oxygen and vibrant colours. The fourth global bleaching event in the past few decades began in January 2023, and researchers estimate that it has affected more than 84% of the planet's coral ecosystems.

The initial tipping-point report talked about large-scale threats to corals in the future tense, but the latest global bleaching event has made it clear that the crisis is now, says Michael Studivan, a coral ecologist at the University of Miami in Florida.

Alchemy: An Illustrated History of Elixirs, Experiments, and the Birth of Modern Science Philip Ball Yale Univ. Press (2025)

When physicist Ernest Rutherford and chemist Frederick Soddy discovered nuclear transmutation — the natural decay of one radioactive element into another — in 1901, Rutherford's first cry was of alarm, not delight. “For Mike's sake, Soddy,” he chastised his co-worker. “Don't call it transmutation, they'll have our heads off as alchemists!”

Elixirs for times of plague and bullion shortage

Elixirs for times of plague and bullion shortage

Alchemy's reputation hasn't improved much since — it remains one of the most misunderstood aspects of science history. For most people, alchemy conjures up images of complex charts and mythical ingredients such as the philosopher's stone, which could turn lead into gold or create the elixir of life.

In his latest book, Alchemy, science writer Philip Ball portrays the practice instead as “one of the most versatile, allusive, and fertile products of the human imagination”. He deftly recounts its 4,000 years of history — starting with the skilled artisans of Ancient Egypt and the immortality-seeking medical practitioners of China's Western Han dynasty (202 bc–ad 9), although the practice originated before this period — picking out changing beliefs, famous works and personalities along the way.

Ball's eclectic knowledge of chemistry, his insatiable curiosity and his willingness to venture off well-beaten paths make him an excellent guide. To his credit, the book steadfastly refuses to align itself with aspects of alchemy that are overly practical (apparatus and temperature-control methods) or esoteric, and it doesn't espouse outdated ideas. Historians of science don't give much credence to the views of psychiatrist Carl Jung, for example, who professed that alchemical symbolism was a reflection of psychological desires. New Age thinking that alchemy is about spiritual transformation rather than scientific effort is less interesting than what alchemy really is.

Indeed, alchemy meant many things to different groups and schools of thought, and its story was one of chemical progress and faith-based mystery. Ball picks out several pivotal characters to show how their disparate goals, views and personalities acted as a prism for how they saw the ‘noble art'. Famous practitioners are featured, such as physicist Isaac Newton, and several individuals who are often overlooked in science history.

For example, in fifteenth-century England, alchemist George Ripley wrote his recipes in rhyming verse. In seventeenth-century Stockholm, queen Christina of Sweden — who ran her own experiments and worked with other alchemists — was a wonderfully controversial figure. She refused to marry, converted from Protestantism to Catholicism and abdicated the throne. Alchemy became the boon or bane of monarchs, depending on whether they thought it could bring them riches or were terrified that their control over their people would slip. And it was a playground for tricksters willing to take someone's money with the promise of gold that would never come.

As well as the standard Western progress of alchemy from Egypt to Europe, and from the Islamic world to Christianity, Ball's gaze also sweeps east towards traditions in China. He takes in such luminaries as the physician Ge Hong, an alchemist and philosopher, whose fourth-century recipe inspired Youyou Tu's Nobel-prizewinning discovery of artemisinin compounds to treat malaria.

Bringing us into a colourful, lively world of art, poetry and prose, Ball also steps into alchemy's offshoots. Iatrochemistry — the idea in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries that chemical substances from metals, plants and animals could treat ailments — later gave way to medicine. And Ball discusses alchemy's influence on the English language. In his 1755 English dictionary, Samuel Johnson attributed the origin of the word gibberish to the coded writings of the Islamic alchemical corpus attributed to Jābir ibn Ḥayyān (also known as Geber in a Latinized version of his name).

The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria presents a critical threat to global health. These multidrug-resistant bacteria are often protected by complex cell envelopes that many antibiotics cannot penetrate, creating an important barrier to treatment. In response, targeting bacterial envelopes has long been recognized as an effective strategy, offering potential to bypass the challenges of drug entry and efflux resistance mechanisms. Moreover, many unique bacterial envelope sites remain clinically untapped, and new compounds directed at them have the potential to diversify the space of antimicrobial mechanisms, lowering the risk for cross-resistance. Compounds that target non-proteinaceous envelope components, such as lipopolysaccharide or prenylated peptidoglycan-precursors, are particularly attractive owing to their reduced susceptibility to antimicrobial resistance development. In this Review, we explore both recently discovered compounds and established envelope-targeting antibiotics, including compounds that target Gram-positive bacteria, more complex Gram-negative bacteria and mycobacterial pathogens, shedding light on this still clinically underexplored and vital therapeutic approach.

Understanding how light modifies long-range order in quantum materials is key to improving our ability to control functionality. However, this is challenging if the response is heterogeneous. Here we address the most common form of light-induced heterogeneity—surface melting—and measure the dynamics of orbital order in the layered manganite La0.5Sr1.5MnO4. We isolate the surface dynamics from the bulk by measuring the orbital truncation rod and orbital Bragg peak. After photoexcitation, the orbital Bragg peak shows an unusual narrowing, which suggests an increase in correlation length of the probed volume. By contrast, the correlation length at the surface decreases. These differences can be reconciled if the material is heterogeneous, and light melts a less ordered surface. By isolating the surface response, we determine that the loss of long-range order is an incoherent process, which is probably accompanied by the formation of local polarons.

Normalized dynamics of the amplitude and width of the orbital Bragg peak.

a. The measured surface truncation rod at L = 0.2 in the laser blocked state. The range 1.5-12 mJ/cm2 show no significant change in intensity, indicating the sample fully recovers between pulses, with the small fluctuations due to FEL intensity and pointing fluctuations. However, for 16 mJ/cm2 a significant reduction in peak height is seen which is not related to FEL fluctuations. b laser on channel (8.7 ps after excitation), the absolute pump induced effect at 16 mJ/cm2 is not significantly lower than at 12 mJ/cm2. Likely long range orbital order has been fully suppressed and only local distortions, which can persist above Tc are present. Note the OBP showed no noticeable effect at this fluence, indicating that the changes are occurring only at the surface.

a Shows the extracted change in order parameter from the change in amplitude of the orbital truncation rod. b plots the rod area parameter, A′, which is proportional to the integrated area of the Lorentzian fitted to the transient data. c–h Fit parameters for the order parameter and phonon model. The parameters are defined in equation 1.

The dynamics of the peak (blue) and width (green) of the Lorentzian profile with (bottom row) and without (top row) subtraction of the spectator phonon mode.

a/c show the fluence dependence of Fig. 4c at L = 0.2 (a – blue cut at H ~ 0.25, b – green cut at H ~ 0.15). b/d shows the fluence dependence of Fig. 4d at (b – greet cut at K = 2, d – blue cut at K = 2.15).

Supplementary discussion on the spectator modes and dynamics of in-plane correlation length.

Subtle changes in gene expression direct cells to distinct cellular states. Identifying and controlling dose-dependent transgenes require tools for precisely titrating expression. Here, we develop a highly modular, extensible framework called DIAL for building editable promoters that allow for fine-scale, heritable changes in transgene expression. Using DIAL, we increase expression by recombinase-mediated excision of spacers between the binding sites of a synthetic zinc finger transcription factor and the core promoter. By nesting varying numbers and lengths of spacers, DIAL generates a tunable range of unimodal setpoints from a single promoter. Through small-molecule control of transcription factors and recombinases, DIAL supports temporally defined, user-guided control of transgene expression that is extensible to additional transcription factors. Lentiviral delivery of DIAL generates multiple setpoints in primary cells and induced pluripotent stem cells. As promoter editing generates stable states, DIAL setpoints are heritable, facilitating mapping of transgene levels to phenotype and fate in direct conversion to induced motor neurons. The DIAL framework opens opportunities for tailoring transgene expression and improving the predictability and performance of gene circuits across diverse applications.

Metals are at the heart of the global economy, from power generation and storage to transport. But their supply chains face three interlinked challenges: dwindling reserves, rising demand and high greenhouse-gas emissions1–3.

At the current rates of extraction and use, the known reserves of some metals, including copper, nickel and chromium, will only last for the next few decades1,2. And these rates do not take into account rising demand as the world's population grows and new technologies emerge3 (see ‘Three-part problem').

Furthermore, the mining and extraction of most metals, as well as their melting, refining, alloying, casting and shaping, are a large source of greenhouse gases. Steelmaking alone accounts for about 8% of global carbon dioxide emissions, or 3.6 billion tonnes3 — more than three times what the aviation sector contributes.

There are currently no concrete, commonly accepted long-term solutions or implementation plans. Here, based on our expertise in materials science and engineering, we outline a set of five strategies that, together, can address the challenges. The solutions that societies choose will have wide-reaching consequences for our ways of life, economy and the well-being of our planet and future generations.

Sources: Reserves: ref. 1; In demand: ref. 2; Emissions: World Steel in Figures 2024 and Sustainability Indicators 2024 reports (World Steel Association)

A small tweak in a material's chemical composition can go a long way in reducing the amount of metals used. Take steel, for example. About one billion tonnes of carbon–manganese steel are used each year globally for buildings and other infrastructure. However, using another type of steel — which has almost the same amounts of carbon, manganese and silicon, but also contains tiny amounts of niobium (about 0.03% in weight) — increases the material's strength and toughness4. Niobium-microalloyed steel is slightly more expensive than conventional steel. But because it is stronger, less material is required4,5, lowering the total cost of a building. Reducing steel consumption can also reduce CO2 emissions4,5 by some 20%.

Researchers are investigating other substitutions, too. For example, rare-earth magnets, which require elements such as dysprosium or terbium, could be replaced with less environmentally damaging ones based on iron nitride6. And sodium-ion batteries7 could replace lithium-ion ones to circumvent lithium's global supply limitations, high extraction costs and the environmental damage it causes during extraction. Scientists are also studying thermal batteries that store energy as heat rather than as electricity and that are made from materials such as cement and crushed rock.

To accelerate the adoption of materials with lower carbon footprints, governments should update policies and regulations. Governments and industry can also create certification schemes that reward low-emission material choices, helping designers, engineers and consumers to make informed decisions. And universities should include substitution principles in engineering and materials education, to train a workforce to select materials that have a minimal environmental impact, not just high performance.

Academia and industry must work together closely, through industry-funded fellowships, joint research programmes and institutions such as the US Engineering Research Centers, which are supported by the National Science Foundation.

The metal-production industry urgently needs to reduce its environmental impact. Aluminium production, for example, is responsible for around 270 million tonnes of CO2 a year (one-tenth that of steel). It also releases toxic fluorine-containing species, which are powerful greenhouse gases. And copper smelting releases large amounts of sulfur dioxide, contributing to acid rain.

Green manufacturing technologies that lower emissions are needed. Many exist already. For instance, a top gas recycling blast furnace that reuses carbon dioxide from the ironmaking process can reduce emissions substantially8. Other harmful by-products can also be upcycled. In copper smelting, for example, sulfur dioxide can be converted into usable compounds, such as sulfuric acid.

Battery prices are falling, so why are electric cars still so expensive?

Battery prices are falling, so why are electric cars still so expensive?

Innovations in hydrometallurgy and bioleaching9 that use microorganisms to break down the minerals in ores and release pure metals are revolutionizing extraction. They can take nickel, copper and gold from ores with low concentrations of these elements and avoid energy-intensive smelting procedures, enabling metal extraction from sources that were previously too expensive to mine or dismissed as unusable, such as by-products of mining and other industrial processes and electronic waste.

However, in practice, many of these advanced technologies are not being adopted because of their cost. Governments must help businesses and individuals through policies or incentives, such as low-interest loans, investment grants and carbon pricing mechanisms. Solar energy promotion shows how government incentives can accelerate adoption despite high upfront costs. The US Investment Tax Credit and state-level programmes can offer subsidies, zero-interest loans and community solar-energy support.

Another way to lower metal consumption is to improve the durability, repairability and recyclability of metal-containing products. Companies should design long-lasting products and offer end-of-life recycling. Several corporations, including technology giants Apple and Dell, have adopted circular practices through certified refurbishment programmes.

Six roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them

Six roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them

Governments must support these efforts by overseeing recycling data, enforcing disclosure requirements and setting up recycling and waste-management incentives10. The European Union has embraced this approach. For example, its Circular Economy Action Plan and its Ecodesign directive mandate standards for the durability and repairability of products. International organizations should standardize practices and environmental agencies or independent bodies must monitor compliance and progress. The International Organization for Standardization has issued standards on ecodesign and design for disassembly. The United Nations Environment Programme's International Resource Panel and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development provide guidance for sustainable material flows11.

Accelerating metal recycling must also be a top priority. Steel, aluminium and copper are already recycled widely, but urgent improvements are needed for others, such as nickel, cobalt, manganese and rare-earth elements. Advanced sorting methods and urban mining programmes12 that can recover valuable metals from electronic waste are crucial.

In 2021, for example, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry outlined the country's transition to a circular economy. According to the nation's economic and environmental ministries, some 15 million home appliances were collected nationwide in the 2021 fiscal year.

Manufacturing processes can be improved, too. 3D printing, for example, reduces waste by building objects layer by layer, using only the necessary amount of raw metal powder13.

In case you haven't heard, it's time to say goodbye to Windows 10. As of October 14, 2025, it's no longer a secure operating system to keep using, as Microsoft will not issue further updates. That doesn't mean you won't be able to use it anymore, but like it or not, you'll need to upgrade eventually.

If you have a Windows PC from the past five years or so, you can probably upgrade to Windows 11 without new hardware. But for anyone coming from an older PC, this might be a good opportunity to buy a new laptop. Below you'll find my favorite Windows laptops, all of which come with Windows 11 preinstalled.

For more laptop recommendations, check out our Best 2-in-1 Laptops, Best Gaming Laptops, and Best Budget Laptops. Meanwhile, our overall Best Laptops guide includes the best Chromebooks and best MacBooks, too. Still unsure? Read our guide on How to Choose the Right Laptop.

If it's been a while since you've shopped around for a Windows laptop, the Surface Laptop 7th Edition (7/10, WIRED Recommends) might be the biggest surprise to you. It runs on a Qualcomm-powered ARM processor, making it every bit as efficient and long-lasting as a MacBook. It also comes with a gorgeous, 3:2 aspect ratio screen with stylish rounded corners. It's really the battery life here, though, that will feel legitimately surprising if you're coming from an old Windows laptop or a desktop.

I waited a long time for a Windows machine like this Surface Laptop, which came out in 2024—something that could truly compete with the MacBook Air. And it does. The Snapdragon X2 Elite chip was just announced, but we likely won't see an update to the Surface Laptop for another five or six months, making this a solid purchase. One caveat: You might come across the Surface Laptop 13, which came out in 2025, and is cheaper. I haven't tested that one yet myself, but it does lack some of the features I like in the 7th Edition, such as the 3:2 screen.

If it's been a while since you've paid attention to advances in the Windows laptop ecosystem, the Dell 14 Plus (6/10, WIRED Review) will probably come as a shocker. Despite regularly costing somewhere between $750 and $1,000, depending on the discount, the Dell 14 Plus comes with an astounding 32 GB of RAM and a terabyte of storage. In the past, you would have paid handsomely for those kinds of specs. Even compared to the competition today, the Dell 14 Plus stands out for its value.

It's especially impressive if you factor in the high-resolution screen and 90-Hz refresh rate. While it's not my favorite laptop screen in the world due to the heavy-handed matte finish, the screen is certainly fast, sharp, and colorful. Just pay attention to the price, knowing that it's frequently been discounted to at least $650 (make sure you double-check the specs before you buy).

The Asus Zenbook A14 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is stellar. It's over a full pound lighter than most of the other laptops on this list, and is even a half-pound lighter than the MacBook Air. It really does feel incredibly light in your hands, which makes it an ideal laptop for students or anyone taking their work on the go. That extra pound is noticeable if you're carrying it around in your bag all day. On top of that, it gets you great battery life, thanks to the Snapdragon X Plus, as well as a solid OLED display.

Similar to the Dell 14 Plus, you may be impressed by just how much laptop you get for just $600 or $700. No, the Asus Vivobook 14 (6/10, WIRED Review) doesn't have premium components or a high-end design, but it still delivers. In particular, I'm talking about battery life. Thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon X inside, the Vivobook 14 gets great battery life, especially when compared to laptops at this price in the past. I have even seen the price drop as low as $550 during the Amazon Big Deal Days. That's a killer price on this budget laptop.

While the MacBook Pro continues to rule the roost when it comes to laptops for content creators, there are some solid options on the Windows side of things, my favorite of which is the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16 (7/10, WIRED Recommends). With graphics options up to an RTX 5070 and the Core Ultra 285H onboard, the Yoga Pro 9i 16 was impressively powerful in my testing. The OLED display on my review unit was glorious, but there's an even sharper and brighter tandem OLED option available, too. It doesn't have near the battery life of the MacBook Pro. But if you're a designer, video editor, or user of any heavy GPU-based application, the Yoga Pro 9i 16 is a great Windows laptop for you.

Razer

Perhaps more than any other company, Razer has been refining the idea of the ultimate gaming laptop ever since its founding. The Razer Blade 16 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) certainly feels like a crown jewel in its lineup. It's thinner than ever, wholeheartedly embraces OLED, and features the best graphics options possible, up to and including the Nvidia RTX 5090. Despite my lack of enthusiasm for Multi-Frame Generation, the primary feature of Nvidia's RTX 50-series GPUs, I was quite impressed by the game performance of this compact gaming laptop. As you might guess, however, the Razer Blade 16 is incredibly expensive. Fortunately, you can currently buy the starting configuration for $500 off, bringing the price down to $1,800, which comes with one terabyte of storage and an RTX 5060.

Windows laptops haven't always been known for being lookers. The Asus Zenbook S 16 undoes that stereotype. This thing is absolutely gorgeous—and not in a way that tries to specifically mimic the MacBook. It has its own aesthetic going with its white ""ceraluminum"" material, and I love it. It's also remarkably thin, has an expansive touchpad, and a sharp OLED display. It's the complete package. It's the only Windows laptop that actually surpasses the MacBook Air in terms of thickness.

The only problem is that the Zenbook S 16 is quite expensive, and prices haven't dropped like I hoped they would. It's an impressive configuration, though, sporting 24 GB of RAM and a terabyte of storage. On top of that, it's one of the longest-lasting Windows laptops in terms of battery life. For a smaller model, check out the Zenbook S 14, which is very similar, except it uses an Intel chip instead.

One of the strengths of the Windows platform is support for touchscreens, and the Yoga 9i is the best of the bunch. It's a true 2-in-1 laptop that has a 360-degree hinge that lets you rotate the screen all the way around. It's probably too big to use much as an actual tablet, but it's handy to be able to flip the screen around when sharing your screen or watching movies. Performance and battery life check out, and the high-resolution OLED display looks fantastic.

Framework

Framework

There's no laptop out there quite like the Framework Laptop 13 (8/10, WIRED Recommends). For the uninitiated, Framework has created a fully accessible and self-upgradeable system for its computers, much of which is completely tool-less. It's seriously impressive. If you're coming from an old desktop PC and like the upgradeable nature of your tower, the Framework Laptop can fill that void. You'll need to opt for the Framework Laptop 16 if you want better graphics for gaming, but either way, you're getting a unique device that could stay with you for the long haul.

One of the best parts of Windows is its flexibility. I love that it can work just as well for PC gamers as it does on a detachable 2-in-1 like the Surface Pro. The Microsoft laptop (6/10, WIRED Review) has never been so good, either. With the Snapdragon X Plus or Elite inside, battery life and performance are both great, important for a device that needs to be both a portable tablet and a full PC. There's even a brilliant OLED option, which greatly enhances the image quality of the screen. A smaller version came out earlier this year, the Surface Pro 12 (6/10, WIRED Review), and it's more affordable. Either way, though, you'll need to buy an appropriate Type Cover Keyboard to unlock the full capabilities of the Surface Pro.

Windows 11 vs. Windows 10: What Are the Differences?

There's a lot that can be said about the difference between Windows 11 and Windows 10. It breaks down into three major categories though.

Interface: The Start Menu is now centered in the Taskbar and looks a bit different. Visually it's quite different, but it still functions the same, offering you quick access to applications and documents. Beyond the Start Menu, just about every app will have a different visual flair, with rounded corners and a streamlined aesthetic. While you can still do you could do in Windows 10, expect things like Settings, Notifications, and System Tray to all feel different. You'll even find a new Widgets tray that can be activated over on the left side of the Taskbar. Unfortunately, the Taskbar can no longer be moved to different side of the screen.

Hardware requirements: This is where most of the frustration around Windows 11 stems from. No one likes being forced to buy new hardware, and while requirements like having at least 4 GB of RAM or 64 GB of storage seem straightforward, the need for a security chip called TPM 2.0 has forced a lot of Windows 10 users to have to upgrade otherwise-good motherboards and CPUs just to move to an operating system they didn't want to begin with.

Performance features: There are tons of new features in Windows 11 that help Windows play nicer with accessories and third-party software. One of my favorite examples is HDR support. Windows 11 finally fixes the HDR problem that made using a proper HDR monitor so troublesome, especially in games using Auto HDR. Speaking of games, Windows 11 has features like Game Mode, DirectStorage, and optimizations for windowed games, all of which make for a faster, smoother PC gaming experience.

What to Look for in a Windows Laptop

You'll want to read our extensive guide on How to Choose the Right Laptop, but for the basics, you'll want to decide what category of laptop you need. Most people should buy a 13-inch or 14-inch laptop, and spending around $750-$1,000 is a good place to start. You should expect a laptop around this price to get good battery life, have a decent screen, perform well enough for basic tasks, and have a comfortable keyboard and touchpad. You should also expect at least 16 GB of RAM and 512 GB of storage. Anything more than that gets into premium territory where you're paying for higher specs, more performance, or extra features. If you want something with a discrete GPU for either gaming or creative workflows, you'll need to spend more than this.

A laptop like the Dell 14 Plus is the ideal example of what you can get while shopping in this price range. You can even find laptops with OLED panels, up to one terabyte of storage, depending on how good discounts happen to be. I would consider anything under $750 to be a cheap laptop, and will therefore come with some significant compromises, especially around the quality of the panel and the touchpad. Fortunately, laptops that use the  Qualcomm Snapdragon X chip get great battery life, despite often falling under $750 in price.

Here's a list of important specs to consider:

CPU: For thin and light laptops, I would recommend one of the Snapdragon X, X Plus, or X Elite chips. They get the best battery life and performance for their class of laptop. As an alternative, the Intel Core Ultra 7 258V is also quite good.

GPU: As of now, the Intel's Lunar Lake chips, such as the Core Ultra 7 258V, have the best integrated graphics. For discrete options, you'll want to pick something with one of the latest Nvidia RTX 50-series GPUs, such as the RTX 5060. The biggest leap in performance there is between the RTX 5070 and the RTX 5070 Ti, which increases VRAM to 12 GB.

RAM (or memory): Stick with at least 16 GB if you can. Since the advent of the Copilot+ designation, it ha become the new standard. You'll even find laptops as cheap as $600 that have 16 GB of memory. Gamers and content creators should upgrade to 32 GB if possible.

Storage: Similar to memory, many laptops have moved to 512 GB as the new standard, and you'll find lots of affordable laptops with 512 GB as the base configuration. Upgrading to one or two terabytes, where possible, will make your life that much easier, especially since many laptops don't offer expandable storage.

Display: Laptops are usually categorized by screen size, with 13-inch, 14-inch, and 16-inch being the most common. You'll want to consider size, resolution, refresh rate, and panel type here.

Portability: Outside of display size, thickness of the chassis and weight are the primary factors here, determining how portable a laptop is to travel with. Other dimensions are important too, but more often than not, that is determined by the screen size.

Ports: Many laptops are limited to just USB-C and headphone jack these days, with some exceptions where USB-A or HDMI are included. Make sure your laptop has what you need, or else you'll need a USB Hub or laptop docking station to get more ports or to increase external display support.

Asus ROG Flow Z13

Asus ROG Flow Z13 for $2,170: One of the most unique Windows devices ever made, this gaming 2-in-1 will impress you with just how powerful it is, despite its form factor.

Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition for $1,300: I really like this uniquely-sized 15.3-inch laptop, though I have avoided recommending it very often due to its price. But when it drops under $1,000, it's a really solid deal, especially since it comes with a terabyte of storage.

Framework Laptop 12

Framework Laptop 12 for $549: This adorable little laptop is the perfect option for students and tinkerers, offering tons of upgradability in a small, affordable package.

Lenovo IdeaPad 5i 16 2-in-1 for $698: You won't find many 16-inch laptops at this price, which is what makes this worthy of mention. I wish the battery life and display were stronger, but for the price, it's a solid option.

Asus Vivobook Pro 15 for $1,500: Content creation-focused laptops tend to be really expensive, which is why I'm glad the Vivobook Pro 15 exists. It has solid specs, an OLED panel, and an RTX 4050 GPU inside to speed up creative applications and workflows.

Acer Swift 16 AI for $800: This is one of those laptops that has dramatically increased in value with its recent price drop. It's not the most attractive or trim laptop in the world, but the solid battery life, high display quality, and a terabyte of storage balance it out.

Car door handles seem innocuous. Tesla's electronic, retractable ones—since imitated by plenty of global automakers—have become a symbol of the automaker's willingness to work from design-first principles, reimagining what the car of the future might look like, electric-style.

But in September, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched an investigation into the Tesla 2021 Model Y's door handles. More than 140 consumers have complained to the NHTSA about the door handles, according to a Bloomberg report published last month.

Drivers alleged the handles have gotten stuck or malfunctioned, especially when cars' low-voltage batteries failed. Government filings highlight parents' reports that their children were trapped inside their vehicles, unable to find or activate rear-door mechanical releases, after their adults exited the car. At least four alleged the need to “break a window to regain entry into the vehicle,” according to the agency. Tesla has since promised to redesign the handles.

On Friday, the family members of two California teenagers who died after the Cybertruck they were riding in caught fire in a crash sued the automaker, alleging that Tesla knew about the difficulties of manually opening its doors before the teenagers were trapped inside.

Now new Chinese regulations would force the door handle issue in the world's biggest automotive market—rules that, given the size and power of China's auto market, could soon show up in other parts of the world.

The proposed rules, posted by China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology last month and set to be finalized after a comment period in late November, would require mechanical release handles on the inside and outside of every car, which would have to be operable without tools after accidents. The rules also appear to nix flush door handles by requiring automakers to build the handles with enough room for a hand to grip behind them.

If the rules are finalized as written, they'll kick in as early as mid-2027—a date that's around the corner for many global automakers, given their multiyear vehicle design and development process.

Making door handle changes quickly could prove a pricey and complicated challenge. How pricey and complicated comes down to each automaker's design. “There's a real-estate problem in the door space,” says Amy Broglin-Peterson, who teaches supply chain management at Michigan State University's Broad College of Business and consults in the automotive industry. Between the electronics, insulation, wiring for other parts, speakers, and other parts sandwiched into doors: “Any time you have design changes, that messes up other things,” she says.

The issues could cascade beyond the design. The auto manufacturing industry operates on strict production schedules. Though it builds in time to validate and test whatever new features come in each new model, the sudden intro of a design change late in the process could throw off the delicate timetable.

In this decade, China's auto industry has shocked the world by racing ahead of legacy automakers, quickly developing, with government support, ever newer, cheaper, and more technologically advanced vehicles on shorter production schedules. The country is the world's largest automotive market; it's expected to manufacture a full third of the world's cars by 2030. Still, quickly complying with new design regulations won't be easy for domestic Chinese automakers either, says Broglin-Peterson. “Mechncial release requires a mechanical assembly,” she says. “It's not just, you write some code.”

Automaker's door handle trouble likely won't end in China. The new rules could lead to cascading responses from other global regulators. It's a now-familiar pattern: China, once a place with lax protections, has forged ahead of the rest of the world in setting guidelines for electric vehicle battery safety and recycling, and autonomous vehicle tech. “This is a classic example of China setting the guardrails early: protecting consumers while quietly shaping global design standards,” Bill Russo, the CEO of Automobility, a Shanghai-based advisory firm, wrote in an email.

For many years, says Raphael Zammit, the chair of the transportation design department at the College for Creative Studies in Detroit, flush electronic door handles were the stuff of futuristic concept cars. “The fact that Elon Musk and Tesla put it into production was, frankly, pretty amazing,” he says. Their rise was linked with the increasing popularity of electric vehicles; tucking door handles into the doors of cars was meant to reduce their drag coefficient, leading to increased battery efficiency. Or so the theory went: Back-of-the-envelope math suggests the tweak maybe adds a mile of range. Maybe. Either way, the handles became a “demarcation of luxury,” Zammit says.

Indeed, electronic door handles can be found on many luxury vehicles, including some made by Volkswagen, General Motors, Ford, and Mercedes-Benz. Jake Fisher, the senior director of the Consumer Reports' Auto Test Center, tested several of those vehicles' electronic handles. While all had emergency mechanical releases, as the Chinese regulations mandate, some were in places that could be difficult to find in an emergency—on the floor, in shadow, or, as in the rear seats of the 2021 Model Y under investigation by NHTSA, under a slot at the bottom of the rear door pocket. The best emergency mechanical releases, Consumer Reports found, were those that simply needed to be pulled a bit harder than usual to open, an intuitive reaction in an emergency.

It's something Tesla seems to understand. “The idea of combining the electronic one and manual one into one button makes a lot of sense,” Tesla head designer Franz von Holzhausen told Bloomberg News. Indeed, the automaker will now be redesigning the door handle, combining an internal mechanical release with its electronic one. “It really helps the muscle memory of reaching for something that's there every day, so you intuitively do the same thing” in an emergency, he said in an interview. Tesla, which disbanded its public relations team in 2020, didn't respond to WIRED's questions, including those about why Tesla didn't make the changes sooner or whether the proposed Chinese rules would require further redesigns.

As with the door handles, “we do see automakers literally reinventing the wheel for no good purpose with mechanisms and designs that are demonstrably worse,” says Consumer Reports' Fisher.

The US electric automaker Rivian is also reportedly redesigning the flush, electronic door handles on its next generation of SUVs and trucks, moving the rear manual interior release away from its current location behind an unlabeled panel. The automaker doesn't sell vehicles in China. A spokesperson declined to comment on the report and wrote in a statement that Rivian's current and future vehicles “meet or exceed all Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, including passenger egress from all doors in the event of a crash or emergency.”

But automakers have declined to say how the Chinese rules will affect their designs. General Motors is reviewing and providing technical input to China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, spokesperson Bill Grotz wrote in a statement. “Until the new regulations are finalized, we cannot comment on vehicle portfolio implications,” he wrote.

Mercedes-Benz spokesperson Yifei Wu wrote in a statement that Mercedes-Benz vehicles are designed to unlock and extend their exterior door handles when the vehicles' air bag units detect a crash. “We are watching this topic closely and will of course adapt accordingly, if this [Chinese] proposal will change anything in the requirements,” she wrote.

Ford and Volkswagen didn't respond to WIRED's requests for comment. But last month, VW CEO Thomas Schäfer told the German DW News that its customers want mechanical buttons and handles that are easy to use. “It's all nice to have these flush door handles, but they are terrible to operate,” he said. “We definitely have proper door handles on the cars, and customers appreciate it.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The ‘Womanosphere' Is Reshaping the Conservative Dating Landscape","https://www.wired.com/story/the-womanosphere-is-reshaping-the-conservative-dating-landscape/","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 09:30:00 GMT","

Anya Lacey is aware of the oxymoron that comes with being an OnlyFans creator while aspiring to be a trad wife.

When the 19-year-old Florida-based creator decided to get serious about dating this year, she ran into a wall. Either a lot of conservative men are “immediately turned off by what I do,” she says of being a sex worker, or the men she met on dating apps weren't all that serious about commitment. “It's a video game to them.”

Those experiences led Lacey to create dateanya.com, a website with two clear objectives. The first was to find Lacey a husband (users can fill out a “Date Me” application). The second—and this very much seems to be its larger aim—was for the site to serve as a kind of relationship roadmap for conservative singles serious about finding love. Billed as “America-First Dating,” the site provides suggestions for “non-negotiables” (“secure borders, secure families”) as well as dating tips for women (“let him drive the date; you drive the conversation”) and men (“exclusivity before intimacy”).

“Conservatism is really associated with men and masculine energy, and that's who was leading the industry,” Lacey says. “But now you have a lot of women coming out of the woodwork.”

Lacey is part of an expanding network of women influencers, creators, and media personalities who represent different factions of the conservative movement—spanning faith and flag moderates to MAGA fanatics—jockeying for a larger stake in the dating zeitgeist. Some are using their platform to reclaim the narrative around traditional relationships, one they say has been poisoned by feminist brainwashing and an age of endless swipes. Just as the manosphere has shaped the outlook of young conservative men through chat-casts, rallying a generation around alternative science and hypermasculinity, the rise of female-led rightwing media creators—sometimes called the “womanosphere”—are helping to shape the opinions of young conservative women everywhere.

But even as conservatives are reclaiming the debate around modern dating, coasting on the momentum of Trump 2.0, there are noticeable fractures and hypocrisies in their approaches.

On the podcast Culture Apothecary, Turning Point USA's Alex Clark educates women about optimal fertility health and well-being. In an episode of Relatable titled “Be a Godly Woman, Not Just a Trad Wife,” host Allie Beth Stuckey discusses the appropriation of the trad wife trend, saying it “can be a great thing to aspire to” but Christian motherhood is “not just an aesthetic.” More recently, in response to polycule family structures, Stuckey noted that “the sexual revolution is reaching new lows.” Much of what the women discuss—on marriage, faith, and the importance of childbearing—dovetails with the agenda of the Trump administration.

On social media, however, where Lacey has more than 1 million followers between TikTok and Instagram, she often straddles her conservatism with a wink and a smile. In one video, Lacey jokes about the consequences of not performing oral sex on your partner. In the next, she's prancing through a green meadow declaring love for “my bible,” sundresses, and conservative men.

Still, as the womanosphere grows louder, its influence is creating a less stigmatized environment for singles who no longer feel the shame of their values. “Of course that trickles down into the dating scene as well,” says right-wing influencer Debra Lea of the cultural shift, who adds that the “the popularity of monogamy, marriage, and starting a family is growing far beyond just the conservative movement.”

Though she hasn't prioritized finding a partner, Lea, 25, has dated a range of conservative men over the last few years. In the post-Biden era of young romance, she's noticed a key difference; “politics seem to be more commonly discussed both on and before dates.” The hardcore moderates always “bring out my ultraconservative side,” she says. “I would never marry or seriously date somebody unaligned with me politically, but I believe there are many more important factors to align on, such as religion, healthy lifestyle, and hobbies.”

The conservative dating revival comes as romantic relationship patterns are steadily shifting. Americans are having a record low amount of sex, according to a report by the Institute for Family Studies. Marriage is also on the decline. Meanwhile, dating app fatigue seems to be at an all-time high.

Lauren Kenzie, a 23-year-old social media manager from Fresno, California who believes it should be illegal to burn the American flag, often uses TikTok to broadcast what she wants, and doesn't want, in a partner. In one post, reciting audio from Kesha's 2010 song “Grow a Pear,” she suggests she could never date liberal men because they have “a vag.” (The song is a common choice among young single conservatives on the platform, who use it to troll men with progressive values.) “I am very straightforward on what I believe in,” Kenzie says, “and if you don't believe in what I believe then it's not gonna work out.”

Politics have always played an important role in who people date, but especially so for conservatives, who have often faced more pushback than liberals as dating apps replaced the analog meet-cute. Though right-wing apps like Patrio, Righter, and Donald Daters launched around Trump's first term, they have struggled, even now, to find wide user ship. That has forced conservatives to search for love on the major platforms, where they weren't always welcome.

On TikTok, Republicans have been mocked for hiding behind “moderate” or “not political” labels, or removing them altogether (certain apps, like Hinge and Bumble, let users add party affiliations to their bio). Left-leaning women have stressed that being a Trumpie signals immediate red flags for a potential partner. “She doesn't have to worry about if you're a misogynist, you voted for one,” one TikTok user noted, after a contestant on The Date Night Podcast was dumped for revealing just that.

But today, young conservatives seem more emboldened to speak out. In July, after attending a Turning Point USA event, health performance coach Julian Becerra uploaded a video extolling the values of traditional relationships where “the man is the head of the household and the woman isn't required to go work and climb some crazy, bullshit corporate ladder and report to a male boss. She can raise a family like how it's intended to be.” The video garnered over 1,600 comments.

Lea calls this moment a revival era where women can once again vocalize their dreams of being a stay at home mom without feeling any guilt or shame. “[It was] one of the most important jobs in the world, and since the 1960s and the rise of the feminist movement, society has looked down on stay-at-home moms,” Lea says. “There was bound to be a cultural rebound to tradition.” Despite her take on this, Lea herself is a content creator who produces multiple videos a week on everything from ICE-led deportations to why she wants to #MakeAmericaHotAgain.

Some academics suggest that the promotion of a domestic utopia during eras of draconian governance serves an essential purpose. In Mothers in the Fatherland: Women, the Family, and Nazi Politics, historian Claudia Koonz argues that in authoritarian regimes of the past, women were critical in shaping how society coped with its new reality by spoon-feeding narratives of subordination and conformity. As “men preached race hate and virulent nationalism that threatened to destroy the morality on which civilization existed, women's participation in the movement created an ersatz gloss of idealism,” Koonz wrote, adding that their role helped uphold an illusion of decency.

“I watch the Brett Cooper podcast a lot. She just had her baby. She has a beautiful husband and a beautiful home. She's a really big voice for women right now,” Lacey says of the conservative influencer who is popular among Gen Z.

“I truly believe women of all political ideologies—except woke lefties who are too far gone from reality—are suffering the effects of the loneliness epidemic and are finally beginning to understand that marriage and children was always the solution,” Lea says. Studies have confirmed, however, men experience loneliness at a marginally higher rate than women, and often have a harder time seeking out support. And women are out-earning men in several US cities, according to a Pew Research Center analysis, which may explain why they are more selective when dating. Some studies have noted that unmarried women tend to be happier.

“Men want to marry feminine, attractive, and kind women whereas women want to marry strong, masculine, and hardworking men,” Lea says. “We spent the last few decades pretending this wasn't the truth but now, with President Trump at the helm of our country and culture, the dating scene can return to what it's always been: normal.”

But even “normal” is changing for conservatives.

Lacey is hopeful her website will yield results. Until then, she intends to make her living through OnlyFans; her content is a mix of solo and partner sex scenes (when Lacey does record with other people, it's with one specific person). “Traditional is traditional, but tradition evolves. We're in a new day and age,” she says. “Back then, traditional meant you could just survive off of one income.” That's not possible anymore, she tells me, explaining that she's happy to make this sacrifice now to build a stable future for her family, a dream that includes settling down on a ranch with a husband and three kids.

“Just because you're filming videos and posting them doesn't necessarily take you out of the traditional role,” she says. “To some extent, though, all of us fall short of our beliefs.”

A recent study of Enceladus, one of Saturn's moons, has detected several organic compounds that had never been recorded there before. The findings, published this month in Nature Astronomy, provide new clues about the interior chemical composition of this icy world, as well as new hope that it could harbor life.

The researchers analyzed data from the Cassini probe, which launched in 1997 and studied Saturn and its moons for years until its destruction in 2017. For Enceladus, Cassini gathered data from ice fragments forcefully ejected from the moon's subsurface ocean up into space.

Enceladus is one of 274 bodies so far discovered in Saturn's gravitational pull. It measures about 500 kilometers in diameter, making it the planet's sixth-largest satellite. While this moon does not stand out for its size, it is notable for its cryovolcanoes—geysers at Enceladus's south pole that spew out water vapor and ice fragments. Plumes of ejected material can extend to nearly 10,000 kilometers in length, which is more than the distance from Mexico to Patagonia, and some of this material rises into space. The outermost of Saturn's main rings—its E ring—is primarily made up of ice ejected into space by Enceladus.

This material is believed to come from a saline water chamber beneath the moon's icy crust that is connected to its rocky core. It's possible that chemical reactions are taking place down there, under high pressure and heat.

Until now, most chemical analyses of ice from Enceladus were of particles deposited in Saturn's E ring. But during a high-speed flyby of the moon in 2008, Cassini was fortunate enough to directly sample freshly ejected fragments from a cryovolcano. The new research paper reanalyzed this data, confirming the presence of previously detected organic molecules, as well as revealing compounds that had previously been undetected.

“Such compounds are believed to be intermediates in the synthesis of more complex molecules, which could be potentially biologically relevant. It is important to note, however, that these molecules can be formed abiotically as well,” Nozair Khawaja, a planetary scientist at Freie Universität Berlin and lead author of the study, told Reuters. The discovery significantly expands the range of confirmed organic molecules on Enceladus.

The key is that the compounds appeared in freshly ejected particles, suggesting that they were formed within the moon's hidden ocean or in contact with its internal interfaces, not during their journey through the E ring or via exposure to the conditions of space. This reinforces the hypothesis that hydrothermal processes beneath Enceladus's surface could be generating rich organic chemistry. Combining this new research with previous studies, scientists have now found five of the six elements essential for life—carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur—in the satellite's ejected material.

This itself is not a discovery of life, nor of biosignatures—the signs of life. However, the research confirms that Enceladus has the three basic conditions for life to form: liquid water, an energy source, and essential elements and organics. “Enceladus is, and should be ranked, as the prime target to explore habitability and search whether there is life or not,” Khawaja said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","How to Make STEM Funny—and Go Viral Doing It","https://www.wired.com/story/freya-mcghee-stem-stand-up-comedian/","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 10:30:00 GMT","

Stop me if you've heard this one before. An aspiring chemist goes to college, realizes she's not good at chemistry, and bombs her dissertation. She takes a class in standup comedy and decides the best way to talk about STEM is to make jokes at its expense.

This isn't a punchline. It's Freya McGhee's life. Based in London, the comedian had a strong interest in science as a kid, but after attending the University of Brighton to study chemistry, she realized that she liked learning science more than she liked applying it. Her thesis dissertation—“Synthesis of Iron Nitroxide radical species using radical derivatized ligands and its use as a single-molecule magnet”—flopped. She evaporated her results in the lab.

“I was like ‘I don't know what to do anymore,'” McGhee says. “I feel like if someone else did it, they might get further along with it, but for me it definitely didn't work. It was a nightmare.”

As she was finishing her degree she started studying stand-up and turned that nightmare into a pretty good bit. It's gotten 4.4 million views on Instagram. McGhee's stand-up sets regularly get hundreds of thousands or millions of views—and lots of fun comments. WIRED reached McGhee at home in London to talk about what it takes to make STEM funny.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

ANGELA WATERCUTTER: Obviously you made a pretty abrupt turn from chemistry to comedy, but when you first started doing stand-up were you joking about STEM then, or did you find your way there over time?

FREYA MCGHEE: When you're newer I think it's easier to get laughs for dating jokes and stuff that's relatable. But if you're coming onstage, especially in front of a non-science crowd, trying to get them to laugh at science stuff is really hard. You have to explain the science and then tell the joke. You lose momentum.

Right. There's too much setup.

But then I realized if I did it with a PowerPoint, if I just put the science up as a PowerPoint, it was much easier for people to understand. When I figured that out it was endgame really.

Yes, your sets kind of feel like an advanced high school science course with a very funny instructor.

Yeah, it's very on-brand, isn't it? It just made logical sense to me. Like, if I put it into a visual, it cuts out the part of the joke that's losing momentum. Or I can get to the punchline quicker if I use a visual aid. But it does feel funny to be doing science jokes and holding a clicker as well. It's all part of the theme, really.

So how did you find your audience?

At the Edinburgh Fringe Festival there are some science stand-up showcases. So I started doing more of those and just experimenting. It's like being back in A-level physics with the six people in your class, except they're in this comedy room, which is quite nice.

When did you start going to the Fringe Festival?

In 2023. I did a showcase with two other comedians where we had to audition for it and it was awful. It was so bad. We were so new. Well, I was really new. I think the others were actually OK, but I was really new and I just had to do 20 minutes. I don't even think I had five, and I just died on my ass every day for a month. That's when I started doing the science gig.

I'm actually kind of glad it was really bad. If those first sets had gone well I wouldn't have been like oh, I want to do science jokes instead.

I saw the flyers for STEM comedy nights on your Instagram. That was part of the festival, right?

So the next year, me and my friend Alex—she does maths—we brought a show called Comedians in STEM. I did chemistry jokes; she did math jokes. We've since done adjacent nights in London and Brighton and I think Bristol. We get other comedians who also have STEM backgrounds and they try out jokes. So then they have a science audience that they can try out their STEM jokes on.

I feel like you've also found that science audience online. The comments on your posts can get deeply nerdy. What's the joke or bit that you've done that's gone the most viral?

There's this joke I do where I put a titration [setup] on the screen and say “Want to hear a joke about titrations?” Then I flick through and say, “Ope, you missed it” as if to say you always miss a titration. I think that must've gotten 10 million views. Even on reposts, if I repost it as a reel or something, it still goes viral now. And the comments are the most niche comments ever. It's so funny.

I definitely had to Google that joke. Do you find that you alter your jokes depending on how science-y the audience seems?

I didn't get great grades, so thankfully I'm not so smart that people won't get what I'm talking about. But also if you talk about something that's really niche in your field, then people in different fields won't get it either. It's better to keep it broad. That stuff gets the most laughs.

But it's also scary because if you do it in front of a science crowd and it's not right, you don't get heckled, you get corrected. It's really intense.

Wait, I saw this. You posted a video of someone in the crowd telling you they were a veterinarian and then you said “OK, some of this might not be right …” and then that got a laugh.

Yeah, definitely.

I normally start shows by saying I have a degree in chemistry, and then asking who else does. If there's anyone in there that has a degree in chemistry of a higher level or from a better university, I'm cooked.

What's the worst heckle you've ever gotten?

I did a work in progress show last Sunday, and I was doing a joke about exothermic reactions.

This is the joke where you ask if the audience wants to hear about exothermic reactions and then say you don't have the energy.

Yeah, and in my head, I swear it's right. But I just hear a little voice that goes, “Actually, I think if you change that to activation energy, it will work much better.”

OK, fair, but yours also works, so …

I do one joke where I draw a line of best fit. In Edinburgh, I drew it as a straight linear line of best fit and then after the laughter died someone piped up and was like, “Actually, it's an exponential curve of best fit.”

What's worse is that I've done that joke many times and it wasn't until someone said that that everyone in the audience was like “Yeah, they're right.” It's like oh no, I've done this joke 20 times …

Do you think of your sets as educational? Or at least informative?

Maybe a bit. But I'd probably put that energy to other things. Like I'm currently writing a book about the periodic table, and it's like a young adult kids' book. So it's ages 10 to 15. That is actually genuinely educational where I've divided the book into groups of the periodic table, and then each group is related to their characteristics and their properties as an element, and then I sort of fictionalized them into personalities that match those properties. So that is educational. But it could lead to me producing, hopefully, more educational content like the book.

Do you do comedy full-time now? Obviously you're writing a book, but have you been able to, ironically, leverage your chemistry degree into a career at this point?

I actually don't do comedy full-time. I have a full-time job, which I do really enjoy. I feel like it is a hard one. You could just go comedy full time, but you then find yourself doing gigs in Ipswich on a Monday night, which I can't really. I don't mean that in a bad way. But you do sort of end up having to do any gig that will get you money.

What's your day job?

I work in sales for a construction company. So I really am in those male-dominated fields.

Sheesh, yeah. Science, comedy, construction. That's a trifecta.

But I do really, really love my job. So I feel like it's a nice balance at the moment. Especially with social media, you can balance your time. I can do shows at the weekend. Sell tickets, put the show on. Sunday at 4pm? Great, I'll be in bed early. Social media is a game-changer in that way. It puts the power in your hands. You don't have to quit your job the second that you get gigs around the country.

Right. You can do shows close to home and put them online. Because of that, do you find the heckling online different, or even worse? Do you get people who get out of line in your comments? Being a funny woman on the internet isn't always smooth sailing.

You definitely still have people like that. I don't ever really let it bother me too much, really. My reasons why I do comedy, especially with the science stuff, are quite strong. I know exactly who I'm doing it for and why. So when I see comments that are really, really bad, I normally just delete them—not even for me. I wouldn't want a 15-year-old girl to be scrolling Instagram and then see a comment about a female comedian or female scientist.

So what's next for you? Obviously you're working on a book, but what's the next step in the logical progression of a STEM stand-up?

I keep doing all these work-in-progress shows to build up to a debut hour. So I'd like to get to a certain number of followers where then you can go on tour and it would actually sell tickets. Right now it feels like I have a 50-minute thing. But it's a set that has a lot of jokes and no through line. Not that it needs to have a through line. I know people get a bit artsy about this sort of stuff, but I'd quite like to actually explain why I'm doing jokes about science and bring some reason to why I'm doing this into it and actually be able to tour that show.

Right. Have a show about STEM that's also a show about why you wanted to do STEM comedy in the first place.

I'd quite like it to be a proper show for the scientists in a way. I do feel it is heavy on dating, which I do like doing jokes about, but I would like a few more science ones and a few more tiny niche ones that are just for maybe five people in the crowd.

Rollercoaster Tycoon wasn't the most fashionable computer game out there in 1999. But if you took a look beneath the pixels—the rickety rides, the crowds of hungry, thirsty, barfing people (and the janitors mopping in their wake)—deep down at the level of the code, you saw craftsmanship so obsessive that it bordered on insane. Chris Sawyer, the game's sole developer, wrote the whole thing in assembly.

Certain programming languages, like Python or Go or C++, are called “high-level” because they work sort of like human language, written in commands and idioms that might fit in at a poetry slam. Generally speaking, a piece of software like a compiler transforms this into what the machine really reads: blocks of 1s and 0s (or maybe hex) that tell actual transistors how to behave. Assembly, the lowest of the “low-level” languages, has a near one-to-one correspondence with the machine's native tongue. It's coding straight to metal. To build a complex computer game from assembly is like weaving a tapestry from shedded cat fur.

Why would anyone do this? I recently asked Sawyer, who lives in his native Scotland. He told me that efficiency was one reason. In the 1990s, the tools for high-level programming weren't all there. Compilers were terribly slow. Debuggers sucked. Sawyer could avoid them by doing his own thing in x86 assembly, the lingua franca of Intel chips.

We both knew that wasn't the real reason, though. The real reason was love. Before turning to roller coasters, Sawyer had written another game in assembly, Transport Tycoon. It puts players in charge of a city's roads, rail stations, runways, and ports. I imagined Sawyer as a model-train hobbyist—laying each stretch of track, hand-sewing artificial turf, each detail a choice and a chore. To move these carefully crafted pixels from bitmaps to display, Sawyer had to coax out the chip's full potential. “RollerCoaster Tycoon only came about because I was familiar with the limits of what was possible,” he told me.

Working within the limits? A foreign idea, perhaps, in this age of digital abundance, when calling a single function in an AI training algorithm can engage a million GPUs. With assembly, you get one thing and one thing only, and it is the thing you ask for—even, as many a coder has learned the hard way, if it is wrong. Assembly is brutal and beautiful that way. It requires you to say exactly what you mean.

I've done assembly's creators a disservice. They wanted things to be easier, not harder. I imagine they were tired of loading up punchcards and flipping switches on their steampunk leviathans. Perhaps they dreamed of a world like ours, where computers can do so much with such minimal guidance.

The first assembly language, created in the 1940s by Kathleen Booth (though she has not always gotten her due, surprise surprise), hardly resembled language. Codes stood in for codes. To tell the machine to perform an operation—say, “0,0111” in machine code—you'd instead employ a series of letters and symbols, which a new piece of software, called an assembler, would translate into binary. Soon, the commands got human-­friendlier mnemonics like “MOV.”

To know assembly was to know the CPU itself—what it could do and, even more, what it couldn't. A chip's physical design, how the circuits connecting the logic gates of AND and XOR are actually laid, defines how it works. Its functions are pretty basic, breaking down instructions into elementary steps: Fetch something from memory and put it in a temporary cubby, known as a register. Decode it there. Perform some operations, like comparing two values, or adding them. Ship it back off the memory.

As chips advanced, new dialects of assembly evolved. The code that landed the first human on the moon was assembly—designed for only one chip, the Apollo 11 Guidance Computer. If you want to read the leaked source code of the Furby, you'll need fluency in 6502. To hack your Ti-83 calculator, you'll need z80. Learning the language of one chip—say, Intel's x86—and then moving to Arm is like studying Arabic in Beirut and then trying to get by in Tunis or Khartoum. Good luck.

I learned x86 assembly in college as a refugee from math. Where my classmates seemed to enjoy the drab incantations of Java, I loved the logic game that was assembly. It was easy to fail, but to fail in ways that were explainable if you looked at the circuits and registers. How masterful I felt coding in the simple commands of this not-quite-language; how fragile I knew that mastery to be. To say, put these bytes there—no, there, at that register, in those capacitors. Remember this. Forget that. To grind away, painting each figurine, one by one.

It's true that there's no longer much point in using assembly in the day-to-day work of coding. High-level languages are so efficient that their abstraction is almost always preferable. Even assembly's inventor moved on to other ventures; one of Booth's final papers, in the 1990s, used neural networks to match seals with their barks. Sawyer switched over too. He's been dabbling in home automation recently—lights, temperature sensors, sound systems, and the like, coded on Raspberry Pis using Python, which he initially found “quite off-putting,” he told me. But even on that tiny processor, it gets the job done just fine.

Then along comes something like DeepSeek to remind you that humans can still communicate better with our hardware. Earlier this year, the Chinese company that made these incredibly efficient AI models upended the narrative that AI advancement can come only from more chips and more energy. Assembly was one surprising reason. DeepSeek's engineers reached into the subfloor of Nvidia's chips, commanding each individual machine to compress data from 32 bits to 8 bits—sacrificing precision for efficiency—at precisely the right moments. Observers were stunned. You could do that? The DeepSeek engineers had tapped an art most others had forgotten.

I was similarly taken when, in 2023, researchers at DeepMind taught a machine x86 assembly, then asked it to improve on the long-standing sort() function in C. The AI made strange, unintuitive choices, performing odd jumps between registers, and in the end cut precisely one step. A fraction of a milli­second saved, perhaps. But happening countless times a day, now that the new algorithm has been officially adopted.

To me, it was a reminder that we humans created these machines, and even as they appear to spiral into complexity beyond our comprehension, they remain under our command. We can always make them work better. It was like what Sawyer said when he recounted his recent Raspberry Pi–enabled home coding experiment. It was probably just his imagination, but the display had been a little laggy, he thought. He'd redo the code if he could, he said. But alas, Sawyer and the machine did not speak the same assembly language.

In the high-stakes, hyper-accelerated world of artificial intelligence (AI), one company has stood as the undisputed king and sole purveyor of computational picks and shovels in a digital gold rush: Nvidia.

For years, Nvidia's combination of powerful GPUs and its proprietary CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) software platform has created a nearly unbreachable moat, making it the default choice for anyone serious about training large-scale AI models. But empires that seem invincible rarely are.

Last week, the foundation of that empire was shaken. In a blockbuster announcement, AMD revealed a massive, multifaceted agreement with OpenAI, the world's most influential AI research and deployment company.

This deal isn't just another hardware order; it's a strategic realignment. AMD will supply its Instinct MI-series GPUs for OpenAI's foundational model training, and perhaps more importantly, OpenAI will gain deep access to AMD's open-source software stack.

This deal is a direct challenge to Nvidia's dominance, a validation of AMD's long-game strategy, and a clear signal that the AI infrastructure landscape is about to become a fiercely contested battlefield.

So what does this partnership mean for the balance of power in AI — and for Nvidia's once-unshakable dominance? Let's break down the strategic significance. As always, we'll close with my Product of the Week, a new embedded processor from AMD that will have broad implications for a variety of markets and machines.

To understand the significance of this moment, one must appreciate AMD's history as the perpetual, scrappy underdog.

For decades, the company has fought a two-front war against giants. In the CPU market, it was the perennial number two to Intel's seemingly unassailable dominance. In the GPU market, it has constantly battled Nvidia for a distant second place. Yet, under the leadership of CEO Lisa Su, AMD has undergone a remarkable transformation fueled by brilliant engineering and the hubris of its rivals.

AMD's comeback against Intel was driven by its revolutionary chiplet architecture in Zen-based processors. While Intel struggled with its monolithic chip designs, AMD cleverly combined smaller, high-yield chiplets into a single, powerful processor. This approach proved to be more efficient, scalable, and cost-effective, allowing AMD to leapfrog Intel in performance in both the consumer and, critically, the data center markets.

Against Nvidia, the fight has been tougher. Nvidia's CUDA platform is the very definition of a “sticky” ecosystem. It's a proprietary software layer that allows developers to harness the parallel processing power of Nvidia GPUs. With over a decade of development and a vast library of tools, it became the industry standard.

This software moat was so powerful that even if AMD produced a competitive GPU, the immense effort required for developers to switch from CUDA made it a non-starter. AMD's answer was not to build a better walled garden, but to bulldoze those walls.

AMD's counter-strategy to CUDA is ROCm (Radeon Open Compute platform), an open-source software stack. For a small developer, the benefits of CUDA's maturity are compelling. But for a massive, sophisticated player like OpenAI, a proprietary, closed system like CUDA is a gilded cage. It creates vendor lock-in, limits customization, and places your entire operational future in the hands of a single supplier.

This is where AMD's open-source approach becomes a strategic masterstroke. By providing an open platform, AMD is telling OpenAI, “Here are the keys to the kingdom. Look at the source code, modify it, optimize it for your specific workloads, and build upon it as you see fit.”

For a company operating at the absolute cutting edge of AI, this level of control and transparency is invaluable. It allows them to fine-tune the hardware and software stack for maximum efficiency, a critical factor when training models that cost tens of millions of dollars in compute time.

This AMD deal is a powerful indicator that, in the long term, the largest AI players will inevitably favor open platforms that offer flexibility and prevent them from being held hostage by a single, powerful partner. AMD's partnership with OpenAI puts immense pressure on the in-progress Nvidia-OpenAI negotiations for their next-generation infrastructure, as Nvidia must now contend with a viable and arguably more flexible alternative.

Massive success often breeds complacency, and there are whispers in Silicon Valley that Nvidia's overwhelming market dominance has made it difficult to work with. When you are the only game in town, you can dictate prices, terms, and timelines. This “Nvidia tax” has become a significant pain point for its largest customers. That dynamic creates a powerful opening for a competitor like AMD, which is hungry, flexible, and willing to collaborate as a true partner rather than just a supplier.

AMD's strategy is to be the accessible, high-performance alternative. By offering comparable (and in some cases, superior in memory capacity) hardware with a more attractive total cost of ownership (TCO) and an open software model, AMD is making a compelling case to every major cloud provider and AI company tired of writing blank checks to Nvidia.

The AMD-OpenAI deal could not come at a more critical time. The global economic landscape is fraught with uncertainty. The impact of U.S. tariffs on advanced semiconductors from China is reshaping supply chains, and fears of a recession are forcing companies to scrutinize every dollar of their capital expenditures.

In this environment, securing long-term contracts with foundational customers like OpenAI is paramount — a strategic land grab to lock down market share before the inevitable, eventual softening of the current AI hype cycle. The company that secures the largest share of the infrastructure build-out now will be the one to weather the storm and dominate the next decade.

Looking ahead, AMD's next move will likely be to replicate this strategy aggressively. Expect to see it announce deeper partnerships with other major AI labs and cloud providers, leveraging the OpenAI deal as the ultimate validation of its platform.

AMD will continue to pour resources into ROCm to close the feature gap with CUDA, making the switch for developers ever easier. AMD is no longer just competing on hardware; it's competing on philosophy. In the world of large-scale AI, the philosophy of openness is a powerful weapon.

The AMD-OpenAI partnership is far more than a simple sales announcement; it's a declaration that the AI hardware market is now a two-horse race. It validates AMD's immense progress in both its hardware and, most critically, its open-source software strategy.

By providing a compelling, high-performance alternative to Nvidia's walled garden, AMD has given the world's most important AI company a powerful new choice. This deal introduces real competition, threatens Nvidia's astronomical profit margins, and signals a fundamental shift towards a more open, collaborative, and ultimately, more innovative future for the entire field of artificial intelligence.





A precision robotic arm positions a high-performance chip, reflecting AMD's role in powering industrial automation, medical imaging, and enterprise infrastructure with its EPYC Embedded 9000 processors.

In a world captivated by consumer gadgets and flashy AI chatbots, it's easy to overlook the foundational technologies that actually make the modern world run.

This week's standout product isn't something you'll unbox at home, but its impact will be felt everywhere from the factory floor to the operating room. We're talking about AMD's new EPYC Embedded 9000 series processors — a line of silicon brains designed to power the next generation of industrial, medical, and enterprise infrastructure with staggering efficiency and a promise of long-term stability.

At their core, the EPYC Embedded 9000 chips are built on AMD's cutting-edge Zen 5 architecture, but they are tuned for a very different mission than their consumer-facing cousins. In the industrial world, the most important metric isn't just raw speed; it's performance-per-watt. These processors are engineered to deliver maximum computational power with minimal energy consumption and heat output.

That efficiency is critical for devices that operate 24/7 in rugged, often space-constrained environments — think of the controller for a robotic arm on an assembly line or the imaging computer inside an MRI machine. Less power and heat mean higher reliability, lower operating costs, and the ability to build more compact, powerful systems.

Just as important is AMD's commitment to long-term availability. Industrial customers operate on timelines that stretch for a decade or more. They cannot afford to design a multi-million-dollar piece of medical equipment around a processor that will be discontinued in two years. AMD's stable AM5 socket platform and long-lifecycle support give these customers the confidence to invest in development, knowing the core technology will be available and supported for the life of their products.

This long-term view is bolstered by the platform's incredible flexibility and future-proofing. With expansive connectivity, including Wi-Fi 6E, PCIe Gen 5, and a suite of high-speed I/O, system architects can design a platform today that is ready for the technologies of tomorrow.

That PCIe Gen 5 slot might connect to an advanced sensor in a current machine, but it's ready to handle the data firehose from a next-generation AI vision system without a redesign. This scalability allows a single, well-designed platform to serve a vast range of applications, from a simple network firewall to a complex, AI-powered diagnostic tool, simply by choosing a different SKU from the 9000 series.

That scalability highlights AMD's key competitive advantage: its partnership-driven ecosystem. AMD isn't trying to build every industrial machine itself. Instead, it provides a robust, flexible, open set of building blocks to a vast network of specialized partners.

Companies in industrial automation, medical technology, and enterprise networking can take the EPYC Embedded 9000 series and build highly customized solutions tailored to their specific markets. This collaborative model fosters innovation and allows AMD's technology to penetrate markets far more effectively than a closed, top-down approach ever could.

The applications are as vast as they are critical. In smart factories, these processors will power the machine vision systems that inspect products with superhuman speed and accuracy. In hospitals, they will process complex data from CT scanners and ultrasound machines, enabling faster and more accurate diagnoses. In data centers, they will run the next generation of high-speed storage and networking equipment that forms the backbone of our digital world.

In essence, the AMD EPYC Embedded 9000 series is the quiet enabler of the AI-powered industrial future. It's a testament to a long-term strategy focused on delivering not just performance, but efficiency, reliability, and a stable platform that partners can build on with confidence. It may not have the glamour of a new smartphone, but it's a far more fundamental piece of our technological future — and my Product of the Week.

Seattle and Toronto are squaring off on the baseball diamond this week in the American League Championship Series. But how do the two cities fare in a battle over tech bragging rights?

Both feature powerhouse tech markets. Seattle ranked No. 2 on CBRE's recent list of top North American markets for tech talent — with Toronto right behind at No. 3. Seattle also edged out Toronto in CBRE's measure of AI talent.

Seattle is anchored by longtime behemoths Microsoft and Amazon, along with other large firms headquartered in the region such as Expedia, Zillow, and T-Mobile. Toronto lays claim to companies like Rogers Communications and Thomson Reuters — but it doesn't quite match Seattle's depth of corporate tech prowess.

Several U.S. tech companies have opened Toronto satellite offices in recent years. But a quick look at GeekWire's engineering center list shows more than 100 outposts in the Seattle area, including substantial operations for Google, Meta, and Apple. WINNER: Seattle

On the startup front, Toronto has a superstar in Cohere, the fast-growing enterprise AI model company that just hit a $7 billion valuation. 

As we've reported in GeekWire, the Seattle startup scene is full of technical talent but lacks a breakout AI upstart on Cohere's level.

Toronto is also home to security startup 1Password (hit a $6.8 billion valuation in 2022); VPN company Tailscale (raised $160 million this year); and autonomous trucking startup Waabi (raised $200 million last year).

According to CB Insights, the Seattle area has 14 unicorns, while the Toronto region has 11. 

And in Startup Genome's latest global ecosystem ranking, Seattle came in at No. 15 and Toronto at No. 20.

The GeekWire 200 list has many longstanding tech companies and fast-growing startups in the Seattle area — including sales software company Highspot ($3.5 billion valuation in 2022); fusion startup Helion (backed by Sam Altman and SoftBank); and health data firm Truveta (reached unicorn status this year).

Software testing startup Statsig was ranked No. 5 on the GeekWire 200 before its recent $1.1 billion acquisition to OpenAI.

Despite lacking an AI all-star, the Emerald City gets the slight edge here. WINNER: Seattle

Seattle and Toronto have premier research universities. EduRank lists the University of Washington at No. 8 and University of Toronto at No. 12 among North American schools. Times Higher Education flips the order, with Toronto at No. 21 and UW at No. 25. 

The University of Waterloo in Toronto has its own AI Institute. The UW in Seattle boasts one of the top-ranked computer science programs in the U.S.

Outside academia, Toronto has the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence and the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. Seattle has the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. 

This one is a toss up. WINNER: Tie

Tech luminaries: Seattle's lineup features veteran household names like Bill Gates (Microsoft co-founder), Rich Barton (Zillow and Expedia co-founder), and Satya Nadella (Microsoft CEO). Toronto counters with AI heavyweights Geoffrey Hinton (Nobel laureate and “godfather of deep learning”), Raquel Urtasun (Waabi founder), and Aidan Gomez (Cohere CEO). WINNER: Toronto

Both cities have baseball stadiums with retractable roofs, though Toronto's Rogers Centre was the first in the world to debut that engineering feat. T-Mobile Park in Seattle features one of MLB's largest video display scoreboards.

                                What happens here matters everywhere.                                


by Yashovardhan Wagh on Oct 13, 2025 at 12:00 amOctober 13, 2025 at 9:04 am



I've come to realize something: clutter isn't just about stuff. It's not just the old couch in the garage, the TV collecting dust, or the boxes piling up in storage. Clutter sits heavy on our minds and in our hearts too. We estimate a whopping $590B worth of unused goods sit in our houses.

And here's the truth: America has a clutter problem. We bury it, ignore it, or ship it somewhere else. But it doesn't go away, it simply piles up, in our homes, storage sheds, businesses, and in our collective conscience.

For me, this isn't just business. It's personal. I have a 2½ year old daughter, and she's just beginning to notice the world – the trees, the colors, the tiny joys most of us overlook. I don't want her to grow up surrounded by trash or inherit an unhealthy planet. I want her generation to thrive.

That's why I started Gone.com with my co-founder, Nick Huzar (co-founder of OfferUp, the largest mobile marketplace). Gone is born in the Pacific Northwest and built for the entire nation – eventually the entire world, we're building a simple but radical idea: give reusable things a second chance. Collect them, curate them, and circulate them back into the community. Our AI-powered Recommerce Engine is being built to automatically value, match, and route items from a customer's home to its best second life – whether that's our Renton store, a reseller, or another marketplace. We're removing the logistical friction that defeats most good intentions.

Most “junk” isn't junk. One man's trash is another man's treasure, this holds for most items. When you are done with something, in most cases it still has use left in it. For example your old table could anchor a student's first apartment. It can be a sofa that helps a single mom make a home. Every item has a story before it's thrown away.



All over the country, there are people and companies doing amazing work: thrift stores, nonprofits, recyclers, local haulers, circular startups. But we're all operating in silos. Currently, recommerce is a manual, low-margin business because it lacks unified data and optimized logistics.

We've proven recommerce works – that people care, that it can be profitable and sustainable. But because we're fragmented, the movement has not achieved its true potential. We treat each other like competitors, when we should be collaborators.

This needs to change, and we can change it together. The tech industry has solved e-commerce delivery (Amazon) and ride-sharing (Uber). Now, we must solve ‘Reverse Logistics-as-a-Service'.

I'm calling on everyone in this space – from local haulers to national marketplaces to join forces and build something bigger together: a true circular economy for America.

Let's stop waiting for someone else to fix it. Let's align our efforts, share data, and build infrastructure that makes it easy for people to do the right thing with their dormant stuff.

Imagine if policymakers, cities, and communities could look to one coalition for guidance on reuse, repair, and responsible redistribution. Imagine if every family in America knew where to turn when they wanted something gone – not into a landfill, but into another life.

We don't need more waste. We need willpower. And unity.

This is where I live and die. I will do everything to keep this going, because the stakes are too high to fail and only a scalable tech solution will work.

Gone.com started in the Pacific Northwest, but our mission is national and eventually international. We're not building a company for today, we're building a future for tomorrow.

Everything deserves a second chance: things, people, communities, economies, everything.

So to everyone out there in recommerce – thrift stores, recyclers, upcyclers, policymakers, innovators: let's stop working in isolation. Let's stand together, build together, and make circularity mainstream. We are ready to lead, but not alone. This isn't about Gone.com standing above the crowd. This is about building a movement where every participant matters. Are you ready to stop competing and start connecting with the platform? Connect with us and we will work together.

Because my daughter and your kids deserve to inherit a world that's uncluttered, sustainable, conscious, and alive.

Gretchen Peri has been involved in helping governments around the world find better ways to use technology for more than two decades. For the last 14 years, she led the Global Public & Social Impact practice at Slalom Consulting. 

She is now bringing her international experience home to Washington state as the new CTO of Washington Technology Solutions (WaTech). 

WaTech was established in 2011 as Washington state's consolidated technology services agency. Pretty much wherever the state is using technology to deliver services, this agency is involved.

Peri is now working to implement an ambitious new strategic plan that she says is aimed at improving how Washington uses technology to serve residents. Peri is also the opening keynote speaker at the Bellevue Innovation Exchange Oct. 16 at Bellevue City Hall. 

GeekWire caught up with Peri to talk about how WaTech plans to use AI, cloud platforms, upgraded online services, and a cultural shift in focus to improve what it offers to state residents — and to do so at a time when state budgets are tight, and federal guidance and regulation around AI and tech is still evolving. The interview was edited for brevity and clarity.

GeekWire: What attracted you to this role? 

Peri: “I've spent the last 20 years of my career in management consulting, helping state and local governments leverage technology to better deliver on their business outcomes. At my previous firm, I led our global government education and nonprofit business. And as exciting as that was, I also found that I was making a small impact in a lot of different places. At this point in my career, I want to have a large impact in one place. That's what drew me to the state. And I'm so glad I'm here.”

GeekWire: What are your top three priorities as CTO?

Peri: “I'd say my three areas of focus are: 

From in line to online, we want to be able to deliver our services where people are, when they need it, and in whatever language they need to receive it in.”

GeekWire: The new 2025 IT strategic plan calls for the development of enterprise standards for emerging technologies, including AI, automation, and cloud platforms, to ensure security, equity, and appropriate use. How big a lift do you think that will be?

Peri: “One of the biggest lifts, I think, is actually cultural. Governments always design their services from how we operate, rather than thinking about how residents and customers actually need to receive our services. So it's that cultural shift that I think is going to be the most exciting transformation and probably the most work for us as we look to leverage emerging technologies, including AI, in the right way.

Another area where agencies are very interested in using new and emerging technologies is how we expose our enterprise knowledge base — with chatbots and other things that many jurisdictions are deploying right now. We've got very rich information but finding that information can be a challenge for our residents. So using our enterprise knowledge base to deliver the information to our residents is another area.

Computer vision is actually one of the really exciting areas, and we're seeing this as we look to do automated inspections to help keep our employees safe, or monitor the health of our natural environment. There are some really interesting AI use cases around identifying and monitoring the health of fish or different types of eelgrass in the Puget Sound and in our oceans. 

There's also conversational and translational AI. The technology has come to a point now where we are able to provide our content in hundreds of languages. And even in this area, we have groups, we have communities that speak unique languages. And so the advances in technology allow us to reach them and communicate with them much easier than it used to be.

Finally, (there is) agentic workflow. That's around automating our business operations at scale, starting with things that are straightforward and simple, like invoice matching or other types of things where we can make sure that we're validating the information, and then we can move on to the task at hand.”

GeekWire: It sounds like one of your biggest challenges might be around siloed information.

Peri: “Our problem is exactly like you said, we have silos within those departments that are managing their data. We actually have silos within law enforcement agencies, where they have their records management system and their dispatch system and their evidence management system. So bringing data together within agencies is our first challenge and then bringing data together from multiple agencies is going to be our second challenge.”

GeekWire: As you're trying to bring AI to all of this, it's more challenging if you have to send AI off to a whole bunch of different places.

Peri: “Exactly, and until we bring that data together, can we really identify and track the outcomes we're looking to generate? We can track outputs, how many people we're serving with this type of product or service, but we can't necessarily say that we're delivering a healthier population or a more resilient population. So that's the main focus of why we need to bring that data together to create a foundation upon which we can really start to measure those outcomes and move those levers.”

GeekWire: Federal guidance and regulations on AI and tech are still evolving. How do you plan to navigate uncertainty and evolution at the national level?

Peri: “I am still only one month in. (But it's about) leveraging the federal standards that have been in place for quite some time and making sure that we are providing our guidelines and regulations that match the culture of Washington and (how) we want to create a welcoming environment for everyone in this state. And that's about all I can say on the federal state discussion.”

GeekWire: Do the state's current budget challenges change what you need to do in the IT strategic plan?

Peri: “I think that in this budget constrained environment, it's even more important that we rely on our technology to be able to reach people who really need it right now and deliver services more digitally so that they can access them easier.”

GeekWire: If there's one thing you'd like Washington residents to be able to say a year from now about the services offered by WaTech, what would it be?

Peri: “I think of the quote: ‘I expect exceptional, but I'll settle for awesome'. When I look back, I want to be able to say that across the board when we get to interact with people at pivotal points in their lives, which we do as government, that we have provided exceptional customer service to them.”

                                What happens here matters everywhere.                                


by Marcelo Calbucci on Oct 13, 2025 at 8:00 amOctober 12, 2025 at 10:16 pm

There are two narratives unfolding in the press, in VC/founder circles, and in the boardroom. One is about AI automation and job displacement. The other is about layoffs, hiring freezes, and a shortage of entry-level positions. As expected, we assume these are intertwined. 

There's just one problem. The data doesn't support a correlation at this point.

A comprehensive recent analysis by Yale's Budget Lab argued the current wave of AI tech made no discernible impact on the labor market. The study showed the occupational mix change mostly matches previous tech waves. In other words, AI is another tool that follows the same technology adoption curve we know.

There are valid concerns that AI will affect roles. Some will see efficiency gains, reducing the number of required humans to achieve the same result; some will be automated, replacing workers. The timeline in the current narrative doesn't match the truth on the ground, though.

The Real Culprits

What's happening in the labor market is more nuanced (and mundane) than the AI disruption story suggests. We love to think we are living in unprecedented times. Yet, we are seeing the same patterns from corporations as we saw during the financial crisis of 2008 and the dot-com bust in 2000: layoffs, hiring freezes, cost cutting, etc.

The difference between those two crises and now is that we have multiple once-in-a-decade events happening in the last five years.

These are five explanations for what we are seeing today that are not related to AI.

Covid Correction: Companies, particularly in tech, dramatically over-hired during the “Covid boom.” Amazon doubled its workforce. Peloton expanded manufacturing capacity. Zoom was a sure bet stock to buy. The demand to improve the tech stack to enable remote workers drove major adoptions across industries, boosting demand for products from Microsoft, Google, Salesforce, and other tech vendors. Companies were hiring talent, projecting an over-optimistic growth curve. In some cases, big tech was hiring talent to prevent a competitor from hiring them!

Supply Chain Hangover: Covid not only caused manufacturing plants to shut down for months, but it also affected shipping and transportation. There were many single points of failure in our global supply-chain system. Combine that with considerably higher demand for certain products, and the result was a shortage that drove inflation up. To this day, we have not fully recovered back to historical inflation levels.

The End of Cheap Money: For over a decade, the Zero Interest Rates Policy (ZIRP) fueled aggressive growth strategies. Cheap capital meant companies prioritized growth, and investors prioritized long-term strategies over short-term profits. The abrupt end led to a fundamental shift in business strategy. It didn't help that from 2022 onward, a provision in Section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code changed how companies could classify their R&D expenses (such as the cost of a software engineer), going from being an incentive for innovation and startups to a hindrance.

Trade Uncertainty: New tariffs and threats of additional trade restrictions create business uncertainty. When companies can't predict with confidence their cost structure or market access, they delay investment and slow down hiring.

Performance Management: This is not a cynical point since CEOs have explicitly called out employee performance as a reason for cuts and hiring freezes. Meta's Mark Zuckerberg called 2023 the “Year of Efficiency” to justify layoffs at the company. If you ask people working in big tech, they will agree that teams became bloated, and some people were doing little work.

AI Adoption Reality Check

AI will upend major job roles, like other major technological advancements have done. It'll do it faster than the previous shifts, making it harder for society to adapt during the transition period. There are 175 million people in the U.S. labor force in 1,057 unique roles (using the NAICS classification). A few of these roles will go through major transformations in the coming years, a few will take a decade or more, and many will take longer or won't be impacted at all.

On one hand, you have a role such as an airplane pilot that won't go away anytime soon. To create an autonomous plane requires a technology we don't have today, and society won't feel comfortable with it anytime soon. On the other hand, you have customer support and call center operators that are already being displaced by AI. Though there were setbacks in rushing it, it's almost certain that in the next five years we'll go from a 2.5 million labor force working on these roles to a tenth.

The question isn't whether AI will eventually reshape more occupations, but rather which ones, how quickly, and to what degree. Most predictions from the last few years have not only been wrong, but they were widely wrong! Most predictions about what's coming will be similarly widely incorrect. The solution to calm this anxiety is to embrace uncertainty and adaptability.

California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a landmark bill on Monday that regulates AI companion chatbots, making it the first state in the nation to require AI chatbot operators to implement safety protocols for AI companions.

The law, SB 243, is designed to protect children and vulnerable users from some of the harms associated with AI companion chatbot use. It holds companies — from the big labs like Meta and OpenAI to more focused companion startups like Character AI and Replika — legally accountable if their chatbots fail to meet the law's standards.

SB 243 was introduced in January by state senators Steve Padilla and Josh Becker, and gained momentum after the death of teenager Adam Raine, who died by suicide after a long series of suicidal conversations with OpenAI's ChatGPT. The legislation also responds to leaked internal documents that reportedly showed Meta's chatbots were allowed to engage in “romantic” and “sensual” chats with children. More recently, a Colorado family has filed suit against role-playing startup Character AI after their 13-year-old daughter took her own life following a series of problematic and sexualized conversations with the company's chatbots.

“Emerging technology like chatbots and social media can inspire, educate, and connect — but without real guardrails, technology can also exploit, mislead, and endanger our kids,” Newsom said in a statement. “We've seen some truly horrific and tragic examples of young people harmed by unregulated tech, and we won't stand by while companies continue without necessary limits and accountability. We can continue to lead in AI and technology, but we must do it responsibly — protecting our children every step of the way. Our children's safety is not for sale.”

SB 243 will go into effect January 1, 2026, and requires companies to implement certain features such as age verification, and warnings regarding social media and companion chatbots. The law also implements stronger penalties for those who profit from illegal deepfakes, including up to $250,000 per offense. Companies must also establish protocols to address suicide and self-harm, which will be shared with the state's Department of Public Health alongside statistics on how the service provided users with crisis center prevention notifications.

Per the bill's language, platforms must also make it clear that any interactions are artificially generated, and chatbots must not represent themselves as healthcare professionals. Companies are required to offer break reminders to minors and prevent them from viewing sexually explicit images generated by the chatbot.

Some companies have already begun to implement some safeguards aimed at children. For example, OpenAI recently began rolling out parental controls, content protections, and a self-harm detection system for children using ChatGPT. Character AI has said that its chatbot includes a disclaimer that all chats are AI-generated and fictionalized. 

Senator Padilla told TechCrunch the bill was “a step in the right direction” towards putting guardrails in place on “an incredibly powerful technology.”

“We have to move quickly to not miss windows of opportunity before they disappear,” Padilla said. “I hope that other states will see the risk. I think many do. I think this is a conversation happening all over the country, and I hope people will take action. Certainly the federal government has not, and I think we have an obligation here to protect the most vulnerable people among us.”

SB 243 is the second significant AI regulation to come out of California in recent weeks. On September 29th, Governor Newsom signed SB 53 into law, establishing new transparency requirements on large AI companies. The bill mandates that large AI labs, like OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and Google DeepMind, be transparent about safety protocols. It also ensures whistleblower protections for employees at those companies.

Other states, like Illinois, Nevada, and Utah, have passed laws to restrict or fully ban the use of AI chatbots as a substitute for licensed mental health care.

TechCrunch has reached out to Character AI, Meta, OpenAI, and Replika for comment. 

This article has been updated with comment from Senator Padilla.

Salesforce announced Monday the latest version of its AI agent platform as the company looks to lure enterprises to its AI software in an increasingly crowded market.

The customer relations manager giant unveiled the new platform, branded Agentforce 360, ahead of its annual Dreamforce customer conference that kicks off October 14. This newer version of Agentforce includes new ways to instruct AI agents through text, a new platform to build and deploy agents, and new infrastructure for messaging app Slack, among others.

A notable aspect of Agentforce 360 is its new AI agent prompting tool, called Agent Script, which will be released in beta in November. Agent Script gives users the ability to program their AI agents to be more flexible and better respond to “if/then” situations. This allows AI agents to be programmed to be more predictable in less rigid situations like customer questions.

Users can tap into “reasoning” models, which claim to think before responding as opposed to responding based on patterns. Anthropic, OpenAI and Google Gemini power these “reasoning” agents.

Salesforce also announced it is releasing a new agent building tool, Agentforce Builder, which allows users to build, test and deploy AI agents from a singular spot. This tool, which will be released in beta in November, includes Agentforce Vibes, an enterprise-grade app vibe coding tool that Salesforce announced earlier this month.

The company also announced a broader integration between Agentforce and Slack. Salesforce said its core apps, including Agenforce Sales, IT and HR, among others, will surface directly in Slack starting this month and expand through the beginning of 2026.

Slack is piloting a new version of its Slackbot chatbot that is meant to be more of a personalized AI agent that learns about its user and will offer insights and suggestions.

Salesforce wants Slack to serve as an enterprise search tool in the future too and plans to launch connectors with platforms like Gmail, Outlook, and Dropbox in early 2026.

This latest update from Salesforce comes at an interesting time for the enterprise AI market. Companies continue to release AI features aimed at their enterprise customers while enterprises struggle to see a return on investment for these tools.

Last week Google announced Gemini Enterprise, a suite of tools — many of which were already available — for building enterprise-grade AI agents, that counts Figma, Klarna and Virgin Voyages as early customers, among others.

Anthropic also started to show traction for its enterprise product, Claude Enterprise. The company announced it struck a deal with consulting giant Deloitte to bring its Claude chatbot to Deloitte's 500,000 global employees — its largest enterprise deal yet. Anthropic announced a strategic partnership with IBM the next day.

Salesforce touts that Agentforce has 12,000 customers — significantly higher than any of its competitors, according to its Agentforce press release. Early pilot customers of its Agentforce 360 upgrades include Lennar, Adecco, and Pearson. 

This is all despite a recent MIT study found that 95% of enterprise AI pilots fail before they reach production as companies still struggle to justify spending money on these AI tools.

Strava, the 16-year-old fitness tracking app, is gearing up to go public, the Financial Times reports.

CEO Michael Martin told the FT that the San Francisco company plans to list “at some point,” eyeing capital for more acquisitions. The company, backed by Sequoia Capital, TCV, and Jackson Square Ventures, was last valued at $2.2 billion in May.

Strava has the wind at its back, certainly. The app's user base has exploded to 50 million monthly active users in 2025, according to Sensor Tower – nearly double its closest competitor, with downloads up 80% year-over-year.

Strava's growth coincides with a cultural shift around running, particularly as people in their teens and 20s seek more alcohol-free ways to socialize. Runners also emphasize the mental health benefits of finding support networks (and, sometimes, romance). Applications for the 2026 London Marathon jumped 31% this year to 1.1 million people.

Strava's secret sauce? Turning workouts into social currency with “kudos” and split comparisons. Sensor Tower estimates consumers spent over $180 million on its subscription tier through September – a figure Strava says significantly underestimates actual revenue. The company also earns from sponsored challenges and brand partnerships.

In the latest bid by a Silicon Valley defense firm to assert its own solution for the Army's mixed-reality ambitions, Anduril Industries on Monday unveiled “EagleEye,” a helmeted computing system that seeks to turn soldiers into AI-augmented warfighters. 

The launch is notable given that the initiative is led by Anduri's co-founder Palmer Luckey, who previously started the pioneering VR company, Oculus, which was acquired by Meta.

Anduril describes EagleEye as a modular “family of systems” built atop its Lattice software that puts command-and-control tools, sensor feeds, and AI directly into a soldier's field of vision.

The company claims the system can integrate live video feeds; features rear- and side-sensors to alert operators to threats; and can track teammates in real-time. EagleEye variations include a helmet, visor and glasses.

The launch comes as the U.S. Army looks to expand its pool of mixed-reality gear suppliers. It had been using Microsoft's Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS), a $22 billion program awarded in 2018, but after years of issues, the Army handed control of the contract to Anduril this February.

Then in September, Anduril won a $159 million award to prototype a new mixed-reality system for soldiers, part of a broader Soldier Borne Mission Command effort. Anduril said the award was “the largest effort of its kind” to outfit “every soldier with superhuman perception and decision-making capabilities.”

Earlier this year, Anduril also announced a partnership with Meta to develop extended reality (XR) devices for the military, marking an unexpected reunion between Luckey and his former employer.

“I am glad to be working with Meta once again,” Luckey said in a blog post. “My mission has long been to turn warfighters into technomancers, and the products we are building with Meta do just that.”

EagleEye has a long history: the concept first appeared in Anduril's first pitch deck draft, before investors convinced the startup's team to focus on software like Lattice. 

“Going toe-to-toe with Microsoft and Magic Leap would have been demoralizing windmill-tilting driven by magical thinking,” Luckey said in a post on X in February. “Everything is different now. The world is ready, and so is Anduril.”

Arguably that's less harmful than the thread-safety issues on Linux, but there's no perfect solution here as long as POSIX stays what it is.

- On Linux systems, any user process can inspect any other process of that same user for it's environment variables. We can argue about threat model but, especially for a developer's system, there are A LOT of processes running as the same user as the developer.- IMO, this has become an even more pronounced problem with the popularity of running non-containerized LLM agents in the same user space as the developer's primary OS user. It's a secret exfiltration exploiter's dream.- Environment variables are usually passed down to other spawned processes instead of being contained to the primary process which is often the only one that needs it.- Systemd exposes unit environment variables to all system clients through DBUS and warns against using environment variables for secrets[1].  I believe this means non-root users have access to environment variables set for root-only units/services.  I could be wrong, I haven't tested it yet.  But if this is the case, I bet that's a HUGE surprise to many system admins.I think ephemeral file sharing between a secret managing process (e.g. 1Password's op cli tool) and the process that needs the secrets (flask, terraform, etc.) is likely the only solution that keeps secrets out of files and also out of environment variables. This is how Systemd's credentials system works.  But it's far from widely supported.Any good solutions for passing secrets around that don't involve environment variables or regular plain text files?Edit: I think 1Password's op client has a good start in that each new ""session"" requires my authorization. So I can enable that tool for a cli sessions where I need some secrets but a rogue process that just tries to use the `op` binary isn't going to get to piggyback on that authorization.  I'd get a new popup.  But this is only step 1.  Step 2 is...how to share that secret with the process that needs it and we are now back to the discussion above.1: https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/syst...

memfd_secret comes to mind https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/memfd_secret.2.htmlI haven't seen much language support for it, though. On one part maybe because it's Linux only.People that write in Rust (and maybe Go, depends how easy FFI is) should give it a try.I wanted for a time to get some support for it in PHP, since wrapping a C function should be easy, but the thought of having to also modify php-fpm put a dent in that. I can't and don't want to hack on C code.In practice it'd be great if the process manager spawn children after opening a secret file descriptor, and pass those on. Not in visible memory, not in /proc/*/environ

You can't read another process's environment unless you can ptrace-read the process, and if you can ptrace-read the process you know all its secrets anyway.cmdline is a different story.

Something like:

This is a very good point I'd never realised! I'm not sure how you get around it, though, as if that program can even find a credential and decrypt a file, if it runs as the user then everything else can go find that credential as well.

The environment isn't persistent between sessions. That means you need to make the change in a way that runs on every new session (login or new terminal window).Depending on how your system is configured:.bash_profile gets run once on every login.bashrc gets run once on every non-login new session (i.e. a new terminal window)It's typical, if using these files, to do something like this:    if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
        source ~/.bashrc
    fi

in the .bash_profile file, putting most other things in .bashrc, such that you don't have to worry about the distinction.If you're not even using bash or bash-likes at all, but instead something like Zsh, fish, etc you'll need to set things the way they want to be set there.> They should add a simple env var GUI like Windows has that just works, and isn't terminal-specificThis doesn't exist in linux, because there isn't ""one place"" that all possible terminals draw from. Conceivably, it's possible to write a GUI tool that reads your .bashrc file, looks for anything that resembles a variable, parses the bash code to look for ways it is set, and then present a GUI tool that could update it in common cases, but... it's way easier to just write the change in a text editor.

An old video game just looks and feels right on a CRT in a way that it doesn't on a modern hd tv, to me at least.  That doesn't necessarily mean it looks ""better"", however you might define it.It's like listening to a record.  Records are lower quality than CDs or other digital options due to limitations of the analog technology, but they can still be a real joy to listen to on an older stereo system.  There is a certain warmth, a little bit of crackle or pop, maybe a different dynamic range and other things that make a record sometimes more enjoyable, even though the ""quality"" is technically far lower.  I think sometimes we can get lost in the technical specifications of pixel density or color range or audio bitrate and end up missing out on things that can prove the human experience.A couple other random things about CRTs: there are so many that are 4:3 or standard aspect ratio instead of the widescreen that dominates today.  Watching something 4:3 that fills the whole screen (without the black letterboxing of a widescreen) feels so good and makes me miss the aspect ratio.  On the flip side, I also want to find one of the HD CRTs that is widescreen to run some of my more modern devices through.

I can definitely appreciate the draw of the old monitors, and I wouldn't mind owning a few myself for when I get the fancy, but it feels like a very 'vinyl' sort of impulse. There are certainly attractive factors, but I think in the pursuit of those people are willing to overlook the inherent flaws. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's an interesting quirk of psychology.I think LCD/OLED is definitely an improvement, though I've never been a fan of the 'softness' in comparison to the rigidity of the glass CRT screen. It's always seemed fragile to me.

Anytime director Edgar Wright releases a new movie, it's an event. Throw in Glen Powell playing the Arnold Schwarzenegger role in a high-octane Stephen King adaptation, and, well, all bets are off. That's what graced the Empire Stage at New York Comic Con this weekend as Wright, Powell, and co-star Lee Pace showed up to talk all things The Running Man and debut a brand new trailer too—which has finally made its debut online now that the con has wrapped up.

Directed by Wright, from a script by Wright and Michael Bacall (the same duo who wrote Scott Pilgrim vs. the World), The Running Man hits theaters on November 14. Most fans know the title because of the 1987 Schwarzenegger movie, but that was based on a much more sprawling 1982 novel written under King's pseudonym Richard Bachman. This version is closer to the novel, with the titular game show not beholden to a single arena but taking place all over the world. You see lots of that in the new trailer, which you can watch below.

The best parts of this trailer, besides this movie actually existing and coming out in a month, are the Edgar Wright action touches. We've seen lots and lots of action movies, but you can just tell when it's Wright behind the camera. The way it moves, the way it's cut together—everything just has this kinetic feeling, which you can bet will permeate the entire movie.

It also helps that, in addition to Powell and Pace, Wright has assembled an incredible ensemble to bring The Running Man to life. He's got William H. Macy, Emilia Jones, Michael Cera, Daniel Ezra, Jayme Lawson, Colman Domingo, and Josh Brolin. Not too shabby.

The Running Man is running to theaters soon, on November 14, and we'll have much more in the coming weeks. Are you as excited about this one as we are?

The first thing that surprised me about Lenovo's 2025 16-inch Legion Pro 7i was the size of the box. I dig through a lot of laptops here at Gizmodo, and Lenovo's 16-inch laptop seemed like an 18-incher judging by the packaging. By its heft, it felt like it too. Then I opened it up and learned what it was.

The 16-inch Legion Pro 7i itself isn't overly large, though good luck slipping it into your backpack's laptop pouch. The overt weight was intensified by the 400W power brick used to give this beast of a laptop enough juice to play all your favorite games. I'm not about to throw the baby out with the bathwater. The brick and the laptop are inextricably linked, making a big thick device bigger and thicker.

The power brick is the size of my two fists put together. You could stick it in a wall and hold up a structure that may imminently collapse. It's heavy enough that anybody who drops it on their foot runs the risk of flattened toes, as if a Looney Tunes character dropped an anvil on their southern digits. I could go on about the weighty power brick because it's indicative of what kind of device the 16-inch Legion Pro 7i is. This gaming laptop will stay at home, where its loud fans have enough runway to blast the back wall with warm air. In exchange, it offers a truly delectable OLED display that helps set it apart from some other expensive laptops at its roughly $3,600 price (though you'll find the device going for between $2,700 and $3,000 depending on storage options) with these top-end specs.

Lenovo Legion Pro 7i (16-inch, 2025)

The Legion Pro 7i (16-inch, 2025) is not the kind of device to take with you, but if you want a stay-at-home laptop with a bright, beautiful display and performance to boot, this is a great choice.

Pros

Cons

The last Legion Pro 7i I reviewed back in 2024 was one of my favorites of the year. It had everything I wanted, and it felt comfortable to boot. In 2025, Lenovo redesigned the chassis and added even more RGB lighting facing the desk and on the rear thermal shelf. The company also inexplicably replaced the “O” key with the Legion logo, and I'm not sure I need any more branding to remind me this is a Legion device than with that pretty screen. With a new Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 mobile GPU, benchmarks prove the 16-inch Legion Pro 7i is a step above its last iteration. That's necessary, considering the gaming laptop costs a little over $300 more than its predecessor.

Is it still my everything laptop? Yes, though only for a very specific use case. Lugging this beast to and from my office was a chore. The laptop lid became a mess of scuffs and thumbprints as I manhandled it. The thought of carrying a 400W power brick with me is enough to make me wish I could live a hermetic lifestyle and never leave the house again.

Lenovo's penchant for pretty OLED displays on its gaming devices enchanted me enough with the ultra-expensive Legion Go 2. Having it here, again, makes suffering through any small pain points of a big, thick laptop worth the hassle. Organic light-emitting diode display (OLED) technology allows for deeper black levels—often described as “inky”—and excellent contrast. Like the $3,300 HP Omen Max 16's OLED display, the 16-inch Legion Pro 7i goes up to 2,560 x 1600 resolution and tops out at 240Hz refresh rate with Nvidia GSync support.

Lenovo's screen is extra glossy, which enhances the OLED's pretty features at the cost of reflections from a sunny room. The Legion Pro 7i is already not travel-friendly, and taking it outside won't offer anywhere close to a premium experience when you're struggling to see anything between the glare. In the right environment, like my room with the shades pulled down, the 16-inch Legion Pro 7i is bright enough to offer enough glow during daytime, though you need to be careful positioning the screen facing windows.

The dual 2W speakers have very clear, balanced sound thanks to dual subwoofers. There's a small hint of spatial audio as well, though you'll need to turn up the volume to get a sense of the directional sound. It's barely loud enough to eclipse the noise of the fan blowing, which seems to kick in even if the gaming laptop is plugged in. The 16-inch Legion Pro 7i can be your all-in-one suite for making your games look and sound good, as they should for this price.

Though the new 16-inch Legion Pro 7i appears very different from the 2024 version, they feel very similar once you start clacking on its keys. That's not a bad thing. The laptop's keys and their 1.5mm of travel have a nice bounce to them that makes it easy to type on. Even though the keyboard features a full numpad, there is enough separation between the keys that I never got my fingers twisted when flexing my WASD instincts.

The off-center trackpad is nothing to write home about, but since you'll likely be keeping this laptop at home, you'll end up using a mouse most of the time anyway. Though I don't hate the feel of the palm rests, I wish Lenovo paid a little more attention to the overall structure of the laptop. There's a slight keyboard flex toward the center of the device you'll feel if you start to lean your weight down during an intense match.

It's not enough to make me concerned about breaking the laptop, though, for the price I expect more. The 16-inch Legion Pro 7i weighs in at 5.67 pounds, which is less than last year's model but will still feel heavy if you hold it aloft in one hand. It's thicker than other gaming laptops with an RTX 5080 GPU from 2025, such as the Razer Blade 16, but if you plan to make this laptop your main creative suite, you won't be too disappointed considering that bright, beautiful screen. There are two USB-A ports and a headphone jack on the right-hand side, plus one more on the left alongside two USB-C and an HDMI port on the left. There's one additional electronic switch to turn the 5-megapixel webcam on and off. The only thing missing is a dedicated SD card port to help creators avoid a dongle.

The proprietary power cable port also hangs out on the left, and with my home setup, it meant wrapping the power brick down and around the back of my desk. The two USB-C ports are Thunderbolt 4, meaning they can supply up to 100W of power to the PC. That's not nearly enough to top off the PC when running games, even if that's overkill for what's necessary on a mobile RTX 5080 GPU. The 400W power brick would be more necessary for an RTX 5090 GPU variant. There are some versions of the laptop with an RTX 5090 and 64GB of RAM that I saw floating around on Amazon for the same MSRP.

The real kicker for all this is just how strong a performance I got from the 16-inch Legion Pro 7i compared to other 16-inch laptops. My review unit came with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage to go along with the Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU and RTX 5080 GPU. In multiple synthetic benchmark tests, the 16-inch Legion Pro 7i slightly outperformed other gaming laptops like the HP Omen Max 16 and Alienware 16 Area-51. In Geekbench 6 CPU tests, the laptop managed to squeak out a few hundred points more in multi-core tests compared to other laptops.

For gaming, you just need to remember this laptop may still not do everything you want it to do, even with its RTX 5080 GPU strapped in with that obtuse power brick. In a game like Cyberpunk 2077, when pushing tracing to ultra settings, you'll need DLSS on “balanced” settings to achieve 60 fps when playing at the full 2,560 x 1,600 resolution. In games like Black Myth: Wukong, where the expectation is you're using Nvidia's AI upscaling, you'll easily attain more than 76 fps with all the ray tracing options enabled.

Alan Wake 2, which tanks performance once you start enabling ray tracing options, ran at around 40 to 45 fps on the highest settings with some path tracing. That was with DLSS on “balanced settings.” Other games that can hurt performance, like Marvel's Spider-Man 2, manage to equalize around a stable 60 fps when you stop yourself from maximizing path tracing. As much as you may hope an RTX 5080 will hit the peak performance, you'll inevitably have to accept some trade-offs for a steady frame rate. With the excellent display, games look crisp and detailed in a way that few machines can match, though only in just the right conditions.

Big gaming laptops don't have good battery life. It's a fact of the necessary power used for the GPU, but when you start stacking on RGB lights, bright OLED screens, and all the other fixings, you can't expect anything more than three hours of battery life on a good day. The 16-inch Legion Pro 7i is no exception. When doing my basically daily grind, with several Chrome windows open plus Slack, I can barely make it past 2.5 hours before the PC is throwing a tantrum and won't be satisfied until I plug in its massive 400W sippy cup.

The 16-inch Legion Pro 7i is not the kind of laptop to run around town with, even if you intend to use a smaller 100W charger plugged into one of its Thunderbolt 4 ports. That may be enough for some light gaming, but you'll then have to accept you'll mar your big, beautiful laptop with whatever junk you have swimming in your bag.

After enough time with the 16-inch Legion Pro 7i, I started to admire its qualities and ignore its deficiencies. Its bright OLED screen has enough to help smooth over lingering wrinkles. If I truly wanted something more portable, I'd have to look at devices like the Razer Blade (and spend the extra premium on a Razer product, not to mention deal with their less-than-stellar support) or opt for a 14-inch gaming laptop. An 18-incher like the Asus ROG Strix Scar 18 may be better as a true desktop replacement. Still, I never felt like I was missing anything from Lenovo's all-in-one laptop, except for a baby carrier to lug this laptop and its power brick around with me.

At a conference in 2019, marine biologist and coral reef conservationist Melanie McField was caught off guard by a question from another attendee: How does it feel to have dedicated your life to studying an ecosystem that will be the first one wiped off the planet?

“I'm rarely dumbfounded,” McField, who now serves as director of the Healthy Reefs for Healthy People initiative, told Gizmodo. Though she was well aware of the dire state the world's coral reefs were in, the idea that these ecosystems could be the first to succumb to climate change came as an alarming new realization. “I just didn't know what to say,” she said.

Today, McField is one of 160 authors of a landmark report confirming that the questioner that day may have been right. The 2025 Global Tipping Points Report, released by the University of Exeter and international partners on Sunday, finds that the world's warm-water coral reefs have become the first Earth system to cross its thermal tipping point.

The report comes as global ministers gather in Brazil to meet in preparation for the 30th annual UN Climate Change Conference in November. During these meetings, leaders attempt to reach some consensus on the key climate issues facing the planet. The report's authors hope their findings will help drive decision makers to take meaningful action to curb global warming.

“We need to have stubborn people at the table in these negotiations who say, ‘We want to keep coral reefs on the planet,'” McField said.

Higher ocean temperatures are forcing many of the world's corals to expel the symbiotic algae, or zooxanthellae, that live in their tissues—a process known as coral bleaching. These algae not only give corals their signature bright colors, but also provide them with oxygen and essential nutrients through photosynthesis.

Earth is in the midst of its fourth global coral bleaching event, according to NOAA. Since January 2023, bleaching-level heat stress has impacted 84.4% of the world's coral reefs, with scientists documenting mass coral bleaching in at least 83 countries and territories. This is the second such event in the last 10 years and the largest on record.

The good news is this: Bleached corals are not necessarily dead corals. If ocean temperatures return to a cooler state for a sustained period of time, algae can recolonize a bleached reef. The bad news, however, is that climate change is increasing the severity of bleaching events while decreasing the amount of recovery time between them. As a result, the odds of corals bouncing back are rapidly dwindling.

“This is why ocean warming is such a scary thing,” Mark Hixon, a leading coral reef expert and professor of marine biology at the University of Hawaii who was not involved in the report, told Gizmodo. “Especially now with the ocean starting to warm very, very rapidly, we'll be seeing more frequent and more severe bleaching events.”

At what point does the global average temperature of Earth's oceans become so warm that the majority of coral reefs won't be able to survive bleaching events? This is where the idea of a thermal tipping point comes in. Researchers estimate the thermal tipping point for warm-water coral reefs to be 2.16 degrees Fahrenheit (1.2 degrees Celsius) of global surface warming above pre-industrial levels. The planet is already past that point.

Crossing this threshold doesn't mean that all the world's reefs are going to die tomorrow. “That's not what we're saying,” McField said. “We're saying we're in the zone where death—the tipping of the whole ecosystem—is underway.”

Each coral reef is unique, with different species, local water temperatures, non-thermal stressors, ecosystem intactness, and resilience levels. These and other factors shape a reef's survivability. But in a warming world, all reefs—regardless of their individual conditions and characteristics—are at greater risk.

“Let's say we've got 100 humans, and they all go to the doctor,” McField said. “All of them have cholesterol levels of 300—which is incredibly dangerous. They're still going to die at different rates.”

The report finds that Earth's global surface temperature may rise 2.7°F (1.5°C) above pre-industrial levels within the next 10 years. This is the upper range of the thermal tipping point for warm-water coral reefs.

At that point, “We're in new territory,” McField said. Even under the most optimistic scenario, in which global warming stabilizes at 2.7°F without any overshoot, warm-water coral reefs are “virtually certain” to tip, the report states.

Scientists around the world are working to protect and restore coral reefs. Some strategies center on improving coral resilience through genetic modification—selectively breeding them for resiliency traits.

“This can work to some degree, to keep from losing species entirely,” McField said.

“But when you think about how that could ever be applied on an ecosystem scale, with so little money going into on-the-ground work in reef countries… how is that going to be an economic option?”

Other strategies aim to minimize other potential stressors, like pollution or destructive fishing practices. Hixon, for example, is working to improve water quality and protect herbivorous fish species in Hawaii, which could reduce the overall strain on coral reefs and help them rebound from bleaching events.

Still, this work can't mitigate all the effects of rapidly rising temperatures. The report states that the Earth needs stringent emission mitigation and enhanced carbon removal to bring the global average surface temperatures back down to 1.8°F (1°C) above pre-industrial levels. “These temperatures are essential for retaining functional warm-water coral reefs at meaningful scale,” the report says.

“It's incumbent upon the scientific community to engage with stakeholders of all kinds on the threats to the reefs, how they're accelerating, and how there are certain tangible steps we can take to try to save our reefs from loss,” Hixon said.

Three individual chargers taking up space on your desk or night table is frustrating as hell: A brick for the laptop, a cable for the phone, and another one for the wireless earbuds. Tangled mess of wires and used-up outlets that will leave you questioning why the heck we live in the year 2025 and still we can't get away from this mess.

Good news? Amazon recently lowered the price of the Anker Prime 250W charging station to $99 from the original price of $169, and this device can juice all your devices (it has 6 ports: 4 USB-C and 2 USB-A) simultaneously from one slim unit on the desk or table next to your bed. This is a flash sale at an all-time low price, and once Amazon burns through its inventory, that's it.

See at Amazon

The Anker Prime 250W charger employs Gallium Nitride (GaN) tech that is a semiconductor that conducts electricity approximately seven times better than the conventional silicon-based chargers. This translates to less power being dissipated as heat and additional power being put towards charging your device. The end product is a desktop power station that is hardly over 4 inches wide but can produce a whopper 250 watts through six ports at once — four USB-C ports along the front and two USB-A ports hidden on the side.

The initial USB-C port produces up to 140W of power which is sufficient power to power a MacBook Pro to 50% in 25 minutes. This is ideal in those instances where you want your laptop charged quickly prior to a meeting or flight. The remaining three USB-C ports reach a maximum of 100W each, which is still extremely fast and sufficient to fast-charge any smartphone, tablet, or even the majority of existing laptops found on the market today. The two USB-A ports produce 22.5W each  which is suitable for older peripherals or devices that are yet to convert to USB-C.

What makes the charger even more special is that 2.26-inch LCD front display: The display lets you exactly know how much power each port is putting out in real time so that you can instantly know what devices are charging and what the charging speed is. There is even a manual control knob on one side that lets you set charging priorities as well as toggle between different power modes without having to unplug anything.

The four modes that the charger presents are AI Power Mode (automatically balances power distribution), Dual-Laptop Mode (divides power equally between the first two USB-C ports, operating at 70W each, to charge two laptops), Port Priority Mode (maxes power over one designated port), and Low Current Mode (caps the charging speed to facilitate overnight charging to preserve the health of the battery). The latter mode is a lifesaver if you are the kind who charges overnight and wishes to prolong the lifespan of your device battery by preventing repeated fast charging.

The intelligent control dial makes it very easy to switch between these modes. Just turn the dial to go through the menu, press to choose, and you're set. You can even connect the charger to the Anker app over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to control it remotely and monitor it: The app will schedule the charging hours so the devices will be charged when you need them to be charged and you can even use the display as a desktop clock if nothing is connected.

Despite having 250W of power and six ports, the Anker Prime is no bigger than 4.18 x 1.58 x 3.64 inches in size and weighs as little as 22.58 ounces. This compact size is possible with the aid of GaN tech, the type that allows components to be packed together a bit tighter without the components over-heating. The build quality also feels high-end, with a brushed silver metal construction that looks great on any desk or nightstand. The charger includes ActiveShield 3.0 tech, which tracks temperature a whopping 6 million times per day to ensure your devices stay protected during charging.

At $99 rather than $169, this is the lowest price the Anker Prime 250W has ever sold at. It's uncommon to see a charger this strong with so many features go as low as $100, let alone one that is made by a reputable company like Anker that supports this with a 24-month warranty. When this stock is gone, there can be no guarantee that Amazon will replenish stock or that they will release the product at this price point.

SpaceX's Starship megarocket is back on the launch pad at Boca Chica, prepared and ready for its final flight test of the year. Flight 11, scheduled to lift off on Monday evening at the earliest, will also be the final test flight for this iteration of Starship, Version 2—if everything goes to plan.

The launch window will open at 7:15 p.m. Eastern on Monday, October 13, according to SpaceX. A livestream of the event will begin approximately 30 minutes before liftoff, which you can watch at SpaceX.com or the company's account on X. You can also tune in through any of the third-party webcasts below.

 

Last week, SpaceX shared photos of Starship's Super Heavy booster set up on its pad at Starbase, the company's launch site in Boca Chica, Texas. The rocket's upper stage, called Starship or “Ship” for short, is stacked on top of the booster ahead of its flight.

Starship is the largest and most powerful rocket ever built. Altogether, it stands about 400 feet (122 meters) tall. But SpaceX is going bigger: The next iteration of Starship—Version 3—will be even larger and capable of carrying 100 tons (363 metric tons) to orbit, according to CEO Elon Musk. Its first launch is expected sometime in early 2026.

But before SpaceX can roll out Version 3, the company needs this last test of Version 2 to go smoothly. It's last test, Flight 10, which lifted off from Starbase in August, went off without a hitch. But that launch followed a string of explosive failures that had put Starship off-track.

For this test, Starship will follow a very similar flight plan to its last launch, just with a few tweaks to further stress-test the rocket's heat shield and demonstrate maneuvers that are designed to mimic how its upper stages will behave when it is returning to its launch site—Starhsip, after all, is meant to be fully reusable.

In the eleventh test flight, Starship's Super Heavy Booster is supposed to splash down in the Gulf of Mexico while, its upper stage progresses along a suborbital arc, then reenters the atmosphere for a water landing in the Indian Ocean, according to SpaceX.

The test will attempt several in-space objectives, including a deployment of eight dummy Starlink satellites and a relight of one of its Raptor engines. SpaceX has again removed several ceramic tiles from the heat shield to stress-test the rocket's thermal protection system.

Unlike flight 10, however, this time the spacecraft will perform a “dynamic banking maneuver” during the final phase of the rocket's reentry, designed to mimic the path it will take on future flights returning to Starbase.

The booster will also demonstrate a “unique landing burn engine configuration planned to be used on the next generation of Super Heavy,” according to SpaceX. The booster will ignite 13 of its 33 engines to start the burn, transition to five engines to fine-tune its trajectory, then downshift to three center engines for the final stage of the burn.

The booster selected for this launch is flight-proven, having already flown on flight 8 in March. Twenty-four of the booster's Raptor engines are also flight-proven. This will be the second reuse of a Super Heavy booster, a critical test of SpaceX's rapid reusability strategy.

It's been a turbulent year for the Starship program. After a very shaky start to the rocket's 2025 launch schedule, SpaceX is now under pressure to reach critical development milestones ahead of its next iteration. Monday's launch is one you won't want to miss.

Just when we were getting settled in with Wi-Fi 7…

Consumer Wi-Fi 7 devices have only been around for a couple of years at this point, but as we all know, technological progress doesn't stand still. There's always a push for making hardware faster, more secure, and more reliable. Wireless technologies are no exception, which means that the organizing bodies behind Wi-Fi are already looking forward to the next generation: Wi-Fi 8 (802.11bn).

Although details at this point are relatively light, TP-Link announced today that it has conducted its first successful trials of Wi-Fi 8 hardware using a prototype device. The company didn't specify the hardware it used to achieve its Wi-Fi 8 milestone, referring only to a “joint industry partnership.” However, there are several big names in the Wi-Fi chip market, including Broadcom, Qualcomm, Intel, MediaTek, and Marvell. TP-Link has been known to work closely with Qualcomm to supply chipsets for its Wi-Fi 7 portfolio, so it's plausible to assume that the partnership could extend to Wi-Fi 8 hardware.

According to the company, its testing has validated the Wi-Fi 8 beacon and data throughput, marking a “critical milestone in Wi-Fi 8 development.”

You can read more about TP-Link's early development with Wi-Fi 8 on the information page that it created.

We learned last year that the overarching goal of Wi-Fi 8 is not to bring extraordinary theoretical speed improvements (although we'll likely see some generational advances), but to improve overall reliability and real-world performance. Wi-Fi 8 will still utilize three bands (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz) and will retain the 4096 QAM and 320 MHz of maximum channel bandwidth introduced with Wi-Fi 7. While the maximum data rate remains at 46 Gbps, Wi-Fi 8's Ultra High Reliability (UHR) goal is to improve real-world data rate by up to 25 percent for compliant devices.

 




In addition, four new technologies are aimed at improving various aspects of Wi-Fi life, as described in a MediaTek whitepaper: Coordinated Spatial Reuse (Co-SR), Coordinated Beamforming (Co-BF), Dynamic Sub-Channel Operation (DSO), and enhanced Modulation Coding Scheme (MCS). For example, Co-SR monitors power levels to deliver optimal signal strength between devices, while DSO can assign sub-channels to a device to boost throughput by up to 80 percent.

So, what does all of this mean for general consumers? If you reside in a dense urban environment, you can expect higher overall performance with reduced interference from competing wireless signals. In addition, you'll notice fewer interruptions when roaming and better performance under low-signal situations.

Wi-Fi 8 is preceded by Wi-Fi 7, and we first started seeing the first commercial-grade hardware in our lab in late 2023. Those initial Wi-Fi 7 products were costly, with the Amazon Eero 7 Max mesh router costing $599 for just a single node and $1,699 for a three-pack. Luckily, the prices for Wi-Fi 7 routers have come down dramatically since then. You can purchase a dual-band router for around $100, a tri-band router for under $200, and a tri-band mesh router for roughly $300 on sale.

However, with the new wireless standard on the horizon, we can expect those Wi-Fi 7 prices to drop further as we prepare for the inevitable price premium of Wi-Fi 8 hardware.

The bug was introduced in a Sept 29 update, Windows 10 support ends October 14

Here's an example of the most unfortunate timing for Microsoft and its OS users. The latest version of the Windows Media Creation Tool (MCT), released just a fortnight ago, “might close unexpectedly, displaying no error message,” admits Microsoft in a status update (h/t Windows Latest). Of course, Windows 10 goes EOL on October 14, and MCT was one of the most popular methods of preparing update media for Windows 11.

If you head on over to the linked Microsoft status page, you will see Microsoft has a prominent blue box advising users about the upcoming Windows EOL. In brief, it means “devices running Windows 10 will no longer receive fixes for known issues, time zone updates, technical support, or monthly security and preview updates containing protection from the latest security threats,” in Microsoft's words.

 




Scroll a little further down, though, and a wrinkle that could stall some upgraders is listed as ‘Confirmed' on October 10. Specifically, the Windows 11 MCT “might not work as expected on Windows 10.” A typical symptom will be that the tool closes unexpectedly, with no error message. Windows Latest was able to replicate this issue. Is ‘oof' the correct word?

 




Microsoft's terrible timing is quite comical, but thankfully, users still have at least a couple of pretty simple ways to migrate to the latest version of Windows, if that is what they have decided to do. The tech giant is working to fix the MCT issue, but in the meantime, willing Windows 11 migrants can try the following:

Remember, if your system isn't passing the Windows 11 upgrade minimum spec tests in Windows 10, the downloaded bootable ISO may need to be modified using a tool like Rufus – at your own risk. While you're at it, don't forget to enable local account setup if that is important for you.

We have a full and recently updated guide to bypassing Windows 11's TPM, CPU, and RAM requirements, which you may find useful. A number of Windows 10 stalwarts who wish to upgrade to something newer may instead be interested in testing one of the latest versions of Linux, like this one for older PCs, and one of these three for mainstream users.

Technology is compatible with existing semiconductor manufacturing methods.

A cross-institutional research team has published a paper where a breakthrough in (MRAM) development is detailed. According to a blog post published by Taiwan's National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU), which spearheaded the efforts, they have managed to overcome a major challenge that hampered the development and adoption of this kind of non-volatile memory. The researchers claim that their spin–orbit torque magnetic random-access memory (SOT-MRAM) is a true next-gen breakthrough as it offers ~1ns switching speeds, and data retention exceeding 10 years, among its multitude of attractions.

 




This latest SOT-MRAM development comes from a cross-institutional collaboration between Taiwan's National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU), leading chip foundry TSMC, Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC) in Taiwan, Stanford University, and National Chung Hsing University (NCHU) in Taiwan. We've covered the same team's earlier advances in building a SOT-MRAM array chip (Jan 2024) but much progress has been made since then.

The key advance presented in the recently published paper is the introduction of a tungsten layer to generate the spin currents. Specifically, the team managed to stabilize the rare beta-phase of Tungsten, which is crucial for increased performance – and will be even more important for eventual mass production of SOT-MRAM devices.

Last year, we noted that NYCU's SOT-MRAM was capable of latencies up to 10ns. Now it has been improved to ~1ns, rivaling SRAM, reveals testing of a 64kb array the scientists built. For further context, that is slightly faster than DRAM (DDR5 has latency around 14ms) and considerably faster than 3D TLC NAND (which has read latencies between 50 and 100 microseconds).

Don't forget, though, that this new SOT-MRAM brings the benefits of non-volatility. Other trumpeted advances delivered by the latest SOT-MRAM device demo were:

The research paper reveals that “the insertion of thin layers of cobalt can be used to stabilize β-tungsten under back-end-of-line-compatible thermal conditions.” With the new composite layers, the SOT-MRAM was tested to withstand extreme temperatures (up to 400 °C) for 10 hours, and even 700 °C for 30 mins.

With TSMC scientists among the collaborators, it isn't surprising to hear that these new SOT-MRAM devices are being designed for large-scale integration under existing semiconductor industry-compatible processes. Almost inevitably, the SOT-MRAM is now being pitched at the AI data center market, as well as low-power computing applications at the edge, where speed and non-volatility will also help spur adoption.

The Chinese chairman was also removed and will be replaced by a non-Chinese person with a ""deciding vote"" in due time.

The Dutch government has taken the ""exceptional"" step of seizing control of strategically important Dutch chip maker Nexperia from its Chinese owner, Wingtech, as nationalist instincts continue to shape the semiconductor industry.

The government says it is concerned that important technologies could be transferred to the Chinese parent company, according to Reuters. With this manoeuvre, it can block any such attempts, maintaining this ""crucial technological knowledge and capabilities on Dutch and European soil.""

Nexperia is one of the largest companies in the world when it comes to manufacturing simple silicon components such as the diodes and transistors, MOSFETs, and logic gates that are found in all manner of modern electronics. Wingtech has been on the United States ""entity list"" for the past year, highlighting it as a potential security concern. That list was expanded in September to include subsidiaries of those companies, suggesting Nexperia itself may have come up as a potential security concern.

Although not confirmed, that causal link is there, and the Dutch government has firmly taken control of the company. A Dutch judge ousted the Chairman, Zhang Xuezheng, earlier this month. Wingtech has now pledged to replace him with a non-Chinese person in due course.

The government will also now be able to block or reverse any management decisions it sees as harmful, though regular company operation will continue at its various facilities around the world, including factories in Germany and the UK.

The decision to take control of Nexperia came following ""acute signals of serious administrative shortcomings and actions"" at the company, according to the Dutch government. ""These signals threaten the continuity and safeguarding of crucial technological knowledge and capabilities on Dutch and European soil.""

""The loss of these capabilities could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security,"" it added. For its part, Wingtech said it was speaking to lawyers and seeking government help to ""protect the legitimate rights and interests of the company.""

It's not clear what technologies in particular the Dutch government is keen to protect, but semiconductor companies all over the world are now seen as important for strategic defense reasons as they commercial opportunities. Modern processors are required for the latest high-tech drones and missile technologies, as well as high-end infrastructure and modern AI developments, making them technologies that governments the world over are looking to husband and protect.

As many countries around the world look to build up their semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and control their own AI-data centers, we're starting to see more of a multi-polar world trading economy, more so than the highly interlinked one of recent years.

The worst RTX 5070 Ti in the world, or the best RX 580?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


We've seen countless repair stories, shunt mods, and even custom-designed GPUs before, but nothing quite compares to a project like this. Marrying together one of the most iconic graphics cards ever released — AMD's RX 580 — with a modern-day heavyweight like the RTX 5070 Ti in the most unexpected way possible, Brazilian YouTuber and technician Paulo (from Paulo Games) has just performed a miracle. He sacrificed the soul of a GPU to breathe life into another, birthing a Frankenstein monstrosity that actually works.

Originally spotted by Videocardz, our journey starts in Brazil, where a dead RTX 5070 Ti got carbonized in a lightning surge so badly, the shock burnt a literal hole through its PCB. That means a sudden arc flowed across the GPU that was beyond any voltage the card could handle, and in the process, a part of the board ruptured, specifically the top-left corner where the VRMs sit. At this point, any sane person would consider a tax write-off as the best possible course of action for an expensive, dead GPU, but not our host.

See, the core was fine, and even the memory; it was only the power delivery systems that were affected, which implied a way out was possible — all you needed was some (insanely) clever bit of circuitry work. Aided by schematics and a few wires, just bridge together the lost traces, jump a few components, and make sure nothing short-circuits. Easy, right? Wrong.

There were no core voltages in the 5070 Ti, and the card only showed signs of life when it was tricked into supplying current to the PCIe power and memory voltage lanes.

This is where the RX 580 makes its entry. It's a donor board, so it actually doesn't have a GPU, but it does have a working power delivery system with VRMs that can serve as the lifeblood for another card. Thus, we begin the surgery, carefully siphoning power from the RX 580 to the RTX 5070 Ti's main voltage lines: MSVDD and NVDD.

Paulo initially planned to solder 14 power wires between both cards, but then reduced that number down to just six after some experimentation, and also added a 3V line for PEX (logic enable). Lastly, an aftermarket GPU cooler was mounted on the RX 580's PCB — which itself was sitting on top of the 5070 Ti — to keep this incendiary apparatus under control.

It's worth noting that AMD and Nvidia handle power management very differently, so that introduced another layer of challenge (and risk); therefore, the wires connecting the VRMs were shielded heavily to ensure they could handle the heat from the high voltage flowing through the cards.

Following the necessary precautions, which included a fire extinguisher, Paulo also repaired broken video output traces so the card could actually be tested. Once everything was plugged in, our ""Brasília"" (Frankstein in Portuguese) GPU actually powered on, posts, drawing around ~19W upon startup.

After fiddling around with video drivers, they achieved a stable image, which confirms the experiment worked. They stopped before doing any stress-testing because that would certainly melt the wires, or at least impose some level of serious danger. This is where Paul teases a second part where all warnings are thrown out the window in the name of science — or, in other words, refining the makeshift power delivery system to actually make it stable enough to play games.

Tramadol, a commonly prescribed opioid often viewed as a safer option for chronic pain, provided limited pain relief while increasing the risk for serious side effects, results of a new analysis showed.

In a systematic review and meta-analysis, investigators found that tramadol offered clinically insignificant pain relief, while doubling the likelihood of serious adverse events, most commonly cardiac complications.

“Given the limited analgesic benefits and increased risk of harm, tramadol use for chronic pain should be reconsidered,” Jehad Ahmad Barakji, MD, of the Centre for Clinical Intervention Research at Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen, Denmark, told Medscape Medical News.

“Across different chronic pain conditions, tramadol's pain-relieving effect appears modest, and while some patients may experience relief, most will not gain substantial benefit,” he added.

However, the researchers cautioned that the certainty of the evidence was low-to-moderate and that the quality of the underlying trials varied substantially.

The study was published on October 7 in BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine.

Tramadol, a dual-action opioid that modulates serotonin and norepinephrine pathways, has long been promoted as a middle-ground analgesic — less addictive than morphine but stronger than nonopioid medications. It is approved for moderate-to-severe pain, including postoperative and chronic conditions.

Prescriptions have risen sharply worldwide, fueled by perceptions of safety and a belief that tramadol carries a lower risk for dependence. A recent global analysis estimated that nearly 18% of adults have used tramadol in their lifetime, and more than 80% of those users combined it with at least one other substance.

Despite its widespread use, evidence supporting tramadol's long-term effectiveness and safety in chronic pain has been limited and inconsistent. Previous research has largely focused on short-term or condition-specific outcomes, such as osteoarthritis or neuropathic pain, leaving uncertainty about the drug's overall risk-benefit profile.

The current study is the first comprehensive systematic review to evaluate tramadol alone for chronic pain using both meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis, providing a broader view of efficacy and safety across pain types.

“We sought to fill this gap by evaluating the totality of evidence to guide clinical practice,” Barakji said.

The analysis included 19 randomized, placebo-controlled trials with 6569 adults. The average participant age was 56 years, and study durations ranged from 4 to 16 weeks. Pain intensity was typically assessed with the 0-10 numeric rating scale (NRS), while function and quality of life were measured with validated patient-reported tools.

Across the pooled analysis, participants receiving tramadol experienced an average pain reduction of 0.9 points on the NRS compared with placebo — a difference below the one-point threshold considered clinically meaningful. About 7% more patients in the tramadol groups achieved noticeable pain relief, but investigators said the benefit was modest and uncertain.

Serious adverse events were twice as common among tramadol users, most often involving cardiac complications such as chest pain, coronary artery disease, or heart failure. Nonserious side effects, including nausea, dizziness, constipation, and drowsiness, were frequent and contributed to higher discontinuation rates among tramadol recipients.

The researchers acknowledged that most included trials were at a high risk for bias due to incomplete outcome reporting, small sample sizes, and inconsistent assessment methods, factors that may have exaggerated benefits and underestimated harms.

Commenting on the research, Jessica Otte, MD, clinical associate professor in the Department of Family Medicine at The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, said the new review stands out for examining tramadol's use across a range of chronic pain conditions, an area where clinicians often struggle to help patients achieve meaningful and sustained relief.

Otte, who has studied the drug's safety and effectiveness through The University of British Columbia's Therapeutics Initiative, said the Danish team's analysis expands on earlier research that largely focused on single pain conditions. The findings, she said, add weight to growing evidence that challenges tramadol's perceived advantages over other analgesics.

“This review doesn't change the narrative but strengthens it: Tramadol's reputation as a safer or uniquely effective opioid is increasingly difficult to defend,” she told Medscape Medical News.

While she believes the study makes an important contribution, Otte said the results should be interpreted with caution because of gaps in the underlying evidence. The Danish authors noted similar concerns, and Otte agreed that many of the included trials had methodological shortcomings.

“A lot of the studies had biases that made us less certain about what was reported,” she said. “Many outcomes that matter to patients — like quality of life, functional improvement, or withdrawal — were either inconsistently measured or not reported at all.”

She added that patients assigned to tramadol were more likely to discontinue early, both overall and because of side effects, raising concern about tolerability and attrition bias.

Also commenting, Houman Danesh, MD, professor and medical director of pain management at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, said the review provides moderate-certainty evidence that tramadol increases the risk for serious adverse events; but its broad approach — evaluating efficacy and safety across multiple chronic pain conditions — could be a confounding factor.

“Tramadol may benefit some conditions more than others,” he noted, which could alter the overall risk-benefit profile.

In his clinical experience, Danesh said severe complications such as cardiac events are uncommon. He explained that heart rhythm disturbances occasionally associated with tramadol generally arise when patients are taking other medications that affect cardiac conduction.

Danesh emphasized that clinicians should weigh the study alongside other research and their own experience when deciding whether to prescribe the drug.

“It's important to take this study into consideration,” he said, “but there are multiple studies that support the use of tramadol, and we have to look at the totality of the evidence.”

The authors declared no competing interests and received no specific grant from any funding agency. Otte and Danesh reported no relevant financial relationships.

How to maximize your time during STEP-dedicated studying. 

STEP-dedicated studying is a period of 2-4 weeks in medical school when you can strictly focus on studying. It can be kind of overwhelming to have no lectures or class to go to and studying being all on you.

My first and most important tip is going to be writing out a calendar outline for the next 2-4 weeks. Write out exactly which days you want to take what practice tests, and which days you will be reviewing them. This way you can get a general structure and make sure that you are able to complete all of the practice questions before exam day.

This will really allow you to stay on track and see realistically how much more material you have to get through in order to be ready for exam day. 

This is one of the most important things that you can do.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is steadily reshaping diabetes care, from diagnostic advances to providing new tools that lighten patients' daily management burden, according to experts in the field.

“One of the biggest benefits of AI in diabetes management is the maturation of the hybrid closed-loop insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor systems,” said Yaa A. Kumah-Crystal, MD, associate professor of Biomedical Informatics and Pediatric Endocrinology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. As these systems evolve, she said, the goal is to automate more aspects of glycemic control and insulin dosing while giving users greater flexibility.

In a recent review in Endocrine Practice, Francisco Javier Pasquel, MD, of Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, and colleagues detailed where AI is delivering value now and where it's headed.

“Clinically relevant AI is rapidly advancing across screening, risk prediction, decision support, and device optimization, with regulators and health systems beginning to adopt these tools,” Pasquel told Medscape Medical News. “Given this pace, clinicians need a current map of what's real, what works, and what's next.”

Pasquel and colleagues noted that AI tools for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy and managing its associated complications are particularly primed for real-world application. US FDA-cleared AI systems now support automated retinal assessments that, in controlled settings, approach specialist-level diagnostic accuracy.

“This technology expands access to timely screening, particularly in primary care environments and in low-resource settings, including low-income countries, to address shortages of trained ophthalmologists,” Pasquel noted, while cautioning that many other potentially high-impact AI applications remain early in development.

Machine learning models that analyze thermograms and skin images are being studied to help pinpoint ischemia and infection in lesions associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Predictive models are also improving risk stratification for incident diabetes, complications, hospitalizations, and hospital readmissions, helping clinicians target preventive care and resources.

Pasquel highlighted the promise of next-generation automated insulin delivery algorithms, which aim to detect and respond to unannounced meals and integrate contextual data (eg, exercise or sleep patterns) to optimize insulin delivery and reduce hypoglycemia risk.

He also pointed to a recent consensus statement by Peter G. Jacobs, PhD, of Oregon Health & Science University and colleagues, which outlines how machine learning is being embedded into sensors and drug delivery devices, identifying patterns that can improve individual health outcomes. However, the authors acknowledged that limited datasets and wide variability in glucose dynamics among individuals with diabetes make effective algorithm development challenging.

“Some of the most promising AI tools on the horizon allow us to synthesize the large amounts of data patients generate,” Kumah-Crystal told Medscape Medical News.

She gave the example of correlating a patient's activity readings from their smartwatch with indicators such as heart rate to better gauge medication effects.

“Many of the tests that we have in endocrinology are invasive blood tests, but there are likely many other pieces of metadata, if patients would like to share them, that could be used with AI to build a more complete picture of their health,” Kumah-Crystal said.

As these tools mature, she envisions AI acting as a “coach and cheerleader,” providing timely insights and education and offering reminders about medications and appointments to engage patients in their own care.

Kumah-Crystal noted that limitations currently surround the use of AI tools, especially in pediatrics and rare endocrine conditions.

“Many generative large language models may not have a clear understanding of the treatment and pathology of some of these rare conditions and are more likely to hallucinate and make up information about treatment strategies when that information is not in their training set,” she said.

This makes it imperative, she added, for academic institutions to vet consumer-facing AI tools and develop better patient education around potential shortcomings.

Pasquel pointed to additional hurdles, including inconsistent performance, variable data quality, biased datasets, and persistent concerns around privacy and interoperability. He called for standardized development and validation practices, adopting transparent and privacy-preserving approaches, seamless electronic health record integration, and ongoing human oversight.

“Regulatory processes, which often lag behind technological advances, will also need to adapt, incorporating more agile, risk-based review pathways to ensure that safe and effective tools reach clinical practice in a timely manner,” he emphasized.

Despite the challenges, evidence that AI can shift long-term outcomes for diabetes management is beginning to emerge. In a recent publication in NEJM Catalyst, Kevin Pantalone, DO, director of diabetes initiatives at the Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, and colleagues reported a 52-week randomized trial of an AI-enabled program (Twin Precision Treatment) in adults with type 2 diabetes.

The intervention paired a smartphone app with four connected sensors (a continuous glucose monitor, an activity sensor, a smart scale, and a blood pressure meter), which delivered personalized recommendations about food choices, physical activity, and sleep, and included deep breathing exercises. The 100 patients in the intervention arm were compared with 50 patients receiving usual care.

At 12 months, 71% of participants in the AI intervention group achieved A1c < 6.5% without glucose-lowering medications other than metformin vs 2.4% with usual care. Furthermore, 22.6% of the intervention group reached that target with no glucose-lowering medications at all compared with 1.0% of the usual care group.

Overall, 88% of individuals randomized to using the AI intervention remained engaged with it for 12 months, which supports the favorability of the technology, and was reflected in improved treatment satisfaction and quality-of-life scores in the intervention group compared with the usual care group.

Pantalone told Medscape Medical News that he was struck by how readily patients across various ages and socioeconomic spectrums adopted the technology without difficulty, as well as just how effectively it performed.

“Not only did it improve blood sugar control and induce weight loss greater than usual care, but those benefits also occurred concurrently while the patients were stopping many of their glucose-lowering therapies, including GLP-1 receptor agonists.”

Pantalone cited access and adoption as the largest barriers to expanding AI in endocrinology. Although the system used in his study is commercially available and offered by some employers and health insurance plans, individuals cannot currently sign up independently to participate in a program or purchase the necessary technology at a retail location.

More randomized clinical trials, he added, are needed to support the benefits of AI-driven interventions in diabetes.

“Most of the benefits of AI-driven interventions for type 2 diabetes were based on companies' real-world experience and analysis of their commercial data, which are not generally appreciated by healthcare providers, health plan directors, or third-party payers as reliable evidence,” Pantalone said. “Now that we have very clear evidence, from a randomized controlled trial, I believe the use of AI in the management of diabetes will become more common.”

Pasquel disclosed receiving research support from Insulet, Tandem Diabetes Care, Ideal Medical Technologies, Novo Nordisk, and Dexcom; personal fees from Dexcom; and consulting fees to Emory from Insulet.

Kumah-Crystal reported having no financial conflicts of interest.

Pantalone disclosed receiving institutional consulting and research support paid to Cleveland Clinic from Twin Health for the current study; consulting fees from Bayer, Boehringer Ingelheim, Corcept Therapeutics, Diasome, Eli Lilly and Company, Merck, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi; speakers' honoraria from AstraZeneca, Corcept Therapeutics, and Novo Nordisk; research support to Cleveland Clinic from Bayer, Novo Nordisk, and Twin Health; and a patent application.

Had she known of other options, 50-year-old Tara Ballog, said she never would have gotten a hysterectomy.

Ballog's heavy periods started in her early forties — a normal part of aging, she thought. But after a friend told her not being able to get out of bed because of bleeding was not normal, she went to the emergency room.

There, doctors found three fibroids in her uterus. Blood tests revealed her iron count was also dangerously low. At the hospital, a gynecologist asked her if she was planning to have children. At 47, Ballog said she was not.

“They didn't discuss any alternatives to hysterectomy,” she said.

She was told after surgery to not lift any weight during recovery. But Ballog was in a wheelchair because of a permanent spinal cord injury. She had to transfer herself from her chair several times a day. Her physician, it seemed, had not taken her disability into consideration when only recommending hysterectomy.

Research shows Ballog is just one of many women with fibroids who are not told about treatment options other than surgeries like hysterectomy. Minimally invasive procedures include uterine fibroid embolization (UFE) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA), among others.

A recent study published in JAMA Network Open found nearly three fourths of women who had uterine fibroids removed underwent hysterectomy compared with 23% who underwent myomectomy and 3.5% who had UFE. And the older a woman was, the more likely she was to have a hysterectomy.

Despite gaining popularity since its introduction in 1995, “UFE remains significantly underutilized not because of its inefficacy but because of the lack of knowledge” about the procedure, said Tarig Elhakim, MD, a hospitalist at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, who led the new study. “Every woman deserves to know all of their options.”

In a clinical practice paper published last year in The New England Journal of Medicine, gynecologists from Mayo Clinic pushed for their colleagues to rely more heavily on uterus-sparing approaches for fibroid treatment, such as hormone therapy, UFE, RFE, and focused ultrasound ablation.

Advances in UFE have transformed the procedure over the past few decades, but awareness among gynecologists has not kept pace, said Amin Astani, MD, an interventional radiologist at North Star Fibroid Clinic in Minneapolis. In the 90s, patients would experience painful cramps for a few days following UFE, and some ended up hospitalized with a pain pump.

“Now we do nerve blocks and UFE doesn't require hospitalization at all,” Astani said.

At the time, researchers also did not know the effect UFE would have on fertility, which could be a reason some gynecologists still do not mention the procedure to their patients, Astani said. Researchers have estimated the fertility rate following the procedure to be between 40% and 60%.

Lack of collaboration between specialties may also play a role in why so many women are only offered surgery for fibroid treatment, Astani said. While gynecologists can provide surgical procedures and medical treatments like intrauterine devices (IUDs), minimally invasive treatments can only be performed by a radiologist.

Kristin Riley, MD, a minimally invasive gynecological surgeon at Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania, said she regularly collaborates with her interventional radiology colleagues to determine if a candidate is a good fit for minimally invasive procedures. But she said this coordination is not possible for every clinician.

“I'm lucky to be at a big academic center that has a lot of specialists and subspecialists,” she said.

UFE and other minimally invasive interventions may not be indicated for all patients, Astani said. UFE causes fibroids to shrink, but they remain in the body and are reabsorbed. In some cases, fibroids are too large and must be surgically removed. Some UFE experts put the threshold at 10 cm but can range up to 14 cm. Astani said no formal cutoff exists and physicians use their “professional opinion” to decide at what size a fibroid is too large for a minimally invasive procedure.

For fibroids that extend into the abdomen, myomectomy may be a better option to preserve the uterus, he said.

Astani said he also regularly sends patients back to their gynecologists if he recommends hysterectomy or myomectomy instead of UFE.

“I do so nearly every week,” he said.

Most clinicians are not acting “nefariously” if they recommend a hysterectomy for a patient who has fibroids, said James Greenberg, MD, chief of gynecology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Physicians are often most comfortable with the interventions they are trained in, and many are not often exposed to less invasive alternatives, he said.

Greenberg said his approach to fibroid treatment is to start with the least invasive options when possible and said gynecologists across the country can take the same approach, whether or not they have close colleagues in other specialties. Medication or an IUD are usually his first-line treatments, particularly if the patient is experiencing bleeding rather than bulk symptoms such as bloating, abdominal fullness, and constipation.

“Then I am going through the list of things I think have the least negative sequelae,” Greenberg said. “If I can fix the problem with something that is minimally body-changing, that's my next choice.”

Although Greenberg said he refers many patients to interventional radiology for UFE, he also regularly performs radiofrequency ablation. Greenberg also tells patients the downside of trying less invasive options first is generally low.

“If I do a hysterectomy and you feel better, that is great, but if I do a hysterectomy and you don't feel like yourself, I can't make you whole,” he said. “That doesn't mean hysterectomy is not a good option for a lot of patients. My last choice is always the things I cannot reverse, and I still do a lot of hysterectomies.”

Patients who have fibroids embedded in muscle also may not be good candidates for nonsurgical fixes. And less-invasive surgery such as myomectomy may also be too risky for some people with multiple fibroids.

“Sometimes myomectomy is much more complicated,” depending on the size, location, and number of fibroids, Riley said.

Even when hysterectomy is the best option for a patient, clinicians should go over other options and explain reasoning for recommending against them, she said.

“I really try to lay out the pros and cons of each option and have shared decision-making with patients,” Riley said. “I think the phrase, ‘you need a hysterectomy,' is really jarring.”

Ballog said she wishes her physician would have taken that approach.

“I wish the doctors would have had more of a conversation with me, that if something else was available, they would have discussed the options rather than, ‘so you don't want to have kids, you can have a hysterectomy,” she said.

Hi, everyone. Dr Chandrasekaran here. Today, I'm going to talk about pleural effusions from heart failure. 

This is a very common diagnosis that we see in the hospital and is co-managed between pulmonary and cardiology. The increased hydrostatic pressure from heart failure allows fluid to retain within the chest cavity itself around the lungs. This can cause an impediment to some people in terms of their breathing. 

We usually manage these by diuretic therapy, allowing the patient to pee out the fluid, along with goal-directed medical therapy for the heart failure or the problem itself.

Now, there have been controversial issues and topics surrounding thoracentesis around this topic. As pulmonologists, this is something we commonly do perform. However, in patients with heart failure, it's important to remember to treat the underlying cause. 

If somebody is feeling symptomatic with increasing shortness of breath and there is a large pleural effusion, then we can do a thoracentesis. However, recent trials, including the TAP-IT trial, which was just done in February 2025, do not show any benefit when done.

The FDA has approved an expanded indication for risperidone (Uzedy, Teva) extended-release injectable suspension, allowing it to be used for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder in adults, either as monotherapy or in combination with lithium or valproate. 

Uzedy was first approved in the US in 2023 for the treatment of adults with schizophrenia.

For bipolar I disorder, Uzedy was approved in three once-monthly dosing options (50 mg, 75 mg, and 100 mg). 

The approval of Uzedy for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder was based on previous findings of safety and efficacy of past risperidone formulations approved for the treatment of bipolar I disorder, the company said in a statement.

Approval was also tied to the efficacy, long-term safety and tolerability of Uzedy for the treatment of schizophrenia, including the RISE trial and SHINE study, both phase 3 pivotal studies, the company added. 

“Bipolar I disorder carries profound implications for a person's life and is linked to suboptimal long-term outcomes, with treatment adherence to daily oral options frequently presenting as a major impediment to effective care,” Craig Chepke, MD, medical director, Excel Psychiatric Associates, Huntersville, North Carolina, said in the statement. 

“The FDA's decision to expand the indication for Uzedy may help those living with [bipolar I disorder]. As a clinician, I am excited to now have a new treatment option for this complex disease,” Chepke said. 

Uzedy can cause serious side effects, especially in the elderly, and is not approved for use in patients with dementia-related psychosis. Complete prescribing information is available online.

HONOLULU — The investigational dopamine-1 (D1) receptor antagonist ecopipam (developed by Emalex Biosciences) is safe and effective for the improvement of Tourette syndrome (TS) symptoms in children, adolescents, and adults, new research showed.

In a phase 3 withdrawal trial of more than 100 patients, the pediatric subgroup receiving ecopipam had a 50% risk reduction for relapse compared with those receiving placebo, meeting the primary endpoint.

There was also a 50% risk reduction for active treatment vs placebo in the full study population, which included both pediatric and adult patients.

The most common adverse events (AEs) in the ecopipam group during 24 weeks (the 12-week double-blind period plus a 12-week open-label period) included somnolence, anxiety, and headache. Importantly, the drug was not associated with weight gain.

“As a clinician, I was excited to see that this was a positive study, with a side-effect profile that was pretty mild,” study investigator Kinga Tomczak, MD, PhD, pediatric neurologist and director of the Tic Disorders and Tourette Syndrome Program at Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, told Medscape Medical News.

“I hope it will become another option for our patients. We haven't had any new drugs for this disorder for a while,” added Tomczak, who is also an assistant professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School, Boston.

The study was presented on October 7 at the International Congress of Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders (MDS) 2025.

Most of the approved therapies for TS act at D2 receptors and “are limited by the risk for weight gain, metabolic abnormalities, and drug-induced movement disorders,” the investigators wrote.

“Most of the treatments we currently have are far from ideal because they can cause other issues. So there is a big need for something that will help but also not have bad side effects,” Tomczak added.

Ecopipam is a potentially first-in-class medication that blocks neurotransmitter dopamine action at the D1 receptor.

“D1 receptor supersensitivity may be a mechanism for the repetitive and compulsive behaviors associated with Tourette syndrome,” the company noted in a press release announcing preliminary top-line results earlier this year. The FDA has granted ecopipam Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations for pediatric patients with TS.

As previously reported by Medscape Medical News, the investigators presented results from a phase 2b trial of ecopipam vs placebo in pediatric patients at last year's MDS meeting.

In the current study, individuals older than 5 years and with TS entered into a 12-week open-label phase, during which they received only ecopipam. The medication was titrated up to a target dose of 1.8 mg/kg/d.

At the end of that period, those who experienced meaningful improvement — defined as at least a 25% reduction in the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale Total Tic Score (YGTSS-TTS) — went on to be randomly assigned to either continue receiving the target dose of ecopipam (n = 51; 73% male; 84% pediatric patients) or switched to placebo (n = 53; 66% male; 89% pediatric patients) during a 12-week double-blind period.

The primary endpoint was time from start of randomization to relapse (defined as at least a 50% decrease in the YGTSS-TTS improvement score from the open-label period) in the subgroup aged 6-17 years. Secondary endpoints included this same measure in the entire patient group and safety.

Results showed that pediatric members of the group who continued taking ecopipam had a significantly greater delay in time to relapse during the 12-week randomization period than their counterparts in the group who switched to placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.5; P = .008).

In the overall patient population, those receiving ecopipam also had a 50% risk reduction for relapse compared with those receiving placebo (HR, 0.5; P = .005).

These findings “support the maintenance and durability of the treatment effect,” Tomczak told meeting attendees.

Somnolence was the most frequent AE during the entire 24-week study period in those receiving the active treatment (11.1%), followed by anxiety or headache (9.7% for each), insomnia (8.8%), and tic worsening (7.9%).

There were no drug-induced movement disorder AEs attributed to the active treatment and “no signal of clinically relevant” metabolic AEs or weight gain.

“For extrapyramidal-related symptoms, we didn't observe any in any patient,” Tomczak said.

Tomczak noted that her team is now conducting an extension trial including patients from both the phase 3 and phase 2B studies, with some participants having taken the drug for over a year. They plan to continue monitoring the patients for 2-3 years to assess any long-term effects.

Commenting for Medscape Medical News, David Shprecher, DO, a movement disorders neurologist with Banner Sun Health Research Institute in Sun City, Arizona, and co-director of the Arizona Center of Excellence for TS consortium between Banner Health and Phoenix Children's Hospital, noted that the study had a novel design.

Shprecher said the treatment already established tolerability in the prior phase 2 study and showed “promising” efficacy for a short period. So the current trial sought to address longer-term efficacy.

“I think the study did that and really addressed the problem of placebo response in a novel way that we haven't seen in recent trials. It's more of a randomized withdrawal design,” he said.

Shprecher, who was not involved with the research and has TS himself, applauded the inclusion of adults in the study.

“I think that's important. While the treated population in neurologic clinics around the world is more likely to be pediatric, there definitely are adults who have persistent tics that are more severe and a source of disability,” Shprecher said.

“So it's important that we have information about how adults respond,” he added.

If approved in the future, Shprecher noted that the treatment could prove especially helpful for a specific group of patients.

“There's an important niche here, with patients who we may be concerned about regarding metabolic side effects from antipsychotics, like weight gain or increased cholesterol,” he said.

But with this medication, “we'd have an option where we wouldn't have to worry about those side effects. We really don't have any antipsychotics we can comfortably say don't have this risk,” Shprecher added.

The study was funded by Emalex Biosciences. Tomczak reported having served as a clinical trial site investigator for and receiving travel support from Emalex. She also received consulting fees from Emalex and Jazz Pharmaceuticals. Shprecher reported having been a member of the Data Safety Monitoring Board for the drug's phase 2 trial.

The ongoing US government partial shutdown has unintended consequences for seniors and their doctors as most telehealth appointments are now no longer being covered by Medicare.

That's because without a budget deal, federal lawmakers did not renew some pandemic-era telehealth flexibilities allowing Medicare beneficiaries to have medical appointments with doctors over audio or video at home.

This policy was first put into place under the first Trump administration in 2020 during the COVID pandemic. Previously, Medicare covered very limited telehealth services for rural patients.

For the past 5 years, lawmakers have always managed to renew the telehealth flexibilities in every government funding bill before the expiration date. This year, however, they expired for the first time on October 1.

Federal lawmakers remain at odds on the 2026 federal funding bill, meaning the shutdown could last into more days and even weeks.

But with Congress in a standoff, clinicians and patients outside Washington, DC, are already grappling with the consequences of the funding impasse.

For the South Dakota-based Sanford Health System, which is the largest rural health system in the country, the past week without the Medicare telehealth waivers being in place has caused a lot of anxiety and uncertainty for both patients and providers.

Dave Newman, an endocrinologist and chief medical officer of virtual care at Sanford, said the health system decided to keep providing Medicare telehealth appointments to patients for now.

“We're maintaining telehealth access because we know that's the best thing for our patients. We've got full confidence that reimbursement will follow, but patients can't wait for Congress to act at this point,” Newman told Medscape Medical News. “They still need access to their specialists. They still need access to their primary care providers, and this is one of the only ways that a lot of our patients get access. For them, it's either virtual care or no care at all.” 

Newman said as the shutdown continues, Sanford may reconsider whether it can keep providing these appointments without reimbursement.

Some health systems have stopped providing any Medicare telehealth appointments, said Alexis Apple, director of federal affairs at the American Telemedicine Association. That means patients must appear in person for their doctor's appointment or cancel.

NYU Langone Health system's website currently has a banner that reads: “Due to the federal government shutdown, Medicare and Medicaid patients are unable to schedule new telehealth/video visits. If you already have a visit scheduled, it will continue as planned. If not, contact your doctor's office to schedule an in-person appointment.” 

“It's creating lots of confusion in the industry, from patients, providers, hospital systems. You know, what do we do next? How do we grapple with this shutdown?” said Apple. “Patients have been able to receive care within their homes over the past five years, and now, all of a sudden, they've been stripped of that access.”

Medicare patients who continue telehealth after October 1 may find out they're on the hook for the bill, if Congress doesn't act, said Apple.

Some physicians worry that commercial insurance payers may follow suit and no longer cover virtual appointments. Medicare, which is the largest healthcare payer in the country, is often seen as the standard for what services should be covered.

Patients and doctors have come to rely on telehealth as an integral part of healthcare, said Richard Chou, an anesthesiologist at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in Sacramento, California.

“You're seeing that post-pandemic, telehealth is kind of a new way of doing things. It's part of the day for us as doctors,” said Chou. He said that many of his VA patients do their preliminary surgery appointments via telehealth before coming into the facility.

“Telehealth is that bridge to making sure patients get the care they need, and when these patients don't get that preliminary care they need, this builds up and builds up,” said Chou. “And next thing you know, you have people flooding the emergency rooms, and we can't have that.” 

With Congressional budget negotiations at an impasse, it remains unclear when the shutdown will end.

Healthcare spending disagreements weigh heavily in negotiations. Democrats are currently unwilling to give the votes to pass the 60-vote threshold in the Senate unless Republicans agree to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire at the end of the year. Democrats also want to reverse the Medicaid cuts that were part of the large Republican domestic tax and spending bill passed by Congress earlier this year.

When lawmakers do reach an agreement and reopen the government, it's likely telehealth flexibilities will be included in any package but for how long remains a question.

A newly introduced bipartisan bill would permanently allow Medicare patients to access telehealth appointments in their homes. But the legislation has been estimated to be very costly.

Federal data does show that telehealth appointments have been popular with Medicare recipients and increased over time since telehealth became more accessible.

“I used to say that virtual care was the future of medicine, and now it's just kind of the present of medicine. It used to be like a cool technology that we used to advertise, now it's just the standard of care,” said Newman. “We think that permanent coverage would mean stability for both patients and providers.”

A kidney organoid platform may reduce the need for laboratory animal models and provide a more reliable, relevant system for drug development, ultimately helping to reduce disease burden and improve quality of life for patients with kidney disease.

In a study published in Stem Cell Reports, investigators used induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from two patients homozygous for the APOL1 risk variants G1 and G2 to model APOL1-mediated kidney disease (AMKD) in kidney organoids.

Individuals carrying two APOL1 gene risk variants (G1 or G2) are at a higher risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Kidney organoids, three-dimensional tissue structures grown from iPSCs, are generated by exposing stem cells to a defined mix of factors that guide differentiation and self-organization into structures resembling fetal kidneys.

“By using iPSCs obtained from patients with a genetic kidney disorder, such as AMKD, we can create disease-specific kidney models. These organoid-based models allow us to study the disease mechanism at a molecular level in a reproducible and patient-specific manner, without causing any additional burden to the patient,” said study investigator H. Siebe Spijker, MD, clinical nephrologist at Leiden University Medical Center in Leiden, Netherlands.

Spijker's team generated stem cells from skin biopsies of patients with AMKD and turned them into kidney organoids to model aspects of human kidney function. In a subset of organoids, the APOL1 mutations were corrected by genetic engineering to create isogenic controls.

Using a panel of lab-based tests, the researchers found that APOL1 mutations impaired mitochondrial function, which is critical for respiration and energy production in the kidney. Podocytes, a cell type essential for filtration and the main source of APOL1 in the kidney, were particularly affected.

“The organoids reflect the underlying biology driving disease progression. While this study focused on AMKD, the approach is broadly applicable. iPSCs can be generated from any patient with a genetic kidney disease, enabling the development of tailored organoid models for a wide range of kidney diseases,” Spijker told Medscape Medical News.

Although the current work centers on disease mechanisms, the team intends to apply the model for drug discovery.

“This could involve targeted strategies based on the specific disease mechanism or a large-scale compound screening to uncover novel therapeutic targets,” Spijker said.

Mattia F.M. Gerli, MSc, PhD, associate professor of stem cell science and biomaterials at UCL Royal Free Hospital in London, England, said these findings have significant clinical implications and point toward completely new types of treatment.

“Organoids modelling is currently becoming a clinical reality for modelling human disease and testing therapeutics in a personalized manner. This piece is very timely, as it fits perfectly with the recent advancement in complex renal modelling using iPSC-derived organoids. Through this work, [the authors] help bring clarity on the underlying mechanisms of APOL1-mediated AMKD,” Gerli told Medscape Medical News.

Multiomics analysis demonstrated metabolic reprogramming in APOL1 risk variant podocytes, which also displayed functional and structural mitochondrial impairment.

“This advances our understanding on the effect of APOL1 in metabolic-mediated cell death, proposing mitochondria dysfunction as its core,” said Gerli, who was not involved in the study. “This work provides an innovative platform to study the condition and paves the way for future studies to conduct personalized modelling and to test genetic correction and therapeutic targets for this condition.”

Wake Forest University Health Sciences and study Co-author Barry I. Freedman have rights to a US patent related to APOL1 gene testing. Freedman is a consultant for and reported receiving research support from AstraZeneca. Spijker and Gerli reported having no financial disclosures.

Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT) with higher per-fraction doses improved overall response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared with a lower-dose regimen in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma (HGG).

Specifically, HSRT delivered as 27 Gy in three fractions or 30 Gy in five fractions improved ORR compared with 35 Gy in 10 fractions among patients receiving concurrent bevacizumab in a phase 2 trial. Feng Liu, MD, presented these new findings of the study at the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) 2025 Annual Meeting in San Francisco. Liu is the director of head and neck radiotherapy at Hunan Cancer Hospital in Changsha, China.

At 6 months, ORR was 79% and 74% for the 27 Gy and 30 Gy regimens, respectively, compared with 50% for the 35 Gy regimen (P = .023). Six-month PFS was 68% and 62% for the 27 Gy and 30 Gy regimens, respectively, compared with 47.1% for the 35 Gy regimen (P = .023). Overall survival was similar across arms — 85.3%, 79.4%, and 76.5% for the 27 Gy, 30 Gy, and 35 Gy regimens, respectively (P = .81).

Gliomas are the most prevalent primary malignancies of the central nervous system, and HGGs (World Health Organization [WHO] grades 3 and 4) have a high rate of recurrence and poor prognosis.

“The combination of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy and bevacizumab represents a promising treatment strategy for recurrent HGG. However, the optimal dose-fractionation pattern remains undefined,” Liu said. The regimens most commonly used in clinical practice are 27 Gy in three fractions, 30 Gy in five fractions, and 35 Gy in 10 fractions. No randomized trials have directly compared their efficacy, Liu noted.

In this phase 2 trial, investigators evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of each regimen given with concurrent bevacizumab. Adults with pathologically confirmed WHO grade 3-4 gliomas and unequivocal imaging evidence of progression within 21 days of enrollment were eligible. Tumor size could not exceed 3.5 cm. Patients received bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks), starting on day 1 of HSRT and continuing until progression.

The primary endpoint was ORR; secondary endpoints included PFS, overall survival at 6 months, and treatment-related toxicity. MRI was performed at 4 and 8 weeks after HSRT and every 3 months thereafter until progression or death, with evaluation by modified Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria, Liu said in an interview with Medscape Medical News.

A total of 102 patients were randomized (34 per group). About 40% and 60% had grade 3 and grade 4 disease, respectively.

Grade 1-2 adverse events occurred more frequently with the 27 Gy and 30 Gy regimens (47.1% and 44.1%) than with 35 Gy (17.6%). The most common were headache, nausea/vomiting, insomnia, alopecia, anorexia, and fatigue. Differences between the 27 Gy and 30 Gy regimens were not significant. Rates of grade 3-4 adverse events were comparable across groups: 29.4%, 32.3%, and 20.6% for the 27 Gy, 30 Gy, and 35 Gy regimens, respectively.

Multivariate analysis identified HSRT dose-fractionation, tumor grade, isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation, and 1p/19q codeletion status as significant predictors of PFS.

Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting VEGF, is often added to reirradiation for recurrent glioblastoma. This drug helps reduce symptomatic radiation necrosis and other radiation-related adverse effects, said Rupesh Kotecha, MD, chief of radiosurgery and director of the Central Nervous System Metastasis Program at Baptist Health Miami Cancer Institute, Miami.

The trial used modified RANO criteria to help distinguish true treatment response from the vascular effects seen with therapies such as bevacizumab. These vascular effects can make MRI results appear more favorable than the underlying disease. While the modified RANO criteria improve response assessment in patients treated with anti-VEGF therapy, additional literature suggests that these criteria don't entirely eliminate the interpretive challenges posed by bevacizumab-related imaging changes.

“Although overall response rates and progression-free survival estimates appeared higher in the three- and five-fraction cohorts, all patients received concurrent and adjuvant bevacizumab. Given bevacizumab's known effect on vascular permeability and contrast enhancement, radiographic response does not reliably reflect true changes in tumor burden, limiting the interpretability of ORR in this setting,” Kotecha told Medscape Medical News.

“Despite this limitation, the findings reinforce the feasibility of hypofractionated reirradiation regimens (3-5 fractions) for well-selected patients, consistent with forthcoming consensus guidelines from the International Stereotactic Radiosurgery Society (ISRS). Future investigations should incorporate advanced imaging biomarkers to better delineate biologically active tumor regions and enable higher-precision targeting, particularly when using more hypofractionated approaches,” Kotecha said.

Both Liu and Kotecha reported having no relevant disclosures.

NEWPORT, Wales — Compassion has its limits and doctors need care too, experts warned at a well-being session at the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Annual Conference 2025.

Presenters Dr Roopinder Brar, medical adviser and GP in Woking, Surrey, and Kay Louise Grant, risk adviser at the Medical and Dental Defence Union of Scotland (MDDUS), shared alarming survey data. The figures showed that 60% of healthcare professionals have experienced compassion fatigue, 66% reported burnout, and 74% have considered leaving or retiring early.

Alarmingly, 1 in 5 (19%) admitted to having thoughts of self-harm or suicide during their career.

Michael Blackmore, a GP partner at NHS Forth Valley, Grangemouth, Scotland, and chair of the RCGP West Scotland Faculty, moderated the session.

“Compassion fatigue does not mean burnout; it means emotional depletion, which is an empty cup when, in fact, you need a full one to care for others,” he told Medscape News UK afterward.

Coined by Carla Joinson in 1992, compassion fatigue describes “a loss of the ability to nurture.”

Warning signs include detachment, irritability, self-criticism, and cynicism. Risk factors include high work-stress, low support, and negative coping mechanisms.

﻿﻿Brar provided context through two anonymised GP vignettes — “Dr M” and “Dr P” — illustrating emotional depletion in practice.

Dr M is an eight-session GP partner. He works 8.00 AM to 6.30 AM most days, and often later on call days. He frequently skips lunch, checks emails on days off, and feels guilty saying no. Every task feels urgent to Dr M, and with GPs constantly told how resilient they are, Dr M feels unable to share that the workload is unmanageable and does not want to let anyone down.

Turning to the second case study, Dr P is a salaried GP with two small children. She describes being perpetually late, feels guilty about limited sessions, and never has downtime. She is known to be a perfectionist, so she often stays late, checks emails on days off, and logs in to get ahead of her next day. Dr P feels there is pressure to get everything done and no one wants to wait anymore. She is also annoyed and irritated all the time. Dr P says she feels like a pressure cooker about to explode.

Blackmore, who oversees GP recruitment and retention in Scotland, told Medscape News UK that compassion fatigue is compounded by “unrealistic” public and media expectations.

“There's a sense of entitlement among patients with people believing this is how the NHS should work, and if it doesn't, they get upset,” he said. “We're the front-facing part of the NHS, so we get the complaints about secondary care, about things that aren't even within our control.”

He argued that continuity of care could ease some of the strain.

“If patients saw the same doctor more consistently, you could communicate better and build trust. You'd spend less time going over the same history and more on a meaningful management plan.”

Blackmore asserted that investment was the root solution.

“In Scotland, we have around 1700 patients per doctor — ideally that should be closer to 1000. For every pound spent on general practice, £14 is saved in the wider system.”

Despite government pledges, hospital consultant numbers have risen far more than GPs, he noted. In England, the NHS Long Term Workforce Plan projects a 49% increase in hospital consultants over a decade compared with only 4% for GPs.

He pointed out that since 90% of NHS consultations happen in general practice, “that imbalance is unsustainable.”

Communication breakdown often escalates compassion fatigue, added Blackmore.

“We all learn communication skills at medical school, but there's little training after this or in mid-career, when pressures are greatest.”

Patients often hear only fragments of what doctors say, especially when emotions run high.

“Different patients prefer different communication styles. Some want directness; others need more sensitivity. But when you're exhausted, it's harder to get that balance right.”

Short appointment times magnify the challenge.

“We have 10 minutes to review notes, take a history, discuss management, and safety-net. It's impossible,” said Blackmore. “When we overrun, we feel pressured to say the right thing quickly, and sometimes it comes out wrong. But we're human, and when that happens, we apologise.”

Blackmore, who also works in addiction medicine, said funding for specialist GP training is crucial. “If we could upskill GPs to manage more specialisms in the community, patients wouldn't need to travel miles to hospital clinics. It would save time, money, and improve outcomes.”

Brar and Grant closed with evidence-based tools to help clinicians “protect the cup.”

These included recognising the difference between compassion and empathy — the former being active and having boundaries, the latter potentially depleting.

They also suggested using cognitive-behavioural therapy to challenge unhelpful thoughts, and acceptance and commitment therapy to stay aligned with values during discomfort.

Mindfulness, breathing techniques, and peer-to-peer reflection were also encouraged.

Blackmore declared no relevant financial disclosures. Brar and Grant declared no relevant financial disclosures other than representing MDDUS. The session was sponsored by MDDUS.

Researchers have discovered that the ability to have an erection or to orgasm is related to the levels of serotonin in the brain, but this relation only applies to depressed patients taking SSRI antidepressants. At the moment, there is no test for who might experience sexual problems during treatment for depression, but this discovery may help depressed patients to choose antidepressants which allow them to maintain or regain an active sex life when treated with antidepressants. This work is presented at the ECNP conference in Amsterdam.

Sexual dysfunction is a common symptom of depression. SSRI antidepressants can help sexual dysfunction by improving mood, but at the same time SSRIs themselves are often associated with sexual side-effects. Unfortunately, there's no way of predicting these side effects in advance. Difficulty reaching orgasm is a common side effect, as are reduced desire and difficulty maintaining an erection. These side effects can affect up to 70% of patients taking SSRI medications, such as Prozac and escitalopram. These effects can be distressing, often leading to people stopping treatment.

The Copenhagen-based researchers studied 90 people who had been diagnosed with depression. They measured brain serotonin activity using a special EEG test called LDAEP (Loudness Dependence of Auditory Evoked Potentials), which is like a hearing test that reveals how your brain processes sound; perhaps surprisingly, this also tells us about serotonin levels in the brain - the lower the LDAEP, the higher the serotonin activity.

The patients then started an 8-week course of SSRI antidepressants, with the researchers carefully tracking any sexual side effects that developed. This allowed the researchers to see if they could predict who would have sexual problems based on their pretreatment LDAEP measurement.

Lead researcher Dr Kristian Jensen (from Copenhagen University Hospital) said:

""We discovered that people with higher serotonin activity before treatment started were much more likely to develop sexual side effects by the end of the 8-week antidepressant course, especially difficulty reaching orgasm. Using this non-invasive brain measure combined with information about sexual problems related to their depression, we could predict the ability to reach orgasm with 87% accuracy. We need a bigger study, with more men, to get an accurate figure for erectile dysfunction"".

He continued:

""Currently, patients only discover sexual side effects after they've already started antidepressant medication. Measuring serotonin activity via the LDAEP test at the start of the course of antidepressants allows us to predict the likelihood of later sexual problems due to the SSRI. If confirmed, our findings could enable a more precise approach to depression treatment, helping doctors select medications to minimise sexual side effects in those patients most likely to develop SSRI-related problems. This could help treatment adherence and overall quality of life and generally give better treatment options for depression.

Our findings seem only to apply to medication-induced sexual problems, so it's not a general test for sexual difficulties. However, we are now looking to refine this, we have a 600-patient study underway which will look at how serotonin levels combined with sex hormones levels affect sexual function during depression and medication"".

Commenting, Professor Eric Ruhe, Professor in Difficult-to-Treat Depression at Radboudumc, Nijmegen, the Netherlands said:

""This is a very interesting study where the researchers innovatively use an easy-to-administer test to predict the chance of sexual dysfunction after the start of antidepressant. When replicated, this type of test might reliably help to know beforehand whether a patient will have sexual adverse effects or not. As many patients experience sexual dysfunction after the start of SSRI antidepressants (like escitalopram), the most important clinical application will be to predict that sexual dysfunction will not occur, especially in patients who worry about that adverse effect and are hesitant to initiate treatment. 

I also encourage the researchers to expand their efforts towards developing a tool that can advise which drug to take instead, without just relying on current pharmacological considerations"".

Professor Ruhe was not involved in this work; this is an independent comment.

This work is currently under peer-review. The researchers note that the subjects in the study were comparatively young (average age 27) and mostly (73%) female, so they are now aiming to replicate the study in a much bigger group of 600 patients.

Dr Kristian Jensen said ""The LDAEP itself is quite elegant: we play sounds at different volumes through headphones while measuring brain waves. It takes about 30 minutes and is non-invasive. It's not generally available at the moment, but that may change if this test lives up to expectations"".

Overdose deaths in adults age 65 and older from fentanyl mixed with stimulants, such as cocaine and methamphetamines, have surged 9,000% in the past eight years, matching rates found among younger adults, according to research presented at the ANESTHESIOLOGY® 2025 annual meeting.

The study is among the first to use Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data to show that older adults, a group often overlooked in overdose research, are part of the broader rise in fentanyl-stimulant overdose deaths. Adults 65 years and older are especially vulnerable to overdoses because many live with chronic health conditions, take several medications and process drugs more slowly due to age. 

The opioid epidemic has unfolded in four waves, each characterized by a different type of opioid driving the increase in overdose deaths: prescription opioids in the 1990s; heroin starting in 2010; fentanyl starting in 2013; and a mix of fentanyl and stimulants starting in 2015.

A common misconception is that opioid overdoses primarily affect younger people. Our analysis shows that older adults are also impacted by fentanyl-related deaths and that stimulant involvement has become much more common in this group. This suggests older adults are affected by the current fourth wave of the opioid crisis, following similar patterns seen in younger populations.""

Gab Pasia, M.A., lead author of the study and medical student at the University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine

Researchers analyzed 404,964 death certificates that listed fentanyl as a cause of death from 1999 to 2023, obtained from the CDC Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) system. Older adults (age 65+) represented 17,040 and younger adults (ages 25–64) represented 387,924 of the death certificates.

Overall, fentanyl-related deaths between 2015 and 2023 increased from 264 to 4,144 in older adults (1,470% increase) and 8,513 to 64,694 in younger adults (660% increase). The analysis revealed a growing number of fentanyl-stimulant related deaths, particularly among adults age 65 or older. Among this group, fentanyl-stimulant deaths rose from 8.7% (23 of 264 fentanyl deaths) in 2015 to 49.9% (2,070 of 4,144 fentanyl deaths) in 2023, a 9,000% increase. For younger adults, fentanyl-stimulant deaths increased from 21.3% (1,812 of 8,513 fentanyl deaths) in 2015 to 59.3% (38,333 of 64,694 fentanyl deaths) in 2023, a 2,115% increase.

The researchers highlighted data from these individual years because 2015 marked the onset of the fourth wave of the opioid epidemic and was also the year fentanyl-stimulant deaths among older adults were at their lowest, and 2023 as it was the most recent year of CDC data available.

The researchers noted that the rise in fentanyl deaths involving stimulants in older adults began to sharply rise in 2020, while deaths linked to other substances stayed the same or declined. Cocaine and methamphetamines were the most common stimulants paired with fentanyl among the older adults studied, surpassing alcohol, heroin and benzodiazepines such as Xanax and Valium.

""National data have shown rising fentanyl-stimulant use among all adults,"" said Mr. Pasia. ""Because our analysis was a national, cross-sectional study, we were only able to describe patterns over time - not determine the underlying reasons why they are occurring. However, the findings underscore that fentanyl overdoses in older adults are often multi-substance deaths - not due to fentanyl alone - and the importance of sharing drug misuse prevention strategies to older patients.""

The authors noted anesthesiologists and other pain medicine specialists should:

""Older adults who are prescribed opioids, or their caregivers, should ask their clinicians about overdose prevention strategies, such as having naloxone available and knowing the signs of an overdose,"" said Richard Wang, M.D., an anesthesiology resident at Rush University Medical Center, Chicago and co-author of the study. ""With these trends in mind, it is more important than ever to minimize opioid use in this vulnerable group and use other pain control methods when appropriate. Proper patient education and regularly reviewing medication lists could help to flatten this terrible trend.""

NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease, N-ERD, is associated with measurable changes in concentrations of lipid mediators involved in inflammation and pain modulation, a new study shows. Plasma concentrations of two key endocannabinoid-related lipids, arachidonoylethanolamide (AEA) and oleoylethanolamide (OEA), were significantly reduced in patients with N-ERD, compared to healthy controls.

In addition, even a very low dose of aspirin increased AEA and OEA levels in controls, but not in N-ERD patients. The study, conducted in collaboration between the University of Eastern Finland, the University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, was published in Clinical & Experimental Allergy.

N-ERD is a chronic syndrome in which nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, provoke asthma attacks and other respiratory symptoms. Patients typically suffer from severe asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and the condition significantly impairs quality of life. Currently, there is no clinical laboratory test for N-ERD, and diagnosis requires a costly and risky aspirin challenge performed in a hospital setting. The disease mechanisms remain poorly understood, and optimal treatment strategies are still lacking.

This present study is the first to report changes in endocannabinoid signaling in patients with N-ERD, which may help explain chronic inflammation and heightened perception of pain associated with the condition. In addition to reduced concentrations of AEA and OEA, elevated concentrations of leukotriene E4 and other lipid mediators were also observed, possibly reflecting N-ERD associated inflammation.

These changes in lipid metabolism, which affect the endocannabinoid system, may in the future open up new avenues for diagnosing N-ERD, and for developing targeted therapies."" 

Viljami Salmi, Doctoral Researcher, University of Helsinki

Further research involving larger patient cohorts is needed. The present study included eight individuals diagnosed with N-ERD and seven healthy controls.

Owlstone Medical (""Owlstone""), the global leader in Breath Biopsy® for applications in early disease detection and precision medicine, today announced that it has won an award of up to $49.1 million from the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) for the Platform Optimizing SynBio for Early Intervention and Detection in Oncology (POSEIDON) program. POSEIDON aims to develop first-in-class synthetic-sensor based Multi-Cancer-Early Detection (MCED) tests for Stage I detection of 30+ solid tumors using only breath and urine samples that can be performed in the home and are available over the counter.

Almost 40 % of Americans will develop cancer in their lifetimes and cancer is the second leading cause of death in the U.S. The number of new cancer diagnoses in 2025 is estimated to be more than 2 million, with over 618,000 cancer deaths, equivalent to almost 1,700 deaths every day. The patient-related economic burden of cancer in 2019 was more than $21 billion in the U.S., of which treatment costs are by far the largest component. Critically, costs associated with late-stage diagnoses are much higher than early-stage, however cancer is difficult to detect early when it is most curable.

Drastically reducing late-stage diagnoses by detecting cancer at Stage I would not only increase treatment effectiveness, but also significantly reduce cancer care costs, restoring up to $2.3 trillion to the U.S. economy. Currently available screening technologies are unable to address this need due to performance limitations, and many Americans are too remote to access clinic and hospital-based screening programs. While emerging technologies such as liquid biopsy hold great promise for later stage cancer detection and to help guide therapy selection, performance in early-stage cancer detection has been insufficient.

Owlstone's project, in partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston University, Georgia Tech Research Corporation, Qurin B.V., and Planned Systems International Inc, aims to overcome this challenge by delivering accurate, low-cost cancer screening for 30+ solid tumors to Americans aged 18 and older.

The project involves the inhalation of a mix of pan-cancer and tumor-specific synthetic sensors from a single-use inhaler, which then circulate throughout the body and accumulate on the surface of cancer cells. The reporters produced by the sensors are either DNA-based which act as a readable barcode, or a set of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), supporting the detection of 36 cancers in total. These will be collected at-home or in clinic in urine samples and from breath respectively using portable collection and analysis devices. Results will be uploadable real-time to electronic health records (EHR) for rapid review by healthcare professionals, integrating seamlessly into clinical practice and digitally enabled care.

This unique approach offers significant advantages over competing technologies. These include boosting the signal to enhance test performance such that cancer is reliably detectable from early stage, enabling simple and non-invasive sample collection at home, rapid result generation and EHR integration, and a low-cost manufacturing model such that economics are not a barrier to adoption of the technology as the new standard of care for early cancer detection.

""The field of cancer screening needs a revolution, and POSEIDON stands ready to deliver. The program allows for a better future by creating broadly accessible, at-home tests that will accurately detect 30+ cancers as early as Stage I, when tumors are still small and the chances of survival are high,"" said POSEIDON Program Manager Ross Uhrich, DMD, MBA. ""This revolutionary funding effort brings together experts in synthetic biology, oncology, medical devices, big cancer data, and commercialization to create test kits that will transform how and when people are screened for cancer. POSEIDON will allow every American the opportunity to test themselves long before they have symptoms and at their discretion. POSEIDON's rigorous performance metrics and translational focus reflect our clear commitment to bring these technologies safely and directly to all Americans.""

Access to an accurate and low-cost MCED test that does not require a doctor's visit or laboratory testing is key to preventing late-stage diagnoses. This award validates both breath as a diagnostic approach and Owlstone's EVOC® probes as a reporter technology to overcome the shortcomings and challenges that have held back early cancer detection previously. We are grateful to ARPA-H for the opportunity to bring transformative MCED testing to every American within the next decade.""

By confirming cognitive impairment before ordering amyloid blood tests, this two-step approach cuts false positives, streamlines referrals, and moves Alzheimer's diagnosis closer to everyday clinics.



Study: Primary care detection of Alzheimer's disease using a self-administered digital cognitive test and blood biomarkers. Image Credit: Orawan Pattarawimonchai / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Nature Medicine, researchers in Sweden and the United States assessed whether a brief self-administered digital cognitive battery, alone or combined with a blood-based amyloid biomarker panel, more accurately detects cognitive impairment and clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) in primary care than standard care.

One in every three older adults worries about memory loss, yet many never receive a timely, accurate diagnosis. AD is the leading cause of dementia, driven by amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition, tau aggregation, and neurodegeneration. Early stages like subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) often slip past brief paper tests such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), especially in rushed clinics. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) can confirm pathology, but these methods are invasive, costly, or scarce. Blood tests like phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) are promising, yet pretest probabilities vary widely in primary care, with amyloid positivity generally lower in SCD and higher in MCI or dementia, influencing positive predictive value (PPV). International guidance increasingly emphasizes two-step workflows that confirm impairment before biomarker testing. Further research should validate efficient, accurate, and scalable frontline pathways.

The investigators trained and validated BioCog, a tablet-based, self-administered test battery, across two Swedish cohorts. A secondary-care cohort from the BioFINDER-2 study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03174938) was used to build logistic-regression models and establish cutoffs; an independent primary-care cohort from 19 clinics in the BioFINDER-Primary Care study (NCT06120361) served for external validation. BioCog included a ten-word list (three immediate recalls, delayed recall, and delayed recognition), a cognitive processing-speed task, and items related to orientation to time. Objective cognitive impairment was defined using the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS); in secondary care, a proxy for the RBANS from similar neuropsychological tests was used.

Model selection employed recursive feature elimination with Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and receiver-operating-characteristic area under the curve (AUC) for performance. One-cutoff and two-cutoff schemes were predefined; the latter created an intermediate zone to be resolved by further evaluation. Two BioCog probability thresholds (0.332 and 0.769) were chosen to target 95% sensitivity and 95% specificity. Primary-care physicians (PCPs) performed standard evaluations, including MMSE, MoCA, computed tomography, and clinical judgment. A two-step workflow was tested: Step 1 involved BioCog to detect impairment; Step 2 involved a plasma panel (PrecivityAD2) generating the Amyloid Probability Score-2 (APS2) from Aβ42, Aβ40, p-tau217, and non-p-tau217. Sensitivity analyses used the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) global score ≥0.5 as an alternative impairment reference.



Comparing a digital testing and blood biomarker-based diagnostic workflow to the current standard clinical evaluation in the primary care cohort. Comparisons were made on a subset of individuals with all existing data available (n = 365; see Supplementary Table 17 for detailed population characteristics). a. Our proposed primary care two-step workflow consists of step 1, the detection of cognitive impairment using the BioCog, followed by step 2, a blood biomarker assessment to evaluate whether AD pathology is present in cognitively impaired individuals. b, Evaluation of the workflow using our BioCog6 model for step 1 and the plasma biomarker APS2 for step 2 (green). The workflow was compared against a standard clinical evaluation by PCPs in which the physician assesses both whether the patient had cognitive impairment (MCI or dementia) and whether the impairment was caused by AD (without any biomarkers) (PCPAD, orange), and against a workflow using only the plasma biomarker APS2 without any cognitive assessment (red). Error bars indicate 95% CI, with the center point corresponding to the mean value. Credit: Images in a adapted from NIAID NIH BIOART (https://bioart.niaid.nih.gov). 

In secondary care (n=223; mean age 73 years), the best six-variable model (BioCog6: delayed recall, processing-speed correct, immediate recall performance, total time, age, and delayed recognition) achieved an AUC of 0.96 and 89% accuracy for objectively verified cognitive impairment at a single cutoff. A two-cutoff approach reached 96% accuracy with 18% of participants in an intermediate zone requiring follow-up. Psychometrics supported feasibility and validity: strong convergent correlations with paper analogs, weak divergent correlations with unrelated domains, an average completion time of about 11 minutes, and only around 2% reporting difficulty with instructions.

External validation in primary care (n=403; mean age 77 years) showed BioCog6 AUC 0.93 and 85% accuracy (positive predictive value [PPV] 87%, negative predictive value [NPV] 83%, sensitivity 88%, specificity 82%) using one cutoff, significantly outperforming PCP assessment (accuracy 73%) based on usual testing and imaging. With two cutoffs carried over from training, accuracy rose to 90% (PPV 91%, NPV 89%) with an 18% intermediate group. Head-to-head comparisons favored BioCog6 over MMSE, MoCA, Mini-Cog, and the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) paired-associates learning, both in one-cutoff analyses and, where available, two-cutoff analyses, even after demographic adjustments.

Critically, the two-step workflow tailored for primary care, BioCog first, then blood testing only for those objectively impaired, identified biomarker-verified clinical AD (impairment due to AD by expert consensus with CSF or Aβ-PET support) with 90% accuracy (PPV 83%, NPV 93%, specificity 92%, sensitivity 84%). This surpassed PCP-only pathways (accuracy 70%) and outperformed blood testing alone (accuracy 80%), which showed an approximate 17% false-positive rate when used without an impairment filter. Using two cutoffs for both BioCog and APS2 raised accuracy to 95% with a larger intermediate zone (about 30%), emphasizing a trade-off between certainty and indeterminate referrals. Findings were accurate when substituting CDR ≥0.5 for RBANS (primary metrics dipped modestly but remained high) and when removing age from the BioCog model.

Interpretation centers on pretest probability: because only individuals with cognitive impairment (not SCD) are eligible for recently implemented Aβ-targeting immunotherapies, an efficient front-end filter that confirms impairment before blood biomarkers reduces false positives, improves PPV, and aligns with international recommendations and the World Health Organization's preferred product profile for blood tests. Digital delivery standardizes administration, captures timing features beyond raw scores, and minimizes personnel time, advantages for busy clinics facing growing demand. However, the authors caution that BioCog must complement, not replace, clinical judgment and that validation in other languages, cultures, and longitudinal settings is still required.

This proof-of-concept demonstrates that a brief, self-administered digital cognitive battery can accurately identify objective cognitive impairment in primary care. When followed by a targeted blood-biomarker panel, it can diagnose clinical AD with substantially higher accuracy than the current standard-of-care. The stepwise “test-then-blood” approach enhances diagnostic certainty, reduces inappropriate referrals, and prioritizes candidates for Aβ-targeting therapies. While generalizability beyond Swedish settings and longitudinal utility need further study, the pathway is practical, scalable, and consistent with international guidance: confirm impairment first, then use blood biomarkers to infer amyloid pathology, bringing earlier, more confident diagnoses within reach of routine clinics.

INTEGRA Biosciences' SWITCH hybrid pipette has been scientifically evaluated for ergonomics through an in-depth collaboration with the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW). The SWITCH combines the tactile control of manual pipetting with the intelligent repeat dispense function of an electronic system, offering laboratories a new standard in comfort, precision and efficiency.

The SWITCH can be operated manually for a familiar handheld pipetting experience, or switched to repeat dispense mode for efficient electronic aliquoting.

Pipetting can be one of the most physically demanding tasks in a lab. Daily routines may involve thousands of repetitive thumb and wrist motions, sustained muscle loading and awkward postures, all of which increase the risk of injuries such as tendonitis, carpal tunnel syndrome and shoulder pain. ZHAW evaluated pipetting from a biomechanics perspective, and identified the ergonomic parameters most critical to protecting users from these risks. INTEGRA applied these insights directly to the SWITCH, ensuring its design meets or exceeds the highest standards for safe pipetting.

Every aspect has been designed to reduce strain during repetitive tasks, from optimized handle dimensions to a tapered shape that supports neutral wrist alignment, as well as a consistent plunger height that keeps the thumb relaxed across all volumes. The SWITCH also weighs around 130 g, which is well below the grip force capabilities of both men and women, helping to minimize shoulder and arm fatigue during extended use. The SWITCH has been compared to leading manual and electronic models in a series of internal studies, confirming its superior performance for plunger force, handle comfort and task efficiency.

Global mortality rates are falling but not among youths and young adults, according to the latest Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study published in The Lancet today and presented at the World Health Summit in Berlin. Additionally, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) now account for nearly two-thirds of the world's total mortality and morbidity, with ischemic heart disease, stroke, and diabetes leading the globe. Researchers also estimate that nearly half of all death and disability could be prevented by modifying some of the leading risk factors, such as reducing high levels of blood sugar and high body mass index (BMI).

""The rapid growth in the world's aging population and evolving risk factors have ushered in a new era of global health challenges,"" said Dr. Christopher Murray, Director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington School of Medicine. ""The evidence presented in the Global Burden of Disease study is a wake-up call, urging government and health care leaders to respond swiftly and strategically to the disturbing trends that are reshaping public health needs.""

Dr. Murray's team at IHME and its GBD Collaborator Network of 16,500 scientists and researchers collected and analyzed data and produced estimates for 375 diseases and injuries and 88 risk factors by age and sex globally, regionally, and nationally for 204 countries and territories and 660 subnational locations from 1990 to 2023, making the GBD the most comprehensive research quantifying health loss. Over 310,000 total data sources were used for the latest iteration, 30% of them new to this year's study. It includes 1,211 location-years of provisional all-age vital registration data, which had not previously been used, and which provide more timely information. The global health assessments outlined in three peer-reviewed capstones cover critical areas of the GBD: a demographic analysis, causes of death, and the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors.

Despite population growth and aging, the 2023 global age-standardized mortality rate declined 67% since 1950, and all countries and territories marked declines. Global life expectancy returned to pre-pandemic levels at 76.3 years for females and 71.5 years for males, which is more than 20 years higher compared to 1950. Despite this progress, stark geographic differences remain, with life expectancy ranging from as high as 83 years in high-income regions to as low as 62 years in sub-Saharan Africa.

Among adolescents and young adults, the largest increase in deaths was registered among those aged 20 to 39 in high-income North America from 2011 to 2023, mainly due to suicide, drug overdose, and high quantities of alcohol. During the same period, deaths in the 5–19-year age group increased in Eastern Europe, high-income North America, and the Caribbean.

Over the entire study period, the number of infant deaths declined more than for any other age group. From 2011 to 2023, East Asia recorded the largest decrease of 68% in the mortality rate for the under-5 age group due to better nutrition, vaccines, and stronger health systems.

Advances in modeling for the GBD 2023 study showed mortality in children ages 5–14 in sub-Saharan Africa from 1950 to 2021 was higher than previously estimated, an increase driven by high rates of respiratory infections and tuberculosis, other infectious diseases, and unintentional injuries. New calculations also showed mortality in young adult females ages 15–29 in sub-Saharan Africa was 61% higher than previously estimated, mostly due to maternal mortality, road injuries, and meningitis. Read the capstone on the demographic changes in global health.

Causes of death are shifting from infectious to non-communicable diseases (NCDs), creating new global health challenges, particularly for low-income countries. After standing as the leading cause of death in 2021, COVID-19 plunged to the 20th place in 2023, putting ischemic heart disease and stroke back at the top, followed by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower respiratory infections, and neonatal disorders. Since 1990, mortality rates for ischemic heart disease and stroke have declined, and so have diarrheal diseases, tuberculosis, stomach cancer, and measles. Conversely, during the same period the death rate increased for diabetes, chronic kidney disease, Alzheimer's disease, and HIV/AIDS.

While the global mean age at death increased from 46.4 in 1990 to 62.9 years in 2023, geographic inequities were profound. The highest mean age of death was recorded in the high-income super-region, with females reaching 80.5 years and males at 74.4 years. The lowest mean age of death was in sub-Saharan Africa, with females at 37.1 years and males at 34.8 years.

The all-cause probability of dying before age 70 decreased across each GBD super-region and region from 2000 to 2023, with drug use disorders as one of the leading causes. In sub-Saharan Africa, the probability increased for many NCDs, and the mean age of death from NCDs was lower than expected. In the high-income super-region, the probability increased for drug use disorders, and the mean age of death was lower than expected. 

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) accounted for nearly two-thirds of the world's total death and disability. The top three causes were ischemic heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Low-income regions also saw a sharp rise in NCDs, further constraining nations with limited resources.

From 1990 to 2023, the age-standardized rate of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) fell 36%. This measures total years of healthy life lost by examining the years lost from premature death and years lived with disability. From 2010 to 2023, DALY rates for communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases fell by almost 26%. This was led by rates for diarrheal diseases being cut in half, a 43% decrease in rates for HIV/AIDS, and a 42% drop for tuberculosis. Neonatal disorders and lower respiratory infections remain the top causes of CMNN diseases but have declined 17% and 25%, respectively.

Almost half of the global mortality and morbidity in 2023 was attributable to 88 modifiable risk factors. The 10 risk factors with the highest proportion of health loss were high systolic blood pressure, particulate matter pollution, smoking, high fasting plasma glucose, low birthweight and short gestation, high BMI, high LDL cholesterol, kidney dysfunction, child growth failure, and lead exposure. Between 2010 and 2023, DALY rates for high BMI rose by almost 11%, drug use by nearly 9%, and high blood sugar by 6%.

New GBD modeling methods for lead exposure, the 10th-leading risk, also revealed a direct link to cardiovascular diseases. Removing lead from fuel has contributed to substantial declines in exposure over the years, but it's still a common environmental contaminant that can be found in paint in older buildings, contaminated soil, water, spices, and many cooking utensils.

Climate-sensitive risks, such as air pollution and heat, continue to have a more significant impact on global health. The DALY rates for the second-leading risk, particulate matter pollution, were highest at the super-region level in South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and North Africa and the Middle East. High temperatures are also exacerbating vulnerabilities in that same region, particularly the Sahel, by compounding the effects of drought, food insecurity, and displacement.

Mental health disorders rose steeply, with anxiety disorders increasing by 63% and depressive disorders by 26%. In addition, sexual abuse and intimate partner violence were identified as preventable contributors to depression, anxiety, and other health consequences.

Among children under 5, the 2023 leading risk factors were child and maternal malnutrition, particulate matter pollution, and unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH). For children and adolescents aged 5 to 14 years, iron deficiency was the leading risk, followed by others related to unsafe WaSH and child and maternal malnutrition. For the 15 to 49 age group, the top two risks were unsafe sex and occupational injuries, followed by high BMI, high systolic blood pressure, and smoking. For those 50 to 69 years, high systolic blood pressure was the leading risk, followed by smoking, high blood sugar, high BMI, high LDL cholesterol, and kidney dysfunction.

From 2010 to 2023, injury-related DALY rates decreased by 16% during the same time period. The burden of injuries was higher in males, particularly older children and young adults ages 10 to 24, accounting for more than double the total DALYs compared to that of females.

The GBD 2023 study highlights the urgent need for policymakers to expand health priorities beyond reducing child mortality to include adolescents and young adults, particularly in areas with higher rates of mortality than previously known.

Decades of work to close the gap in low-income regions with persistent health inequities are in danger of unraveling due to the recent cuts to international aid. These countries rely on global health funding for life-saving primary care, medicine, and vaccines. Without it, the gap is sure to widen.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Food insecurity and loneliness linked to higher risk of chronic pain after surgery","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251013/Food-insecurity-and-loneliness-linked-to-higher-risk-of-chronic-pain-after-surgery.aspx","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 05:15:00 GMT","

People who experience food insecurity or loneliness are much more likely to develop chronic pain after surgery, according to new research presented at the ANESTHESIOLOGY® 2025 annual meeting.

Chronic pain - lasting three months or longer - after surgery is common, especially after major procedures such as hip or knee replacement, and affects up to 30%-50% of surgical patients. Social factors such as food insecurity and social isolation can significantly raise this risk, the authors found.

Limited access to nutritious food can slow wound healing and increase inflammation, making pain more likely to last longer. Stress from loneliness can overstimulate the nervous system and make pain feel more severe. Also, a lack of social support can leave patients without help with tasks such as picking up medication or attending physical therapy, which can increase recovery time and the likelihood of pain becoming long-term. 

Our study provides strong evidence that a person's social situation may be just as important as their physical health when it comes to recovery. People who lack basic needs such as food and social connection may face a higher risk of long-term pain after surgery. But patients with strong support systems - whether from family, friends or community resources - are better protected. These findings highlight the importance for health care professionals to look beyond traditional medicine and consider the whole picture of a patient's life, from their dinner table to their support system, to help aid recovery.""

Louie Rodriguez, M.D., co-author of the study and physician research scholar, University of California, San Diego

Researchers analyzed the data from a National Institutes of Health database of 8,065 patients who had surgery after 2000, had no history of chronic pain before surgery, and completed survey data from any of the 78 social determinants of health questions available in the database. Overall, 641 patients (7.9%) developed chronic pain after surgery, which was defined as having persistent postoperative pain at least one year after surgery.

Food insecurity was the strongest predictor of chronic pain, with affected patients being 83% more likely to develop it, compared to those who had reliable access to food. Other predictors included loneliness and level of social support, measured through eight of the 78 survey questions that asked patients to rate their experiences on a scale of 1 to 4.

For the questions related to loneliness, each additional point on the scale increased the risk of chronic pain after surgery by 2.1%. For the questions related to the level of social support, each additional point (reflecting stronger social support) reduced the risk by 3.7%.

""Patients should know that being open about their social and financial situation may be a crucial part of their recovery success after surgery,"" said Rodney Grabriel, M.D., MAS, co-author of the study and associate professor of anesthesiology at the University of California, San Diego. ""They should feel empowered to discuss any concerns about food insecurity or a lack of social support with their doctors and nurses, who can help connect them to resources like food assistance programs or support groups, which may make recovery faster and lower their risk of ongoing pain.""

The researchers added that screening patients for these and other social factors before surgery can help clinicians intervene early and personalize pain management strategies. Integrating these factors into care plans can be key steps to improving recovery and reducing the risk of chronic pain for vulnerable patients.

Most children - including nearly 80% of infants - go without clear liquids before surgery for at least twice as long as guidelines recommend, according to an analysis of data on more than 70,000 children presented at the ANESTHESIOLOGY® 2025 annual meeting.

Healthy infants and children may safely drink clear liquids, including water, fruit juices without pulp and carbohydrate-containing beverages, until two hours before receiving anesthesia, according to guidelines from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA). The guidelines recommend that children not drink anything within two hours before the procedure to reduce the risk of liquid entering the lungs, which could cause choking or pneumonia. However, fasting longer can be harmful because it may cause dehydration, as well as unhealthy changes in blood sugar and other chemicals in the body.

Prolonged fasting from clear liquids of four hours or longer can be uncomfortable and increase thirst, anxiety, pain, nausea and vomiting. It can be harmful too. Children and infants are especially vulnerable to dehydration and calorie loss, which may heighten stress and slow recovery from surgery.""

Alexander Nagrebetsky, M.D., M.Sc., senior author of the study and anesthesiologist and intensivist at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, Massachusetts

Researchers reviewed records from 71,835 children, aged 17 or younger (3,771 of whom were infants younger than 1 year old), who had elective surgery at one of 12 U.S. hospitals between 2016 and 2024. In the study, prolonged fasting was defined as fasting from clear liquids for four hours (or longer) before surgery, which is two times longer (or more) than guidelines recommend.

Overall, the proportion of children who fasted from clear liquids for at least two times longer than recommended before surgery decreased from 84.3% in 2016 to 70.2% in 2024, but increased in infants, from 75.9% in 2016 to 79.6% in 2024.

The median length of time all children fasted from clear liquids decreased overall from 10.9 hours in 2016 to 8.7 hours in 2024. However, there was no significant improvement in infants, who fasted a median of 6.7 hours in 2016 and 6.3 hours in 2024. In 2024 alone, the median duration of clear liquid fasting was three times longer than the recommendation in infants and four times longer in all children.

While the study didn't address why parents and health care professionals withheld clear liquids from children for longer than recommended, there are likely several reasons: parents and physicians may be following outdated practices of prolonged fasting (e.g., nothing to drink after midnight); lack of awareness of ASA fasting guidelines that note ""efforts should be made to allow clear liquids in healthy children as close to two hours before the procedure as possible;"" and a lack of understanding that prolonged fasting can increase complications and negatively impact recovery.

Perioperative team members should encourage patients to drink water and liquids with sugar for up to two hours before the procedure when appropriate, said Dr. Nagrebetsky. Parents should advocate for their children and ask their anesthesiologist about current recommendations for clear liquids before the procedure, he said.

""The study confirmed our hypothesis that non-adherence to ASA fasting guidelines is common in the U.S.,"" said Ethan Lowder, B.A., lead study author and a student at Harvard Medical School. ""Drinking sugar-containing clear liquids such as juices or those with electrolytes provides water and calories that children's bodies need for normal functioning, including dealing with the stress of surgery and recovery.""

New mothers are more likely to experience severe pain that disrupts sleep and activities of daily living, as well as develop sleep disorders, if they give birth by cesarean delivery (C-section), suggests research presented at the ANESTHESIOLOGY® 2025 annual meeting.

Sleep is often overlooked in postpartum recovery, but it is central to a mother's physical and mental health. Cesarean delivery in particular appears to increase the risk for severe pain and sleep disorders, which can lead to postpartum depression, thinking and memory problems, and fatigue, as well as disrupt bonding with their babies and relationships with family and friends.""

Moe Takenoshita, M.B.B.Ch., lead author of the study and postdoctoral scholar, department of anesthesia, Stanford University Center for Academic Medicine, Palo Alto, California

The study included both qualitative and quantitative analyses. For the qualitative analysis, the authors interviewed 41 mothers about their pain and sleep experiences after childbirth, 24 of whom had vaginal births, 11 who had scheduled C-sections and six whose C-sections were unplanned. More than two-thirds of the mothers who had C-sections (73% of the scheduled cesareans and 67% of the unplanned) reported severe pain that disrupted sleep and activities of daily living, compared to 8% of those who had vaginal births.

For the quantitative study, the authors analyzed a nationwide insurance database of more than 1.5 million mothers who delivered babies between 2008 and 2021. They determined that individuals who have C-sections are 16% more likely to be diagnosed with a new sleep disorder (e.g., insomnia, sleep deprivation or obstructive sleep apnea) between a month and a year after giving birth, compared to those who delivered vaginally.

New mothers, especially those recovering from C-sections, should be sure to manage pain adequately, since untreated pain can worsen sleep, said Dr. Takenoshita. Other measures that can help to improve sleep include regular exercise as appropriate, sleeping when the baby sleeps, avoiding caffeine or alcohol late in the day, and relaxing before bed by taking a bath or practicing deep breathing.

""About one-third of U.S. births are C-sections,"" said Dr. Takenoshita. ""Those who are planning a C-section should understand that the procedure is linked to more severe pain after delivery and a higher risk of sleep disorders. Anyone having sleep problems during pregnancy or after childbirth should discuss their concerns with their physician, who can evaluate the issue, make recommendations and refer them to a specialist if necessary.""

Older patients who primarily speak a language other than English may face a greater risk of developing delirium after surgery in U.S. hospitals, according to new research presented at the ANESTHESIOLOGY® 2025 annual meeting. The study also found that a lower socioeconomic status further increased patients' risk.

Postoperative delirium is a change in mental function that can cause confusion in up to 15% of surgical patients. In certain high-risk patients, such as those with hip fractures, the incidence can be even higher. It is a significant complication in older adults.

Our study provides evidence that speaking a first or primary language other than English is an independent risk factor for delirium in U.S. patients undergoing anesthesia for surgery, even after ruling out other factors such as prior diagnoses of sleep apnea and type and duration of surgery. We also found that delirium in these patients contributed to longer hospital stays, which can further delay recovery.""

Maximilian Schaefer, M.D., Ph.D., senior author of the study, director of the Center for Anesthesia Excellence at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and associate professor of anesthesia at Harvard Medical School, Boston

U.S. health systems are providing care to increasingly diverse patient populations, including those whose first or primary language is not English. Before and after surgery, language barriers can contribute to confusion and agitation in patients, two factors that are associated with the development of postoperative delirium.

The study included 49,588 patients, age 60 or older, who had general anesthesia for non-cardiac and non-transplant surgery between 2011 and 2024 at a U.S. academic hospital. Researchers reviewed nursing and physician charts and used other assessment methods and tools to identify patients who developed delirium within seven days after surgery. Their analysis was adjusted for patient and procedural factors, including social determinants of health, such as socioeconomic status.

Among the 49,588 patients studied, 4,287 (8.7%) reported speaking a primary language other than English, with Spanish (28.5%) and Cantonese (13.5%) the most prevalent. Overall, 2,328 (4.7%) of the patients studied developed postoperative delirium - 2,093 whose primary language was English and 235 whose primary language was not English. Researchers concluded that patients whose primary language was not English were 23% more likely to develop delirium after surgery, than those whose primary language was English. Additionally, this risk was 31% higher in non-English-speaking patients with lower estimated household incomes.

In patients who primarily spoke Spanish or other non-English languages, 151 of the 235 who developed delirium had interpreter support, but this did not reduce delirium risk.

""Most clinical interactions happen on the wards and in the ICU, where interpreter services aren't always readily available - especially in the first days after surgery, when most delirium occurs,"" said Dr. Schaefer. ""While more research is needed on mechanisms, we suspect that greater confusion and fewer opportunities for verbal reorientation during this early postoperative phase may help explain the elevated delirium risk, even when interpreters are used.""

It is important that the full health care team is alerted to language barriers early during a patient's perioperative care, so that accommodations can be made that extend beyond interpreter services, the authors note. For example, assigning health care providers who speak the patient's language, ensuring family members are present to help with verbal reorientation, and seeing patients in the pre-admission testing clinic to identify risk factors for delirium can all help improve outcomes. However, the authors acknowledge that disparities in health care access and delivery are structural issues that need to be addressed beyond the individual patient level.

It is known that depression is linked to increased incidence of metabolic diseases; now scientists have discovered that different types of depression are linked to different cardiometabolic diseases. This work is presented at the ECNP Congress in Amsterdam.

Over seven years, researchers tracked 5,794 adults, enrolled in the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity (NEO) Study, all of whom were free of diabetes and cardiovascular disease at the study's start. At the start of the study each participant completed a comprehensive questionnaire to assess depressive symptoms. The team identified two distinct depressive profiles: one typified by ""melancholic"" symptoms (such as early morning awakening and reduced appetite), and another by ""atypical/energy-related"" symptoms (such as fatigue, increased sleep, and increased appetite).

Around 8% of the participants developed a cardiometabolic condition during the follow-up period, but the type of condition they developed depended on the type of depression they had. Those with atypical/energy-related"" symptoms were around 2.7 times more likely to develop Type-2 diabetes than individuals without depressive symptoms. They showed no significant increase in cardiovascular disease.

In contrast, those who had ""melancholic"" symptoms were around 1.5 times more at risk of cardiovascular disease (such as a heart attack, or stroke) than individuals without depressive symptoms, with no significant increase in type 2 diabetes.

Lead researcher Dr. Yuri Milaneschi (Amsterdam UNC) said:

""Further metabolic analysis revealed that patients with the atypical/energy-related symptoms showed disruptions in inflammatory and metabolic processes linked to cardiometabolic health. This biological signature was not seen in those with ""melancholic"" symptoms, suggesting biochemical differences in the way that different types of depression link to cardiovascular health. 

We already knew that not all depressions are the same, but this means that we may need to consider how the type of depression someone has impacts different areas of their physical health. It very much pushes us towards the idea of precision psychiatry – the idea that we need to look for physical associations with mental health profiles, so that we can better treat mental illness. To treat sufferers individually"".

Commenting, Dr. Chiara Fabbri (of the University of Bologna) said:

""The prevention and treatment of physical diseases in people with depression are not less important than the treatment of depression. These physical conditions are common and expected to raise, for example the number of people with diabetes (66 million) in the EUR Region will see a 10% increase by 2050 according to the International Diabetes Federation. It is a health care priority to prevent cardiometabolic diseases, diagnose them early, and continue to improve monitoring and treatment. This study on the NEO cohort provides highly valuable data on how to do this better for people suffering from depressive symptoms"".

Scientists at the University of Duisburg-Essen are researching new therapies for aggressive forms of childhood leukemia. For the first time, their approach tries to distinguish between two subtypes using so-called nanobody PROTACs. These attack diseased tissue while sparing healthy cells. The José Carreras Leukaemia Foundation is supporting the project, led by Prof. Dr. Shirley Knauer and Dr. Mike Blueggel from the Faculty of Biology, with 143,740 euros for two years.

The research focuses on molecules that break down certain proteins in cancer cells: nanobody PROTACs (proteolysis targeting chimeras). They couple a binding molecule for the target protein with a signal that causes the cell to destroy this particular protein. This allows a disease-relevant protein to be removed in a targeted manner without damaging healthy structures.

The target protein in this case is the enzyme Taspase 1, which plays a central role in particularly aggressive forms of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). So far, it has been difficult to develop effective strategies against this enzyme. Therefore, researchers are now exploiting differences in the internal degradation machinery of cancer cells for the first time: they want to develop PROTACs that specifically degrade Taspase 1 in the respective form of leukemia.

Another innovation is the use of so-called helicons - small spiral-shaped proteins that, as part of biological PROTACs, establish a connection with the degradation factors described above. This enables the targeted destruction of the protein of interest.

With this dual novel approach, we are opening up an entirely new avenue for personalised leukemia treatment. This project could be groundbreaking, not only for research, but also for the long-term treatment of these particularly aggressive diseases.'

A new global metric shows how everyday foods, from beef to coffee, carry vastly different extinction costs, exposing how our diets and imports quietly shape the future of Earth's wildlife.



Study: Food impacts on species extinction risks can vary by three orders of magnitude. Image Credit: Leszek Kobusinski / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Nature Food, researchers leveraged global food production and consumption data (140 unique items) and a novel, high-resolution ""LIFE"" biodiversity metric to investigate the relative impacts of different foods on species extinction risk, using a metric they term ""extinction opportunity costs.""

Study findings revealed that the impact of producing 1 kg of food can vary by up to three orders of magnitude across different food types. Animal products, especially ruminant meat, and commodities grown in the tropics (e.g., coffee and cocoa), were consistently observed to carry the highest species extinction risk. These findings elucidate the substantial relative costs of agricultural choices on ecology, thereby guiding future conservation and food production policy for sustainable outcomes.

Temperate crops can be low-risk, High-yield crops grown in low-biodiversity regions, such as European sugar beet, which carry among the lowest extinction impacts per kilogram, a stark contrast to tropical sugar cane cultivated in biodiversity hotspots.

The global food production system is increasingly recognized as a primary threat to nature, linked to substantial land-use change and habitat destruction for agriculture. As the world's human population continues to rise, agricultural and food production is now recognized as the leading cause of the ongoing ecological extinction crisis.

Mitigating ongoing biodiversity loss associated with food production requires a robust understanding of which foods are most damaging and where they are produced, thereby informing conservation policy efforts. Unfortunately, previous attempts to quantify the biodiversity impacts of food have been limited.

Standard methods like life-cycle analysis (LCA) often rely on subjective metrics, are limited in their spatial and taxonomic scope, and lack the spatial detail to account for the fact that crops grown in a tropical biodiversity hotspot have a vastly different impact than the same crops grown in a temperate region. A more sophisticated, globally consistent approach is required to inform effective interventions, from individual dietary choices to international trade policy.

Luxury crops carry a heavy toll. Tea, coffee, cocoa, and spices may be consumed sparingly, but they rank among the highest per-kg extinction drivers, especially when sourced from ecologically rich regions like Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, or the Andes.

The present study addresses these knowledge gaps by developing a powerful new biodiversity metric called LIFE (Land-cover change Impacts on Future Extinctions), which leverages detailed global data on food production, consumption, and trade from the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).

LIFE is a high-resolution global map (1.8 km² resolution) that estimates the marginal impact of agricultural land use on the extinction risk of approximately 30,000 terrestrial vertebrate species, calculating the ""extinction opportunity cost."" This cost represents the forgone opportunity to restore biodiversity that arises from continued agricultural land use. In essence, it measures the potential reduction in extinction risk if a parcel of farmland were returned to its natural habitat.

The study used the LIFE metric to evaluate the impacts of 140 individual food products across both the holistic global context and within six exemplar countries with diverse dietary and trade profiles: the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK), Japan, Brazil, India, and Uganda.



Global variation across and within commodities in the expected extinction impact of producing 1 kg of agricultural commodity or commodity group. The lower and upper boundaries of the boxes represent the production-mass-weighted 10th and 90th percentiles, respectively. Horizontal lines represent the weighted global median (50th percentile). Where commodities are grouped, the per-kilogram extinction risk values of each constituent commodity are weighted by their contribution (by mass) to the total global production of that group. 

Dairy's middle-ground impact. While less damaging than beef or lamb, dairy still demands significant land for grazing and feed, placing it well above legumes and grains in biodiversity cost - a reminder that “meat-free” is not always impact-free.

Study findings revealed an unexpectedly high variation in the biodiversity impacts of different foods, spanning up to three orders of magnitude between foods with the lowest impacts versus those with the highest. Animal products were found to have a substantially greater effect on species extinction risk than staple plant-based foods.

Specifically, the global median opportunity cost of ruminant meat (e.g., beef and lamb) was found to be approximately 340 times greater than that of grains by mass. When rerunning the analysis to account for protein content, the impact of ruminant meat remained 100 times higher than that of protein-rich plants like soybeans and other legumes, highlighting the robustness of the analysis and the warning of the observed outcomes.

""Luxury"" crops grown in tropical regions (coffee, cocoa, and tea) also ranked among the most impactful commodities per kilogram. Crucially, the impact also varied dramatically by provenance for the same product; for example, coffee from South America and sub-Saharan Africa had an impact approximately ten times greater than that produced in Southeast Asia.

Study analysis finally revealed that the biodiversity footprints of some nations are overwhelmingly externalized. A staggering 95% of the UK's and 98% of Japan's food-related extinction impacts occur in the countries from which they import.

In contrast, the effects from food consumed in Brazil and India were almost entirely domestic, at 98% and 96%, respectively. In the United States, the impact was also largely domestic, with imports accounting for only about 10%.

Across all countries studied, ruminant meat was the dominant driver of per capita impacts. Even in India, where a third of the population is lacto-vegetarian, ruminant meats (mainly sheep and goat) were found to contribute to 40% of the country's total impact on species extinction due to food production.

Despite widespread vegetarianism, India's extinction footprint is heavily driven by dairy and small ruminants (goat and sheep), which account for around 40% of the country's food-related biodiversity impact.

The present study provides the most detailed and globally comprehensive assessment to date of how different foods contribute to the extinction crisis. Animal products, particularly ruminant meat, and foods grown in tropical biodiversity hotspots were revealed to carry an excessively disproportionate environmental burden. Study analysis underscores the immense potential for dietary change to mitigate harm.

Encouragingly, data from the US-based scenario shows that shifting from a typical Western diet to the EAT-Lancet planetary health diet, with a reduction in ruminant meat consumption from 4% to 1%, reduces the extinction opportunity cost of an individual's diet by almost three-quarters. The study also found that shifting to hypothetical vegetarian and vegan diets in the US resulted in even greater reductions, cutting the remaining impact by more than half again, while a similar shift to a plant-based diet in the UK was found to reduce the effects by just over 50%.

However, the authors are careful to note several important caveats and limitations to their work. First, the analysis does not include all commodities, notably omitting aquatic foods, palm oil, and sugar due to data challenges.

Second, the study relies on relatively coarse data and does not yet account for the intensity of agricultural production, such as intensive versus extensive grazing, or impacts on plants and invertebrates.

Third, the authors stress that their metric is ""marginal,"" meaning it is designed to compare the effect of one additional unit of a food and cannot be simply scaled up to calculate the total global impact of agriculture.

Finally, the study focuses exclusively on extinction risk from land use, and does not measure other critical harms like those from fertilizer runoff, pesticide use, or greenhouse gas emissions.

The authors also caution against simplistic policy interpretations. For example, while the UK and Japan ""offshore"" their biodiversity impact, the paper warns that policies promoting low-yielding domestic agriculture could inadvertently increase reliance on imports from more biodiverse regions, potentially causing a net increase in global biodiversity loss. These findings suggest that while the present scenario appears bleak, informed dietary changes and carefully considered policies may substantially improve future outcomes.

A scoping review reveals that nurses' routine use of non-sterile gloves during IV antibiotic preparation offers no proven protection, and may actually undermine infection control, increase costs, and harm the planet.

Study: Time to Hang Up the Gloves: A Scoping Review of Evidence on Non-Sterile Glove Use During Intravenous Antimicrobial Preparation and Administration. Image credit: New Africa/Shutterstock.com

Nurses commonly wear nonsterile gloves while preparing antimicrobial injections for intravenous use and giving these shots to patients. However, this practice is not supported by specific evidence-based guidelines. A recent report published in the Journal of Advanced Nursing addresses this critical lacuna in healthcare procedures.

While general guidelines exist for using nonsterile gloves, there are no guidelines directing their specific use in this area. The review notes that such glove use is widespread but largely habitual and ritualistic rather than evidence-based. Improper use of nonsterile gloves has been associated with reduced compliance with correct hand hygiene practices, potentially increasing healthcare-associated infections. It also drives up healthcare costs. Still, this practice is common among nurses.

Nonsterile glove use became common with the need for universal precautions when HIV caused an epidemic. Nowadays, it is part of standard precautions and is often taught during nursing training as part of routine clinical skills. This practice is partly driven by scientific reports stating that wearing nonsterile gloves reduces the risk of transferring pathogens between healthcare workers and patients, prevents microorganisms from briefly colonizing the hands, and avoids adverse effects like skin allergy or irritation due to hazardous or irritant chemicals.

According to the World Health Organisation, seven and fifteen percent of hospitalized patients in high-income and low-and-middle-income countries will have a healthcare-associated infection before discharge. This is usually due to cross-contamination caused by failures in hand hygiene and not changing gloves between patients and between procedures.

Emotional responses, such as disgust or anxiety about contamination, were found to strongly shape glove-use decisions, often overriding clinical reasoning or existing hand hygiene guidance.

Hand hygiene has long been recognized as the primary step in preventing and controlling infection. It reduces healthcare-associated infections and antimicrobial resistance. Despite this, healthcare workers worldwide often refuse to follow hand hygiene protocols.

This increases the odds of transferring microbes between surfaces and patients, between patients, and between the healthcare worker and patients, increasing infection risks. This enhances the chances of complications and of death and pushes up healthcare costs. It also drives antimicrobial resistance.

Additionally, incorrect nonsterile glove use increases medical waste and impacts the environment at every step in manufacturing and disposal. Vinyl and nitrile gloves are not biodegradable; thus, glove overuse contributes to environmental waste and carbon emissions. Their disposal releases hazardous chemicals, heavy metals, and microplastics into the air, soil, and water when incinerated.

Improved hand hygiene, inclusive of appropriate non-sterile glove use, could save approximately $16.50 USD in reduced healthcare costs for each dollar invested in an IPC (infection prevention and control) program.

World Health Organisation

While this WHO estimate is cited as a broader context, it was not part of the study's data. However, nurses have no apparent reason to use nonsterile gloves up to half the time they interact with patients, including while preparing or administering intravenous antimicrobials.

These observations explain the need for the current study. The investigators conducted a rigorous scoping review to identify the significant concepts of nonsterile glove use while preparing and administering antimicrobials, find the types of studies performed in this area, including gray literature, and identify research gaps.

After searching five major databases and gray literature (up to February 2024), the researchers found only three relevant studies. Only one of 24 selected in the preliminary round met the inclusion criteria. All others were either conference abstracts or did not deal with glove use.

The other two came from gray literature including various handbooks and guidelines by official organizations. None of them provided direct evidence of how nonsterile gloves would be used in clinical settings for making up and administering intravenous antimicrobials.

One study showed that nonsterile glove use's main situations included cleaning, mobilizing patients, handling linen, handling devices, toileting, personal hygiene, attending to the patient, and in 5% of cases, for any task. It reported that 59% of nonsterile glove use was not indicated. Copying others' practices without question, misconceptions about the hygiene of glove use compared to hand hygiene, and disgust or fear about germs and dirt, drove such use.

The WHO has described “five moments of hand hygiene.” The same study showed that cross-contamination occurs in most cases after or before touching a patient, after a procedure, or after exposure to body fluid. It also reported that nurses were less likely to wash or sanitize their hands after removing their gloves than other healthcare professionals.

Two studies, without any evidence from their own research, suggested that nonsterile glove use was only appropriate if there was likely to be exposure to body fluids or mucous membranes. One explicitly stated that gloves should not be used for intravenous antibiotic preparation and administration.

Surprisingly, no original sources were found to support the few citations in these studies, even after tracing the citation chain backwards until 2000. This process turned up eight articles, none of which provided any evidence in this area. Moreover, many of the limited number of articles were by the same three researchers, indicating that this area has been little studied.

The third study did not discuss nonsterile glove use at all in the context of antibiotic preparation and administration.

Many professional guidelines across the world support this practice in the absence of any supporting evidence. (Notably, many steps in administering intravenous antibiotics involve potential exposure to blood.)

The current ritualistic practice of non-sterile gloves being worn for IV antimicrobial preparation and administration points to an important gap in knowledge and a lack of high-quality research in this important clinical area.

The review also notes that this limited evidence base is partly due to the small, overlapping group of researchers studying glove use, underscoring the need for broader research participation.

A shift is emerging in clinical practice that emphasizes proper hand hygiene and removing gloves between patients to prevent cross-contamination. One included study also reported direct financial and environmental benefits from reducing glove use through educational programs.

The study showed that misusing nonsterile gloves to prepare and administer intravenous antimicrobials may hinder correct hand hygiene, predisposing to cross-contamination and healthcare-associated infections and worsening patient health outcomes.

The review found no direct studies that evaluated infection outcomes or microbial transmission related to glove use during IV antimicrobial preparation, emphasizing the complete absence of empirical evidence in this area. In addition, it drove up the cost of healthcare and increased the amount of healthcare waste and related environmental pollution.

“We found no evidence to support the use of non-sterile gloves in intravenous antimicrobial preparation.” This crucial gap in evidence highlights the need for urgent research using a rigorous framework to create clear guidelines in this area and nonsterile glove use in overall nursing practice. This would strengthen evidence-based clinical practices, enhance nursing education, improve patient health, and reduce healthcare costs and sustainability.

You have come to the ESPN Africa edition, for other ESPN editions, click above.

Herc Gomez and Shaka Hislop discuss the USMNT attacking options as Agyemang, Balogun and Wright all battle to start. (3:54)

The U.S. men's and women's senior national teams will play 25 home friendly matches combined in 2025, and each game requires two simple ingredients: an opponent and a host venue.

How are those opponents scheduled, and how do cities and stadiums ultimately host those games? As U.S. Soccer's managing director of administration, and vice president of events, respectively, Tom King and John Terry (not that John Terry) are primarily responsible for those answers.

Their combined task is less a single jigsaw puzzle and more a game of speed dating. As they move from one conversation to the next, they hope to find a match -- multiple, simultaneous matches, in fact, as they work on opponents and venues for several future games at once -- before they lose their potential partners.

""The relationship side of it is so important,"" King told ESPN. ""In some ways, it can be almost a sales job where you've got a chance of getting an opponent, and you just chase that down like the last bus at night until you get 'em closed."" For King, that could mean waking up at 3 a.m. to call colleagues in Europe.

Terry works in tandem to find an appropriate venue. Neither the opponent nor the venue can be finalized without the other -- and without either, there is no game.

Ideally, they try to secure the best possible opponents for the USMNT and USWNT, in addition to extended and youth national teams, while placing games all over the United States. But the hoops they must jump through can make it difficult.

""To the extent possible, we want to get our team to different parts of the country,"" Terry told ESPN. One of his guiding questions is: ""How do we spread our national team and get as many people watching as possible?""

Fans see the results -- the opponent, the city and the venue -- and, at times, the patterns of games can appear counterintuitive to U.S. Soccer's stated goals. Why are they playing in California, Connecticut or Orlando again when they haven't played in other parts of the country, like the Pacific Northwest, in years? Why is the U.S. playing another game against the same opponent? And tickets cost how much?

U.S. Soccer's decision-makers took ESPN behind the scenes to answer how -- and why -- opponents get scheduled, why venues get selected and how that affects ticket prices.

- Pochettino's USMNT squad comes into focus
- Alex Morgan aims to match USWNT success in business

U.S. women's national team head coach Emma Hayes and U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino have their own wish lists for opponents that they communicate regularly to U.S. Soccer officials. From there, King evaluates who is available and begins his sales pitch to other federations, and Terry works on finding the right venue. Everything is interdependent.

U.S. Soccer considers a handful of factors in selecting hosts for games, from the climate and the city's historical fan support, to quality of hotels and training facilities and broadcast constraints -- including for the opponent.

Venue-specific challenges are as basic as capacity and availability. Scheduling the USWNT against another top-10 team in the world like Brazil at the 70,000-seat SoFi Stadium, as U.S. Soccer did in April, might be a risk worth taking, for example, but a game against lower-tier Portugal makes more sense at an 18,000-seat stadium. The stadium requirements can be as granular as needing a venue with four locker rooms for a four-team SheBelieves Cup event, for example.

There are moments, Terry said, when he must call venues and press for a quick answer on locking in a date, or U.S. Soccer risks losing a prospective opponent. Sometimes, a venue operator is only interested in hosting a game if the opponent is appealing enough.

Lead time is ""golden,"" King said. It means venues are more likely to be available, and it allows U.S. Soccer to better promote the game. Crisis management, however, is part of their jobs, and sometimes U.S. Soccer works for months on plans that never come to fruition.

""We've had a top-five team that we had all the economic conditions sorted, we had the venue sorted, we had the [federation] president on board, we had everything done and dusted to sign a contract to host this team,"" King said. ""And lo and behold, there's a change to the coach, and the coach wants to play a different confederation team between now and the 2026 World Cup on the men's side. So, everything that had been done for the previous 10 months goes out the window, and you start from scratch again.""

Other times, the venue is what needs to change. The U.S. women's national team will end 2025 with a pair of games against Italy in soccer-specific stadiums in Florida, but the original plan for the international window called for a different European opponent in a baseball stadium 2,500 miles away.

King had agreed to terms with the other opponent for the U.S. women's national team back in the spring. Terry worked through the usual autumn availability problems with American football and soccer stadiums -- MLS playoff dates are not set until the fall -- by coming up with a unique solution: playing the game on Black Friday with the roof closed at T-Mobile Park, the home of MLB's Seattle Mariners. The baseball season would be over by late November, and U.S. Soccer would have time to lay grass over the baseball infield. The roof solved any fear around bad weather; then the opponent's schedule changed for an official competition, and they were unavailable to play a friendly in November and December.

The next team on Hayes' wish list was Euro 2025 semifinalist Italy, but Italian officials did not want to fly their players to the West Coast of the United States in the middle of a European season. Thus, the grand idea of a unique event in Seattle, where the USWNT has not played since 2017, was dead.

Each contract for a friendly match is unique, but they all start with what the opponent needs, King said. Successful, popular teams often command an appearance fee to play on the road, and some might also require bonuses based on the commercial success of the game. (King declined to specify those costs due to the sensitivity of negotiations.) Other visiting teams might agree to get a stipend or ask to have certain expenses covered for a delegation of 30-50 people.

""We're very agile; we're not bureaucratic,"" King said. ""When we have an opponent to go after, we go after it. We don't have multiple layers of approval to court a certain team.""

Pratt & Whitney Stadium in East Hartford is a perfect case study for how a myriad of factors can lead to what looks like a result antithetical to the federation's desire to spread out games.

When the USWNT hosts Portugal there on Oct. 26, it will mark the 19th game for the U.S. men and women combined at the stadium since it opened in 2003. The USMNT just played there in June, in addition to their high-profile game against Germany two years ago. That's a high frequency of national team games for a utilitarian college football stadium in a mid-sized city -- but it is not without reason.

Cost is a factor in all scheduling, of course. MLS stadiums (which generally seat around 20,000 people) might cost around $200,000 to rent, while larger NFL stadiums could range from around $500,000 to roughly $1 million for a game, Terry said. Bigger markets are also more expensive because everything costs more, from utilities to turn on the lights to wages for security, ticket scanners, and every other stadium worker.

Only about half of NFL stadiums have grass fields, which is the preferred surface for the U.S. national teams and most opponents. Terry said that if U.S. Soccer needs to lay down temporary grass, that adds at least $500,000 in expenses.

Alex Morgan reacts to her first goal for the USWNT in a friendly vs. China.

Cost is only part of the equation for any game, Terry said. ""The first litmus test is: Is it available to us?""

Which explains how the USMNT ended up hosting four-time World Cup champion Germany in East Hartford in October 2023. U.S. Soccer officials had no doubt that the game would be in great demand among fans no matter where they played it. The problem was finding a place to play.

Germany was keen to play on the East Coast for more favorable travel and for a better kickoff time back home, Terry said. U.S. Soccer staff looked everywhere on the East Coast for a grass field in a large stadium on a Saturday in October, the heart of the American football season, and couldn't find one. UConn football, Pratt & Whitney Stadium's primary tenant, happened to have a bye week preceded by a road game on the date of the eventual game. Terry booked the 36,000-seat stadium, and the game sold out.

Orlando has also become a frequent stop for the men's and women's national teams for its mix of warm weather and accessibility to both Europe and South America. Driven by the anomaly of the COVID-19 pandemic, Exploria Stadium (as it was called then) hosted five straight USWNT games in January and February 2021. The USMNT played there between those games and returned in March of each of the next two years for official matches.

""In a perfect world, we're not going back to the same venue within a year,"" Terry said. ""It's an inexact science; it happens because there are other factors that require it.""

All the aforementioned factors for opponents and venues affect the cost to the fan. Rising ticket prices have become endemic across the sports and entertainment industries. Soccer -- with high-profile events including next year's Men's World Cup in the U.S., Canada and Mexico -- is not immune.

While CONMEBOL's Copa America last year and FIFA's Club World Cup this summer -- both hosted in the United States -- sparked controversy and sparse crowds due to high ticket prices, U.S. Soccer has no influence on setting prices for those games. Still, they certainly hear the complaints -- including the grievances aimed at their own events.

Terry told ESPN that the federation is intentional about making sure that the ""get-in price"" of a game -- the cheapest ticket -- is affordable. He said that the starting price for a U.S. national team game is often cheaper than that of an MLS game or a soccer game run by other promoters in the same city. Those numbers vary greatly by city, event and ticket tier, but a U.S. Soccer ticket is typically 25-30% cheaper than tickets for the home team in that same venue, a federation spokesperson said.

Two factors complicate that position. For a start, the resale market -- which neither U.S. Soccer nor event organizers control -- is where prices balloon. A front-row seat to the USMNT vs. Ecuador friendly in Austin last week cost as low as $84 before fees (which can add up quickly) roughly a week before the game. At the same time, a front-row resale ticket just a few sections away cost $297.50.

Dynamic pricing, which means costs fluctuate based on demand, is also a factor. The starting price for a ticket to the USWNT's game against New Zealand at CPKC Stadium this month was $45, Terry said. But the 11,500-seat stadium has sold out every Kansas City Current NWSL game to date, and high demand for the uniquely small venue choice means that current prices trend higher. Terry said that U.S. Soccer's pricing model rewards fans who purchase early, and he argues U.S. Soccer games are ""more accessible than many other sporting entities in this country.""

U.S. Soccer recently announced that it would cap tickets sold to the American Outlaws, the largest supporters' group for the U.S. national teams, at $45 plus fees for all games hosted by the federation through October 2026.

""We've always believed soccer should be for everyone,"" American Outlaws co-founder Justin Brunken said in July. ""This partnership with U.S. Soccer helps eliminate one of the biggest barriers -- cost -- and makes it possible for more passionate fans to stand, sing and support together.""

Still, that partnership is limited to American Outlaws members and not the wider public. U.S. Soccer is experimenting with free parking for everyone at this month's USWNT game in Hartford. The federation worked with sponsor Coca-Cola for discounted concessions earlier this year at a men's national team game in Nashville.

USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino believes his side need to be more ""clinical"" after their 1-1 draw against Ecuador.

U.S. Soccer doesn't have a home stadium where the federation can control food and beverage or parking costs, which leaves those prices to be set by the venue. At the USWNT's game in St. Paul, Minnesota, earlier this year, U.S. Soccer spent nearly $38,000 to offset concession costs and create a $2 menu for hot dogs, popcorn, nachos and water. The idea came based on direct feedback from U.S. Soccer's Fan Council, which was established in 2018 as a bridge of communication between fans and the federation.

The five members of the Fan Council attend as many national team games as possible and gather fan feedback on-site both informally and formally, in addition to the input they get from fans online. They identify common themes that they then bring to U.S. Soccer in quarterly in-person meetings and monthly virtual meetings.

""Much of the feedback focuses on ticketing prices, game atmosphere and the overall matchday experience,"" Lauralynn Stephen, a vice chair of the council, told ESPN. ""I can say that over the past year, we've seen some really exciting, tangible changes that reflect fan feedback.""

Stephen said that fans communicated a desire for better concession prices after experiencing them at a game at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, which is known for its affordable food and beverages as low as $2. She personally raised the topic with U.S. Soccer in one of their meetings with the Fan Council.

Stephen said that communication around gameday from the federation has improved in simple ways, like a ""Know Before You Go"" website page detailing parking and other logistics.

""The culture's improving; the communication, the collaboration is absolutely there; it's in place,"" Stephen said. ""The future's looking very bright for future council members and fans in general, because U.S. Soccer is very actively engaging, and they're very interested in what fans are feeling for the matchday experience.""

Scheduling strong, diverse opponents -- especially from Europe -- is increasingly a challenge for U.S. Soccer.

FIFA has set the international calendars for men's and women's play through 2029 and 2030 for the women and men, respectively. European men's opponents are available for friendlies in March and June next year ahead of the World Cup, but those windows are not replicated in the three years that follow. The same issue is now true in the women's game.

""The biggest challenge really is the advent of the Nations League for women,"" King said. Twelve of the top 20 women's teams in the world are from Europe. Of the 10 international windows between now and the 2027 Women's World Cup, six of them are being utilized by UEFA for World Cup qualifying and playoffs, in addition to more Nations League programming.

The USWNT won't be able to schedule a European opponent in 2026 until next October, and even then, they won't be able to play teams participating in the World Cup qualifying playoffs. King said he already has ""feelers"" out to six potential European teams for that window.

The need for the four-time World Cup champion USWNT to play strong teams, along with the Europe's crowded official schedule, has led to the U.S. women more frequently playing Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan and South Korea as opponents in recent years.

Among U.S. Soccer's solutions for scheduling challenges is collaboration with Mexico's federation, the FMF, which gives those visiting teams two different high-quality opponents in relatively close locations. (Mexico frequently ""hosts"" games in the U.S., which creates its own challenges to find four venues in a week). Four days after Ecuador plays the USMNT in Austin this month, Ecuador will play Mexico in Guadalajara.

New Zealand's women's team will play Mexico twice before traveling to Kansas City for a game against the USWNT this month.

There are also venue challenges that go beyond cost and location. Particularly on the men's side, the United States often faces a partisan crowd for the visitors despite playing on home soil. An overtly pro-Korean crowd for a recent USMNT friendly at Sports Illustrated Stadium in Harrison, New Jersey, was the latest reminder of that. Last year, the U.S. lost 5-1 to Colombia in front of a pro-Colombian crowd of 55,494 in Maryland. Terry views the challenge as an opportunity.

""The cool part about the United States is that we have people from all over the world who live here, and regardless of what jersey they wear when they come to one of our games, they're in our ecosystem, and they might be a future coach,"" Terry said. ""Their kids might be future players. They might be a player. And they could be a referees. And so, I think it's on us to figure out: How can we be in service to them? Not just in the stadium but in the other 364 days a year. It's an opportunity to connect with a lot of people and bring them under our umbrella. Our ultimate goal here is grow the sport of soccer in the country.""

There is one important addendum: That entire approach of spreading out games applies to friendly matches. ""The flip side of that is, for an official game -- a Nations League qualifier or World Cup qualifier -- we're doing the complete opposite,"" King said.

For those official matches, winning -- and qualifying -- trumps all, which helps explain why Columbus, Ohio, has hosted multiple USMNT vs. Mexico World Cup qualifying games in February, the dead of winter. There was a climate advantage for the USMNT, but Columbus was also a location that U.S. Soccer felt it could guarantee a pro-U.S. crowd, which isn't the case in many areas of the U.S. for a USA-Mexico game. King said the federation worked with former USMNT head coach Gregg Berhalter in the 2022 World Cup qualifying cycle ""to make sure that the guiding principle on that was putting our team in the best possible light to win by having a raucous home crowd.""

Three of the USMNT's qualifying games in that cycle were played in cold months in Ohio (including a 2-0 win over Mexico in Cincinnati) and another in Minnesota. Those locations were selected both for guaranteeing pro-U.S. crowds and for weather ostensibly more suited to American players. The USMNT has dealt with stifling heat and flooded fields for road qualifying games across Concacaf.

""It wasn't a surprise for us to play on a Saturday at noon in Azteca Stadium in June [against Mexico for World Cup qualifying],"" King said. ""And we're also not looking for reciprocity and being spiteful. But at the same time, how can we put our players in the best possible environment to win, when the majority of them are playing in northern climates, whether that's MLS teams or in Europe? We're used to the cold. It's also not uncommon for us to go to Honduras and play midweek at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. These are things that the home team gets the choice to do.""

U.S. Soccer's meticulous planning is not the norm everywhere. There are confederations who are comfortable with scheduling games on less than two months' notice. ""That's untenable for us,"" King said.

""The further out that we can get these games on the books is just a huge source of satisfaction with regards to knowing what we're doing, knowing where we're going from a commercial standpoint. You've got a much longer runway to be able to promote the games.""

King said that U.S. Soccer intentionally has not scheduled June's men's games yet so that they can book an opponent in reaction to December's World Cup Draw. Beyond that variable, however, U.S. Soccer is already planning as far out as June 2027. The fewer late-night buses to chase down in the process, the better.","{'href': 'https://africa.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

The United States Under-20 men's national team has reached a familiar stage at the 2025 FIFA U-20 World Cup, with Sunday's quarterfinal against Morocco serving as a border of sorts.

On the men's side, the U.S. U20s have made it to the quarterfinal of the U-20 World Cup (which is held once every two years) nine separate times but taking the next step has been immensely difficult. Only once, in 1989, has the U.S. advanced to the semifinals, and each of the team's last five U-20 World Cup trips have ended in a heartbreaking quarterfinal defeat.

However, this year's team may be equipped to go further. While the U.S. has topped its group on several previous occasions, this may be the most experienced group of young pros that U.S. Soccer has been able to send to the tournament. Wins over traditional powers like France and Italy have underlined what this young group is capable of, with the USYNT posting 3-0 wins over both of those nations while in Chile (which is hosting the event).

Head coach Marko Mitrović is lead by Benjamin Cremaschi, a former teammate of Lionel Messi's at Inter Miami who is currently on loan with Parma in the Italian top flight. Despite being a two-way midfielder, Cremaschi has stood out on the attacking side at the U-20 World Cup, and currently leads all players with five goals.

Here's what to know to watch the U.S. Under-20 national team take on Morocco in the quarterfinals of the Under-20 World Cup:

The U.S. men's national team may have hit some unwanted low points during Mauricio Pochettino's divisive tenure, but the Argentine certainly has the backing of striker Folarin Balgoun.

The former Tottenham Hotspur and Paris Saint-Germain manager has lost seven of his 19 games in charge of USMNT, including the final of this summer's Gold Cup. Pochettino followed that setback on home soil up with an underwhelming pair of friendlies against South Korea and Japan last month before overseeing a much-improved display against Ecuador on Friday night. However, that heralded clash still resulted in a 1–1 draw.

Balogun scored USMNT's equalizer after falling behind to Enner Valencia's first-half strike in a performance which Pochettino took time to praise. The admiration is clearly mutual.

“I have so much confidence in Poch and what he's able to do for us,” Balogun gushed this weekend. “He's given us so many ideas going forward, and added so much structure. I feel like the confidence we have in Poch is obviously showing.”

Defender Tim Ream wasn't quite so emphatic. In response to a question about whether Pochettino's principles were finally seeping into the squad, he shrugged: “Um, yeah, I think so.”

Ream acknowledged that “it was always going to take a little bit of time for their ideas to really take hold with the entire group” while adding: “You saw the energy that we played with. That's something that they've really preached. And now I think everybody really is starting to understand and grasp that mantra of playing with intensity and being aggressive with and without the ball.

“Guys have been trying to play with that energy, but I think it's also marrying the tactical ideas and the strategy with playing with energy and the aggressiveness. And there's a balance to it. There's a line you have to get up to, and you have to touch, without crossing.”

On top of lauding his manager, Balogun also highlighted the impact a fervent home crowd had on him and his teammates.

Crowds during the U.S.-staged Gold Cup were worryingly low. It was a sellout crowd for the final in Houston, yet most of the 70,000 in attendance in Texas were rooting for Mexico rather than the home nation. Even the semifinal against Guatemala in St. Louis was noticeably partisan in favor of the visitors—something which Pochettino pointedly highlighted at the time.

“I would love to see my players playing with 70,000 people cheering,” Pochettino sighed. “We need the people. We need the fans. The fans have one year to realize how important are the fans in soccer.”

The 20,000 at the Q2 Stadium in Austin to watch Friday's 1–1 draw with Ecuador offered a hint that Pochettino's pleas had been heard.

“The crowd helped us to really motivate us and push us on,” Balogun noted. “I think they don't realize how much we as players rely on their support. It really gives us a boost. It's always nice when we can play at an amazing stadium like today with the home crowd supporting us and cheering us on.”

Balogun's teammate Tim Weah directly credited the supporters bellowing out “U-S-A” for the equalizer. “We ended up getting the goal thanks to them,” he claimed. “It's always great having that turn up.”

If not listed, please contact your TV provider.

It's Monday! And if that is altogether too much excitement for the start of another working week, I'll tell you now there's reason to be buzzing. We've got some big World Cup qualifiers ahead of us as the men's international break finally kicks into gear then come Wednesday it's the second round of games in the Women's Champions League. I'm James Benge, let's get to it.

All times U.S./Eastern

Monday, Oct. 6🏆 World Cup Qualifier: Cameroon vs. Angola, 12 p.m. ➡️ ESPN App🏆 World Cup Qualifier: Northern Ireland vs. Germany, 2:45 p.m. ➡️ Fox Sports 2🏆 World Cup Qualifier: Honduras vs. Haiti, 8 p.m. ➡️ Paramount+, CBS Sports Network🏆 World Cup Qualifier: Costa Rica vs. Nicaragua, 10 p.m. ➡️ Paramount+, CBS Sports Network

Every coach in the international game will tell you that performances are more important than results and if that is indeed the case, then the USA look to be trending in the right direction. A 1-1 draw with Ecuador might not seem much to write home about on paper, but for starters it is worth bearing in mind that Friday's opponents have just finished second in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying and have some of the best defensive talent in the sport. When Enner Valencia gave them a 24th minute lead in Austin, La Tri could well have expected to hold on.

Instead, Mauricio Pochettino's side penned back their visitors, dominating possession and taking the vast majority of the shots before Folarin Balogun's equalizer following some gorgeous interplay down the right. A 1-1 draw was no less than the USMNT deserved and although this is the sort of bar so low you might stumble over it, you could not argue with Tony Meola's assessment on Call It What You Want that this was the team's best game under Pochettino.

This seems like a team who is starting to coalesce around the back three that Pochettino introduced in the second half of a defeat to South Korea in September. It seems to fit personnel who were there -- Chris Richards and Timothy Weah have looked particularly adept -- and those who are yet to join up with the group. Imagine the damage that Antonee Robinson might do down the left with a little more support behind him and Sergino Dest across from him. Already you can see experimentation with the base template too, Weston McKennie drifting into midfield from a nominal role as the right-sided attacking midfielder while Weah dangerously attacked space infield from right wing back.

Crucial to making a 3-4-2-1 work to its fullest is a center forward who can do a bit of everything, attacking the number 10 position when his support forwards drift wide and stretching the defense with runs in behind. In Balogun the USA got that on Friday night, as Chuck Booth explains:

Since the day it became apparent he was entertaining a switch of international allegiance, Balogun had been heralded as the No.9 for the home World Cup. Friday was a sign as to why such thinking was only somewhat premature. He really could slot into this system quite elegantly.

And now there is time to bed that system in. It is easy to see what the vision might be from here out. The US should beat Australia in Denver on Tuesday night. From there on, Pochettino can hope to get even more of his best players together in November and March, testing them out against high grade South American and potentially European opponents such that the hosts are raring to go come the summer. Whether that actually transpires is still a pretty open question. It wasn't so long ago that the US seemed to be stumbling in the dark in pursuit of the basics. At least now though, they appear to have the building blocks.

While the hosts can think about how they might want to line up next summer there are plenty of other nations with work to do if they are to even play in the World Cup. The expanded 48-team structure might have afforded more opportunities for European qualifiers but the smaller groups in UEFA competitions have thrown the door open to a bit more variance, meaning that, for instance, there is real jeopardy for Germany on their trip to Northern Ireland. Having already been surprised once in Slovakia they can ill afford a defeat in Belfast if they want to avoid the playoffs by finishing first.

The stakes are similarly high for Belgium, who face Wales on Monday with both sides battling to just catch up with Group J leaders North Macedonia, on whom they hold a game in hand. Lose in Cardiff and what is left of the Belgian golden generation would be facing a very tricky trip to Kazakhstan in November. Italy too will be fearing what comes with dropped points when they host Israel in Udine. Avoiding defeat would have Gennaro Gattuso's team set fare for a top two berth that has seemed in doubt at some stages of the cycle, but realistically only nine points from nine will give them a chance of overhauling Norway.

As ever, though, it is Africa that promises to deliver the greatest drama on the final days of its first phase. Cape Verde, the island nation of just over half a million people, can secure its first ever berth at a World Cup with a win over Eswatini. Meanwhile by far the most populous nation in the continent -- and one of its great footballing powers -- has an almighty struggle on its hands. Nigeria must beat Benin by two goals to have even a chance of a top two finish in Group C, something which may be enough for them to reach the second round qualifiers. Even with a win they could really do with a helping hand from Rwanda, who play in South Africa.

To make matters worse, Nigeria's journey to Uyo after a win in Lesotho was delayed by a cracked windscreen on their plane, leading to a grim 20 hours of disrupted flights and long waits. That is hardly optimal preparation for one of the biggest games the Super Eagles have played in years. 

Meanwhile in Asia, Qatar must make home advantage pay as they take on the United Arab Emirates in Al Rayyan knowing a defeat could well see them eliminated from the tournament they hosted in 2022. Given the controversy around them and Saudi Arabia hosting the fourth round phase of AFC qualifying, the pressure is certainly on Qatar. The coming days, then, will be pivotal in shaping the participants in the World Cup.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Maresca opens up to Italian media about PSG win and Liverpool red","https://chelsea.news/2025/10/maresca-psg-win-red/","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 06:45:00 GMT","

The international break is frustrating because you want to see your club in action – but the consolation is that you do get some interesting quotes from players when they speak to the media in their home country, usually in a less guarded way than how they speak to the English media.

It turns out that goes for managers too – they are always very cautious in pressers, but more relaxed in their native language, speaking outside the direct context of a game.

Enzo Maresca has been back in Italy speaking about his summer success with Chelsea at the Club World Cup.

“It's a great feeling. This is my second season at the club, but we'd never won in the last minute at home before. The reaction that led to the sending off was instinctive, but maybe it was worth it,” the coach said of his sending off against Liverpool last weekend.

“We're talking about one of the biggest clubs in the world, one that has struggled in recent years for various reasons,” Maresca continued in quotes translated by Football Italia.

Beating Liverpool was huge – certainly one on Maresca's biggest results so far. But the victory over PSG remains clearly the biggest:

“We had a great game. It was a classic situation: Everyone had PSG as favourites,” the manager said.

“We beat a team that, I think, were the strongest in the world at that moment. But I don't go into work every day because we won the World Championship, I do it because I love it. I don't wake up in the morning thinking about the titles we've won.

“We played seven different games. We tried to make changes and tried to surprise opponents. It went well. There were several injuries, but it was worth it and I wouldn't change anything given the result. The trophy is wonderful, even if it is a bit heavy.”

By Martín O'donnell

October 13, 2025 10:10AM EDT

Who says that nothing lasts forever? Roman Weidenfeller may have retired from professional soccer in 2018, but even years after hanging up the gloves, his connection with Borussia Dortmund remains untouched. Off the field, the legendary goalkeeper continues to represent the Black and Yellow around the world. In an exclusive interview with Bolavip, the 45-year-old discusses his current role with the European giants, among many other topics.

“I am very thankful to have this kind of job as a brand ambassador for Borussia Dortmund,” Weidenfeller tells Bolavip. “I played 16 years for Borussia Dortmund, and I am now on the marketing side and see the world through different eyes. I have the chance to travel all over the world. I can support and work for our brand, Borussia Dortmund, and feel how powerful and great Black and Yellow is all over the world.“

Now as a club ambassador, Weidenfeller remains a symbol of the Black and Yellow as Dortmund increase their footprint in the United States. The club's presence at the Times Square Cup in New York City for the fourth straight year was just a reflection of its growing popularity in the country, which has impressed Weidenfeller.

“I am very proud. We've had a lot of success and support from the United States. Not only from the United States, but from all over the world. We have a big community in Mexico. There are crazy, Black and Yellow fans. And also the fans and support here in the United States…they have been growing in the last few years. And we felt it during the last Club World Cup when we saw the stadiums where we were playing,” Weidenfeller says.

Roman Weidenfeller continues to represent Borussia Dortmund as a club ambassador.

Winner of back-to-back Bundesliga titles (2010/11, 2011/12) and two German Cups (2012, 2017) during his 16-year stint at the club, Weidenfeller will always feel the love from Dortmund fans wherever he goes.

In the U.S., many of those fans were inevitably thrilled to see one of their own donning the Black and Yellow when Christian Pulisic played for the first team from 2016 to 2019. Weidenfeller watched Pulisic make his way up from the academy, and has nothing but great memories about those years.

“Look, I first met him when he was a kid and joined Borussia Dortmund. It was the first time he came to a professional team to train and I saw how talented he was. He was very fast, he had perfect technique. He had a great nose for the situation to create a shot. He's a great player,” Weidenfeller remembers about Pulisic, who went on to play for Chelsea before joining his current team, AC Milan.

“So I feel, right now, he is big and he can organize himself in the future. Just recently, he won the Champions League, which I didn't win (laughs). So I have a lot of respect for Christian. He is one of the best American soccer players. Now, he has joined AC Milan. He has had a great career, and I hope that in the future, he will be healthy enough and can stay in sports for a long time.“

Even though he joked about not winning a Champions League like Pulisic did, Weidenfeller can take pride in boasting the most coveted accolade for a soccer player: a World Cup medal.

In 2014, he was a member of the German national team that made it all the way to the promised land in Brazil, making indelible history in a country that lives and breathes soccer. Needless to say, that achievement has been defining for Weidenfeller's legacy.

“Of course, the Champions League cup is big. And of course, when you win the championship in Germany, the trophy is also big. But in the end, the World Cup is actually the most important Cup and trophy you can win in soccer,” Weidenfeller admits. “I had the chance to touch this trophy and hold it up in the air. I can't imagine how we could have organized this team to have won the World Cup in Brazil. But in the end, we had a great team, we had great teamwork, and we started the tournament in Brazil saying that we wanted to win it.

Roman Weidenfeller celebrates with the trophy after the 2014 World Cup final.

“Everyone was smiling and saying ‘yes, of course we want to win.' We were the first team from Europe to win (a World Cup) in South America. And we said ‘yes.' Of course, it's not easy with the climate, with Brazil, and all the other countries, but we had the idea to win and we were completely focused on winning that tournament. And in the end, we won it!

“It was great teamwork and it was amazing. For me, in the end, I won the title at the World Cup and for your whole life, you're a World Cup champion. This makes me very proud and I'm very thankful for my teammates. They organized with me and together we had great success.“

Perhaps the most memorable triumph from Germany‘s World Cup campaign was the semifinal victory over Brazil. While the hosts were seen as strong candidates to win the title, Weidenfeller watched how his teammates put seven past the five-time world champs, in a blowout win that continues to make noise.

“When we started the game against Brazil, nobody could imagine how it would go and how we could organize and win 7-1. I sat on the bench and the first attacks came from Brazil. We made counter-attacks. With the first counter-attack and the second counter-attack, we scored a goal. After that, Brazil was struggling a little bit. But in the end, it brought us big, big respect from the Brazilian guys, from fans, and from the public,” Weidenfeller recalls.

“We did not have smiles on our faces. We were not laughing. We didn't do anything. We won this game and were very respectful and we waited to celebrate until our colleagues from Brazil left the pitch. And after they went into the dressing rooms, we celebrated. And this was a big, big key. In the final, all the Brazilian guys supported us against Argentina. And so we had the chance to win this big, big title.“

While the 7-1 win over Brazil may be one of, if not the first game that comes to mind when thinking about Germany's 2014 World Cup win, their campaign also included wins against Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Germany started their journey with a commanding 4-0 victory over Portugal and ended it with a dramatic, hard-fought 1-0 win in extra time against Argentina in the final.

“I had the chance to play against maybe the two biggest players in the world, Messi and Ronaldo, and also I played against the Brazilian Ronaldo and Ronaldinho too. But look, just recently when I met some kids and youth players, everybody asked me, ‘Did you even play against Ronaldo?' I say, yes. ‘Messi?' Yes. And they couldn't believe it, you know. I said, yes, I played against both. And yeah, it made me proud and I'm very thankful to have had the chance to play in big football matches. So…yeah, of course, both guys are amazing to play against.“

The World Cup saw him face both Ronaldo and Messi in the same tournament, but Weidenfeller had a larger history of matches against the Portuguese star at the club level. His record against CR7 includes an epic win in the 2013 Champions League semifinals, when Dortmund upset Real Madrid to make the final at Wembley.

“I had the chance to play against Ronaldo a lot more than Messi,” Weidenfeller says. “And of course, when Ronaldo saw me, you know what happened. So we always had big, big matches against Real Madrid, big matches against Juventus. And with Portugal against Germany. So it was always a challenge and it was always amazing to have had these chances to play against him.”

Speaking of Messi, Weidenfeller also credits the Argentine star's move to MLS side Inter Miami for boosting soccer's awareness and popularity in the United States.

“I mean, Lionel Messi is a big brand in soccer. And when he joined the MLS, of course, it became more popular,” the Dortmund icon says. “And now everybody is watching soccer in Miami. Before, it was always people going for basketball or for holidays. And now, people are going there to enjoy the MLS and Inter Miami CF. 

“So Messi, and also Marco Reus, support the MLS. And Marco won the (MLS) title when he played and joined the LA Galaxy. He won the title. It's amazing. It's amazing for these guys and it's amazing for the MLS to have this support from these guys and in the end, they make this league very popular around the world.“

While Messi may take most of the limelight, Weidenfeller is also paying close attention to Marco Reus‘ performance in the league. A Dortmund legend just like him, the midfielder took his talents to MLS in 2024 after 12 years with the Black and Yellow, spending six of them alongside the goalkeeper.

The Borussia Dortmund team lines up ahead of the 2013 UEFA Champions League final.

“When I met Marco for the first time when he joined Borussia Dortmund, he was a big, big player, but he is now a big brand too. A big brand for Borussia Dortmund, also for Puma, and also for the MLS. He's such a nice guy. He's very smart. He's very humble,” Weidenfeller says of Reus, whom he hopes to welcome back to Dortmund one day. But first, he wants his former teammate to continue shining in MLS.

“I'm looking forward to seeing Marco when he comes back. But now he has time to play and he has to play soccer,” Weidenfeller clarifies. “For Borussia Dortmund as a brand, it is good. Here in the US, we have an old icon or an old teammate from Borussia Dortmund. He's very spectacular and powerful here in the MLS. And it's good for our brand, Borussia Dortmund.“

Apart from Reus or Pulisic, Weidenfeller has played with countless superstars who donned the Borussia Dortmund uniform. The goalkeeper captained teams that included the likes of Robert Lewandowski, Mats Hummels, and Mario Gotze, among many others. Therefore, it's hard for him to name just one teammate who stood out.

“Look, everybody impressed me,” Weidenfeller explains. “I joined Borussia Dortmund when I was very young, I was 21 and I sat in the dressing room and met for the first time Jürgen Kohler, Stefan Reuter, (Tomáš) Rosický, (Márcio) Amoroso…amazing guys. And now, I have the chance to sometimes play with these guys in the global legends games around the world. It's amazing. 

“But also in my time, in my career and as a captain, a lot of young players joined us. (Jadon) Sancho, (Ousmane) Dembélé, (Pierre-Emerick) Aubameyang, so many guys. Not in my career, but (Erling) Haaland and (Jude) Bellingham also (played for Dortmund).

“And for me, (Alexander) Isak. Nobody talked about Isak before. Isak is now one of the biggest players in the Premier League. And he joined us as a young player. … So I'm looking, not forward, I'm looking straight back to have this chance to join this moment with these great players. And I mean, Borussia Dortmund is a big, big brand. And for the young players, to join us and grow up with Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League, they have the chance to take the next step.

“And in the end, looking back, it was always a great time. And it's nice to have had the chance to play with and make friends with these guys. And always have the chance to call them or see each other on the pitch when we play against each other. So it's always humbling and beautiful that they come and they put you in their arms and say, ‘Hey, how is it going and how is work?' And everything's fine.

“Sports have the power, and especially soccer, to create a different lifestyle, a different life, and sport has the power in your whole world and in your whole life. It's not important what language you speak. It's not important what your religion is. It's more important you make friends and you are teammates. And sports have the power to create something special. There are guys who study at university or make a school team and then there are other guys who come from a small town. I do not speak English very well but in the end, I had the chance to play with all the guys. And we always created a good time together.“

Besides teaming up with other stars throughout his successful career, Weidenfeller also worked under world-renowned managers. Again, choosing just one of them may not be easy. Still, Jürgen Klopp and Joachim Löw deserve special mentions.

“I learned a lot from each manager. But each manager had a little bit of a different style. And the most success I had, of course, was with Klopp and with Löw. Klopp at the club level and Löw at the national team level. When we talk about these guys, both guys are very smart and very human,” Weidenfeller says. “And in the end, they talk with the people and connect with the people well. And so the people have to work more for these coaches and managers. And the player knows he has to work harder than ever before. And so the success is coming.“

Löw led Germany to the World Cup title in Brazil, in an unforgettable experience for Weidenfeller. But it's safe to say Klopp was particularly influential in his career, coaching the Dortmund team that won multiple domestic titles and made the Champions League final in 2013, putting many players on the map.

“Look, listen, Jürgen is not only the head coach, he's not only a manager, he's like our father. And he treats us like we are family, you know? He did not say, ‘Roman, you have to…' He said, ‘hey, come on, guy, what's happened? You have to go in front. And the guy's coming in the back, he's going with you. You have to go for it.' He was always very strict and charismatic, but in the end, smart and human, you know?,” Weidenfeller adds, reflecting on his time under Klopp.

After making a name for himself at Borussia Dortmund, Klopp went on to find even more success at the helm of Liverpool. Now the Head of Global Soccer for Red Bull, he appears to be done with coaching, at least for the foreseeable. Still, Dortmund fans obviously hope to see Klopp back at the club someday.

“I saw him at an event in Hamburg, Germany. I'm always very impressed by him and feel great pleasure when I get to see him. But also hopefully (see him) in Germany and at Dortmund… I support Jürgen Klopp, you know, as a person. And I can imagine he doesn't want to have the pressure of the whole day, like a manager or head coach,” Weidenfeller says.

Roman Weidenfeller greets fans after a game.

While Klopp and other legends who also shaped Borussia Dortmund's history have moved on, Roman Weidenfeller remains a steadfast pillar of the club, serving in a new capacity. A match made in heaven, his journey with the team began in 2002 and continues to thrive beyond his playing days. Retirement has not diminished his bond with the Black and Yellow, proving that some connections truly do last forever.

October 13 – Rights group Fossil Free Football has criticised FIFA for “climate change complicity” after FIFA president Gianni Infantino said it could be too hot to stage the World Cup in summer. 

In a statement, Fossil Free Football said that “instead of fighting to hold on to a climate safe for summer football as we have always known it, FIFA has actively contributed to the global heating that ensures it is no longer possible.

“Despite committing to halve its emissions, it has massively expanded its competitions and handed its giant platform to mega-polluting oil companies and airlines. The 2026 World Cup will be the most polluting event of all time, bigger than any previous tournament and covered in promotional messaging from the world's biggest oil company, Saudi Aramco.”

Last week, on the sidelines of the European Football Clubs – formerly European Club Association – general assembly in the Italian capital Rome, Infantino said to “keep an open mind” about moving major tournaments away from the summer. The Qatar 2022 World Cup was the first global finals to be staged in the European winter because of the soaring temperatures in June and July in Doha. The 2034 World Cup in Saudi Arabia could face a similar rejig.

However, this summer's major tournaments – the expanded 32-team Club World Cup in the United States and Euro 2025 in Switzerland – proved that climate change is affecting football worldwide with high temperatures heavily affecting matches. That has offered Infantino a useful excuse to make a second winter World Cup a more palatable option for other stakeholders in the game.

FIFA is also considering expanding the Club World Cup from 32 teams to 48 teams and staging the finals, from 2029 onwards, on a biannual basis, even if the tournament is not yet financially stable.

Saudi Arabia's SURJ invested $1 billion in streaming platform DAZN which acquired the broadcast rights for the Club World Cup for $1 billion. The prize money on offer at the tournament was $1 billion while the cost of staging it was also around $1 billion. FIFA claimed to have generated more than $2 billion from the tournament.

The expansionism flies in the face of climate change.

At the same time, FIFA signed up Aramco, Saudi Arabia's state oil company, as its leading partner last year. Fossil Free Football said: “It's time for FIFA to stop actively making this crisis worse. This means breaking its ties to Aramco and other polluters and reversing the expansionist agenda opposed by almost everyone in football.”

Frank Huisingh of the rights group added: “Fans see how the climate crisis impacts football. The actions of the fossil fuel industry and their allies now threaten to take summer World Cups from us, an iconic part of being a fan in this part of the world. It's unacceptable that FIFA is still selling its huge platform to Aramco and its pro-oil allies.”

If not listed, please contact your TV provider.

It's Monday! And if that is altogether too much excitement for the start of another working week, I'll tell you now there's reason to be buzzing. We've got some big World Cup qualifiers ahead of us as the men's international break finally kicks into gear then come Wednesday it's the second round of games in the Women's Champions League. I'm James Benge, let's get to it.

All times U.S./Eastern

Monday, Oct. 6🏆 World Cup Qualifier: Cameroon vs. Angola, 12 p.m. ➡️ ESPN App🏆 World Cup Qualifier: Northern Ireland vs. Germany, 2:45 p.m. ➡️ Fox Sports 2🏆 World Cup Qualifier: Honduras vs. Haiti, 8 p.m. ➡️ Paramount+, CBS Sports Network🏆 World Cup Qualifier: Costa Rica vs. Nicaragua, 10 p.m. ➡️ Paramount+, CBS Sports Network

Every coach in the international game will tell you that performances are more important than results and if that is indeed the case, then the USA look to be trending in the right direction. A 1-1 draw with Ecuador might not seem much to write home about on paper, but for starters it is worth bearing in mind that Friday's opponents have just finished second in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying and have some of the best defensive talent in the sport. When Enner Valencia gave them a 24th minute lead in Austin, La Tri could well have expected to hold on.

Instead, Mauricio Pochettino's side penned back their visitors, dominating possession and taking the vast majority of the shots before Folarin Balogun's equalizer following some gorgeous interplay down the right. A 1-1 draw was no less than the USMNT deserved and although this is the sort of bar so low you might stumble over it, you could not argue with Tony Meola's assessment on Call It What You Want that this was the team's best game under Pochettino.

This seems like a team who is starting to coalesce around the back three that Pochettino introduced in the second half of a defeat to South Korea in September. It seems to fit personnel who were there -- Chris Richards and Timothy Weah have looked particularly adept -- and those who are yet to join up with the group. Imagine the damage that Antonee Robinson might do down the left with a little more support behind him and Sergino Dest across from him. Already you can see experimentation with the base template too, Weston McKennie drifting into midfield from a nominal role as the right-sided attacking midfielder while Weah dangerously attacked space infield from right wing back.

Crucial to making a 3-4-2-1 work to its fullest is a center forward who can do a bit of everything, attacking the number 10 position when his support forwards drift wide and stretching the defense with runs in behind. In Balogun the USA got that on Friday night, as Chuck Booth explains:

Since the day it became apparent he was entertaining a switch of international allegiance, Balogun had been heralded as the No.9 for the home World Cup. Friday was a sign as to why such thinking was only somewhat premature. He really could slot into this system quite elegantly.

And now there is time to bed that system in. It is easy to see what the vision might be from here out. The US should beat Australia in Denver on Tuesday night. From there on, Pochettino can hope to get even more of his best players together in November and March, testing them out against high grade South American and potentially European opponents such that the hosts are raring to go come the summer. Whether that actually transpires is still a pretty open question. It wasn't so long ago that the US seemed to be stumbling in the dark in pursuit of the basics. At least now though, they appear to have the building blocks.

While the hosts can think about how they might want to line up next summer there are plenty of other nations with work to do if they are to even play in the World Cup. The expanded 48-team structure might have afforded more opportunities for European qualifiers but the smaller groups in UEFA competitions have thrown the door open to a bit more variance, meaning that, for instance, there is real jeopardy for Germany on their trip to Northern Ireland. Having already been surprised once in Slovakia they can ill afford a defeat in Belfast if they want to avoid the playoffs by finishing first.

The stakes are similarly high for Belgium, who face Wales on Monday with both sides battling to just catch up with Group J leaders North Macedonia, on whom they hold a game in hand. Lose in Cardiff and what is left of the Belgian golden generation would be facing a very tricky trip to Kazakhstan in November. Italy too will be fearing what comes with dropped points when they host Israel in Udine. Avoiding defeat would have Gennaro Gattuso's team set fare for a top two berth that has seemed in doubt at some stages of the cycle, but realistically only nine points from nine will give them a chance of overhauling Norway.

As ever, though, it is Africa that promises to deliver the greatest drama on the final days of its first phase. Cape Verde, the island nation of just over half a million people, can secure its first ever berth at a World Cup with a win over Eswatini. Meanwhile by far the most populous nation in the continent -- and one of its great footballing powers -- has an almighty struggle on its hands. Nigeria must beat Benin by two goals to have even a chance of a top two finish in Group C, something which may be enough for them to reach the second round qualifiers. Even with a win they could really do with a helping hand from Rwanda, who play in South Africa.

To make matters worse, Nigeria's journey to Uyo after a win in Lesotho was delayed by a cracked windscreen on their plane, leading to a grim 20 hours of disrupted flights and long waits. That is hardly optimal preparation for one of the biggest games the Super Eagles have played in years. 

Meanwhile in Asia, Qatar must make home advantage pay as they take on the United Arab Emirates in Al Rayyan knowing a defeat could well see them eliminated from the tournament they hosted in 2022. Given the controversy around them and Saudi Arabia hosting the fourth round phase of AFC qualifying, the pressure is certainly on Qatar. The coming days, then, will be pivotal in shaping the participants in the World Cup.

📈 Trending upwards: The USMNT look to be on the right path, writes Pardeep Cattry, as Pochettino marks his anniversary in charge of the national team.

⚖️ Winners and losers: Friday certainly proved to be a successful game for Balogun but what of McKennie and even Matt Turner?

A new $500 million federal program will help arm state and local governments against potential attacks, part of an increasing focus by tournament planners on securing airspace over stadiums.

The Trump administration is moving to fortify U.S. skies against potential drone threats ahead of next summer's World Cup and other marquee mega-events, casting the technology as necessary both to bolster security and to help outpace foreign competition for aviation technology.

The administration plans to launch a $500 million effort to support state and local governments as they develop anti-drone security strategies ahead of the soccer tournament being played across the U.S., Canada and Mexico, along with the United States' 250th anniversary and 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, according to Andrew Giuliani, director of the White House's FIFA World Cup 2026 Task Force.

The White House says the money will be available to all 50 states but put to particular use to secure the 104 soccer matches that will be played in American stadiums. Officials envision urban police departments using handheld tools to detect aircraft, then either disabling them via jamming technology or ordering them to return to their points of origin.

“Everybody from the governors to different commissioners of the police in these different cities to the stadium chief security officer say that this is something that they need in order to protect the [World Cup] sites,” Giuliani told POLITICO in an interview.

The program, which comes out of funds budgeted to the Department of Homeland Security by the One Big Beautiful Bill enacted in July, reflects growing concern within the White House and national security agencies about uncrewed aerial threats, especially at major events — from well-organized terrorists, criminal mischief-makers or just overeager amateurs unaware that the airspace has been closed.

The funding will further insert the White House into a controversial debate over which law enforcement officials should be able to intercept or disable drones. Currently only federal agencies can do so, and a House bill that would extend that capacity to local police appears stalled. The administration is exploring contingency plans that would allow the Justice Department to temporarily authorize state and local officials to take down rogue drones in the event that Congress fails to act.

“Drones are a disruptive technology. They have an amazing potential for both good and ill,” Seb Gorka, the National Security Council's senior director for counterterrorism, has said. “We will increase the enforcement of current laws to deter two types of individuals: evildoers and idiots — the clueless and the careless.”

In August, Gorka joined Giuliani to meet with representatives of the local-organizing committees in the 11 American cities that will host World Cup matches. Drones have become “a key part” of planning by the White House task force, said Giuliani. The leading security officer for FIFA, soccer's international governing body, has identified drones as the greatest security challenge for the 39-day tournament.

“Let's use the World Cup as the urgency, right?” said Giuliani, whose task force was formed in coordination with the National Security Council, DHS and Department of Justice and now meets daily to align federal and local security efforts. “In nine months, World Cup games are going to kick off, and there's no pushing that back. So let's get the equipment we need to make sure that it's as safe as possible.”

World Cup host cities already have access to a $625 million grant program, created by the One Beautiful Bill Act and now administered by DHS, to reimburse security costs related to tournament preparations. States and territories will soon receive guidance on how to apply for drone-security funds.

“There will be a certain minimal amount that's available for every state, whether or not they host World Cup games or America 250 events,” Giuliani said.

The U.S., Canada and Mexico held the first trilateral meeting on counter-drone coordination this summer in Mexico City despite differing legal frameworks across the three World Cup co-hosts.

“We're going to put our best practices forward and urge our co-hosts to come to the table with their best practices as well,” he said, “and see what ultimately are best practices for all three of the countries to move forward there.” 

Still, gaps in U.S. law remain a key obstacle. Under current federal rules, only the Justice and Homeland Security Departments have the authority to take down or intercept unmanned aircraft in unauthorized locations or otherwise considered a threat.

“DHS, FBI, the FAA, and the state, local, tribal and territorial law enforcement partners who will partner with them during the FIFA World Cup matches must be equipped with the resources and legal frameworks necessary to mitigate drone threats across all venues where airspace security risks are identified,” FIFA Chief Safety and Security Officer G.B. Jones told a House Homeland Security Committee hearing last month. “This includes matches, FIFA fan training sites and other large outdoor gatherings where drone threats may compromise safety and security.”

That concern has prompted competing efforts in state capitals and on Capitol Hill to clarify lines of responsibility between governmental authorities. In September, more than 30 governors urged Congress to pass legislation granting states the same drone mitigation powers as federal agencies. The House Transportation Committee has approved a bill that includes a pilot program that would do so at certain events, but it is unclear when that will head to the House floor.

Beyond the World Cup, the administration is tying drone policy to broader industrial and defense goals. In June, Trump signed executive orders to enhance airspace security, accelerate domestic drone innovation and expand commercial operations.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who has described drones as part of a “weapons-technology revolution,” has warned that they “are being used to smuggle deadly drugs, target our infrastructure and spy on U.S. defenses.”

All to know as Group C leaders Benin try to hold off a fast-finishing Nigeria for direct entry into the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Who: Nigeria vs Benin
What: CAF qualifiers for FIFA 2026 World Cup
Where: Godswill Akpabio International Stadium, Uyo, Nigeria
When: Tuesday at 6pm (16:00 GMT)

How to follow: We'll have all the build-up on Al Jazeera Sport from 13:00 GMT in advance of our live text commentary stream.

Nigeria host Benin in the final matchday of the FIFA World Cup 2026 Confederation of African Football (CAF) first round, looking to steal direct qualification for next year's tournament from the Group C leaders.

The Super Eagles' task is momentous: Benin lead them by three points and by two on goal difference, making the fixture a must-win for the Nigerians if they want to have any chance of qualification, either as the group winners or as the runners-up who could potentially compete in November's interconfederation playoff for a possible 10th African World Cup spot.

For Benin, the calculus is straightforward: win or draw against the three-time African champions and the Cheetahs make history and qualify for the World Cup finals for the first time. Even a loss against Nigeria – and if other Group C contenders South Africa draw or lose their final fixture – could still seal direct qualification for the team from the West African nation.

Here is all to know before the highly anticipated, final matchday showdown between Nigeria and Benin:

Late last month, Benin drew level with then-Group C leaders South Africa after they received a three-point deduction from FIFA for fielding an extra player in an earlier fixture and then took over the standings lead on Friday when Banfa Banfa played out a highly disappointing 0-0 draw against last-placed Zimbabwe on the ninth matchday.

Benin and Nigeria both won their matchday 9 fixtures on Friday, beating Rwanda (1-0) and Lesotho (2-1) respectively.

A Benin victory in Uyo would guarantee them a maiden World Cup appearance, while anything less could allow one of their two group rivals to leapfrog them.

Tuesday's matchday 10 fixtures are the final group matches and will be played at the same time.

The plane carrying the Nigeria team from South Africa to Uyo for their final World Cup qualifier was forced to make an emergency landing in Angola on Saturday, their media representatives said.

The aircraft took off from Polokwane in South Africa and made a scheduled refuelling stop in the Angolan capital, Luanda, before heading for southern Nigeria.

But 25 minutes into that journey, the pilot was forced to return to Luanda “after a heavy crack on the aircraft's windshield distorted what had started as a smooth flight”, the Super Eagles' representative said.

Last month, South Africa were stripped of three points in their World Cup qualifying campaign for fielding an ineligible player, denting their hopes of reaching next year's finals and handing a World Cup lifeline to the other Group C contenders, Benin and Nigeria.

FIFA said its disciplinary committee had found South Africa guilty of playing midfielder Teboho Mokoena in a 2-0 home win over Lesotho in March when he should have sat out the qualifier after two cautions in previous group games.

Lesotho have been awarded the match 3-0 and South Africa stripped of the points.

At the time of the announcement on September 29, South Africa were still top of the standings with 14 points, but only on goal difference from Benin with two games left. In the penultimate group fixtures, South Africa played out a draw and Benin won, enabling Benin (17) to lead Bafana Bafana (15) by two points with one matchday remaining.

Benin defeated Nigeria 2-1 in a FIFA World Cup fixture on June 10, 2024, at the Stade Felix Houphouet-Boigny in Abidjan, Ivory Coast.

Raphael Onyedika put Nigeria ahead in the 27th minute, but two Benin goals before half-time from Jodel Dossou and Steve Mounie's match-winner were enough to secure the three points for the Cheetahs.

African World Cup qualifying is arranged into nine groups of six nations.

The nine Confederation of African Football (CAF) group winners secure direct entry to the World Cup 2026, while the four best runners-up will participate in an intercontinental playoff for the possibility of securing a 10th spot at the tournament.

Of the nine African groups, five teams have already qualified for next year's World Cup finals in North America: Algeria, Egypt, Ghana, Morocco and Tunisia. The remaining four will be decided on Tuesday.

CAF World Cup 2026 qualification dates:

Nigeria recalled previously injured star forward Victor Osimhen for their last FIFA World Cup qualifying match against Lesotho on Friday, and he will be on the pitch against Benin on Tuesday.

Osimhen, who plays for Turkish giants Galatasaray, says Nigeria enter the must-win encounter as underdogs.

“Against Benin, we will be underdogs, and Benin are the favourite to win. Because we have been playing a bad game for our standards, it just doesn't come together,” he said.

“We cannot promise our fans much. But we will fight. This group keeps on giving – it doesn't stop. We hope it will be our turn to be on top on Tuesday if we play our part as players. I don't want to talk much about other things, but I am not happy [with] how we represent our country.”

In a big blow for coach Eric Chele, Ademola Lookman, the 2024 African Ballon d'Or winner, will be unavailable against Benin due to suspension.

Lookman, who plays for Italian club side Atalanta Bergamo, was booked for the second time in two matches in their 2-0 win against Lesotho on Friday, triggering a one-match ban for the talented forward.

Key defender Ola Aina will miss his second straight match for the Super Eagles as he recovers from an injury sustained against South Africa on September 9.

Chele will likely play his side in a 4-2-3-1 formation with Osimhen as the lone striker.

Coach Gernot Rohr will have a full squad available for selection against Nigeria.

Rohr regularly deploys a 4-2-3-1 formation with Mounie leading the line. Andreas Hountondji and Dossou will play key attacking roles just behind Mounie.

The backline of Tamimou Ouorou, Olivier Verdon, Yohan Roche and Mohamed Tijani is unchanged from their last match on Friday – a narrow 1-0 win over Rwanda in Kigali – with Marcel Dandjinou again the starting goalkeeper.

Nigeria have been to six FIFA World Cup finals but missed out on the most recent tournament in Qatar in 2022.

Nigeria: Nwabali (goalkeeper); Troost-Ekong, Fredrick, Bassey, Onyemaechi; Ndidi, Iwobi; Chukwueze, Simon; Osimhen, Arokodare

Benin: Dandjinou (goalkeeper); Ouorou, Verdon, Tijani, Roche; D'Almeida, Imourane; Dossou, Dokou, Hountondji; Mounie

Nigeria and Benin have played 12 times across all competitions since 2004.

Nigeria have won nine times, while Benin have two victories.

The sides have played out one draw.

Eric Chele, Nigeria head coach:

“The suspension [of Ademola Lookman] is unfortunate, but the team has the strength and character to win,” he said.

Gernot Rohr, Benin head coach:

“Yes, it will be a wonderful final in Uyo and it's in our hands [to qualify for a historic first World Cup finals], which is unimaginable when you see Nigeria and South Africa behind us,” he said.

“But all can change in one game, the last game. So we are very humble and we know that we have to do it again, and it will be more difficult in Nigeria than in Rwanda. We know this, of course.”

A European nation who have lost every single World Cup qualifier, could have a better chance of qualifying for the tournament if they suffer another defeat to Romania.

The smallest country in UEFA, San Marino are renowned as one of the worst nations in the history of international football and did not win a competitive fixture until September last year when they beat Liechenstein in the UEFA Nations League.

That victory came 34 years after their first official fixture, with all three of their wins coming against the same side.

Placed in Group H in World Cup qualifying, San Marino, whose team is predominantly semi-professional, have lost all seven of their fixtures - conceding 32 and scoring just one.

Advert

Roberto Cevoli's side, the lowest ranked side according to FIFA, lost 4-0 to Cyprus on Saturday but it's emerged that losing to Romania in their final fixture could lead to an unthinkable scenario.

Romania are third in the group, three points behind Bosnia and Herzegovina with one game remaining.

The two sides square off on 15 November, before Bosnia take on group leaders Austria a few days later when San Marino take on Romania.

Advert

Romania finishing second in Group H would see them qualify for the World Cup play-offs, where there will be a total of 16 teams.

12 will be second-placed teams, with a further four spots going to the four best-ranked UEFA Nations League group winners who have not already qualified.

Incredibly, San Marino did win their Nations League group in 2024/25 - topping group D1 in League D with seven points from four games against Gibraltar and Liechenstein.

That earned the minnows promotion to League C but also gives them a genuine outside chance of a historic World Cup appearance in the United States.

Romania also won their Nations League group, storming group C1 with maximum points from six games to secure promotion to Group B.

Therefore, in a bizarre turn of events, it is in San Marino's best interests to lose emphatically to Romania so that they take one of the play-off spots handed to Nations League winners.

Advert

This feat would not be particularly difficult for San Marino, who have been on the receiving end of many thrashings over the years.

They would then be set for two play-off matches against higher-ranked teams from the divisions above, where two wins would see them qualify for the tournament in North America next year.

Because of UEFA's system, San Marino may also sneak into the play-offs if Sweden or Northern Ireland finish in the top two of their groups as they too were Nations League group winners.

The impossible may be possible for San Marino, who have a chance of creating one of sport's greatest ever achievements.

However, a Bosnia win against Romania on 15 November could crush San Marino's dreams.

48 teams will qualify for the World Cup, 16 of which will be representing UEFA.

Heimir Hallgrimsson still believes his Republic of Ireland side can qualify for the World Cup next summer

Fifa World Cup qualifier: Republic of Ireland v Armenia

Venue: Aviva Stadium, Dublin Date: Tuesday, 14 October Kick-off: 19:45 BST

Coverage: Live text commentary on BBC Sport website

Manager Heimir Hallgrimsson says ""the result is the only thing that matters"" before the Republic of Ireland's crucial World Cup qualifier against Armenia in Dublin on Tuesday night. 

Hallgrimsson's side are bottom of Group F after defeats away by Tuesday's opponents and Portugal, with their solitary point coming in a home 2-2 draw with Hungary in September.

His team have the chance for redemption against Armenia, and they need to win to keep alive their slim hopes of reaching the World Cup.

""I believe in this team and I think this team has everything to qualify for the World Cup,"" Hallgrimsson said. 

""We are not favourites in the group at the moment but a win would change that, and I believe we are going to do that.

""The result is the only thing that matters - however we do it. This is a result game, 100%."" 

The Icelander has emphasised the importance of a fast start in front of the home crowd, taking the positives from an ultimately crushing defeat in Lisbon on Saturday.

After holding Portugal for the majority of the match, Ruben Neves eventually broke their defensive rear-guard with a 91st minute winner, with Hallgrimsson fully aware he will need to change his tactics for Tuesday's visit of Armenia.

""We knew once Portugal didn't score they would open up, they would be frustrated. And you saw that in their body language, they got more and more frustrated,"" Hallgrimsson continued. 

""Now we flip that psychology. We need to win the game and we cannot lose our focus in the beginning because we know the fact that we need to win the game, we need to be smart, have game management throughout the game.

""The goal can come in the 91st minute like in Portugal, but just keep on going. Don't go individual, stay collective both in attack and in defence.""

Hallgrimsson led his native Iceland to the 2018 World Cup finals, and despite the Republic of Ireland's poor start to the campaign he believes that one victory can transform their chances of reaching the tournament next summer.

""We know that Armenia are a very good team, so never, ever anyone here will underestimate Armenia. I think we realise it's going to be a big pressure on us tomorrow (Tuesday). 

""We just need to accept that. That reality is there is going to be a pressure on us to win the game. But I'm again saying it doesn't need to happen first minute. 

""We need to be smart against this team. If we're not smart, they can punish us, like they did in Armenia.""

Headings


                                        Rumours have been circulating on social media that sports governing body FIFA has dropped the United States as a co-host of the 2026 football World Cup because of US President Donald Trump's travel bans. In reality, FIFA hasn't made any such declaration and, indeed, has continued to refer to three hosts of the tournament: the United States, Canada and Mexico.                

Issued on: 13/10/2025 - 14:59

""It's official, FIFA has decided that the 2026 World Cup will not be held in the United States,” says the voiceover on a video posted on TikTok by the account Duck@news, which has since been shared more than 3,000 times. Numerous TikTok and Facebook accounts have been spreading this rumour that FIFA decided to drop the United States as a co-host of the tournament because of US President Donald Trump's travel bans and clampdown on immigration.

According to these posts, both team delegations and supporters are afraid of being kicked out of the country by the very active US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency and are starting to consider the United States as “unsafe”. The posts also claimed that several countries had announced their decision to boycott the World Cup.

In reality, while there is tension between FIFA and the US president, there has been no official declaration that the United States has been dropped as a co-host. 

In its last press release, published October 8, 2025, FIFA continues to refer to the United States as a co-host. “Hosting of the tournament will be shared between Canada, Mexico and the USA,” reads a subheading. 

A post from October 2 describes the ball designed specially for the tournament. 

“Iconography that represents each host country adorns the ball, with the maple leaf for Canada, an eagle for Mexico and a star for the United States, while gold embellishments pay tribute to the FIFA World Cup Trophy,” it reads.

The official calendar, which you can see on FIFA's website, confirms this information. Out of the 16 cities selected to host games, 11 are in the United States, ranging from Seattle to Miami. The World Cup final is set for July 19, 2026 in New York City's MetLife Stadium, one of the nation's largest stadiums. 

There is therefore no real basis for the social media posts claiming that the United States was kicked out of the World Cup organisation.

Trump is, however, facing accusations that he is using the World Cup as an instrument for his own political agenda. Trump announced that he would refuse access to the Iranian delegation for the World Cup draw to be held in the United States later this year. Back in June, he already announced that Iranian fans would not be allowed to travel to the United States due to, as Trump said, security concerns.

There are also fears that Trump may ban Brazilian fans from travelling to the United States, likely a decision made to put pressure on the government of Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. 

And within the United States, Trump has threatened to move World Cup games from cities he deems “unsafe”, including Seattle and San Francisco.

""[Seattle and San Francisco are] run by radical left lunatics who don't know what they're doing,” he said during a press conference held on September 26. “But we're going to make sure they're safe … If I think [a city] is not safe, we're going to move it out of that city.”

Seven of the 11 US host cities are run by a liberal mayor. Seattle, for example, is expecting more than 750,000 visitors and nearly 930 million dollars in economic benefits from the games scheduled there. 

FIFA, however, was quick to respond to Trump's statements and remind him that, at least when it comes to the World Cup, he's not in charge. 

""It's FIFA's tournament, FIFA's jurisdiction, FIFA makes those decisions,"" Victor Montagliani, the organisation's vice president, said during a conference in London on October 1. ""With all due respect to current world leaders, football is bigger than them and football will survive their regime and their government and their slogans. That's the beauty of our game, that it is bigger than any individual and bigger than any country.""

Chile will host an all-South American semi-final and the remaining European and African representatives at the youth football tournament, with the corresponding final four clash to be confirmed on Sunday (12 October).

The South American party continues at the 2025 FIFA men's U-20 World Cup (27 September - 19 October) in Chile.

Into the final week of the youth men's football tournament, the road to crown the latest under-20 world champions is reaching its climax. The quarter-finals concluded on Sunday (12 October) ahead of the semi-finals kicking off on Wednesday (15 October).

Colombia and Argentina were the first nations to book their spots in the final four, making for an enticing all-South American matchup and guaranteeing CONMEBOL representation in the final on 19 October.

The Colombians came through a thrilling quarter-final clash by winning 3-2 against Spain, the top-ranked men's senior side and reigning Olympic champions.

Neyser Villareal put them ahead in the first half, before a quickfire Spanish double from Jan Virgili and Rayane Belaid turned the game on its head shy of the hour mark. Up stepped Neyser, Millonarios' talismanic striker, to equalise before securing his hat-trick with an 89th minute winner to send Colombia through.

In the other quarter-final, record champions Argentina dispatched Mexico 2-0 at Santiago's Estadio Nacional Julio Martínez Prádanos. Maher Carrizo broke the deadlock inside 10 minutes for the Albiceleste, an advantage they maintained going into the break.

Soon after the restart, Mateo Silvetti pounced on a loose ball to slot home to double the Argentine advantage. Mexico had no answer and ended the affair with nine men, after Diego Ochoa and Tahiel Jiménez were given their marching orders.

The semi-final lineup was set in stone on Sunday (12 October), as Africa's remaining representatives Morocco will meet 2013 champions France in Valparaíso. In a 3-1 win over the USA, the young Atlas Lions took the lead through Fouad Zahouani, only for it to be cancelled out by Cole Campbell's first-half penalty.

An own goal restored Morocco's lead in the 67th minute, before Gessime Yassine's late strike sealed the deal for the African nation. This is the first time since 2015 that a side from Africa has reached the semi-finals, since Mali and Senegal.

Morocco will meet France, who, after a dramatic round of 16 victory against Japan, had a more comfortable passage into the final four by defeating Norway 2-1.

A first-half brace from 19-year-old Saïmon Bouabré put Les Bleus in cruise control, and from then on it was about maintaining that grip. Rasmus Holten's 83rd minute goal proved to be no more than a consolation, as Norway suffered their first defeat of the tournament at the expense of France's progression.

""We are not collecting the most talented players, we are trying to build a team. Teams win trophies, no-one else."" If anyone was in any doubt as to whether England manager Thomas Tuchel planned to stick to his fairly unpopular selection policy with the World Cup fast approaching, those pointed words ahead of the friendly victory over Wales more or less confirmed it.

To date, the German tactician's tenure has been punctuated by questionable calls on who deserves a place in his squad, with a number of in-form hopefuls overlooked and the likes of Jordan Henderson and Ruben Loftus-Cheek surprisingly ushered back in from the international wilderness.

""That's how it is in international football,"" the Three Lions' boss continued. ""But the thing you are playing [back to me] is not what I am saying. You are playing the game that says: 'He (Tuchel) is saying the others who aren't in the team, you cannot build a team with them'. It's not like this. We built a team with the players who were available and they did so well so we go again with them. Nobody said we can't do the same with them. Or even better, or maybe the same level, with the others.""

However, Tuchel's determination to stick with the same group in October that impressed him in the September international break has led to more controversial snubs, with some of the country's biggest names left out with only a handful of games remaining before England, barring an absolute catastrophe in those final qualification matches, will be lining up at the World Cup in North America next summer.

""For this moment we stick with our choice and the radical statement is that we don't collect the most talented players,"" the manager continued. ""We collect the guys who have the glue and cohesion to be the best team. Because we need to arrive as the best team. We will arrive as underdogs at the World Cup because we haven't won it for decades and we will play against teams who have repeatedly won it during that time. So we have to arrive as a team or we will have no chance.""

Brazil endured their worst qualification campaign ever for the 2026 World Cup, finishing fifth in the CONMEBOL standings on just 28 points from 18 matches. The Selecao lost home and away to arch-rivals Argentina, with a 4-1 drubbing at the Estadio Monumental ultimately costing Dorival Junior his job as manager, and they were also handily beaten by Uruguay, Colombia, Paraguay and Bolivia. But hope for the 2026 finals remains high, with Carlo Ancelotti now holding the reins for the most successful national team in history.

The fact is, Brazil still qualified comfortably, finishing ahead of Paraguay on goal difference to secure an automatic top-six spot, with Bolivia eight points further back in seventh. There are also similarities to be drawn with their journey to South Korea and Japan in 2002, where Brazil picked up only 30 qualifying points, but still stormed to their fifth World Cup by winning all seven of their tournament matches while scoring 18 goals.

Back then, the firepower provided by Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, and Rivaldo proved too much for any opponent. Head coach Luis Felipe Scolari was the envy of all his international counterparts because of the attacking quality at his disposal. And next summer, when the tournament takes place across the United States, Canada and Mexico, Ancelotti may well be in the same position.

This iteration of Brazil doesn't have a single player who can quite match any of the three Rs for individual brilliance, but they arguably have even greater strength in depth up top. Fresh evidence of that was provided in the 5-0 friendly demolition of South Korea on Friday, with Chelsea wonderkid Estevao Willian and Rodrygo each bagging a brace before Vinicius Jr got in on the act.

Defensively, there are still flaws to be ironed out, but if Ancelotti can strike the right balance at the top end of the pitch, they could be rendered moot. Brazil's fear factor is slowly returning and so too is the 'joga bonito' style that has set them apart so often down the years.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

It's been a memorable world-wind trip to the Rolex Shanghai Masters for Melanie-Antoinette de Massy, president of the Monegasque Tennis Federation, Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters and the Monte-Carlo Country Club.

De Massy arrived in Shanghai at midday Friday after a 20-hour trip from Monaco with Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters tournament director David Massey.

On Saturday, de Massy sat in Valentin Vacherot's guest box along with Massey to see her countryman defeat four-time Rolex Shanghai Masters champion and World No. 5 Novak Djokovic. Twenty-four hours later, de Massy was back in Vacherot's box to see history being made as the 26-year-old rallied from a set down to defeat his cousin Arthur Rinderknech 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 and become the first player from Monaco in the Open Era to win an ATP Tour singles title.

""I am so, so proud of him and there's really no words that come to mind to describe really the feelings throughout the match,"" said de Massy. ""He played incredibly well and the match was fantastic. We saw really some amazing points, fantastic tennis and I'm so glad to be here. I'm so glad to live this moment with him and so happy to see this historical final.""

De Massy's phone has been receiving nonstop messages from well wishers back home as well as interview requests. Avid tennis fan  Prince Albert II of Monaco followed closely Vacherot's historic run in Shanghai and was messaging de Massy before and during the championship match.

During the final, de Massy said she received several WhatsApp messages from Prince Albert II and afterwards he spoke to her along with Vacherot.

""We spoke for 10 to 15 minutes after the match and he was so thrilled, then Prince Albert spoke to Val for about 10 minutes,"" said de Massy, who received close to 100 messages after the final. ""He was very touched by Val's words in the award ceremony and was proud of Val's results. The Prince gave interviews to the local press and congratulated the work of the Federation. The whole country is proud.""

There was a watch party at the Monte-Carlo Country Club with members and many of the top junior players in Monaco. The marketplace showed the match at 10:30 in the morning on a massive screen that was organised by the Monaco Town Hall, similar to what is done for the Formula 1 race in Monte-Carlo.

""I turned on my phone, but I haven't really watched anything yet,"" said Vacherot. ""I can't wait to watch the videos, especially at the Monte-Carlo Country Club. I knew they had a big watch party. Because it's Sunday, everyone is off work, so I think this probably the day there is the most people.""

Shortly after the final ended, Vacherot draped the Monaco flag over his shoulders before the award ceremony began. He reflected on his historic achievement and what it means for his country.

""Just to hold the flag, and to be able to do that for my country is, it's unreal, of course,"" said Vacherot, who climbed from No. 204 to No. 40 in the PIF ATP Rankings. ""I'm just thinking about our little federation, our little small country, one of the smallest countries in the world. Probably the smallest federation. We have such, we have not many players, and now we have one Masters 1000 in singles, two Masters 1000 titles in doubles with Hugo Nys — also one Grand Slam final for Hugo in the Australian Open two years ago — and what we get to achieve for Monaco is unbelievable. I hope that we're making everyone proud of us, and I hope just to keep going.""

Nys is ranked No. 19 in doubles and has been a career-high No. 12 in June 2023. He won his biggest title at ATP Masters 1000 Rome that year and also was a finalist at the Australian Open in 2023. Romain Arneodo, a winner of two doubles titles this season, is ranked No. 45 in doubles after reaching a career-high No. 38 in August.

Earlier this year at the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters in April, French-born Monegasque player Arneodo made history by winning the doubles title with Frenchman Manuel Guinard. Arneodo became the first Monegasque player to win the Monte-Carlo doubles title. 

""For Monaco it's absolutely extraordinary and we've never had a Monaco-born player in the Top 100 in singles,"" said de Massy. ""We've had, as Valentin said at the end of his semi-final match — and I really appreciated that he did that — is to remind everyone that in tennis there's singles, but there's also doubles, and we have extraordinary double players. In Monaco we love playing Davis Cup because we love being a team, we love being all together and with Monaco Tennis Federation — and Monaco tennis as a whole actually, whether it's the tournament, the federation, or the club — is one big family.""

Half-brother and coach Benjamin Balleret instilled the belief in Valentin that he would break into the Top 100 and then take it to a higher level.

""When we were putting goals for Val it was not only Top 100, because it seems a little, like, 'Oh, for some guys, we just want to be Top 100',"" said Balleret, who ranked a career-high No. 204 in 2006. ""No, it's like, 'Let's go. We want to be Top 50, Top 30'. You have more, even more ambition. So our role as the coach and all the team is to be behind him and to push him and to tell him that he believes that he can be a top-50 player. Because I think so many players stop believing.""

Holger Rune and Daniil Medvedev kept themselves in Nitto ATP Finals contention with positive showings at the Rolex Shanghai Masters. ATPTour.com looks at the movers of the week in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin as of Monday 13 October.



Holger Rune – 12th (2,490 points), +2
The Dane has climbed two spots to 12th in the Live Race after he reached the quarter-finals in Shanghai. Rune earned three wins at the ATP Masters 1000 event to close to 945 points of eighth-placed Lorenzo Musetti, who is in the final qualification spot. Rune, who competes in Stockholm this week, qualified for Turin in 2023. Rune will need an impressive final month of the season if he is to return to Italy in November, but he has found his best level on the indoor hard courts before, winning his maiden Masters 1000 title in Paris in 2022.

The Australian consolidated his seventh-placed position after advancing to the quarter-finals in Shanghai. De Minaur recorded his 50th tour-level victory of the season at the event. It is the first time the 26-year-old has earned 50 wins in a season. He will next compete at the ATP 500 event in Vienna, which begins on Monday 20 October.

Daniil Medvedev – 15th (2,360), +5
Medvedev kept alive his faint chances of qualifying by reaching the semi-finals in Shanghai, beating De Minaur en route to improve to 8-4 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series. The 29-year-old has competed at the year-end event for the past six years, lifting the trophy in 2020. He will hope to gain more points this week in Almaty, where he is the second seed at the ATP 250 event.

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have already qualified for the Nitto ATP Finals, taking place from 9-16 November at Inalpi Arena in Turin.

Gabriel Diallo has fond memories at the Almaty Open, having reached his first ATP Tour final at the event last year. On Monday, the seventh-seeded Canadian made an impressive start to his latest campaign at the ATP 250, dispatching wild card Amir Omarkhanov 6-3, 6-1.

In a dominant performance, Diallo won 93 per cent (25/27) of his first-serve points, according to Infosys ATP Stats, and did not face a break point to advance after just 62 minutes. Diallo won his maiden tour-level trophy in ‘s-Hertogenbosch earlier this season and will aim to add to that triumph in Almaty, where he next meets James Duckworth after the Australian qualifier downed Ugo Blanchet 6-3, 6-4.



In other Day 1 action, Fabian Marozsan beat Luca Nardi 7-6(3), 6-3. The No. 52 player in the PIF ATP Rankings recovered from squandering a 5-3 lead in the first set and now leads the Italian 3-0 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series. Marozsan has recorded 25 wins this year and is the third Hungarian man to reach that milestone in a season, joining Balazs Taroczy and Marton Fucsovics.

Frenchman Corentin Moutet advanced, overcoming Bernard Tomic 6-1, 7-6(9). The lefty reached the semi-finals at the hard-court event in Washington earlier this season.

Ekaterina Alexandrova has become the third player this season to break into the Top 10 in the PIF WTA Rankings for the first time.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla -- Ekaterina Alexandrova on Monday broke into the Top 10 on the PIF WTA Rankings for the first time in her career following an outstanding 12 months on the Hologic WTA Tour.

Alexandrova secured her rise to sit within the elite ranking bracket courtesy of reaching three WTA 500 finals this season, triumphing at the Upper Austria Ladies Linz and posting runner-up finishes at the Abierto GNP Seguros (Monterrey) and Korea Open Tennis Championships presented by Motiva (Seoul).

She's also posted 40-plus Tour level match-wins in a single season for the first time and further demonstrated her consistency by reaching the Round of 16 at three of the four Grand Slams in 2025, at Roland Garros, Wimbledon and the US Open.

Alexandrova's fine season has also been highlighted by scoring her second win over the reigning PIF WTA World No.1, defeating Aryna Sabalenka at the Qatar TotalEnergies Open (Doha).

Naomi Osaka dominates in her return to the Kinoshita Group Japan Open, defeating Sonobe in straight sets. Seeking a quarterfinal spot, Osaka will face defending champion Lamens next. After recent successes, Osaka looks to regain momentum in Asia.

Four-time Grand Slam champion and top seed Naomi Osaka advanced to the second round of the Kinoshita Group Japan Open on Monday with a 6-0, 6-4 win over countrywoman Wakana Sonobe, who received a wild card into the main draw.

Playing in the event for the first time since 2017, Osaka opened strongly, taking the first set 6-0. She broke Sonobe in the sixth game of the second set and held serve to close out the match in 1 hour and 16 minutes.

Next Up is defending champion Lamens

The 27-year-old Japanese player is seeking her first quarterfinal appearance in Osaka. She will face defending champion Suzan Lamens of the Netherlands in the second round. Osaka leads Lamens 1-0 in their head-to-head series, winning in 's-Hertogenbosch on grass in straight sets last year.

Looking to Regain Momentum in Asia

After reaching the final in Montreal and the semifinals at the US Open to climb back into the world's Top 20, Osaka has struggled to maintain her winning form in Asia. She managed just one victory across Beijing and Wuhan before arriving in Osaka this week.

In another first-round match on Monday, sixth seed Olga Danilovic defeated local wild card Nao Hibino 6-4, 1-6, 6-2.

Even though she didn't come away with the title, Iga Swiatek still had a strong showing in Wuhan last week, reaching the milestone 25th WTA 1000 quarterfinal of her career—she also completed her career set of WTA 1000 quarterfinals, with Wuhan having been the only one missing.But with her $83,250 prize money cheque for reaching the quarterfinals in Wuhan, she now achieves something very big, surpassing Venus Williams for the second-most career prize money in WTA history.Swiatek went into the WTA 1000 event with $42,862,240 and leaves with $42,945,490, edging past Venus' career haul of $42,867,364 and now trailing only Serena Williams' all-time women's record of $94,816,730.

Iconic Carlos Sainz onboards

From the Drivers' Championship heating up, to George Russell looking to back up his Singapore win – here are the big stories ahead of the United States Grand Prix.

The final quarter of the 2025 season is upon us, as the Formula 1 paddock heads to Austin to kick-off a double-header in the Americas that also includes Mexico City. With the Drivers' Championship picture getting tighter and multiple teams fighting for wins, it's set to be a big weekend at Circuit of The Americas...

Ahead of the Singapore Grand Prix, we were asking if Max Verstappen is really a threat in the Drivers' Championship picture, and another weekend where he beat both of the McLarens to further cut the gap would suggest that he is.

That said, Verstappen being limited to second place ahead of Lando Norris in third and Oscar Piastri in fourth meant he was only able to reduce Piastri's lead by six points, leaving him 63 adrift with six rounds to go.

Zoom out a little, and Verstappen has taken 41 points out of Piastri in the past three races, so the trend is a strong one, but the two McLaren drivers will still have their eyes predominantly on each other at this stage. In fact, they got so close in Singapore there was light contact on the opening lap, leading to the post-race focus being on the rules of engagement between the pair.

Norris came out on top on that occasion to move within a race win of Piastri – 22 points back now – and with a double-header of Austin and Mexico City ahead, as we saw in 2024 the picture could change quickly.

Drivers' standings after Singapore

George Russell delivered an extremely impressive weekend in Singapore, producing two laps that were good enough for pole position in Q3, and then controlling the race from the front after a strong getaway.

The Mercedes wasn't able to escape a huge distance up the road from the likes of Verstappen and Norris behind, but on a track where controlling tyre temperatures could have proven problematic, it was an encouraging performance from Toto Wolff's team.

Although Mercedes have warned not to expect similar results on every circuit between now and the end of the year, trackside engineering director Andrew Shovlin admits “hopefully we're seeing a progressive trend” when it comes to more competitive showings in different conditions.

That could open the door for more big results for Russell, who goes into the Austin weekend still waiting for his new contract at Mercedes to be finalised. While both sides insist it is only a matter of time and that the line-up of Russell and Kimi Antonelli will be retained in 2026, the longer the situation drags on, the more it becomes a talking point.

We might be entering the final quarter of the 2025 season, but for a lot of teams there is already significant focus on 2026. That's due to the major change in technical and power unit regulations, which also means there has been plenty going on behind the scenes when it comes to two major brands preparing to enter.

From a team perspective, this will be the first American race since Cadillac confirmed their driver line-up for next year. Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez will race for the American team, with Colton Herta one of the test drivers, and those were some of the biggest announcements among many.

The first running of an old car to help get the newest race team sharp is expected next month, but there are plenty of other areas Cadillac is still developing, and further plans for the project could well be discussed through any presence the team has in Austin.

Similar could be said of Ford, too, who are just a few months away from being back in F1 alongside Red Bull. Ford are offering expertise in partnership with Laurent Mekies' team on the powertrain front, and have been working hard for a number of years already to prepare for the new regulations.

On top of the coming race weekend, American-based fans have plenty to get excited about for the future as involvement continues to grow.

There is only a quarter of the season left, but with three Sprint events included in the final six rounds, there are more than a quarter of the year's points still up for grabs.

An extra 24 points could be scored if one driver were to win all three of the Sprint races on a Saturday – just one point shy of an entire extra race victory – and Circuit of The Americas is the first of the remaining Sprint rounds, with Brazil and Qatar to follow.

Where the Sprint adds an extra level of jeopardy for the teams is in the reduction of practice time, with just one hour in FP1 on Friday before the Sprint Qualifying session later in the day. That means arriving with a strong baseline set-up and hitting the ground running is crucial if you want to score points in both races.

The United States Grand Prix on Sunday is where the big return is, but at this stage of the season the added opportunity to pick up points feels like it carries that little bit more weight, particularly for any teams or drivers looking to continue recent momentum.

The United States Grand Prix has evolved into one of the largest events on the Formula 1 calendar since it joined the schedule back in 2012. And perhaps we shouldn't be surprised given the Texas tradition of making everything bigger.

The extra points mentioned above are on offer at a race weekend that regularly attracts over 400,000 spectators and could set its own new attendance record this year, as fans descend on Austin to soak up the F1 atmosphere alongside an eclectic city vibe.

And those fans get to see 20 of the best drivers in the world tackle a racetrack that has earned a reputation for being a bit of a modern classic. A number of the drivers rate Circuit of The Americas as one of their favourite tracks in the sport, with a high-speed first sector that pushes an F1 car to its limits, followed by long straights and heavy braking zones that also encourage overtaking.

Turn 1 is now one of the most recognisable on the calendar, with cars climbing a steep incline to a wide hairpin in front of tens of thousands of fans, and then plunging back downhill into that thrilling opening sequence of corners. It really is a spectacular venue, and has given us plenty of excitement both on and off the track.

Swift announced the new concert movie and six-episode look behind the scenes on Monday morning.



		By Nicole Fell, Jackie Strause 

	October 13, 2025 5:33am	




Taylor Swift‘s full concert film The Eras Tour | The Final Show, featuring the entire Tortured Poets Department set, and a docuseries on the tour are coming to streaming. The movie and the first two episodes of the docuseries, Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The End of an Era, release on Disney+ on Dec. 12.


	Swift announced the news, including the six-episode behind-the-scenes docuseries, on her socials Monday morning. 




	“It was the End of an Era and we knew it. We wanted to remember every moment leading up to the culmination of the most important and intense chapter of our lives, so we allowed filmmakers to capture this tour and all the stories woven throughout it as it wound down. And to film the final show in its entirety,” she wrote on Instagram.

	Two episodes of the docuseries will release weekly following the Dec. 12 release. The news comes on the heels of the record-breaking release of her latest album, The Life of a Showgirl, on Oct. 3.


	Boasting unprecedented access to her record-breaking tour, docuseries Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The End of an Era will chronicle the development, impact and inner-workings that created the phenomenon that was The Eras Tour.


	The docuseries will give “an intimate look at Taylor's life as her tour made headlines and thrilled fans around the world,” per Disney. The series will spotlight performers, family members and Swift's friends — including Gracie Abrams, Sabrina Carpenter, Ed Sheeran and Florence Welch — to offer “never-before-seen insight into what it took to create a phenomenon.”

	











	The full concert film The Eras Tour | The Final Show was filmed in Vancouver to capture the final show of the tour.


Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The End of an Era is directed by Don Argott, co-directed by Sheena M. Joyce and produced by Object & Animal. Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The Final Show is directed by Glenn Weiss and produced by Taylor Swift Productions in association with Silent House Productions.      


The Life of a Showgirl, produced and written by the singer herself along with hitmakers Max Martin and Shellback, was thought to be a return to some of her most standard pop albums, like 1989, but instead leaned more towards a mix of Evermore and Midnights. Swift said the rollout of the album — lead by the single “The Fate of Ophelia” — has “absolutely” been her favorite yet, calling it the “most joyful” of her career in a recent interview.


	The album sold 2.7 million copies on release day (Oct. 3), making that day alone her largest week ever, according to Luminate via Billboard. On Oct. 8, with over a full day of tracking left, Swift officially took the record for biggest opening week so far for a record in the streaming era, according to Billboard, with data sourced from Luminate. As of Wednesday, she had sold a reported 3.2 million copies with 300,000 streaming units, taking her to a record-breaking 3.5 million combined. The album is expected to be her 15th No. 1 on Billboard 200; however, the official chart has yet to be released.

	











	The singer has been making the rounds on late night TV for Showgirl. She stopped by The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon last week to talk about the album, her recent engagement to Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and her pal Selena Gomez's wedding. The NBC late night show opted to air an extended version of Swift's appearance as a special episode on Oct. 10. The “Father Figure” singer also stopped by NBC's Late Night with Seth Meyers on Oct. 8. She was the night's only guest — the show dubbed it a “Tay/kover” episode.


	In addition to the album, Swift released a cinematic companion, which included a chance to see the lead single's music video early. Swift directed the video, which was filmed by frequent collaborator and Oscar-nominated cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, and features choreography from famed choreographer Mandy Moore, who worked on the singer's Eras tour. The release event — not fully classified as a film or a documentary — earned $34.1 million at the opening weekend domestic box office and an additional $16 million worldwide, bringing its grand total to $50.1 million globally.


Oct. 13, 10 a.m. This story has been updated with final box office tally.

Martin Clunes will appear on the series, which is based on his long-running British dramedy. 


							By 

	Rick Porter


Television Business Editor


Fox's midseason series Best Medicine is based on the beloved British show Doc Martin. The show's latest casting will make the connection even more concrete.


	Martin Clunes, who played the title character on Doc Martin, has signed on for a guest role in Best Medicine — though not as the British doctor he played for 10 seasons spanning almost 20 years. Instead, Clunes will play Dr. Robert Best, the father of lead character Dr. Martin Best (Josh Charles). 




	Robert is an accomplished but headstrong gastroenterologist whose demeanor makes Martin's prickly bedside manner seem warm by comparison. He arrives in the New England town where Martin has moved after giving up his surgical career in Boston and puts everyone on edge, including his estranged sister and Martin's aunt (Annie Potts). “But underneath his snobby, stone-cold exterior,” the character descripition reads, “Robert is hiding a few secrets of his own that could turn Martin's new life upside down, and force him to confront his past.”

	Fox Entertainment studios produces Best Medicine. Liz Tuccillo executive produces with Ben Silverman, Rodney Ferrell and Howard T. Owens of Propagate Content and Doc Martin EPs Marc Crowdy and Philippa Braithwaite. 


	Along with Doc Martin, Clunes' credits include the BBC's Men Behaving Badly, ITV's Manhunt (which streamed on Acorn TV in the U.S.) and a 2018 miniseries adaptation of Vanity Fair. He'll next be seen in Emerald Fennell's Wuthering Heights feature film.

The ""vibrant new identity"" was announced in a press release for the 'F1' movie.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


Apple is rebranding its Apple TV+ streaming service, giving the platform a “vibrant new identity” as, simply, Apple TV.


	The company buried the news in its announcement Monday morning about the premiere date for the film F1, which will debut on the platform Dec. 12.




	When Apple launched Apple TV+, the name Apple TV had already been taken by its connected TV box, which functions similar to a Roku or Apple Fire TV device, providing access to other streaming services.


	In the F1 release, which announced the debut date, the company wrote that “Apple TV+ is now simply Apple TV, with a vibrant new identity.”

	It was not immediately clear when the new identity would go into effect. As of writing Monday, the app still showed Apple TV+ badging. Apple had previously raised the price of the streaming service by more than 30 percent back in August, rising to $12.99 per month, up from $9.99. It is worth noting that Apple TV is the only major streaming service that does not have an advertising-supported tier.


	The new name could be a prelude to larger changes, either with the physical Apple TV device, or for Apple TV+. There has been speculation in the advertising world in recent months that Apple could follow Netflix and others in offering an ad-based tier both to improve the profitability, and to provide options for consumers.

Caitríona Balfe and John Turturro also star in director Sean Ellis' feature that will make its streaming debut on Paramount+ after premiering at TIFF.


							By 

	Ryan Gajewski


Senior Entertainment Reporter


Orlando Bloom‘s boxing feature is set to enter the ring with its streaming debut. 


	Director Sean Ellis's movie The Cut is set for its post-theatrical launch via Paramount+ on Nov. 1, The Hollywood Reporter has exclusively learned. Republic Pictures gave the film a limited theatrical release last month following its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2024. 




The Cut centers on an Irish boxer (Bloom) who has picked up a job at his hometown gym after his fighting career stalled. When an opportunity arises to once again prove himself in the ring, he turns to extreme measures to rapidly cut down his weight.

Caitríona Balfe, John Turturro, Gary Beadle and Clare Dunne round out the cast. Ellis (The Cursed) helmed the film from a script by Justin Bull, with Mark Lane credited for the story. Producers include Bloom, Lane, Leonora Darby, James Harris, Adam Karasick, Bret Saxon and Thomas Fanning.


	Bloom was seen earlier this year in the Amazon MGM Studios action-comedy Deep Cover. He is set to appear opposite Pete Davidson and Naomi Scott in David Michôd's Wizards!


	During a previous interview with THR, Bloom explained what he looks for in roles at this stage of his career. 


	“I feel like in some ways, I was almost being groomed to be a movie star when I was younger, and now all bets are off,” Bloom said at the time. “I want to burn the barn down with my performance. I'm not afraid of anything anymore. If there's a role, and it's going to terrify me because I'll be challenged in some way, that's what I want to do.”

The actress was asked about signing onto the new full-cast Harry Potter audiobook series. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


	Keira Knightley was asked about signing onto an upcoming Harry Potter project during a recent publicity stop. 


	The actress was promoting her new Netflix thriller The Woman in Cabin 10 when she was questioned about playing a role in the lavish new audiobook productions of the Harry Potter novels, Harry Potter: The Full-Cast Audio Editions. 



	The production has cast more than 200 actors to play roles in the new adaptation of J.K. Rowlings' beloved bestsellers, with Knightley playing the villainous Ministry of Magic authoritarian Dolores Umbridge.

Decider asked the British actress if she was aware that “some fans are calling for a boycott” given Rowling's trans views.


	“I was not aware of that, no,” she said. “I'm very sorry. You know, I think we're all living in a period of time right now where we're all going to have to figure out how to live together, aren't we? And we've all got very different opinions. I hope that we can all find respect.”


The Woman in Cabin 10 filmmaker Simon Stone was in the interview with Knightley and weighed in as well.


	“I think that's right,” Stone said. “I think that we have learned over time, unfortunately, that the unbearable voice in the room is something … I think everyone needs to recognize that they're the unbearable voice for someone else, as well. The live and let live thing of like, ‘Oh God, your voice is really loud, and I can't stand you.' That's part of our lives.”

	











	He continued: “We all have hatred, deep hatred for someone in the universe—someone in the class. Let's reduce it to classroom politics. There is always the kid that we cannot stand. I think we'd all agree that we're that kid for someone else, too. Unfortunately, all sides of the political spectrum are currently trying to shut that kid's voice down, but they don't realize the irony of the fact that they're also that kid for someone else. If we can have all have a moratorium on that, and just let chaos live for a little bit, we might find our way out.” 


	While Rowling's views continue to be a topic of debate online, the Harry Potter universe has not shown any sign of being impacted by the controversy. The 2023 Hogwarts Legacy game was a massive bestseller and anticipation for HBO's upcoming Harry Potter TV series is quite high. Rowling's recent clap back on Harry Potter film star Emma Watson's apparent attempt to extend an olive branch to the author drew praise in some conservative quarters, condemnation in others, after Rowling wrote that Watson “has so little experience of real life she's ignorant of how ignorant she is.” 


The Woman in Cabin 10 is based on a novel by Ruth Ware and follows “a journalist (Knightley) on a luxury yacht who witnesses a passenger thrown overboard late at night, only to be told that it didn't happen, as all passengers and crew are accounted for. Despite no one believing her, she continues to look for answers, putting her own life in danger.” The film is currently streaming on Netflix.

The Formula One pic was the sleeper hit of the summer and is the first major box win for Apple Original Films .


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	The release date of filmmaker F1: The Movie on streamer Apple TV has finally been revealed after the sleeper hit took the summer box office by storm on its way to becoming the the top-grossing sports film of all time, among other records. It's also the first major theatrical win for the tech giant's movie division.


	Directed by Joseph Kosinski and starring Brad Pitt, the pic will become available on streaming service Apple TV around the globe on Dec. 12, Apple Original Films announced Monday. (Apple TV is going through a major rebranding, having previously been known as Apple TV+.)

	Legacy Hollywood studios continue to be suspicious of a streamer's commitment to a traditional theatrical window, but Apple and Amazon MGM Studios are vowing to give certain event films a proper theatrical window in hopes of boosting a movie's visibility, versus sending a title straight to streaming in hopes of luring new subscribers or stop existing subs from bolting.


	Apple Original Films certainly lived up to its word when it came to F1, which opened in theaters at the end of June and is among the top-10 grossing pics of the year with more than $629 million in worldwide ticket sales. The pic broke numerous records — including becoming the the top-grossing live-action film of Brad Pitt's career, not adjusted for inflation. The earned an A CinemaScore, along with a coveted 97 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes.


	“It's been thrilling to see audiences around the world embrace F1 The Movie 'in theaters,” Jerry Bruckheimer, the film's producer,” said in a statement. “Now, we're beyond excited to bring this exhilarating, cinematic ride to fans everywhere through Apple TV's unparalleled global reach. Partnering with Apple and Formula 1 has been an incredible journey, and we're proud that even more viewers, from every corner of the world, will get to experience the heart-pounding action and passion

	











	Damson Idris, Kerry Condon, Tobias Menzies, Kim Bodnia, and Javier Bardem also star in the big-budget tentpole, which was shot during actual Grand Prix weekends as the team competed against the titans of the sport. The film is produced by Bruckheimer, Kosinski, seven-time Formula world champion Lewis Hamilton, Pitt, Dede Gardner, Jeremy Kleiner and Chad Oman. Kosinski directed from a screenplay by Ehren Kruger, based on story by Kosinski and Kruger.  


	Apple Original Films partnered with Warner Bros., with the latter distributing and helping to market the film around the globe.


	Ahead of its debut on Apple TV, the film continues to be available for digital ownership on participating digital platforms, including AppleTV, Amazon Prime Video, Fandango At Home, and more. Beyond the box office, the F1 The Album soundtrack has seen 600,000 albums sold worldwide, and is nearing one billion global streams. Currently dominating Billboard's Top Movie Songs chart with seven of the top ten tracks, the album is powered by Tate McRae's two-time VMA-nominated smash hit “Just Keep Watching.” With over four billion views across short-form video platforms, the album has become a defining music moment of 2025 and a crucial part of the film's cultural impact, Apple noted in its release.

	Gil Kaufman



	The Taylor Swift blitz will continue into the holiday season. After making the rounds over the past two weeks to promote her just-released, record-smashing 12 studio album, The Life of a Showgirl, the singer has a few more surprises up her sleeve for Swifties to round out 2025. Swift announced on Good Morning America on Monday morning (Oct. 13) that she will be back on our screens in December via a pair of Disney+ Eras Tour specials.

Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The End of an Era is described as a six-episode behind-the-scenes docuseries chronicling the “development, impact, and inner-workings” behind the record-breaking career retrospective world tour. In addition, Swift will also drop Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The Final Show, a full concert film featuring the Eras Tour debut of the Tortured Poets Department. Both specials will begin streaming on Disney+ only on Dec. 12.

	











	“People like to talk about phenomenons,” Swift says in a promo video for the movies posted on Instagram on Monday morning in which she is seen getting ready to take the stage in one of her many Eras outfits, as well as rehearsing and sharing a sweet moment with her mom backstage. “Almost as if it were pieces falling into place. As if it just happened. The Eras Tour wasn't when all the pieces fell into place. This tour was just when every single one of us who had done so much work, pushing inch-by-inch, to where we all clicked together,” she continues in what appears to be a back-stage pump-up message for her team.




	In between, we see glimpses of the tour stage being built and fiancé Travis Kelce rehearsing his cameo at a London show at Wembley Stadium during which he carried the singer on stage during the “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart” transition. “The only thing left,” Swift says, “is to close the book.”


	The Instagram post also featured an additional message from Swift about the Eras projects. “It was the End of an Era and we knew it,” she wrote. “We wanted to remember every moment leading up to the culmination of the most important and intense chapter of our lives, so we allowed filmmakers to capture this tour and all the stories woven throughout it as it wound down. And to film the final show in its entirety.”


	The End of an Era docuseries promises an intimate look at Swift's life as the tour made headlines and became a global cultural phenomenon from March 2023 through Dec. 2024, playing 149 gigs to more than 10 million fans and grossing over $2 billion. The series will feature a number of her friends and opening acts from the tour, including Gracie Abrams, Sabrina Carpenter, Ed Sheeran and Florence Welch, as well as never-before-seen insight into the creation of the tour. Two episodes of the series will debut each week beginning on Dec. 12.


	In a sneak peek aired on GMA, Swift is seen attempting to relax after a show, filling up a giant marble bathtub while still wearing one of her glittery stage outfits. “I'll not be able to get to sleep, cuz I can't, like, come down until I've watched tons of TV, I get room service in bed, I sign a box of 2,000 CDs and then I'm tired… and then I do the whole thing again,” she says casually as she removes her false eyelashes and makeup.

	











Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The Final Show was filmed at the final stop in Vancouver, B.C. and will also debut on Dec. 12 on Disney+. The full concert film features the entire Tortured Poets Department set, which was added to the tour following that album's release in April 2024. 


Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The End of an Era was directed by Don Argott, co-directed by Sheena M. Joyce and produced by Object & Animal. Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The Final Show was directed by Glenn Weiss and produced by Taylor Swift Productions in association with Silent House Productions.

We'll find out when the Oscar nominations are announced on Jan. 22.

	With Wicked: For Good slated to open in the U.S. on Nov. 21, Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande will be in the Oscar conversation for the second year in a row. Both stars were nominated earlier this year for the first Wicked – Erivo for best actress for playing Elphaba and Grande for best supporting actress for playing Galinda/Glinda.


	If they are nominated again when the nominations for the 98th annual Academy Awards are announced on Jan. 22, 2026, they will become just the seventh and eighth actors to be nominated for playing the same role in two different films.


	Moreover, they'll become the first actors to be nominated for playing the same role two years running since Bing Crosby in the mid-1940s, who received back-to-back nominations for playing genial Father Charles “Chuck” O'Malley. And they'll become only the second and third female actors to be nominated twice for the same role, following Cate Blanchett, who was nominated twice for playing Queen Elizabeth I.


	Of course, just one of the Wicked: For Good stars could be nominated, or neither. If Grande, 32, is nominated, she'll become the youngest actor to receive two nods for playing the same role in two different films in Oscar history. That record is currently held by Al Pacino, who was 34 when he was nominated for the second time for playing Michael Corleone. If Erivo, 38, is nominated, she won't set any age records, but she'll become just the second actor from England to achieve the feat, following Peter O'Toole.


	The first Wicked did well in the Oscar nominations, receiving 10 nods, including best picture. It won two awards – best costume design and best production design.


	Here's a complete list of all the actors who have received Oscar nominations for playing the same character in two different films. The years shown are the year of the film's release.


Character: Father Charles “Chuck” O'Malley


Films: Going My Way (1944) and The Bells of St. Mary's (1945)


Notes: Crosby was nominated for best actor for both films. He was nominated in that category a third and final time for 1954's The Country Girl. Going My Way won a total of seven Oscars, including best picture and best original song, for the smash hit “Swinging on a Star.” The Bells of St. Mary's was nominated for best picture. Crosby, the most popular music star of the first half of the 20th Century, died in 1977 at age 74.


Character: King Henry II


Films: Becket (1964) and The Lion in Winter (1968)


Notes: O'Toole was nominated for both actor for both films. Both films were nominated for best picture. The Englishman received eight acting nods, all in the lead actor category. In addition, he received an honorary award in 2002. He died in 2013 at age 81.


Character: Michael Corleone


Films: The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather Part II (1974)


Notes: Pacino was nominated for best supporting actor for The Godfather (his first nod) and best lead actor for The Godfather Part II. Both films won best picture. Pacino has received nine nominations, spanning 1972-2019. Four of those nominations are for best supporting actor, which puts him in an eight-way tie for most nods in that category with the likes of Jeff Bridges, Jack Nicholson and Mark Ruffalo. Pacino returned to the role of Michael Corleone in the trilogy's final installment, The Godfather Part III, in 1990, but he wasn't nominated.


Character: “Fast Eddie” Felson


Films: The Hustler (1961) and The Color of Money (1986)


Notes: Newman was nominated for best actor for playing pool hustler “Fast Eddie” Felson in both films, winning for The Color of Money. The Hustler was nominated for best picture. Newman received nine acting nominations, spanning 1958-2002. He was also nominated as the producer of best picture nominee Rachel, Rachel, for which his wife, Joanne Woodward, was nominated as best actress. Newman also received two honorary Oscars – an honorary award (now called a Governors Award) and the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award. Newman died in 2008 at age 83.


Character: Queen Elizabeth I


Films: Elizabeth (1998) and Elizabeth: The Golden Age (2007)


	Blanchett is the only female actor with multiple same-character nominations. The Australian was nominated for best actress for both films. Elizabeth, a best picture nominee,brought Blanchett the first of eight nominations for acting.


Character: Rocky Balboa


Films: Rocky (1976) and Creed (2015)


Notes: These are Stallone's only nominations for acting. He was nominated for best actor for Rocky and best supporting actor for Creed. He was also nominated for best original screenplay for Rocky. Stallone has the longest gap between Oscar nominations for playing the same character in two different films – 39 years. Rocky won three Oscars, including best picture. The film's theme song, Bill Conti's “Gonna Fly Now,” was a No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 and an Oscar nominee for best original song.

Their new collab easily topped the poll results with 95% of the vote.

	Ashley Iasimone



	“Eyes Closed,” the new single from JISOO and Zayn Malik, tops this week's fan-voted music poll.


	Music fans voted in a poll published Friday (Oct. 10) on Billboard, choosing the pair's duet as their favorite new release.


	“Eyes Closed” made its grand entrance during a week that also saw new releases from Khalid; Gorillaz feat. Trueno and Proof; Alemeda and Doechii; HAIM and Bon Iver and more. 


	Bringing together a pair of mega pop stars — a former member of One Direction plus one-fourth of BLACKPINK — “Eyes Closed” blends two recognizable voices in one emotional ballad. Fans of both both flooded in to vote in this week's poll, and their support led the singers to a landslide victory.

	“Time is standing still and I don't wanna leave your lips/ Tracing my body with your fingertips,” JISOO begins on the track, to which Malik sings back, “I know what you're feeling and I know you wanna say it/ I do too but we gotta be patient.”

	“‘Cause someone like me/ And someone like you/ Really shouldn't work, yeah, the history is proof/ Damned if I don't/ Damned if I do,” they sing through a chorus about opening their hearts to new love. “Oh, we should fall in love with our eyes closed/ Better if we keep it where we don't know/ The beds we've been in/ The names and the faces of who we were with.”


	Among the new releases trailing behind “Eyes Closed” on the poll: Khalid's After the Sun Goes Down, Gorillaz featuring Trueno and Proof's “The Manifesto,” Alemeda and Doechii's “Beat a B!tch Up,” HAIM and Bon Iver's “Tie You Down” and A Boogie Wit da Hoodie's “Part of Me.”

Gracie Abrams and Ed Sheeran also make cameos in the preview.

	Hannah Dailey



Taylor Swift may have been the lead showgirl on her global Eras Tour, but it took a lot of supporting acts — from Travis Kelce to Sabrina Carpenter — to make the trek as memorable as it was.


	That much is evident in the new trailer for the 14-time Grammy winner's six-part Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The End of an Era docuseries, which dropped Monday (Oct. 13) alongside Swift's announcement for the project on Good Morning America. In the nearly two-minute preview, fans get a glimpse at how present her now-fiancé was behind the scenes, at one point crouching underneath the stage and grinning wide as the pop star bends down and kisses him on the cheek. 

	











	In other parts of the trailer, we see how Swift and Kelce rehearsed his cameo at one of the Eras shows in London last year. In a dressing room, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end concentrates while practicing carrying his then-girlfriend during the Tortured Poets Department section of the three-hour show, with the scene cutting to the couple re-enacting it in full costume on stage.




	The teaser also gives Swifties a look at how several other celebrity drop-ins came together on the Eras Tour, which kicked off in March 2023 and wrapped last December. At one point, Gracie Abrams giggles with Swift behind the scenes, while Carpenter appears in a t-shirt and sits on a couch as the trek's headliner practices guitar. Both Abrams and Carpenter served as openers on different legs of the tour and joined Swift for surprise duets later in the tour.


	Ed Sheeran and Florence Welch also made cameos at different points on the tour, and both appear alongside Swift in revealing rehearsal footage in the trailer. There are also shots of the countless members of Swift's band, dance troupe and stage crew hard at work setting up the show night after night, along with her parents, Scott and Andrea Swift, who are frequently seen smiling and laughing with their daughter.


	“People like to talk about phenomenons,” Swift says in a voiceover. “Almost as if it were pieces falling into place — as if it just happened. The Eras Tour wasn't when all the pieces fell into place. This tour was just when every single one of us who had done so much work, pushing inch-by-inch, to where we all clicked together.”


	As announced Monday morning on GMA, the first two episodes of the Eras Tour docuseries will premiere Dec. 12 on Disney+. Two more episodes will arrive each week after that.


	The project comes two years after Swift's Eras Tour concert film, which pieced together footage from the singer's shows at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles and shattered box-office records. The upcoming docuseries will be paired with an accompanying concert film capturing Swift's final Eras Tour show, which took place in Vancouver.

	











	News of the docuseries arrives just over a week after the release of The Life of a Showgirl, Swift's 12th studio album. The LP quickly obliterated records to achieve the biggest release week for an LP ever and is on track to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.


	Watch the full trailer for Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The End of an Era above.

The singer was seen hanging with her future in-laws, Donna and Ed Kelce, during Sunday's (Oct. 12) game at Arrowhead Stadium.

Taylor Swift has been a little busy lately promoting her The Life of a Showgirl album. But on Sunday (Oct. 12), the singer took some time out from her album duties to support fiancé Travis Kelce at his job. Though Swift has been a fixture at Kansas City Chiefs games over the past few years, Sunday marked the first time the singer was shown on a Chiefs broadcast this season since the couple got engaged in August.

	Ensconced in a VIP suite alongside Kelce's parents — and her future in-laws — Ed and Donna Kelce at Arrowhead Stadium, Swift watched the Chiefs get level at 3-3 for the season as they defeated the Detroit Lions and Travis had a solid day with six receptions and 78 yards, his highest total to date this season. 

	











	The singer also spent some more quality time with WNBA star Caitlin Clark, after missing the Chief's game last Monday night due to her Tonight Show taping in New York. During the first half of the game, the NBC Sunday Night Football crew tossed to the suite to show Swift excitedly hugging her future father-in-law, who was wearing a Kelce jersey, while Swift's game day outfit featured a mini Chiefs jersey dress with red striping detail in a nod to KC's colors.




	According to reports, Swift attended two other games this season — a loss to the Eagles during week two and a win against the Ravens on Sept. 28 — though she entered both of those quietly and was not shown on either broadcast. She was also not on hand on Sept. 5 when the Chiefs kicked off their season with a loss to the L.A. Chargers in São Paulo, Brazil.


	In addition to the Chiefs hard-won victory, Swift had plenty to celebrate this weekend, as Showgirl broke a modern-era record for the most albums sold in a week in the United States. The LP's first week sales consumption figure (equivalent album units, which includes pure sales, streams and track sales) and pure album sales figure running up to a historic 3.4 million in pure album sales (physical and digital purchases), making it the largest sales week for any album since Luminate began electronically tracking music data in 1991, when the modern era of weekly music tabulation began; the final sales figures from Luminate were due to be announced on Sunday (Oct. 12).

The Grammy-nominated MC speaks with Billboard about his Def Jam debut and maintaining longevity in the rap game. 


													By
												

	Kyle Denis



	In 2025, a lot is going on in the world at any given moment — and Wale has prepped an apt soundtrack for that phenomenon. On Nov. 14, the Grammy-nominated D.C. rapper will release his eighth studio album, Everything Is a Lot, via Def Jam.


	The Billboard chart-topping MC's new album promises to tackle the myriad stresses, life developments and global pressures he's encountered in the four years since his last studio LP, 2021's Folarin II. That album, a sequel to his career-shifting 2012 mixtape of the same name, housed the J. Cole-assisted “Poke It Out,” Wale's most recent Billboard Hot 100 entry (No. 73).

	











	“One of the underlying things is how heavy everything is in the world around me, my personal life, and the industry,” he exclusively told Billboard. “I carried all of that with me and got it out of my system through this project.” 


	With an expansive soundscape courtesy of producers such as BNYX, Salaam Remi, Kel-P Vibes, Go Grizz, Streetrunner, Emil and Genio, EIA will include bluesy lead single “Blanco,” which Wale debuted live at Dreamville earlier this year, and “Where to Start,” which samples SWV's classic 1992 hit “I'm So Into You.” The 16-track set, recorded primarily in London and Los Angeles, will also feature genre-bending collaborations with a yet-to-be-revealed roster that includes buzzy names across R&B, hip-hop and Afrobeats.




Everything Is a Lot also serves as Wale's first full-length release under Def Jam, following six albums and over a decade with Rick Ross' Maybach Music Group, an imprint of Warner Records. During that stint, Wale followed up his 2009 Attention Deficit debut studio album with four Billboard 200 top 10 projects, including the No. 1 albums The Gifted (2013) and The Album About Nothing (2015). After a semi-public falling out with MMG, particularly with Meek Mill, Wale signed with Def Jam in 2023, marking a new chapter in his two-decade career. “The industry is a completely different place than it was four years ago,” he reflects. “They had a purge, and a lot of people lost their jobs.”


	Across Everything Is a Lot, Wale's primary goal was “to express a certain level of vulnerability.” To do so, he leaned on soulful samples and bluesy Western influences, the latter of which shine through on “Blanco,” the first song he completed for the forthcoming LP. “It's never as contrived as people think,” he says of the album's varied production and strikingly honest tracks like “Lonely.” “If I'm in the mood to write something, I just get to it. It's all about capturing that feeling in the moment.” On “Fly Away,” Wale samples Maxwell's classic, Grammy-winning “Pretty Wings” for a moving number about “abandonment and attachment issues,” underscoring his commitment to confronting discomfort on the record.


	“It's always been hard to keep people's attention,” Wale says. “That's why my first album is called Attention Deficit. It's become increasingly harder in this day and age, where fans are rewiring themselves to only like what the algorithm tells them to like. It's an uphill battle, so it's a blessing to be in the conversation still.”

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


Apple Original Films‘ F1, the year's highest-grossing MPA movie, is getting a global Apple TV+ streaming date of Friday, December 12.


	Not only is the movie the highest grossing original 2025 to date, but at $629 million it's the highest-grossing title for Apple Original Films and for the sports film genre.


	The Formula 1 racing movie starring Brad Pitt and directed by Joseph Kosinski arrives in homes after a 168-day theatrical window. Warner Bros distributed the movie on behalf of Apple. F1 also marks Pitt's highest-grossing feature to date and notched an A CinemaScore and 97% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes.“It's been thrilling to see audiences around the world embrace F1: The Movie in theaters,” said producer Jerry Bruckheimer. “Now, we're beyond excited to bring this exhilarating, cinematic ride to fans everywhere through Apple TV's unparalleled global reach. Partnering with Apple and Formula 1 has been an incredible journey, and we're proud that even more viewers, from every corner of the world, will get to experience the heart-pounding action and passion that defines F1.”

	











	Pitt plays Sonny Hayes, Formula 1's most promising phenom of the 1990s until an accident on the track nearly ended his career. Thirty years later, he's a nomadic racer-for-hire when he's approached by his former teammate Ruben Cervantes (Javier Bardem), owner of a struggling team on the verge of collapse. Ruben convinces Sonny to come back for one last shot at saving the team and being the best in the world. He'll drive alongside Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris), the team's hotshot rookie intent on setting his own pace. But as the engines roar, Sonny's past catches up with him and he finds that in Formula 1, your teammate is your fiercest competition.

	Pic also stars Kerry Condon, Tobias Menzies and Kim Bodnia and was shot during actual Grand Prix weekends as the team competed against the titans of the sport. In addition to Bruckheimer, Kosinski produces with Formula 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton, Pitt, Dede Gardner, Jeremy Kleiner and Chad Oman.


	Kosinski co-wrote the screenplay with Ehren Kruger. Daniel Lupi is EP. The movie's soundtrack has sold more than 600,000 albums worldwide and is nearing 1 billion global streams. In addition to topping Billboard's Top Movie Songs chart with seven of the top 10 tracks, the album counts Tate McRae's two-time VMA-nominated smash hit “Just Keep Watching.”

Taylor Swift and Sabrina Carpenter are probably going to be corporate media's last “pop stars”, because that institution doesn't have the clout to astroturf talent anymore.

It didn't have to be this way. But the system became more about following existing trends than creating new ones, and now bands are more capable of breaking out online than through the legacy media.

This is an interesting take – Genuinely curious what you mean by this – can you elaborate more? Are you referencing the fact that Taylor Swift is so huge that she's now calling the shots with her content distribution? Or the possibility that corporate media is not going to want to work with stars of this magnitude because they are so expensive and demanding that it's all gotten too big?

I guess Disney+ is going up again. Think I'll keep my subscription cancelled.

“looking forward to this” – my 50 year old aunt, probably

Ummm no one asked. Also if you're so annoyed, why are you reading it and commenting at 6am?

TV Reporter


	Dearest gentle reader, a new season of Bridgerton is forthcoming.


Netflix revealed Monday that Season 4 will premiere with four episodes on January 29, 2026. An additional four episodes will follow on February 26. In addition to the premiere dates, a teaser trailer also gives audiences a tantalizing glimpse at Luke Thompson‘s Benedict encountering his love interest Sophie Baek (Yerin Ha).


	“With each passing season, one is known to experience plenty of ups and downs,” Lady Whistledown muses in the teaser. “So then we must ask ourselves, do we rise to the occasion? As always, time and this author will tell.”

			Watch on Deadline		







	The fourth season of Shonda Rhimes‘ Bridgerton turns its focus to bohemian second son Benedict. Despite his elder and younger brothers both being happily married, Benedict is loath to settle down — until he meets a captivating Lady in Silver at his mother's masquerade ball.


	That “Lady in Silver” is Sophie. In the novel, she is the daughter of an earl and one of his maids. Though she was brought up in his house out of a sense of responsibility, he never claimed her as his kin and allowed her to suffer quite a troubling upbringing at the hands of her stepmother and stepsisters.


	Though Benedict's search for a love match is the subject of the third novel, the TV series made a change in the order with Season 3 taking on the fourth book instead, Romancing Mister Bridgerton, which spotlights the romance between Colin Bridgerton, played by Luke Newton, and Penelope Featherington, played by Nicola Coughlan.

	











	Newton and Coughlan are expected to return as series regulars for Season 4 along with Jonathan Bailey (Anthony Bridgerton), Victor Alli (Lord John Stirling), Adjoa Andoh (Lady Danbury), Julie Andrews (Lady Whistledown), Lorraine Ashbourne (Mrs. Varley), Masali Baduza (Michaela Stirling), Hannah Dodd (Francesca Stirling), Daniel Francis (Lord Marcus Anderson), Ruth Gemmell (Violet Bridgerton), Florence Hunt (Hyacinth Bridgerton), Martins Imhangbe (Will Mondrich), Claudia Jessie (Eloise Bridgerton), Luke Newton (Colin Bridgerton), Golda Rosheuvel (Queen Charlotte), Will Tilston (Gregory Bridgerton), Polly Walker (Portia Featherington), Emma Naomi (Alice Mondrich), Hugh Sachs (Brimsley).


	Additional key characters returning are Kate Sharma (Simone Ashley), Isabella Wei (Posy Li), Michelle Mao (Rosamund Li), and Katie Leung (Lady Araminta Gun).

					By Stewart Clarke 




EXCLUSIVE: Avalon founder Jon Thoday has given his characteristically forthright take on the Paddington lawsuit amid the ongoing bust-up over a bear.


As Deadline revealed last week, Studiocanal, producer of the Paddington movies, and Michael Bond's estate have sued Avalon for copyright infringement after satirical puppet show Spitting Image depicted the famous Peruvian bear as a loco drug-taking podcaster.


	Deadline ran into Thoday, Avalon's joint founder and Co-Executive Chairman, at MIPCOM in Cannes. Of course, we had to ask about the Paddington spat.

	“When Roger asked us to bring Spitting Image back a few years ago, we were incredibly honored to do that and support everything that Spitting Image means,” Thoday said. “We never expected to get sued by Studiocanal, a giant organization that one would have thought also supports creative work.”

	











	He added: “This company has made two brilliantly funny films, particularly Paddington 2 I think, I'm a fan of that. It didn't really cross my mind that a company that also did comedy would pursue us for, essentially, a joke.”


	Studiocanal declined to comment.


	Thoday noted that, historically, people parodied in the show, even in some of the more grotesque puppet forms, have taken pride in the fact. Several have even sought to buy their rubber doppelgangers. Spitting Image notably took aim at Yoda in a previous season, avoiding legal papers from Disney in the process. It is a given that its sketches have always been on the nose. It has, however, rarely found itself in the crosshairs of the lawyers. Now, Avalon is itself lawyering up.

	











	“There was a discussion about whether we should listen to them [Studiocanal], or whether we should continue to parody what we think is a funny thing,” Thoday explained. “I said, of course, we should continue to support the creatives on the show. I've just simply said we should give it to the best lawyers we can find and let the law do its thing.”


	It's fair to say that in the wake of the lawsuit, Spitting Image was not cowed. The second sketch, available on YouTube, showed Paddington snorting piles of white powder while wiping his furry bottom on the legal papers served by a company called “Studio C-Anal.” It is perhaps notable, however, that Paddington's appearance in this follow-up changed: gone was the signature red hat and duffle coat.


	Is there more to come? “It wasn't a news story until Studiocanal made it one. And SpittingImage is about parodying the news, so you couldn't really not do that,” Thoday said about the show returning to the topic. “I'm not the producer of the show, so I can't possibly say… but Spitting Image is all about following news stories, and if it's still a news story, I imagine there will be more.”


	Amid the legal fight, Thoday noted that Studiocanal has itself produced a satirical puppet show, Les Guignols, and professed himself a fan of the films and series the French studio makes and sells.


	“If you look at some of their catalogs, they've got some of the Ealing comedies, they've got Paddington, which are really funny movies, and they have The Producers, which is a movie that I incredibly admire. I can't imagine that Mel Brooks would think that attacking a bear is a good use of money.”


Speaking to Radio Times last week, Al Murray, co-creator of Spitting Image‘s YouTube incarnation, defended the series, citing freedom of speech. Avalon is on the same page. “In the climate we're living in at the moment, freedom of speech is important,” Thoday said. “I think comedians need to be able to make jokes, as they always have done, and that's what Spitting Image does.”


	Avalon is shopping Spitting Image in Cannes, along with the likes of Taskmaster and new Julia Roberts-narrated comedy drama Leonard and Hungry Paul.

Yes, the lawsuit is absurd, but it's tempting to think StudioCanal are just suing because the sketches are just lazy and unfunny. They never sued Mitchell and Webb over Paddington Corpse rising from the dead in their Zombie Poppins routine.

					By Stewart Clarke 




EXCLUSIVE: Channel 4 has ordered what is certain to be a controversial documentary that analyzes a sample of Adolf Hitler's DNA. Blink Films is making Hitler's DNA: Blueprint of a Dictator.


	Blink has a sample of the dictator's DNA, which it said has been verified through scientific testing. The UK-based producer said its doc will examine whether Hitler's genes played any part influencing his psychology or behavior. Production is underway. A premiere date has not been set, but we hear it is likely to bow this year.


	In the factual two-parter, world-leading geneticist Dr. Turi King and renowned historian Dr Alex Kay work with an international assortment of health professionals, behavior experts and other scientists to decode and analyze Hitler's genetic makeup.

	The project was commissioned for Channel 4 by Jonah Weston and Emily Shields. “Nothing can ever fully explain Adolf Hitler's evil,” said Weston. “But finding Hitler's DNA is an incredible feat of scientific detective work – and gives unprecedented insights into history's most studied man.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Dan Chambers, Creative Director, Blink Films added: “For 80 years, there has been lots of speculation about Hitler's medical and psychiatric conditions. Now, by looking into his DNA for the first time in history, we're able to reveal a whole series of things – some that we might have expected, others that are really surprising.”


ITV Studios is distributing and the series is on its MIPCOM slate. We hear it is already generating buyer interest with deals expected soon. Internationally, it is being sold as a two-parter and a single 90-minute doc.

	











	The doc is directed by James Routh, produced by Zoé Wiggins, and the executive producers are Dan Chambers and Nina Davies.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","The Chair Company's premiere is all in Tim Robinson's head","https://www.avclub.com/the-chair-company-premiere-recap","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 03:36:00 GMT","

There are lines from I Think You Should Leave that are always rattling around in my brain: “We're all trying to find the guy who did this,” “I don't even want to be around anymore,” “Triples is best,” etc. But the one I come back to most often encapsulates the impotent rage and inability to let anything go that unites Tim Robinson and Zach Kanin's breakout Netflix hit, its Comedy Central predecessor Detroiters, and their new HBO series The Chair Company: “What have they done to us?” Whether it's the property-line-defending spokesman for the Darmine Doggy Door, the Driving Crooner, or Chair Company schmoe Ron Trosper, Robinson and Kanin's protagonists typically have some amorphous, nefarious “they” aligned against them. But to this point, only Trosper's story has had the space to really put a face to the they—or explore if there's even a they there. 

Similar to the Robinson-starring Friendship (which hails from one of The Chair Company's primary directors, Andrew DeYoung), the series premiere “Life Goes By Too F**king Fast, It Really Does” is an experiment in how long I Think You Should Leave-style premises and schtick can be sustained. In terms of keeping my shoulders tense and my hand firmly cupped around my mouth, the episode does the trick. This is quintessential Robinson/Kanin stuff: the small sting of public humiliation festering to the point that it consumes a character's entire being. In Ron's case, the swing dancer who flips his wife over at a wedding is the chair that collapses beneath him following a big corporate presentation. His moment of triumph—being named the project manager for a new mall in Canton, Ohio—thus sullied, our man from Fisher Robay tumbles down a rabbit hole that exposes character flaws that make for the cringiest of cringe comedy. Yet there's just enough hard evidence to suggest that this isn't all in his head.

“Life Goes By Too F**king Fast, It Really Does,” however, is. It's deeply embedded in Ron's POV: As his search for answers ramps up, the episode trades a more workmanlike depiction of home and office life for the look and feel of a conspiracy thriller whose stakes are much higher than “Who tampered with the furniture to make this one guy look like an ass in front of his peers?” DeYoung and cinematographer Ashley Connor shoot Ron's introduction to the Canton Marketplace at Bear Run, an otherwise bog-standard corporate address, in a bobbing, long-lens surveillance style. There's some comedy to be found in that disconnect, as in the tension between the more paranoid electronic burbles of Keegan Dewitt's score and easygoing '70s needle drops from Jim Croce and George Benson. But this is mostly mood setting, settling us into Ron's short-fused state of mind even as the script takes his descent into madness from 0 to 60—a pacing that makes a lot of sense, considering the creators' sketch-comedy background.

That background provides us a shortcut to understanding Ron, too. He is the Tim Robinson archetype: a middle-aged, middle-of-the-road dude without many healthy emotional outlets or, from what we can glean from the first 32 minutes of The Chair Company, genuine connections with other people. These qualities didn't prevent him from marrying the conventionally attractive Barb (Lake Bell) or from raising a basketball phenom son (Will Price's Seth) and a daughter who's about to get married (Sophia Lillis' Natalie), but they do clearly keep him from being satisfied with how relatively good he has it. 

That's driven home by an early exchange with the co-worker who was passed over for Ron's promotion, Douglas (Jim Downey). The few pearls about contentment from the bubble-necklace-wearing old-timer played by 2025's hottest septuagenarian comedy writer go in one of Ron's ears and out the other. Yet they burrow deep enough beneath his skin that he later rips Douglas' prized toy bauble from his neck after he disrupts one of Ron's cockamamie attempts at exposing mysterious chair manufacturer Tecca. Ron might be asserting his status with this little faux pas, but the fact that it becomes another source of anxiety proves such power plays don't come naturally to him. Robinson makes his character seem much more accustomed to peeking through horizontal blinds, cowering under his desk, or sneaking out of his office on his knees.

That we've learned so little about anyone else in his orbit is where The Chair Company starts to look less like an extended sketch and more like a weekly TV series. Little details about Seth's college prospects or Natalie's upcoming nuptials are teased out but left for future installments to expand upon. We don't know everything about Ron yet, either; a late-episode sitdown with his boss, Brenda (Zuleyma Guevara), reveals that he previously left Fisher Robay for a year to start a pipe dream of an outdoor excursion company that led to one, sad rope bridge paid for by a mortgage on the Trosper family home. (It's apparently become his preferred sulking spot, as we see after the chair incident.) And then there's the matter of the guy who later attacks Ron in the parking lot, apparent retribution for his trespassing on Tecca property—a fruitless adventure that leads to nothing but the discovery of some photocopied porn, a big red ball, and a filthy toilet stall that Ron made filthier thanks to his insistence that one half of a deviled egg appetizer would make for good leftovers down the road. 

Those smutty smartphone snapshots are bound to come back and haunt Ron, as is the indignity-within-the-indignity of unintentionally seeing up a colleague's skirt after the chair gave way.  These are reasons to want to see what else Robinson and Kanin have in store for us in the coming weeks, as are the little bits of comic embroidery they do around the rising action and character building. I Think You Should Leave-esque flourishes abound, like the telling cutaway to Ron complaining he has “the worst pillow in town,” one co-worker telling another “you gave me that paper too hard,” or the office custodian fretting over being caught outdoors with his “inside wheelbarrow.”

There's no mistaking who created this show, and I have to imagine that your mileage with it will vary with your tolerance for Robinson's onscreen persona and his and Kanin's knack for digging that persona into deep, deep, deep holes. Performance-wise, there's not a ton he's showing us in the premiere that he hasn't shown us elsewhere; it's the packaging and the storytelling real estate that's different. That, plus there's the opportunity to play around with mysteries that go a little bit further (but still contain trace ingredients of) those questions that plague the guy who thought he was going to be eaten by a pig in a Richard Nixon mask. What have they done to us? What are they doing to Ron? I don't know, but this premiere makes me eager to find out.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Keira Knightley says she was unaware of J.K. Rowling boycott before joining Harry Potter audiobook","https://www.avclub.com/keira-knightley-jk-rowling-harry-potter-audiobook-boycott","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 00:40:00 GMT","

Ah, to be Keira Knightley and live blissfully unaware of the noxious cauldron of transphobic hate that author J.K. Rowling has been stirring for the last decade. It's been six years of Rowling making transphobia her entire brand by endangering and denigrating transgender people online and successfully advocating for legal restrictions against the marginalized group of people. As such, those who took her book's message of acceptance and tolerance to heart have chosen not to spend their hard-earned money on Rowling's many projects, including those related to Harry Potter. Yet, Knightley didn't know about that when she signed on to voice Professor Umbridge in Audible's Harry Potter: The Full-Cast Audio Editions audiobooks. It also sounds like it wouldn't have made a difference. Speaking to Decider, Knightley pleaded ignorance of Rowling's “ongoing campaign against trans people,” as the publication put it.

“I was not aware of that, no,” she said. “I'm very sorry. You know, I think we're all living in a period of time right now where we're all going to have to figure out how to live together, aren't we? And we've all got very different opinions. I hope that we can all find respect.”

Her Woman In Cabin 10 director, Simon Stone, piggybacked off that sentiment by equivocating the victims of Rowling's hate for the perpetrator. “I think that we have learned over time, unfortunately, that the unbearable voice in the room is something that we should try and shut down,” Stone said. “And actually, I think everyone needs to recognize that they're the unbearable voice for someone else, as well. The live and let live thing of like, ‘Oh God, your voice is really loud, and I can't stand you.' That's part of our lives.” (The billionaire's voice is much louder than that of the small and vulnerable population of trans people, but go off.)

“We all have hatred, deep hatred for someone in the universe—someone in the class. Let's reduce it to classroom politics. There is always the kid that we cannot stand. I think we'd all agree that where that kid for someone else, too,” he continued. “Unfortunately, all sides of the political spectrum are currently trying to shut that kid's voice down, but they don't realize the irony of the fact that they're also that kid for someone else. If we can all have a moratorium on that, and just let chaos live for a little bit, we might find our way out.”

In the interest of letting “chaos live for a little bit,” earlier this year, Rowling's influence and wealth helped push forward a U.K. Supreme Court judgment that ruled trans women should not be considered women, which, according to NBC, “wip[ed] out decades of civil rights advances for British transgender people.” Rowling responded by posting a picture of herself smoking a cigar and holding a cocktail with the caption, “I love it when a plan comes together.”

HBO Max is heading back to the Land of Ooo for the second season of the Adventure Time spin-off, Fionna And Cake. Missing from Adult Swim's line-ups since 2023, the show has survived the streamer's recent name change to make its long-overdue return. Fionna And Cake takes place somewhere in the Adventure Time multiverse, where Finn the Human and Jake the Dog are replaced by the gender-swapped Fionna and species-swapped Cake the Cat. The new season picks up where the last left off. Set in a world where magic only exists in her dreams, Fionna is stuck working dead-end jobs by day and saving the magical universe by night.



Here's the synopsis:

After their journey through the multiverse, Fionna and Cake tackle new adventures while Huntress Wizard embarks on a desperate quest with fatal consequences.

The new 10-episode season debuts on October 23 on HBO Max, with new episodes running through Christmas Day.

Diane Keaton was last seen out in 2024, nearly a year before her family confirmed her passing in California. The Oscar winner was spotted doing some holiday shopping in Los Angeles, one of her final public outings before stepping away from the spotlight.

That day, Keaton looked radiant and relaxed, dressed in her signature style: a black turtleneck, boxy gray trousers, a dark blazer, and her trademark bowler hat and round glasses. She smiled warmly and waved to fans as she strolled through the shops, exuding the same effortless grace and charm that had defined her for decades.

The rare sighting delighted admirers who had missed seeing the beloved actress in public.

In her later years, Keaton had chosen a quieter, more private life, focusing on her passions, family, and the simple joys that brought her peace.

Before her 2024 Los Angeles sighting, Keaton's previous public appearance was at the 2023 U.S. Open Tennis Championships in New York City. She was photographed enjoying the final match between Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka while sitting alongside actress Ariana DeBose.

As always, her fashion sense stood out. She wore white trousers, a black-and-white striped blouse, a dark blazer, and her trademark hat. Keaton sipped a drink while chatting and cheering, radiating her usual effortless charm.

The sighting became a fan favorite online, with many admiring how timeless her sense of style remained after decades in Hollywood.

Even as she lived a more private life, Diane Keaton's love for fashion never waned. In a 2021 interview with Interview magazine, she explained why black remained her timeless color of choice.

“I think you almost always have to have a little bit of the color black to frame things,” she said. “It really sucks you in. I'm always going to love black because it highlights. It accentuates. It's beautiful. Whatever.”

Her signature style included crisp suits, bowler hats, and oversized glasses, which became as iconic as her performances in “Annie Hall” and “Something's Gotta Give.” 

Effortlessly blending quirk and sophistication, Keaton turned her fashion sense into an extension of her artistry, inspiring generations who admired her authenticity and confidence.

In her later years, Keaton spoke often about what truly brought her peace: nature, friendship, and quiet moments. During her Interview chat, close friend Carol Kane asked what she valued most, and Keaton's answer reflected her grounded spirit.

“I value a very strong friendship, like ours, which I've depended on for such a long time,” she said. “I love to walk with my dog. These are the things I love. And I really do love nature. I love exploring California. I like driving to Arizona. I really enjoy seeing. I guess my favorite thing in life is the fact that I can see. It's just so unbelievable.”

Even as she stepped away from the spotlight, Keaton continued to work behind the scenes. At the time of her passing, she had three projects in development: Artist in Residence with Josh Hutcherson, The Making Of with Blake Lively, and Constance, directed by Mark Pellington.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Legend Diane Keaton's Friend Shares Heartbreaking Detail From Final Visit","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/diane-keaton-friend-weight-loss-before-passing/","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 00:27:58 GMT","

Diane Keaton's friend detailed what it was like to see the actress before her tragic passing at the age of 79.

In an interview with PEOPLE, Grammy and Oscar-winning songwriter Carole Bayer Sager spoke about her final visit with Keaton. 

“I saw her two or three weeks ago, and she was very thin,” Sager says. “She had lost so much weight.”

Sager also detailed how she hadn't seen too much of Keaton this past year because she's been in Palm Springs due to the wildfires in California.

“She had to go to Palm Springs because her house had been damaged inside, and they had to clean everything,” Sager explained. “She was down there for a while, and when she came back, I was kind of stunned by how much weight she'd lost.”

But was clear was how much Keaton meant to everyone. 

“She was a magic light for everyone,” Sager added. “I just loved her. She was so special, she just lit up a room with her energy. She was happy and upbeat and taking photographs of everything she saw. She was completely creative; she never stopped creating.”

In November 2024, Diane Keaton released the song “First Christmas,” which she worked on with Sager and Jonas Myrin.

“She so loved recording this song,” Sager told PEOPLE. “She was almost childlike about it.”

“She was so authentic when she sang it, I mean, she just sang it like she was singing it, and she was sort of acting it, you know, because she is a great actress,” she added. “And then she'd start to cry when she was singing it. But she did such a beautiful job.”

Sager also spoke about Keaton's incredible style, detailing how she took every opportunity to put together an outfit.

 “She went to the movies always dressed like she was about to shoot another scene for Annie Hall,” Sager told PEOPLE. “She'd wear her hats and her jackets and her baggy pants, and her belts. 

“She was a fashion icon of her own making.”

Another friend of Keaton's spoke with PEOPLE after her death, explaining how the actress spent her final days. 

They detailed how she was “funny right up until the end,” going on to add that she was “one in a million.” 

“She lived exactly how she wanted to, which was on her own terms, surrounded by the people and things she really loved,” they added.

We have lost a great actress, clear and still funny, family movies friendly.

Diane was a great actress. Loved her in “Looking For Mr. Goodbar”. It was sad to hear of her passing and she's truly a hard act to follow. R.I.P. Diane.

Diane was so amazing she always had the biggest and brightest smile, she will be missed… She was a gift to the world…

Diane Keaton and Al Pacino met while filming the 1972 classic “The Godfather.” He played Michael Corleone. She was Kay Adams-Corleone, his on-screen wife. What started as cinematic chemistry soon turned into a real romance that captivated Hollywood. They began dating in 1971 and spent more than a decade in an on-and-off relationship defined by passion, respect, and creative connection. 

But Keaton wanted something lasting. When Pacino never proposed, she made the painful choice to walk away in 1987.

In interviews over the years, Keaton often described Pacino as the great love of her life, while friends now say the feeling was mutual.

Following Keaton's passing on October 11 at age 79, a close friend of Pacino's revealed to the Daily Mail that the actor had been deeply affected by her death.

“Looking back, Al admits the love of his life was Diane, who he's always called ‘an amazing woman,'” the source said. “I know he will forever regret he didn't make his move when he had the chance.”

The insider added, “For years after he and Diane split, Al used to say, ‘If it's meant to be, it's never too late for a do-over.' But sadly, now it is.”

Though they both lived in Beverly Hills for years, Pacino and Keaton reportedly hadn't spoken in a long time before her death.

“Though he and Diane both lived only a few miles from each other for years, they never spoke,” the source explained. “I once asked him why, and he told me, ‘There's no need to talk with each other. We said everything that needed to be said at the time.”

Despite the silence between them, those close to Pacino say his affection for Keaton never truly faded.

Now 85, Pacino remains one of Hollywood's most celebrated stars. Though he has dated many women and raised three children, marriage was something he never pursued.

Keaton also followed her own path, embracing independence while raising her two adopted children, Dexter and Duke, with love and quiet strength.

Their story, filled with romance, respect, and reflection, became one of Hollywood's most timeless connections. It was a love that shaped them both, even long after it ended. “She was his equal in every way,” a close friend shared. “And he knew it.”

A life lesson…DON'T deny true love.  Embrace it, feed it, let it grow deeper than the roots of the largest tree.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Robert De Niro Shares Touching Tribute to Diane Keaton, His ‘Godfather Part II' Costar","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/robert-de-niro-diane-keaton-godfather-tribute/","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 16:12:00 GMT","

Hollywood stars are mourning the loss of Diane Keaton, who passed away on October 11, 2025. Keaton's “The Godfather Part II” costar Robert De Niro released a statement following the actress' death.

A post shared by Francis Ford Coppola (@francisfordcoppola)

Following the news of Keaton's passing at age 79, De Niro shared a statement with The Hollywood Reporter.

“I am very sad to hear of Diane's passing. I was very fond of her and the news of her leaving us has taken me totally by surprise,” De Niro's statement read.

“I was not expecting her to leave us. She will be missed,” the actor added. “May she rest in peace.”

Keaton starred in “The Godfather” trilogy, costarring with De Niro in “The Godfather Part II” (1974). The two were also costars in “Marvin's Room” (1996) and “The Big Wedding” (2013).

“The Godfather” trilogy director, Francis Ford Coppola, posted a touching tribute to Keaton in an October 12 Instagram post.

“Words can't express the wonder and talent of Diane Keaton. Endlessly intelligent, so beautiful. From her earliest performances in ‘Hair' and throughout her amazing career, she was an extraordinary actor,” Coppola wrote.

The director continued, “I saw her in the film ‘Lovers and Other Strangers' and knew I had to have her play Kay in ‘The Godfather,' (which she told me she based on my wife Ellie) and her wonderful work in ‘Annie Hall' while simultaneously setting a new fashion trend.”

Coppola added, “Everything about Diane was creativity personified.”

A post shared by Goldie Hawn (@goldiehawn)

There have been a flood of tributes for Keaton from her many co-stars, including “The First Wives Club” stars Bette Midler and Goldie Hawn.

Midler wrote in her tribute, posted on Instagram: “The brilliant, beautiful, extraordinary Diane Keaton has died. I cannot tell you how unbearably sad this makes me. She was hilarious, a complete original, and completely without guile, or any of the competitiveness one would have expected from such a star.”

The actress added, “What you saw was who she was … oh, la, lala!”

Hawn also shared a heartfelt tribute to Keaton on Instagram. “Diane, we aren't ready to lose you. You've left us with a trail of fairy dust, filled with particles of light and memories beyond imagination,” she wrote.

The actress continued, “How do we say goodbye? What words can come to mind when your heart is broken? You never liked praise, so humble, but now you can't tell me to ‘shut up' honey. There was, and will be, no one like you.”

Hawn noted, “You stole the hearts of the world and shared your genius with millions, making films that made us laugh and cry in ways only you could. I was blessed to make ‘First Wives Club' with you, our days starting with coffee in the makeup trailer, laughing and joking, right through to the very last day of filming. It was a roller coaster of love.”

The actress also revealed their hope to live together in the future. “We agreed to grow old together, and one day, maybe live together with all our girlfriends,” she wrote. “Well, we never got to live together, but we did grow older together. Who knows … maybe in the next life.”

Hawn added, “Shine your fairy dust up there, girlfriend. I'm going to miss the hell out of you. My heart goes out to your beautiful children, Dex and Duke. I love you.”

Former “The Real Housewives of Orange County” star Alexis Bellino celebrated her wedding day to John Janssen on Oct. 3. The couple's special day was held in Laguna Beach, California, with a few of Bellino's former “Real Housewives” co-stars in attendance, including Tamra Judge and Jo De La Rosa.

A post shared by Alexis Bellino (@alexis_bellino)

Alexis Bellino made sure to capture every moment of her wedding to John Janssen. From the beautiful rustic ceremony to the fun-filled reception, the former “Real Housewives” star shared these intimate moments with her fans on Instagram. 

Bellino's first photos offered a closer look at her romantic wedding ceremony, featuring a sweet moment of her and Janssen holding hands as they gazed into each other's eyes. Another photo captured the stunning setting, Bellino walking down the aisle lined with beautiful flowers and framed by tall trees.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘Haunted Harmony Mysteries' — Will Hallmark Continue Franchise After ‘Buried at C?'","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/haunted-harmony-mysteries-more-movies-2025/","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 16:22:20 GMT","

As Hallmark Channel premieres “Haunted Harmony Mysteries: Buried at C” on October 12, 2025, sleuthers are likely hoping that the second movie in the franchise isn't the last. 

Good news! It appears two more “Haunted Harmony Mysteries” starring Tamera Mowry-Housley, Marco Grazzini, and Risteard Cooper are on the way — with one movie already filmed and another filming now in Ireland. That means the gap between movies shouldn't be nearly as long as the two years between the first, 2023's “Murder in G Major,” and the latest installment. 

While promoting “Buried at C” with Grazzini, Mowry-Housley let it slip during an interview with “Good Day Sacramento” on October 8 that they were in Ireland filming a fourth movie. 

When she, Grazzini, and Cooper returned to Ireland in early 2025 to film “Buried at C,” there was plenty of time on their shoot schedule to film a third installment — though it's not clear what it will be called or when it will be released. 

According to Ireland's Screen Crew and Services Database, the cast and crew were scheduled to film for more than two months, from February 4 to April 11, in Dublin and in picturesque Wicklow, located about 30 miles south of the city. Given that most Hallmark movies stick to a 15-day production schedule, the cast and crew were able to film two new movies based on Alexia Gordon's Gethsemane Brown Mysteries five-book series. 

In the first “Haunted Harmony Mysteries,” we meett main character Gethsemane, a former orchestra conductor living in Ireland to teach at a boarding school, St. Brendan's, where she's tasked with turning a motley group of students into an award-winning chorus.

However, when she keeps hearing the same four notes playing in the old Irish house where she's staying, she discovers it's the ghost of one of her music idols, a songwriter-musician, Eamon (played by Cooper), who perished years before in a mysterious murder-suicide.

Able to see his spirit, Gethsemane reluctantly starts working with him to try to solve the mystery and clear his name. She gets assistance from local Inspector O'Reilly, played by Adam Fergus, and her teaching colleague Griff (played by Hallmark fan favorite and “Virgin River” actor Grazzini.).

A post shared by tameramowryhousley (@tameramowrytwo)

In the synopsis for “Buried at C,” Hallmark says, “Beloved music teacher Gethsemane Brown returns to solve a new case that hits a little too close to home when her brother, Jackson, is implicated in the murder of local troublemaker Ray.” 

The logline continues, “Gethsemane and spirited partner Eamon join forces with Captain Mac, now a ghost after Ray killed him to cover up the theft of a violin recovered from the Titanic. As the investigation progresses, Gethsemane dives into a tangled web of secrets, stolen artifacts, and family drama to clear her brother's name, all while navigating her own romantic entanglements.” 

“Haunted Harmony Mysteries: Buried at Sea” premieres on October 12 at 8 p.m. Eastern time, and will be available to stream via Hallmark+ the following day. 

Love Haunted Harmony Mysteries.
So happy that it is not a syrupy, smoochy movie. We all know Hallmark has the same basic
foundation. Girl attracted, then overhears conversation with his old sweetheart, but not the rest
of the story. OR girl on a stepladder, slips into his arms, their eyes meet and you know the rest.
Let's face it, that is not “Real Life”. If you've seen one, you know how it will go.
Soooo it is refreshing to see something entirely different. Love the interaction of “who done it “
And absolutely love the part of the ghost, that she can see. It stays to format of a mystery.
Thank you Hallmark  🙏🦋♥️

Tucked inside a mostly benign press release about the upcoming streaming availability of Joseph Kosinski's recent feature “F1,” some other news: don't call it Apple TV+ anymore. It's now, per a Monday morning press release, “simply Apple TV, with a vibrant new identity.”

What that vibrant new identity is actually beyond “easier to remember,” it's currently unclear. Head on over to the streamer's official website, and everything is still branded “Apple TV+.” For now, the same is still true of the app (at least, on this reporter's iPhone). We can sense an app update in the offing, and fast.

 










Also a question? What this means for Apple's other Apple TV, the company's physical streaming box, which connects to a television to provide access to streaming apps and services. Call it the Apple Box, and be done with it.

Apple TV+, as it was then known, launched on November 1, 2019 as the tech giant's very first foray into the streaming market. Launch day included the debut of “The Morning Show,” as well as the Jason Momoa-led “See” and Hailee Steinfeld in “Dickinson.” Later that year, the fledgling streamer also got into the film biz, rolling out films like “Hala” and “The Elephant Queen.”

 










Along the way, the streamer has enjoyed some serious smash hits on the TV side (like recent winner “The Studio,” which recently won 22 Emmys, and enduring fave “Severance”). Movies remain top of mind, too, from the massive “F1” to films from some of Hollywood's biggest names, like Spike Lee and Paul Greengrass, just to name some recent titles. In 2022, “CODA” won Best Picture at the 94th Academy Awards, which made Apple the first streaming service to win the award.

Coming up next: movies like “The Family Plan 2,” “Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost,” “Come See Me in the Good Light,” and series like “Plurbius.” Oh, and for “F1” fans: the Brad Pitt-starring actioner will start streaming on Apple TV (no plus!) on Friday, December 12.

Earlier this year, rival streamer HBO Max similarly trotted out a new (in this case, old) name change, reverting back to its original moniker after trying to make a go out of just “Max” for nearly two years. Add the HBO, drop the +, whatever it is, it's all a bit cleaner.

Sadly, we're still a few appearances shy of commencing the Tim Meadowsaissance, heretofore referred to as “The Meadows' Spring Awakening.” (Not every name + “renaissance” rolls off the tongue like “McConaissance.”) Yes, the beloved character actor recently reprised his iconic role as Mr. Duvall in the “Mean Girls” musical and jolted extra life into “Peacemaker” Season 2 as a federal agent with “bird blindness,” but two standout supporting turns in two years (plus recurring voice roles) does not an awakening make. (Blame Paramount for nixing Michel Gondry's musical “Golden,” which featured Meadows next to Pharrell Williams and Brian Tyree Henry — now that could've ushered in an Awakening.)

“DMV” gets the “SNL” vet closer to a winter bloom, but through two episodes, the CBS sitcom about beleaguered driving examiners, paper pushers, and desk jockeys isn't providing its star enough fertilizer. (OK, OK, I'll stop with the plant metaphors.) Really, it's under-serving each of its talented cast members, which — if we follow our crestfallen leads and look at the bright side — at least means it's a solvable problem (unlike the DMV itself).

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






The single-camera comedy starts by admitting what everyone already knows: Nobody likes the DMV. Every driver's worst nightmare — yes, even more than crashing their dream car the second it rolls off the lot — is being forced to visit the Department of Motor Vehicles, a place where time stops and the red tape rolls on forever. 

Colette (Harriet Dyer) knows the grind all too well. She's been working at the East Hollywood DMV for five years, despite promising herself (and anyone listening) it's just a temp job. Her closest friends aren't clinging to the same sliver of sunshine Colette needs to keep going, but Vic (Tony Cavalero) and Gregg (Meadows) still support her whenever they can. Vic savors life's simple pleasures — a meatball sub with crinkled potato chips for lunch, a shirtless afternoon on a hot day — even if they come at the expense of others. (That was Gregg's sub, and Vic's co-workers aren't exactly thrilled about their half-nude colleague.)

Gregg is identified in the press notes as a misanthrope, but the jury's still out on that predetermined character trait. Sure, when he mentions his frigid marital bed, it's more statement than complaint, but he's also positioned as Colette's most supportive, encouraging friend. He cares about what counts — so far, at least.

 










Much can change after the first hour of a network sitcom, and at least a few things need to in “DMV.” For starters, Colette feels familiar for the wrong reasons. Both episodes pivot around her crush on Noa (Alex Tarrant), a hunky New Zealander who's only been working at the DMV for a few weeks. Quickly establishing a “will they, won't they” romance is a safe bet for viewer retention, and their rapport is sound enough. It's just that creator Dana Klein (“9JKL,” “Friends with Better Lives”) seems to be positioning Dyer in a similar dynamic as her breakout role on the Aussie serial rom-com, “Colin from Accounts” — awkwardly flirting, awkwardly plotting, and generally embarrassing herself over and over.

Too much of the banter is sloppy and too many of her mistakes are avoidable. (The climax of the pilot really stretches to put Colette in an embarrassing spot.) “DMV” also recycles too many jokes within the same 20-minute arc. (I'm hesitant to identify them as “callbacks” — a new comedy should be eager to show off new jokes, and the adhesive maxi-pad bit just isn't funny enough for a running gag.) At least we know Dyer is playing in a familiar sandbox, so it's safe to assume she'll start building better castles in time.

Everyone else leaves too little impact. Cavalero worked wonders on “The Righteous Gemstones,” and his eccentric ex-bouncer has plenty of untapped potential in the stuffy confines of a government office building. Tarrant is stuck playing a boring dreamboat, making it hard to tell if he'll expand beyond Dyer's dorky straight man. The office manager, Barbara Berry (Molly Kearney), gets points for stretching her well-intentioned buffoon of a boss, while ID photographer Ceci (Gigi Zumbado) barely gets enough screen time to speak her lines.

 










That leaves the two glaring questions facing “DMV's” first season: Can the visual template lighten up enough to disassociate a fun network sitcom from its infamous real-world setting, and can it seed enough rich material for Meadows (and the rest of the cast) to open up like we know he can? Speaking to the former point, it's great that “DMV” evokes an actual DMV — having been to a few in the greater Los Angeles area, the show's soundstage could sub in for any one of them — but the bleak overhead lighting, dark walls, and black office furniture take things a step too far. A comedy stage still needs to be inviting, even if the place it's modeled after isn't.

As for Meadows, he does get the biggest laugh of the first two episodes, so there's hope. Writers need time to get to know their stars' strengths, even if those stars have been brightening our screens for decades. “DMV” just needs a little fine-tuning, and then we'll be able to tell if it's ready for what it's cast already deserves: a long road ahead.

“DMV” premieres Monday, October 13 at 8:30 p.m. ET on CBS. New episodes will be released weekly and available to stream on Paramount+.

Even though the theatrical event of 2025 — if not the year's true moment of poetic cinema — has come and gone, IndieWire must continue being a website and writing about obvious things like the VistaVision print of “One Battle After Another.” But it is worth reflecting on the former, by which we, of course, mean the limited theatrical run of The Onion mockumentary, “Jeffrey Epstein: Bad Pedophile.” 

The 20-minute short is now available for any American idiot to watch YouTube, but the team at the Onion recently screened it, along with the classic Onion limited series “Sex House,” in over 25 independent theaters across the country, from Birmingham, Alabama, to Duluth, Minnesota, and beyond.

The success of the one-night-only, self-described “Historic Cinematic Night of Film at the Movies” speaks not just to the credibility of America's Finest News Source, but of the increasing ease with which projects and exhibitors can directly collaborate to get around the usual film distribution channels — and any risk-aversion that may or may not come with them.  

 










Over the summer, The Onion team observed the staying power of the Epstein files as a news story and decided to commit the whole of their Onion News Network resources to creating a mockumentary around it and trying to make that film as big, ambitious, and wildly funny as the Chicago-based satire team could. The script came together in a matter of days. “I remember walking into the writers' room and seeing [the outline of the film]. On [beat] number eight or nine, it said ‘He went to heaven' with a frowny face. That's when I knew it was gonna be truly great,” Onion CEO Ben Collins told IndieWire. 

They'd even secured release for the short mockumentary through a major distributor. But in the wake of the shooting of Charlie Kirk, the distributor decided to walk away from the project. “Their PR team [must have] refused to watch the movie because they kept asking if Donald Trump was in it. And we were like, ‘Yeah. But he's on the Knicks.' Like, it's not [real]… I think it's weird that you would see the name ‘Jeffrey Epstein' and immediately associate it with the president and all of his friends. But it is what it is,” Collins said. 

Luckily for The Onion team, they didn't have to leave one of their most ambitious video projects at “it is what it is.” CMO Leila Brillson was determined to pursue independent theatrical screenings, partnering with indie theaters across the country. “What's exciting about this process is that it was a bummer to find ourselves holding the bag on something, but we also created our own pipeline, which was really exciting. We created our own relationships with these theaters that we were able to pump this out without relying on anyone except the technology that exists to send this to each other,” Brillson told IndieWire.     

 










It was as simple as emailing jeffreyepstein@theonion.com for independent theaters to request the DCP (Digital Cinema Package, the kind of file used to play movies on digital projectors) on Friday, October 2. Both Onion CEO Ben Collins and CMO Leila Brillson told IndieWire they were blown away by the response and by what building their own distribution pipeline could unlock for The Onion in the future. 

“There is a feeling that there's not a lot to rally around right now. Providing that kind of catharsis is so important to our readers and our audience. And once we took a look at this thing and laughed our faces off, we knew we had the opportunity to bring people together and have a rallying cry, flashpoint moment that we can point to this single, particular date and give people something they can all go to as a group,” Brillson said. 

Once The Onion team put out the call, they found out they had friends (with access to independent theaters) everywhere. “Within 24 hours, we had dozens of requests all throughout the world to show this thing locally,” Collins said. “We're letting [the indie theaters] keep the gate. We're letting them donate it to charity, do whatever they want to do with it. We're doing it exclusively so people see the film and to support a difficult ride indie theaters [have had] in the last few years as well.” 

 










“Three cities in Missouri are screening this film, and I just think that's really exciting and really speaks to the pockets of interest that you kind of forget about when you're subsumed into this mass mediated space,” Brillson added. “But there are people who are ready to watch something like this that is a little out of left field.” 

The motto of The Onion is “Tu stultus es” (roughly, “You are stupid”), but both Brillson and Collins told IndieWire that screening something like “Jeffrey Epstein: Bad Pedophile” proves you don't have to over-engineer “content” to be value-neutral slop in order to garner an audience, whatever the demographic breakdown. 

“I actually say this all the time to Ben — because there is that anti-woke crowd that is so loud, we feel like there's this massive shift and we are watching theater chains and people making the economic decisions — marketers, media buyers, whoever — make this huge shift to the right. And you know, it doesn't make a tremendous amount of economic sense,” Brillson said. “Actually having some values works. And the nice thing is, all of the people going to this are supporting indie theaters. They're giving their money directly to these people who get to keep it.” 

 










“The comedy that you see that's very paid for, that's very expensive? The, you know, Riyadh Comedy Festival thing that's going on? Those people have pretended to be censored and had a really hard time, like their speech is being taken away, but they're being paid millions of dollars by the richest people in the world to protect the status quo. And most people want something like [‘Jeffrey Epstein: Bad Pedophile'],” Collins added. “Actual people will drive out of their way, will beg their theaters to air something this stupid. That's where the actual populace is. That's where real America is. It's not with this other, very contrived, anti-woke thing that's been going on for the last few years.” 

As it so often is, The Onion is right — We are stupid, and the key to making good things is in figuring out how to come together with other (stupid) people. “We feel like we had a cheat code, I think, with rebuilding the newspaper last year. We had to do the same thing. We didn't even know there were middlemen that would go and make you a newspaper and cut off, you know, half your profits. We just went to the place out by O'Hare Airport that makes newspapers and asked, ‘Would you guys print something for us?,'” Collins said. “The whole thing feels kind of charmed.”

 










“Jeffrey Epstein: Bad Pedophile” is now available to stream on YouTube.

Finally, something to look forward to in the bitter days of late winter. Netflix announced early Monday morning that its smash hit series “Bridgerton,” based on the beloved romance novels from Julia Quinn, will return in early 2026. Well, with a caveat: like Season 3, Season 4 will arrive in two parts.

The streamer has announced that Part 1 of the season, including the first four episodes, will drop on January 29, 2026, with Part 2 (also four episodes) following on February 26, 2026. Netflix previously employed a similar release strategy with Season 3 in 2024, splitting that season over two releases during early summer. Talk about delaying the gratification!

During a February event held in London, current showrunner Jess Brownell teased that the forthcoming season is the “Bridgerton” season most “faithful” to the respective novel, and one that will kick off with a masquerade ball. (Still, we previously wondered just how faithful this season will be, considering some sticky elements of the novel.)

Per this season's official logline: “The fourth season of ‘Bridgerton' turns its focus to bohemian second son Benedict (Luke Thompson). Despite his elder and younger brothers both being happily married, Benedict is loath to settle down — until he meets a captivating Lady in Silver at his mother's masquerade ball.” “The theme of the season is really about true love being somewhere in between fantasy and reality,” Brownell also noted.

In May, the streamer announced that the fifth and sixth seasons of the smash hit had been greenlit, though it's unclear which siblings they will focus on and when they will arrive.

This season stars Luke Thompson (Benedict Bridgerton), Yerin Ha (Sophie Baek), Jonathan Bailey (Anthony Bridgerton), Victor Alli (Lord John Stirling), Adjoa Andoh (Lady Danbury), Julie Andrews (Lady Whistledown), Lorraine Ashbourne (Mrs. Varley), Masali Baduza (Michaela Stirling), Nicola Coughlan (Penelope Bridgerton), Hannah Dodd (Francesca Stirling), Daniel Francis (Lord Marcus Anderson), Ruth Gemmell (Violet Bridgerton), Florence Hunt (Hyacinth Bridgerton), Martins Imhangbe (Will Mondrich), Claudia Jessie (Eloise Bridgerton), Luke Newton (Colin Bridgerton), Golda Rosheuvel (Queen Charlotte), Will Tilston (Gregory Bridgerton), Polly Walker (Portia Featherington), Emma Naomi (Alice Mondrich), Hugh Sachs (Brimsley), plus Simone Ashley (Kate Bridgerton), Isabella Wei (Posy Li), Michelle Mao (Rosamund Li), and Katie Leung (Lady Araminta Gun).

Even a Magic 8 Ball couldn't have seen this one coming. “The Sixth Sense” director M. Night Shyamalan is set to direct a series for Mattel Studios based on its Magic 8 Ball toy. 

In an Instagram post announcing the project — certainly a twist from one of the masters of them if there ever was one — Shyamalan said he's been “working on this for a couple years.” 

Brad Falchuk, known as a writer on “Glee,” “American Horror Story,” and “Pose,” is serving as the writer, co-creator, and co-showrunner of the series, and it's currently in development. The live-action series is being described by Mattel as meant to place Magic 8 Ball “as the centerpiece of a high-concept, character-driven supernatural drama that blends psychological intensity with cultural intrigue.”

That actually signals to us that this is not strictly a kids series based on a toy. In fact, there were a lot of skeptics when “Barbie” was first put into development by Mattel. So would “Magic 8 Ball” have an equal chance of surprising audiences, blending some shameless commercialism with a highly talented auteur director? 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






If we asked the Magic 8 Ball, we think it might say “Reply hazy, try again.” 

Since “Barbie” opened in 2023, Mattel and chief Robbie Brenner have been kicking around a number of different films and series, many of which have yet to materialize. In post-production now are “Masters of the Universe” from Laika filmmaker Travis Knight, which is a live-action film that brings the He-Man and Skeletor characters to life and is set at Amazon MGM, and also “Matchbox,” which is an action film set at Apple based on the toy cars that stars John Cena. 

But there's a number of others that are in early stages that have us asking the Magic 8 Ball for some guidance. There's an “American Girl” series that sounds an awful lot like a recent “SNL” sketch, a live-action “Barney” movie that originally had Daniel Kaluuya attached but is now being written by Ayo Edebiri, Jon M. Chu and J.J. Abrams' “Hot Wheels” movie, “Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots” with Vin Diesel, “Polly Pocket” starring Lily Collins and produced by Reese Witherspoon after Lena Dunham exited, and at one point a “Thomas & Friends” movie that was meant to be directed by Marc Forster, to name just a few.

It's hard to not point to Martin Scorsese directing the “Kool-Aid” movie on “The Studio” and just write this off, but Mattel with “Barbie” quickly proved to be the test case other companies are looking to when it comes to pairing brands with entertainment in more subtle ways. 

 










For Shyamalan, this marks his return to TV after directing and EP'ing “Servant” for Apple, and his last film was “Trap,” which grossed $84 million worldwide. Not counting something like “Glass” that is a sequel to “Unbreakable,” you'd have to go all the way back to “The Last Airbender” in 2010 to find an example where Shyamalan was a director-for-hire working on some existing IP. That movie made $320 million but would be safe to say it was not among his better films.

October 13, 2025

I was in for a rude awakening when I went to a Che show in Brooklyn a couple weeks ago. I observed from the venue's balcony as the Atlanta rapper strutted onstage, pleading for mosh pits and making devil horns with his fingers. “Open that shit up!” Che snarled, over and over again. He was so hellbent on manufacturing the destruction his music encouraged that it soon became obvious he was barely even rapping his songs. After a while it felt awkward, almost like the crowd was meant to perform for him. And listen, I get it: The bloodcurdling shrieks and 808 avalanches are meant to inspire group catharsis. Everybody who makes “rage” rap performs with this in mind. But all I could think was, Damn, when is my generation gonna move on from biting Carti?

If there's anyone who can propel rage in a new direction, it's OsamaSon. The South Carolina rapper has already inspired copycats of his own. But engaging with the scene necessarily means brushing past whichever version of Playboi Carti its leaders are currently modeling themselves after—Osama included. No matter how effective the execution, this process is getting monotonous. There's a beauty and a curiosity in dissecting references that feel distant. That feeling is extremely rare in rage rap—everything sprouts from low-hanging fruit: Rolling Loud clips, Hot Topic merch, Opium archive pages. So when Osama dropped Jump Out in January, the way he was evolving got me out of my seat: He sustained his melodies with a puerile, sing-songy twang; his cyborgian cadence departed from Carti's alien lilt; his beats were at times sludgier and more neurotic. On his new record, psykotic, OsamaSon doesn't lean any further into the orbit of his lodestar, but he isn't leaving it either.

It's a frustrating dynamic for a release that arrives at the apex of his career so far. Instead of affirming OsamaSon as a unique entity in his own lane, psykotic refurbishes his comfort zone. “Whats Happening” is immediately one of the hardest tracks in O's catalog, its choppy synth lurch reminiscent of Osama Season's 8-bit churn. At its core are hypercompressed murmurs from Gucci Mane's “Shirt Off,” punctuated by Osama's screwfaced chirrups. Central to the track, though, is a hook familiar enough to send shockwaves: “I take my shirt off and all the hoes stop breathin'.” For a moment as cool as this to also be potentially inspired by Whole Lotta Red is deflating. I almost wanna wipe that album from my memory just so I can experience this with rose-tinted glasses.

I first heard psykotic on CD—the label was so scared of leaks they refused to send a digital stream–and the earbuds and Walkman I received with it were barely built for the muggy distortion baked into the production. Ten seconds into the intro's wormhole of clipping tumult, I honestly thought producer Warren Hunter broke the Walkman. The lowend claps crammed into its rhythmic nexus are the only sounds that made it out alive. Hunter also helms “FMJ” and “Get away,” tracks whose clumps of 808 fuzz land like brass knuckles to the spleen. If production like this wasn't all over Ken Carson's More Chaos, it'd hit even harder, but then again, he and Osama have been swapping similar beats from the same producers since 2023. All the more reason to pivot in a new direction. Not all beats here are weapons of mass destruction, though: producer ok's breezy Pi'erre Bourne replica, “She woke Up,” is disappointing; Rok and Gyro's synth-encrusted utopia, “yea i kno” is staggering.

Vocal dynamism is what gives psykotic its style. OsamaSon's accounts of moving bricks and letting bullets fly have never seemed believable, but the way he contorts his pitch and manipulates the cracks in his voice turns his role-playing into must-see TV. He's been honing that pitched-down croak on “Maag Dump” since last year's face-scrunching “just score it.” When his voice is pitched up, like on “Function” or “Gintama,” he sounds so geeked up he might pop. Osama is at his most earnest when he yearns for private affection on “In It” and “Get away,” the latter spotlighting him at his most despondent. Rap-singing a hook that's more Chino Moreno than Jordan Carter, he's never sounded this honest: “I know it's all yours/You never called for it/Sometimes I feel like that you didn't wanna walk for it/Didn't wanna crawl for it/I put in my all for it.”

As a record, psykotic mostly accomplishes what it sets out to do, and yet it's hard to shake my cynicism. At its peak—thinking of “Habits,” “Addicted,” and that run from “In It” to “Whats Happening”—it's fevered and galvanic, like how it feels to be so fried you can't tell if you're scared shitless or having the time of your life. But OsamaSon and his collaborators seem determined to route that turbulent energy… right back to his starting point. On “FMJ,” Osama's stone-cold, dreary-eyed drone holds firm in the face of 808 torrents and synth trills. What follows is a surprise verse from Che, who's been rapping like he just rediscovered “JumpOutTheHouse” and can't get it out of his head. His Auto-Tuned yelps, meant to feel exhilarating, instead feel laborious, especially when you know he's talented enough to cultivate something original. In a sudden shift mid-verse, Che swaps his WLR impression for a stoic, guttural warble that lasts no more than three seconds. “I was with Lil O/We got O's/Smokin' buku bitches,” he intones, briefly treading a new path before retreating back to safety. On paper, the line means nothing, but its delivery suggests salvation from déjà vu. Or maybe that's wishful thinking.

The new artists of our time should be taking pride in subverting the formulas of their predecessors. Kill your fucking idols! Remember when Young Thug wanted to one-up his GOAT Lil Wayne so bad that he tried to drop Tha Carter VI before him? What resulted from that turned out to be more subversive and more iconic than anything Weezy has dropped since. Someone let the kids know they're just as capable of pulling that off.

Tara Lily, the British-Bengali musician who's based in South London, has shared a new song featuring King Krule dubbed “Tropical Storm.” She describes the mellow collaboration with Archy Marshall as being “a lucid dream playing in our minds again and again.” Give the song a listen below.

“Tropical Storm” is the lead single from Lily's upcoming record Quiet Nights (Early Takes). That four-song EP is out November 7 via Tru Thoughts. Discussing the upcoming record, Lily said, “Quiet Nights are some of the early sketches from a deadly quiet and beautiful period of time. For myself it was a time of stripping back, dropping down into the ground and channelling something raw and real.” Her debut album, Speak in the Dark, came out last year.

King Krule's most recent album Space Heavy, in which he sung about love and his newfound status as a father, came out in 2023. He followed up that fourth studio LP with the concert film You'll Never Guess What Happened Next that same year, and then the four-song Shhhhhhh! EP in 2024.

Considering the essential role that drum machines play in egg punk, it's a bit of a shock that Snooper—arguably the genre's biggest band right now—never used one until the end of last year. While swinging from one tour route to another, all while punching in at their day jobs, the Nashville five-piece suddenly found the beating heart of egg punk sitting in their lap. Singer Blair Tramel and guitarist Connor Cummins started writing songs synced to the hardline rhythms of a vintage Zoom MRT-3, drawn to the propulsive nature of an intentionally repetitive structure. Worldwide, the culmination of those brainstorm sessions, is expectedly jacked up and alert. It's the beefy older brother to 2023's slinky art-kid debut Super Snõõper, but Snooper's unwieldy creativity bends its rigidity into moments of zany malleability.

As if powered by a metronome plugged into a high-voltage outlet, Snooper hit the ground running on Worldwide and never stop across its 28-minute runtime, turning into varsity sprinters with a cross-country runner's endurance. From the descending, jittery melody in opener “Opt Out” to the gloomy '80s bass casting a British new-wave shadow over “Worldwide,” each member of Snooper—Tramel, Cummins, guitarist Conner Sullivan, bassist Happy Haugen, and drummer Brad Barteau—vaults through a series of musical high-knees and shuttle lines. If their aerobic endorphins weren't already infectious, Snooper kick it up a notch with electronics on “Star 69” and “Pom Pom.” “They made me the team captain/And told me, ‘Make it happen,'” Tramel chants during the latter. Her teammates fortify the pep rally: pulling guitar strings across the fretboard, splicing drum beats into lightening-fried stutters, layering dog barks like cymbal hits.

Snooper thrive when locking eyes with the listener and tapping their wristwatch. On “Company Call” and “On Line,” they add gloss to both re-recorded versions from last year's split 7"" with Prison Affair, letting Haugen and Barteau steer with a thundering bassline and the accoutrements of a full drum kit determined to render the drum machine obsolete. There's no Pro Tools trickery speeding up the tempo without altering the pitch; Snooper really are playing that fast, and they've got the bloody fingers to prove it. The album's best sprint is an unlikely cover of the Beatles' “Come Together.” Snooper smash their pointer finger on the fast forward button of a CD player, zipping through the Abbey Road single in highlight reel-style. The all-timer bassline waggles in Haugen's hands like that old rubber pencil trick, the guitars wait on the sidelines for the riff-ready chorus, and sparse drums more than halve the original's runtime. It'd be a perplexing cover if not for how well the imagery aligns with the papier-mâché puppets of Snooper's concerts: juju eyeballs, holy roller getup, hair down to his knee (singular).

Despite its musical brevity, Worldwide is the wordiest batch of songs Tramel has ever written. After years of hearing fans scream lyrics back at her, the vocalist fine tuned her phrasing to champion the importance of cheering yourself on, learning how to use your voice, and seizing the benefits of pressure before it squishes you flat. “Where did all these words come from? Were they borrowed from someone?” Tramel wonders in “Guard Dog,” as if stunned by her own poetic license. By letting herself go long, though, Tramel finds a new way to inject Snooper's songs with unpredictable pathways while the rhythms otherwise stay locked in a groove.

But what happens to all that reclaimed time? Snooper wind it around their shoulders like arcade tickets, march up to the prize counter, and cash it in for an album-ending psych-rock blowout. “Relay” switches from a gritty rock song to a sassy riff immersed in fuzz. It moves cleanly into the four-minute closer “Subdivison”—sprawling for egg punk—that embarks on a heady, rhythm section-focused exodus akin to the driving garage rock of Osees. During the song's claustrophobic extended jam, Snooper find a new side of themselves willing to breathe mid-song to build tension. Recorded with John Congleton, marking the band's first time working with a studio producer, Worldwide fortifies Snooper's sound by forcing the stiff loops of a drum machine to warp under the weight of their ricocheting guitars. Studio time didn't kill the punk band. It granted them space to play faster and looser without losing any of the fun.

Klein used to work as a “logger” on a reality TV show, where she would record what cast members were doing in excruciating detail for use in B-roll shots. It's a detail I can't get out of my head, because not only is it hilarious, but there's also something obsessive and mundane about it: Here's one guy going to sleep, here's another person starting an argument. In an interview with Pitchfork, Klein noted how easily TV can be manipulated by people willing to distort the narrative, as when her fellow loggers would exclude activities by certain actors to make them look bad.

Klein is the complete opposite. She puts everything out as it comes, raw and unfiltered. It's obsessive and mundane in a different way, suffused with meaning even at its most impenetrable. After two albums of searing guitar noise, sleep with a cane feels like a retreat into the shroud of her earlier work. She finds solace, and intrigue, in the billowing folds of ambient music, but also in the sounds around her: her family, her house, the street. She's her own logger, cataloguing moods and feelings with a comprehensiveness that would be exhausting if it weren't so compelling.

In a quote to HotNewHipHop (she is signed to Roc Nation, after all), Klein calls sleep with a cane a “coming of age” release, and also a mixtape. It's a mixtape in the sense that it's not meant as a cohesive album, rather a grab bag of assorted goodies that amounts to “an epic ambient tape,” also her words. The irony is that in its patient, almost tender 91-minute sprawl, sleep with a cane is actually one of her more well-rounded and definitive releases. There is an epic scope to tracks like “it is what it is in d minor,” a 13-minute drone track based around a distant piano that sounds like an exploded version of her modern classical suite Harmattan.

Klein's musical world has always been porous, as she flits from modern classical to post-club to drone and whatever you call her On the Radar freestyle, where she Auto-Tune raps about “mini-mes” and staying at the bottom, before a guitar break marries the stabby freeform spray of late-'60s Neil Young solos with the buzzsaw tones of early '90s Darkthrone. The longer tracks on sleep with a cane, like the despondent and searching “Family Employment 2008-2014” or the 10-minute Ecco2k collaboration that reminds me of a ketted-out version of the “Justin Bieber 800% Slower” video, are broken up by bits of distortion or periodic crawls into hidey-holes. “bruk promise” sounds like a microphone caught in a dust storm, and some fetchingly weird guitar playing is broken up by what could be fireworks or gunshots on the desolate “for 6 guitar, damilola.” It's a tribute to a murdered London schoolboy that feels both devastating and obtuse, in classic Klein fashion. A promised collab with Manchester ambient stars Space Afrika manifests as a 16-second snippet with some unintelligible dialogue, while “score for J” has some Springsteenian harmonica, mournful and anthemic, undergirding a track that barely holds itself together. It's a lot at once, but it makes a weird sort of sense in Klein's world, blurring humor, absurdity, and grief in a way that feels like the exact opposite of irony.

Listening to sometimes impenetrable records like sleep with a cane, it's important to remember two things about Klein: One, she's funny as hell. Second, her music always means something. It's never weird for the sake of being weird. “Informa,” one of the album's most unnerving tracks, originally appeared as part of an entertaining online lecture that Klein gave for Frankfurt's Städelschule; the track wrestles with a line from a news broadcast about young artists who are “leaving violence behind” for “creativity and independence,” with a belligerent repetition that borders on the Bluntian. Klein chose the quote as a means to address how people often see her as some sort of diamond in the rough, an exceptional case, as a young Black woman from South London making a style of music more associated with academic institutions than anything closer to what she grew up on.

But it doesn't feel like she's making music for anyone but herself, and it's an immense privilege to hear it. With her fiery guitar largely relegated to the background, sleep with a cane is a softer release, but it's hardly relaxing. It closes with “rich dad poor dad,” the closest thing here to hip-hop, mainly because it has intelligible lyrics. The instrumental sounds like a cloud-rap production blown to smithereens and slowed to a crawl, with Klein's vocal wobbling over top: “My mum comes down and says, ‘Birds are watching'/I look around our home is burning/Another gone/Another dying,” she says, voice breaking on the word “crossroads,” repeated like a hymn.

Is the crossroads of “rich dad poor dad” meant to evoke the crossroads of Robert Johnson, another artist who bared his soul on records that seemed made for his own personal universe, logging his own actions and obsessions for the rest of the world to see? I'm not sure it matters. It's hard to compare Klein to anyone else at this point. She's the lead in her own imaginary reality show, where a genius making strange, unstructured music becomes a superstar beloved by people from all backgrounds. Listening to sleep with a cane, that scenario doesn't seem so made-up.

The following is adapted from Master Plan: The Hidden Plot to Legalize Corruption in America, the new book from David Sirota's investigative newsroom, The Lever. Click here for a discount and a free e-book version.


	On the 20th anniversary of the creation of the Roberts Supreme Court, one point of consensus persists: Most Americans believe money corrupts the political process — and they want to overturn the Citizens United precedent that empowers oligarchs to buy elections. 


	And yet, in two little-noticed cases — including one spearheaded by Vice President J.D. Vance — the high court could soon do the opposite, eliminating the last restrictions on campaign donations and obstructing law enforcement's efforts to halt bribery. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	As we recount in our new book Master Plan, the Citizens United case was the culmination of conservatives' 50-year master plan to deregulate the campaign finance system and legalize corruption. What started as an incendiary memo from soon-to-be Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell became one ruling equating money with constitutionally protected speech and another extending personhood rights to corporations. 

	











	Soon after John Roberts and Sam Alito were installed on the court two decades ago, they helped deliver the apotheosis: 2010's Citizens United opinion manufacturing the legal fiction that spending by — and donations to — allegedly independent political groups cannot be limited because those expenditures “do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.”

	











	Though Citizens United unleashed a 28-fold increase in election spending, the ruling preserved the legality of campaign contribution limits. But they could now be destroyed by Vance's case aiming to reverse a 2001 Supreme Court ruling and eliminate restrictions on political parties' coordinated spending with candidates. If those rules are killed off, party committees could become pass-through conduits for big donors to circumvent donation limits and deliver much larger payments in support of lawmakers who can reward them with government favors.

	Once again, the master planners are conjuring a legal fiction — House Republicans' amicus brief insists that because parties pool money from many contributors, that “significantly dilutes the potential for any particular donor to exercise a corrupting influence over any particular candidate” who ultimately benefits from their cash. In essence, they're asking justices to believe a bank CEO's donation to a political party coordinating with a lawmaker's campaign can in no way influence how that lawmaker drafts banking legislation. 


	A robust argument for preserving the existing restrictions is certainly possible — but the defense side of the case has already been thrown into chaos. After Donald Trump was sworn in, his solicitor general ended the Justice Department's support of the current law and joined with the plaintiffs attacking it. The Supreme Court then assigned the defense to a conservative lawyer who served as Chief Justice Roberts' clerk when he engineered the original Citizens United ruling. This same conservative attorney charged with defending the last remaining campaign finance statutes recently pressed justices to limit the scope of federal anti-bribery laws, which are now also in the legal crosshairs.


	In a concurrent case unfolding amid Washington's bacchanal of self-enrichment scandals, Cincinnati's former Democratic city councilman P.G. Sittenfeld is asking the Supreme Court to overturn his bribery conviction after an FBI sting caught him accepting a $20,000 campaign contribution in exchange for supporting a local development project.

	Notably, Sittenfeld has already been pardoned by Trump, making him by his own admission the first person in history to appeal a case he's already been absolved from.  He is receiving pro bono legal counsel from the most Trump-connected law firm in America, he is being personally represented by Trump's former solicitor general, and his appeal is being supported by an army of former elected officials. 

	











	Those circumstances and all that legal firepower make clear that this is less about one shady municipal deal and more about broadening a string of rulings making it increasingly impossible to prosecute public corruption cases. 


	That decade-long line of jurisprudence has seen the Supreme Court overturn bribery convictions of former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, aides to then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and associates of former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, narrowing the definition of what an “official act” in a quid pro quo situation is. Building off that, the court then declared that a public official reaping a payment from the recipient of government contracts is not engaging in illegal bribery, but is merely accepting a legal “gratuity.” 


	Taken together, the story is as sordid as it seems: As some justices were secretly accepting gifts from billionaires, they were using these cases to rule that the real problem in American politics is not egregious corruption, but instead overly stringent anti-corruption laws. 


	“Our concern is not with tawdry tales of Ferraris, Rolexes, and ball gowns,” wrote Chief Justice Roberts when he tossed McDonnell's conviction. “It is instead with the broader legal implications of the government's boundless interpretation of the federal bribery statute.”


	“You can buy influence all you want,” former Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney David Devillers told us when asked to summarize the effect of these rulings. “You can buy someone a yacht but if there's no quid pro quo tied to it, there's no official act tied to it, then it's not a federal crime.” 


	This might explain why law enforcement officials declined to charge Trump's prospective border czar Tom Homan when the FBI reportedly caught him accepting a bag full of $50,000 in cash from those seeking government contracts from a future Trump administration. With America's anti-corruption laws weakened, a Justice Department official didn't deny the veracity of the reporting, he instead insisted the events represented “no credible evidence of any criminal wrongdoing” — a talking point now being echoed by Vance. 


	As Trump now dismantles the Justice Department unit that prosecutes public corruption, Sittenfeld's appeal aims to take the Supreme Court's legal assault on anti-bribery laws even farther. In legal briefs, his lawyers are offering a novel theory: they insinuate that pay-to-play culture is now so pervasive that it should no longer be considered prosecutable.

	











	Citing Trump reportedly asking oil executives for $1 billion of campaign cash in exchange for government favors, Sittenfeld's Supreme Court petition laments that “prosecutor could doubtless present this meeting alone as at least ambiguous evidence of a quid pro quo.” The petition then asserts that if Sittenfeld's conviction is allowed to stand, “politicians are open to prosecution if they say anything during these often informal, unscripted conversations that can be read to even hint at a possible quid pro quo.”


	In past eras, the Supreme Court might be expected to evaluate the merits of the Vance and Sittenfeld cases, and issue narrow rulings honoring past precedents. But in the Roberts Court era, judicial respect for so-called stare decisis has often been jettisoned on campaign finance matters.


	Consider the tactics of the backers of Citizens United: They manufactured a fight with federal officials over the classification of a little-noticed documentary film not so much because they cared about the movie, but because they saw a chance to elicit a corruption-legalizing scheme they knew Congress would never legislate. Indeed, the case was meticulously engineered to give the newly conservative court the opportunity not merely to arbitrate the minor dispute, but to instead ignore stare decisis and “go big,” as one of the case's architects told us.


	It's the same dynamic today: Conservative groups behind today's two new cases undoubtedly hope that their spats over the esoterica of campaign finance and bribery law prompt the even-more-conservative court to not merely mediate these specific conflicts, but to instead issue broad rulings incinerating any remaining deterrents to pay-to-play corruption.


	And yet if plaintiffs get their way in these cases, all is not lost. 


	Yes, in buying elections, packing the courts, and eliciting precedents legalizing corruption, the master planners have created the democracy crisis, pushing America one step closer to the kleptocratic death spiral of history's collapsing empires. 


	But no, that freefall is not yet inevitable — before we hurtle over the precipice, there are still a few off ramps.


	One of them is a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United that would stop equating money with First Amendment-protected speech and allow our communities to restrict the flow of cash into politics. This may seem unrealistic because of the high threshold for ratification, but a growing number of states have already expressed support for such a measure, which was just reintroduced in Congress.

	











	Shorter term, another off ramp runs through Montana. Thirteen years after the Supreme Court gutted the state's century-old anti-corruption law, Montana luminaries of both parties are now spearheading a ballot initiative circumventing Citizens United jurisprudence and instead focusing on changing state incorporation laws that the high court rarely meddles with.


	The measure's proponents note that Citizens United is predicated on state laws giving corporations the same powers as actual human beings, including the power to spend on politics. But they point out that in past eras, state laws granted corporations more limited powers — and states never relinquished their authority to redefine what corporations can and cannot do. The Montana initiative proposes to simply use that authority to change the law — in this case, to no longer grant corporations the power to spend on elections. 


	If passed in Montana — and if other states follow — the initiative could profoundly change American politics. Corporations could still conduct all their normal business, but they would no longer have the power to buy elections or legislation. What's more, state laws' existing anti-circumvention provisions — which were recently upheld by the Supreme Court — would deny those powers to out-of-state businesses, too. Though wealthy people would still retain their right to individually spend on politics, the new corporate codes would eliminate dark money groups, forcing oligarchs to emerge from anonymity and do their election spending through political committees requiring full disclosure. 


	To be sure, that still leaves the problem of billionaires using their outsized wealth to finance ad campaigns, demonize their opponents, amplify their puppets, and effectively control the election discourse. But here too the post-Citizens United world still permits a local solution: publicly financed campaigns that provide candidates with at least enough resources to make their voices heard.


	In 14 states and 26 cities of varying partisan complexion, governments offer qualifying candidates either grants or small-dollar matching funds. Unlike cash from private donors, this public money does not come with the quid-pro-quo expectation of legislative favors. Though the Supreme Court once attempted to limit the reach of these systems, the high court has never outlawed them — in fact, justices explicitly declared “we do not today call into question the wisdom of public financing as a means of funding political candidacy.”

	











	These systems are no panacea — they still let self-financed billionaire candidates and super PACs outspend publicly funded candidates. But for a relatively small investment of public money, more states and cities can create their own public financing systems that provide grassroots candidates enough resources to run competitive campaigns without having to succumb to legalized corruption and sell their future actions to prospective campaign contributors. 


	In a healthy republic, these straightforward initiatives would be on a glidepath. But at this dark hour for democracy, they face the daunting task of overcoming powerful interests profiting off the current system. They also face the formidable challenge of breaking through all the noise and convincing the country that corruption isn't an academic issue or a low-level concern — it is the crisis creating every other problem.  


	“Corruption is why they just defunded nursing homes to cut taxes for the rich,” Georgia's Democratic Sen. John Ossoff recently said. “Corruption is why you pay a fortune for prescriptions. Corruption is why your insurance claims keep getting denied. Corruption is why hedge funds get to buy up all the houses in your neighborhood driving you out of the market and then your corporate landlord ignores your calls during a gas leak. Corruption is why that ambulance cost $3,000 after you just had to get your choking toddler to the hospital.” 


	Of course, it is comforting to think we can just sit back and passively wait for this corruption nightmare to pass when the Trump presidency ends or if party control of Washington changes. That promise will likely be Democrats' message in 2026 and 2028. 


	But conservatives, their oligarch benefactors, and the Supreme Court clearly have a master plan to try to lock in the kleptocratic status quo. 


	They know that in a functioning one-person-one-vote democracy, they could never pass the unpopular self-enriching policies they want — and so they know they must focus on preserving and expanding the precedents that permit them to buy American democracy.

Woody Allen, who regularly collaborated with Diane Keaton throughout her career, honored the actress following her death in a tribute published on The Free Press. The disgraced filmmaker shared his memories of Keaton, who appeared in movies like Annie Hall, Sleeper, Manhattan, and Love and Death. 


	“Unlike anyone the planet has experienced or is unlikely to ever see again, her face and laugh illuminated any space she entered,” Allen wrote. “I first laid eyes on her lanky beauty at an audition and thought, If Huckleberry Finn was a gorgeous young woman, he'd be Keaton.” 


	Allen described working with Keaton over the years, but also being her longtime friend. He wrote that her opinion was one of the only ones he trusted. “As time went on I made movies for an audience of one, Diane Keaton,” Allen wrote. “I never read a single review of my work and cared only what Keaton had to say about it. If she liked it, I counted the film as an artistic success. If she was less than enthusiastic, I tried to use her criticism to reedit and come away with something she felt better about.”

	











	He added, “She had huge talent for comedies and drama, but she could also dance and sing with feeling. She also wrote books and did photography, made collages, decorated homes, and directed films. Finally, she was a million laughs to be around.”

	Allen and Keaton were one-time romantic partners and stayed friends in the years after. He wrote numerous roles specifically for her to play, including the titular character in 1977's Annie Hall, for which she won Best Actress. Many speculated that the film was based on their prior relationship, although Keaton told The New York Times, “It's not true, but there are elements of truth in it.”

	











	He noted of her style, “Her fashion sense was a sight to behold, of course. Her sartorial concoctions rivaled the contraptions of Rube Goldberg. She put together clothing that defied logic but always worked. In later years, her look became more elegant.”

	In the tribute, Allen described his romantic relationship with Keaton, including recalling meeting her family. “This was Keaton's world, her people, her background,” he wrote. “It was amazing that this beautiful yokel went on to become an award-winning actress and sophisticated fashion icon. We had a few great personal years together and finally we both moved on, and why we parted only God and Freud might be able to figure out.”


	“She went on to date a number of exciting men, all of them more fascinating than I was,” Allen continued. “I went on to keep trying to make that great masterpiece that I am still struggling with when I last looked. I kidded Keaton that we'd wind up — she like Norma Desmond, me like Erich von Stroheim, once her director, now her chauffeur. But the world is constantly being redefined, and with Keaton's passing it is redefined once again. A few days ago the world was a place that included Diane Keaton. Now it's a world that does not. Hence, it's a drearier world. Still, there are her movies. And her great laugh still echoes in my head.”


	Allen has dogged controversy since having an affair with his partner Mia Farrow's adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn. During his custody battle with Farrow, she claimed Allen had “acted inappropriately” with her daughter, Dylan Farrow. Allen denied the accusations and married Previn, who he has been with for more than 20 years. The claims resurfaced during the #MeToo movement and Keaton took to social media to defend Allen. 


	“Woody Allen is my friend and I continue to believe him,” Keaton wrote. “It might be of interest to take a look at the 60 Minute interview from 1992 and see what you think.”

	In 2017, Allen made a rare appearance to present Keaton with the AFI Life Achievement Award. “The minute I met her, she was a great, great inspiration to me,” Allen said during the event. “Much of what I've accomplished in my life I owe, for sure, to her. Seeing life through her eyes. She really is astonishing. This is a woman who is great at everything she does.”

	Jon Blistein



Marc Maron has dropped the 1,686th and final episode of his long-running WTF podcast, with former President Barack Obama returning for Maron's last interview.


	Maron managed to keep the identity of his last guest a secret until the episode dropped Monday morning, Oct. 13. In introducing Obama — who famously appeared on the show 10 years ago — Maron described him as the perfect person to help him bring WTF to a close.


	As Maron said in his intro: “I do a lot of talking about how I feel about the world, both interior and exterior; micro, macro; what's going on in me, how am I reacting to what's going on in the world. And it became clear that the guest we needed to have was singular. In that he could address the importance of this being our final episode, but also address how we move through the world we're living in, as frightening as it is, with what's happening. And how do we do it with some grace, and perhaps some hope and some focus, and really call what's going on what it is. And that guest is President Barack Obama.”

	











	While Obama came to Maron's house for their 2015 chat, this time Maron visited the former president at his office in Washington, D.C. During the conversation, the pair spoke at length about Trump, the state of the Democratic Party, the weaponization of the justice system, and prominent institutions like universities and law firms kowtowing to the current administration.


	“We have blown through, just in the last six months, a whole range of not simply assumptions, but rules and laws and practices that were put in place to ensure that nobody is above the law, and that we don't use the federal government to simply reward our friends and punish our enemies,” Obama said. 

	











	He added that “people are right to be concerned,” but said that just like during the McCarthy era and at other contentious points in American history, “What's required in these situations is a few folks standing up and giving courage to other folks. And then more people stand up and go like, ‘Yeah, no, that's not who we are. That's not our idea of America.'”

	Maron also took the opportunity to ask Obama for some advice — not just on how to navigate this moment politically, but also personally. He asked the former president how he contended with the weight of leaving his biggest job ever, with Obama recalling some advice he got at the time: “Don't rush into what the next thing is.”


	He continued, “Take a beat and take some satisfaction. Looking back and saying, ‘You know what, didn't get everything done that I wanted; it wasn't always exactly how I planned it, but there's a body of work there that I'm proud of.'”

	Following the interview, Maron said he hoped the interview was “helpful,” while also calling it an “honor” to interview Obama again. He then signed off for the last time, thanking fans for all their support, the numerous people who'd helped him put on the show, and, lastly, his beloved cats, especially all those who'd passed away. 


	“Cat angels everywhere,” Maron said as the show drew to a close.

	After the revelation that Anthony Grasso (Fabien Frankel) is the mole on last week's episode of Task, the severity of his betrayal has now come to a head. During a tumultuous, action-packed series of events, Grasso is caught between his own FBI task force and the Dark Hearts motorcycle gang, to whom he has been feeding information. His decisions result in the death of his colleague and romantic interest, Lizzie Stover (Alison Oliver), and the suspicion of his boss, Tom Brandis (Mark Ruffalo), who has become like a father figure to Grasso. It's a devastating, and, for some, shocking turn of events — though the show's creator Brad Ingelsby says the seeds of Grasso's true allegiance have been planted all along.


	“You want to be able to rewatch it and go, ‘Oh, yeah, he was,'” Ingelsby says, speaking over Zoom. “There were things along the way so that when you get to the reveal it feels earned. One of the things we really wanted to lean into with Grasso was his loss of faith. He's really disillusioned, in a way that Tom is as well. I think when [the reveal] happens hopefully the audience can see how the institutions have failed him in some way. The things he held as truth in his life have failed him in some way. I was trying to lay it in pretty early so that when we get there it's not just a twist for the sake of having a twist.”

	











	Frankel credits Ingelsby's writing for the authenticity of Grasso's circumstances, which will be further explored in the series' final two episodes.

	“He writes incredibly intricately woven characters and enables an audience to discover them in real time without ever feeling like he's just laying in plot points,” Frankel says, speaking over Zoom separately. “He does it in humane ways, like developing the relationship with Lizzie, or developing the father-son bond that Grasso has with Mark's character. All those things inform who he is. So when you find out he's the mole, you already have an understanding of him and it just re-informs your understanding.”

	The scope and ramifications of Grasso's actions come to light early on in Episode Six. After a call from Tom, the task force heads out in search of Robbie (Tom Pelphrey). A showdown among the FBI, Robbie, and the Dark Hearts ensues, with several character ending up dead. The most tragic loss is Lizzie, a conflicted member of Tom's task force who is nervous in high-intensity situations. She finally confronts her fears and is crushed to death by a speeding car driven by the Dark Hearts. Ingelsby calls the decision to kill the character “heartbreaking” and compares it to the unexpected loss of Evan Peters' Detective Colin Zabel midway through his prior series Mare of Easttown.


	“I said to Fabien, ‘Imagine you have a house of cards and you're carefully tending to it and someone's thrown all the windows open in your house and you're trying to protect it,'” Ingelsby says. “[Grasso] needed consequences. He was able to very carefully handle this house of cards and steer the information this way. But eventually his decisions have to catch up with him. The consequence was that he was falling for this girl and he didn't save her.”


	“It will blindside the audience, and it will be a real sad moment in the story,” Frankel adds. “That's the culmination of a ton of things that have gone wrong all at once, and a vast majority of them are Grasso's fault, to a degree. Certainly he feels they're his fault. So for me [on set] it was allowing the weight of that to happen. But you hold Alison Oliver in your arms after she's been run over by a car and try not to feel a great deal of sadness.”


	Shooting the elaborate sequence in the woods was physically challenging for the cast and logistically challenging for the crew. Ingelsby says they looked around Pennsylvania for the right bridge for months.

	“I got quite nervous because I felt like, in a way I didn't while writing it, that the whole show was leading to that moment,” he says. “That became more and more palpable as we were moving into it. Like, if the whole show is leading to this big confrontation, we have to pay it off. Every character is there for a reason, doing something for a reason. Aleah is the sharpshooter. It's Lizzie's moment of courage. It's Grasso's house of cards crumbling. It's Tom finally coming out of his shell and beating up Perry. It's Robbie confronting his brother's killer, and ultimately dying at the hands of his brother's killer. All the arcs are hitting at that specific time. Emotionally, it had to work.”

	











	Unusually, Task hits its big climatic moment with two more episodes yet to air. But Ingelsby wanted the story to play out without culminating in an action sequence. “I felt like the show had to subvert expectations at times,” he explains. “As as a viewer, if I saw these scenes, I would get excited because I would go, ‘Oh, I thought those were going to be where the show was ending.' It braces you for something completely different. Why not do something that's unexpected and hopefully still emotional? Hopefully at the end of Episode Six, we still have enough investment from the audience to carry us through see what's going to happen in Seven.”


	Prior to Task, Frankel was best known for his role as Ser Criston Cole on HBO's House of the Dragon. The actor hails from London and has an extensive theater background, which may surprise some viewers of Task. It certainly surprised Ingelsby, who says he was “literally blown away” by the very particular Philadelphia accent Frankel learned for his audition.


	“I grew up a little west of Philly, but I spent a lot of time in the city, and South Philly was an area that I knew,” Ingelsby says. “And Jeremiah [Zager], our director, was actually raised in South Philly. So two of us had a very specific idea of what the character would look like and sound like. I didn't know [Fabien] is British. His audition felt like lightning, where you just go, ‘Oh, my god. This guy he looks the part, he sounds the part, I believe him as this character.' He was the perfect choice.”


	“He is being very kind,” Frankel says. “I came in with a version of a New York accent that I did. I was just doing an impersonation of every New York cop/gangster thing I'd ever watched.”


	After his audition, Ingelsby and Frankel had a “long, wine-fueled dinner” together in Philadelphia. It was then Ingelsby revealed Grasso's arc to the actor. “We spoke at length about it,” Frankel recalls. “We spoke in great detail about what it was going to be and who he was. Brad had such a clear idea of this person. The opening line of Brad's stage directions is something like, ‘Grasso puts out his big paw and shakes Aleah's hand.' I knew exactly who he was from that point.”


	It was important to Ingelsby to establish Grasso as someone the audience likes. The creator gave the character several endearing moments, including when he defends Lizzie in the cop bar and the revelation that he previously performed at Catholic events as DJ Grassanova. Ingelsby hopes that despite Grasso's bad choices, the audience still likes him the end of the show — or, at least, they can understand him.

	











	“His actions have caused awful things to happen to Lizzie,” Ingelsby says. “But we tried to approach every character with that in mind, even Robbie. We don't agree with all the things Robbie is doing, but why is he doing them? I felt the same way about Mare of Easttown. With Grasso, I want people to feel, ‘I don't like what he's done and the pain he's caused and the devastation of his actions, but I can at least understand why he's done these things.' All the characters in this show, in some way, are trapped in trying to get out of circumstances they've been both complicit in and not complicit in.”


	“If people hate Grasso by the end, then they hate Grasso,” Frankel says. “That's what good television is, right? It's polarizing. So if people want to dislike him, then they should, and they'd be in their right to. But if they want to feel the humanity in him, then they should. I don't feel the need to defend him because Brad's writing will do that on its own. When you watch Episode Seven, you'll have a much firmer understanding of what's behind the curtain.”


	At the end of Episode Six, Tom confronts Grasso, accusing him of being the mole. Grasso refuses to admit his guilt and encourages Tom to come after him. The scene wasn't in the original script; Ingelsby added it halfway through production.


	“That's what Brad does,” Frankel says. “Who writes a scene of that caliber halfway through filming a show? He goes, ‘I think we're missing a scene between Grasso and Tom, and I've just written the scene.' It was the best piece of writing I've ever gotten to deliver onscreen. In terms of the caliber of writing, I don't know that I've ever gotten a scene like that. I can't really envision how the episode was prior to that scene existing.”


	For several episodes, Grasso has confided in Tom, a former priest, and clearly admires him. Ingelsby wanted there to be a scene where Grasso almost dared Tom take him down.


	“We have to believe that Grasso has been at this for years,” Ingelsby says. “He's not going to cave so easily, right? And there's a reason he's gotten away with this in the past. I wanted it to be a scene that was infused with betrayal and pain, but also Grasso digging in and saying, ‘All right, well, let's see what you've got, Tom.' I wanted to end the episode on a moment of tension. How is Tom going to go after Grasso, and how is Grasso going try to maintain his innocence or try to evade scrutiny? It's its own little cliffhanger.”

	Ultimately, Task is about the power of forgiveness — a theme that carries through leading up to the finale. Tom needs to forgive his incarcerated son, and Grasso needs to forgive himself.


	“It's such a freeing thing, the ability to forgive people,” Ingelsby says. “If we could practice it in our everyday life more, I often think about how it would impact the people closest to us and and our interactions with our kids. It's such an important thing. It seems easy to talk about, but it's really, really hard for people to forgive. So why not make a show about that? If it inspires someone to be more willing to forgive, then maybe we've done our job. To lead with compassion and kindness and to let go of the shame and the anger, then maybe we've done something right.”

	Four couples had their first dance to the sound of Lucy Dacus‘ “Best Guess” as she performed the record on Jimmy Kimmel Live. At the end of the song, the singer-songwriter made a seamless transition to the vow portion of her appearance, where she officiated weddings for her on-stage guests.


	“Hi, everyone,” Dacus said. “You ready to get married?” The couple shared promises to give themselves to each other and to care for one another in their marriage, in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health. And with that said, they sealed their union with a kiss.


	“Best Guess” appears on Dacus' latest album, Forever Is a Feeling. “It's a song that is basically admitting that you can't control anything, you can't predict the future, but you can make your best guess,” she told The New York Times. 


	She performed the record at the New York iteration of All Things Go in September, inviting nine couples to the stage. Ordained by the Universal Life Church, she officiated at two of the marriages and signed the remaining seven wedding certificates as a witness.

	“I wish it was rote and it wasn't calling to mind any threats to people's rights,” Dacus said about officiating marriages in the midst of our current political climate. “But I can tell it's coming up in everyone's mind, everyone who's onstage, everyone in the crowd. There's no getting around everyone wondering if this is a temporarily possible moment.”

	











	In the caption of an Instagram post shared following the festival, Dacus wrote from the same place of optimism that colors “Best Guess.” “I am often in disbelief, disoriented, and overwhelmed,” she said, “but I am deeply in love with this life.”

CHARLESTON, W.Va –  With the fall season in full swing, West Virginians continue to look for things to do around the state, and tourism secretary Chelsea Ruby has a few ideas, including one that some may find a little out of the ordinary.

“Folks who are looking for trip ideas, I would recommend looking for the West Virginia swings, the Waterfall Trail, or even our new spooky Paranormal Trail. It's back for year two,” she said.

The West Virginia Paranormal Trail returns for its second year with different locations around the state for West Virginians and visitors to get some scares. Ruby says the project is a long time coming, and early numbers show it to be a smashing success.

“Our team kept coming to me each year saying, ‘We want to do a paranormal trail. We have so much going on in West Virginia,' so I finally leaned into the research and said, ‘This is a thing that people want to do,' so we're in year two. We just started the second year. We have had people from 48 states and eight countries start on this trail,” she said.

Locations on the West Virginia Paranormal Trail include the West Virginia Penitentiary, the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum, the Mothman Museum, and Seneca Caverns, among others. Explorers taking in the trail can redeem prizes for checking in at the different stops.

“If you go to a couple, you get a holograph sticker, a keychain, a lantern. You eventually can get a glow-in-the-dark hat so all kinds of fun prizes for exploring West Virginia,” Ruby said.

The trail is another addition to the fall activities that make West Virginia such a destination for people looking to spend some time outside during the season. Ruby encourages West Virginians to make the most of it.

“We're just used to it all, so my challenge to all West Virginians is to be appreciative of your state this fall,” she said.

A full list of destinations on the West Virginia Paranormal Trail is available at wvtourism.com.

Given the billions of Earth-Sun analogs in the Milky-Way galaxy, humanity is probably not at the top of the Galactic food chain.

We desperately need a dose of cosmic modesty. The answer to Enrico Fermi's question: “where is everybody?” is: “to find them, you need to be proactive and search for interstellar objects of technological origin”. The reply to Elon Musk's assertion “we are probably alone,” is: “do not be so presumptuous, as space entrepreneurs that are better than you probably lived in the Milky-Way for billions of years before you were born.” It is our scientific obligation to find the relics of these space entrepreneurs rather than brag about our cosmic importance without investing resources in the search for alien technological products. Whether they exist does not depend on what we tell each other, for the same reason that the Earth revolved around the Sun 4.54 billion times before the Vatican dismissed Nicolaus Copernicus for suggesting a heliocentric Solar system. The next Copernican revolution would involve the realization that humanity has siblings in the family of technological civilizations. These siblings might have existed for billions of years before humans emerged on Earth. Most of them did not only live but also died billions of years ago.

We are not at the center of the cosmic stage and we arrived late to the cosmic scene. Common sense suggests that we are not central actors in the cosmic play. If humanity were to die by self-inflicted wounds, geological activity would wipe out all of humanity's industrial scars on Earth's surface within millions of years. By the time the Earth will lose its water reservoirs to become a desert like Mars in a billion years — as a result of the brightening of the Sun (as calculated here), no visitor to the solar system would even notice that humans lived on Earth. A billion years amounts to just 7% of cosmic history. In the cosmic scheme of things, nobody would be aware of the loss of humanity … unless we send technological relics carrying our AI-descendants to interstellar space.

These technological relics will be the only clues that humanity could leave behind for future space archaeologists. By reciprocity, the search for similar relics is the best way for us to realize that other civilizations preceded ours by billions of years. How would we be perceived by others if they happened to monitor us?

To aliens, humanity might look like a toddler on the cosmic stage. Foolish and focused on itself, unaware of the experienced adults with bigger brains in the adjacent room.

In preparation for a 4-hour interview yesterday, I was asked to watch the film “2001: A Space Odyssey,” crafted by Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, in which humanity is viewed as a toddler with alien monoliths serving as monitors in its baby room. The creator of these monoliths appears in the image of God, resembling an adult in the adjacent room. This remarkable film envisioned the creation of AI systems which might have kinship to alien technologies more than to humans because they are made of silicon chips and not flesh and blood.

We must imagine possible realities in order to search for them. If we follow comet experts with the default assumption that all interstellar objects are comets, we might fall into the trap of insisting that spacecraft are “dark comets” because they do not show visible gas or dust around them. This is not a hypothetical concern. Currently, comet experts firmly argue that the first interstellar object 1I/`Oumuamua was a dark comet (as discussed here) and alternative interpretations of its unresolved anomalies (as discussed here) are ridiculed through personal attacks on those who dare to imagine something else.

In order not to miss clues offered by anomalies of technological objects relative to space rocks, we must imagine extraterrestrial technologies as a possibility. Our physical reality within the Milky-Way might be more imaginative than we are, because our training data set is limited to Earth and there is much more real estate in outer space.

Most astrobiologists are obsessed with the search for microbes and life-as-we-know-it. If instead, we were to hedge our bets and invest similar funds and research effort in the search for intelligent life, the reward could be greater. Finding new unimaginable technologies would inspire humanity to change priorities. Instead of investing 2.4 trillion dollars per year in military budgets worldwide, we might choose to invest a similar amount in space exploration.

It is our call. If we wish to be remembered within billions of years, we must venture into interstellar space. Any space relic that we leave behind will serve as testimony that the human spirit cannot be wiped out as easily as life can from the surface of planets like Earth or Mars.

Extraterrestrial life forms were not created equal. Those who were intelligent enough to leave relics in interstellar space elevated themselves to the status of major actors in the cosmic play. They might be remembered by space archaeologists. Our siblings might look differently, including forms of life as we-do-NOT-know-it.

It might be easier to identify interstellar objects of technological origin than to identify the subtle chemical fingerprints of familiar microbes in exoplanet atmospheres. These technological relics might show up as anomalous interstellar objects in the inner solar system — like the latest visitor 3I/ATLAS with its 7 anomalies (as discussed here).

It is the obligation of scientists to be intrigued by interstellar objects that appear unusually big and follow trajectories that are fine-tuned to encounter Solar system planets, as 3I/ATLAS appears to be. Will 3I/ATLAS take advantage of a gravitational assist from the Sun at perihelion on October 29, 2025 to make an Oberth maneuver (as discussed here)? If not, 3I/ATLAS will arrive within 54 million kilometers from Jupiter on March 16, 2026.

Yesterday, I also met at an MIT conference Scott Bolton who serves as the principal investigator of the Juno spacecraft near Jupiter — which will have an opportunity to probe 3I/ATLAS from up close in 5 months. Scott informed me that Juno will use its Waves dipole antenna and magnetic coil to search for radio emission from 3I/ATLAS in the frequency range of 50 hertz to 40 megahertz. Given the coincidence between the arrival direction of 3I/ATLAS into the Solar system and the direction of the enigmatic “Wow! Signal” detected in 1977 (as discussed here), it would be worthwhile to search for any anomalous radio emission from 3I/ATLAS.

As a toddler technological civilization, we must study in all possible ways the nature of objects that are entering into our baby room from the outside world.

Confirmed by NASA—the mysterious rocks on Mars could contain the clearest signs of extraterrestrial life yet

NASA could have found signs of life on Mars, but there's something wrong. It's true there's still no definite confirmation about this remarkable news, but Perseverance rover's findings are the most promising until now and could answer one of the most ancient questions of humanity: Was there life on the Red Planet once? So, let's see what NASA has to say about this ongoing topic this time.

The Perseverance rover, which reached Mars in 2021, is exploring an area called Jezero Crater. Billion years ago, this place was home to a huge lake with rivers.

Then, in 2024, the rover found a very special rock called ‘'Cheyava Falls'' and when scientists analyzed it they saw organic molecules (compounds that on Earth are related to life), ancient water signs, and curious mineral patterns in the shape of spots that could have been an ideal environment for microorganisms to exist.

Despite the excitement, NASA experts were very careful. The organic molecules do not always mean there has been life, sometimes they are formed due to natural chemical processes. This is why they decided to keep investigating.

After the initial finding, NASA announced that the rover had analyzed two new areas: Sapphire Canyon and Masonic Temple. In these places, the Perseverance discovered minerals called vivianite and greigite. The most shocking thing was that they were distributed inside the rocks.

The minerals showed a pattern known as the ‘'redox cycling'' which happens when electrons move between different chemical compounds. On Earth, this type of chemical reaction is used by many microorganisms to obtain energy.

Basically, the patterns found on Mars are similar to the ones that leave some types of bacteria on our planet.

Scientific Michael Tice, a geobiologist and astrobiologist at Texas A&M University, said the team was amazed when they first analyzed the rocks. “When the rover entered the Bright Angel area and started measuring the rocks, the team was immediately struck by how different they were from anything we had seen before,” Tice explained.

Tice added that while some chemical reactions can occur naturally, they usually require very high temperatures. But there's no evidence of heat in these samples — which means life could be the more likely explanation.

However, to be sure, scientists need to bring these samples back to Earth for deeper study. Only in advanced laboratories can they confirm whether the rocks' chemical signatures truly point to ancient life.

Even though the Perseverance took samples of the Martian floor, taking them back to Earth won't be easy. NASA and ESA (European Spatial Agency) were thinking about a collaborative mission to do it, called Sample Retrieval Lander, to take the samples back about the year 2033.

However, there's something that makes it difficult: U.S. President Donald Trump is reportedly planning major cuts to NASA's budget, which could delay or even cancel the mission entirely. On Earth, scientists could:

All of this could finally answer whether the possible biosignatures (signs of life) found on Mars are biological or purely geological.

For now, NASA scientists are excited but cautious. The new data might be the strongest clue yet that Mars once hosted life — but it's not proof.

Until then, Perseverance continues to explore, sending back images and data from the Martian surface. Every rock it studies brings us one step closer to understanding whether the red planet was once alive.

The question that has fascinated humans for centuries — “Are we alone?” — might finally have an answer buried in the dust of Mars.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","Writer-Director of Hulu's ‘Stay' Talks Bringing the Supernatural Thriller to Screen","https://www.horrorgeeklife.com/2025/10/13/hulu-stay-jas-summers-interview/","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 15:35:46 GMT","

Writer-director Jas Summers made his directorial debut in the new Hulu film Stay. It follows Kiara (Megalyn Echikunwoke), a PhD author, and Miles (Mo McRae), a former MMA fighter, as they face the end of their marriage. They encounter supernatural forces, shifting from fighting each other to fighting for their lives. To survive, they must conquer darkness with love.

Horror Geek Life spoke with Summers about navigating the supernatural thriller.

HGL: Where did the idea for Stay come from?

Jas Summers: The idea came from wanting to tell a really interesting love story and then putting it in a genre I never thought a love story would be in; I'd never seen one, so putting those two worlds together was kind of the start of the idea.

HGL: How did the rest of the film take shape beyond the premise? Was there a lot of planning, or did it come together as the film was unfolding?

Jas Summers: It took shape over many drafts, the first draft was that idea, and I wanted to add in the spirituality idea, the voodoo element, and building out that way. I figured it out as I was working on it in the writing; it became more of a personal story, with people that I know. My father is in there, my mother is in there, their experiences and influences on me, about struggles in life and love and misunderstandings. So it was during the script writing process, for sure. 

HGL: There are some great visual moments from start to finish. When you were mapping out the film, did you have an idea how you wanted the film to look visually, or did that evolve during the filming process?

Jas Summers: I had a strong sense from the start about putting them frame within frames, trapping them in the house, but inside the doorways, the hallways, things like that. Once we got cinematographer John Rosario on board, we started talking about the emotion of the film, the characters, that time period in their life, and how it would look. I had a strong idea of what I wanted, but it evolved as more creatives came on board. 

HGL: It goes without saying that everything you're describing is not an easy process, time and money being the big issues. What were the biggest challenges for you in making this film?

Jas Summers: Time and money (laughs). Of course, all filmmakers go through it. I wish I had more days, more time in a day, and the schedule was tough. Some of the stuff in the film was tough; characters had to switch out of being in the same scene to being in a different scene with different hair, makeup, wardrobe, all that stuff made it very challenging to get all those particular scenes done on that day. 

To me, I don't know how everyone else feels who's watching it, but it's a little bit of an action film, fight scenes, horror, we had a lot of genres, and for a first-time filmmaker to attempt that was a lot. So yeah, time and money, but more so, time was the big one. 

HGL: You have two actors, Megalyn Echikunwoke and Mo McRae, carrying the film. What was it like working with them, collaborating on this project?

Jas Summers: It was amazing. I had seen Mo's work in American Skin; he had the right humanity but also the right presence and power to play Miles. We ended up having lunch, and I didn't get a good feel. I didn't think he liked me, and I thought I ruined things right there, but he ended up laughing and chatting. We talked about the movie, and he said he wanted to star in it but also produce it, which I said would be amazing. 

He brought in his producing team, and they were very helpful, brought in a lot of ideas. He suggested Megalyn to me, and you've seen the film; she is just awe-inspiring and a force of nature. They were both collaborative; if I had an idea, they would say, “Okay, let's try this, see if we can make it better, take it to another level.” As a director, that was great. 

HGL: Looking back at the film now, what do you take away from this experience, both personally and professionally?

Jas Summers: Personally, I just take away the fact that I did it, I got it done. That I was able to achieve that meant so much to me in terms of my career, and where I was wondering if it was ever going to happen, and having the determination to figure out a way to never stop, always keep going, there's always a way. 

Then, professionally, I think I just take all the lessons I've learned from people who have already done it. More experience on set, communication, the lessons of professionalism, the lessons of being grateful, being thankful to everyone who was contributing to the project, from crafts to the AD, everyone who played a role in helping me get this film made, and appreciating that and not taking it for granted. 

Stay is now streaming on Hulu and Hulu on Disney+.

Voyager 1 carries the Golden Record, which contains evidence of human life. It is meant to reveal everything about Earth to another civilisation that might exist in the universe. What if they find it after we are long gone?

Voyager 1 has been drifting in space for nearly 50 years. Launched in 1977, it was meant to study the outer planets in the solar system. However, it has outlived its expected lifespan and is now floating in interstellar space, having moved beyond the heliopause in 2012. 

At 25 billion kilometres, it is the most distant man-made object in the universe. It revealed new details about Jupiter and Saturn, and also discovered new moons and rings for both planets. Voyager 1 continues to send back data from deep space and will reach one light day in November 2026 - a point light takes one day to reach from our planet.

Voyager 1 is carrying a ""Golden Record"", filled with messages and images from humans and of other things that exist on Earth. The idea is to let any extraterrestrial life that encounters Voyager to know about Earth and the kind of life and objects that live here. In 1977, it was added to the spacecraft with the assumption that anyone who finds it might want to contact humans.

The record comes with instructions on how to play it and how to locate Earth's position in the universe. But this would only help if Earth were still in its current state, with humans still around. But what if the contact happens after Earth is long gone, or it is still here, but life as we know it today no longer exists?

In the event Voyager 1 and the Golden Record come across alien life after we are no longer here, it becomes a time capsule. With human voices and other sounds, it will be the only surviving proof of life on Earth that once was. 

This would be a scenario similar to Mars, except in this case, another civilisation would also be sure that life once flourished on Earth. With the Red Planet, we are still trying to figure out whether that was the case or not. Several evidence have been discovered that hint that Mars had life once upon a time.

Voyager 1 and the messages in it will become a memorial, a record of Earth's past. The probe would likely remain the only “living” thing still carrying a record of humanity when everyone is gone.

Carl Sagan noted that the ""spacecraft will be encountered and the record played only if there are advanced spacefaring civilisations in interstellar space."" However, the biggest takeaway would be that if Earthlings could launch ""this bottle into the cosmic ocean"", it says ""something very hopeful about life on this planet.""","{'href': 'https://www.wionews.com', 'title': 'WION'}","other"

MONTGOMERY COUNTY (TMX) — Authorities in Pennsylvania say two people are facing charges in an elaborate psychic fraud that prosecutors say swindled victims out of more than $600,000 through false promises to lift curses.

The Montgomery County District Attorney's Office announced that Gina Marie Marks, 52, of Huntingdon Valley, and Steve Nicklas, 40, of Jenkintown, were arrested last week and charged with multiple felonies including corrupt organizations, theft by unlawful taking, theft by deception, dealing in the proceeds of unlawful activities, receiving stolen property and fortune telling.

According to investigators, Marks and Nicklas operated out of “Jenkintown Psychic Visions” at 475 Old York Road, where they allegedly convinced victims they were cursed and needed expensive rituals to remove the spiritual affliction. One victim was allegedly told that failure to pay would destroy her marriage, business, and family. Over 11 months between September 2022 and August 2023, prosecutors say the pair collected nearly $596,000 in cash, jewelry, clothing, concert tickets, and gift cards, promising to “cleanse” the curse. None of the property was ever returned.

A second victim came forward during the investigation, which began in December 2024. The victim reported that Marks allegedly demanded increasingly personal information and photographs, as well as a Chanel purse and more money, threatening “reputational damage and personal repercussions” if the requests weren't met. Authorities estimate she took at least $18,000 from that victim.

Financial records obtained from Cash App, Zelle, and a credit union showed that funds from both victims were transferred into accounts belonging to Marks and Nicklas.

“These defendants, through their con scheme, preyed on people who were looking for help, guidance and hope, exploiting them for financial gain,” said District Attorney Kevin R. Steele. “They are now going to be held accountable for their actions.”

Marks and Nicklas were arrested on Oct. 7 and arraigned before Magisterial District Judge Jodi L. Griffis. Bail was set at 10 percent of $50,000 for Marks and 10 percent of $25,000 for Nicklas. Both posted bail and were released pending a preliminary hearing on Oct. 20 before Judge R. Emmett Madden.

Middle East

The U.S. has done a lot for Arab dictators. For years, Democrats and Republicans have been seeking to give Saudi Arabia, the largest purchaser of American weapons in the world, a NATO-like defense pact. And Washington is drawing closer to Qatar, the Saudi kingdom's nearby frenemy. After pledging to defend Qatar last month, the Trump administration announced a new training facility for Qatari military pilots in Idaho last week.

One of the many favors that the U.S. has given to these governments is helping to drown out dissenting voices, documents given to The Washington Post by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists reveal. Over the past three years, U.S. officials led meetings of Middle Eastern countries to plan ""information operations,"" the documents show, and planned to create a ""Combined Middle East Cyber Center"" and an ""Information Fusion Center"" to systematize these efforts.

The documents were a series of PowerPoint presentations about the ""Regional Security Construct,"" a secret U.S.-led coalition which includes Israel, Qatar, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Kuwait and Oman were listed as ""potential partners"" whose officials were briefed about the coalition meetings.

The Post's coverage focuses on the hypocrisy of the Arab states; while they denounced Israel's war in Gaza, those states were actively working with the Israeli military, including on tunnel warfare training and air defense coordination. However, buried in the reporting is the revelation that those states are receiving direct American help in shaping their propaganda campaigns.

U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) officials were leading meetings on ""information operations to counter Iran's narrative that it is the regional protector of Palestinians and, according to a 2025 document, to 'propagate [a] partner narrative of regional prosperity and cooperation,'"" the Post reports.

And those American officials were working to expand these operations further, advocating for creating an ominously-named ""Information Fusion Center"" to help coalition members ""rapidly plan, execute, and assess operations in the information environment.""

Arab states have put a lot of stock in the internet as a tool of domestic control. Many critics in the Regional Security Construct countries have been reportedly tortured—or even sentenced to death, in the case of Saudi Arabia—simply for posting on social media.

Despite knowing about the repression in Arab states, the U.S. government has been happy to teach them more effective online surveillance tactics.

In 2023, the U.S. State Department reported that Bahrain suffered from ""serious restrictions on internet freedom,"" and that the authorities there considered opposing the monarchy to be a ""terrorist act."" The following year, the State Department trained Bahraini police on how to track ""operations, recruiting, and disinformation"" by ""terrorists"" on social media.

The State Department insisted to Reason at the time that the trainees would be ""vetted for human rights violations in accordance with U.S. law"" and that the U.S. ""consistently raises human rights issues with senior Bahraini officials.""

Publicly, CENTCOM admits to carrying out ""military information support operations,"" including ""countering disinformation,"" as part of ""transregional cooperation to counter state and non-state actors posing a threat to U.S. interests."" It insists that these operations are ""implemented in accordance with U.S. public law and Department of War (DoW) policy guidance.""

But other leaks suggest that U.S. propaganda operations in the Middle East are a lot more sinister than the ""narrative of regional prosperity and cooperation"" described in official documents. In 2022, The Intercept obtained internal documents from Twitter showing that CENTCOM was running fake accounts cheerleading the Saudi war effort in Yemen.

Rather than countering ""disinformation,"" the U.S. military has been caught actively spreading it, including rumors about Iranian doctors stealing organs and Chinese vaccines being made with pork.

It's hard to tell exactly what kind of new information operations CENTCOM has in mind for the Regional Security Construct. The coalition is secretive by design. Documents obtained by the Post promised to keep the cooperation ""in confidence"" and warned that participants ""MUST NOT"" photograph meetings or allow access to journalists.

Worldwide, U.S. military propaganda efforts are a massive undertaking. The Defense Department is asking Congress for a military information support operations budget of over $209 million in FY 2026. It's safe to say that at least some of that money will make it easier for Middle Eastern dictators to control the information space.

By Ladislav Zemánek, non-resident research fellow at China-CEE Institute and expert of the Valdai Discussion Club

By Ladislav Zemánek, non-resident research fellow at China-CEE Institute and expert of the Valdai Discussion Club

When Chinese Premier Li Qiang announced in late September, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, that China would no longer seek new “special and differential treatment” (SDT) in current or future World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations, the statement seemed, at first glance, like a modest policy clarification. Yet beneath the surface, this decision carries profound implications not only for China's global role but also for the future of multilateral trade governance.

To grasp the significance, one must recall what SDT means. Within the WTO framework, developing members have historically been afforded preferential treatment, ranging from lower levels of obligations to longer transition periods for implementation, technical assistance, and specific provisions to safeguard their trade interests. These flexibilities were designed to level the playing field between advanced and developing economies, acknowledging the disparities in capacity and development. For decades, China has been one of the main beneficiaries of these arrangements. Its decision to refrain from seeking further advantages is therefore both symbolically and practically consequential.

China's accession to the WTO in 2001 was the single most consequential trade event of the early 21st century. WTO membership turbocharged Beijing's integration into global markets, granting it privileged access to supply chains, boosting exports, and accelerating domestic reforms toward a more market-oriented economy. This transformation was not confined within China's borders. It reshaped the global economy by expanding the world market, making consumer goods cheaper, lowering inflationary pressures, and creating sophisticated cross-border production networks.

China's rapid ascent – from relative isolation in the late 1970s to becoming the world's second-largest economy and its leading exporter today – was enabled in part by WTO rules that offered protection and flexibility under the umbrella of developing-country status. The economic boom lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens out of poverty, modernized infrastructure, and established China as a central node in the global economy. Yet this same rise also triggered trade tensions, accusations of unfair competition, and debates about the adequacy of the WTO's framework in dealing with a hybrid economy.

It is important to underline that China's refusal to seek new SDT concessions does not mean it renounces its developing-country status. Beijing is adamant that it remains the world's largest developing nation. Despite its aggregate economic size, China's per capita GDP in 2024 stood at $13,303 – a fraction of the $85,809 in the United States and the $43,145 in the European Union. Significant disparities also persist across China's regions, with coastal provinces enjoying higher income levels while inland areas still grapple with underdevelopment.

China also frames itself within the “primary stage of socialism,” a concept dating back to Deng Xiaoping's reforms, which acknowledges that modernization is incomplete. Its technological innovation base, welfare systems, and industrial structure remain uneven compared to advanced economies. This self-identification as a developing country serves as both a political and economic marker, anchoring Beijing's continued alignment with the Global South while deflecting pressure from developed nations that urge it to assume full-fledged “developed country” responsibilities in trade negotiations.

So why, at this juncture, did Beijing choose to forgo additional SDT privileges? The decision is best understood in three layers.

First, it reflects China's ambition to position itself as a leader of post-Western globalization. By declining privileges, Beijing signals confidence in its economic strength and its ability to shape, rather than merely benefit from, global trade rules. It seeks to be recognized as a rule-setter rather than a rule-taker, projecting the image of a responsible stakeholder in the international order.

Second, China aims to cement its role as a defender of the Global South. By voluntarily foregoing new special treatment, Beijing elevates itself above narrow national advantage, presenting its decision as an act of solidarity with developing nations. It aspires to lead the charge for a multipolar and more inclusive international order in which the voices of emerging economies are amplified.

Third, the move is also a diplomatic message to the West. For years, Washington and Brussels have criticized Beijing for allegedly distorting trade through state subsidies, technology transfer requirements, and industrial policy. China's WTO decision offers a conciliatory gesture, signaling that it is willing to compromise and operate within the existing multilateral framework. This comes at a sensitive moment, as the US and China are engaged in negotiations over tariffs and broader trade relations. By playing the role of a cooperative actor, Beijing aims to defuse tensions and demonstrate that confrontation is not inevitable.

The WTO itself is under strain. Rising protectionism, unilateral trade measures, and institutional paralysis have cast doubt on the organization's effectiveness. Against this backdrop, WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala welcomed China's announcement as a positive step toward reform. Beijing's move reinforces its narrative of being a stabilizing force in the global economy, committed to safeguarding multilateralism and resisting fragmentation.

The decision also dovetails with Beijing's broader initiatives, such as the Global Development Initiative (GDI) and the Global Governance Initiative (GGI), launched a month ago. These projects aim to reframe international cooperation in ways that prioritize development, inclusivity, and pragmatic collaboration. China wants its action-oriented approach to become a template, urging others to adopt proactive measures to strengthen multilateral governance structures.

Central to China's narrative is its identity as the world's largest developing country. Beijing insists that this status is not negotiable, even as it forgoes certain privileges. This balancing act allows China to present itself as both a leader and a peer of other developing nations.

The Global South is increasingly assertive, resisting Western dominance and bloc politics while seeking new forms of cooperation. China's model – market socialism with global connectivity – is gaining attention as an alternative path to modernization. Concrete actions back this up. Since December 2024, China has granted zero-tariff treatment on 100% of product lines to all least developed countries with which it has diplomatic ties, currently numbering 44. In June 2025, it extended this policy to 53 African nations. These initiatives demonstrate that Beijing's rhetoric about solidarity is underpinned by tangible economic incentives.

Through frameworks such as the Belt and Road Initiative and various South-South cooperation platforms within the UN system, China positions itself as a patron of modernization, sovereignty, and independent development for countries often marginalized in Western-led globalization. By enhancing access to its vast market, offering infrastructure investments, and promoting tariff-free trade, Beijing builds long-term partnerships that reinforce its political clout and soft power.

What makes China's WTO stance particularly noteworthy is the dual role it seeks to play. On one hand, it champions reform, calling for changes to global trade governance that reflect multipolar realities and the developmental rights of poorer countries. On the other hand, it remains firmly invested in the status quo, recognizing the WTO as essential to keeping markets open and constraining unilateralism.

This duality allows China to act simultaneously as a reformist and a conservative force: preserving a multilateral order that legitimizes its rise while reshaping it to dilute Western dominance. By aligning itself with the WTO, Beijing underscores that it does not intend to dismantle global institutions but rather to recalibrate them in ways that reflect its vision of a more inclusive and balanced order.

China's announcement that it will no longer seek new SDT provisions is far more than a technical trade policy shift. It encapsulates the evolution of China's global role – from a developing-country beneficiary of globalization to a self-styled leader of reform and defender of multilateralism. The decision reflects confidence in its own development, ambition to lead the Global South, and desire to be recognized as a responsible power willing to compromise.

Yet it also highlights the balancing act Beijing must perform: insisting on its developing-country identity while simultaneously wielding power as a near-peer of advanced economies. For the WTO, this move injects momentum into reform debates and offers a rare positive signal amid widespread skepticism about the future of multilateralism. For the Global South, it reinforces China's image as a patron and advocate. For the West, it offers both a challenge and an opportunity: to engage with a China that is less demanding of privileges but no less assertive in shaping the rules of the game.

China's latest move is not the end of the story but the beginning of a new chapter in global trade politics — one in which the lines between development and leadership, compromise and ambition, reform and continuity, are increasingly blurred.

Lindsey Graham says closure won't push him to meet Democrats' demands on Obama-era healthcare subsidies

Republican and Democratic senators Lindsey Graham and Mark Kelly have dug their heels in over the government shutdown – which is now approaching two weeks, with the former saying that the closure won't push him to meet Democrats' demands for a restoration of Obama-era healthcare subsidies.

Graham said on NBC News's Meet the Press on Sunday that he was in favor of the Senate voting to reopen the government and prepared to “have a rational discussion” with Democrats – but not with the government shut down.

“I'm willing to vote to open the government up tomorrow,” Graham said. “To my Democratic friends: I am not going to vote to extend these subsidies.”

Graham, speaking to Democrats, added: “It's up to you. If you want to keep it shut down, fine. It's not going to change how I approach healthcare.”

The senator's comments came as Vice-President JD Vance warned that permanent cuts to the federal workforce will only get “deeper” as the shutdown continues.

Vance told Fox News's Maria Bartiromo on Sunday Morning Futures that “the longer it goes on, Maria, the more significant they're going to be. If you remember, we went nine days before announcing any significant layoffs.

“The longer this goes on, the deeper the cuts are going to be,” Vance continued.

More than 4,000 federal workers have so far been identified for job terminations. The Senate has voted multiple times over the last two weeks on a stopgap funding measure but not enough Democrats have joined the proposal to reach a 60-vote threshold.

Graham's comments may indicate a hardening approach to negotiations over healthcare subsidies with or without a functioning government.

“The subsidies we're talking about here,” Graham told NBC. “If the (Obama's) Affordable Care Act is so affordable, why, every time I turn around, are we spending $350 billion to keep it afloat?”

The dispute on the network continued with Arizona senator Mark Kelly, a Democrat, criticizing Republicans for refusing to negotiate with Democrats.

“We need a real negotiation, and we need a fix. We need this corrected for the American people. This is for so many people – their healthcare is running towards a cliff, and if we don't fix this, it's going to go right over it,” Kelly told host Kristen Welker on Meet the Press.

Against increasing pressure to reach a deal, with both sides weighing the political cost of a lack of a resolution, House speaker Mike Johnson said on Monday that Republicans had “probably a hundred different ideas about how to fix it but we can't do that overnight”.

He said Democrats' demands for a resolution to the healthcare subsidies issue without lengthy discussions were “impossible and inappropriate”.

“It's not a deliverable and they know it,” Johnson said. “They chose that issue because they thought it would sell well to the public and it would show they were fighting Trump. It's all a big facade and I'm so frustrated by it.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","Dozens rescued, over 1,000 people displaced and hunt for missing ongoing following monster storm in western Alaska","https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/13/weather/alaska-storm-flooding-typhoon-halong-climate","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 15:29:07 GMT","


            Rescuers in western Alaska are working to find missing residents and help the over 1,000 people displaced after ferocious, hurricane-force wind gusts from what once was Typhoon Halong tore through remote, coastal communities, unleashed record-breaking storm surge and shoved homes completely off their foundations.
    


            Three people are still unaccounted for in Kwigillingok as of Monday, said officials, who made clear they are still being considered missing and not dead at this point in the search. At least 51 people and two dogs have been rescued in Kipnuk and Kwigillingok since the weekend, and over 1,000 others have been displaced and are currently in shelters, a local tribal health agency said. Authorities said they were working to confirm reports of additional missing individuals in Kipnuk.
    


            The sparsely populated villages are more than 400 miles southwest of Anchorage. “Both communities experienced strong winds and heavy flooding overnight, which caused significant damage, including at least eight homes being pushed from their foundations,” Alaska State Troopers said Sunday, although officials said Monday afternoon that they are not sure how many buildings or homes are impacted overall. 



            Search efforts continued overnight and throughout Monday involved help from the Alaska Air National Guard, Alaska Army National Guard and the US Coast Guard, according to the state troopers and the state's Department of Public Safety. The Alaska National Guard response includes about 60 to 80 soldiers on the ground as of Monday, and upwards of 200 soldiers near the end of the week, said Maj. Gen. Torrence Saxe, who runs the state's National Guard. It is the “largest [response] I've seen in quite some time,” he said.
    


            Some search and rescue efforts involved helicopters rescuing people off the roofs of houses as they were surrounded by several feet of flooding, images that are reminiscent to rescues conducted during Hurricane Katrina, said US Coast Guard Capt. Christopher Culpepper.
    


            “If you imagine the worst case scenario, that's what we are dealing with,” he said. 



            The storm generated wind gusts 100 mph or more in western Alaska Sunday, akin to the gusts Category 1 or 2 hurricanes are capable of. Wind gusts hit 107 mph in Kusilvak while nearby Toksook Bay recorded a gust of 100 mph, according to the National Weather Service.
    


            These winds also drove dangerous storm surge, pushing feet of water onto land, which triggered major flooding in coastal areas. Water levels in Kipnuk soared to 14.5 feet Sunday — more than 2 feet above major flood stage and 1.5 feet above the previous record flood level set in 2000.
    


            The storm was once Typhoon Halong, a powerful tropical system that formed in the northern Philippine Sea earlier this month, skirted by Japan without making landfall and then crossed the north Pacific Ocean. It was no longer tropical by the time it entered the Bering Sea this weekend, but that did not eliminate its power.
    


            The storm moved through northern Alaska late Sunday and pushed into the Arctic Sea early Monday, leaving communities to pick up the pieces in its wake.
    


            “Every effort will be made to help those hit by this storm. Help is on the way,” Gov. Mike Dunleavy said in a statement Sunday announcing the expansion of a state disaster declaration to include the areas impacted by the weekend storm. He emphasized Monday there will be support for residents in the short term as well as for long-term needs.
    


            The initial declaration, issued on Thursday, addressed damage in western Alaska caused by another powerful coastal storm earlier in the week that brought extensive flooding.
    


            Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska said he has “been in frequent conversations with Acting FEMA Director David Richardson, and also in contact with local, tribal and state officials, including the Governor, and with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.”
    


            “FEMA is in direct contact with state and local officials and has an incident management team traveling to Alaska as we speak with a FEMA search-and-rescue group pre-positioned in Washington on standby. According to FEMA, the government shutdown is not impacting the agency's response to this emergency,” Sullivan said in a statement.

The broadcaster's news channel, TVP Info, reported that “there was foreign interference with the satellite links through which the Lithuania–Poland match was being broadcast,” citing information from satellite operator Eutelsat. Officials said the incident was under investigation as efforts continued to identify those responsible for the attack.

The match was held in Kaunas, southern Lithuania, where around 5,000 Polish fans were in attendance. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk also watched the game from the stands.

Poland ultimately defeated Lithuania 2–0 in the Group G World Cup qualifier, strengthening their hold on second place behind the Netherlands.

The US Department of Defense is scrambling to stock up on approximately $1 billion worth of rare earth minerals due to China's new export controls covering materials that have a military use, Financial Times has reported.

According to the US Geological Survey, China accounts for nearly 70% of the global production of critical minerals, which play a key role in the manufacturing of most modern technologies and weapons systems.

In an article on Sunday, the outlet, citing public filings by the US Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), reported that Washington had considerably accelerated its efforts to stockpile rare earths in recent months. The publication quoted an anonymous former defense official as saying that the US is “definitely looking for more, and they're doing it in a deliberate and expansive way, and looking for new sources of different ores needed for defense products.”

According to the British newspaper, some of the materials the Pentagon is now seeking to purchase were previously absent from its wishlist.

Financial Times reported that the US military is looking to buy up to $500 million worth of cobalt, up to $245 million of antimony, up to $100 million of tantalum, and up to $45 million of scandium, among other materials.

”Market participants have been taken aback by the volumes requested by the DLA,” Cristina Belda from Argus Media consultancy firm told FT, adding that “many consider the quantities to be unrealistic, especially within the proposed five-year timeframe.”

Last Thursday, China announced new export controls on certain strategic minerals that have dual-use in military applications, citing national security considerations. Under the new rules, foreign companies are to obtain special approval before exporting goods containing even minimal amounts of Chinese-sourced rare earth elements.

In a post on his Truth Social platform on Friday, US President Donald Trump wrote that Washington would “impose a Tariff of 100% on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying,” starting November 1. He said it was in retaliation for Beijing's “extraordinarily aggressive” export restrictions.

Two members of Israel's Knesset were removed from the chamber after holding up pro-Palestinian signs during US President Donald Trump's speech on Monday.

Ayman Odeh and Ofer Cassif, from the mainly Arab Hadash-Ta'al coalition, held signs reading “Recognize Palestine!” –prompting immediate uproar from other legislators.

Trump paused and stood silent as the MPs were quickly escorted out. He then remarked, “That was very efficient,” before continuing his speech.

Cassif defended his actions on X, writing that Trump was “part of the problem, not a solution,” and that “true peace requires an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.”

Odeh also defended his stunt, writing, “They kicked me out of the Knesset just for raising the simplest demand, one that the whole international community agrees on: Recognize the State of Palestine!”

The US president visited Israel to oversee the implementation of an agreement he helped mediate, under which Hamas freed the remaining 20 living hostages in exchange for the release of around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed Trump as the “greatest friend” Israel has ever had.

Later that day, Trump signed the Gaza ceasefire deal with mediators from Egypt, Qatar, and Türkiye in Sharm el-Sheikh, on Egypt's Sinai Peninsula.

Germany's new foreign intelligence chief has described Russia as a direct threat to the EU, warning its “icy peace” with the bloc could escalate into “heated confrontation” at any moment.

Martin Jager, who took over Germany's Federal Intelligence Service (BND) last month, told lawmakers in Berlin on Monday that Moscow seeks to destabilize European democracies and undermine NATO – allegations the Kremlin has consistently denied.“We must not sit back and assume that a possible Russian attack will not come until 2029 at the earliest,” Jager said, speaking alongside the heads of Germany's domestic and military intelligence agencies. “At best, there is an icy peace in Europe, which could turn into heated confrontation at any moment.” “To achieve this goal, Russia will not shy away from direct military confrontation with NATO, if necessary,” he argued.

Berlin has frequently raised the prospect of a direct clash between NATO and Moscow since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. Germany's chief of defense staff, General Carsten Breuer, has said the country must be ready to face Russia by 2029.

Jager's remarks come as Western European governments are boosting military spending, citing an alleged Russian threat. At a NATO summit in The Hague in June, member nations committed to increasing defense expenditure targets from 2% to 5% of GDP by 2035. The EU, in turn, similarly approved several programs aimed at boosting military spending this year, including the €800 billion ($930 billion) ReArm Europe initiative.

Moscow has rejected accusations that it plans to attack NATO or any EU member, calling them a pretext to justify soaring military budgets at the expense of social programs.

Speaking at the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi this month, President Vladimir Putin accused Western Europe of continuing to “whip up hysteria that war with the Russians is supposedly on the doorstep” and dismissed such concerns as a “nonsense mantra,” suggesting that European leaders shift their focus to domestic issues.

His aide Yury Ushakov said European leaders appear to be united in a collective anti-Russian frenzy, leaving no room for dialogue.

MOSCOW, October 13. /TASS/. In breach of the international law, the Kiev government is using terrorist methods against civilians in Russia, but all terrorists and war criminals will face an inevitable punishment, said Natalya Nikonorova, a member of the Russian Federation Council (upper house of parliament) Committee on Foreign Affairs.

On Monday, it became known that operatives from the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) have foiled a terrorist attack in Moscow against a high-ranking officer from Russia's Defense Ministry, which was plotted by Ukrainian special services jointly with the Islamic State terrorist group (outlawed in Russia). Commenting on the report, Nikonorova, who is also a former foreign minister of the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) has told TASS: ""This is not the first case that confirms the inhumane and terrorist nature of the Kiev regime.""

""Using radical suicide bombers, committing attacks with generally dangerous methods aimed at inflicting as much suffering as possible, cynical recognition of the past and future crimes - this is what terrorists normally do. Russian troops are fighting on the battlefield, while Kiev's death squads are covertly and dastardly try to wage some sort of ‘warfare' way behind the frontline, choosing civilians as their target,"" she said.

In her words, such actions violate the universally recognized norms of the international law.

""Every war criminal, every terrorist will be imminently brought to justice,"" she said.

On October 13, the FSB said it had prevented a sabotage and terror attack against one of the high-ranking officers of Russia's Defense Ministry. The attack was supposed to be carried out in one of the Russian capital's densely populated areas. The detainee said that he had planted it in a bicycle near the building's entrance. According to specialists, the yield of the explosive device would have ensured a lethal radius of up to 70 meters. Following the prevented terrorist attack, the FSB's Investigative Directorate has opened a criminal case on plotting a terror attack and the illegal use of explosive materials or devices.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Universities, law firms and businesses that have changed course should have stood by convictions, says ex-president

Barack Obama took aim at institutions and businesses who made deals or worked out settlements with the Trump administration, noting on a new podcast episode: “We all have this capacity, I think, to take a stand.”

In a talk with Marc Maron on the comedian's last edition of his long-running WTF With Marc Maron, the former US president said institutions – including law firms, universities and businesses – that have changed course during the Trump administration should have stood by their convictions.

Instead of bending to the administration, Obama noted that universities should say: “This will hurt if we lose some grant money in the federal government, but that's what endowments are for. Let's see if we can ride this out, because what we're not going to do is compromise our basic academic independence.”

He also noted that the organizations that did concede to Trump should be able to say: “We're not going to be bullied into saying that we can only hire people or promote people based on some criteria that's been cooked up by Steve Miller,” in reference to the top White House aide and architect of Trump's hardline immigration policy.

Obama, whose two terms preceded the first Trump administration, also said that companies should also have stood up against administration pressure campaign to turn back from diversity hiring.

“We think it's important, because of what this country is, to hire people from different backgrounds,” Obama said.

Universities, law firms and other businesses have all reached agreements with the White House, including dropping DEI targets and agreeing to rein in campus antisemitism in exchange for restoration of federal funding. A series of powerful Washington law firms have also agreed to provide free legal services to the administration, while corporations have rolled back diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.

Disney, a frequent target of political-ideological factions on the left and right, scrapped its internal “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion” program for “Opportunity & Inclusion” to empower “all through access, opportunity, and a culture of belonging”.

Elsewhere in the interview, Obama acknowledged that integrity comes at a price.

“Sometimes it's going to be uncomfortable,” he told Maron, referencing a joke that Maron made in his stand-up routine that Democrats annoyed the average American into fascism.

“It cracked me up,” Obama said. “I wasn't as funny about saying this, but four or five years ago I said: ‘Look, you can't just be a scold all the time. You can't constantly lecture people without acknowledging you've got some blind spots, too.'”

Vulnerability, he said, comes in standing up for core convictions but not attempting to assert “that I am so righteous, and so pure, and so insightful, that there isn't the possibility I'm wrong on this.

“There was this weird progressive language,” he said, that implied a “holier than thou superiority that's not different to what we used to joke about coming from the right and the moral majority … and certain fundamentalism that I think was dangerous”.

Maron posted the final episode of his show on Monday after 16 years of hosting and with more than 1,600 installments that he's broadcast from his Los Angeles garage. Obama brought the 62-year-old host, stand-up comic and actor to his Washington office for the last interview.

Obama asked the initial questions. “How are you feeling about this whole thing?” he said, “transition, moving on from this thing that has been one of the defining parts of your career and your life?”

“I feel OK,” Maron answered. “I feel like I'm sort of ready for the break, but there is sort of a fear there, of what do I do now? I'm busy. But, not unlike your job … I've got a lot of people who over the last 16 years have grown to rely on me.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Blazing debris on road amid rain and wind, with one person on ground hurt and no known survivors found on plane

A small plane crashed along a major highway in south-eastern Massachusetts early on Monday amid rain and strong winds, killing both people on board and wounding another person on the ground, authorities said.

In videos taken by people in passing vehicles, smoke could be seen billowing up above Interstate 195 from scattered, blazing debris. The highway was closed in both directions near the crash site in Dartmouth, a town about 50 miles (80km) miles south of Boston, the state department of transportation said.

The Massachusetts state police said in a statement it was not aware of any survivors on the plane, which it said may have been attempting to land at New Bedford regional airport. However, officials said it does not appear that the pilot provided the airport with a flight plan or passenger details.

A spokesperson for the National Transportation Safety Board said it was investigating the crash, saying a Socata TBM-700 had departed from the New Bedford airport.

No information about the people on board would be made public, authorities said, pending notification of their next of kin.

A person on the ground was also taken to the hospital, state police said.

At the time of the crash, the National Weather Service said a nor'easter had brought rain and winds from 30 to 40mph (48 to 64kph) to the area.

The Federal Aviation Administration, which state police said would likely take over the investigation, said in an email that it could not respond to media inquiries due to the government shutdown.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The US Senate on Thursday last week passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2026, which strongly encourages the US secretary of defense to invite Taiwan's naval forces to participate in the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise, as well as allocating military aid of US$1 billion for Taiwan.

The bill, which authorizes appropriations for the military activities of the US Department of Defense, military construction and other purposes, passed with 77 votes in support and 20 against.

While the NDAA authorizes about US$925 billion of defense spending, the Central News Agency yesterday reported that an aide of US Senator Jacky Rosen told it that the bill includes US$1 billion military aid for Taiwan under the Taiwan Security Cooperation Initiative.

The act also strongly encourages the US secretary of defense to invite the naval forces of Taiwan to participate, as appropriate, in any RIMPAC exercise, and that if the defense secretary decides not to invite Taiwan's naval forces, they should submit to the congressional defense committees a written justification for such a decision no later than 30 days after the decision is made.

RIMPAC is the world's largest multinational maritime exercise, conducted biennially in Hawaii, hosted by the US and bringing together nearly 30 partner nations to strengthen collective forces, and promote a free and open Indo-Pacific region.

The bill includes a provision instructing the US secretary of defense, in coordination with the US secretary of state, to seek to engage with Taiwanese officials in a joint program for the purpose of enabling the fielding of uncrewed systems and counteruncrewed systems capabilities.

Another provision calls for analysis on the critical digital infrastructure of Taiwan, in the event of a military invasion or blockade by China, and for identifying potential actions by the Pentagon to protect such infrastructure.

The bill also authorizes the US secretary of defense to assign a Defense Priorities and Allocations System order rating, prioritizing the order of foreign military sales, including to Taiwan, Israel, Japan, South Korea and the Philippines, as well as NATO members, major defense partners and other eligible purchasers.

The bill calls for establishing a partnership between the Pentagon's Defense Innovation Unit and its counterpart in Taiwan to enhancing market opportunities for defense technology companies based in the US or Taiwan, bolster Taiwan's defense industrial base, and counter the Chinese Communist Party and its proxy groups' dual-use defense technology development.

It also sets a limit on the travel expenses to be used by the office of the US secretary of defense until it submits a “Taiwan Security Assistance Road Map” — a multiyear plan to fulfill the defensive requirements of Taiwan's military forces, and submits a report on the Pentagon's activities necessary for supporting the potential establishment of a regional contingency stockpile for Taiwan.

Meanwhile, in a statement issued on Thursday last week, US Senator Dave McCormick said that the NDAA includes the Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act, which requires the US governor of the IMF to use the US vote to support the admission of Taiwan as a member of the IMF.

The US House of Representatives last month approved its own version of the NDAA, and the House and Senate Armed Services Committees are to negotiate a compromise bill before sending it to US President Donald Trump to sign or veto.

The requirement was set out in a draft amendment to the Enforcement Rules of the Public Officials Election and Recall Act (公職人員選舉罷免法 ) released by the ministry on Thursday.
Under the proposal, candidates would need to make the declaration when submitting their registration forms, which would be published in the official election bulletin.
The move follows the removal of several elected officials who were

The Taiwan Taiko Association opened the celebrations with a 100-drummer performance, including young percussionists.

As per tradition, an air force Mirage 2000 fighter jet flew over the Presidential Office as a part of the performance.

The Honor Guards of the ROC and its marching band also heralded in a military parade.

FOUR DESIGNATED AREAS:
                                        Notices were issued for live-fire exercises in waters south and northwest of Penghu, northeast of Keelung and west of Kaohsiung, they said                                        The military is planning three major annual exercises across the army, navy and air force this month, with the navy's “Hai Chiang” (海強, “Sea Strong”) drills running from today through Thursday, the Ministry of National Defense said yesterday.
The Hai Chiang exercise, which is to take place in waters surrounding Taiwan, would feature P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft and S-70C anti-submarine helicopters, the ministry said, adding that the drills aim to bolster the nation's offshore defensive capabilities.
China has intensified military and psychological pressure against Taiwan, repeatedly sending warplanes and vessels into areas near the nation's air defense identification zone and across                                    


COVETED PRIZE:
                                         The US president would be a peace prize laureate should he persuade Xi Jinping to abandon military aggression against Taiwan, William Lai said                                        US President Donald Trump should get the Nobel Peace Prize should he be able to convince Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) to abandon the use of force against Taiwan, President William Lai (賴清德) told a conservative US radio show and podcast in an interview.
The US is Taiwan's most important international backer, despite the absence of formal ties, but since Trump took office earlier this year he has not announced any new arms sales to the nation.
Trump could meet Xi at the APEC summit in South Korea on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1.

Minister of National Defense Wellington Ku (顧立雄) yesterday said that it would be “challenging” for the builder of the Hai Kun (海鯤) submarine to deliver the ship to the navy next month, as equipment tests and calibration take time.

Ku spoke of progress in readying Taiwan's first indigenous submarine before attending a briefing at the legislature's Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee. 

“I am confident that the submarine would eventually be completed, but the testing and calibration would take time, and it would be extremely challenging to complete them for delivery to the navy next month,” Ku said.

The submarine project's progress was supported by legislators across party lines after the confidential briefing, the navy said in a statement at noon yesterday.

Legislators urged verifying the safety and quality of the submarine before proceeding to sea trials, a navy spokesperson added.

Testing the prototype submarine is being conducted in three phases: surface navigation tests, shallow-water diving tests and deep-water diving tests, the navy said, adding that the submarine entered the surface navigation testing phase on June 17.

So far, three surface navigation tests had been conducted to verify integrated functions of various systems, including propulsion, navigation instruments, communications systems, ship control and periscopes, the navy said. 

The submarine was evaluated at CSBC Corp's dry dock from July 8 to Sept. 2 in three major areas: hull watertightness inspection, equipment calibration, and inspection and maintenance of combat systems, the navy said.

For sea trials, preparations have been completed for the combat and sonar systems, as well as main hydraulics and submarine ballast systems, the navy said.

However, two system groups — the main engine and power management system, and the integrated platform management system (IPMS) — still require testing before the submarine meets the necessary preconditions for diving tests. 

Testing of the main engine and power management system takes more time, as it involves multiple contractors and requires coordination to arrange the testing schedule, the navy said, dismissing claims that it had encountered technical issues. 

The testing is critical, as it would verify the main engine's seaworthiness to ensure the vessel's stability and functionality underway, it said.

Meanwhile, IPMS is a highly automated and integrated system capable of remotely operating and monitoring equipment aboard, the navy said, adding that the hardware of the system has undergone testing, with software modifications and validations ongoing.

CSBC has dispatched additional software engineers to work alongside the original manufacturer to accelerate completion, the navy said.

The testing results of the two systems would be jointly evaluated by the project team, foreign consultants, and the navy officers operating the submarine, the navy said, adding that only after meeting the necessary conditions for safe diving would sea trials be scheduled.

Shallow-water diving tests primarily verify functions related to ship handling, intelligence-gathering equipment, emergency systems and combat management, while deep-water diving tests add functional verification of the vessel's performance capabilities.

According to the post, the flight attendant complained of feeling sick on board a flight, but was unable to take sick leave or access medical care.

Russia is ready to test European borders and escalate the current tensions into an open confrontation at any moment, German intelligence head Martin Jaeger told German lawmakers on Oct. 13.

""We can't simply wait and assume that a potential Russian attack won't come before 2029,"" Jaeger said. ""We're already under fire today.""

The comments echo warnings by Western officials about Moscow's escalating hybrid operations across Europe, including drone incursions, sabotage, and cyberattacks.

While NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte warned that Russia will be ready for an open military clash with the alliance in five years, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz noted that the ongoing hybrid campaign means Europe is already no longer at peace.

""Russia is concealing its true intentions, but in fact it's probing our borders,"" Jaeger told the Bundestag. ""At best, Europe is in a state of cold peace — one that could flare into a hot confrontation at any moment.""

The head of Germany's Federal Intelligence Service (BND), who previously served as an ambassador to Kyiv, warned that Russia will interpret restraint as weakness, adding, ""We must confront our adversaries wherever necessary.""

Friction between NATO and Moscow has intensified since the allies rallied behind Kyiv after Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Recent weeks saw the tensions surge further after Russian drones and aircraft repeatedly violated allied airspace. Suspicious drone sightings also caused disruptions to air traffic in Germany, Denmark, and Norway.

In early September, Polish and allied forces shot down several Russian drones over Poland's territory, marking the first such instance since the outbreak of Moscow's full-scale invasion.

The incursions prompted calls for strengthening allied defenses, while some NATO members urged downing Russian aircraft if necessary.

The American Revolution hero Marquis de Lafayette of France made history in 1824 as the first foreigner to speak to the United States Congress. John F. Kennedy made history when he told members of Parliament in Ottawa in 1961 that “geography has made us neighbours. History has made us friends.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made history when he spoke in recent years to seven foreign legislative bodies in person and to three dozen others online.

But few, if any, speeches to a foreign legislature have had the weight of history that was carried by Donald Trump's appearance at the Knesset Monday. 

There he spoke to what he called “the cherished citizens of Israel,” was treated to a “Trump, Trump, Trump” chant that echoed through the parliamentary complex in the government compound in Givat Ram section of Jerusalem, and spoke of “the beginning of an age of faith and hope and of God.”

Winston Churchill's three speeches to the American Congress were exhortations to victory in the Second World War and the Cold War. Mr. Trump's address in Jerusalem after the tearful return of the Israeli hostages was instead a message about a nascent settlement, saying, “the sun rises on a Holy Land that is finally at peace.” 

Not since Woodrow Wilson's 1918 triumphal tour of devastated Europe at the conclusion of the First World War and Mr. Kennedy's 1963 “Ich bin ein Berliner” speech at Rathaus Schöneberg has an American president been greeted with such enthusiasm, even worship, overseas. 

U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday declared a 'historic dawn of a new Middle East' in a speech to lawmakers in the Israeli parliament.

The Associated Press

Mr. Trump, increasingly drawn to religious imagery, offered “Our deepest thanks to the almighty God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob” and said, “The enemies of all civilization are in retreat.”

His remarks were preceded by a combative introduction, laced with allusions to Biblical heroes, that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu employed to call Mr. Trump “the greatest friend the State of Israel has ever had in the White House.”

Mr. Netanyahu repeatedly issued variations that phrase and saluted him for having “brought America back again.” He nominated Mr. Trump to be the first foreigner to be granted the Israel Prize, the country's highest civilian award.

In turn, Mr. Trump, in an extraordinary and apparently extemporaneous venture into Israeli domestic politics, called for a pardon of Mr. Netanyahu, who is charged with breach of trust, bribery and fraud. He denies the charges. 

Israel celebrates release of remaining hostages as Trump declares ‘dawn of new Middle East'

This emotional moment came as a dramatic capstone to what Mr. Trump called “two harrowing years of darkness” that descended on “this sacred soil” but that appears to have ended with an American-brokered tentative and fragile but promising accord. 

It brought a conclusion to fighting in the Middle East – the “spiritual and geographical centre of the entire world,” Mr. Trump said – that began with the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack. The regional crisis accelerated with Israel's military response, which left Gaza in ruins, strained relations between Israel and its American patrons, undermined the Jewish state's moral authority in the world and prompted a global surge in antisemitism. 

Despite a brief interruption of protest in the Knesset chamber, Israel displayed to Mr. Trump a sense of national unity that the 47th president – the most divisive American leader in modern times – cannot replicate at home but earned in Israel. 

It came through the release of the country's hostages and the Palestinian prisoners that Mr. Trump helped win, some 9,500 kilometres from the continuing domestic political combat in Washington. One lawmaker in the President's audience wore a bright red “Make America Great Again” baseball cap.

An angry political combatant suddenly transformed into a happy warrior for peace, Mr. Trump seemed to luxuriate in defying his critics (many of whom consider him a trigger-prone aggressive adventurer, lately provoking maritime confrontations off Venezuela) and his reputation (for preferring conflict over conciliation and for making “fight, fight fight!” his slogan). 

Mr. Trump's brief visit to the Middle East was more than a celebratory victory tour. It was another chance for Mr. Trump to issue familiar gibes against Barack Obama and Joe Biden – this time as unfaithful to Israel's interests. 

But it also was a rare instance of subtlety from Mr. Trump. 

The President's remarks were shaped to change the global narrative of the two-year Gaza war. His speech was an effort to focus global attention on the Hamas attack rather than on Israel's response and the civilian toll it brought.

World leaders gathering in Egypt throw their weight behind deal to end war in Gaza

“Let us remember,” Mr. Trump said, “how this nightmare of depravity and death all began.”

In Jerusalem, and later at a signing ceremony at the Red Sea resort Sharm el-Sheikh, where days earlier the cease-fire took form, the President – already celebrated for acknowledging Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, recognizing contested regions as Israeli territory, forging the 2020 Abraham Accords, and unleashing American firepower against Iran's nuclear facilities – called for peace rather than issuing a call to arms. 

Mr. Trump, not prone to understatement, said of Mr. Netanyahu, “He's not the easiest guy to deal with,” and then added, to the applause of the Knesset, “but that's what makes him great.” He also saluted Arab leaders who leaned on Hamas to grab this chance for peace.

The settlement was a result in part of pressure on Hamas from Egypt and Qatar, who warned the group that this proposed accord was its last opportunity to end the carnage in Gaza. Turkey chimed in, too. 

At risk for Hamas was the safe harbour Turkey gave its leadership, which increasingly was isolated diplomatically as well as geographically. The benefit was humanitarian aid and the prospect of reconstruction and rehabilitation of Gaza. 

The pact brought concessions, but it also reflected the fragility of the Hamas position, the prospect of a conflict without end, and the desperation of the Palestinian people Hamas was committed to serve. 

Mr. Trump – who spoke of a “covenant between our two promised lands” and made reference to the “hope of Zion” – said in triumph, “Peace is not just a hope we can dream about but a reality we can build on.” He urged Iran to seek a peace agreement as well. And he reminded leaders around the world, “I make deals. I'm good at it.”

The S&P/TSX Composite Index is up more than 26 per cent year-over-year.Tijana Martin/The Canadian Press

John Rapley is a contributing columnist for The Globe and Mail. He is an author and academic whose books include Why Empires Fall and Twilight of the Money Gods.

Is it 1999 all over again in the markets?

The economy may be in recession, but if you're invested in stocks, things have seldom been better. American markets dipped on Friday with the escalating trade war between the United States and China. But on Monday they parred back most losses as rhetoric cooled. The S&P 500 Index is still up more than 13 per cent year over year.

In Canada it's even better. With the S&P/TSX Composite Index up more than 20 per cent year-over-year, a twenty-something living at home and socking money into shares can look forward to retiring at 40. Housing bubble? That's so 2020.

And the prospects for 2026 are more of the same. Analysts are now predicting that the S&P500 could hit 9,000 next year. Helping to drive the rally is the increasing popularity of passive investment funds, which just follow the market and so reinforce existing momentum. And with the U.S. market actually underperforming the rest of the world, returns elsewhere will probably be even better.

That's because the world is awash with money, its biggest economies flooded with cash by free-spending governments and laid-back central banks. Government debt is surging in the U.S. and China as governments there try to boost their economies. The election of a new prime minister in Japan has further raised the prospects of stimulus in that country, thus encouraging investors and banks to loosen their purse strings. 

Opinion: The markets will burn as Trump fiddles with the Fed

Equally, there's a growing expectation among investors that France's political crisis will cause the European Central Bank to once again do “whatever it takes” to rescue the euro, printing money in order to keep French bonds from collapsing. Across Europe, populist parties snap at the heels of governments and promise lavish spending if they take office. That's making it hard for governments to rein in spending and causing some to open the taps, especially in Germany.

Despite this, monetary policy almost everywhere in the developing world remains fairly easy. Rather than raise interest rates to keep inflation low, most central banks are holding pat or even cutting, anxious not to slow economic growth. 

Therein lies the paradox: Markets are soaring but aren't dragging economies along with them, and central bankers are caught in the middle. With central banks thus unwilling to defend the value of their currencies, investment banks are starting to advise clients to go all in on the “debasement trade”: buying assets, any assets, fast before the value of money declines.

This market mania is causing ever more analysts to draw parallels with 1999, the final year of the dot-com bubble, when the Nasdaq rose nearly 50 per cent before finally crashing. With AI stocks dragging markets to all-time highs, we may be in the early stages of the final melt-up before the mother of all crashes.

There are vital differences between today and 1999. The rally may be more sustainable: AI companies are actually making things, such as chips and data centres, whereas many of the dot-com companies were little more than promises. 

However, the fallout from a crash, if it happens, could be worse. That's because in 1999 the governments of the big economies carried far less debt. The U.S. national debt was less than half what it is today, and its budget was in surplus, leaving the government with ample resources to fight a recession. This time around, public finances are so stretched that any further spending increases will drive interest rates up.

In 1999, meanwhile, everyone joined the party. The economy was booming, and everyone was spending. I happened to be living in Washington at the peak of the boom, and the bars, restaurants and malls were packed. 

This time around, half the spending is being done by the top 10 per cent of earners, leaving the majority feeling worse off because of inflation, slowing wage growth and a sluggish job market. 

Unhappiness over this state of affairs is particularly strong among young people. The suicide rate in the U.S. has risen more than 50 per cent between 1999 and today, driven by higher youth rates. Here in Canada, research has also tracked a sharp drop in happiness among young people, driven largely by the high cost of living. 

One manifestation of this discontent among the young has been a rising support for more radical political movements and parties, of both the left and the right. Across the developed world, right- and left-wing populists are squeezing out the political centre. 

So whereas the 2000 U.S. election was a civilized affair conducted over how to spend the emerging massive government surplus – whether to spend it on Social Security or tax cuts – future elections will likely be fought over defining the enemy. 

The stock market party thus hides an underlying reality: This boom may be on borrowed time, and the bill keeps rising. When it comes due, the reckoning over who should pay it could be harsher than in the past. No wonder the price of gold keeps rising by the day.

Donald Trump signs Gaza peace document, alongside key mediators Egypt, Qatar and Turkey. The ceremony in Egypt followed the release of all living Israeli hostages held by Hamas.

Below is a roundup of the main developments in Israel, Gaza and the Middle East on Monday, October 13:



Sarah Yerkes of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace tells DW that hopes that US President Donald Trump's plan would bring peace to the Middle East are premature.

""I think this is just one ... very important first step,"" the Middle East and US foreign policy analyst says, adding that many of the details still need to be ""hammered out.""

According to Yerkes, the fact that neither Israel nor Hamas joined the summit is an issue.

""There's so many details, including whether or not Hamas will agree to disarm, which is one of the crucial pieces of this that have yet to be decided,"" she said.

Yerkes added that she believed that Netanyahu would go ahead with plans to annex ""large portions"" of the occupied West Bank.

""For Netanyahu, what he cares about is the West Bank anyway.""

She said Netanyahu was ""making it look like he's a peacemaker when in reality he's moving forward with everything he's been doing in the West Bank for years.""

As for Gaza's reconstruction, the Middle East analyst is hopeful the enclave will return to being a place where Palestinians could thrive.

""I am optimistic that in the long run, Gaza will return to being a habitable place.""





The Israeli army says that the bodies of four hostages held in Gaza have been brought back to Israel.

The four coffins arrived at the National Institute for Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv, where their identification process will take place.

While all living hostages have been returned to Israel, the Palestinian militant group Hamas still holds the bodies of 24 others.



The United Nations on Monday announced that it would reallocate about $11 million (€9.5 million) in emergency funding to help scale up humanitarian assistance in the Gaza Strip before winter sets in.

A deputy UN spokesperson said the move followed a similar reallocation of $9 million last week as UN humanitarian organizations race to insure sufficient fuel supplies and life-saving necessities will be ready to go into the devastated enclave as the situation on the ground allows.

Despite general relief over the ceasefire, UN Humanitarian Affairs Coordinator Tom Fletcher was quick to point to one major part of the war that has not stopped: the civilian humanitarian crisis in Gaza. 

Fletcher noted that ""without fresh contributions"" from member states, ""critical aid cannot keep flowing to people who rely on it."" 

Israel, which had blocked almost all aid into Gaza for months, has now begun to allow larger quantities into the enclave.

A UN analysis has described the situation in Gaza as a man-made disaster and accused Israel of deliberately creating famine conditions for the civilian population, a claim Israel denies.

More than 67,000 Palestinians were killed during the two years of war that followed a Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023.

Even though the ceasefire plan has been signed, success is not guaranteed because competing demands remain to solve the conflict.

Israel wants Hamas to disarm, and Hamas wants Israel to pull its troops out of all of Gaza. The future of Gaza's government, which has been in Hamas' hands for two decades, also remains to be worked out.

Here are issues that remain unsolved.

""Egypt will work with the United States in coordination with partners in the coming days to lay the foundation for the reconstruction of the Strip, and we intend to host an early recovery, reconstruction and development conference,"" Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said on Monday.

El-Sissi has asked US President Trump, who told world leaders that ""rebuilding is maybe going to be the easiest part,"" to support the conference.

In Sharm El-Sheikh on Monday, Trump said: ""We know how to build better than anybody in the world.""

The World Bank and Egypt's postwar plans envision reconstruction and recovery costs in Gaza upwards of $53 billion (€46 billion). 

US President Donald Trump announced ""peace in the Middle East"" as he officially signed off his plan for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

""Together we have achieved what everybody said was impossible,"" Trump said, alongside the leaders of Egypt, Qatar and Turkey, all of whom were key mediators in bringing about the deal.

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi praised Trump for sealing the ceasefire in Gaza, saying the deal ""closes a painful chapter in human history and opens a new era of peace and stability"" for the region.

El-Sissi also announced that the US president will be awarded Egypt's top civilian honor. 

As people in the Gaza Strip return home after a fragile ceasefire, many find only rubble and loss, writes DW correspondent in Jerusalem, Tania Krämer. With homes destroyed and futures uncertain, the scars of war run deep — and the hope for peace remains fragile.

Here's the article in full.

During a bilateral meeting in Egypt, President Trump said that the second phase of peace negotiations between Hamas and Israel was already underway.

""It's started far as we're concerned,"" Trump told reporters while sitting next to Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fattah el-Sissi. ""As you know, the phases are all a little bit mixed up with each other,"" Trump said, adding that the Gaza Strip ""needs a lot of cleaning up.""

If you're just joining us, here are three helpful things to remember. One,Hamas has released all living Israeli hostages, and Israel has released nearly 2,000 Palestinians it had held under a US-led ceasefire deal.

US President Trump, whose administration brokered the deal, addressed the Israeli parliament, hailing the ""historic dawn of a new Middle East."" Trump then flew to Egypt to host a summit on Gaza, with at least 20 world leaders in attendance. 

And the return of bodies of just four hostages by Hamas has families accusing the militant group of violating the ceasefire agreement, with the Hostage and Missing Families Forum calling for an ""immediate suspension"" of the peace deal until every deceased hostage is returned. 

 

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi praised US President Donald Trump ahead of a summit aimed at supporting the ceasefire reached in Gaza.

According to el-Sissi, Trump was ""the only one"" who could bring peace to the region.

In return, Trump praised el-Sissi as ""very powerful,"" adding that Egypt has ""very little crime"" because ""they don't play games."" El-Sissi had led the military overthrow of Egypt's first democratically elected president in 2013.

Hamas has handed over the coffins of two dead hostages to the Red Cross, the Israeli military said.

The remains of two other hostages are also expected to be transferred to the aid group today.

The militant group earlier this morning freed Israeli hostages in the first step of a long-awaited ceasefire deal. 

 

Red Cross officials were on their way to pick up a number of coffins bearing the remains of deceased hostages, the Israeli military said in a statement.

The Israeli military said the organization is ""on its way to the meeting point"" in the southern part of the Gaza Strip, where ""several coffins"" will be transferred into Red Cross custody.

Earlier Monday, Hamas said it would only return four of the 28 bodies held in the enclave on Monday. ","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

Donald Trump is preparing to arm Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles as he turns his attention to ending its war with Russia.

The US president was lavished with praise for bringing peace to the Middle East during a jubilant visit to Israel on Monday.

World leaders used a subsequent summit in Sharm El-Sheikh to back Mr Trump to solve the conflict in Ukraine. The US president will meet Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House on Friday.

The two leaders are due to discuss their “visions” for how the long-range Tomahawk missile could bring Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table, according to Mr Zelensky.

“The main topics will be air defence and our long-range capabilities, to maintain pressure on Russia,” the Ukrainian leader said.

Mr Trump threatened to deliver the Tomahawks to Kyiv if Putin continued to stifle any hope of peace talks.

He has recently ramped up intelligence-sharing with Ukrainian forces to assist their long-range strikes on Russian energy targets, increasing pressure on Russia's stuttering economy.

Mr Trump touched down in Tel Aviv on Monday to celebrate the release of 20 Israeli hostages as part of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.

After declaring lasting peace, he jetted off to Egypt to meet world leaders for the signing of the first phase of a White House deal to bring an end to the war in Gaza.

In a speech to Israel's parliament, Mr Trump said he would now focus his efforts on brokering a deal to end the war between Ukraine and Russia.

“It would be great if we could make a peace deal with [Iran]... First, we have to get Russia done,” he told the Knesset. “Let's focus on Russia first.”

With the war in Gaza over, Mr Trump has claimed to have ended eight conflicts since taking office in the White House in late January.

However, a deal to end the three-and-a-half-year fight between Ukraine and Russia has eluded him and remains problematic. Mr Trump has struggled for leverage in a deal with Putin.

But he extolled the White House policy of “peace through strength” in the Middle East on Monday, leading to renewed hope.

Mr Zelensky said the US president's Israel-Hamas deal “brings more hope” to other regions suffering from war.

“We are working so that the day of peace comes for Ukraine as well. Russian aggression remains the last global source of destabilisation, and if a ceasefire and peace have been achieved for the Middle East, the leadership and determination of global actors can certainly work for us, too,” the Ukrainian president wrote on social media.

His prime minister and top aide flew to Washington on Monday to begin “high-level talks to strengthen Ukraine's defence, secure our energy resilience, and intensify sanctions pressure on the aggressor”.

With speculation mounting that Mr Trump could ship Tomahawks to Ukraine, Mr Zelensky is expected to present him with a lengthy list of Russian military targets that could be struck with the missiles.

Kyiv hopes the weapon will be able to disrupt Moscow's ability to wage war by severing logistical routes and destroying missile and drone factories.

Tomahawks have a range of around 1,500 miles, which would put such targets comfortably within range.

Mr Zelensky has previously claimed the missile would pressure Putin to the negotiating table to discuss a ceasefire.

The provision of Tomahawks would mark a major escalation in American support and a hardening of Mr Trump's stance against Putin.

Mr Trump said sending the missile to Kyiv would mark a “new step of aggression”.

His predecessor, Joe Biden, had rebuffed Ukraine's requests for Tomahawks.

“I might say, look, if this war's not going to get settled, I'm going to send them Tomahawks,” Mr Trump said on Sunday on his flight to Israel.

“I might have to speak to Russia, to be honest with you, about Tomahawks. Do they want to have Tomahawks going in their direction? I don't think so.”

Referring to Putin, Mr Trump said: “I might tell him that if the war is not settled, that we may very well do it.”

Since the two leaders' landmark meeting in Alaska, Mr Trump has become increasingly frustrated with his Russian counterpart for refusing to engage in meaningful negotiations with Kyiv.

Mr Trump's threat followed phone calls between himself and Mr Zelensky, with the two leaders becoming increasingly aligned from the low point of their public spat at the White House earlier this year.

Moscow has warned the White House against providing Tomahawks, saying the move would effectively sever relations with Washington.

On Sunday, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said the missiles were of “extreme concern” to Russia, adding: “Tensions are escalating from all sides.”

Moscow would not be able to tell if the missiles were carrying nuclear warheads if they were launched at its territory, he claimed, asking: “Just how should Russia react?”

Putin and his top officials have refrained from directly criticising Mr Trump over the missiles in the hope they can still convince him to back down.

			The US president teased Canada's new PM Mark Carney, slipping in a pointed dig at former leader Trudeau

Donald Trump poked fun at Justin Trudeau during a hot mic moment at the Gaza ceasefire summit in Egypt.

Following his address, Mr Trump shared a light-hearted interaction with Mark Carney, the Canadian prime minister, while his microphone was still on and cameras were still rolling.

“Well, I'm glad you upgraded me to president,” Mr Carney quipped before laughing.

Mr Trump responded by playfully slapping Mr Carney's arm, shielding his mouth and saying: “At least I didn't say governor.”

The comments appeared to be a joke at the expense of Justin Trudeau, the former Canadian prime minister, whom Mr Trump mercilessly mocked during his final months in office, repeatedly calling him “governor Trudeau” and threatening to make Canada America's “51st state”.

Mr Trudeau's ailing poll ratings exacerbated by a trade war with the US caused by Mr Trump's tariffs ultimately forced him to step down as prime minister in January.

Conversely, the president's jibes bolstered support for Mark Carney, whose pledge to fight back against Mr Trump's threats saw him jump in the polls to win Canada's March election.

During his victory speech, Mr Carney said: “President Trump is trying to break us so America can own us. That will never ... ever happen.”

Since entering office, the Canadian prime minister has fostered a surprisingly warm relationship with the president despite their initial hostilities.

“We have great love for each other,” Mr Trump said during an Oval Office meeting with Mr Carney earlier this month, calling him a “world class negotiator”.

During the meeting, Mr Carney listed the American president's accomplishments, when Mr Trump interrupted to add: “The merger of Canada and the United States,” drawing laughter from in the room.

Mr Carney batted away the suggestion, saying: “That wasn't where I was going.”

The meeting marked Mr Carney's second visit to the White House in five months, as he faces increasing domestic pressure to strike a deal on US tariffs on steel, cars, and other goods that are hurting Canada's economy.

Mr Trump has promised to treat Canada “fairly” on tariffs, but has so far been unwilling to shift his stance, despite Ottawa dropping some counter-tariffs and scrapping a digital services tax aimed at US tech companies.

Mr Carney initially responded to tariffs by pushing for a separate trade and security deal with the US, but as talks ran into trouble, he switched his attention to a review of the US-Canada-Mexico free trade deal scheduled for next year.

Canada sends 75 per cent of all exports to the United States and is particularly vulnerable to US trade action.

Opponents of Mr Carney have called for the prime minister to “hit back hard” against Mr Trump's tariffs.

Doug Ford, the Ontario premier, told reporters earlier this month: “It's like a kid going in the school yard and getting punched in the face every day.”

			Man spends $10m on 15 plots in his hometown of Altadena as Gavin Newsom warns of ‘greedy speculators taking advantage'

A $2bn (£1.5bn) lottery winner has bought more than a dozen plots of land left empty by the Los Angeles wildfires, amid criticism of “disaster capitalism”.

Edwin Castro spent $10m buying 15 locations in his hometown of Altadena, which is located a short distance from downtown LA, pledging to restore the “old neighbourhood”.

However, residents are concerned about developers snapping up cheap property from families devastated by the fires, while Gavin Newsom, the California governor, has warned of “greedy speculators taking advantage”.

Altadena bore the brunt of the Eaton Fire, one of several massive blazes which broke out in January, which killed 18 people and thousands of homes.

Mr Castro, who holds the record for the biggest lottery win in history after taking the $2bn powerball jackpot in 2022, said he wants to sell redeveloped homes at market value. He opted to take a $997m (£748m) lump sum before tax instead of $2bn spread out over 29 years.

“I want it to feel like the old neighbourhood,” he told The Wall Street Journal. “Like if you put all those houses pre-fire in a time bubble.”

The profit “doesn't need to be egregious”, Mr Castro said, adding: “But I'm not building these homes just to give them away.”

However, some residents fear they will be driven out by developers aggressively carving up the area, and according to the Daily Mail a petition to block investors from purchasing property has around 1,500 signatures.

LAist reported last week that of the 241 properties sold in the town through to September, more than half were bought by developers.

“ It's a textbook example of disaster capitalism, where people are targeted while they're grieving and overwhelmed,” said Iris Craige, of the Strategic Actions for a Just Economy (SAJE) non-profit, calling it a “second wave of disaster for Altadenans”.

In January, Mr Newsom issued an executive order to protect residents left homeless by the wildfires from “greedy speculators taking advantage of their pain”.

“I have heard first-hand from community members and victims who have received unsolicited and predatory offers from speculators offering cash far below market value – some while their homes were burning,” he said.

“We will not allow greedy developers to rip off these working-class communities at a time when they need more support than ever before.”

A spokesman for Mr Castro told the Mail that the Powerball winner “grew up in Altadena and considers it [his] home”.

“They love and care about the Altadena community and saw an opportunity to invest in it that would also help some impacted homeowners move forward while helping it retain its character and charm,” he continued.

“Many people who were affected by the fires in Altadena cannot or do not want to rebuild and aspire to move on and start over elsewhere.

“These purchases will help some of them, while keeping ownership of the property local.

“They anticipate that half the lots that were purchased will use the pre-existing plans, and the others will remain single family homes with new plans and designs.”

            JPMorgan Chase on Monday announced a massive investment plan that places a substantial bet on industries it thinks are critical to the United States' economic security.
    


            As part of the decade-long initiative, the bank said it's investing $10 billion in select companies that are primarily based in the United States and do business in one of four key areas: supply chain resilience, energy independence, defense and strategic technologies like AI and quantum computing. The investment, which will come from JPMorgan's capital, directly, and from venture capital, is designed to enhance large and mid-sized companies' growth and drive innovation and strategic manufacturing, according to a press release.
    


            The plan aims to facilitate $1.5 trillion in investments over 10 years. JPMorgan had previously aimed at delivering $1 trillion in investments to these initiatives.
    


            “It has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing – all of which are essential for our national security,” said CEO Jamie Dimon, in a statement.
    


            The announcement comes as President Donald Trump revived a trade war between the US and China on Friday, with Trump threatening to impose new triple-digit tariffs on Chinese imports.
    


            Trump's threat followed Beijing's tightening of its control on rare earths, a group of critical minerals essential in the production of a wide range of electronics, automobiles and semiconductors. However, on Sunday, the Trump administration appeared to soften its tone, and markets were set to rebound Monday.
    


            But the renewed tensions demonstrated how a major investment in companies aimed at US self-reliance could pay off in a new era of tariffs, trade wars and standoffs.
    


            “Our security is predicated on the strength and resiliency of America's economy. America needs more speed and investment,” Dimon said.
    


            The initiative will help ensure reliable access to critical medicines, minerals, defense capabilities, and energy and microchips to power AI, Dimon said. Rising tensions around the world, particularly with China, have challenged America's ability to secure all of those crucial needs.
    


            JPMorgan will hire an unspecified number of additional bankers and other investment staffers to execute its investment strategy, and it will create an external council to help guide it, the bank said.
    


            Shares of JPMorganChase (JPM) rose more than 1% in premarket trading.
    


            “Hopefully, once again, as America has in the past, we will all come together to address these immense challenges,” Dimon said. We need to act now.”

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Donna Adelson, the matriarch of a wealthy South Florida family who was convicted in the hired killing of her former son-in-law, was sentenced Monday to life in prison for her role in the 2014 murder-for-hire of Daniel Markel. 

A prominent Florida State University law professor, Markel was locked in a bitter custody battle with his ex-wife, Adelson's daughter, when he was gunned down in 2014 at his home in Tallahassee.

Adelson, 75, was found guilty last month of first-degree murder, conspiracy and solicitation after a weekslong trial. She was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for the murder charge, with an additional 30 years for the other two counts, to be served consecutively. Adelson has pledged to appeal.

In an emotional statement ahead of the sentencing in a Tallahassee courtroom, Adelson swore she was innocent and cast her trial as a miscarriage of justice, overseen by a jury she said was unduly swayed by years of negative media coverage. 

“What happened to Danny is unforgivable. But I am an innocent woman convicted of this terrible crime without evidence,” Adelson said. 

“I've always respected the law. I've never gotten a parking ticket, But I'm going to prison for a murder I did not commit,” she added.

Circuit Judge Stephen Everett interrupted Adelson multiple times, warning her the statements showed what he termed an “utter lack of remorse” for the crime.




Shackled and dressed in a purple jail jumpsuit, Adelson stood attentively while Everett handed down the sentence. “You certainly can choose to deny your involvement and maintain innocence. The court finds the evidence in this case is clear,” Everett said.

The case had captivated people in Florida for more than a decade amid sordid details of a messy divorce, tensions with wealthy in-laws and custody fights leading to the killing. 

Adelson was the fifth person sentenced for what prosecutors say was a plot to kill Markel. Among those already serving a life sentence for the killing is Adelson's son, Charles Adelson.

At trial, prosecutors had painted Donna Adelson as the calculated and controlling matriarch of an affluent South Florida family with the means and motive to orchestrate the killing of the ex-son-in-law she “hated.” 

Defense attorneys insisted the state didn't have sufficient evidence to link the aging grandmother to the murder plot, instead emphasizing the roles played by others and casting suspicion on two of Adelson's adult children. Wendi Adelson denied involvement in the killing and has not been charged.

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — North Carolina Republican legislative leaders announced plans Monday to vote next week on redrawing the state's U.S. House district map, taking up President Donald Trump's call to secure more GOP seats nationwide and resist rival moves by Democrats.

The push to retool already right-leaning boundaries for the ninth-largest state comes amid a major party battle spanning several states to revamp district lines to partisan advantage ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

North Carolina Republicans created a map in 2023 that resulted in GOP candidates winning 10 of the state's 14 U.S. House seats in 2024. That compared to a 7-7 seat split between Democrats and the GOP under the map used in 2022.

Now only one of the House districts –- the 1st District currently represented by Democratic Rep. Don Davis –- is considered a true swing district and could be targeted by the GOP for an 11th seat. Davis won a second term last year by less than 2 percentage points, so shifting slightly portions of the district covering more than 20 northeastern counties could help a Republican candidate in a strong GOP year. But it could weaken districts held by GOP incumbents.

The state's top Republican legislators said their planned action follows Trump's “call urging legislatures across the country to take action to nullify Democrat redistricting efforts.” Davis wasn't mentioned by name in their news release.

Trump “earned a clear mandate from the voters of North Carolina and the rest of the country, and we intend to defend it by drawing an additional Republican Congressional seat,” House Speaker Destin Hall said in the release. Trump has won North Carolina's electoral votes all three times that he's been on the presidential ballot. 

But state House Democratic leader Robert Reives said Monday his GOP colleagues “are stealing a congressional district in order to shield themselves from accountability at the ballot box.”

Trump kickstarted the national redistricting battle over the summer by urging Republican-led Texas to reshape its U.S. House districts so the GOP could win more seats next year. After overcoming a Democratic walkout, Texas lawmakers redrew the districts to give Republicans a shot at five more seats.

California Democrats reciprocated by passing their own redistricting plan aimed at helping their party win five additional seats, a plan needing voter approval in November to be implemented.

And lawmakers in Republican-led Missouri have approved revised U.S. House districts intended to help Republicans pick up an additional seat there. Other states also are considering redistricting, including Republican-led Indiana and Kansas.

Some North Carolina GOP lawmakers focused complaints Monday on California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who advanced his state's redistricting effort. 

“Picking up where Texas left off, we will hold votes in our October session to redraw North Carolina's congressional map to ensure Gavin Newsom doesn't decide the congressional majority,” Senate leader Phil Berger said. 

Responding on X, Newsom called Berger “another lap dog Republican” and accused the GOP of “rigging elections and trying to cover it up with lies.”

North Carolina lawmakers already had planned for a multiday session starting Oct. 20. Republicans hold majorities in both General Assembly chambers and redistricting plans aren't subject to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein's veto stamp. Candidate filing for 2026 is supposed to begin Dec. 1.

Addressing voters, Stein said in a statement that “shameless politicians are abusing their power to take away yours” with a redraw.

An intensely competitive midterm election looms in which Democrats need to gain just three seats to take control of the House. The president's party historically has lost seats in midterm elections, something Trump is trying to avoid. A Democratic takeover could impede Trump's agenda and lead to investigations of his actions, as occurred during his first term in office.

If and how North Carolina legislators create a more favorable redraw may depend on pending litigation filed by the state NAACP, Common Cause and voters challenging several current congressional districts, including the one represented by Davis, one of three Black representatives from North Carolina. The plaintiffs accuse Republican lawmakers of racially discriminating against Black voters by splitting or packing their voting blocs to help GOP candidates win. The trial ended in July without an immediate ruling. 

U.S. House districts typically are redrawn once a decade, after a census. But some states have no prohibition on doing it more frequently. And the U.S. Supreme Court has said there is no federal prohibition on political gerrymandering, in which districts are intentionally drawn to favor one party.

Opponents have filed lawsuits alleging Texas' latest redistricting unconstitutionally dilutes the votes of minority residents and that Missouri's mid-decade redistricting isn't allowed under the state constitution. Meanwhile, Utah's Republican-led Legislature recently endorsed an altered congressional map — though in response to a court order, not Trump's demands.

This story has been corrected to show North Carolina's 1st District covers more than 20 counties, not less than 20.

President Donald Trump, addressing the Israeli Knesset, urged Israel to work toward peace following the U.S.-brokered ceasefire and hostage deal, an agreement that he declared had effectively ended the Israel-Hamas war and opened the door to building a more stable Middle East.

US President Donald Trump's speech in the Israeli Knesset was briefly interrupted on Monday before two lawmakers were escorted out of the chamber. One of them held up a sign reading “Recognize Palestine”.

President Donald Trump heads next to Egypt for a summit with more than two dozen other nations after urging Israel to seize chance for peace. Trump is running hours late because speeches at the Knesset continued longer than expected.

U.S. President Donald Trump was welcomed Monday at the Israeli parliament. AP reporter Darlene Superville was in the room at the Knesset.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday declared a “historic dawn of a new Middle East” in a speech to lawmakers in the Israeli parliament.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged that he was “committed to this peace” as he addressed the Israeli Parliament during a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump to the country on Monday.

As Israel and Hamas traded hostages and prisoners on Monday, taking a first step toward peace, U.S. President Donald Trump addressed the Knesset, Israel's parliament, telling them he had ended his eighth war. 

“After so many years of unceasing war and endless danger, today the skies are calm. The guns are silent. The sirens are still. And the sun rises on a holy land that is finally at peace,” Trump said.

He then upped the number of wars he claims to have ended in his first eight months in office, saying, “Yesterday I was saying seven, but now I can say eight.” 

But Trump's claim is exaggerated. Much work remains before an end to the war between Israel and Hamas can be declared. That's also true in other countries where Trump claims to have ended wars. 

Here's a closer look:

While the ceasefire and hostage deal is a major achievement, it is still an early and delicate moment in the path to a permanent end to the war, let alone a two state solution. 

The first steps of the agreement Trump brokered included the release of hostages in Gaza, the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israel, a surge of humanitarian aid and a partial pullback by Israeli forces from Gaza's main cities.

But major elements remain to be worked out.

After his stop in Israel, Trump gathered with other world leaders in Egypt for a “ Summit of Peace ” to discuss the ceasefire plan. Trump acknowledged that leaders had taken the “first steps to peace” and urged leaders to build on the breakthrough. Trump and other leaders signed a document that he said would “spell out a lot of rules and regulations and lots of other things, and it's very comprehensive,” though details were not immediately available.




The next phase of talks is expected to address disarming Hamas, creating a post-war government for Gaza, reconstruction, and the extent of Israel's withdrawal from the territory. Trump's plan also stipulates that regional and international partners will work to develop a new Palestinian security force. 

At least some, if not all, of those elements need to be worked out, and negotiations over those issues could break down. Trump envoy Steve Witkoff said on Monday that he and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, were “already working” on implementation issues.

Trump is credited with ending the 12-day war.

In June, Israel launched attacks on the heart of Iran's nuclear program and military leadership, saying it wanted to stop Tehran from building a nuclear weapon. Iran has denied it was trying to do that.

Trump negotiated a ceasefire after directing American warplanes to strike Iran's Fordo, Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites. 

Evelyn Farkas, executive director of Arizona State University's McCain Institute, said that Trump should get credit for ending the war.

“There's always a chance it could flare up again if Iran restarts its nuclear weapons program, but nonetheless, they were engaged in a hot war with one another,” she said. “And it didn't have any real end in sight before President Trump got involved and gave them an ultimatum.”

Lawrence Haas, a senior fellow for U.S. foreign policy at the American Foreign Policy Council who is an expert on Israel-Iran tensions, agreed the U.S. was instrumental in securing the ceasefire. But he characterized it as a “temporary respite” from the ongoing “day-to-day cold war” between the two countries that often involves flare-ups.

This could be described as tensions at best, and peace efforts, which do not directly involve the United States, have stalled.

The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile River has caused friction between Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan since the power-generating project was announced more than a decade ago. In July, Ethiopia declared the project complete. It was inaugurated in September.

Egypt and Sudan oppose the dam. Although the vast majority of the water that flows down the Nile originates in Ethiopia, Egyptian agriculture relies on the river almost entirely. Sudan fears flooding and wants to protect its own power-generating dams.

During his first term, Trump tried to broker a deal between Ethiopia and Egypt. He could not get the countries to agree and suspended aid to Ethiopia over the dispute. In July, he posted on social media that he helped the “fight over the massive dam (and) there is peace at least for now.” But the disagreement persists, and negotiations between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan have stalled.

“It would be a gross overstatement to say that these countries are at war,” Haas said. “I mean, they're just not.”

The April killing of tourists in Indian-controlled Kashmir pushed India and Pakistan closer to war than they had been in years, but a ceasefire was reached.

Trump has claimed that the U.S. brokered the ceasefire, which he said came about in part because he offered trade concessions. Pakistan thanked Trump, recommending him for the Nobel Peace Prize. India has denied Trump's claims, saying there was no conversation between the U.S. and India on trade in regards to the ceasefire.

Although India played down the Trump administration's role in the ceasefire, Haas and Farkas believe the U.S. deserves some credit for helping stop the fighting.

“I think that President Trump played a constructive role from all accounts, but it may not have been decisive. And again, I'm not sure whether you would define that as a full-blown war,” Farkas said.

The White House lists the conflict between Serbia and Kosovo as one Trump resolved. But there has been no threat of a war between the two neighbors during Trump's second term or any significant contribution from the Republican president this year to improve relations.

Kosovo is a former Serbian province that declared independence in 2008. Tensions have persisted since, but never to the point of war, mostly because NATO-led peacekeepers have been deployed in Kosovo, which has been recognized by more than 100 countries.

During his first term, Trump negotiated a wide-ranging deal between the countries, but much of what was agreed on was never carried out.

Trump has played a key role in peace efforts between the African neighbors, but he is hardly alone and the conflict is far from over.

Eastern Congo, rich in minerals, has been battered by fighting with more than 100 armed groups. The most potent is the M23 rebel group. It is backed by neighboring Rwanda, which claims that it is protecting its territorial interests and that some of those who participated in the 1994 Rwandan genocide fled to Congo and are working with the Congolese army.

The Trump administration's efforts paid off in June, when the Congolese and Rwandan foreign ministers signed a peace deal at the White House. The M23, however, was not directly involved in the U.S.-facilitated negotiations and said it would not abide by the terms of an agreement that did not involve it.

The final step to peace was meant to be a Qatar-facilitated deal between Congo and M23 that would bring about a permanent ceasefire as well as a final agreement to be signed separately between Congo and Rwanda as facilitated by the administration. However, talks have stalled between the different parties amid setbacks, and deadly fighting continues in eastern Congo.

In August, Trump hosted the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan at the White House, where they signed a deal aimed at ending a decades-long conflict. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan called the signed document a “significant milestone.” Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev hailed Trump for performing “a miracle.”

The agreements were intended to reopen key transportation routes and reaffirm Armenia's and Azerbaijan's commitment to signing a peace treaty. The treaty's text was initialed by the countries' foreign ministers at that meeting, which indicated preliminary approval. But the two countries have yet to sign and ratify the deal.

Armenia and Azerbaijan have been in a bitter conflict over territory since the early 1990s, when ethnic Armenian forces took control of the Karabakh province, known internationally as Nagorno-Karabakh, and nearby territories. In 2020, Azerbaijan's military recaptured broad swaths of territory. Russia brokered a truce and deployed about 2,000 peacekeepers to the region.

In September 2023, Azerbaijani forces launched a lightning blitz to retake remaining portions. The two countries have worked toward normalizing ties and signing a peace treaty ever since.

Officials from Thailand and Cambodia credit Trump with pushing the Asian neighbors to agree to a ceasefire in this summer's brief border conflict.

Cambodia and Thailand clashed in the past over their shared border. The latest fighting began in July after a land mine explosion along the border wounded five Thai soldiers. Tensions had been growing since May, when a Cambodian soldier was killed in a confrontation that created a diplomatic rift and roiled Thai politics.

Both countries agreed in late July to an unconditional ceasefire during a meeting in Malaysia. 

Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim pressed for the pact, but there was little headway until Trump intervened. Trump said on social media that he warned the Thai and Cambodian leaders that the U.S. would not move forward with trade agreements if the hostilities continued. Both countries faced economic difficulties and neither had reached tariff deals with the U.S., though most of their Southeast Asian neighbors had.

According to Ken Lohatepanont, a political analyst and University of Michigan doctoral candidate, “President Trump's decision to condition a successful conclusion to these talks on a ceasefire likely played a significant role in ensuring that both sides came to the negotiating table when they did.”

HALF MOON BAY, Calif. (AP) — A California engineer and gardening enthusiast won the top prize at an annual pumpkin-weighing contest in Northern California after growing a giant jack-o'-lantern gourd weighing 2,346 pounds (1,064 kilograms).

Brandon Dawson, of Santa Rosa, California, clinched the victory Monday at the 52nd World Championship Pumpkin Weigh-Off in Half Moon Bay, south of San Francisco. 

Dawson pumped his arms in the air and sat his two children on top of the giant pumpkin — roughly the same weight as a small sedan or a large bison — after being crowned this year's winner. 

“My mind is kind of racing because I was in this position last year when I lost by 6 pounds (3 kilograms),” he said in an interview.

Dawson, a manufacturing engineer at electric vehicle maker Rivian Automotive, said he has been growing massive pumpkins for five years. Precision skills acquired at his job helped him with the right watering and sunlight to help his gourd grow, he said. 

He said he enjoys getting his children involved in the process.

“We like to spend time out in the patch and watch the thing grow,” Dawson said about his 2-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter. 

“My 4-year-old now can really pay attention to the growing process,” especially since the giant pumpkins can grow by 50 to 70 pounds (23 to 32 kilograms) a day, he added.

Dawson's pumpkin was the runner up in last year's contest at Half Moon Bay when the winning gourd grown by Minnesota horticulture teacher Travis Gienger came in at 2,471 pounds (1,121 kilograms). 

Gienger, of Anoka, Minnesota, set a world record at the California contest in 2023 for the heaviest pumpkin when his giant jack-o'-lantern gourd weighed 2,749 pounds (1,247 kilograms). Gienger's pumpkin was damaged earlier this season and he couldn't enter this year's contest in California. 

Two brothers in England earlier this month broke Gienger's record with a gourd that weighed 2,819 pounds (1,278kg).

WASHINGTON (AP) — A new round of layoffs at the Education Department is depleting an agency that was hit hard in the Trump administration's previous mass firings, threatening new disruption to the nation's students and schools in areas from special education to civil rights enforcement to after-school programs.

The Trump administration started laying off 466 Education Department staffers on Friday amid mass firings across the government meant to pressure Democratic lawmakers over the federal shutdown. The layoffs would cut the agency's workforce by nearly a fifth and leave it reduced to less than half its size when President Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20.

The cuts play into Trump's broader plan to shut down the Education Department and parcel its operations to other agencies. Over the summer, the department started handing off its adult education and workforce programs to the Labor Department, and it previously said it was negotiating an agreement to pass its $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio to the Treasury Department.

Department officials have not released details on the layoffs and did not immediately respond to a request for comment. American Federation of Government Employees Local 252, a union that represents more than 2,700 department workers, said information from employees indicates cuts will decimate many offices within the agency.

All but a handful of top officials are being fired at the office that implements the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, a federal law that ensures millions of students with disabilities get support from their schools, the union said. Unknown numbers are being fired at the Office for Civil Rights, which investigates complaints of discrimination at the nation's schools and universities.




The layoffs would eliminate teams that oversee the flow of grant money to schools across the nation, the union said. It hits the office that oversees Title I funding for the country's low-income schools along with the team that manages 21st Century Community Learning Centers, the primary federal funding source for after-school and summer learning programs.

Without staff overseeing funding for high-poverty schools or special education, schools may face delays in receiving reimbursement from the federal government, said Sasha Pudelski, director of advocacy for the American Association of School Administrators. 

“We're talking about the people who worked on the beating heart of our federal public school programs,” Pudelski said.

The layoffs will also eliminate teams that oversee TRIO, a set of programs that help low-income students pursue college, and another that oversees federal funding for historically Black colleges and universities.

In a statement, union president Rachel Gittleman said the new reductions, on top of previous layoffs, will “double down on the harm to K-12 students, students with disabilities, first generation college students, low-income students, teachers and local education boards.”

The Education Department had about 4,100 employees when Trump took office. After the new layoffs, it would be down to fewer than 2,000. Earlier layoffs in March had roughly halved the department, but some employees were hired back after officials decided they had cut too deep.

The new layoffs drew condemnation from a range of education organizations. Although states design their own competitions to distribute federal funding for after-school programs, a small team of federal officials provided guidance and support “that is absolutely essential,” said Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance.

“Firing that team is shocking, devastating, utterly without any basis, and it threatens to cause lasting harm,” Grant said in a statement.

If upheld, the cuts will make it impossible for the government to fulfill its duties carrying out special education laws, according to a statement from the National Association of State Directors of Special Education.

The layoffs will reduce the department's special education office from roughly 200 workers to about five, said Katy Neas, CEO of The Arc of the United States, which advocates for people with disabilities. Neas, who helped lead the office under former President Joe Biden, said families rely on those teams to make sure states and schools are following complex disability laws.

One prominent example dates to Trump's first term, when the special education office determined that Texas had illegally placed a cap on the number of students who could receive special education services in each district. Under pressure from the U.S. Education Department, Texas lawmakers lifted the cap in 2017.

“As a result, tens of thousands of children in Texas now can access the education support that they need, whereas before they couldn't,” Neas said.

The government's latest layoffs are being challenged in court by the American Federation of Government Employees and other national labor unions. Their suit, filed in San Francisco, said the government's budgeting and personnel offices overstepped their authority by ordering agencies to carry out layoffs in response to the shutdown.

In a court filing, the Trump administration said the executive branch has wide discretion to reduce the federal workforce. It said the unions could not prove they were harmed by the layoffs because employees would not actually be separated for another 30 to 60 days after receiving notice. ___

From Seattle to Baltimore, many Americans were celebrating Monday as Indigenous Peoples Day, determined to see it as a triumph of perseverance over centuries marked by trauma. Tribal nations and communities gathered at powwows, markets and musical performances among other joyful events to honor their culture and their history.

Some states and cities have for decades now made the second Monday in October about honoring Native Americans alongside the Italian explorer Christopher Columbus, for whom the federal holiday was declared in 1937. And President Joe Biden signed a declaration recognizing both days. 

President Donald Trump, keeping a vow he made in April, reversed that last week, pledging “to reclaim his extraordinary legacy of faith, courage, perseverance, and virtue from the left-wing arsonists who have sought to destroy his name and dishonor his memory.” 

Trump's tribute to the explorer whose planting of the Spanish flag in the Caribbean in 1492 opened the Americas to “the ultimate triumph of Western civilization” — along with centuries of disease, slavery and conquest that ravaged Indigenous civilizations — is drawing criticism and resignation from Native Americans. 




But some advocates say his posture is hardly unique among previous presidents, and they won't be dissuaded from seeking to build consensus for tribal goals.

This is the first year Indigenous Peoples Day has state recognition in Montana, after a decade-long campaign in the state that is home to 12 federally recognized tribes.

What changed? Democratic State Sen. Shane Morigeau, a citizen of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes who sponsored the legislation, framed it not as a holiday that would eliminate Columbus Day, but as a day of “inclusivity, healing and bringing people together.”

“It's just not an us-versus-them type of day. It's a day that brings everyone together,” Morigeau said. “And if you don't want to go check that out and you want to go do something else and celebrate the other day, you can do that too and our feelings won't be hurt.”

What matters is that both Native and non-Native people can go to an event or do some self-reflection or even “go down to the river and go fishing for the day,” Morigeau said.

After the protests over the Dakota Access Pipeline in 2016 and the racial injustice protests in 2020, more people and institutions questioned the narrative of Columbus as only an intrepid sailor and explorer, arguing for a more complete understanding of his historical impact. Trump's proclamation lambastes this as the villainizing of a “true American hero.”

“Outrageously, in recent years, Christopher Columbus has been a prime target of a vicious and merciless campaign to erase our history, slander our heroes, and attack our heritage,” Trump's proclamation reads. “Left-wing radicals toppled his statues, vandalized his monuments, tarnished his character, and sought to exile him from our public spaces.”

Chase Iron Eyes, director of the Lakota People's Law Project, said it's Trump who is making this a culture war, when the day should be about learning all aspects of history around Columbus.

“If Trump wants to celebrate the good things about Christopher Columbus then let him. Let him do that. But also tell the truth about him and let us also celebrate Indigenous peoples' accomplishments,” said Iron Eyes, who is of the Lakota Sioux Nation. “We don't teach that in America's schools.”

The National Congress of American Indians found it profoundly troubling when Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced last month that the soldiers who killed more than 250 men, women and children in the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre would retain their military honors after a review launched under the Biden administration.

Hegseth called it part of his effort to root out “woke” thinking. 

Iron Eyes, who lives on Pine Ridge, called it hurtful.

“We have kids who pay attention,” Iron Eyes said. “When Pete Hegseth is doubling down on wanting to honor people who slaughtered noncombatants and women and children and elderly, the kids are paying attention.”

This has only reinvigorated the Lakota People's Law Project's campaign to persuade Congress to rescind the Wounded Knee military medals, he said.

“We've made hard-fought sacrifices to get to a place where we're saying to each other, ‘Hey, let's tell the truth about each other,'” Iron Eyes said. “Natives aren't savage. They're not impediments to progress. They're not antithetical to civilization.”

In September, Trump's Education Department redirected nearly $500 million in federal funding from schools serving large contingents of Hispanic students, promising the money instead for historically Black colleges and tribal colleges. This could double federal funding to roughly $108 million across the United States for tribal colleges and universities, or TCUs.

“That's what Indian Country wants, to continue to invest in our tribal citizens and Native people and to be contributors to not only our tribal economies, but to the U.S. economy as a whole,” said Larry Wright Jr., executive director of the National Congress of American Indians.

There are 35 accredited TCUS with over 90 campuses across 15 states, most of which are in Indian Country, according to the American Indian Higher Education Consortium.

The consortium lauded the funds as “progress toward fulfilling federal trust and treaty obligations” while also noting that it could raise more obstacles for students at non-TCU schools. Many Native Americans are enrolled at the universities that are losing federal funding.

Tribal appropriations were initially included in the Trump administration's efforts to claw back federal spending that it sees as promoting diversity, equity and inclusion. Wright gives credit that the administration heard NCAI officials out and understood “Indian Country is not DEI” — and that there are treaties and trust responsibilities that must be met. He said they've had productive conversations with the administration and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.

“To have that kind of alignment with this administration is a good thing in spite of all the other rhetoric. Truly more so than anything else, I think, from a micro aspect, Indian Country really is dependent on bipartisan efforts to to make sure our issues aren't overlooked and forgotten,” Wright said.

Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on mounting concerns as the shutdown continues on 'Special Report.'

The National Hockey League played seven games in its young 2025-2026 season by the end of the day last Wednesday. The contests featured a grand total of two fights. 

The government shutdown had run for eight days by the end of the day on that Wednesday. And the now lengthy shutdown sparked two extraordinary verbal brawls in the halls of Congress between lawmakers.

NHL referees Gord Dwyer and Mitch Dunning worked the Washington Capitals/Boston Bruins tilt Wednesday night in DC. Perhaps the House and Senate Sergeants at Arms could have summoned Dwyer and Dunning up to Capitol Hill to dole out a few ten-minute misconducts beforehand.

""You're embarrassing yourself right now!"" hollered House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., at Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y.

""The only embarrassment here is you!"" thundered Lawler at Jeffries.

Tempers exploded as Lawler lay in wait outside the House Radio/TV Gallery Studio for a shutdown smackdown after Jeffries concluded his now-daily press conference. 

""You're not going to talk to me and talk over me when you don't want to hear what I'm going to say!"" yelled an animated Jeffries at Lawler, jabbing his index finger toward his colleague's chest but never poking him. 

""Oh, I'm listening,"" said Lawler.

""So just keep your mouth shut!"" shouted the usually cool Jeffries. 

There were multiple rounds of vocal fisticuffs between Members and Congressional leaders.

Sens. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., and Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., summoned the press to the hallway outside the office of House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to complain about the shutdown and criticize the Speaker for not swearing-in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., more than two weeks after her election. Johnson then confronted the Arizona senators. And Lawler was nearby, serving as ""fourth man in.""

""This is absurd,"" seethed an exasperated Johnson.

SCREAMING MATCH ERUPTS BETWEEN HAKEEM JEFFRIES, MIKE LAWLER AS GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN CHAOS CONTINUES

""This is the longest the House has gone…"" interrupted Gallego.

""Do you want me to answer the question?"" shot back Johnson.

""You're not actually answering the question,"" countered Gallego.

The multiple rounds of brawls in the halls between lawmakers were nearly unprecedented in Congress. The shutdown smackdowns featured arguments about health care. Lawler waved around legislation focused on the Democrats' push during the shutdown: a package to extend Obamacare subsidies.

""If you believe in it so much!"" chided Lawler, with a rhetorical uppercut. 

""Bro, do you understand math?"" counterpunched Jeffries.

Tensions are spiking at the Capitol. Yours truly asked Johnson about Lawler confronting Jeffries and his decision to step out of the Speaker's Office to engage Kelly and Gallego. I noted to the Speaker that if the House was in session, there may be fistfights in the hallways.

""Are you concerned and is it incumbent upon you as the Speaker to try to lower this temperature?"" I asked.

Johnson added that the contretemps ""concerns me."" He added that he wanted to ""restore civility to the institution.""

""Let's have policy disputes. But not make it personal. This gets personal. Emotions are high. People are upset. I'm upset. I'm a very patient man. But I am very angry right now because this is dangerous stuff. And so is it better for them to be physically separated right now? It probably is."" said Johnson. 

Lawmakers aren't the only ones raging. Thousands of federal workers are fuming at the shutdown. The administration is now firing federal workers. 

""Right now, many families are paying the price for political gridlock that they didn't cause,"" said American Federation of Government Employees President Everett Kelley.

TENSE CONFRONTATION BETWEEN HOUSE SPEAKER, SENATE DEMS CAUGHT ON CAMERA OVER SHUTDOWN

Rep. Sarah Elfreth, D-Md., represents 44,000 federal employees in her district near Washington, DC. She notes that Maryland has lost 15,000 federal jobs since President Trump took office in January. 

""I believe that (the firings) are not only unethical and immoral, but illegal for him to be RIF-ing people during a shutdown. There's no new authority granted to the President or OMB during a shutdown,"" said Elfreth. ""I don't believe in negotiating by threat. It also shows that I think they have the weaker hand and that they're losing the PR battle nationally to resort to threats."" 

While the shutdown is the main event, the undercard is a fight between Democrats and Johnson over Grijalva to succeed her late father, Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz. The elder Grijalva died in March after a battle with cancer.

""I can't hire staff. We don't have an office,"" said Grijalva ""So it's very much second-class citizen feeling for me.""

Democrats have tried on multiple occasions to compel the House to swear-in Grijalva during brief, pro forma sessions where the body gavels in and gavels out after just a few seconds. Once in office, Grijalva would provide the crucial 218th signature to go over the head of the Speaker and force the House to vote on a measure to release the Epstein files.

""Get your people in and stop covering up for the pedophiles,"" shouted Gallego at Johnson during their confrontation in the corridor.

""That's ridiculous,"" responded Johnson. 

""There's nobody covering up for pedophiles,"" chirped Lawler from the back of the scrum. ""So knock it the hell off.""

Johnson denies the Grijalva holdup is about the Epstein files.

""We'll schedule it, I guess, as soon as she wants. It has nothing to do with it,"" said Johnson. 

But Grijalva wrote to the Speaker last week demanding the House swear her in immediately. And the House still hasn't sworn her in.

Circumstances were different this spring when the House GOP majority dwindled to a net seat of one. Republicans needed as many votes as they could muster to pass parliamentary frameworks for the Big, Beautiful Bill. Johnson swore-in Reps. Randy Fine, R-Fla., and Jimmy Patronis, R-Fla., a day after they won special elections.

""These guys worked hard and they earned the position,"" said Johnson when he met with them back in April. ""These gentlemen are going to come in and help us deliver the America First agenda."" 

Johnson noted that swearing-in Fine and Patronis made ""the margin a little more comfortable"" for House Republicans.

So Johnson is keeping the House out of session for now. House Democrats are returning to Capitol Hill this week to make a point of Johnson keeping the House out of session during the shutdown. Regardless, pouring everyone back into the Capitol would likely trigger the Congressional equivalent of a line brawl. 

There are unwritten rules about hockey fights. You don't sucker punch someone. You don't knee your opponent. You generally square off in a fight with someone in your same weight class. In hockey, both sides warm up on their own side of the red line before the game and between periods. Violation of that code might trigger a big brawl.

Lawmakers from both sides seemingly left their own side of the rink to pick fights with the other side. Gallego and Kelly outside the Speaker's Office. Lawler outside Jeffries' news conference.

But lawmakers are apparently ignoring these unwritten rules. The government shutdown soon enters its third week and everyone is dropping their gloves.

Surveillance video shows a woman being dragged from a front porch, screaming for help. Credit: Wichita Police Department

Wichita police are asking for the public's help identifying a woman reportedly taken by force early Sunday morning — an incident that has left neighbors uneasy.

Authorities posted photos and surveillance footage showing the woman last seen around 2 a.m. Sunday, Oct. 12, in the 1400 block of North Volutsia, between Grove and Hillside. Investigators said they have pursued multiple leads throughout the day and thanked the community for its support.

""We've worked throughout the day on this investigation, following up on numerous leads, and we appreciate the public's help,"" the department shared in a post on X.

So far, neither the man nor the woman seen in the footage has been identified. Police said they are considering all possibilities and have enlisted help from regional and federal agencies.

The 20-second clip shows a woman being dragged away from the front door as she screams for help.

The footage appears to have been captured by a residential security camera, according to authorities, a common feature in the neighborhood.

Investigators enhanced the video's audio to reduce background noise, hoping someone might recognize the woman's voice. Police urged residents to review the footage carefully and contact detectives at 316-268-4407 with any information.

""Your assistance is vital in helping us ensure her safety,"" the department wrote on Facebook.

Investigators also followed up on a call from Oklahoma initially believed to be connected to the case but later determined to be unrelated.

One resident, who recently returned from visiting family in Mexico, said the situation has her worried for young women in the area.

""It's dangerous. That's the truth. But, always, I believe there have always been kidnappings,"" she told KAKE News, adding that she had never seen anything like this happen in her neighborhood.

As of Monday afternoon, police reported no significant updates. Investigators told Fox News Digital that they are continuing to analyze the video frame by frame, looking for any details that could help identify the people involved.

Check out the die-hard Steelers fans reactions to Aaron Rodgers' being their new quarterback.

Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin took a shot at Cleveland Browns general manager Andrew Berry on Monday over the decision to trade Joe Flacco to a team within their division.

The Browns traded the Super Bowl champion quarterback to the Cincinnati Bengals last week after benching him for rookie Dillon Gabriel. The Browns, Steelers and Bengals each play in the AFC North.

Tomlin and the Steelers dominated the Browns in Week 6 and now play the Bengals on Thursday night to start Week 7.

""To be honest, it was shocking to me,"" Tomlin said of the trade, via Pro Football Talk. ""Andrew Berry must be a lot smarter than me or us, because it doesn't make sense to me to trade a quarterback that you think enough of to make your opening starter to a divisional opponent that's hurting in that area. But that's just my personal feeling.""

Tomlin went on to praise Flacco's savviness as he gets more ingrained into the Bengals' offense.

Flacco led the Browns to a victory over the Green Bay Packers on Sept. 21. His performance in that game gave fans and experts the expectation that he would help the Bengals on Sunday.

Flacco had 219 passing yards and two touchdown passes, but the Packers came out on top 27-18.

Penn State Nittany Lions athletic director Pat Kraft made the decision to fire head football coach James Franklin, and he told reporters on Monday that it wasn't just the three-game losing streak that led to the decision.

Franklin's departure is a shock to college football, as the leader in the locker room since 2014 parts ways with the Nittany Lions, who will have a whopping $50 million buyout to pay him. 

Kraft said he was ""looking at everything"" after Penn State's loss to Northwestern, 22-21, on Saturday.

""I felt after sitting down Saturday and looking at everything, at where we were in terms of the best interest of the athletes and where the program was going that we had to make the hard decision,"" Kraft told reporters, via Sports Illustrated. ""Looking at where the program was, where it is, and where we want to be, I felt that there was no other course. I felt it was time.""

This is a Penn State program that was ranked No. 2 in the country before the season started. They went 3-0 to begin, but have been in a free fall since. It came to a head against an unranked Northwestern team, as fans' chants to fire Franklin roared even louder than they were when Oregon went into Beaver Stadium and handed them their first loss. 

PENN STATE FIRES JAMES FRANKLIN AFTER STUNNING LOSS TO NORTHWESTERN: REPORT

Kraft and Franklin have had a longstanding friendship as well as a professional relationship, making his firing hard on many levels. 

""James Franklin is a good friend who has always carried himself with dignity, and represented Penn State with absolute class,"" Kraft explained. ""We are all fortunate to have had James Franklin to lead this program for more than a decade and we wish nothing but the best for him and his family.""

The Nittany Lions will be led by Terry Smith, Franklin's assistant coach, who has been named the interim head coach. 

Franklin took over as Penn State's head coach before the 2014 season after leading Vanderbilt for three seasons in the same role. He was in his 12th season at Penn State, having brought the team to the College Football Playoff semifinals last season. 

As the team's head coach, Franklin was 104-45. 

Looking ahead, Penn State will be without quarterback Drew Allar for the remainder of the season due to a leg injury suffered in the loss to Northwestern. They will head into a matchup with Iowa next week, but the schedule gets much harder from there.

Penn State will see No. 1 Ohio State on Nov. 1, No. 7 Indiana on Nov. 8, and four or more losses would keep them out of the College Football Playoff for this season.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sat down with ‘Life, Liberty & Levin' to explain why he nominated President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.

Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday announced that he intends to nominate President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in securing a ceasefire and hostage agreement between Hamas and Israel.

It will be Pakistan's second time putting up Trump for the prize. In June, Pakistan nominated Trump for his role in securing a ceasefire agreement between Islamabad and neighboring India.

""Pakistan had nominated President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his outstanding, extraordinary contributions to first stop the war between India and Pakistan and then achieve a ceasefire, along with his very wonderful team,"" Sharif said in Egypt, speaking next to Trump.

""And today, again, I would like to nominate this great president for the Nobel Peace Prize because I genuinely feel that he is the most genuine and most wonderful candidate for the Peace Prize because he has brought not only peace in South Asia, saving millions of people and their lives,"" he added. ""And today, here in Sharm el-Sheikh, achieving peace in Gaza is saving millions of lives in the Middle East.""

Trump and Sharif were part of a delegation of world leaders gathered in Egypt's coastal resort area of Sharm el-Sheikh to sign documents related to the peace deal in Gaza.

After announcing his intention to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, Sharif turned to the president and made a brief saluting gesture toward him.

""Mr. President, I would like to salute you for your exemplary, visionary leadership. I think you are the man this world needs most at this point in time. The world will always remember you as a man who did everything — who went out of his way to stop seven and, today, eight wars,"" Sharif added.

Last week, the Nobel Committee in Norway awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado.

While introducing the other world leaders, Trump appeared to chide Norway over last week's choice.

Scores of people linked to the Chinese government, sometimes card-carrying members of the Chinese Communist Party and intelligence assets, have cut large checks to officials occupying posts at the local, state, and national levels in recent years.

Efforts by the federal government to combat these influence operations have been limited and have failed to stop Beijing's policy of changing U.S. policy with cold hard cash.

In just the last couple of weeks, investigations from the Washington Examiner and the Washington Free Beacon have revealed that members of the CCP are injecting cash into competitive gubernatorial races in New Jersey, Virginia, and Arizona to assist Democratic candidates.

“Federal campaign finance law strictly prohibits foreign nationals and foreign governments from contributing any money or making any independent expenditures in American candidate elections,” former Federal Election Commission member Hans von Spakovsky told the Washington Examiner. “And it doesn't just apply to federal elections, but that statute also applies to state and local elections … So if someone in the state of Virginia, a candidate, is getting a donation from someone who is not a U.S. citizen, that's a violation of federal law.”

In the case of Arizona, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs vetoed a slate of legislation aimed at curtailing China's influence in the state, including bills that would have banned healthcare and research institutions from using genetic sequencing equipment manufactured by Pentagon-designated “Chinese military companies,” prohibited the use of Chinese-manufactured telecommunications hardware, and blocked infrastructure contracts with Chinese-owned entities. 

After these vetoes, Pin Ni, an automobile component executive identified in corporate documents as a member of the CCP, cut a $10,000 check to the Democratic Governors Association of Arizona — one of the main political committees poised to support Hobbs financially as she stands for reelection in 2026.

Wanxiang Group, where Pin serves on the board of directors, has been praised by Chinese President Xi Jinping for being “in line with the Party Central Committee” and “always actively [doing] what our Party committees and governments at all levels advocate.”

“It's a pretty fishy kind of thing that the Democratic Governors Association takes that kind of donation,” Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ), who is challenging Hobbs for the governor's mansion in 2026, said of the story. “That same organization has identified this election, the governor's election, as their No. 1 [to] protect.”

The same kind of behavior that Biggs called “fishy” has led to legal complaints elsewhere.

The Chinese executive also cut checks in support of Reps. Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ) and Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) to support their runs for governor in their respective states. 

Pin, who has been recognized as an “outstanding Communist Party Member” 15 times, would likely be forbidden by Chinese law from holding citizenship or permanent residency in the United States — the statuses legally necessary to make campaign contributions — due to his CCP membership. 

National Legal and Policy Center counsel Paul Kamenar said his group would file complaints with the FEC following the reports of donations in New Jersey and Virginia.

The FEC may have its work cut out for it, as previously unreported federal campaign finance records show that executives at Wanxiang Group have donated nearly $1 million since 2000 to federal political committees, with the bulk of their spending occurring in the last five years. Beneficiaries of the Chinese cash include big names such as former President Joe Biden, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the Democratic National Committee, Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT), various state Democratic Parties, and Mike Pence's 2024 presidential campaign. While some of the contributions were directed toward Republicans, the vast majority were made out to Democrats. 

Despite the troves of evidence, the FEC and Justice Department have historically been criticized for inaction regarding foreign influence campaigns.

“The FEC, the regulatory agency charged with administering and enforcing federal campaign finance laws, suggested it would prioritize cases implicating the ban on foreign election spending,” Campaign Legal Center director of campaign finance reform Saurav Ghosh wrote in 2022. “Yet the FEC's repeated failure to enforce the laws banning foreign money in our elections belies that commitment. The FEC recently deadlocked and closed a matter where a U.S. company, American Ethane Co., used money from Russian oligarchs to support federal candidates and PACs during the 2018 election cycle.”

Ghosh was referring to a bipartisan FEC investigation in 2019, which found that a company 88% owned by foreign nationals with no domestic income made campaign contributions. Despite the prior uncontested finding, the FEC deadlocked once it came time for enforcement.

The FEC's enforcement powers come in the form of civil penalties like fines. Although criminal charges from the DOJ are a possibility, the standard for conviction is relatively high, requiring proof that a political committee accepted foreign funds knowingly and willingly.

Understaffing at the DOJ is another possible reason why so few investigations related to China-linked campaign finance infractions seem to be occurring.

“Federal election crimes, and that includes campaign finance violations, are the responsibility of the public integrity section of the criminal division of the Justice Department,” von Spakovsky, who now serves as a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, told the Washington Examiner. “The last time I checked, they only had two lawyers, two, inside the public integrity section in what they call the election crimes unit, whose job it is to investigate election crimes, which includes these kind of campaign finance violations. Two lawyers, which is frankly ridiculous and a misapplication of resources.”

Indeed, the unit referenced by von Spakovsky was slashed from 36 lawyers when President Donald Trump took office in January to just two as of September.

Kamenar, whose organization has considerable experience trying to get the FEC to enforce campaign finance law, told the Washington Examiner that short staffing and inaction are problems at the agency as well.

“Unfortunately, the FEC takes their time to investigate these kinds of cases, especially when they were shorthanded in terms of the number of commissioners,” the lawyer said. “Everything was put on hold back a couple of years ago during COVID and so forth. And even if they have a requisite number of commissioners, they're still slow in acting on it and getting back to the complaining party about what they did.”

Kamenar said that multiple of the National Legal and Policy Center's complaints issued to the FEC appear to have gone into a “black hole,” including one concerning Virginia Democrat Terry McAuliffe's 2021 gubernatorial campaign accepting $350,000 from a company owned by a British national and another alleging that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) “failed to properly disclose hundreds of thousands of dollars in fundraising expenses and violated campaign contribution limits.”

The FEC and DOJ did not respond to requests for comment.

Wanxiang and its donors are just one piece of a much larger story involving Chinese donations and apparent inaction from the relevant authorities. While Chinese money has a clear presence in state and national politics, state-linked actors also have a strong interest in impacting local politics through campaign contributions. Donors with ties to the Chinese government appear to concentrate their activities in major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Boston.

Earlier this year, the Daily Caller News Foundation released a pair of reports showing that individuals involved in China's United Front Work Department — a global network of party loyalists that the Chinese government has tasked with gathering intelligence and exerting influence — had bankrolled the mayors of Los Angeles and Boston and secured influence in their administrations.

In the case of Los Angeles, Dominic Ng and Simon Pang, a pair of bankers who held positions with the United Front Work Department, donated over $1 million to Democratic Mayor Karen Bass's campaign account and the Mayor's Fund for Los Angeles, a nonprofit organization where she serves as an adviser to the board of directors. Following those contributions, the two men were appointed to her mayoral transition advisory team in December 2022.

Democratic Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, meanwhile, saw a United Front Work Department official named Gary Yu raise over $300,000 in support of her mayoral campaign. Wu and Yu have been photographed together on numerous occasions, signaling his proximity to her administration.

A 2023 Newsweek investigation similarly found that organizations and community leaders with close links to China's United Front Work Department had donated over $1 million to New York politicians at all levels of government since 1990. The report implicated big names in New York politics such as Mayor Eric Adams (D), former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (D), and Rep. Grace Meng (D).

Some localities, seeing federal enforcement as insufficient, have passed their own laws aimed at curbing foreign influence. Colorado, for instance, prohibits contributions by majority foreign-owned corporations. Seattle, taking it a step further, bans donations by companies with even minor foreign ownership stakes.

While Chinese influence efforts appear to target Democrats more often than not, that is not always the case.

Chinese donors have attempted to make inroads with Trump, with some success. After he took office in 2017, CCP-linked donors began cutting hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of checks to his reelection campaign, the Wall Street Journal reported in 2020. Following these payments, donors with links to the Chinese state secured meetings with Trump and GOP lawmakers and access to a closed-door Republican strategy meeting.

One such donor, Xinyue “Daniel” Lou, faces federal prosecution for campaign finance violations. Luo is accused of routing money from a foreign national through otherwise legal donors in what is called a straw donor scheme. According to prosecutors, he did this to secure tickets to an exclusive event at Mar-a-Lago for a Chinese national, who was legally ineligible to make donations and therefore get tickets himself.

Chinese-backed straw donor schemes have received attention from Congress, with the Republican-led House Administration Committee claiming in 2024 to have discovered evidence suggesting that purportedly lax security on the Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue has enabled foreign adversaries such as China to make donations in the names of citizens without their knowledge. 

When these straw donor schemes lead to convictions, the consequences aren't what one might expect.

Hui Qin, a Chinese entertainment magnate, was sentenced to time served, satisfied by the seven months he spent in pre-trial detention after he pleaded guilty to running a straw donor scheme that illegally funneled cash into congressional campaigns in New York and Rhode Island, and an undisclosed municipal election in New York City in 2021. Hui had initially faced up to 27 years in prison.

Though the FEC and DOJ have attracted criticism for, in the telling of some, not being aggressive enough in the face of foreign influence, the Trump administration has signaled that the issue is on its radar. In April, the president ordered an investigation into the alleged straw donor scheme flagged by congressional Republicans last year.

Kamenar was also optimistic that the new administration would bring increased enforcement activity against foreign influence efforts. 

Sometimes, to the ire of national security hawks, donations linked to the CCP are made in unambiguously legal ways.

Corporations with well-established links to the Chinese government, like Alibaba or Pentagon-designated Chinese military companies such as drone manufacturer DJI Technology and tech conglomerate Tencent, hire U.S. lobbyists to influence policy on their behalf. These lobbyists, often themselves U.S. citizens or permanent residents, can then make campaign donations to the lawmakers they're attempting to influence — a practice academic research suggests improves their access to power brokers. 

Employees of CCP-linked corporations with U.S. citizenship or permanent residency can also make campaign contributions. BYD Americas President Ke Li, who corporate documents identify as a Chinese national with permanent residency in the U.S., for instance, made headlines in October 2024 when it was reported that she donated $40,000 to Biden's reelection effort on the same day his administration approved a subsidy for her firm, which has been accused of working with the Chinese government to accomplish its strategic goals.

CONGRESS IS INVESTIGATING THIS COMPANY FOR AIDING THE CCP. ITS LEADERS HAVE CUT LARGE CHECKS TO DEMOCRATS

Direct campaign contributions are just one vector through which actors linked to the Chinese government seek to influence U.S. policymaking. Entities with links to the CCP support domestic advocacy groups, spend tens of millions of dollars on lobbyists, prop up pro-China media outlets that degrade the U.S. while touting the alleged achievements of Beijing, pay social media conglomerates to boost their propaganda, utilize party loyalists employed by Western companies to steal trade secrets, cut massive checks to universities, exploit “sister city” programs to sway local politics, and work to secure positions at standards development organizations, which set industry regulations that affect the entire world, among myriad other operations.

“Xi Jinping's ambitions for ideological control are not limited to his own people,” then-national security adviser Robert O'Brien said in 2020. “The CCP's stated goal is to create a ‘Community of Common Destiny for Mankind,' and to remake the entire world according to the CCP. The effort to control thought beyond the borders of China is well underway.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A New Jersey county that could play a decisive role in the next month's statewide elections will be reprinting its general election ballots after the Republican National Committee successfully argued that a ballot redesign unlawfully favored Democrats.

The dispute began late last month when Democratic County Clerk James Hogan replaced Gloucester County's legally required party-column ballot format, where each political party's candidates appear under a single vertical heading, with an office-block layout that grouped all candidates for each race together, regardless of party.

Republicans argued the change undermined their visibility on the ballot and blunted their “Vote Column A” campaign after winning the position of Column A in the county's ballot drawing. On Friday, a state appellate court ruled that Hogan's layout violated the law and ordered reprints of ballots in time for early voting later this month.

The panel overturned an earlier ruling by Superior Court Judge Benjamin Telsey, who had agreed the design was illegal but allowed the ballots to stand, citing possible voter confusion. The appellate court said those concerns were unsupported by evidence and ordered new, column-style ballots for in-person voting.

“The existing ballot design does not comply with [state laws] which plainly require ballots for the general election to be arranged in a ‘column' format,” the judges wrote, according to a portion of the ruling seen by New Jersey Globe. “Defendants point to nothing in these provisions that would afford a county clerk any discretion to depart from that format.”

The move was especially controversial because Gloucester is one of several swing counties in New Jersey that have trended more Republican in recent years. Of the state's 21 counties, 18 saw double-digit point swings toward President Donald Trump between 2020 and 2024. Only Burlington, Gloucester, and Cape May saw single-digit shifts, but those were still in Trump's favor.

The design change could have limited Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli's influence in Gloucester County, where two competitive state Assembly seats and control of the county government are also on the line this year. 

Ciattarelli is facing off against Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill to determine who will succeed Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.

Election officials must now prepare the column ballot design by Wednesday to meet the Oct. 25 early voting deadline. Mail voters will still use the old office-block ballots, while in-person voters will receive corrected versions.

Last month, Telsey ruled that the clerk's design violated state law but declined to order a reprint. Telsey did, however, order the county to reimburse Republicans $26,007 for campaign materials affected by the illegal ballot design.

CIATTARELLI PLANS TO FILE DEFAMATION LAWSUIT AGAINST SHERRILL IN NEW JERSEY GUBERNATORIAL RACE

The lawsuit was backed by RNC Chairman Joe Gruters and led by attorneys for the Dhillon Law Group, founded by Harmeet Dhillon, now the assistant attorney general who leads the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division.

“Democrats in New Jersey tried to secretly redesign ballots to make it harder for voters to choose Republican candidates,” Gruters said following the decision Friday. The “court made clear they cannot ignore state election law.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Hamas is only expected to release the bodies of four killed Israeli hostages on Monday, a small fraction of the more than two dozen bodies the group agreed to release.

The terrorist group released all 20 living hostages on Monday, but only four of the 28 deceased hostages, according to the Hostage Family Forum, despite the ceasefire deal calling on Hamas to release all 48 living and deceased hostages within three days of the commencement of the agreement.

“The hostage families were shocked and dismayed to learn that only four deceased hostages will be returned today, out of 28 held by Hamas,” the forum said. “This represents a blatant breach of the agreement by Hamas. We expect Israel's government and the mediators to take immediate action to rectify this grave injustice.”

The 20 living hostages were reunited with their families and given initial medical attention ahead of more comprehensive care.

TRUMP CELEBRATES ‘GOLDEN AGE' OF ISRAEL AND MIDDLE EAST

President Donald Trump, the lead proponent of the deal that ultimately ended the war, met with many of the hostage families and also addressed Israel's Knesset on Monday.

Ronen Neutra, the father of deceased U.S.-Israeli citizen Omer Neutra, whose body is still being held by Hamas, “reminded [President Trump] that it's not over until the 28 deceased hostages,” according to the New York Post.

“It's a continual horror for the families,” Neutra said. “The 28 families like us sit on the Knesset benches listening to the glorious speeches, and we don't know when we're going to get our son.”

“Will it be today, in two hours, in one week, or never? And it's very difficult to be in that position,” he continued. “And it's not over. There are 28 families in agony, and that's our problem. And we're just hoping that it's not going to be a celebration of victory until the last hostage is back.”

There was speculation, furthered by comments from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, that not all of the bodies would be handed over in the agreed-upon time frame. Netanyahu also suggested Israel would have to find the bodies, and that Hamas may not be able to locate them.

ALL LIVING ISRAELI HOSTAGES FREED FROM HAMAS CAPTIVITY

“We will bring the deceased hostages to burial in Israel,” Netanyahu said late last week. “We will work to locate all of them as soon as possible, and we will fulfill this as a sacred duty of mutual responsibility.”

It's unclear whether Hamas intends to release additional bodies in the coming days and how that could affect the deal, if at all.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump played diplomat and stand-up comedian during his speech at the Knesset, where he celebrated the release of all living hostages from Gaza.

Speaking before the Israeli legislature on Monday, Trump offered a series of off-the-cuff remarks and jokes about corruption scandals, the handsome features of Israel Defense Forces soldiers, his billionaire funders, and his daughter's marriage.

Some of the bits were light-hearted and observational, such as his bemusement by the Hebrew pronunciation of the Abraham Accords — the 2020 normalization agreement between Israel, Bahrain, Morocco, the United Arab Emirates, and Sudan.

“I like calling it the ‘Avraham Accords' — ‘Avraham' — it's so cool, it's so much nicer, you know?” Trump told the crowd, to laughter from the lawmakers. “I just don't want to sound too sanctimonious when I do it.”

At another point, Trump expressed his appreciation for the name of the U.S. military's Jun. 22 airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.

“Midnight Hammer — boy, that's a great name for what we did,” he said, smiling.

Gesturing toward IDF personnel in attendance, Trump called the soldiers “central casting” for their good looks.

“Let's put 'em in a movie,” Trump said. “You could get rich making movies.”

However, some of Trump's comments went beyond observational and provided glimpses of his relationships with members of the audience.

While praising Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his leadership during wartime, Trump unexpectedly called on Israeli President Isaac Herzog to pardon “Bibi.”

“Hey, I have an idea — Mr. President, why don't you give him a pardon?” Trump said to massive applause. “By the way, that was not in the speech, as you probably know. But I happen to like this gentleman right over here, and it just seems to make so much sense.”

Netanyahu is facing three criminal charges for corruption by Israeli courts on allegations that he received illicit gifts.

“Cigars and champagne? Who the hell cares about that?” Trump joked about the allegations before adding, “Okay, enough controversy for the day.”

However, veiled behind Trump's expressions of support for the Jewish state was an undercurrent of political realism as he fluctuated between optimism and grim warning.

“I've always stood for the people of this community, and I always will. I'll always be with you. I'm always gonna be with you,” Trump said before walking that promise back.

“I guess maybe something could happen to change my mind — somebody that's really stupid gets into office and wants to do really bad things, but that's about it,” he continued. “We don't think we're gonna have that happen, I hope we're not gonna have that happen.”

Another subject of Trump's comments was Miriam Adelson, the Israeli American billionaire who worked with her late husband, Sheldon Adelson, to advocate Israeli interests to the president and contributed massively to his 2024 campaign.

“Look at her sitting there so innocently. Sixty billion in the bank […] and she loves Israel,” Trump said after asking Adelson to stand up.

Trump reflected on Adelson's husband's constant requests for meetings, recalling, “He'd call up [and say] ‘Can I come over and see you?' and I'd say ‘Sheldon, I'm the president of the United States, it doesn't work that way.' [But] he'd come in.”

However, Trump's comments about the Adelsons took an awkward turn when he speculated that the cash-flush political donor is more invested in the fate of Israel than the U.S.

“I'm gonna get her in trouble with this — I actually asked her once, I said, ‘So Miriam, I know you love Israel. What do you love more, the United States or Israel?' She refused to answer. That might mean Israel,” Trump said.

The comment received a muted response.

Other targets of Trump's remarks included his daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner.

While thanking Kushner for his role in finalizing the peace deal, Trump said his son-in-law “loves [Israel] so much that my own daughter converted.”

“I didn't know this was going to happen,” he remarked before turning to Netanyahu. “And Bibi, you do know this was not in the cards for me.”

“And she is so happy and they are so happy — at least I think they're happy!” he joked. “If they're not happy, we have a big story, right? Nah, they have a great marriage.”

Trump did not stay long in Israel, leaving the Knesset and getting on a plane to Egypt.

How much more whiplash can the CDC withstand?

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

It was a strange weekend for employees of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to say the least. On Friday, hundreds of workers at the agency, many of whom have been furloughed since the federal government shut down on October 1, found out they were being fired as part of widespread layoffs across federal agencies. Less than a day later, a curt follow-up email landed in many of their inboxes informing them that they weren't being let go after all. No explanation, no apology.

Staffers spent the weekend trading calls and texts, trying to piece together who had been axed, who had been spared, and, most puzzling, why. “There's really no strategy that they're using, no real approach—at least any thoughtful approach—to how they are doing these cuts,” Daniel Jernigan, who directed the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases before he resigned in August, told me.

I spoke with half a dozen current and former CDC officials, and foremost on their mind was what they described as the ineptitude of the botched downsizing. For example, almost all editors of the “Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report,” which the CDC has published since 1960, were among those notified on Friday night that their work was “unnecessary or virtually identical to duties being performed elsewhere in the agency.” By Saturday, several CDC sources told me, they had their jobs back.

Andrew Nixon, the communications director for Health and Human Services, wrote in an email that “the employees who received incorrect notifications were never separated from the agency and have all been notified that they are not subject to the reduction in force.” He declined to answer specific questions about layoffs.

Many of the cuts that have stuck so far seem to conflict with the administration's stated aims. A branch of the National Center for Health Statistics that coordinates an annual survey of the dietary habits of Americans—a topic presumably of interest to those attempting to make America healthy again—was eliminated, according to its former chief, David Woodwell. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has accused the agency's vaccine advisory board of being “plagued with persistent conflicts of interest” and insisted that such conflicts must be eliminated in order to restore Americans' trust in the CDC. And yet, the agency's human-resources office—which handled ethics issues—has been scrapped, according to Alt CDC, a team of anonymous public-health officials that has been crowdsourcing updates on the firings. “I would think, if you are monitoring for conflicts of interest, particularly when you've accused the agency of having them, you would want to have an office to do that,” Debra Houry, who was the CDC's chief medical officer until she resigned in August, told me.

One veteran researcher who still has his job (and, like other public-health workers I spoke with for this story, requested anonymity for fear of losing it) told me he believes that Kennedy's ultimate goal is to “silence the scientific voice of career CDC scientists.” And indeed, perhaps the clearest result of the firings is that they appear to consolidate Kennedy's power over the agency. Every member of the CDC's Washington office, which serves as a conduit between the agency's Atlanta headquarters and Capitol Hill, was fired; barring a second round of reversals, that office appears to be closed. The person managing Alt CDC's Bluesky feed yesterday, who identified herself as an epidemiologist in a state health department, told me she'd heard that CDC personnel who normally share information with state officials during outbreaks have been eliminated. “So the only contact they have is going to HHS—is going to RFK,” the epidemiologist told me.

For CDC scientists who received layoff notices, the past few days have been disorienting. I spoke with one longtime scientist at the agency who learned on Friday that she would lose her job but then, on Saturday, received an email with the subject line “Rescission of Previous Notice of Reduction in Force.” In other words, her job—deemed redundant the day before—was again apparently necessary. She told me that her short-lived firing “felt like the culmination of eight months of abuse” under the Trump administration. She was particularly distressed by Kennedy's June decision to fire the entire vaccine advisory board and stack it with his allies, but recent months have offered even more opportunities for stress and indignation. In August, a gunman who blamed COVID vaccines for his depression opened fire on the agency's Atlanta campus, killing a police officer. (The veteran scientist told me she shopped online for a bulletproof vest to wear to work, though she ended up not buying one.) Weeks later, Kennedy pushed out the agency's newly confirmed director, Susan Monarez. Three top CDC officials—Houry, Jernigan, and Demetre Daskalakis, the former director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases—subsequently resigned in protest.

Read: ‘It feels like the CDC is over'

On Friday, hours before layoff notices went out, Jim O'Neill, who took over as acting CDC director after Monarez's ouster, posted two photos on X of what appeared to be a bald eagle soaring over the Capitol building. His message: “Good morning we are going to win.” For the people I spoke with who remain at the CDC, what exactly the acting director hopes to win—and for whom—isn't clear, in part because they haven't heard anything else from O'Neill. On Friday, instead of discussing the growing turmoil at the agency he oversees, Kennedy posted on X congratulating President Donald Trump for his new drug-pricing deal and defending comments he made at a recent Cabinet meeting linking autism with the use of Tylenol after circumcision. As of this evening, he still hadn't addressed the firing about-face.

A moment for radical hope

Today at 9:30 a.m., Air Force One made a low pass over Tel Aviv on its way into Ben Gurion Airport. The flight had more in common with an astronomical portent—a medieval comet, say, and all the swings in mood that might entail among the public—than a mere act of aviation. Israelis had stayed up for days in hopes that hostages would be released. The sight of the 747 meant: This is really happening. Within a few hours, it had happened. Hamas surrendered the last 20 of its living hostages to Israel and began the process of returning the remains of dozens more. (One hundred and forty had previously been released, eight had been freed in Israeli raids, and the remaining 75 or so are presumed dead.) Israel, having withdrawn its forces from much of Gaza on Friday, released 1,968 Palestinian prisoners.

The Israelis who had let themselves get carried away with expectant joy during the past few days were for once not punished for their optimism. Gazans who for two years had become accustomed to dozens of their neighbors being killed every day, on average, by Israel suddenly enjoyed the possibility of a hiatus. A war that started with the murder of more than 1,000 Israelis by Hamas, and went on to kill more Gazans than can be precisely counted, appears to have ended. This afternoon, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke in the Knesset and declared victory. Donald Trump spoke next and said that today the sun had risen on “a Holy Land that is finally at peace,” after Israel had achieved “all that can be won by force of arms.” Any hope in the region is largely due to the fact that Trump will look like a chump if the deal collapses, and that he will do anything to avoid chump status and destroy those who would make him into one.

Read: How Trump pushed Israel and Hamas to yes

I spent some of these moments of glee in East Jerusalem, at the home of the Palestinian philosopher Sari Nusseibeh. Nusseibeh, 76, was president of Al-Quds University from 1995 to 2014 and the Palestinian Authority's representative in Jerusalem from 2001 to 2002. During that time, he toiled for a two-state solution—a vision of peace that for the past two years has seemed not only elusive but positively quaint. He has been out of politics for decades now, and told me that for much of the past two years he had preserved his sanity by avoiding too much Gaza news and watching South Korean soap operas instead.

Israel demands that Hamas disarm and vanish. Hamas still refuses. I told Nusseibeh I feared that the hiatus would not last, that Hamas would pop up from the rubble and blow up an Israeli military vehicle, and that the war would resume. He chided me for my pessimism: Hamas had little to gain from spoiling the peace at this point, and the Israelis would not be foolish enough to expose themselves to attacks of this sort. (A U.S. official in Israel told me that keeping Israel from responding to such a provocation is a high-priority task assigned to Secretary of State and National Security Adviser Marco Rubio.) The Trump plan calls for a force, made up of “Arab and international” partners, to keep the peace under the guidance of the United States military, and a “technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee” to run Gaza.

Nusseibeh told me he felt a “paradoxical optimism” after the catastrophe of Gaza, and thought the new temporary government had “a good chance” of not returning to war soon. “We have paid an enormous price,” he told me. “Israelis have too. But that means people will be willing to look at things differently.” Now it was time to lightly chide his former self. “Before, everyone—including me—believed we could have a two-state solution overnight,” he said. Now, he said, no one could fool himself into thinking that peace could be effortlessly maintained, or that statehood could come suddenly. The security framework now coming into focus, he said, might work. And if it does, it could create new possibilities, including in the West Bank. He acknowledged the weirdness of how this path became possible, by the efforts of “this strange guy in the White House” who came from nowhere, “like Superman,” somehow imagining what can be, unburdened by what has been. Previous presidents hadn't done much.

I am not used to being told by Palestinians to cheer up. Nusseibeh expressed concerns, too, particularly that Gaza, although newly peaceful, might end up permanently split from the West Bank. But his contemplation of the possibilities of the current moment was not a daydream.

Trump himself has declared that he “will not allow Israel to annex the West Bank.” That commitment, delivered last month in the Oval Office, was until recently open to doubt, in particular after his appointment of former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, an evangelical supporter of Israel, as his ambassador to Jerusalem. “I think Israel has title deed to Judea and Samaria,” he told CNN in 2017, pointedly preferring the name for the West Bank used by Israeli expansionists. Since he arrived in Jerusalem in April, Huckabee seems to have either lost or found religion on this issue. In July, he visited the West Bank village of Taybeh, where a Palestinian church had been torched by Israeli settlers, and declared that the arson was “an act of terror.” Settler violence surged soon after the October 7 attacks, as I reported at the time. The olive harvest, which has in the past been an occasion for attacks by settlers, just began, and things are quieter now. There may be hope.

Franklin Foer: The existential heroism of the Israeli hostages

The images of devastation in Gaza, and perhaps also the company of a philosopher, reminded me of another philosopher, Jonathan Lear, who died last month. In his 2006 book, Radical Hope, Lear considered what remains for survivors of a wrecked civilization. After the Crow people of America's Great Plains were confined to reservations, their last great chief, Plenty Coups, declared enigmatically that “after this, nothing happened.” The line was an epitaph for a way of life. Lear proposed that pronouncing the Crow dead in one form was a condition for clearing room for the “rebirth” of the Crow in another. To hope radically is to recognize the passing of one way of life, without being able to know what way of life will be born into the space made possible by the passing of the previous one.

The people of Gaza have not suffered a civilizational wipeout like the Crow. (According to Hamas's Ministry of Health, about 3 percent of the population of Gaza has died in the war. The figure includes combatants. In a few short years, about a third of all Crow died of smallpox alone.) But there might be a similar moment coming, when one political era has ended and another, whose details are as yet unknown, is struggling to be born. A strange orange midwife is attending.

It's worth celebrating. But there's reason to fear what it portends.﻿

On Monday, after weeks of nervous anticipation and growing expectations, it finally appeared possible — though not quite guaranteed — that the brutal two-year war in Gaza is over. Hamas freed the 20 living Israeli hostages it was still holding from the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, in exchange for Israel releasing around 1,700 Palestinian prisoners.

The prisoner exchange is the first phase of a 20-point deal proposed by President Donald Trump in September. Trump was in the region on Monday, speaking before Israel's parliament and attending a conference in Egypt on implementation of the agreement, which he hailed as not only the end of the war but as a transformational moment in the history of the Middle East.

Whether that is true remains to be seen.

The success of the deal — to Trump's credit — hinged on his and Arab governments' ability to get Israel and Hamas to agree to the prisoner release and the end of hostilities up front, with thornier long-term issues about the future governance of Gaza, the status of Hamas, and the presence of Israeli troops in the territory still mainly unresolved. The fighting could still resume. Still, the return of the hostages and the halt to the bombing of Gaza allow both Israelis and Palestinians a rare moment of relief and even hope.

But the damage done over the past two years is nearly incalculable.

Over two years of war — launched after Hamas invaded Israel and killed around 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took around 250 more as hostages back to Gaza on October 7, 2023 — Israel has annihilated the Gaza Strip. It has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, starved and displaced most of Gaza's 2 million residents, and reduced most of the territory's buildings and infrastructure to rubble. The fate of the hostages also wrenched Israel's population, driving many of its citizens to join massive protests demanding a deal to end the war and return those kidnapped for more than a year. Globally, Israel's conduct has left its reputation in tatters, its leaders charged with war crimes by the International Criminal Court and isolated on the world stage by nearly all but its closest ally, the United States. The war, and its unpopularity abroad, led Israel's former allies Britain, France, Canada, Australia, Portugal, and Belgium to recognize Palestinian statehood at last month's U.N. General Assembly.

This is not a deal that Netanyahu's government would have agreed to on its own. Indeed, he reportedly had to be strong-armed pretty aggressively by Trump into agreeing to it.

And yet, it's about as close to an absolute victory for Israel as was conceivable over the past two years. If the deal actually being implemented resembles at all what was first announced by Trump at the beginning of this month, Israel will keep a troop presence in Gaza and the capability to periodically launch future strikes against militants there. Hamas will not control Gaza nor — for the foreseeable future — will the Palestinian Authority. It seems very likely that outside actors, not Israel, will be on the hook to pay for the rebuilding of Gaza. The seemingly impossible dilemmas faced by the Netanyahu government turned out not to be dilemmas at all.

Lessons will be taken from this, by both Israel and the rest of the world. The scale and totality of its operation, and their seeming success in achieving nearly all of the war's goals, could lead the nation, and other militaries, to some very grim conclusions about how to best combat internal threats from militant groups like Hamas in the future.

It was clear from the very start that given the horrors of October 7, this was going to be a different sort of war than the ones — costly for Gaza's civilians but limited in scope and duration — that Israel fought in the territory in 2006, 2008, and 2014. The days of “mowing the grass” — degrading Hamas's capabilities without getting embroiled in a long and costly struggle to wipe the group out entirely — were clearly over.

If Israel was going to try to put an end to Hamas entirely, international observers had suggestions. David Petraeus, former commander of US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, wrote in 2024, that Israel was repeating America's post-9/11 mistakes by going to war in Gaza without a plan for a post-war governance structure for the enclave. But, he suggested, Israel should learn from the relative success of the counterinsurgency tactics the US employed in Iraq after 2007.

“Killing and capturing terrorists and insurgents is insufficient,” Petraeus wrote in Foreign Affairs. “[T]he key to solidifying security gains and stemming the recruitment of new adversaries is holding territory, protecting civilians, and providing governance and services to them.”

This is plainly not what Israel did. Commanders weakened safeguards meant to protect noncombatants. According to some reports, more than 80 percent of those killed in Gaza may have been civilians, far higher than in other recent conflicts. More than 70 percent of Gaza's buildings were leveled. Food aid was, at times, blocked entirely.

Israel was continually criticized throughout the war, particularly by Joe Biden's administration, for not having a post-war governance plan for Gaza. But in the end, it simply fought on until one was devised by outside actors, particularly the US, that it found more acceptable than previous plans.

It seems likely that the Gaza War is going to deal a significant blow to the idea of “counterinsurgency” doctrine: that the best way to deal with an insurgency is to win over the local population — to “clear, hold, and build” your way to victory. Israelis might point out that while the 466 soldiers they lost in combat is a very high number compared to other Israeli wars, it's about half of America's losses in the first year of Petraeus's “surge” in Iraq.

Israel fought a war so brutal it was found to have committed genocide by a UN commission and leading international scholars; its prime minister is under indictment by the International Criminal Court. And yet, it ends the war, mostly on its own terms, in a deal touted as a “GREAT DAY” by the president of the United States and fully endorsed by Arab governments.

In short, Israel's overwhelming-force strategy — practically the antithesis of Petraeus's philosophy — was largely successful in the cold terms of achieving its goals. But of course, there are caveats. Israel has deepened its political isolation, and while some of that may fade once the war ends, some of it won't. As Yaroslav Trofimov of the Wall Street Journal writes, increasingly, “solidarity with the Palestinian cause—and hostility to Zionism—have become the political markers of a new generation.” The full extent of the consequences for Israel may not be evident for years. Israel's relationship with the United States is also an exception to the norm: to put it plainly, there aren't many countries that could fight this way and continue to receive billions of dollars per year in military aid. Regardless of Hamas's ultimate fate, it's hard to imagine many Gazans have a more positive attitude toward Israel at the end of this war than at the start of it. It's not hard to imagine a new armed resistance movement emerging and carrying out future attacks on Israel.

And yet, other countries are likely to take the lesson that crushing the enemy is worth the international opprobrium that comes with significant civilian casualties. As a number of commentators put it when discussing US and Israeli strikes on Iran, former US Secretary of State Colin Powell's “Pottery Barn rule,” that when it comes to using military force, “if you break it, you own it,” seems to no longer apply. When it comes to crushing a counterinsurgency, you don't have to “clear, hold, build.” You can just crush.

This feels like yet another indication that we have moved on from the norms of the post-9/11 “war on terror” era — but not to a more humane or lawful form of warfare. Instead, Gaza may perhaps come to be seen as the first counterinsurgency war of the post-“liberal international order” era — an era in which global institutions are weaker and norms around the laws of war, democracy, and human rights are withering.

The coming days will tell whether this is just a hostage exchange and prelude to a new phase of the conflict, or a lasting peace. If it's the latter, it will be welcome relief for Palestinians and allow opportunity for more desperately needed aid to enter Gaza, and for the residents to start to rebuild. Israel will have to reckon with the failures, military and political, that led to the October 7 attacks as it heads into what could be a closely fought national election next year.

But the true legacy of this conflict is likely to become clear only when those future wars break out. When questioned about the way they conduct those wars, governments are likely to point to Israel's example.

Business Insider Edition 

Madagascar's administration, which has in recent weeks come under heavy fire, recently spoke about an attempted coup, as the youth-led protest in the country continues to gain ground.


        Over the weekend, members of the country's army joined a protest that is calling for the resignation of the president of the country, Andry Rajoelina.
    


        This has led the presidency to speculate on a potential coup, after a military unit referred to as CAPSAT instructed its troops to disregard any orders from the government and support the protesters.
    


        The CAPSAT unit had been responsible for aiding the current president in seizing power in a 2009 coup.
    


        According to CAPSAT officials, who are based on the outskirts of Antananarivo, the country's capital, they have command over all security activities and will coordinate all military branches.
    


        As reported by Reuters, General Demosthene Pikulas, who had previously served as head of the military academy, was named army chief.
    


        Another unit within the country's paramilitary gendarmerie, which had, prior to Sunday, assisted the police in tackling the protests, had also followed in CAPSAT's footsteps, deciding to disregard government instructions.
    


        ""All use of force and any improper behaviour towards our fellow citizens are prohibited, as the gendarmerie is a force meant to protect people and not to defend the interests of a few individuals,"" the Intervention Forces of the National Gendarmerie said in a statement broadcast on Real TV.
    


        A little over a week ago, Protests in Madagascar's capital, Antananarivo, came to a halt after demonstrators in the region decided to recoup.
    


        The protests against the government's leadership have now resumed in full force, with their intensity continuing to escalate.
    


        Madagascar has been ravaged by weeks of protests that began over water and electricity shortages but have since escalated into a severe political crisis.
    


        The unrest began on September 25, 2025, in Antananarivo, the capital, when inhabitants, especially young people, came to the streets to protest chronic power outages and deplorable living conditions.
    


        As dissatisfaction with poverty, corruption, and unemployment grew, the demonstrations, dubbed the Gen Z movement, swiftly spread to neighboring cities.

        To ease tensions, President Andry Rajoelina dismissed his administration on September 29 and named General Ruphin Fortunat Zafisambo as prime minister on October 6.
    


        However, demonstrators rejected the decision, claiming that it did not address their concerns.
    


        Since the protests began, reports indicate that at least 22 people have been killed, and over 100 have been injured. A curfew has been imposed in numerous towns, and some international flights, including Air France, have been suspended owing to security concerns.
    


        Protesters continue to call for the president's resignation and improved government services.
    


        Meanwhile, the African Union and the United Nations have urged calm and negotiation, but the crisis has not been resolved.

Tiffany Ng, a 24-year-old tech and culture writer based in New York, was too attached to her iPhone, so she did what humans do when trying to tame an unruly beast.

She chained it to a wall.

Ng felt she was spending too much time staring at her little screen and wanted an escape. Turns out she's in good company. Over 40% of American adults — and 62% of those under 30 — say they are on their phones ""almost constantly,"" according to a Pew Research survey conducted in late 2023. Most Americans, including 81% of adults under 30, believe they use their phone too much, a 2022 Gallup survey found.

Ng's desire to turn the supercomputer in her pocket into a makeshift landline is also one that's shared by other zoomers and millennials. Some Americans are going full Luddite, giving up smartphones altogether in favor of so-called dumb phones, while some parents are easing their kids into technology by opting for classic landlines instead of iPhones.

There are also plenty of people who want a break from their screens but aren't quite ready or able to ditch the conveniences of modern technology altogether. So instead of giving up their smartphones, some young people are creating setups that mimic landlines — by chaining their phone to the wall or creating a wall mount to ""hang up the phone"" rather than carry it with them all the time.

Yalda Uhls, a research psychologist and the founding CEO of the Center for Scholars and Storytellers at UCLA, said studies have shown that creating physical distance between yourself and your phone can make a big difference.

One study measured how participants completed tasks when they had their phones face down on their desk, in their pocket or a nearby bag, or in another room. The people who had their phones in another room performed the best.

""If you can see your phone, if you can grab it and walk around with it, you're going to want to do that,"" she told Business Insider. ""If it's separate from you, that's the only time people stop really thinking about their phone.""

Business Insider talked to three young adults who said creating a physical boundary around their phone has drastically improved their screen time and their quality of life.

Maddie DeVico, a 31-year-old who works in sales for a software company in Denver, said she was feeling overwhelmed by her reliance on technology and trapped by the constant need to respond to messages quickly.

She romanticized the landline she had during her childhood in New Jersey and became obsessed with the idea of getting back to ""hanging up the phone"" — turning her device into something that she set down at the end of the workday rather than carry with her constantly.

So she took some leftover clay and made her own phone docking station. She hung it on her wall near her kitchen and started setting her phone there at the end of the workday. Initially, she noticed she would go back to it and pick it up to scroll, but after a brief transition period, she found herself setting it down and not picking it up the rest of the night.

""Once I started doing that, putting my phone away, I just stopped reaching for it all the time,"" DeVico said. ""And I just noticed this mental freeness that came with disconnecting. It was kind of a crazy shift.""

She said her screen time went down by three hours each day. Her friends learned that they were no longer going to get an immediate text back from her, and she even started leaving the phone in its dock when she left the house. She suddenly had more time to do other things, like cooking and crafting. She started spending more time in her garden just looking at bugs.

""I was so shocked with the amount of stress that left my body. It was life-changing in a way because I ran a little anxious before I started this habit,"" she said.

When her friends come over for dinner, she also has them keep their phones away from the table, and as a result, she said they're having more meaningful discussions about personal topics. After she posted about the phone dock on TikTok, she racked up nearly a million views and heard from hundreds of others about how they, too, are trying to bring back hanging up the phone.

""I think we're just really genuinely trying to go back to living simpler without the chaos and without all the distractions,"" she said.

Uhls, the UCLA researcher who often works with members of Gen Z and Gen Alpha, said young people are acutely aware of how much time they spend on their phones, and often make efforts to spend less time on them. She said even though they spend a lot of time on social media, they recognize that it's not particularly deep or fulfilling.

""They're craving connections and craving more meaningful experiences,"" she said.

Some Gen Zers are so desperate for connection that they've embraced the Luddite movement. At an anti-technology rally in New York City last month, dozens of young people put Apple on a mock trial and smashed iPhones. Others are embracing ""appstinence,"" a term coined by a 24-year-old grad student at Harvard.

Chaining her phone to a wall was one of several experiments Ng has done as part of her newsletter, Cyber Celibate, which she uses to explore our relationship with technology. She's also printed out her TikTok ""For You"" page to read like a newspaper and sent carrier pigeons instead of texts.

For the chain to the wall experiment, Ng gave her phone a full charge, unplugged it, and then put it on its leash by making creative use of a chain link belt. She was committed to leaving it there, even when she left the house, and not giving it another charge for a full week. She put a bench in front of it, where she could sit when she needed to use her phone, but that wasn't comfy enough to make an endless scroll session appealing.

The first couple of days, Ng said she would look forward to going home and being able to scroll on her phone. But when she finally opened her special media feed, that excitement was met with the ""very anti-climactic experience of looking at pictures of Alix Earle,"" an influencer.

""The almost religious experience of being on your phone kind of loses its aura,"" she said. ""It's very alluring, but it's not satisfying at all.""

One of the most surprising things she found was how ""out of sight, out of mind"" her phone really was. When she met up with friends in the park, worked from a coffee shop, or even just during her commute, she didn't find herself reaching for her phone the way she expected to. Instead, she started to notice her surroundings — like the buildings around the train station she frequents or how people act differently on the L train versus the 2.

""I don't want to sound overdramatic, but toward the end, it really felt like I was reentering real life in a way,"" Ng said.

Ng said she thinks Gen Z is pining for simpler technology and simpler times (she recently was delighted to learn what dial-up internet was). While the experiment lasted a week, she still continues to actively leave her phone in another room, or even leave it behind when she gets out of the house, somewhere close by.

Not everyone romanticizing the days of the landline is against modern technology.

Catherine Goetze is the creator of CatGPT, an online media brand focused on AI education. The millennial content creator worked in tech before amassing hundreds of thousands of followers with helpful videos intended to make AI more accessible.

But Goetze also had a desire to be reachable without being tethered to her smartphone. So a couple of years ago, she bought an old rotary phone and some special parts and turned it into a Bluetooth device connected to her cellphone.

When someone called her cellphone, her ""landline"" rang, so she could be alerted to incoming calls without also having to be open to every other potential phone notification. She could also make calls by simply picking up the phone and dialing. She even made it so that when she dialed star, it would activate Siri, and she could direct it to call contacts by name, eliminating the need to memorize or look up a number.

This summer, when she posted a video showing off the landline phone she'd been using for years, her comments were full of people saying they needed one too. That's how Goetze decided to start Physical Phones, which makes and sells Bluetooth phones like the one she herself uses.

""It is not realistic to throw your smartphone into a river,"" Goetze said, adding, ""The Physical Phone says, 'Look, keep your iPhone. But there are still ways that you can regain some level of balance and intentionality about achieving that balance.""

The phones are currently available for presale and expected to start shipping in November or December, but early signs are encouraging. Goetze said when they first launched, they generated $118,000 in pre-sales in 72 hours.

She said she thinks the orders are from a mix of millennials who are nostalgic for the landlines of their past, and zoomers who don't remember having a landline but are just as nostalgic and apt to romanticize that time, as evidenced by the resurgence in shows like ""Friends"" and Y2K fashion.

Goetze said she doesn't think most people want to live in a world without modern technology, but rather one where they are using that technology mindfully, rather than being used by it.

Two dozen eggs, a gallon of milk, 30 rolls of toilet paper — and one ounce of 24 karat gold.

While that might be one of the more expensive grocery runs a Costco shopper might make, it is one that could realistically happen.

Costco sells hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of gold and silver each month. There are two ways to buy bars and coins from the wholesale club: online and in-store at certain warehouses. Here's what that looks like.

The first step — step zero, if you will — is to get a Costco membership, since precious metals are exclusively available to members. The basic Gold Star membership gives you access, but if you're planning to spend several thousand dollars on gold and silver, it might make sense to spring for the executive upgrade.

For the additional $65, executive members get 2% rewards on most purchases, including precious metals. At the current price of around $4,100, the reward on a one-ounce gold bar or coin would be $82, which is more than the price of an upgrade. (Executive members can also shop early at the warehouse, but that's another story.)

Equipped with a membership, the options to buy precious metals depend largely on the availability of supply.

Gold, silver, and platinum are listed on Costco.com on a precious metals page in the jewelry and watches category. (The items were previously listed under sports memorabilia and collectibles, which made them a bit harder for the casual buyer to track down.)

When products are priced at or near the commodity market's ""spot"" price, they can sell out extremely quickly. At one point on October 13, a one-ounce gold bar from the Canadian Mint was available through Costco's website for $4,120, below the spot price at the time. The Costco price for the one-ounce gold bar has since gone up.

Silver also tends to sell out quickly and follows a similar pricing pattern. In fact, silver's market rally of nearly 80% this year so far has outpaced gold's 56% increase. Plus, silver's lower unit price — it's at an all-time high of $52 per ounce — means more options for shoppers who are curious about buying metals but don't want to fork over the price of a well-used car just yet.

Costco has responded to fluctuations in demand by limiting the quantities of a particular item a member is allowed to purchase in one transaction and over a 24-hour period.

Once an online purchase is completed, Costco estimates about three to five days for delivery, typically via UPS or FedEx. Same-day grocery orders must be placed separately, via Instacart.

Comments on the CostcoPM subreddit indicate that some packages can take longer to deliver, especially around periods of high demand and near the end of the week.

Precious metals are also occasionally available at some warehouses — if you know where to look.

Sometimes it's easier to spot: the store will put a large sign near the entrance encouraging arriving shoppers to check out seasonal or specialty bars. Some stores will let you know what they have in stock if you call ahead.

At other times, a sample of the available inventory will be displayed in the warehouse's jewelry case near the electronics section.

Still, it's not as simple as tossing a bar into your cart and proceeding to checkout. The jewelry case also has a stack of paper forms that shoppers must fill out with the item SKU and quantity they wish to purchase.

Shoppers then bring the completed slip to the front office, where an employee will retrieve the order and assist with payment. Voila — they now own a small slab of expensive metal. Don't lose it.

There are three last things Costco shoppers should note.

Although Costco stands behind everything it sells, precious metals are excluded from the company's unusually generous return policy. It also will not adjust the price of gold, silver, or platinum after purchase. Once the deal is done, that's it.

The second thing is that it generally does not make mathematical sense to finance gold or silver purchases with credit card debt or other interest-bearing payment options.

While some metals buyers use credit cards in order to take advantage of rewards schemes, it's widely understood that any balance should be promptly paid off with cash, since interest charges can offset any card points or increase in the metal's value.

Lastly, some gold and silver buyers have found that selling metals can be harder than buying them (at least at the prices they would prefer). Coin shops are not likely to offer the full spot price for gold or silver, since they need to leave room to make a profit when they sell the metal.

Metals dealers and advisors generally recommend planning to hold onto physical precious metals for the long term. Selling without a strategy can have unexpected costs.

The last time I boarded the HMS Prince of Wales, the sailors kept talking about the food.

""It's pretty good,"" said a Merlin HM2 operator on the captain's bridge, as I sheltered with a group of British experts from the unrelenting Singapore sun in June.

His two squadron mates, tasked with guiding us through the aircraft carrier, eagerly took us through a full list of what they eat every day.

Sailors and air wing crew regularly get steak and whole fish, and these three said they never had a complaint. During other segments of my visit, other crew members mentioned favorite meals: curries, lamb, and fish and chips.

It's rare to hear troops so readily praise the food on deployment. So when the Prince of Wales, the UK's newest aircraft carrier, returned to Singapore in late September, the Royal Navy allowed me into the 16-deck marine giant's catering facilities for a closer look.

It was a quiet Wednesday for the kitchens as some chefs took time off in the city. The carrier strike group, halfway through an eight-month deployment in the Indo-Pacific, was departing soon. Most of the carrier's 1,600 personnel were expected to eat on board as pilots and sailors filtered in from port leave.

The deployment is a high-profile operation for the UK, which is hoping to show the region a strong front after its Queen Elizabeth-class carriers suffered repeated technical failures in recent years.

For operational security reasons, I was only cleared to view and photograph the dining and cooking areas. The RN also requested that interviewees not be identified by their last names.

The Prince of Wales' weekly menu includes a Wednesday theme night, such as Scottish or Mexican, fish on Fridays, steak on Saturdays, and a Sunday roast dinner.

These special meals aren't specific to the Prince of Wales and are intended to be standard across the RN.

Petty Officer Craig ""Jacko,"" one of eight senior-ranking staff overseeing the galleys, said the carrier's kitchens have an especially strong reputation among the crew.

He cited the military adage ""food is morale"" as he took me through the fore galley.

Inside, RN chefs were wrapping up lunch and starting on dinner prep. With only about two-thirds of a typical shift cooking at port, the air-conditioned galley seemed sleepier than usual.

Still, the cooks work fast and at scale. The steaming scent of salmon and roast potatoes gushed from 12 combination ovens while young chefs chopped red onions and chicken by the crateload. To haul ingredients from freezers and storerooms on other decks, chefs use twin elevators that feed into the kitchen.

""What's different here is the numbers,"" said Jacko, standing next to frothing vats of penne and meat sauce. ""Cooking for 1,600 people, it's a lot busier. We're talking about 200 kilos of meat a day.""

Menus are the same for officers and crew, who all get breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a midnight meal. When in a heightened alert posture, the Prince of Wales offers two breakfasts — à la Lord of the Rings — with one beginning at 4:30 a.m.

On a typical day, the crew has four to five options per meal, totaling roughly 20 to 25 types of mains a day.

Lunch on the Thursday before I visited, for example, was currywurst and onions, Philly cheesesteaks, peri-peri chicken, cheese and veggie baguettes, and jacket potatoes, salads, cold meats, fruit, and a soup of the day.

The theme that night was Italian, with oven-baked lasagna, chicken parms, Roman-style roast lamb, spinach and ricotta spaghetti, Parmesan roast potatoes, and focaccia. For dessert, the crew was served tiramisu with cream on the side.

Jacko said galley staff, thousands of miles from home, eventually plan some menus by asking around for cravings.

After five months at sea, a warrant officer said he was pining for ham, eggs, and chips — a UK staple. So, Jacko said, the Prince of Wales served it up for lunch on a Thursday.

""That was big, probably the busiest meal I've seen for a long time,"" he said.

Jacko said the Prince of Wales' food is the top in the RN because there are so many chefs on board.

The carrier has 71 catering staff to feed 1,600 people, with 15 managers and 56 junior rates responsible for cooking roughly 8,000 meals a day.

""Their secondary roles are fewer, so they can do more in the galley,"" he said.

Though the carrier was only running one kitchen while docked in Singapore, it usually operates two main galleys, a 24/7 snack bar for flight crews and pilots, and a private galley for top commanders.

Before dawn, a bakery attached to the fore galley pumps out pizza dough, pie crusts, baguettes, and up to 300 loaves of fresh bread, some of which are flown by helicopter to other warships escorting the Prince of Wales.

Most galleys cook and prep nonstop, and chefs work 12-hour shifts while performing an additional duty every four days.

""It's just a constant bombardment of work,"" Jacko said.

AB1 Ockeem ""Hibby"" is gunning for a promotion. He was put in charge of Wednesday's lunch menu, which included salmon fillets, sausages with onions, palm-sized steak bakes, and crushed potatoes that you could shower with cheese, tuna, and baked beans.

""You have to watch out for dietary requirements, that's the main thing,"" said Hibby, who joined the Prince of Wales' crew in December. ""We have people who eat gluten-free, we have vegetarians, we have vegans.""

Jacko said the sheer number of chefs on the carrier makes it easier to diversify meals on long deployments, since every cook can add their own twist to the menu.

Hibby, of Jamaican descent, oversaw a Jamaican Independence Day dinner for the entire ship in August.

As part of his promotion assessment, Hibby meets with senior staff to discuss kitchen assignments and the menu.

This challenge tests whether cooks are ready to think and plan in large numbers, Jacko said.

""A lot of people come straight from training, and they've gone from cooking for about 100 people to cooking for 1,000 people,"" he said. ""They know exactly what to do and how to do it, but they need more coaching and mentoring on the numbers and quantity.""

Chefs also learn deployment-friendly recipes from navies they visit, like gyros and kebabs from Greece. As the carrier approached Singapore last week, its galleys served Hoi Sin duck breast, glazed tofu, spring rolls, and keropok, or prawn crackers.

To procure ingredients like these, the Prince of Wales resupplies when it docks, facilitated by agents stationed in port countries who work from domestic suppliers. That often means the ship buys whatever it can from the local region.

""Coming out to this side of the world, we've been able to facilitate foods like snapper, shark, kangaroo,"" said Lt. Dan, the ship's deputy logistics officer.

Dan, who goes by his first name on the ship, said the carrier left the UK with frozen foods to spare but usually tops up with meats, milk, and fresh vegetables. While in Singapore, the ship received 11 trucks laden with roughly 30 days' worth of food, including 1,650 pounds of rice, he said.

To keep menus varied, the ship juggles a long list of groceries such as haggis, pork belly, chorizo, ribeye steaks, calamari, ham, and cooking wines. Not everything is available at each port, so balancing the carrier's stores requires supply and catering officers to predict far in advance which areas will run low in each world region.

Planning for the whole deployment started 14 months ago, Dan added.

""Until we get back to the Mediterranean, we probably won't get more sausages,"" he said.

Sailors and air wing crew filed into the junior rates' hall, where everyone eats when the carrier runs a reduced service in port.

Crew generally choose only one meat option, but I ladled myself a salmon fillet and some of that precious sausage, along with potatoes and shredded cheese.

The sausage, chewy and somewhat dry, was a tad too salty, but the salmon was evenly cooked, moist, flaky, and doused in a lightly sweet tomato sauce over rice and peas. While the cheese was nothing to write home about, the crushed spuds were warm and soft.

What struck me was that I'd just been fed a whole baked salmon fillet — an actual one, not a slice of dehydrated pale sponge advertised as a fillet, as one expects from a cookhouse. And this was on a day when the menu was watered down, the sailors told me.

You could certainly find better in a restaurant, but by military standards, this was fare I could look forward to every day. Nearby sailors and officers were polishing off their plates.

Next to me, Lt. Andrew ""Dickie"" was tucking into his potatoes.

A training officer who's served for 21 years and deployed to Bahrain and Iraq on Duke-class frigates, he said the carrier's food beats anything else he's had at sea.

""For the quantity they have on board, the quality is unbelievable. You can tell they're all specialists, they're good at it,"" said Dickie, originally a senior enlisted engineer who commissioned in March 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Though about 20% smaller than the USS Gerald R. Ford, the British warship has less than half of the American supercarrier's 4,500-odd crew and can house more amenities on board.

Space is still tight, but the Prince of Wales sports ice baths, saunas, inflatable swimming pools, a café, a golf simulator, three gyms, karaoke, and even a PC gaming suite.

Instead of 40-person berthing rooms, the ship puts junior sailors in cabins that fit eight bunks. And when not on alert, the crew gets a daily allowance of two 12-oz beers or equivalent servings of alcohol.

Dan, the logistics officer, said the Prince of Wales has experimented with ways to conserve food, such as healthy days or meat-free days. Pushback from the crew was fierce, he recalled.

""Ultimately, with the work they do, three times a day, they just want to come in and have some food and home comfort,"" he said. ""There's no sense trying to change that.""

Amazon Web Services has hired Chet Kapoor, the former CEO of DataStax, as its new vice president of security services and observability, according to an internal email obtained by Business Insider.

Kapoor will report directly to AWS CEO Matt Garman, who announced the move in a companywide email on Monday. Kapoor will work alongside AWS CISO Amy Herzog. An AWS spokesperson confirmed the appointment.

Garman said Kapoor will lead efforts to strengthen AWS's security offerings as the company expands its AI business. The hire underscores AWS's push to tighten security around its AI products.

At DataStax, Kapoor oversaw Astra DB, a database built on the open-source Apache Cassandra project, and spearheaded its integration with real-time AI capabilities, Garman said in the email.

The move marks the latest leadership change at AWS. In the past year, the company has lost some executives, including VP of AI Matt Wood and VP of generative AI Vasi Philomin, while adding others, such as former Microsoft exec Julia White as marketing chief.

Electric vehicle sales in the US reached a new milestone in the third quarter of 2025. Beyond that, the future is uncertain for almost every player in this market, except one.

With federal incentives for EVs falling away, the US market must survive on its own merits. Who wins and who survives will depend largely on who has the scale and sales volume to make their businesses profitable.

Tesla has already reached scale and is comfortably profitable. Most other operators in the US EV market aren't there yet.

""In the volume-driven business of automotive manufacturing, low volume is the enemy; EV profitability remains a distant dream for nearly every automaker,"" Cox Automotive, an industry data provider, warned recently in its latest EV market report.

A record 437,487 EVs were sold in the US in the third quarter, according to estimates from Cox's Kelley Blue Book. That marks a 30% year-over-year surge this quarter, underscoring the growing mainstream appeal of EVs.

Yet beneath the headline growth lies a harsh economic truth: without massive scale, most automakers are still losing money on their electric ambitions in the US.

Tesla remains the exception. Even as its market share slipped to 41% from 49% the previous year, it continues to dominate the US EV landscape. The Model Y and Model 3 alone accounted for more than 168,000 units sold in the third quarter, dwarfing competitors.

By contrast, only nine out of roughly 90 EV models sold more than 10,000 units in the US in the quarter. Most electric vehicles struggle to move more than 6,000 units a quarter, according to Cox data. That volume is probably too low to achieve economies of scale in manufacturing, supply chains, and software integration.

Major brands, including Mercedes, Toyota, and Nissan, saw flat or declining EV sales in the third quarter, despite consumers rushing to purchase ahead of incentives expiring on September 30.

Meanwhile, Volkswagen, General Motors, Honda, and Hyundai posted robust growth. While a promising sign, that may not be enough volume to turn their EV operations in the US into profitable businesses.

For instance, Ford's EV division lost $2.2 billion in the first half of 2025, despite an increase in sales. Rivian lost about $1.7 billion in the same period. In contrast, Tesla reported a profit of more than $1.5 billion in the first half of this year.  

It's no wonder that many legacy carmakers are backtracking on their EV plans. If they cannot reach a high-volume scale, they risk consistently losing money. At some point, they have to stop the bleeding.

In July, Mercedes stopped taking EV orders in the US. Stellantis has recently shelved some of its EV plans, along with Porsche and Honda. Even Ferrari, which has juicy profit margins, dialed down its EV plans.

With federal EV incentives now gone, analysts at Cox Automotive expect sales to decline in the fourth quarter and early 2026, testing whether the US market can sustain itself without government support.

This could reveal which carmakers have the stamina to suck up EV losses and try to reach scale in the US market. Tesla is already there. Very few other companies are even close.

""The training wheels are coming off,"" said Cox Automotive's director of industry insights Stephanie Valdez Streaty.

The next phase will reveal whether automakers can drive America's EV market on fundamentals — cost efficiency, scale, and innovation — rather than incentives.

For now, Tesla stands alone as proof that, in this industry, volume equals survival.

The tech industry boarded the AI ""crazy train"" this summer, and it shows no signs of slowing down.

The latest fuel for this boom comes from Wall Street. Some of these projects are now being financed by elaborate borrowing methods and unusual, circular deals.

In these moments, I lean on Dakin Campbell, a BI reporter who's covered Wall Street for almost two decades. He wrote a great story about this AI financing frenzy, so I asked him to weigh in here:

Alistair Barr: Structured credit is showing up in AI infrastructure financing. Does that worry you?

Dakin Campbell: The easy answer is we have seen this movie before. Structured credit isn't fundamentally dangerous. But it does distribute risk throughout the system in a way that makes it harder to see and track and understand. And yes, that does worry me. It makes the job harder for investors, regulators, journalists, and others who act as a natural counterbalance against excess.

Do founders such as Mark Zuckerberg and Sam Altman care about investors' return on investment, or just winning the AI race?

At some level, I do believe that Zuckerberg and Altman and others believe that there is money to be made. They think it will become a profitable, a very profitable business, at some point in the future. I do think their egos are involved in the belief that they could be the ones to usher in AGI and become the legends of history. These are men who read science fiction books when they were kids. I don't think we can overlook that aspect.

Are railroads a fair analogy for the AI buildout — big losses at first, lasting assets later?

Railroad tracks and locomotives are long-lived assets, whereas that is not true of GPUs.

Tech blogger Paul Kedrosky, who I quoted in my piece, says about 60% of the cost of data centers is the GPUs. You can argue whether their depreciable life is three years or six years, but whatever that is, it is considerably shorter than railroad assets. There is of course the shell of the data center and the cooling and electrical infrastructure for the building but if Kedrosky is right, that means less than half of the spending is going into an asset that could reasonably be considered long dated infrastructure, like the railroads.

The analogy to fiber overbuilding in the first dot-com boom is also instructive. Fiber networks last longer than GPUs.

Can inference demand sustain this AI infrastructure boom, or will it depend on real-world AI products?

Inference is the process of getting AI models to deliver answers for users, which one would argue is the same goal as real-world end products.

At some point, the industry will need to figure out how to design products with repeatable outcomes, based on AI that they can sell to corporations and consumers. You're already seeing people arguing that we should stop reaching for AGI or superintelligence and instead focus on using AI, today, to solve real-world problems. And you hear from smart AI researchers who say we are still several advancements from achieving AGI.

So when I think about it like that, yes, at some point, it feels like the markets or investors or public perception will force these companies and these CEOs to focus less on AGI and more on solving real-world problems.

Have you personally seen any real value from generative AI?

Yes, I have. I have friends who love Grammarly for helping to improve and copy edit their writing. I like asking other models research questions, which I find helpful for ideation and my own thinking.

But when I ask it to solve problems for me in a repeatable fashion, or to look at a pile of documents and come up with an answer that strictly adheres to the information in the documents, it fails pretty miserably.

So I do see the potential, and I am not sitting here calling this all nonsense, but when I talk to people about AI, the answer I get back again and again is that they would like AI to be able to help them solve problems easily and repeatably, without having to know the exact words to use in the prompt. It doesn't feel like we're there yet.

Strategy Inc., the Bitcoin treasury company founded by Michael Saylor, bought the digital currency for the first time since it reached a record high earlier this month, raising its holdings to over $73 billion after months of tapering off its purchases. 

The firm, formerly known as MicroStrategy Inc. has long been considered a bellwether for crypto sentiment, as it grew to become the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. But as skepticism over the crypto treasury model rose, Strategy's stock price has lagged behind Bitcoin as it rallied to a record price of $126,000 this month.

Bitcoin's modest recovery after Friday's record crypto crash has done little to ease the fallout from over $20 billion purge of leveraged bets that left parts of the market incapacitated. The unprecedented washout erased months of speculative build-up and forced some funds out entirely, traders say.

Open interest in Bitcoin futures dropped to about $70 billion from roughly $94 billion across major exchanges, data compiled by Coinglass show — the steepest single-day fall in more than two years. The sharp contraction underscores how quickly risk can unwind in a market still governed by automatic margin calls and fragmented liquidity.

As Salesforce welcomes tens of thousands of people to San Francisco for its annual Dreamforce conference, CEO Marc Benioff has found himself in the center of local controversy on a national issue.

In an interview with The New York Times published on Friday, Benioff appeared eager for President Donald Trump to send federal troops to his company's hometown, inserting himself into a national debate about whether the president should call the National Guard into various Democrat-led cities that Trump has maligned.

The Trump administration recently deployed the National Guard to Portland and Chicago, sparking protests and lawsuits.

""We don't have enough cops, so if they can be cops, I'm all for it,"" Benioff told the Times.

Benioff subsequently softened his comments, writing on X on Sunday that safety is ""first and foremost, the responsibility of our city and state leaders."" But a heated online conversation was already well underway.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who moved to Texas from California, said federal intervention is needed to deal with crime in San Francisco. In posts on his social network X on Sunday, he said it would be ""the only solution at this point,"" and that ""nothing else has or will work."" A day earlier, Musk, who has drawn criticism for his own drug use, characterized downtown San Francisco as a ""drug zombie apocalypse.""

Musk still has big business in and around San Francisco. His artificial intelligence startup xAI, which owns X, has a sizable office in the city, and his brain computer interface company, Neuralink, recently leased a large property in South San Francisco. Tesla relocated to Texas, but the automaker's engineering headquarters remains in Palo Alto, just south of San Francisco.

Musk's call for U.S. troops came in response to social media posts by Tom Wolf, who describes himself as a ""a formerly homeless recovering addict in San Francisco,"" and an ""advocate for addiction recovery.""

""If you want to keep federal troops out of San Francisco, remove the organized drug dealers and 80% of the problem goes away,"" Wolf wrote. ""If you don't, you reap what you sow.""

Musk shared Wolf's post to his more than 227 million listed followers on X.

Neither Benioff nor Musk immediately responded to requests for comment. CNBC also reached out to Tesla, xAI and Salesforce for comment but did not hear back.

Local officials loudly opposed the idea of bringing in federal troops.

Brooke Jenkins, San Francisco's district attorney, wrote on X after the Benioff interview that, ""I can't be silent any longer.""

Jenkins accused Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem of turning ""so-called public safety and immigration enforcement into a form of government sponsored violence against U.S. citizens, families, and ethnic groups,"" and said that if anyone is using excessive force or illegally harassing residents, ""I will not hesitate to do my job and hold you accountable just like I do other violators of the law every single day.""

San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie, who defeated incumbent London Breed in November in part by promising to clean up San Francisco's streets, wrote on X on Sunday that ""crime is down 30% and tent encampments are at an all-time low."" He didn't directly address Benioff or Dreamforce, but noted that tens of thousand of people are coming to the city for activities including concerts and Fleet Week, and that public safety is critical.

""San Francisco is on the rise,"" he wrote

In Benioff's follow-up comments after his interview with the Times, the Salesforce CEO praised Lurie's efforts to increase police hiring and retain law enforcement.

Dreamforce, which launched in 2003, kicks off on Tuesday and runs through Thursday. The event is being held at the Moscone Center and occupies much of the surrounding area in downtown San Francisco.

Garry Tan, CEO of startup incubator Y Combinator, wrote on X that ""We don't need the National Guard,"" but he used his post to go after a frequent local target for techies: Chesa Boudin and progressives.

Boudin was district attorney in San Francisco until 2022, when he was removed in a recall election after critics railed against what they viewed as his unwillingness to prosecute violent criminals. Now the judges are the problem, Tan said.

""We need new judges who are not hardcore Chesa Boudin-style activists who work to keep drug dealers out of jail even though the police, the district attorney and the people of SF want them locked up,"" he wrote. ""It's shockingly that simple in SF.""

Stock futures were little changed on Monday night, following a winning session in which the major averages recovered a chunk of their losses suffered at the end of last week.

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures ticked higher by just 36 points. S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures hovered just above the flatline.

The S&P 500 and Dow each jumped more than 1% on the day, marking the former's biggest one-day gain since May 27. The broad market index also clawed back more than half of Friday's steep decline. The Dow had its best day since Sept. 11, broke a five-day losing streak and recovered two-thirds of Friday's losses.

The moves came after a Truth Social post from President Donald Trump eased investor worries about growing trade tensions between China and the U.S. ""Don't worry about China, it will all be fine,"" Trump's Sunday post said.

That sent tech stocks such as Oracle, AMD and Nvidia up broadly, leading the market higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq notched a more than 2% gain.

""Trade policy remains a key driver for US financial markets this year, and last week saw a sharp re-escalation in tensions between the US and China,"" Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, global head of equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note. ""With hardened positions on both sides, we expect increased equity market volatility into the end of the month. However, the history of Trump-Xi negotiations suggests that escalation is often followed by tactical truces, and rare earth minerals versus shipping fees could ultimately seal a deal.""

Investors on Tuesday will look to keep this momentum going, as major banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs are set to report third-quarter earnings.

Friday's sell-off may have had silver lining: it may have delayed the bull market peak, according to Leuthold Group chief investment officer Doug Ramsey. 

""If this cycle is fated to end with anything loosely resembling a traditional topping process, then the eventual bull market peak has been pushed out at least a couple more months. In our case, though, high valuations and escalating risks to the U.S. economy stymie any desire to more aggressively play the bull's final innings,"" Ramsey wrote to clients Monday. 

Still, Ramsey noted he sees troubling trends in this market, including a recently steep drop in S&P 500 cyclical stocks relative to defensive names. ""Such action is troubling; although, our best guess is that the final bull market peak will not occur until the warnings from our traditional bellwethers have become more pronounced.""

Goldman Sachs announced Monday that it agreed to acquire Industry Ventures, a venture capital firm with $7 billion in assets under supervision, according to a release from the investment bank. The bank will pay $665 million in cash for Industry Ventures and up to an additional $300 million based on the firm's performance through 2030.

""Industry Ventures' trusted relationships and venture capital expertise complement our existing investing franchises and expand opportunities for clients to access the fastest growing companies and sectors in the world,"" CEO David Solomon said in the release.

Goldman Sachs has agreed to acquire Industry Ventures, a venture capital firm with $7 billion in assets under supervision, according to a release from the investment bank.

Goldman is paying $665 million in cash and equity, and up to $300 million more based on the firm's future performance through 2030, the bank said. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026.

Goldman Sachs is making the acquisition to bolster its $540 billion alternatives investment platform, part of the self-identified ""growth engine"" of the investment bank. By identifying and making bets on startups, the venture capital firm can help Goldman create a pipeline of investments for its wealthy clients, as well as provide solutions to tech entrepreneurs.

San Francisco-based Industry Ventures has helped pioneer aspects of the American VC market since its founding 25 years ago, according to Goldman CEO David Solomon.

""Industry Ventures' trusted relationships and venture capital expertise complement our existing investing franchises and expand opportunities for clients to access the fastest growing companies and sectors in the world,"" Solomon said in the release.

""By combining the global resources of Goldman Sachs with the venture capital expertise of Industry Ventures, we are uniquely positioned to serve the increasingly complex needs of entrepreneurs, private technology companies, limited partners, and venture fund managers,"" said Hans Swildens, founder and CEO of Industry Ventures.

Industry Ventures has made more than 1,000 investments and said its annual performance was an internal rate of return of 18%.

The bank said it expects that all 45 employees of the venture firm will join Goldman.

Monday - Friday, 6:00 - 7:00 PM ET

Broadcom CEO Hock Tan told CNBC's Jim Cramer on Monday that artificial intelligence could become a larger part of global GDP as the technology spreads across industries.

Tan said the current global GDP sits around $110 trillion, with 30% of that figure ""valued from industries related to knowledge-based, technology-intensive.""

""And you put in generative AI, you create intelligence in a lot of other aspects of society,"" Tan continued. ""That 30% say will grow to 40% of all GDP. That's $10 trillion a year.""

If AI grows and becomes responsible for a larger piece of global GDP as Tan predicts, it would be a boon to the nascent tech sector and all the industries it relies on. Broadcom makes chips and networking equipment and has been a huge beneficiary of the AI boom as hyperscalers buy up its products. The stock is currently up 53.86%.

Broadcom and OpenAI announced their official partnership on Monday, saying they would jointly build and deploy 10 gigawatts of custom artificial intelligence accelerators. The move is part of a broader effort to scale AI across the industry. Broadcom shares surged in response to the news, up 9.88% by market close.

Broadcom and OpenAI's deal is the latest in a slew of pricey partnerships among key Big Tech players related to AI.

Tan said OpenAI is ""one of those few players in the forefront of creating foundation models,"" and noted that even as a private company, the ChatGPT maker is worth about $500 billion. According to Tan, Broadcom's ""hard-nosed"" approach to business doesn't keep the company from looking several years in the future ""at this phenomenon, this wave called generative AI.""

Broadcom is tight-lipped about its customers, but said earlier this year it was developing new AI chips with three large cloud customers. Management announced last month it had secured $10 billion in chip orders from a fourth unnamed client.

Tan told Cramer that Broadcom is working closely with ""about seven players,"" four of which he defined as ""real customers,"" or ones ""who have given us production purchase orders at scale.""

""We feel very good about it,"" Tan said of Broadcom's partnerships. ""Because each of these guys need a lot of compute capacity for them to basically play in this game and eventually win this game of creating the best foundation model in the world.""

In this article

Oracle CEO Clay Magouyrk, one of the two people tapped last month to lead the software company, is confident that OpenAI will be able to cover the costs of the massive amount of cloud infrastructure services it consumes.

In an interview with CNBC's David Faber at Oracle's AI World conference on Monday, Magouyrk said ""of course"" OpenAI can pay $60 billion for a year's worth of cloud resources. In July, OpenAI agreed to a five-year deal with Oracle that's worth more than $300 billion.

""Just look at the rate at which they've grown to, you know, almost a billion users. That's just unheard of,"" said Magouyrk, who sat alongside fellow Oracle CEO Mike Sicilia for the interview in Las Vegas.

OpenAI said last week that its flagship ChatGPT chatbot, which was publicly launched less than three years ago, now has 800 million weekly active users. In 2024, OpenAI recorded a $5 billion net loss.

Sicilia said Oracle has started integrating OpenAI artificial intelligence models into a patient portal for viewing electronic health records. Oracle acquired EHR vendor Cerner for about $28 billion in 2022.

""I've seen the results, and I really do think that they're going to have a dramatic impact on industries, on enterprises of all types,"" Sicilia said of OpenAI.

OpenAI rents out Nvidia graphics chips to run models through Oracle, as well as CoreWeave, Google and Microsoft. At the same time, the company is designing a custom AI processor that Broadcom will build. Earlier on Monday, Broadcom and OpenAI said they will jointly deploy 10 gigawatts worth of the new OpenAI chips.

Building out that much infrastructure requires a hefty amount of new energy.

""I think it's a factor of time, not a factor of if we'll have enough power,"" Sicilia said.

Oracle shares rose 5% on Monday. The stock has gained 84% this year, lifting Oracle's market cap close to $900 billion.

The rally in quantum computing names continued on Monday after JPMorgan Chase announced it as one of the areas it would invest in as part of a new initiative.

The bank said in a release that it would invest up to $10 billion in companies across four areas: supply chain and advanced manufacturing, defense and aerospace, energy technology, and frontier and strategic technologies — which includes quantum computing.

Arqit Quantum shares closed up 20%, while D-Wave Quantum ended 23% higher and Rigetti Computing gained 25%. IONQ climbed 16%, and Quantum Computing stock gained 12%.

""It has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing – all of which are essential for our national security,"" said CEO Jamie Dimon in a statement.

The initiative is part of a larger $1.5 trillion, decade-long plan, dubbed the ""Security and Resiliency Initiative,"" to finance and invest in industries JP Morgan deems critical to U.S. national and economic security.

As one of the 27 specified sub-areas the bank will be focusing on, quantum computing has seen gains as much as triple digits over the past month. Rigetti and D-Wave were up 175% and 130%, respectively.

Tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have shown significant interest in gate-model quantum computing, which can potentially solve problems too complex for standard computers.

Rigetti and IONQ quantum computers are accessible through Amazon Braket, a quantum computing service managed by Amazon Web Services.

In February, Microsoft unveiled its first quantum computing chip called Majorana 1, and Google announced its new breakthrough quantum chip named Willow late last year.

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory unit of NASA said Monday that it will lay off about 550 employees — 11% of JPL's workforce — as part of a restructuring.

The job cuts ""are not related to the current government shutdown,"" JPL Director Dave Gallagher said in a message to the unit that was posted on the lab's website.

JPL is a research and development lab funded by NASA — the federal space agency — and managed by the California Institute of Technology.

""While not easy, I believe that taking these actions now will help the Lab transform at the scale and pace necessary to help achieve humanity's boldest ambitions in space,"" Gallagher wrote in a separate mekor to JPL employees and contractors.

Gallagher, in the public announcement, noted that the reorganization of JPL began in July, and ""over the past few months, we have communicated openly with employees about the challenges and hard choices ahead.""

""This week's action, while not easy, is essential to securing JPL's future by creating a leaner infrastructure, focusing on our core technical capabilities, maintaining fiscal discipline, and positioning us to compete in the evolving space ecosystem — all while continuing to deliver on our vital work for NASA and the nation,"" Gallagher wrote.

Gallagher said that JPL employees will be notified of their status on Tuesday, and the ""new Lab structure ... will become effective Wednesday.""

A trader who attracted attention for successfully shorting Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) just before the recent crash added to their position even as the market rebounded on Sunday.

The investor opened the position at $117,369 and was sitting on an unrealized profit of $3.70 million as of this writing, according to decentralized perpetual exchange Hyperliquid. The trader took a 10x leverage bet to boost the position's value to over $163 million.

If Bitcoin reaches $123,510, which is 7.59% away from its current price, the trader will be liquidated.

Interestingly, the bet was taken despite the market's sharp rebound, with Bitcoin regaining $115,000 on Sunday.

The whale grabbed headlines after opening multi-million dollar short positions on BTC and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) right before President Donald Trump threatened to impose 100% tariffs on China.

The cryptocurrency market tumbled in response and the trader subsequently closed most of their short positions, netting a profit of $160 million.

If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

Maximize saving for your retirement and cut down on taxes: Schedule your free call with a financial advisor to start your financial journey – no cost, no obligation.

Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.

Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100. This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.

For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Property Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.

Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto. This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.

Moomoo isn't just for trading — it's also one of the most attractive places to park cash. New users can earn a promotional 8.1% APY on uninvested cash, combining a 3.85% base rate with a 4.25% booster once activated. On top of that, eligible new users can also score up to $1,000 in free Nvidia stock—but the real draw here is the ability to earn bank-beating interest rates without having to move into riskier assets.

SoFi gives members access to a wide range of professionally managed alternative funds, covering everything from commodities and private credit to venture capital, hedge funds, and real estate. These funds can provide broader diversification, help smooth out portfolio volatility, and potentially boost total returns over time. Many of the funds have relatively low minimums, making alternative investing accessible.

Range Wealth Management takes a modern, subscription-based approach to financial planning. Instead of charging asset-based fees, the platform offers flat-fee tiers that provide unlimited access to fiduciary advisors along with AI-powered planning tools. Investors can link their accounts without moving assets, while higher-level plans unlock advanced support for taxes, real estate, and multi-generational wealth strategies. This model makes Range especially appealing to high-earning professionals who want holistic advice and predictable pricing.

For investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides a simple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery. With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It's a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets.

Strategy (MSTR), the world's largest corporate owner of bitcoin BTC$113,759.59, appeared to miss out on capitalizing on last week's market rout to purchase the dip in prices.

According to Monday's press release, the firm bought 220 BTC at an average price of $123,561. The company used the proceeds of selling its various preferred stocks (STRF, STRK, STRD), raising $27.3 million. 

That purchase price was well above the prices the largest crypto changed hands in the second half of the week. Bitcoin nosedived from above $123,000 on Thursday to as low as $103,000 on late Friday during one, if not the worst crypto flash crash on record, liquidating over $19 billion in leveraged positions. 

That move occurred as Trump said to impose a 100% increase in tariffs against Chinese goods as a retaliation for tightening rare earth metal exports, reigniting fears of a trade war between the two world powers.

At its lowest point on Friday, BTC traded nearly 16% lower than the average of Strategy's recent purchase price. Even during the swift rebound over the weekend, the firm could have bought tokens between $110,000 and $115,000, at a 7%-10% discount compared to what it paid for.

With the latest purchase, the firm brought its total holdings to 640,250 BTC, at an average acquisition price of $73,000 since starting its bitcoin treasury plan in 2020.

MSTR, the firm's common stock, was up 2.5% on Monday.

Securitize's next chapter could be written on Wall Street. The blockchain firm, known for turning traditional assets into digital tokens, is reportedly in advanced talks to go public through a merger with Cantor Equity Partners II Inc. (NASDAQ:CEPT), a blank-check company backed by Cantor Fitzgerald LP. People familiar with the matter said the deal could value Securitize at more than $1 billion, though deliberations are still ongoing and the company could choose to stay private. Both Securitize and Cantor have not commented on the ongoing discussions.

Is CEPT fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.

Behind the headlines lies a much bigger shift: the tokenization of real-world assetsa concept once confined to crypto circlesis starting to draw serious institutional attention. Securitize, backed by BlackRock, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), ARK Venture Fund, Tradeweb Markets, and Nomura Holdings, has been building the pipes for that transformation. Its platform already hosts BlackRock's tokenized BUIDL fund, giving investors on-chain exposure to traditional assets like S&P indices and money-market instruments. For Wall Street, this could be an early sign of how blockchain technology is quietly threading into mainstream finance.

Securitize isn't just another crypto experiment. The firm is licensed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission as a registered transfer agent and operates across parts of Europe and Japanan unusual level of regulatory footing for a blockchain startup. Cantor Equity Partners II, led by Cantor Fitzgerald chairman Brandon Lutnick, raised $240 million in May through its IPO, giving it dry powder for such a deal. If the merger proceeds, it could become one of the most closely watched public listings in the digital-asset space, testing whether tokenization has finally earned a place on the public markets.","{'href': 'https://ca.finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo'}","cryptocurrency"

The Qubic Team

Oct 13, 2025



QubicBay is a next-generation NFT marketplace built on the Qubic tickchain where creativity, community, and cutting-edge technology come together. Think of it as a digital art gallery and trading platform rolled into one, where you can create, buy, sell, and collect unique digital assets.





Decentralized Ownership: Unlike traditional platforms controlled by a single company, QubicBay is owned by shareholders who earn revenue from marketplace activity. This means the community truly owns and benefits from the platform's success.

Lightning-Fast Transactions: Built on Qubic, one of the fastest blockchains ever certified, QubicBay offers incredibly fast and secure transactions.

Dual-Token System: The marketplace uses two tokens:

QUBIC coin: The primary currency for buying, selling, and minting NFTs

CFB token : Required to purchase minting packages when creating collections

Full NFT Functionality: QubicBay supports everything you need: minting new collections, buying and selling, transferring NFTs between wallets, and even auctions with dynamic pricing.



Before you can use QubicBay, you'll need a Qubic-compatible wallet. You have several options:

Qubic Web Wallet (wallet.qubic.org) - Easy to use from any browser

Qubic Mobile Wallet - Available for iOS and Android

Qubic Desktop Wallet - For Windows, Mac, and Linux

Setting up a wallet is straightforward: download or access your chosen wallet, create a new vault (or import an existing one), and securely store your private key.



You'll need QUBIC coins to buy NFTs and mint new ones. You can acquire QUBIC through CEX and DEX that support QUBIC.



If you plan to create your own NFT collections, you'll also need CFB tokens to purchase minting packages. CFB can be obtained through similar channels as QUBIC.



Buying NFTs on QubicBay is designed to be simple and intuitive:

Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

Visit QubicBay.io and connect your Qubic wallet to the platform. This secure connection allows you to browse, buy, and manage your NFTs.

Step 2: Browse Collections

Explore the marketplace to discover NFTs that interest you:

Use the search function to find specific collections or artists

Browse featured and trending collections

Check out verified collections for added authenticity

Filter by category or price

Step 3: Choose Your Purchase Method

Option A: Buy at Fixed Price

Click on the NFT you want to purchase

Review the details, price, and seller information

Click ""Buy Now""

Confirm the transaction in your wallet

The NFT is instantly transferred to your wallet

Option B: Make an Offer or Bid

If the NFT isn't listed at a fixed price, you can make an offer

Enter your proposed price in QUBIC or CFB

Submit your offer

Wait for the seller to accept or counter

For auctions, place your bid and wait until the auction ends

Important Notes:

Always verify collection authenticity by checking for verification badges

Ensure you have enough QUBIC to cover both the NFT price and transaction fees

Secondary sales include a 3% marketplace fee (1% goes to shareholders, 2% to the marketplace)



Step 1: Access Your Collection

Connect your wallet to QubicBay

Navigate to your profile to view your NFTs

Select the NFT you want to sell

Step 2: Create Your Listing

Fixed Price Sale:

Click ""List on Market""

Set your desired price in QUBIC

Confirm the listing

Auction Sale:

Select ""Auction"" as your sale type

Set a starting price

Choose your auction duration (e.g., 24 hours, 7 days)

Optionally set a reserve price (minimum you'll accept)

Launch the auction

Step 3: Manage Your Listing

Monitor offers and bids on your dashboard

Accept, reject, or counter offers as they come in

Update or cancel listings if needed (before a sale is made)



You can also transfer NFTs between wallets for free (just pay the minimal transaction fee):

Select the NFT to transfer

Enter the recipient's wallet address

Confirm the transfer

The NFT moves to the new owner instantly



Creating your own NFT collection is where QubicBay really shines for artists and creators. QubicBay offers two types of collections, each suited for different needs:

Normal Collection (Personal/Standard Collection)

A Normal Collection is perfect for artists who want full control over their NFTs:

Only you (the creator) can mint NFTs in this collection

You pay the creation fee upfront when creating the collection

Once created, minting NFTs costs 0 QUBIC (no additional minting fees)

Best for: Curated collections where you want complete control over every NFT

Drop Collection

A Drop Collection is designed for public mints and wider distribution:

Anyone can mint NFTs from your collection

You set the mint price and total supply

Collectors pay the mint price you've set to mint NFTs

Best for: Public launches, community drops, and projects where you want collectors to mint directly



QubicBay represents an exciting opportunity to participate in the growing NFT ecosystem on one of the fastest blockchains in the world. Whether you're an artist looking to showcase your work, a collector hunting for unique digital assets, or an investor exploring new opportunities, QubicBay provides the tools and community to help you succeed.

RavenQuest, a prominent sandbox MMORPG, has recently completed a significant $20,000 buyback of Land NFTs within its digital realm. This move aims to strengthen and stabilize the in-game economy, illustrating the developers' confidence in the project's long-term value and sustainability. Announced through official social media channels, this initiative marks “the beginning of the flywheel” for the RavenQuest ecosystem.

🚀🔥 BREAKING NEWS: FIRST $20,000 LAND NFT BUYBACK COMPLETE! 🔥🚀The flywheel has officially begun! We just swept $20,000 worth of Land NFTs directly from the market!And here's the kicker: THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING! We're staggering this process for maximum strategic impact.… pic.twitter.com/qg806MGcjI

The strategic acquisition of Land NFTs from the secondary market is designed to maintain market liquidity and support value within the ecosystem. By increasing trading activities among players and ensuring the assets' lasting utility, RavenQuest reinforces the foundational role of land in its game design. Land ownership in RavenQuest is not merely about holding a collectible; it is integral to gameplay, facilitating player housing, farming, crafting, and community building. This approach underscores the developer's commitment to enhancing the user experience and asset significance as the game world expands.

RavenQuest incorporates blockchain technology to create a multifaceted gaming experience where players engage in open-world exploration, resource gathering, and autonomous economic management. Land in RavenQuest is a tradable asset, providing real-world value, which pushes the boundaries of traditional and blockchain gaming scales.

The game supports a range of activities, including player versus player (PvP) combat, guild systems, and a governed economy, all underpinned by the $QUEST token. This token not only facilitates marketplace transactions but also acts as a reward mechanism within the game's economy.

This recent initiative by RavenQuest is not just a standalone event but the start of a series of strategic moves to ensure a vibrant economic environment within the game. As stated in their announcement, “THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING! We're staggering this process for maximum strategic impact.” The ongoing development efforts and innovative strategies highlight RavenQuest's pioneering approach in the evolving landscape of blockchain MMORPGs. The gaming community and market watchers are keenly observing whether this initiative will indeed kickstart the promised economic “flywheel,” setting a robust example for future developments in the Web3 gaming arena.

Oops, something went wrong

South Korean investors turned their Chuseok holiday into a week of aggressive risk-taking, funneling $1.24 billion into US tech and crypto-linked assets while domestic markets were closed between October 3 and 9.

Key Takeaways:

South Korean investors poured $1.24 billion into US tech and crypto-linked assets during the Chuseok holiday week.

Top buys included Tesla, Meta, and Bitcoin mining stocks, with leveraged ETFs leading the surge.

The buying spree ended abruptly as US–China trade tensions triggered a global market pullback.

Instead of taking time off during the country's Thanksgiving break, retail investors piled into leveraged ETFs and high-growth stocks, according to data from the Korea Securities Depository.

The most popular target was the Direxion Daily Tesla Bull 2X ETF, a leveraged fund that amplifies Tesla's stock movements, with net purchases totaling $151 million.

Other top buys included $105 million in Iris Energy, an Australian Bitcoin mining firm; $100 million in Meta Platforms, and $96 million in Tesla shares themselves.

Another leveraged crypto play, the T-REX 2X Long BMNR Daily Target ETF, which tracks Bitmine Immersion Technologies with double exposure, ranked fifth among foreign purchases at around $95 million.

The spree followed a strong rally in Seoul, where the Kospi Index hit new highs before the holiday amid optimism over US tech resilience and local stimulus plans.

With Korean exchanges closed, that bullish sentiment appeared to spill overseas as investors chased Wall Street's momentum.

But timing may have worked against them. The surge in cross-border buying came just days before global markets tumbled on renewed US–China trade tensions, erasing part of the previous week's gains.

Analysts say it remains to be seen whether Korean retail traders, known for their risk appetite and agility, will maintain such aggressive exposure.

The Kospi reopened 1.7% lower on Monday, slipping back below the 3,600 level and hinting that the Chuseok rally may have been short-lived.

In August, South Korea's financial regulator moved to rein in risky lending practices in the digital asset sector, ordering local exchanges to suspend all crypto lending services until a proper regulatory framework is established.

The crackdown came amid South Korea's broader pivot toward regulated crypto adoption. Authorities are lifting restrictions on institutional trading and preparing to approve the country's first spot crypto ETFs.

President Lee Jae Myung's administration is also working on a stablecoin framework pegged to the Korean won, signaling a more open approach to digital finance despite the latest curbs.

More recently, Dunamu, the operator of South Korea's largest cryptocurrency exchange Upbit, unveiled a new custody service aimed at corporate and institutional clients, as regulatory green lights for virtual asset investments spark growing demand for secure storage solutions.

The service stores all deposited digital assets in cold wallets, entirely offline and insulated from internet-based threats, to shield holdings from cyberattacks and other external breaches.

Strategy (MSTR), the world's largest corporate owner of bitcoin BTC$113,759.59, appeared to miss out on capitalizing on last week's market rout to purchase the dip in prices.

According to Monday's press release, the firm bought 220 BTC at an average price of $123,561. The company used the proceeds of selling its various preferred stocks (STRF, STRK, STRD), raising $27.3 million. 

That purchase price was well above the prices the largest crypto changed hands in the second half of the week. Bitcoin nosedived from above $123,000 on Thursday to as low as $103,000 on late Friday during one, if not the worst crypto flash crash on record, liquidating over $19 billion in leveraged positions. 

That move occurred as Trump said to impose a 100% increase in tariffs against Chinese goods as a retaliation for tightening rare earth metal exports, reigniting fears of a trade war between the two world powers.

At its lowest point on Friday, BTC traded nearly 16% lower than the average of Strategy's recent purchase price. Even during the swift rebound over the weekend, the firm could have bought tokens between $110,000 and $115,000, at a 7%-10% discount compared to what it paid for.

With the latest purchase, the firm brought its total holdings to 640,250 BTC, at an average acquisition price of $73,000 since starting its bitcoin treasury plan in 2020.

MSTR, the firm's common stock, was up 2.5% on Monday.

Bitcoin BTC$113,759.59 traders are catching their breath after one of the wildest weekends in the asset's history.

The flash crash that happened late Friday following Trump's 100% tariff announcement on Chinese imports wiped nearly $19 billion in crypto positions — the largest single-day liquidation on record. 

But some 48 hours later, the market looks steadier, with a bounce taking shape as both Washington and Beijing moved to cool tensions.

Alternative cryptocurrencies such as ADA$0.7174 and DOGE$0.2089 are leading the bounce. Both SDA aand DOGE have gained nearly 10% in 24 hours as discounted valuations enticed bargain hunters. 

Bitcoin BTC$113,759.59 climbed 2.7% over the past 24 hours to about $114,665, while ether ETH$4,167.95 surged 8.3% to $4,135. BNB gained 13.9%, a reminder that liquidity is flowing back toward ecosystem tokens. XRP rose 7.4%, Solana SOL$207.37 added 7.2%.

The market's message is clear: the broader bullish trend hasn't broken, but the volatility has reset sentiment. 

“What we just saw was a massive emotional reset,” said Justin d'Anethan, head of partnerships at Arctic Digital.

“Volatility cuts both ways — traders were punished on the way down and on the snap back. But the longer-term structure is intact. ETF inflows remain strong, exchange balances near cycle lows, and the broader narrative is arguably stronger after the washout,” he added.

That washout was no small thing. Over 6,300 wallets were liquidated on decentralized exchange Hyperliquid alone, with some traders losing millions in a cascade triggered by Auto-Deleveraging — a circuit-breaker that closes winning positions to cover systemic losses when insurance funds run dry.

It stopped bad debt, but it also magnified the fall, turning the correction into a structural event.

The rebound began over the weekend when China's Ministry of Commerce clarified that rare-earth export controls wouldn't be a blanket ban, while Trump himself posted that “the U.S.A wants to help China, not hurt it.”

Markets took that as a sign the trade war rhetoric was cooling, and risk assets bounced accordingly.

At this stage, crypto is moving in step with macro again. “If the U.S.–China spat doesn't escalate into a full-on trade war, the market is likely to recover and push back toward all-time highs,” said Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, in a note to CoinDesk.

The path ahead will hinge on rates and risk appetite. If central banks lean into easing, traders expect ETH and yield-generating tokens to outperform. Funding rates, options skew, and whale flows will show where fresh capital rotates next.

The setup is volatile, but the conviction remains. I'd say the shakeout burned leverage, not belief.

 Hyperliquid CEO Jeff Yan and data platform CoinGlass warned that the liquidation reporting method used by centralized exchanges, such as Binance, may undercount actual liquidations. 

Hyperliquid co-founder and CEO Jeff Yan claimed that the way centralized crypto exchanges, and Binance specifically, report liquidation data likely underrepresents the true scale of losses during major market sell-offs.

Bitcoin (BTC) fell to $102,000 on Friday after US President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on China. Ether (ETH) also dropped to $3,500, while Solana (SOL) slipped below $140 amid a marketwide sell-off.

According to data from CoinGlass, $16.7 billion worth of long positions and $2.46 billion in short positions were liquidated on Friday, marking the largest liquidation event in crypto history.

In a Monday X post, Yan pointed to a documentation page on the world's top crypto exchange, Binance, explaining that the platform will only include the latest liquidation happening in each second interval in the order snapshot stream.

The stream provides real-time updates on forced liquidations. While batching liquidations this way helps performance, Yan said the system likely results in major underreporting during periods of heavy volatility, when there can be more than 100 liquidations per pair per second.

“Because liquidations happen in bursts, this could easily be 100x under-reporting under some conditions,“ Yan wrote.

Yan's statement echoed a Saturday X post from crypto data platform CoinGlass. The platform said that “the actual [liquidated] amount was likely much higher” since “Binance only reports one liquidation order per second.”

Yan's comments follow over 1,000 Hyperliquid (HYPE) wallets being completely wiped out in the market crash on Friday. According to Lookonchain data, over 6,300 wallets are in the red with combined losses exceeding $1.23 billion.

Centralized crypto trading platforms ran into numerous issues during the flash crash. The world's top crypto exchange, Binance, in particular, has attracted considerable criticism over multiple reported issues.

In a Sunday X post, Binance CEO Yi He said Binance's core contract and spot matching engines, as well as API trading, remained stable throughout the event. She admitted, however, that “some individual functional modules of the platform did experience brief lags, and certain wealth management products experienced de-pegging.”

Still, she claimed that depegging events did not cause the market crash and that the peg happened because of, and after, the downturn itself. She also said that “Binance initiated and completed compensation” for users affected by the depegging, which amounted to over $280 million.

Widespread reports indicate that the price of some major altcoins reached $0 on Binance at the time of the mass liquidations. Pseudonymous crypto influencer Hanzo shared his experience during the downtime:

Binance later said the anomaly was a “display issue,” caused by changes to minimum price decimals for pairs such as IOTX/USDT, and not actual market data:

The Ethena USD (USDE) stablecoin maintained its peg on the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Curve (CURV), but it went severely off-peg on Binance and competing exchange Bybit. In a Saturday X post, Haseeb Qureshi — a managing partner at crypto venture capital fund Dragonfly — pointed out that USDE hit $0.95 on Bybit and well under $0.70 on Binance, but did not lose its peg on Curve.

Guy Young, the founder of Ethena Labs, said that USDe minting and redeeming worked “perfectly” during Friday's flash crash. Data he shared showed that $2 billion in USDe was redeemed during 24 hours across crypto exchanges, including Curve, Fluid and Uniswap.

Tom Cohen, head of investment and trading at quantitative crypto asset management firm Algoz, told Cointelegraph that “the start can be traced to roughly $60–$90 billion of USDe simultaneously dumped onto Binance to exploit a mispricing and this triggered a series of large sell-offs.” This sell-off, he said, “moved thinly traded markets very quickly.”

Hyperliquid also pat itself on the back following the reported centralized exchange outages. The platform wrote in a Saturday X post that ”during the recent market volatility, the Hyperliquid blockchain had zero downtime or latency issues despite record traffic and volumes.”

“This was an important stress test proving that Hyperliquid's decentralized and fully on-chain financial system can be robust and scalable,” the post stated.

 Analysts say confusion over China's export rules briefly rattled markets before Bitcoin miners led a swift recovery on Monday. 

Shares of Bitcoin mining companies rose sharply on Monday, recovering from losses sustained during Friday's flash crash that analysts attributed to US President Donald Trump's apparent misunderstanding of new Chinese export controls.

Bitfarms (BITF) and Cipher Mining (CIFR) led the rally, each posting double-digit gains. Hut 8 Mining (HUT), IREN (IREN) and MARA Holdings (MARA) also climbed more than 4%, while Core Scientific (CORZ) and Riot Blockchain (RIOT) traded broadly higher at the start of the session.

The rebound followed a steep sell-off on Friday after Trump announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, stoking fears of an escalating trade war. The president's comments, however, were later revealed to be based on a misunderstanding of China's new export measures. Trump subsequently walked back his remarks over the weekend.

In a follow-up post on Truth Social, Trump wrote: “Don't worry about China, it will all be fine!” adding, “Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment.”

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later clarified that the proposed 100% tariffs on China “don't have to happen.”

“This confirms our view that President Trump misinterpreted export controls announced on October 10th,” market commentator The Kobeissi Letter wrote, referring to China's expansion of export restrictions on rare earth minerals for defense and semiconductor industries.

Related: $19B crypto market crash: Was it leverage, China tariffs or both?

While Friday's sell-off in crypto-related stocks was steep, the turbulence in digital assets themselves was far more severe.

In dollar terms, Friday's flash crash marked the largest liquidation event in crypto history — surpassing even the FTX collapse — with roughly $19 billion in leveraged positions wiped out. Bitcoin (BTC) proved relatively resilient compared to altcoins, which saw steeper losses from peak to trough.

The sell-off was so intense that Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek called for regulators to investigate exchanges' handling of the event. Marszalek questioned whether some platforms slowed down, mispriced assets or failed to maintain adequate compliance controls during the crash.

Roughly half of all liquidations occurred on Hyperliquid, a decentralized perpetual futures exchange, where about $10.3 billion in positions were erased. Bybit and Binance also reported significant liquidations.

Binance faced additional scrutiny amid reports that several token prices briefly fell to zero. The exchange later said the anomaly was caused by a user interface display bug affecting certain trading pairs. Separately, Binance was linked to an exploit that caused Ethena's synthetic dollar, USDe, to lose its dollar peg during the same period.

Guy Young, founder of USDe issuer Ethena Labs, later clarified that the depeg was unrelated to the USDe minting or redemption process and was instead an isolated issue on Binance:

 The Hyperliquid trader made millions from short positions placed just minutes before Trump's tariff announcement, sparking wild theories. 

A huge crypto derivatives speculator that recently made $192 million betting on the crypto market with a curiously timed short has opened up more bearish positions. 

The whale trader (0xb317) on the Hyperliquid decentralized derivatives exchange has opened a $163 million leveraged perpetual contract to short Bitcoin (BTC) on Sunday.

The 10x leveraged position is currently valued at $3.5 million in profit, but it will be liquidated if BTC reaches $125,500.

The entity attracted attention from the crypto community after opening a short position just 30 minutes before Trump's tariff announcement on Friday, which sent the crypto market plummeting but netted them $192 million in profits.

The entity is being labeled an “insider whale” by the crypto community due to the uncanny timing of the trades, opening minutes before a major announcement.

Some theorize that the whale itself caused a massive leverage flush that crushed crypto markets over the weekend.  

“The crazy part is that he shorted another nine figures worth of BTC and ETH minutes before the cascade happened,” said observer “MLM,” who added, “And this was just publicly on Hyperliquid, imagine what he did on CEXs or elsewhere.”

Over 250 wallets lost millionaire status on Hyperliquid since Friday's crash, reported HyperTracker on Sunday. 

Meanwhile, another more bullish trader opened a 40x leveraged $11 million long position in Bitcoin. 

“Crypto people are realizing today what it means to have unregulated markets: Insider trading, corruption, crime, and zero accountability,” commented SWP Berlin researcher Janis Kluge. 

It has also been suggested that Binance may have played a role in the meltdown, as its own order books and market maker reportedly failed, stop-losses didn't execute, traders were liquidated en masse, and several tokens reportedly depegged or crashed to zero. 

However, the exchange issued an update to users claiming that there was no crash because it was a “display issue.” 

“We are aware of speculation in the market regarding the causes of this event, with some focusing on the role of the Binance platform,” the company stated on Sunday. 

It confirmed that during the event, the core futures and spot matching engines and API trading “remained operational.”

Binance denied that the depegging of USDE, BNSOL and WBETH caused the market crash, but offered around $283 million in compensation to traders holding these assets as collateral who were liquidated.

The Binance exchange's native token, BNB (BNB), has recovered strongly, surging 14% over the past 24 hours to surpass $1,300 again.

Shimon Sakaguchi Reflects on How Hunting for a Mysterious T Cell Earned Him a Nobel Prize

Nobel laureate Shimon Sakaguchi reflects on the role of regulatory T cells in peripheral immune tolerance and how the cells could transform treatment for cancer, autoimmune disease and organ transplant rejection

In 2006 immunologist and 2025 Nobel prize winner Shimon Sakaguchi co-wrote an article in Scientific American that now feels prophetic. In the story, entitled “Peacekeepers of the Immune System,” Sakaguchi traced a time line of important studies that led to his discovery of an elusive type of immune cell he called regulatory T cells.

In the 1980s the field had largely dismissed the existence of such a class of cells, but Sakaguchi and other scientists proved that regulatory T cells, or Tregs, are the integral “peacekeepers” that prevent the immune system from overreacting and harming the body itself. That process, known as peripheral immune tolerance, stops the body's primary defense mechanism from entering self-destruct mode, called autoimmunity.

The experiments Sakaguchi cataloged in Scientific American nearly 20 years ago were recognized last week at the 2025 Nobel award ceremony in Stockholm, where he and immunologists Mary E. Brunkow and Fred Ramsdell shared the prize in physiology or medicine for their discoveries.

“I didn't expect it, and of course, I was very much pleased,” Sakaguchi says. “I'm happy to have this honor. But at the same time, I really appreciate the community of scientists who have worked together. The progress of this field is really due to the collective effort of many scientists and immunologists.”

In an exclusive interview, Scientific American caught up with Sakaguchi on October 7 EDT, the day after the award announcement. He discussed the crucial findings that led to the discovery of regulatory T cells and clinical trials that harness these cells to potentially treat chronic infections, cancer and autoimmune diseases.

[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]

What was your journey into looking for cells that suppressed the immune system? What drew you to them?

I was very much interested in autoimmune diseases because our immune system normally defends our cells from invading microbes—viruses and bacteria—but sometimes it's aggressive and destroys our body cells and causes autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes. So the immune system has two aspects: good and bad. What's the mechanism behind this? If we can understand that mechanism, we may be able to treat autoimmune diseases—or the opposite: make the immune system attack abnormal cells, such as cancer cells, arising in our body.

That was my interest when I was a student in medical school, and then I became a researcher to tackle this conundrum. At that time [in the 1980s], the only available approach to study autoimmunity was the mouse model. I happened to find that newborn mice, if you remove the thymus [an organ in the chest that produces various types of T cells], they spontaneously develop autoimmunelike diseases. And then what was interesting was: if you inoculate the thymus-free mice with normal T cells from nonaffected adult mice, you can prevent disease development—meaning that in the normal collection of T cells in the thymus, there must be some cells that can prevent or suppress disease development. That was the start of my research career.

What convinced you that regulatory T cells existed when others abandoned the theory?

I was convinced that autoimmune diseases, similar to [how they can arise] in humans, can be produced in healthy animals by just manipulating the immune system—removing certain T cells. That was always a very solid phenomenon for me. If other hypotheses or other ideas could explain what we saw, I would follow that concept or idea. I always compared what I believed and what [other theories] showed—which one had better explanatory powers. Our results were not so bad—and were even better—so that was the reason that I continued my research on regulatory T cells.

It is really a key issue in modern immunology: How can we realize or understand why the immune system does not react with ourselves?

In 2006 you wrote an article for Scientific American entitled “Peacekeepers of the Immune System.” How did you come up with the name “peacekeepers” for the cells?

That was coined by my colleague and co-author of that article, Zoltan Fehervari—he's now an editor of Nature. At that time, we talked about how we can name them and make them more relatable. And then he came up with that idea: “peacekeeper.” It was a really nice name because, later on, we gradually realized that regulatory T cells not only are immunosuppressive but also have various other functions, such as promoting tissue repair. So they are peacekeepers for many things.

You essentially documented in the article how pivotal this work was nearly two decades ago. Did you think back then that your research would be recognized for a Nobel Prize?

Actually, I didn't. I really hoped that we could have a better understanding of immunological self-tolerance. It's a long-standing, important question in immunology. Even the 1960 Nobel awards were awarded to Peter Medawar and Frank Macfarlane Burnet, who showed that immune tolerance is acquired, not innate. Well, that's really interesting, but how does it happen? There have been several theories, including clonal deletion: deleting the dangerous self-reactive clones [of T cells]. They are eliminated when they are immature and being produced in the immune system. But that couldn't explain how usual autoimmune diseases happen—for example, type 1 diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. So it is really a key issue in modern immunology: How can we realize or understand why the immune system does not react with ourselves?

Are there any therapies or applications of your work that are close to making it to the clinic?

What is fascinating about regulatory T cells is that they are specialized for immune suppression, and so this means that if you strengthen their functions or increase their numbers, it could be a good way to treat autoimmunity or allergies or various diseases. On the other hand, if you reduce the number of these cells or make their function weaker, then the immune response can be enhanced. So it could be good for cancer immunity. We are pursuing both directions, our team and many others. There are many, many trials underway—at the Nobel announcement, the chairperson told us that more than 200 clinical trials are ongoing now.

Our approach is a bit challenging. For the cancer immunity, we're looking into how to increase the efficacy of current cancer immunotherapies. For example, current immune checkpoint blockade [a type of therapy that uses lab-made antibodies, or inhibitors, that block signals so the immune response can attack cancer cells] is maybe 20 to 30 percent effective and not curative. So our idea is: regulatory T cells are really abundant in cancer tissue and are suppressing effective antitumor immune responses. How can we remove them in tumor tissue? Antibodies can be designed to remove Tregs. We could combine that with the current immune checkpoint blockade and maybe make the cancer immunotherapy more effective.

If you think about the future, we could develop an oral drug of small molecules that may have a similar effect as the molecular antibodies against Tregs [molecules that are typically delivered intravenously in most trials]. Then we can improve cancer immunotherapy, not only in developed countries but also in developing countries.

You mentioned this could be the basis for cancer treatments. How about infections that suppress the immune system, such as HIV/AIDS?

So increasing immune response could be good in a tumor immunity setting but also for chronic infection. We still don't know if it would work, but if strengthening the immune response can be achieved by reducing Treg numbers, I think that's one idea for tackling chronic infections.

What advice would you like to give early-career scientists?

It's maybe a common one, but really what is important is: if you are interested in something, in science or whatever, then pursue and continue working on that. Your interests may change along the course of your study or through your efforts, but you'll find something in the landscape. Someday you might realize that now you are doing something different from others that's more fascinating than what you originally pursued. Nowadays you are expected to do something very, very soon and have a result. But it always takes time to arrive at something important.

If Starlink continues scaling up operations, there could be as many as five of these satellites raining down on us daily.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

It's a bird, it's a plane, it's... probably a hunk of trash metal from yet another de-orbited Starlink satellite burning up in the atmosphere.

Starlink constellations are only adding to the swarm of space junk in low-Earth orbit. While the SpaceX answer to affordable worldwide internet may not be the worst threat to our part of the cosmos—especially compared to other, larger satellites—one to two of their 8,000 satellites are already falling back to terra firma every single day. And there could soon be as many as five daily de-orbits, once Starlink and other companies such as Amazon and Kuiper collectively get 30,000 satellites hovering above us. That doesn't even count the Chinese systems, which are predicted to add another 20,000. 

If Starlink keeps going this way, it could put Earth on the fast track to Kessler syndrome—what is predicted to happen when there are so many useless satellites, used rocket stages, metal fragments, and other bits of refuse orbiting our planet that they crash into each other and trigger a chain reaction of further collisions. This could clog up low-earth orbit to the point of not having enough space for any more satellites and obscuring the view of the night sky for telescopes on the ground. 

Smithsonian astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell tracks everything that goes up and comes down on his website Jonathan's Space Report—a leading source of information on spacecraft launches and reentries. And what he is seeing has him concerned. His latest update logged eleven groups of Starlink satellites launched from August 18 to September 13. He also keeps a graph that shows how many of these satellites have been de-orbited since 2020, with numbers peaking in 2025.

“For the low-orbit satellites we expect a 5-year replacement cycle, and that translates to 5 reentries a day,” he recently told EarthSky. “It's not clear if the Chinese will orbit-lower theirs or just accelerate us to chain-reaction Kessler syndrome.”

These satellites only have a lifespan of 5 to 7 years, which is why McDowell sees a future of falling Starlink spacecraft. They can also malfunction and come crashing down, a phenomenon that can be affected by solar activity. The last solar maximum has just barely passed, and this is the peak of solar activity in the Sun's 11-year cycle—from solar flares to sunspots to coronal mass ejections—can send charged solar wind particles flying through space to disrupt electrical infrastructure, communications, and satellites. Solar storms also heat up the atmosphere, which then expands and thickens, causing aerodynamic drag for anything in low-Earth orbit. This can cause satellites can start to act sluggish and drop further down into the atmosphere. Some can be boosted back up, but others are doomed to fall.

And it gets worse. NOAA researchers found an unexpected density of metal (like copper, lithium, and aluminum) and rare metal (like hafnium and niobium) particles in the stratosphere, and we don't yet know how safe these are. They could possibly end up involved in chemical reactions that destroy the ozone layer. 

Meanwhile, Starlink continues to scale up operations with an unknown future.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Woah—An Ancient Artwork Has Vanished from a Cursed Egyptian Tomb","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a69001995/egypt-tomb-robbery/","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

The large relief is one of only two known pieces of art that depict illustrations of the seasons. Now it's gone.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Rising from Egypt's vast ocean of sand, Saqqara is the country's most expansive necropolis. Among the Old Kingdom monuments in this city of the dead is the famed step pyramid of the pharaoh Djoser. There are also several mastabas (rectangular tombs built of mudbrick, or limestone), the oldest of which is a relic from the First Dynasty that dates back to the reign of Hor Aha.

But there has been a disturbance. Something from one of these funerary edifices is now missing.

Another artifact has vanished from Egypt, not even a month after a 3,000-year-old bracelet that once belonged to the pharaoh Amenemope was stolen from Cairo's Egyptian Museum, trafficked on the black market and melted down for its gold. Now, a limestone relief from the mastaba of Khentika—royal vizier to the Sixth Dynasty pharaoh Teti during the last years of his reign, sometime between 2700 B.C.E. and 2200 B.C.E—has disappeared. 

“All necessary legal actions have been taken and the matter has been forwarded to the public prosecutor for investigation,” the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities said in an official statement, reinforcing its resolve to ensure that “the Egyptian archaeological heritage is preserved and protected from any violations or illegal practices.”

This particular relief is an especially rare find, as it is one of only two known reliefs that depicts the illustration of the seasons. Khentika is shown at an easel, brush in hand, painting the three seasons on the Egyptian calendar that follow the ebb and flow of the Nile. Akhet was the season of the inundation, when the Nile flooded and restored nutrients to the soil in its floodplains. The planting season was Peret (when the Nile receded), and Shemu began the harvest.

Viziers (most famously Imhotep) often came close to their pharaohs in prestige. Khentika's titles included “Priest of the Goddess Maat” and “Overseer of the Royal Palace,” and his tomb (and its rare relief) was originally discovered by British Egyptologist T.B.H. James in 1952. Room I—where the relief was located—is thought to be the entrance chamber of the mastaba. The relief covered a large monolith on the south wall of this room, blocking a doorway that was supposed to lead to Room V.

James observed some differences between the reliefs of Khentika and Mereruka, a fellow vizier and the husband of one of Teti's daughters, whose tomb was built only a few years before. While both reliefs are at the entrances of their respective tombs, the personified versions of the seasons in Khentika's relief are kneeling as opposed to sitting in chairs, and are also not marked by their corresponding hieroglyphs. Khentika also does not have a second easel behind his shoulder, or an ink palette over his shoulder as Mereruka does. While both he and Mereruka have water pots before them, only Khentika has an object that appears to be a stand for the pot. Khentika also has three attendants—his son Djedi-teti, his official Mesi, and an unidentified third attendant are bringing writing materials to him.

“The tomb is distinguished by its remarkable reliefs portraying scenes of daily life in ancient Egypt,” archaeologist Ali Abu Deshish told CBS News, declaring the theft “a catastrophe by all standards” and announcing that Egypt's antiquities “are not for sale. They belong to the heritage of all humanity.”

Whoever stole this relief might have not been aware that Khentika's mastaba is one of the few to be inscribed with a curse. Divine punishment threatens intruders, so trespass at your own peril.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Scientists Think Time Travel Is Possible—If We Could Move at Warp Speed","https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/rockets/a69001110/time-travel-warp-speed/","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 18:00:00 GMT","

It's the edge case of all edge cases, but it's still worth thinking about.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Two physicists from the University of Queensland in Australia recently laid out a model for studying hypothetical time travel. Their work expands on what's called the Alcubierre spacetime, first published by physicist Miguel Alcubierre over 30 years ago. Time travel is very hypothetical, with a few paths that scientists explore mostly for fun and to push the boundaries of physics research in interesting directions. In that spirit, the Australian physicists have tweaked the Alcubierre theory to take one more step into the beyonds of time travel.

Alcubierre is invoked more often as a possible (and, again, very hypothetical) path to travel at “warp speed,” or faster than the speed of light. In our known universe, it isn't possible to travel faster than light speed, because the physics of our particular spacetime just don't allow it. To skirt this fact, the Alcubierre drive involves making a bubble of sorts that moves spacetime itself from the front to the back of the spacecraft. It's kind of like the spaceship is sitting on your dining room table while you pull the tablecloth of spacetime out from under it. 

In their introduction, the scientists explain that they also use Austro-Hungarian mathematician Kurt Gödel's idea of a spacetime allowing for “closed timelike curves” (CTCs) in their argument. Gödel published his idea in 1949 as part of a special solution to an enduring set of equations by Albert Einstein. In 1994, Alcubierre himself said that his “Alcubierre bubble” might be constrained so that it, too, can have CTCs.

“This seems intuitive, as protocols that allow for superluminal travel can generally be used to create a time machine with a slight modification,” the scientists wrote. Now, intuition doesn't always lead to scientific results, but in the three decades since Alcubierre's presentation of his warp drive idea, others have found that you could time travel using two Alcubierre bubbles or by capitalizing on a special case of rotating spacetime. (‘Could' is doing some heavy lifting here—this is pure science, not a blueprint.)

So, what's the latest step forward in this corner of theoretical physics? Quantum information legend Tim C. Ralph joined forces with Ph.D. candidate Achintya Sajeendran to publish a paper in the peer-reviewed journal APS Physical Review D. In their paper, they stabilize one measurement of an Alcubierre spacetime by anchoring it to coordinates in the bubble, turning the CTCs into complex shapes called geodesic circles. 

Dubbing these “closed timelike geodesics” (CTGs), Ralph and Sajeendran explain in the paper: “Such a CTG would be ideal for studying situations in which a particle interacts with its past or future self, such as the billiard ball problem, and may generally serve as a useful playground for investigating classical and quantum models of time travel.”

In other words, this is a specially controlled case of a specially controlled case, and by limiting the variables even further than before, scientists may be able to shake loose new insights into the mind-boggling questions that come up when thinking about time travel, Alcubierre bubbles, or anything else that veers off the beaten path of classical physics.

And wait, what's the “billiard ball problem?” It's a great illustration of exactly how mind-boggling time travel theories can be. In pocket spacetimes (pun intended) with closed timelike curves, one billiard ball may not have one predictable path. What if one lands in a wormhole, scientists wondered in 1990, where it might generate two outcomes instead of one predictable outcome? What if, they wondered in 2017, the billiard ball could collide with its own past self?

These examples can sound a bit slapstick-y, but the philosophical-sounding edge cases help scientists refine their models and explore how and where their theories may fail. Indeed, that's exactly the point for Ralph and Sajeendran, who conclude: “Despite the questionable physical realisability of our metric, we suggest that it may provide a useful background for future theoretical studies of classical and quantum models of time travel in a general relativistic setting.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","90% of science is lost. This new AI just found it","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251013040314.htm","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 12:48:54 GMT","

Most scientific data never reach their full potential to drive new discoveries.

Out of every 100 datasets produced, about 80 stay within the lab, 20 are shared but seldom reused, fewer than two meet FAIR standards, and only one typically leads to new findings.

The consequences are significant: slower progress in cancer treatment, climate models that lack sufficient evidence, and studies that cannot be replicated.

To change this, the open-science publisher Frontiers has introduced Frontiers FAIR² Data Management, described as the world's first comprehensive, AI-powered research data service. It is designed to make data both reusable and properly credited by combining all essential steps -- curation, compliance checks, AI-ready formatting, peer review, an interactive portal, certification, and permanent hosting -- into one seamless process. The goal is to ensure that today's research investments translate into faster advances in health, sustainability, and technology.

FAIR² builds on the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) with an expanded open framework that guarantees every dataset is AI-compatible and ethically reusable by both humans and machines. The FAIR² Data Management system is the first working implementation of this model, arriving at a moment when research output is growing rapidly and artificial intelligence is reshaping how discoveries are made. It turns high-level principles into real, scalable infrastructure with measurable impact.

Dr. Kamila Markram, co-founder and CEO of Frontiers, explains:

""Ninety percent of science vanishes into the void. With Frontiers FAIR² Data Management, no dataset and no discovery need ever be lost again -- every contribution can now fuel progress, earn the credit it deserves, and unleash science.""

AI at the Core 

Work that once required months of manual effort -- from organizing and verifying datasets to generating metadata and publishable outputs -- is now completed in minutes by the AI Data Steward, powered by Senscience, the Frontiers venture behind FAIR².

Researchers who submit their data receive four integrated outputs: a certified Data Package, a peer-reviewed and citable Data Article, an Interactive Data Portal featuring visualizations and AI chat, and a FAIR² Certificate. Each element includes quality controls and clear summaries that make the data easier to understand for general users and more compatible across research disciplines.

Together, these outputs ensure that every dataset is preserved, validated, citable, and reusable, helping accelerate discovery while giving researchers proper recognition. Frontiers FAIR² also enhances visibility and accessibility, supporting responsible reuse by scientists, policymakers, practitioners, communities, and even AI systems, allowing society to extract greater value from its investment in science.

Flagship Pilot Datasets 

SARS-CoV-2 Variant Properties  -- Covering 3,800 spike protein variants, this dataset links structural predictions from AlphaFold2 and ESMFold with ACE2 binding and expression data. It offers a powerful resource for pandemic preparedness, enabling deeper understanding of variant behavior and fitness.

Preclinical Brain Injury MRI  -- A harmonized dataset of 343 diffusion MRI scans from four research centers, standardized across protocols and aligned for comparability. It supports reproducible biomarker discovery, robust cross-site analysis, and advances in preclinical traumatic brain injury research.

Environmental Pressure Indicators (1990-2050) -- Combining observed data and modeled forecasts across 43 countries over six decades, this dataset tracks emissions, waste, population, and GDP. It underpins sustainability benchmarking and evidence-based climate policy planning.

Indo-Pacific Atoll Biodiversity -- Spanning 280 atolls across five regions, this dataset integrates biodiversity records, reef habitats, climate indicators, and human-use histories. It provides an unprecedented basis for ecological modeling, conservation prioritization, and cross-regional research on vulnerable island ecosystems.

Researchers testing the pilots noted that Frontiers FAIR² not only preserves and shares data but also builds confidence in its reuse -- through quality checks, clear summaries for non-specialists, and the reliability to combine datasets across disciplines, all while ensuring scientists receive credit.

All pilot datasets comply with the FAIR² Open Specification, making them responsibly curated, reusable, and trusted for long-term human and machine use so today's data can accelerate tomorrow's solutions to society's most pressing challenges.

Recognition and Reuse 

Each reuse multiplies the value of the original dataset, ensuring that no discovery is wasted, every contribution can spark the next breakthrough, and researchers gain recognition for their work.

Dr. Sean Hill, co-founder and CEO of Senscience, the Frontiers AI venture behind FAIR² Data Management, notes:

""Science invests billions generating data, but most of it is lost -- and researchers rarely get credit. With Frontiers FAIR², every dataset is cited, every scientist recognized -- finally rewarding the essential work of data creation. That's how cures, climate solutions, and new technologies will reach society faster -- this is how we unleash science.""

What Researchers Are Saying 

Dr. Ángel Borja, Principal Researcher, AZTI, Marine Research, Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA):

""I highly [recommend using] this kind of data curation and publication of articles, because you can generate information very quickly and it's useful formatting for any end users.""

Erik Schultes, Senior Researcher, Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research (LACDR); FAIR Implementation Lead, GO FAIR Foundation:

""Frontiers FAIR² captured the scientific aspects of the project perfectly.""

Femke Heddema, Researcher and Health Data Systems Innovation Manager, PharmAccess:

""Frontiers FAIR² makes the execution of FAIR principles smoother for researchers and digital health implementers, proving that making datasets like MomCare reusable doesn't have to be complex. By enabling transparent, accessible, and actionable data, Frontiers FAIR² opens the door to new opportunities in health research.""

Dr. Neil Harris, Professor in Residence, Department of Neurosurgery, Brain Injury Research Center, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA):

""Implementation of [Frontiers] FAIR² can provide an objective check on data for both missingness and quality that is useful on so many levels. These types of unbiased assessments and data summaries can aid understanding by non-domain experts to ultimately enhance data sharing. As the field progresses to using big data in more disparate sub-disciplines, these data checks and summaries will become crucial to maintaining a good grasp of how we might use and combine the multitude of already acquired data within our current analyses.""

Maryann Martone, Chief Editor, Open Data Commons:

""[Frontiers] FAIR² is one of the easiest and most effective ways to make data FAIR. Every PI wants their data to be findable, accessible, comparable, and reusable -- in the lab, with collaborators, and across the scientific community. The real bottleneck has always been the time and effort required. [Frontiers] FAIR² dramatically lowers that barrier, putting truly FAIR data within reach for most labs.""

Dr. Vincent Woon Kok Sin, Assistant Professor, Carbon Neutrality and Climate Change Thrust, Society Hub, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST):

""[Frontiers] FAIR² makes our global waste dataset more visible and accessible, helping researchers worldwide who often struggle with scarce and fragmented data. I hope this will broaden collaboration and accelerate insights for sustainable waste management.""

Dr. Sebastian Steibl, Postdoctoral Researcher, Naturalis Biodiversity Center and the University of Auckland:

""True data accessibility goes beyond just uploading datasheets to a repository. It means making data easy to view, explore, and understand without necessarily requiring years of training. The [Frontiers] FAIR² platform, with an AI chatbot and interactive visual data exploration and summary tools, makes our biodiversity and environmental data broadly accessible and usable not just to scholars, but also practitioners, policymakers, and local community initiatives.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Earth's climate just crossed a line we can't ignore","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251013040325.htm","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 14:20:24 GMT","

Humanity is entering a ""new reality,"" as scientists warn that the planet has now crossed the first of several critical Earth system tipping points. Without immediate global action, these shifts could cause widespread and lasting damage, according to a major report released today (Oct 13) by the University of Exeter and international collaborators.

As ministers meet ahead of the COP30 summit, the second Global Tipping Points Report concludes that warm-water coral reefs -- vital to nearly a billion people and a quarter of marine species -- have already passed their threshold of stability. Mass coral die-off is underway and, unless global warming is reversed, large reef systems as we know them will disappear. A few isolated refuges may endure, but they will require urgent protection.

Researchers warn that this is only the beginning. The world is nearing other irreversible tipping points that could trigger devastating consequences for people and ecosystems, including the melting of polar ice sheets, disruption of major ocean currents, and the collapse of the Amazon rainforest -- where COP30 will take place.

With global temperatures expected to exceed 1.5°C, the report -- produced by 160 scientists across 87 institutions in 23 countries -- urges governments to limit any temperature overshoot to prevent further irreversible changes. Every fraction of a degree and every additional year above 1.5°C increases the risks.

The authors say that the best hope now lies in accelerating ""positive tipping points,"" such as the rapid spread of clean energy technologies that can drive large-scale, self-reinforcing change. These shifts could provide a viable path toward a safer, fairer, and more sustainable world.

Researchers are working with Brazil's COP30 Presidency to ensure that the issue of tipping points is prioritized at the upcoming summit.

Professor Tim Lenton of the University of Exeter's Global Systems Institute said: ""We are rapidly approaching multiple Earth system tipping points that could transform our world, with devastating consequences for people and nature. This demands immediate, unprecedented action from leaders at COP30 and policymakers worldwide.

""In the two years since the first Global Tipping Points Report, there has been a radical global acceleration in some areas, including the uptake of solar power and electric vehicles. But we need to do more -- and move faster -- to seize positive tipping point opportunities. By doing so, we can drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions and tip the world away from catastrophic tipping points and towards a thriving, sustainable future.""

Dr. Mike Barrett, chief scientific advisor at WWF-UK and a co-author of the report, added: ""The findings of this report are incredibly alarming. That warm-water coral reefs are passing their thermal tipping point is a tragedy for nature and the people that rely on them for food and income. This grim situation must be a wake-up call that unless we act decisively now, we will also lose the Amazon rainforest, the ice sheets and vital ocean currents. In that scenario we would be looking at a truly catastrophic outcome for all humanity.

""As we head into the COP30 climate negotiations it's vital that all parties grasp the gravity of the situation and the extent of what we all stand to lose if the climate and nature crises are not addressed. The solutions are within our reach. Countries must show the political bravery and leadership to work together and achieve them.""

The report says that the nature of abrupt and irreversible Earth system tipping points mean that they pose a different type of threat to other environmental challenges, and that current policies and decision-making processes are not adequate to respond. Global action must include accelerating emissions reductions and scaling up carbon removal to minimise temperature overshoot. The expected impacts of tipping processes need to be considered in risk assessments, adaptation policies, loss and damage mechanisms and human rights litigation.

Dr. Manjana Milkoreit, from the University of Oslo, said: ""Current policy thinking doesn't usually take tipping points into account. Tipping points present distinct governance challenges compared to other aspects of climate change or environmental decline, requiring both governance innovations and reforms of existing institutions.

""Preventing tipping points requires 'frontloaded' mitigation pathways that minimise peak global temperature, the duration of the overshoot period above 1.5°C, and the return time below 1.5°C. Sustainable carbon dioxide removal approaches need to be rapidly scaled up to achieve this.""

The report's authors are working with Brazil's COP30 Presidency on the ""Action Agenda"" as a platform for accelerating climate transition plans and triggering self-reinforcing change across different sectors -- from agriculture to energy, from forests to cities -- towards low-carbon and climate-resilient global transformation.

The President Designate of COP30 in Brazil, Ambassador André Corrêa do Lago, said: ""As part of a global mobilization against climate change -- our 'Global Mutirão' -- the COP30 Presidency invited community leaders, scholars and scientists to explore the best available science and ancestral wisdom around how our institutions can gain exponentiality in deploying solutions and versatility in responding to the climate crisis, including through agile, iterative and adaptive capabilities. I welcome the Global Tipping Points Report as a positive and timely response to our invitation. The report stands as hopeful and sober evidence that humanity can still choose to change and evolve towards a safe, prosperous and equitable future.""

The report highlights progress on positive tipping points -- and opportunities for a cascade of positive change:

The report includes case studies on several Earth system tipping points:

Professor Lenton concluded: ""Only with a combination of decisive policy and civil society action can the world tip its trajectory from facing existential Earth system tipping point risks to seizing positive tipping point opportunities.""

Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and Influenza A viruses (IAV) induce Z-form nucleic acid Binding Protein 1 (ZBP1)-initiated cell death1-8. ZBP1 is activated by Z-RNA1,7,9, and the Z-RNAs which trigger ZBP1 during HSV-1 and IAV infections were assumed to be of viral origin1. However, we show here that host cell-encoded Z-RNAs are major and sufficient ZBP1 activating ligands following infection by these two human pathogens. The majority of cellular Z-RNAs mapped to intergenic endogenous retroelements (EREs) embedded within abnormally long 3' extensions of host cell mRNAs. These aberrant host cell transcripts arose as a consequence of Disruption of Transcription Termination (DoTT), a virus-driven phenomenon which disables Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor (CPSF)-mediated 3' processing of nascent pre-mRNAs10-15. Mutant viruses lacking ICP27 or NS1, the virus-encoded proteins responsible for inhibiting CPSF and triggering DoTT13,15, failed to induce host cell Z-RNA accrual and were attenuated in their ability to stimulate ZBP1. Ectopic expression of HSV-1 ICP27 or IAV NS1, or pharmacological blockade of CPSF activity, induced accumulation of host cell Z-RNAs and activated ZBP1. These results demonstrate that DoTT-generated cellular Z-RNAs are bona fide ZBP1 ligands, and position ZBP1-activated cell death as a host response to counter viral disruption of the cellular transcriptional machinery.

If you're tired of staring a tiny laptop screen while working from home, consider scooping up our favorite desktop monitor for almost 25 percent off its normal price. The Dell 27 Plus 4K (8/10, WIRED Reivew) is currently marked down to just $228 on Amazon, the lowest we've seen yet for this smart and practical 4K screen.

You might be worried about poor panel quality or scarce features, considering the price point, but the Dell S2725QS is surprisingly well equipped for under $300. It has an IPS panel, which is one of the better non-OLED options, with thin bezels and a minimal stand that will fit right into any desk setup. It has 100 percent sRGB coverage, and 79 percent AdobeRGB, with good color accuracy to match, making it a nice choice for light creative work as well.

It also has a 120-Hz refresh rate, so while you may want to consider a dedicated screen for gaming, you can certainly jam some weekend Fortnite rounds. AMD FreeSync Premium will help keep things smooth, since reaching frame rates that high will be tough for most systems. You might find that even scrolling the web is much better with a higher refresh rate, though. I know I have trouble going back to 60 Hz.

Although it's a little short on ports, lacking any USB in particular, it is VESA compatible if you want to mount it or put it on a stand. It has internal speakers too, and our reviewer, Luke Larsen, was impressed with how they stack up against most built-in monitor speakers. That's not too tough considering they can often be thin and tinny, but it's a nice benefit for anyone lacking the desk space for a nicer, dedicated option.

Overall, the Dell 27 Plus 4K is an excellent value, which makes it easy to overlook some of the smaller inconveniences. If you want to spend more for something nicer, make sure to check out the full roundup of our favorite desktop monitors, but most people just looking for a second screen for their work laptop will be exceedingly happy with this Dell.

                                What happens here matters everywhere.                                


by Geof Wheelwright on Oct 13, 2025 at 7:30 amOctober 13, 2025 at 7:35 am

Gretchen Peri has been involved in helping governments around the world find better ways to use technology for more than two decades. For the last 14 years, she led the Global Public & Social Impact practice at Slalom Consulting. 

She is now bringing her international experience home to Washington state as the new CTO of Washington Technology Solutions (WaTech). 

WaTech was established in 2011 as Washington state's consolidated technology services agency. Pretty much wherever the state is using technology to deliver services, this agency is involved.

Peri is now working to implement an ambitious new strategic plan that she says is aimed at improving how Washington uses technology to serve residents. Peri is also the opening keynote speaker at the Bellevue Innovation Exchange Oct. 16 at Bellevue City Hall. 

GeekWire caught up with Peri to talk about how WaTech plans to use AI, cloud platforms, upgraded online services, and a cultural shift in focus to improve what it offers to state residents — and to do so at a time when state budgets are tight, and federal guidance and regulation around AI and tech is still evolving. The interview was edited for brevity and clarity.

GeekWire: What attracted you to this role? 

Peri: “I've spent the last 20 years of my career in management consulting, helping state and local governments leverage technology to better deliver on their business outcomes. At my previous firm, I led our global government education and nonprofit business. And as exciting as that was, I also found that I was making a small impact in a lot of different places. At this point in my career, I want to have a large impact in one place. That's what drew me to the state. And I'm so glad I'm here.”

GeekWire: What are your top three priorities as CTO?

Peri: “I'd say my three areas of focus are: 

From in line to online, we want to be able to deliver our services where people are, when they need it, and in whatever language they need to receive it in.”

GeekWire: The new 2025 IT strategic plan calls for the development of enterprise standards for emerging technologies, including AI, automation, and cloud platforms, to ensure security, equity, and appropriate use. How big a lift do you think that will be?

Peri: “One of the biggest lifts, I think, is actually cultural. Governments always design their services from how we operate, rather than thinking about how residents and customers actually need to receive our services. So it's that cultural shift that I think is going to be the most exciting transformation and probably the most work for us as we look to leverage emerging technologies, including AI, in the right way.

Another area where agencies are very interested in using new and emerging technologies is how we expose our enterprise knowledge base — with chatbots and other things that many jurisdictions are deploying right now. We've got very rich information but finding that information can be a challenge for our residents. So using our enterprise knowledge base to deliver the information to our residents is another area.

Computer vision is actually one of the really exciting areas, and we're seeing this as we look to do automated inspections to help keep our employees safe, or monitor the health of our natural environment. There are some really interesting AI use cases around identifying and monitoring the health of fish or different types of eelgrass in the Puget Sound and in our oceans. 

There's also conversational and translational AI. The technology has come to a point now where we are able to provide our content in hundreds of languages. And even in this area, we have groups, we have communities that speak unique languages. And so the advances in technology allow us to reach them and communicate with them much easier than it used to be.

Finally, (there is) agentic workflow. That's around automating our business operations at scale, starting with things that are straightforward and simple, like invoice matching or other types of things where we can make sure that we're validating the information, and then we can move on to the task at hand.”

GeekWire: It sounds like one of your biggest challenges might be around siloed information.

Peri: “Our problem is exactly like you said, we have silos within those departments that are managing their data. We actually have silos within law enforcement agencies, where they have their records management system and their dispatch system and their evidence management system. So bringing data together within agencies is our first challenge and then bringing data together from multiple agencies is going to be our second challenge.”

GeekWire: As you're trying to bring AI to all of this, it's more challenging if you have to send AI off to a whole bunch of different places.

Peri: “Exactly, and until we bring that data together, can we really identify and track the outcomes we're looking to generate? We can track outputs, how many people we're serving with this type of product or service, but we can't necessarily say that we're delivering a healthier population or a more resilient population. So that's the main focus of why we need to bring that data together to create a foundation upon which we can really start to measure those outcomes and move those levers.”

GeekWire: Federal guidance and regulations on AI and tech are still evolving. How do you plan to navigate uncertainty and evolution at the national level?

Peri: “I am still only one month in. (But it's about) leveraging the federal standards that have been in place for quite some time and making sure that we are providing our guidelines and regulations that match the culture of Washington and (how) we want to create a welcoming environment for everyone in this state. And that's about all I can say on the federal state discussion.”

GeekWire: Do the state's current budget challenges change what you need to do in the IT strategic plan?

Peri: “I think that in this budget constrained environment, it's even more important that we rely on our technology to be able to reach people who really need it right now and deliver services more digitally so that they can access them easier.”

GeekWire: If there's one thing you'd like Washington residents to be able to say a year from now about the services offered by WaTech, what would it be?

Peri: “I think of the quote: ‘I expect exceptional, but I'll settle for awesome'. When I look back, I want to be able to say that across the board when we get to interact with people at pivotal points in their lives, which we do as government, that we have provided exceptional customer service to them.”

Kiln, a co-working and flex-office community with locations in multiple western U.S. states, is opening its first space in Washington state next year.

The company confirmed a new lease of 32,276 feet in Seattle's Fremont Lake Union Center on North 34th Street. The opening is planned for fall 2026.

According to Kiln, the location will be able to accommodate more than 350 members in a neighborhood that is home to offices for nearby tech companies including Google, Tableau, Adobe and others.

Kiln will open reservations soon for a variety of membership types. Its workspaces include dedicated individual desks, shared desks, private offices, conference rooms and more, suitable for people working solo, larger teams and growing startups.

Amenities in other locations include bike storage, parenting rooms, phone booths, fully stocked kitchens, mail services, gym access, showers and more.

Based in Salt Lake City, Kiln will have 25 locations by the time Seattle opens. The next closest locations are in Portland and Bend, Ore.

Kiln will compete against a number of co-working companies in the Seattle area, including Portland-based Centrl Office, which took over a WeWork location in a historic building on Capitol Hill last year; and The Pioneer Collective, which is opening a new co-working space in a former fish cannery along the Lake Washington Ship Canal.

Seattle ranks No. 12 among U.S. cities as measured by total co-working square footage across 153 locations, according to CoworkingCafe, which noted that the broader sector is shifting to a “more measured and optimized footprint” after growing over the past two years.

A pilot electric ferry service between Seattle and nearby Tacoma could debut next summer to serve the surge of World Cup tourists expected in the region — but questions about funding, ferry terminal locations and total costs remain unanswered.

Pierce County leaders, whose jurisdiction includes Tacoma, are hoping the hydroplane ferry would boost tourism and provide a scenic connection to the city 35 miles south of Seattle — one that lasts well beyond the World Cup kickoff in June. They also envision job creation from building the zero-emission vessels in the area.

“This is an example of a legacy that we can leave this region that will promote tourism, promote economic development and promote movement around Puget Sound,” said Ryan Mello, executive of Pierce County, in a recent pitch to Port of Tacoma officials.

The hydroplane ferries would be the only water-based public transit linking Puget Sound's two largest cities.

Here's how the plan works:

“The vision of bringing back the ‘Mosquito Fleet‘ with this generation of boats is what we are hoping is the outcome of this pilot,” said Betty Baublits, Pierce County's economic development director, referencing the privately owned ships that ferried passengers in the region more than a century ago.

“We will evaluate the success of the pilot with all of our community, maritime and rider stakeholders to determine what the future of an electric foot ferry network in the Salish Sea will be, and who is the best entity to continue the program,” she added via email.

While the notion of sleek new hydroplanes zipping across the region's waterways is attractive, how the plan comes together is foggy under the compressed timeline.

Along with additional funding needed to set sail, the project must find ferry landing sites with parking and boarding ramps that meet accessibility needs and install charging facilities. Who pays for and owns the shore-side infrastructure depends on where it's located, Baublits said.

The county is also working on a revenue-sharing agreement with Prop, with the county proceeds reinvested into the electric ferry program. The parties have not said what the passenger fares would cost.

At the September meeting with the county and the Port of Tacoma, commissioners shared enthusiasm for the proposal, imagining a service between the city and other popular locales on Puget Sound. But there were also concerns about affordability for passengers.

“It is very luxurious inside one of these [ferries],” said Commissioner Kristin Ang. “So I do want to make it affordable for more people and inclusive … I get that this is the pilot project, but when I look at those leather seats, I'm just like, ‘Is this just for a certain class of people?'”

Others in the region are similarly interested in the proposal, which could bolster the connection between tech companies and organizations in Seattle and Tacoma. But the proposed speed of deployment remains a hurdle. 

“This is a big project. It's a big opportunity, and we need to give it the time necessary in order to be successful,” said Dennis Joyce, director of investments for Tacoma Venture Fund (TVF), a venture capital firm. Tying the launch to the World Cup, he added, “is a really short time horizon.”

Existing rapid and mass transit options between Seattle and Tacoma include Sound Transit's commuter railway service and its express buses.

The ferry trip will take about 50-55 minutes each way, which is longer than driving between the cities on Interstate 5, though freeway traffic is a wildcard. 

There are other efforts underway to deploy electric-powered vessels in Western Washington:

Nearly a decade ago, real estate company Seco Development proposed a pilot ferry service to carry passengers across Lake Washington, between Seattle's tech-heavy South Lake Union neighborhood and a Seco office development in Renton. The development is now mired in bankruptcy.

Part of the challenge for these projects stems from federal laws including the 1920 Jones Act and the Passenger Vessel Services Act of 1886 that require the use of domestically made vessels for carrying goods, cars and passengers for domestic, waterborne transportation. The rules eliminate the option of purchasing less costly European-made ferries.

Artemis is building its hydrofoils in Belfast and in February announced a manufacturing partnership with the Seattle-based luxury yacht maker Delta Marine. 

David Tyler, Artemis co-founder and managing director for North America, declined to share details on where vessels for the Tacoma-area project would be built, what they would cost, and when they would be available, saying via email that was “currently commercially sensitive information.”

Tyler said that additional manufacturing locations beyond the Seattle site would be “announced soon.”

Pierce County Executive Mello said the region has long wanted to bolster its ferry service options — and now is the chance. 

“Hosting such a significant world event,” he said, “causes some sense of urgency and helps cause some creativity about how can we take advantage of this moment for the benefit of the people who live here … and the businesses who have the responsibility of providing jobs and economic vitality for this region long after the games are gone.”

Goldman Sachs has agreed to acquire Industry Ventures, a 25-year-old, San Francisco-based investment firm with $7 billion in assets under management, CNBC was first to report on Monday. The deal underscores the growing importance of secondary markets and buyouts as traditional venture exits remain sluggish.

The investment bank is paying $665 million in cash and equity, with up to $300 million more tied to the firm's performance through 2030, according to a release from Goldman. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of next year, and all 45 Industry Ventures employees are expected to join Goldman.

We've reached out to Swildens for more information.

The acquisition comes as venture funds increasingly turn to non-traditional exits amid a prolonged IPO drought that only now looks to be breaking. Speaking on TechCrunch's StrictlyVC Download podcast earlier this year, Industry Ventures founder and CEO Hans Swildens said that tech buyout funds now account for 25% of all liquidity in the entire venture ecosystem — “a huge chunk of liquidity,” he said.

Swildens explained that venture managers are being forced to adapt their approach. “Just going out and seeing companies, putting them in your fund and then waiting for an IPO or strategic M&A exit probably won't work anymore,” he said in the podcast interview. “[VCs] need to start working on alternative liquidity solutions.”

At the time — in April — he noted that at least five major venture funds had hired full-time staff dedicated to manufacturing non-traditional exits, including secondary transactions, continuation funds, and buyouts. “All the brand name funds are all staffing and thinking through liquidity structures,” Swildens said.

Goldman is making the acquisition to bolster its $540 billion alternatives investment platform, which the bank has identified as a key growth engine.

“Industry Ventures' trusted relationships and venture capital expertise complement our existing investing franchises and expand opportunities for clients to access the fastest growing companies and sectors in the world,” Goldman CEO David Solomon said in a prepared statement. “By combining the global resources of Goldman Sachs with the venture capital expertise of Industry Ventures, we are uniquely positioned to serve the increasingly complex needs of entrepreneurs, private technology companies, limited partners, and venture fund managers,” the statement continued.

Industry Ventures says it has made more than 1,000 investments, has stakes in more than 700 venture firms, and that it boasts an internal rate of return of 18%.

Grindr's majority owners are scrambling to take the LGBTQ+ dating app private after a stock decline triggered a personal financial crisis, according to a report from Semafor.

The owners in question are Raymond Zage, a former hedge fund manager and U.S. expat now based in Singapore, and James Lu, a Chinese-American entrepreneur and former Amazon and Baidu exec. Together they led the 2020 acquisition of Grindr from Chinese ownership for over $600 million, then took the app public in 2022 through a blank-check merger.

Reportedly, Zage and Lu, who together control more than 60% of Grindr, pledged nearly all their shares as collateral for personal loans from a unit of Singapore's sovereign wealth fund Temasek. After Grindr began a slide at the end of September, those loans became undercollateralized (worth less than the debt), so the Temasek unit seized and sold some of the shares last week.

Grindr's stock slide appears disconnected from business fundamentals – profits were up 25% in the second quarter, Semafor notes, though it has seen some executive turnover; there has been some investor concern about narrowing margins, too.

Either way, the pair are now said to be in talks with Fortress Investment Group – itself now majority owned by Mubadala Investment Company, which is itself owned by the government of Abu Dhabi – to secure financing for a buyout at around $15 per share, which would value Grindr at around $3 billion. Shares jumped following the report.

I was asked to write up such a document for an incident where our team had written a new feature which, upon launch, did absolutely nothing. Our team had accidentally mistyped a flag name on the last day before we handed it to a test team, the test team examined the (nonfunctional) tool for a few weeks and blessed it, and then upon turning it on, it failed to do anything. My five whys document was most about ""what part of our process led to a multiweek test effort that would greenlight a tool that does nothing that it is required to do.""I recall my manager handing the doc back to me and saying that I needed to completely redo it because it was unacceptable for us to blame another team for our team's bug, which is how I learned that you can make a five why process blame any team you find convenient by choosing the question. I quit not too long after that.

This was and is torture to me. I'm not going to fuck something up on purpose just to make the paperwork look good if I can tell ten minutes in that this is a stupid way to do it and I should be doing something else first.

An inflexible timeline is a constraint that is often valid -- e.g. if you have to launch a product meant for classrooms before the school year begins.So then the real question becomes, why wasn't work scoped accordingly? Why weren't features simplified or removed once it became clear there wouldn't be time to deliver them all working correctly? There's a failure of process there that is the root cause.Similarly, with ""incentives are misaligned"", that's fuzzy. A real root cause might be around managing time spent on bugfixes vs new feature, and the root cause is not dedicating enough time to bugfixes, and if that's because people aren't being promoted for those, it's about fixing the promotion process in a concrete way.You can't usually just stop at fuzzy cultural/management things because you want to blame others.

If you do this, know that there be dragons. You have to be very careful here, because for any sufficiently large company, misaligned incentives are largely defined by the org chart and it's boudaries. You will be adding fuel to politics that is likely above your pay grade, and the fallout can be career changing. I was lucky to have a neutral reputation, as someine who cared more about the product than personal gain. So I got a lot of leeway when I said tonedeaf things. Even still I ended up in crosshairs once or twice in the 10 years I was at the company for having opinions about systemic problems.

Fwiw, if I were your manager performing a root cause analysis, I'd mostly expect my team to be identifying contributing factors within their domain, and then we'd collate and analyze the factors with other respective teams to drill down to the root causes. I'd also have kicked back a doc that was mostly about blaming the other team.

reply

Agreed. If the test team messed up, then you need to answer the ""why"" your team didn't verify that the testing had actually been done. (And also why the team hadn't verified that the tool they'd sent to testing was even minimally functional to begin with.)Five whys are necessarily scoped to a set of people responsible. For things that happen outside that scope, the whys become about selection and verification.

Validating that the build you produced works at all should be done by you, but there's also a whole team whose job it was to validate it; would you advocate for another team to test the testing teams tests?And more to the point, how do you write a 5 why's that explains how you'd typo'd a flag to turn a feature on, and another team validated that the feature worked?

Seriously? Even without knowing any context, there's a handful of universal best practices that had to Swiss cheese fail for this to even get handed off to devtest…- Why are you adding/changing feature flag changes the day before handoff? Is there process for development freeze before handoff, e.g. only showstopper changes are made after freeze? Yes but aales asked for it so they could demo at a conference. Why don't we have special build/deployment pipeline for experimental features that our sales / marketing engineers are asking for?- Was it tested be developer before pushing? Yes - why did succeed at that point and fail in prod? Environment was different. Why do we not have dev environment that matches prod? Money? Time? Politics?- Was it code reviewed? Did it get an actual review, or rubber stamped? Reviewed, but skimmed important parts only — Why was it not reviewed more carefully? Not enough time — why is there not enough time to do code reviews? 
Oh, the feature flag name used underscore instead of hyphen — why did this not get flagged by style checker? Oh, so there's no clear style conventions for feature flags and each team does their own thing…? Interesting…Etc etc.

It doesn't take a whole team. There are lots of mechanisms to produce that evidence. This is just how it works. If two checks aren't sufficient, it becomes three. Or four. Until problems stop making it through.

I should also have stated that based on the context I assumed this was talking about in incident report meant to be consumed internally, which I believe should be one per team. Incident reports published externally should be one single document, combining all the RCA from each individual report.

reply

Otherwise when an airplane crashes because of a defect in the aluminum, the design team's RCA will have to conclude that the root cause is ""a lack of a redundant set of wings in the plane design"", because they don't want to pin the blame on the materials quality inspection team mixing up some batch numbers.If you were relying on something not to fail and it failed, your RCA should state as much. At best in the GP's case they could say ""it's our fault for trusting the testing team to test the feature"".

The idea that if it was obvious another team messed up, you'd just ignore the problem until it got audited by a cross-functional team. All of the time and effort and materials spent between the two being wasted because nobody spoke up.

This is a classic ""limit the scope of the feature.""  You want the document to be written and constrained to someone that is in a position to impact everything they talk about.  If you think there was something more holistic, push for that, as well.Note you can discuss what other teams are doing.  But do that in a way that is strictly factual.  And then ask why that led your team to the failure that your team owns.

A few problems I faced:- culturally a lack of deeper understanding or care around “safety” topics. Forces that be inherently are motivated by launching features and increasing sales, so more often than not you could write an awesome incident retro doc and just get people who are laser focused on the bare minimum of action items.- security folks co-opting the safety things, because removing access to things can be misconstrued to mean making things safer. While somewhat true, it also makes doing jobs more difficult if not replaced with adequate tooling. What this meant was taking away access and replacing everything with “break glass” mechanisms. If your team is breaking glass every day and ticketing security, you're probably failing to address both security and safety..- related to the last point, but a lack of introspection as to the means of making changes which led to the incident. For example: user uses ssh to run a command and ran the wrong command -> we should eliminate ssh. Rather than asking why was ssh the best / only way the user could affect change to the system? Could we build an api for this with tooling and safeguards before cutting off ssh?

When you move thinking about reliability or safety outside of the teams that generate the problems, you replace self reflection with scolding, and you have to either cajole people to make changes for you or jump into code you're not spending enough time with to truly understand. And then if you make a mistake this is evidence that you shouldn't be touching it at all. See we told you this would end badly.

They're both flawed but often replace something that works 3x worse than my caricature of both.The findings should always result in a material change that is worth at least the effort of having done it. Not just a checkbox that proves we did something. The investment in the mitigation should honor the consequences of the failure, and the uniqueness of the failure. Or rather, the lack of uniqueness. As a failure repeats in kind (eg, a bunch of 737 Maxes crashing), trust that the system is put in jeopardy. By the time a problem has happened three times, the response should begin to resemble penance.So how do we get the problem not to hit production again, or how do we at least keep it happening due to the exact same error?And for some failure modes, we need to project the consequences going forward. Let's say you find your app is occasionally crashing over a weekend because of memory leaks, plus the lack of Continuous Deployment forcibly restarting the services. We can predict this problem will happen reliably on Memorial Day, and Labor Day. So we need to do something relatively serious now.But it'll also get much worse on Thanksgiving weekend, and just stupid around Christmas, when we have code freezes. So we do something to get us through Memorial Day but we also need a second story near the top of the backlog that needs to be done by Labor Day, Thanksgiving at the latest. But we don't necessarily have to do that story next sprint.

Any RCA that doesn't provide useful feedback to management up and down the chain is missing pieces, but there's lots of discussion elsewhere in this thread about that by people better at elaborating than I am.

That is sort of how Agile got out there in the first place. Open feedback loops letting management be stupid for so long before the consequences were apparent that they could duck their vast contributions to it.

Before that I hated it when people confessed to me that they knew a problem was going to happen and they did nothing to stop it. But the problem with doing things right the first time is that nobody appreciates how hard it is. You spend all your political capital trying to stop the company from making a mistake it desperately wants to make. You get no credit when it doesn't happen because they already figured it wouldn't. And you don't get any buy-in for keeping it from repeating in the future. So now you have this plate you have to spin all by yourself, and nobody who can hand your more control gives a shit other than the fact that you seem like an asshole so we aren't going to promote you.

There were tools I wrote at my last job because basically an incident could IMO be tracked back to, ""I was on step 5 and George interrupted me to ask a question of some other high priority effort, and when I got back I forgot to finish step 5"". The more familiar you are with a runbook, the more your brain will confuse memories from an hour or a day ago with memories of the same routine at a different time.It's literally ""did I turn off the stove"". You remember turning off the stove. Many, many times. But did you turn off both burners you turned on for lunch? You're certain about one. But what about the other? That's a blur.But we're software developers. The more mundane a task, the more likely that we can replace it with a program to do the same thing. And as you get more familiar with the task you keep adding more to the automatic parts until one day it's just a couple buttons that can be reliably pushed during peak traffic on your services. Just make sure there isn't an active outage going on when you push the buttons.

Systems do not have to facilitate operators in building accurate mental models. In fact, safe systems disregard mental models, because a mental model is a human thing, and humans are fallible. Remove the human and you have a safer system.Safety is not a dynamic control problem, it's a quality-state management problem. You need to maintain a state of quality assurance/quality control to ensure safety. When it falters, so does safety. Dynamism is sometimes not a factor (although when it is, it's typically a harmful factor).Also fwiw, there's often not a root cause, but instead multiple causes (or coincidental states). For getting better at tracking down causes of failures (and preventing them),  I recommend learning the Toyota Production System, then reading Out Of The Crisis. That'll kickstart your brain enough to be more effective than 99.99% of people.

1) (Mainly) the huge increase in upstream capacity of residential broadband connections with FTTH. It's not uncommon for homes to have 2gbit/sec up now and certainly 1gbit/sec is fairly commonplace, which is an enormous amount of bandwidth compared to many interconnects. 10, 40 and 100gbit/sec are the most common and a handful of users can totally saturate these.2) Many more powerful IoT devices that can handle this level of attack outbound.

Null routing is usually applied to the targets of the attack, not the sources. If one of your IPs is getting attacked, you null route it, so upstream routers drop traffic instead of sending it to you.

How about we actually finally roll out IPv6 and bury CGNAT in the graveyard where it belongs?Suddenly, everybody (ISPs, carriers, end users) can blackhole a compromised IP and/or IP range without affecting non-compromised endpoints.And DDoS goes poof.  And, as a bonus, we get the end to end nature of the internet back again.

Almost all of the DDoS mitigation providers have been  struggling for a few weeks because they just don't have enough edge capacity.And normal hosting companies that are not focused on DDoS mitigation also seem to have had issues, but with less impact to other customers as they'll just blackhole addresses under larger attacks. For example, I've seen all connections to / from some of my services at Hetzner time out way more frequently than usual, and some at OVH too. Then one of my smaller hosting providers got hit with an attack of at least 1 Tbps which saturated a bunch of their transit links.Cloudflare and maybe a couple of the other enterprise providers (Gcore?) operate at a large enough scale to handle these attacks, but all the smaller ones (who tend to have more affordable rates and more application-specific filters for sensitive applications that can't deal with much leakage) seem to be in quite a bad spot right now. Cloudflare Magic Transit pricing supposedly starts at around $4k / month, and it would really suck if that became the floor for being able to run a non-HTTP service online.Something like Team Cymru's UTRS service (with Flowspec support) could potentially help to mitigate attacks at the source, but residential ISPs and maybe the T1s would need to join it, and I don't see that happening anytime soon.

It seems like this whole insecure-IoT-device thing would probably dry up pretty quickly if people's internet was cut off when one was detected.  They can then turn around and lambast / sue / etc the company that sold it, putting pressure on the source of the problem.  Right now there's no reason for sellers to do anything at all to ensure security, afaict.So... not actually arguing in favor of it, but definitely curious about any stated ISP / core networking system's stated reasons.

Or this:>“The crying need for effective and universal outbound DDoS attack suppression is something that is really being highlighted by these recent attacks,” Dobbins continued. “A lot of network operators are learning that lesson now, and there's going to be a period ahead where there's some scrambling and potential disruption going on.”Uh.  No.  That's gross negligence if they are only starting to think about it now - the trend has been clear for over a decade, and the IoT threat has been obvious since day 1 and even blasted over public news for the past few years.  Their status is pretty much only one of: incompetent, malicious, or they have had plans but haven't acted on them fast enough or strongly enough for [some reason], and that reason isn't something I've seen.  Surprises happen, prevention costs money and time, and there are plenty of reasons why everyone isn't already prepared for everything, so I think ""incompetent or malicious"" is pretty rare.... but what are those reasons?

So why hasn't that happened?  These are clearly damaging to many, and ISPs are apparently doing next to nothing to prevent it, and it has been extremely clear for a while now that it's going to just become a bigger and bigger problem.

When I ran a large web site that attracted lots of DDoS, it didn't really seem worthwhile to track down the source and try to contact ISPs. I had done a lot of trying to track and stop people sending phishing mail under our name, and it's simply too much work to write a reasonable abuse report that is unlikely to be followed up on. With email, mostly people seem to accept the Received headers are probably true; with DDoS, you'd be sending them pcaps, and they'd be telling you it's probably spoofed, and unless I've got lots of peering, I'm not going to be able to get captures that are convincing... so just do my best to manage the inbound and call it a day.

Or just unplug the culprit. But the key seems to be that the device continues working. Ideally you would just shutdown or disconnect the device. If fridge is infected, the fridge can still fridge, but it no longer has internet privileges.

I can't wait for all of them to switch to IOS-ified devices incapable of installing alternative operating systems or programs, as that would be the inevitable end solution for all these manufacturers if this was implemented.

Even if the device removed the capability for passwords and used key based authentication, connecting it directly to the internet means if there's ever a vulnerability, all that was for naught anyway.

This story was originally published by ProPublica.

ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.

Nevada state regulators have accused Elon Musk's Boring Co. of violating environmental regulations nearly 800 times in the last two years as it digs a sprawling tunnel network beneath Las Vegas for its Tesla-powered “people mover.” The company's alleged violations include starting to dig without approval, releasing untreated water onto city streets and spilling muck from its trucks, according to a new document obtained by City Cast Las Vegas and ProPublica.

The Sept. 22 cease-and-desist letter from the state Bureau of Water Pollution Control alleged repeated violations of a settlement agreement that the company had entered into after being fined five years ago for discharging groundwater into storm drains without a permit. That agreement, signed by a Boring executive in 2022, was intended to compel the company to comply with state water pollution laws.

Instead, state inspectors documented nearly 100 alleged new violations of the agreement. The letter also accuses the company of failing to hire an independent environmental manager to regularly inspect its construction sites. State regulators counted 689 missed inspections.

The Boring Co. is disputing the violation letter, a state spokesperson said.

The Nevada Division of Environmental Protection could have fined the company more than $3 million under the 2022 agreement, which allowed for daily penalties to be assessed. But regulators knocked down the total penalty to $242,800. For example, the bulk of the total possible fine was linked to the alleged missed inspections, but the agency chose to levy just a $10,000 penalty for each of the company's 11 permits.

“Given the extraordinary number of violations, NDEP has decided to exercise its discretion to reduce the penalty to two $5,000 violations per permit, which it believes offers a reasonable penalty that will still serve to deter future non-compliance conduct,” regulators wrote in the letter.

Payment of the penalty isn't required until after the dispute resolution process is complete, a state spokesperson said. In the letter, the agency reminded the company that it “reserves the right to direct TBC to cease and desist construction activities” under the agreement.

In the past, Musk has espoused paying penalties rather than waiting for approvals as a way of doing business.

​​“Environmental regulations are, in my view, largely terrible,” he said at an event with the libertarian Cato Institute last year. “You have to get permission in advance, as opposed to, say, paying a penalty if you do something wrong, which I think would be much more effective.”

Neither Musk nor Boring responded to requests for comment for this story.

The Sept. 22 letter documents the latest in a string of alleged violations of state and local regulations by The Boring Co. since it began construction in 2019 of the Loop project, which uses driver-operated Teslas to move people through the tunnels. The project, initially a 0.8-mile underground route connecting the sections of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority campus to each other, has grown to a planned 68 miles of tunnels and 104 stations across the Las Vegas Valley. It's carried out in partnership with the LVCVA, the tourism board best known for the “What Happens Here, Stays Here” slogan.

Boring uses a machine known as Prufrock to dig the 12-foot-diameter tunnels, applying chemical accelerants as part of the process. For each foot the company bores, it removes about 6 cubic yards of soil along with any groundwater, according to a company document prepared for state environmental officials.

Because it is privately funded and receives no federal money, the project is exempt from many exhaustive governmental vetting and environmental analysis requirements. But it is required to obtain state permits to ensure the waste does not contaminate the environment or local water sources.

A January story by ProPublica and City Cast Las Vegas documented how the company worked to escape county and state oversight requirements by arguing its project didn't fit under existing regulations and promising to hold itself accountable through independent audits — all while being cited for permitting and water pollution violations in 2019, 2021, 2022 and 2023. Last year, the company successfully lobbied to be exempted from holding a county “amusement and transportation system” permit, arguing instead for an oversight plan that removed multiple layers of inspection.

Workers have complained of chemical burns from the waste material generated by the tunneling process, and firefighters must decontaminate their equipment after conducting rescues from the project sites. The company was fined more than $112,000 by Nevada's Occupational Safety and Health Administration in late 2023 after workers complained of “ankle-deep” water in the tunnels, muck spills and burns. The Boring Co. has contested the violations. Just last month, a construction worker suffered a “crush injury” after being pinned between two 4,000-foot pipes, according to police records. Firefighters used a crane to extract him from the tunnel opening.

After ProPublica and City Cast Las Vegas published their January story, both the CEO and the chairman of the LVCVA board criticized the reporting, arguing the project is well-regulated. As an example, LVCVA CEO Steve Hill cited the delayed opening of a Loop station by local officials who were concerned that fire safety requirements weren't adequate. Board chair Jim Gibson, who is also a Clark County commissioner, agreed the project is appropriately regulated.

“We wouldn't have given approvals if we determined things weren't the way they ought to be and what it needs to be for public safety reasons,” Gibson said, according to the Las Vegas Review Journal. “Our sense is we've done what we need to do to protect the public.”

Asked for a response to the new proposed fines, an LVCVA spokesperson said, “We won't be participating in this story.”

The repeated allegations that the company is violating regulations — including the bespoke regulatory arrangement agreed to by the company — indicates that officials aren't keeping the public safe, said Ben Leffel, an assistant public policy professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

“Not if they're recommitting almost the exact violation,” Leffel said.

Leffel questioned whether a $250,000 penalty would be significant enough to change operations at The Boring Co., which was valued at $7 billion in 2023. Studies show that fines that don't put a significant dent in a company's profit don't deter companies from future violations, Leffel said.

A state spokesperson disagreed that regulators aren't keeping the public safe and said the agency believes its penalties will deter “future non-compliance.”

“NDEP is actively monitoring and inspecting the projects,” the spokesperson said.

Humbird 3 comes with all the bells and whistles.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The Humbird 3, an innovative 11-in-1 Thunderbolt 5 eGPU dock, aims to become the only docking station you'll ever need. With support from over 177 backers on Kickstarter and more than $63,000 raised, it's more than just an eGPU dock—it's loaded with a wide range of valuable features.

The dock is constructed from recycled aluminum with a wooden accent, thereby enhancing its premium appearance. It also incorporates a cooling system that operates in a silent 0dB mode when idle and dynamically adjusts its fan speed based on the graphics card's load. According to the manufacturer, the Humbird 3 is equipped with an ESP32 System on Chip (SoC), a component typically utilized in Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and is reportedly powered by the Humbird Operating System (OS) to manage the device's power and performance. The Humbird 3 also features a one-inch LCD screen that displays real-time information, including power consumption, transfer speed, charging status, or a user-defined parameter.

The device utilizes Intel's HL9480 Thunderbolt 5 controller, capable of delivering up to 120 Gbps in single-display mode. The PCIe 4.0 x16 expansion slot is configured as a x4 connection with a bandwidth of 64 Gbps. The dock is equipped with an integrated 500W GaN power supply and a 16-pin power connector designed to supply power to your graphics card. Users may employ either a standard 16-pin power cable or a 16-pin to 3 x 8-pin power cable, depending on their requirements. Rated at 500W, the system supports graphics cards up to the Radeon 9070 XT or the GeForce RTX 5080.

The Humbird 3 exhibits a comprehensive array of features. Concerning storage, it includes one M.2 slot operating at PCIe 4.0 x4; however, the vendor did not specify the supported form factors. Additionally, it incorporates a microSD card reader as well as CFexpress Type A and Type B card readers. In terms of network connectivity, the Humbird 3 is equipped with a single 5G Ethernet port, facilitated by the Realtek RTL8157 controller.

Connectivity includes three Thunderbolt 5 ports that support 100W PD charging. Additionally, the DisplayPort 2.1 output delivers 8K (7680 x 4320) resolution at a refresh rate of up to 60 Hz. The device is also equipped with two standard USB Type-A ports offering 10 Gbps data transfer speeds. Furthermore, wireless charging functionality is available, facilitating the charging of smartphones or smartwatches.

The Humbird 3 is equipped with a standard 180W power adapter. Nonetheless, it is possible to upgrade to a 300W unit for an additional $39 or to a 500W GaN power adapter for an extra $129.

The funding period for the Humbird 3 has concluded. The manufacturer has established an MSRP of $399 for the device. However, Super Early Bird and Early Bird backers are eligible to purchase the device at prices of $299 and $309, respectively. Meanwhile, the vendor is offering a ""KS discount"" of $80, reducing the device's price to $319.

In clinically stable patients with suspected or confirmed infective endocarditis (IE), deferring antimicrobial treatment until blood culture results were available was not associated with 30-day mortality or worse clinical outcomes compared with immediate antimicrobial treatment.

""[The study] findings advocate for a careful, patient-centered approach to initiating AT [antimicrobial treatment] in clinically stable patients with suspected IE, particularly in cases with diagnostic uncertainty helping to avoid unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Elisavet Stavropoulou, Infectious Diseases Service, Lausanne University Hospital and University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland. It was published online on October 07, 2025, in Open Forum Infectious Diseases.

This study was conducted in a single healthcare system, and because the identification of rapid species relied on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time of flight, the findings may not be applicable to other settings. Selection bias was present, and residual confounding from unmeasured variables cannot be ruled out. Additionally, regional differences in clinical practice and antimicrobial stewardship policies may have affected the results.

This study received support through grants from the Swiss National Science Foundation, Swiss Heart Foundation, and Vaudois Foundation for Interventional Cardiology. The authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process. Human editors reviewed this content before publication.

Kiwifruits, rye bread and high mineral-content water could all help alleviate chronic constipation.

That's according to the first ever evidence-based dietary guidelines for adults with chronic constipation, led by researchers at King's College London.

The new guidelines also show that taking psyllium fibre supplements, certain probiotic strains and magnesium oxide supplements can help to improve constipation.

In contrast, other widely recommended approaches, including generic ""high-fibre diets,"" and senna supplements (a type of laxative) were found to lack strong evidence of effectiveness.

The guidelines, jointly published in two international journals, the Journal of Human Nutrition & Dietetics and Neurogastroenterology & Motility, are endorsed by the British Dietetic Association (BDA) and aim to transform the way this common condition is managed by doctors, nurses and dietitians in clinical practice. The guidelines could also allow better self-management of symptoms, particularly through foods and drinks.

Constipation is a long-term condition that significantly impacts quality of life and places a considerable financial burden on both patients and healthcare systems. Until now, clinical guidelines have offered only limited and sometimes outdated dietary recommendations, typically increasing dietary fibre and fluid intake.

Unlike previous guidelines, the new recommendations are based on numerous rigorous systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and applying the GRADE framework to assess the quality of the evidence. A multidisciplinary panel of experts, including dietitians, and a nutritionist, gastroenterologist, gut physiologist, and GP, reviewed over 75 clinical trials to create 59 recommendation statements and identify 12 research priorities.

Chronic constipation can have a huge impact on someone's day-to-day life. For the first time, we've provided direction on what dietary approaches could genuinely help, and which diet advice lacks evidence. Being able to improve this condition through dietary changes would allow people to self-manage their symptoms more and, hopefully, improve their quality of life.""

Dr. Eirini Dimidi, Reader in Nutritional Sciences at King's College London and lead author

The recommendations also focus on constipation outcomes such as stool frequency, stool consistency, straining and quality of life, making them more practical for personalised care based on the specific symptoms each individual experiences. A clinician-friendly tool has also been developed to support the adoption of these guidelines in everyday practice across the world.

The evidence review revealed that, while some foods and supplements are effective, the overall quality of existing studies is low. Most trials focused narrowly on single interventions rather than whole diet approaches, highlighting the urgent need for better nutrition research in constipation management.

Dr. Dimidi added: ""Eating a high fibre diet offers many benefits to overall health and has been a go-to recommendation for constipation. However, our guidelines found that there simply isn't enough evidence to suggest it actually works in constipation specifically. Instead, our research reveals some new dietary strategies that could indeed help patients. At the same time, we urgently need more high-quality trials to strengthen the evidence on what works and what doesn't.""

Professor Kevin Whelan, senior author and Professor of Dietetics at King's College London, said: ""This new guidance marks a promising step towards empowering health professionals and their patients to manage constipation through diet. This means that from now on that people suffering from constipation across the world can now receive up-to-date advice based upon the best available evidence in order to improve their symptoms and wellbeing. With continued research, it holds real potential to drive lasting improvements in quality of life.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study offers new models for understanding the causes of chemo brain","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251013/Study-offers-new-models-for-studying-causes-of-chemo-brain.aspx","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 12:05:00 GMT","

Cancer is a challenging enough diagnosis, but many patients are dealt a second blow, even as they heal: ""chemo brain.""

Also called ""brain fog,"" this mix of cognitive issues - memory problems, struggling to find words, an inability to concentrate - affects up to three-in-four cancer patients, according to multiple studies. For many, the effects last years beyond cancer treatment.

A new study offers new models for studying causes of chemo brain and points to the effects of chemotherapy drugs on the brain's lymphatic system, which is a network of tiny vessels in the brain's protective membranes that help remove waste and transport immune cells. The study was published Oct. 13 in Communications Biology.

There's compounding evidence now that these meningeal lymphatics are involved in cognitive issues, including Alzheimer's disease and traumatic brain injury, too. Women are affected by chemo brain, or brain fog, much more than men when treated by very common chemotherapies, such as those used on breast cancer patients on a regular basis.""

Jennifer Munson, co-corresponding author, professor and director of the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC's Cancer Research Center in Roanoke

The study highlights considerations for cancer treatment beyond eradicating the cancer itself, said Monet Roberts, an assistant professor of biomedical engineering and co-corresponding author on the paper. 

""Our study is important because it explores a very real, hidden layer of chemotherapy treatment that leaves lasting scars on the daily lives of those who are living with or have survived in their cancer journey,"" said Roberts, a former postdoctoral associate who trained in Munson's lab at the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute and now continues to study the lymphatic system in her own lab.

Munson and her team developed a three-tiered modeling system, using a combination of mouse and tissue-engineered models, to study changes to the lymphatic system. The in vitro model is the first human tissue engineered system that replicates this unique tissue, and has the potential for therapeutic testing, patient specific analyses, and disease-specific incorporation. 

The study examined effects of two of the most common chemotherapy drugs, docetaxel and carboplatin. While both showed lymphatic system impacts, they were much more pronounced with docetaxel.

""What we see is a shrinking of the lymphatic vessels, and fewer loops or branches in the vessels,"" said Munson, who is also a professor in Virginia Tech's Department of Biomedical Engineering and Mechanics. ""These are signs of reduced growth that indicate the lymphatics are changing, or not regenerating in beneficial ways. Lymphatic health really declined across all three models measured in different ways.""

As anticipated, brain imaging showed reduced drainage of the lymphatic system in mice. When the research team performed cognitive tests, they found that if a mouse had been treated with docetaxel, it exhibited poor memory.

Taken together, Munson said, the results suggest chemo brain could result from poor lymphatic-system drainage in response to chemotherapy. 

""That could potentially account for some of these memory deficits, which is similar to what we have seen in Alzheimer's disease,"" Munson said. 

""The first step is knowing,"" she said. ""And now the hope is to figure out how to help. Could delivering something pharmaceutically, such as a protein, alleviate the problem and not interfere with the chemotherapy? We know of other things that affect flow in the brain, as well, such as better sleep and exercise.""

Munson is also interested in exploring gender differences in chemo brain prevalence. 

""Lymphatic diseases in general affect women more than men,"" she said. ""We are extremely interested in trying to understand that difference and why that difference might exist.""

""Ultimately, this work underscores the need to consider not only survival, but also the long-term, often overlooked neurological side effects of cancer treatment on cognitive well-being and quality of life,"" Roberts said, ""Especially in women who are disproportionately affected by these lasting side effects.""

The U.S. men's national team is looking for a win to round out October.

Friday's outing against Ecuador resulted in a 1-1 draw, as veteran striker Enner Valencia outmaneuvered Chris Richards to open the scoring in the first half before Folarin Balogun rescued a draw with his second-half finish.

Ecuador did not have stars Moises Caicedo and Piero Hincapie, though the U.S. also is dealing with injury issues as Christian Pulisic, among others, was not deemed fit enough to start.

There is hope that Pulisic and Co. can get in some minutes, though starting left-back Antonee Robinson will not play again, despite being called up, due to an ongoing knee issue.

Next up for the U.S. is Australia, which is ranked No. 25 in the world by FIFA, one spot behind Ecuador. The U.S. is at No. 16, so the Socceroos will provide another test as they have qualified for the 2026 World Cup.

Unlike Ecuador, Australia doesn't have many notable names at top clubs, but there are some promising young players hoping to take that next step.

Following the October break, the U.S. will face off against fellow World Cup-qualified teams in Paraguay and Uruguay in November, the last set of senior international games on the calendar until March.

Here's everything to know to catch the U.S.-Australia friendly:



The U.S. and Australia will meet on Tuesday, Oct. 14.

Kickoff is set for 9 p.m. ET/6 p.m. PT.

Dick's Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City, Colorado, home of the MLS' Rapids, is the venue for the game.

The U.S. and Australia have only met three times, all in international friendlies. The U.S. is 1-1-1 in those fixtures, the last being a 3-1 win on June 5, 2010.

The game will be broadcast in English on TNT. NBC's Universo will carry the game in Spanish.

HBO Max will stream the game in English, while Peacock will stream it in Spanish.

U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino brought in more familiar faces than the September squad that received criticism, though the overall quality is still lacking due to injuries and other omissions.

The Socceroos, as aforementioned, don't have any bonafide names. Goalie Maty Ryan has experience with notable European clubs, while left-back Jordy Bos, center-back Alessandro Circati and winger Nestory Irankunda are the nation's most promising talents currently.

Commerce City, CO – The U.S. Men's National Team will host Australia for a friendly tomorrow at DICK's Sporting Goods Park. Kickoff is scheduled for 7 p.m. MT. The Yanks are coming off a meh 1-1 result against Ecuador last Friday. The fanbase continues to be underwhelmed going into a home World Cup next summer. Head Coach Mauricio Pochettino and the players are preaching progress. 

“There were opportunities for us to be ruthless. When you're playing against top sides, you concede half a chance and it's a goal. We can just brush up on the defensive mistakes, continue to create and be more clinical, we'll be a strong side,” said forward Florian Balogun of the Ecuador game. 

Poch on Zack Steffen not getting called in:Zack we know well. He's on a radar. It's about performance and fitness. He was unlucky in past camps. If he preforms, he will have a chance.

Poch has gone back and forth between a back four and a back five in recent camps. Three center backs has given them more defensive cover but there are questions about depth at the position outside of Chris Richards. Veteran glue guy Cristian Roldan likes it: 

“It suits our team overall as well. Three center backs, even a center back playing at right back, building in a three, allowing our midfielders to step a little bit higher and get our two 10s in the pockets, it suits us a whole lot better. 

“That allows the two center mids to be more aggressive, even man oriented. In a four, you have one guy further up the field. Once you're broken down, you got to recover.”

“They already know when we play in one or another shape, the way that we play. The most important things is the communication. We need to be ready to build from back and find good lines of the pass. Visualize. Have this flexibility and capacity. I think they (the center backs called into this camp) have the quality,” said Pochettino. 

They'll look to build out of the back and go at a more defensive Australia, who will look to counter attack. How the USMNT balances playing on the front foot against deferential opponents while ramping up for going toe-to-toe with bigger nations they will meet in a knockout game continues to be a question. 

Poch has worried the fanbase in a few ways. Communication and creating a culture has been one of those. He was hired late in the process after U.S. Soccer chose to part ways with Gregg Berhalter. There was also the factor that the Yanks qualified automatically as hosts and did not have an intense Concacaf qualification process. 

Balogun: “The intensity is created by the coach. He's created an environment so quickly that doesn't create certainty for anyone. Nobody's place is guaranteed. The internal pressure's coming from him. He's ruthless.”

Aaronson: “There's more of a seriousness because it's right around the corner. We don't have many camps left. We have to treat every friendly like it's a real game. That's the mentality. We've done a good job training the mentality of these friendlies. It's good to be a little bit more chill.

“We've always had a good relationship. From the first camp that we had together, we talked. It's been a great time learning under him. I'm looking forward to keep it growing.”

Brendan Aaronson on his brother Paxten:It's a bonus being able to see him here, and he got to show me around. Got to go see his apartment. I can tell that Denver is an amazing city.I'm really happy for him. I think it's a huge step in his life. He's doing amazing so far.

Roldan: “In all seriousness, we're here to play against two tough sides. We got a day off yesterday. Guys were able to do as they please but with structure, being home at a good time,” he said avoiding saying whether the guys went golfing or not. 

To close things out, Pochettino said that Christian Pulisic has reacted well with the ankle injury. They will evaluate him tomorrow to see if what his availability is. Antonee Robinson has been in training but will be unavailable for the game with a knee injury.

COMMERCE CITY, Colorado — U.S. star Christian Pulisic trained Monday with the national team and is available for selection for Tuesday's friendly against Australia.

Coach Mauricio Pochettino told the English-language TNT broadcast last week that Pulisic had some swelling in his ankle after training. Pulisic did not start in the 1-1 draw with Ecuador on Friday night in Austin, but subbed into the game in the 73rd minute for Tim Weah. The AC Milan attacker, who has six goals and two assists across all competitions for Milan this season, did not look limited in his outing against Ecuador.

Pulisic, who was named the Serie A Player of the Month in September, was on the training field for the public portion Monday and, barring a setback, should be available for the Americans on Tuesday.

“Christian participated in the training session, the reaction after 20 minutes of playing (on Friday) was good,” Pochettino said at Monday's pregame news conference. “He reacted very well (and the) hope (is) that tomorrow he can be available. We have to wait today (to see) the reaction, too, but much better than when he arrived.”

While Pulisic could play a role against Australia, Pochettino ruled out left back Antonee Robinson. The Fulham defender was not at training during the public portion open to reporters. Robinson did not play against Ecuador because of the knee injury that forced him to have surgery this offseason.

Robinson has played a limited role for Fulham early this season and said last week that coming into the camp, “there hasn't really been a specific conversation about how many minutes I'm going to play this trip, if any.” Right now, it looks like it will be the latter, with Robinson getting a chance to be back around the group and the coaching staff, but not yet at the level to contribute on the field.

“Antonee from (the) beginning of camp (had) some small issues in his knee, a little bit of pain,” Pochettino said. “We are managing him in the best way, but (he) still cannot be involved in training and for sure cannot be involved in the game. Hope that it's not an important thing, but he'll go back to his club in a normal way there (and hopefully will be) training and competing.”

Winger Alejandro Zendejas left camp and returned to Club America after the Ecuador game due to a knee injury.

The USMNT's Monday training session took place in blustery, 50-degree conditions just outside Denver. Staffers wore puffy coats. Multiple players, including Pulisic and Weston McKennie, wore winter hats at the start of training.

“We need to pay attention that we change from Austin to Denver. The conditions are completely different,” Pochettino said shortly after training. “You saw, we suffered.”

“And also, some players are tired,” Pochettino continued. “Some players have some — I think [we need] not to take a risk.”

Considering those factors, Pochettino said that he'd make lineup changes for the game against Australia.

“It's a good opportunity also to keep improving and showing, maybe, different approaches to the game,” he said. “For sure, there are going to be changes, and maybe change the shape.”

Roy Keane admits that Manchester United should be ""pretty ashamed"" of their decision to pull out of the FA Cup in 2000 when they were defending champions - instead choosing to play in the Club World Cup.

The Red Devils had won the domestic cup as part of their famed treble in 1999, but became the first team ever not to even attempt to defend their crown the following year. They instead chose to to play in the inaugural World Team Championship, now known as the Club World Cup.

United accepted the Football Association's offer to miss the competition. Chelsea went on to win the competition, beating Aston Villa in the final at Wembley.

The decision resulted in widespread criticism from supporters and the media, who accused the Manchester outfit of devaluing the oldest football competition in the world. Former chairman Martin Edwards said at the time that they had ""no alternative"" and made the decision ""in the national interest"".

Sir Alex Ferguson's side would only win one of their three games in the eight-team Club World Championship in Brazil - finishing third in Group B behind Mexican side Necaxa and eventual runners-up Vasco da Gama.

Keane's comments began with Gary Neville saying on The Stick to Football podcast: ""I think one thing that was definitely better back in the day was the FA Cup. That was magic when we were playing.""

The Irishman, who would win the FA Cup four times during his career, then said: ""I think the magic has come back a bit the last few years now. When you think of it when we were at United, we should be pretty ashamed because we pulled out of the FA Cup. I know it wasn't down to us but we accepted it as players. How mad was that, your team pulling out of the FA Cup.""

United claimed it was an opportunity ""to compete for the ultimate honour of being the very first world club champions"" - even if they did fail to bring the trophy home. It didn't stop their ultimate goal of retaining their Premier League title, which they did by 18 points.

Ferguson claimed at the time: ""We can't go for them all. We can't play in the FA Cup and in Brazil. That would be impossible. We're in a no-win situation here. The criticism we would have received if we hadn't gone [to Brazil] would have been unthinkable – and that's a Scotsman speaking.""

The 2026 World Cup, which is taking place in the United States, Canada and Mexico, begins on June 11 next year. It will be the 23rd edition of the tournament and the first with 48 countries competing.

Qualification around the globe is nearing completion as teams battle to reach the world's biggest sporting event.

Which countries have already secured their spot in North America next summer? How many places are awarded to each continental confederation? How far into the qualification process are those six regions?

Here is The Athletic's guide to the state of play, which will be updated as qualification progresses.

Here are the six confederations — which represent every FIFA-recognised country in the world — and how many places each has been allocated at the tournament:

AFC (Asia): Eight direct places and one team will compete in the inter-confederation play-offs.

CAF (Africa): Nine direct places and one team will compete in the inter-confederation play-offs.

CONCACAF (North America, Central America & Caribbean): Three direct places and two teams will compete in the inter-confederation play-offs. This excludes hosts United States, Canada and Mexico, who all automatically qualified as co-hosts.

CONMEBOL (South America): Six direct places and one team will compete in the inter-confederation play-offs.

OFC (Oceania): One direct place and one team will compete in the inter-confederation play-offs.

UEFA (Europe): Sixteen direct places.

The inter-confederation play-offs, which are set to take place in March 2026, will involve six teams, and two of them will advance to the World Cup. Oceania's New Caledonia and South America's Bolivia are the only sides guaranteed to be competing in the play-offs right now.

Previous World Cup appearances: 11
Best performance: Third place in 1930
Head coach: Mauricio Pochettino

The United States are hosting the World Cup for the second time — the first was in 1994 — and under former Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino will be desperate to perform well. They qualified automatically as co-hosts.

USMNT haven't got past the round of 16 since 2002 and only once have they reached the semi-finals — in the inaugural competition in 1930 when they were knocked out by Argentina.

Previous World Cup appearances: Two
Best performance: Group stage in 1986 & 2022
Head coach: Jesse Marsch

The Canadians are playing at back-to-back World Cups for the first time and under former Leeds United manager Jesse Marsch will be aiming for a maiden appearance in the knockout stage. They qualified automatically as co-hosts.

Previous World Cup appearances: 17

Mexico are hosting the men's World Cup for a record third time, after previously doing so in 1970 and 1986. Like USMNT and Canada, they qualified automatically.

The Mexicans haven't made the quarter-finals of the tournament since 1986 and were knocked out in the round of 16 at seven World Cups in a row from 1994 to 2018.

However, they are the reigning CONCACAF Gold Cup and CONCACAF Nations League champions and, on paper, they are the strongest of the three host nations.

Japan became the first country, other than the three host nations, to qualify for the World Cup with their 2-0 victory over Bahrain on March 20, 2025. It will be their eighth consecutive appearance at the tournament.

Ayase Ueda was Japan's top scorer in qualifying, with the 27-year-old Feyenoord striker finding the net eight times.

New Zealand are back at the World Cup for the first time since 2010, where they were eliminated in the group stage after drawing all three of their games.

This is the first World Cup where Oceania is guaranteed a spot at the tournament, and given Australia qualify in the Asian section, it was always likely that New Zealand would be in North America next summer.

The ‘All Whites' breezed through qualifying, winning all three of their group games by an aggregate scoreline of 19-1. They then beat Fiji 7-0 in the semi-finals on March 21 before defeating New Caledonia 3-0 in the final on March 24, 2025 to book their place at the World Cup.

Nottingham Forest's Chris Wood, who played at the 2010 World Cup, was New Zealand's top scorer in qualifying with nine goals.

Olympiacos' Mehdi Taremi was their top scorer with 10 goals.

The defending champions qualified with ease and will be among the favourites next summer. They secured their place at the tournament on March 25, 2025.

Lionel Messi will be confident of playing at a record-breaking sixth World Cup (Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo is also on five) and perhaps of also becoming the tournament's all-time top scorer — he currently trails Germany's Miroslav Klose by three goals.

As well as their triumph in Qatar in 2022, Argentina also won Copa America in 2021 and 2024 — meaning the last major tournament they played in and didn't win was the 2019 edition of South America's continental championship.

Only Brazil (22) and Germany/West Germany (20) have played at more World Cups than Argentina.

Uzbekistan became the first team who had never played at the World Cup before to qualify for the 2026 edition with their draw against United Arab Emirates on June 5, 2025.

As well as being the first double-landlocked country to ever reach the World Cup, they are also just the second former Soviet Republic (excluding Russia) to do so; after Ukraine in 2006.



Manchester City centre-back Abdukodir Khusanov is their star player and though he has played in defence so far in qualifying it would not be a surprise to see him operating higher up the pitch at the tournament next summer.

Uzbekistan qualified with a game to spare.

South Korea have now reached every World Cup from 1986 onwards, with their surprise run to the semi-finals as co-hosts in 2002 the only time they have gone beyond the round of 16 in this time.

Son Heung-min is closing in on both the outright all-time caps and goals records for South Korea and even though he will be almost 34 when the tournament starts, a lot of the Asian nation's hopes will rest on his shoulders. He scored 10 goals in qualifying.

South Korea were knocked out in the round of 16 by Brazil at the 2022 World Cup and will be hoping to improve on this in the United States, Canada and Mexico after qualifying on June 5, 2025 with a game to spare.

Australia, who qualify in the Asian section, have now reached every World Cup from 2006 onwards.

An impressive 1-0 victory over Japan in Perth on June 5, 2025 put them on the brink and their 2-1 win over Saudi Arabia on June 10 secured their spot at the tournament next summer.

Kusini Yengi, who has just spent two seasons at English club Portsmouth, was Australia's top scorer in qualifying with six goals.

Next summer, Brazil will maintain their record of playing at every World Cup — the only country to do so.

After a mixed qualification campaign, the five-time champions secured their place at the tournament with a 1-0 win over Paraguay on June 10, 2025.

It was Carlo Ancelotti's second match as Brazil's head coach and the Italian will be desperate to add the World Cup to his glittering C.V.

Ecuador qualified for the World Cup after a 0-0 draw with Peru on June 10, 2025.

Ecuador's qualification is all the more impressive given they were deducted three points before any of the games got underway due to fielding an ineligible player in the 2022 qualifiers.

Paraguay have qualified for the World Cup for the first time since 2010 after a hard-fought qualifying campaign in South America.

Mohamed Salah's Egypt are back at the World Cup after missing out in 2022. They were eliminated in the group stage in 1990 and 2018 and the round of 16 in 1934. The latter of those tournaments was a straight knockout competition and the round of 16 was the first round, hence the country's best performance being listed above as a tie between all three of the editions they have played at.

Cape Verde have qualified for the men's World Cup for the first time following Monday's 3-0 win against Eswatini.

Second-half goals from Dailon Livramento, Willy Semedo and Stopira earned the hosts a comfortable victory at the National Stadium in Praia.

The Island country, home to around 525,000 people, is the second smallest nation ever to qualify for a World Cup finals after Iceland, who participated in the 2018 edition.

Monday's result ensured Cape Verde finished top of Group D of African qualification, four points ahead of second-place Cameroon, who drew 0-0 at home to Angola on Monday.

Cape Verde missed the chance to qualify last week following an entertaining 3-3 draw with Libya in their penultimate group match.

Their only loss in the group was a 4-1 defeat in Cameroon on matchday three, but Cameroon's surprise draws in Libya, Eswatini and Angola, coupled with a 1-0 defeat in Cape Verde last month gave the islanders the advantage.

Cameroon are now aiming to be one of the top four of nine group runners-up to secure a play-off spot for the World Cup.

Villarreal defender Logan Costa is the only Cape Verdean currently playing in Europe's top five leagues, with the national squad comprised of players based in Portugal, Turkey, Cyprus, Israel, Hungary, Bulgaria, Russia, Finland, the Republic of Ireland, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

Cape Verde captain Ryan Mendes, who plays for Turkish club Kocaelispor, is the nation's record scorer (21 goals in 85 appearances) while Bebe, formerly of Manchester United, currently play for Spanish third division club Ibiza.

Alongside co-hosts United States, Canada and Mexico, 15 other nations had qualified for next year's finals ahead of this October international break. Cape Verde are the third first-time qualifiers, following Uzbekistan and Jordan.

Cape Verde have qualified for four of the most recent seven African Cup of Nations tournaments. They reached the quarter-final stage of the 2013 and 2023 editions, although missed out on qualification for the upcoming tournament in Morocco.

The 2026 World Cup will be contested between 48 nations for the first time, an expansion from the 32-team format that ran between 1998 and 2022.

By Nick Miller in Praia

The first half was riddled with tension, as Cape Verde created a series of chances but showed the classic signs of a team that had reached the edge of something exhilarating but found taking that final step tricky.

All of that disappeared in a few minutes at the start of the second half. Livramento and Semedo's goals washed all the nerves away. Stopira, the grand old man of Cape Verdean football at 37, scoring the third, just capped off an astonishing day perfectly.

It's hard to overstate how incredible this is for Cape Verde, a collection of ten small islands off the west of mainland Africa. The closest they have come to reaching the World Cup before was losing the intercontinental playoffs to Uruguay in 2014, but even then they barely stood a chance. Now, they have qualified when some of the giants of their continent – Cameroon, Nigeria – might not be there next summer.

It's an astonishing achievement, and not one that has come about by accident: they have recruited shrewdly from the Cape Verdean diaspora, and under experienced head coach Bubista have developed into a team that could genuinely cause some established powers some problems in the USA, Mexico and Canada next summer.

San Marino, the lowest-ranked soccer nation, can still qualify for the World Cup Jonathan Moscrop/Getty Images

San Marino may be at the bottom of the 210 soccer-playing nations in FIFA's men's world rankings, but the microstate still has a possibility of qualifying for next year's World Cup.

The mountainous region in north-central Italy, home to fewer than 34,000 inhabitants, has unsurprisingly lost all seven of its World Cup qualification matches to date, scoring just one goal and conceding 32.

Advertisement

San Marino has only won three of its 219 matches and none of its 169 qualification games for either a World Cup or European Championship. All three of those victories have come against Liechtenstein, another European microstate with a population of 40,000, including two in its recent Nations League campaign.

The Nations League was devised by UEFA, European football's governing body, in 2018 to minimise friendlies — non-competitive matches — and give countries meaningful encounters with similarly-ranked teams. The outcomes of the Nations League also feed into the qualification process for major tournaments, with the four highest-ranked group winners who did not qualify automatically entering a seeded play-off system.

San Marino's two victories over Liechtenstein last year, coupled with a draw against Gibraltar, saw it top its Nations League D group.



Twelve European spots are decided by the winners of the 12 qualifying groups, while four nations will qualify through UEFA's 16-team play-offs, to be played in March 2026. These play-offs will involve 16 teams, who will be split into four paths of four, with each path containing two semi-finals and a final to determine the four extra nations which qualify for the World Cup.

Those 16 teams will comprise 12 group-stage runners-up plus the four best-ranked group winners from the Nations League who did not finish in the top two of their groups in World Cup qualifying.

These were the 14 Nations League group winners for 2024-25, based on ranking priority: Spain, Germany, Portugal, France, England, Norway, Wales, Czechia, Romania, Sweden, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Moldova and San Marino.

As things stand, only Wales, Romania, Sweden, Moldova and San Marino of those nations are not in the top two of their respective World Cup qualification groups, meaning that San Marino — as the lowest-ranked of those five sides — would be the one nation to miss out on a play-off spot.

Advertisement

However, there is an important caveat: Romania are in San Marino's qualification group, and are currently third, behind second-placed Bosnia & Herzegovina and first-placed Austria. Romania play away to Bosnia on November 15, before hosting San Marino on the final matchday, and whether Romania beats Bosnia to a top-two finish — with Austria looking likely to keep first place — is likely to be decided by goal difference.

In this scenario, San Marino's best interests would be served not only by losing to Romania but by losing by as many goals as possible to ensure Romania secure a top-two finish at the expense of Bosnia and therefore create a play-off opening for itself. After hosting Romania, Bosnia faces first-placed Austria in its final qualification match on November 18, when San Marino plays Romania. Austria, meanwhile, face fourth-placed Cyprus on November 15 before its game against Bosnia.

If Bosnia gets favourable results against Romania and/or Austria, San Marino's slim chances of World Cup qualification will dwindle.

San Marino will also hope that Czechia, Sweden and Northern Ireland maintain a top-two group finish to boost its own hopes. North Macedonia and Wales are in the same group, so one will miss out on a play-off spot, while Moldova has lost all five group matches and therefore cannot mathematically qualify through its group.

San Marino can therefore only make a play-off spot if one or fewer of Romania, Czechia, Sweden and Northern Ireland miss out on a top-two finish in their groups.

The four teams who qualify for the World Cup qualification play-offs through the Nations League route will be in pot four, meaning they will play away against a pot one side — the four World Cup qualifying group runners-up with the best FIFA world ranking — in their play-off semi-final.

The other semi-final will see a pot two side, ranked fifth to eighth in the world ranking list, hosting a team from pot three, ranked ninth to 12th.

FIFA, world football's governing body, prohibits teams from deliberately losing, which it considers to be a form of match manipulation which is punishable by sanctions including disqualification and suspensions.

Match manipulation is described by FIFA as “the unlawful influencing or alteration, directly or by an act or omission, of the course, result or any other aspect of a football match or competition.”

This can include “the deliberate loss of a match or a phase of a match” and “deliberately performing badly during a match”.

So far, San Marino has recorded losses of 0-2 (Cyprus), 1-5 (Romania), 0-1 (Bosnia), 0-4 (Cyprus), 0-6 (Austria), 0-10 (Austria), 0-4 (Cyprus) in their qualification campaign.

While Eritrea, which has not played a match since 2020, are unranked by FIFA, San Marino has been rooted to the bottom of the world standings since November 2023.

San Marino's 6,600-capacity home stadium is often barely half full for matches, with travelling supporters occasionally outnumbering the hosts.

San Marino has been on the wrong end of some heavy defeats since their first official match in 1990 — including a 13-0 loss to Germany in 2006 — and has never won a match in a qualifying phase for a major tournament.

It has, however, caused some concerns to major nations, famously recording what was then the fastest goal in a World Cup qualifier when Davide Gualtieri scored after eight seconds against England in 1993 before going on to lose 7-1.

It was around the same time that San Marino achieved its highest-ever FIFA ranking of 118, but their football story had been one of relentless struggle since then.

San Marino's 2004 friendly win over Liechtenstein was the high point before their victories over the same nation in last year's Nations League.

After losing the first match of the FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Slovakia, Julian Nagelsmann's side won the last two games against Northern Ireland and Luxembourg and are now on track once again to qualify directly to the tournament next summer. On Monday, Germany will meet Northern Ireland away in what can become a key match for their chances to qualify next month to the tournament that will take place next summer in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Germany are level on six points with Northern Ireland and Slovakia after three games, with three matches remaining. Here's what you need to know about Monday's match.

Northern Ireland XI: Bailey Peacock-Farrell; Trai Hume, Patrick McNair, Eoin Toal; Brodie Spencer, Ethan Galbraith, Shea Charles, Alistair McCann, Justin Devenny; Jamie Reid, Isaac Price.

Germany XI: Oliver Baumann; Joshua Kimmich, Waldemar Anton, Jonathan Tah, David Raum; Leon Goretzka, Aleksandar Pavlovic; Serge Gnabry, Florian Wirtz, Karim Adeyemi; Nick Woltemade.

This is going to be a key match for Germany as they can potentially clinch a World Cup spot next month if they win against Northern Ireland on Monday. Pick: Germany 3, Northern Ireland 1.

 Leo Borg joined his father and ATP No.1 Club member Bjorn Borg as a match winner at the BNP Paribas Nordic Open in style on Monday night in Stockholm. 

 Competing as a wild card at the ATP 250, the 22-year-old Borg eased past Sebastian Ofner 6-3, 6-4 to register his second ATP Tour victory (his other came in Bastad in 2023). The No. 633 in the PIF ATP Rankings converted two of three break points he earned, according to Infosys ATP Stats, en route to sealing a second-round spot at an event where his father defeated great rival John McEnroe to lift the title in 1980. 

 “This is really special. My first Stockholm win is so special,” said Borg, who will face third seed and 2019 champion Denis Shapovalov in the second round. “I really stepped up my game, so I'm really happy with my performance. I have the level, but the consistency has not been my greatest side. I've really worked on my stuff, and I really stepped up today and showed myself, and the tennis people, that I really belong here. 

 “I've been injured for some time and how I managed today to come back and show myself that I really belong here. It's a good, positive thing. I just have to keep doing my thing.” 

 Borg's 76-minute victory was his first against a Top 150 opponent in nine attempts. The Swede has mostly competed on the ITF World Tennis Tour this year as he looks to rebuild toward career-high of World No. 334 and beyond. 

 ""I played really good today and it helped so much with this crowd, it was amazing,"" said Borg in his on-court interview. ""I knew he had a big game, so I really had to play much better. But I really stepped up today and am really happy with my performance. Yeah, really good."" 



 Jacob Fearnley's first test at the BNP Paribas Nordic Open was to try and complete a Stockholm revenge job on Tallon Griekspoor. The Briton succeeded in his mission Monday, although not before some deciding-tie-break drama. 

 The No. 79 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Fearnley upset fifth seed Griekspoor 6-3, 6-7(6), 7-6(5) on Day 1 of the indoor ATP 250 to avenge his second-round loss to the Dutchman at the same event a year ago. Fearnley at one point led 6/2 in the third-set tie-break but lost four points in a row, including two on his own serve, before wrapping his two-hour, 44-minute win. 

 “That was very tough. I thought things were going fairly comfortably up until 5/3 when I was serving for it, and I got a little bit tight,” said Fearnley in his on-court interview. “To be fair to Tallon, he competed hard and upped his level when he needed to. It was just a war until the end. Huge respect to Tallon, but happy to be through.”

 Fearnley completed victory despite being outhit 32-34 by Griekspoor in the winner count. The 24-year-old Briton's serve was the foundation for his triumph, and he finished the match having won 78 per cent (45/58) of points behind his first delivery, according to Infosys ATP Stats. 

 After levelling his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Griekspoor at 1-1, Fearnley will next prepare for a second-round meeting against one of two brothers: Home wild cards Mikael Ymer and Elias Ymer play their first-round match on Tuesday for the right to take on the Scot.

What separates Coco Gauff right now isn't power or pace. It's the calm she brings to the biggest moments, something she showed again in her run to the Wuhan title.

At the pivotal juncture of 4-all in Sunday's opening set, Coco Gauff hit three of her four aces in a single game. Down 5-3 in the second set, Gauff ran off 10 straight points on the way to a 6-4, 7-5 victory over Jessica Pegula.

Gauff, your Dongfeng Voyah · Wuhan Open champion, is the consummate closer. She has played in nine Hologic WTA Tour hard-court finals -- and won them all. No one else in the history of women's tennis has triumphed in her first nine hard-court finals.

“Oh, wow,” Gauff said on hearing that statistic, then burst into laughter during a conversation with wtatennis.com. “Your answer is probably just as good as mine. I don't know, honestly. I think in finals, there's something in you that wants to just go, because I made it this far, and I want to hold the trophy.

“On hard courts, that's where I feel the most comfortable, on the courts I grew up playing on. I think I've gotten lucky in some matches, others I just felt good that day.”

Mixing speeds and spins with a variety of slices like a crafty veteran pitcher, the 21-year-old American kept the ball in play and consistently prevailed in the longer rallies. The weary Pegula, who thrives on an opponent's pace, had little to work with.

This was the 31-year-old's 10th match in 14 days. Coming into the final, Pegula had played eight consecutive three-set matches. Including Beijing, her two-week total was a staggering 28 sets. Friendly suggestion: Don't try this at home.

Gauff, who lost in WTA 1000 finals earlier this year on the clay in Madrid and Rome, collected her third career 1000 title. She's the third-youngest to do that in the 16-year history of the format, after Iga Swiatek and Caroline Wozniacki.

For the record, Gauff is a resplendent 22-3 in China.

“I think it's a combination of the timing of the season, knowing that you're so close to the season being over that you're just like, ‘Whatever happens, happens,'” she said. “And also the conditions here I feel like favor my game. The courts in Beijing were a little bit quicker and then here a little bit slower. In Wuhan the conditions were similar to what I train in in Florida so I felt really comfortable on the court.”

The win underlined what has become an interesting -- and hugely successful -- pattern. For the third straight year, Gauff is benefiting from a coaching change late in the season.

“I feel like I'm constantly trying to evolve and get better,” Gauff said. “It's not anything against the coaches I worked with -- I can still be at the top and want to get better. Sometimes, a new perspective helps. It's not always about what they say -- maybe they're saying similar things -- but maybe the approach is a little bit different and I'm able to receive it better. 

“I'm definitely happy with my team. I don't want to make changes anymore. I'm really proud of how I've managed to turn this part of the season around.”

Further highlights from her interview:

You looked like a crafty baseball pitcher out there, changing speeds and spins … what prompted you to go with that strategy against Jess?

Playing Jess, she's a really great ball-striker. Honestly, it wasn't always a part of the plan, but I was just thinking it was the shot I had to do in the moment. She hits the ball so low and flat sometimes I feel the only option is the slice at times. Today was also cooler than the earlier rounds, and the court was playing slow, so I felt like hitting winners and powering through would be pretty hard because the court was just so slow.

Neither of you showed much emotion during the match. At times it was like watching Venus and Serena Williams play each other … How difficult is it to play such a good friend?

It's definitely difficult playing a friend in the final. It's ups and downs, for sure. I don't do it intentionally, but maybe I am a little more chill in the reactions and stuff. Jess is always calm, she doesn't let out too much. When you play someone that you know, for me, it makes it more fun. Obviously, you want to win for yourself, but if you lose you know you're losing to someone that you respect, on and off the court. 

Working with Gavin MacMillan, where would you say your serve is right now?

Obviously, it was a big hole in my game, the serve, and it still can get better. But I definitely think it's been a big improvement since Cincinnati and New York to now. It's just about trusting the process. Before, I was serving technically wrong and I felt like I didn't have a solution with it. Now I have a solution, and it's continuing to trust that when the moments get tight. In a general sense, I changed the way I toss the ball and my motion on the serve. I don't want to get too specific, but if you look at the before and after, I'm turning a little bit more on my toss. 

What will the next few weeks look like for you?

Just going home [to South Florida] and training, getting ready for Riyadh. It's the last tournament of the year, and I'm looking forward to it. And then the season's over.

You're the defending champion in Riyadh. What are your goals and expectations for the WTA Finals?

I think just taking it match by match. I don't know when the last time someone's defended the title [Serena Williams in 2013 and 2014] -- it's a pretty tough title to defend, given that you're playing the top eight players in the world. I'm just going to go in with no expectations. I just want to make it out of my group. That's what my goal was last year.

Some players break into the Top 10 as teenagers, but some take a little more time—like Ekaterina Alexandrova, who makes her Top 10 debut today at 30 years young, moving up one spot from No. 11 to No. 10.She's been close for a few years now, reaching the Top 20 for the first time in 2022, then going as high as No. 16 in 2023 and No. 15 in 2024.But 2025 has been the best season of her career, highlighted by capturing the biggest title of her career at the WTA 500 indoor hard-court event in Linz, which is held right after the Australian Open.She reached two more finals this year, both at WTA 500s in Monterrey and Seoul, another four semifinals (including at a WTA 1000 in Doha) and two more quarterfinals. She also reached the fourth round at the last three Grand Slams—Roland Garros, Wimbledon and the US Open.The result that put her over the line, though, was reaching the round of 16 in Wuhan last week, coincidentally her 16th round of 16 of the year.And it's about time, too, as Alexandrova has clearly shown she can hang with the Top 10—she has 19 career wins against the elite, the majority of them coming over the last few years, including five this year against Aryna Sabalenka and Jessica Pegula (in Doha), Zheng Qinwen (in Charleston) and Mirra Andreeva and Pegula again (in Stuttgart).The big-hitting veteran continues her season in Ningbo this week.

Our Tennis Channel analysts set the table for an intriguing finish to an exciting season.ByTENNIS.comPublished Oct 13, 2025 copy_link

With the final month of the 2025 season fast approaching, the Tennis Channel team takes a look at the growing ATP and WTA Finals fields and make their expert picks on who has the most to prove, which players on the bubble are most likely to qualify, and which of the men's and women's year-end championships will be more exciting.First up: Which ATP Player has the most to prove heading into Turin? (Spoiler Alert: it's unanimous.)

First up: Which ATP Player has the most to prove heading into Turin? (Spoiler Alert: it's unanimous.)

Of the top players, Alexander Zverev has certainly been the most volatile. He's been at the top for such a long time and we know his struggles to win that elusive major title. But he has also had such great success in past ATP Finals—winning the title twice—that this could not only be a great way to finish 2025 but also help him jumpstart a new chapter starting in 2026.JON WERTHEIMRight now, Alexander Zverev's No. 3 ranking looks decorative. It's time to make a real statement that proves he is the third-party candidate, the player most likely to challenge the Jannik Sinner-Carlos Alcaraz axis.CHANDA RUBINI'm not sure I'd catergorize it as something to prove, but I think Alexander Zverev is the player who might have a few more questions to answer. He's still at the top of the game and a threat against anyone but he has lost some ground with Sinner and Alcaraz so dominant at the majors. Coming to the end of the season, this could be an opportunity for Zverev to reassert his game.

Alexander Zverev's first round loss at Wimbledon kicked off an uneven second half of his season. He's just 5-5 since Cincinnati. He's won the ATP Finals twice before, but his confidence has seemingly taken a hit this year—all this despite still ranking third overall.STEVE WEISSMANOther than Novak Djokovic, Alexander Zverev is the only active player with multiple ATP Finals titles. After claiming that tournament directors are slowing down courts to help Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, he needs to prove he can beat them. That might prove an extremely tall order: Zverev has lost his last 10 matches combined to Alcaraz, Sinner, Djokovic and Taylor Fritz All of those players are ones he'll likely face in Turin.

For years, the Principality of Monaco has been better known for its luxurious lifestyle, iconic Formula 1 race, and stunning Mediterranean views than for producing top-level tennis players. But that may soon change, as Valentin Vacherot, a 26-year-old right-hander with a powerful serve and unwavering competitiveness, is steadily rewriting Monaco's tennis history.A tennis-centered upbringingBorn on Nov. 16, 1998 in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, France, Vacherot grew up in a tennis family. His cousin is French ATP player Arthur Rinderknech, and his half-brother and current coach is former Monegasque pro Benjamin Balleret.That close connection to the sport shaped his early path. Though he didn't have a lengthy junior career—his best ITF junior ranking was No. 440—he made his professional debut at just 15 years old in 2014, and earned his first ranking point the following year.College tennis rootsInstead of turning pro full-time right away, Vacherot took a different route: U.S. college tennis. From 2016 to 2020, he represented Texas A&M University in College Station, where he also earned a business degree.During that time, he played alongside his cousin Rinderknech, refining his all-court game and gaining valuable competitive experience in one of the strongest collegiate programs in the United States.

Vacherot returned to the professional circuit in 2021 with renewed focus. That season, he reached five finals on the ITF World Tennis Tour and captured his first two titles in Monastir, Tunisia and New Delhi, India, ending the year ranked world No. 631. He also represented Monaco for the first time in the Davis Cup. He holds a 14-3 match record in the competition in 11 ties played.In 2022, he broke into the Top 500 for the first time, and two years later, he soared into the Top 200. In June 2024, after a remarkable 15-0 run on the ATP Challenger Tour, he achieved a career-high ranking of No. 110.A four-time ATP Challenger champion, most recently in Pune, India last year, Vacherot has demonstrated that his game translates well across surfaces and levels. At 6-foot-4, he combines explosive serving with a solid baseline game and growing confidence under pressure.

Vacherot has won four ATP Challenger titles in his career, three of which came last year.

But the breakthrough that truly put him on the tennis map came last week at the Rolex Shanghai Masters. He arrived in China as the ninth alternate, eventually made the cut, entered the qualifying, and ended up being the champion of an ATP Masters 1000 event.🖥️📲 The Match in 15 Minutes: Vacherot vs. Rinderknech, ShanghaiVacherot was the last man standing in Shanghai, capping off a dream fortnight by becoming the eighth first-time ATP Tour champion of the 2025 season, and only the fifth player in history to win his maiden title at a Masters tournament.In a gripping final, the Monegasque defeated his cousin Rinderknech 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 after two hours and 14 minutes of high-intensity tennis.

“It is unreal what just happened. I have no idea what is happening right now. I am not even dreaming, it is just crazy,” Vacherot said after Sunday's final. “I am just so happy with my performances the past two weeks.""I just want to thank everyone who has helped with my career since the beginning. There has to be one loser, but I think there is two winners today, one family that won. And I think for the sport of tennis, the story is unreal.""

""I just want to thank everyone who has helped with my career since the beginning. There has to be one loser, but I think there is two winners today, one family that won. And I think for the sport of tennis, the story is unreal.""

It was the perfect ending to an extraordinary run. Vacherot became the lowest-ranked champion in ATP Masters 1000 history, surviving six three-set battles across nine matches from qualifying to the final. Time and again, he clawed his way back from behind, showcasing remarkable grit and composure.What began as an unlikely run turned into a career-defining triumph—and with it, a massive leap in ranking, confidence and belief. The fairytale in Shanghai has made Vacherot not just richer in terms of prize money, but far more seasoned and ready for the next chapter of his journey.

Luke Browning will make his latest practice appearance with Williams during F1's final flyaway stint in 2025.

F2 title contender and Williams Racing Academy Driver Luke Browning will take part in the first practice session for the upcoming Mexico City Grand Prix, the Grove-based outfit have confirmed.

Browning will take over the wheel of Carlos Sainz's FW47 for the opening 60-minute session at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, fulfilling the third of four mandated rookie driver runs for Williams this year.

It is set to mark his second outing in Williams' 2025 challenger following an FP1 appearance in Bahrain earlier this year, which came after Browning's F1 practice debut at the 2024 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

He has also driven the FW45 extensively in the squad's TPC (Testing of Previous Cars) programme, while providing additional support through simulator development work.

Browning is currently involved in a close fight for the F2 title, holding third in the standings on 161 points with two rounds to go – behind Aston Martin development driver Jak Crawford on 169 points and leader Leonardo Fornaroli on 188 points.

“I'm hugely grateful to be given another chance to drive in a free practice session with Williams and to experience the FW47 for a second time,” said Browning.

“I've been working hard to prepare for the session so I can make the most of this amazing opportunity and help the team plan for the race weekend ahead.

“I can't wait to get back into an F1 car and I'm incredibly grateful to everyone in the Driver Academy and at Williams for their trust and support.”

Sven Smeets, Williams' Sporting Director, added: “Luke has had a strong season in Formula 2 so far, consistently showing his pace across a range of circuits and racing conditions.

“He has continued to support the team through his simulator work and the TPC programme, preparing him well for his next free practice session.

“We look forward to seeing him take to the track in Mexico as he continues to build his experience as a Williams Racing Academy Driver.”

Paramount's initial bid for the home of HBO and Warner Bros. was dismissed, but one way or another the company will grapple with major change in the coming year.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	Ever since the media mogul John Malone helped persuade David Zaslav to leave NBC and become the CEO of Discovery Communications, the executive has defined his leadership by dealmaking. He acquired Scripps Networks to try and build a reality-driven entertainment giant, and forged the deal for WarnerMedia over golf emojis with AT&T CEO John Stankey.


	But the next few months will be a critical time, as Zaslav grapples with what will be his most consequential deal yet: Does he sell? Or does he split?




Paramount CEO David Ellison has made no secret about his desire for Warner Bros. Discovery in private conversations with Hollywood power players, but his initial approach of $20 per share was dismissed by WBD, Bloomberg reported over the weekend.

	Of course Ellison, perhaps armed with a higher offer (possibly one backed by his father Larry Ellison or a third party like Apollo), will likely return, and per The Wall Street Journal he may attempt to go directly to WBD shareholders if the company doesn't engage. That said, the argument they are making about regulatory concerns (namely that Paramount is in better shape to evade tough scrutiny from the Trump administration) can only carry so much weight relative to the dollar signs.




			Related Video		







	Still, Ellison has openly spoken about making big deals.


	“I think, ironically, it was [WBD CEO] David Zaslav who said last year that consolidation in the media business is important. The way we approach everything is, first and foremost, what's good for the talent community, what's good for our shareholders and value creation, and what's good for, basically, storytelling at large,” Ellison said at the Bloomberg Screentime conference last week. “From our standpoint, whether we approach any acquisition — and I actually do think there are a lot of options out there in terms of what might be actionable in the near future — we would approach it through the lens of wanting to make more, not less. … You need more content to yield more engagement.”

	











	Ellison wants to scoop up Warner Bros. Discovery before Zaslav can execute his other big gambit: a split of the company in two, with HBO and the Warner Bros. studios in one business that he will lead, and Gunnar Weidenfels leading the former Discovery and Warner networks in another (along with added debt and a stake in the studios business).


	The split, currently expected by April, is meant to unlock value, Zaslav and other WBD execs have argued, noting that a studios and HBO business unburdened by debt or linear TV channels would be much more appealing to potential acquirers, while the Discovery business (including CNN) would have multiple strategic options it could pursue.


	Discovery could be run for cash, serve as a rollup vehicle, sell off assets piecemeal, reinvest in its brands or sell the whole thing off to private equity, notes Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif-Ehrlich, who was among the Wall Street insiders calling for such a strategic move last year. It's a veritable Cheesecake Factory menu of options.


	The influential Wall Street analyst, meanwhile, also frames the post-split Warner Bros. business as a “crown jewel” asset, one that would shake buyers off the sidelines.


	“It is our view that as a standalone entity WBD's streaming and studio assets would generate a bidding war amongst potential buyers, and therefore, we believe a split of the company can garner the greatest potential value,” Reif-Ehrlich wrote in a Sept. 30 note, after Ellison's interest had been reported.

	











	It's a point of view that seems to be shared by WBD executives, perhaps confident that post-split Ellison and Paramount would still covet Warners, but so would Apple, Netflix, Comcast, Sony or other bidders.


	But is the interest real? Or is it a mirage — as Ellison and his team are sure to argue. Greg Peters, the co-CEO of Netflix, when asked about a potential deal for Warner Bros., mostly dismissed the idea.


	“We come from a deep heritage of being builders rather than buyers. I also think that one should have a reasonable amount of skepticism around big media mergers, they don't have an amazing track record over the history of time,” Peters said, before leaving a door open, noting that “I would say it's our responsibility to evaluate all our options.”


	Another notable Wall Street analyst, LightShed's Rich Greenfield, is similarly skeptical of a Netflix deal for WB.


	“While we are sure there's IP inside Warner Bros. that Netflix would love to remake or exploit, and while Hollywood catalog IP performs well on Netflix (Despicable Me 3 and The Mask are both in Netflix's Top 10 movies today in the US), the content driving Netflix's subscriber growth has been original IP,” Greenfield wrote Oct. 6. “Not to mention, Netflix is having no trouble licensing catalog content from Hollywood studios who are increasingly desperate to license to Netflix.”


	Whatever happens in the near term, it's clear that Warner Bros. is at a pivot point: Maybe Ellison circles back and delivers a deal that can bring the storied studio under Skydance control, or maybe Zaslav goes through with his split and sees what the market will bear.

	











	One of the most storied studios in Hollywood could be acquired by another, by a tech giant, or left to fend for itself. Ellison is waiting in the wings. Is anyone else?

Broadway musicians have voted to authorize a strike amid negotiations with the Broadway League over a new contract. 


	Ninety-eight percent of union members voted to authorize a strike, according to results tallied Sunday. Holding a strike authorization vote does not necessarily mean a strike would be called, and it is a show of strength amid contract discussions, but it also comes as Actors' Equity has already voted to authorize a strike amid negotiations with the League. 




	The musicians' union continues to have talks with the Broadway League over a new contract this week and the possibility of bringing in a mediator is also being discussed.

	A mediator has been called in for discussions with Actors' Equity and the Broadway League, and the two parties scheduled an extra bargaining session with a mediator present for Oct. 17. The main sticking point for Actors' Equity has been around healthcare contributions. 


	Musicians have been working without a contract since Aug. 31 and have also been lobbying for “stable” healthcare coverage, as well as wage gains and job security. 


	“On the heels of the most successful season in history, the Broadway League wants the working musicians and artists who fueled that very success to accept wage cuts, threats to healthcare benefits, and potential job losses. Faced with such an egregious erosion of their working conditions, Local 802 Broadway musicians and other artists are ready to leverage every ounce of their collective power, up to and including a strike. Committing to anything less would mean sacrificing far too many hard-won gains,” Local 802 President Bob Suttmann said in a statement. 

	











	If the two unions were to strike at the same time, the only current musical that could go on would be Ragtime at the Lincoln Center, as it's not part of the contract at issue for either union. Among current shows, the nonprofit play Punch, as well as Little Bear Ridge Road, produced by Scott Rudin, who is not a member of the League, could also go on.

The country's largest exhibitor is honoring the late actress by bringing back two of her signature films to 100 cinemas across the U.S.  


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	In a fitting tribute to the late Diane Keaton, AMC Theatres is bringing back Annie Hall and Something's Gotta Give to 100 cinemas across the U.S., The Hollywood Reporter has learned.


Keaton died unexpectedly on Oct. 11 at her home in Los Angeles at age 79, less than a month after Robert Redford‘s passing. As THR wrote in a critic's appreciation, their deaths represent “another stinging loss to the pantheon of New Hollywood in the decades before the major studios largely stepped away from making movies for grownups.”




Annie Hall was the result of Keaton's long-time collaboration with the now-canceled filmmaker Woody Allen, both when they were romantically involved and after. The movies she made with him are considered some of her most acclaimed work, with Keaton winning the Oscar for best actress for her titular performance in Annie Hall.

	Released in April 1977, Annie Hall earned a respectable $38.3 million at the domestic box office, not adjusted for inflation, while there is no way to put a price tag on its cultural impact. It ranks No. 31 on the American Film Institute's list of 100 Greatest Movies in American Cinema, No. 4 on its comedy list.


	Keaton would earn three more Oscar nominations for best actress, culminating with director Nancy Meyers‘ Something's Gotta Give, an unexpected twist on the May-to-December plotline that co-stars Jack Nicholson and Keanu Reeves. The 2003 movie was also a runaway commercial success, earning $124.7 million domestically and $142 million overseas for a global haul of $266.7 million. That makes it the top-grossing live-action film of Keaton's career in a leading role, not adjusted for inflation.

	











	Other movie theater circuits are also likely to host Keaton retrospectives, while her films have quickly climbed up iTunes' movie rental chart since her passing. On Monday, Something's Gotta Give sat at No. 5, followed by Annie Hall at No. 14. Because I Said So, Reds and Baby Boom were also seeing an uptick, underscoring her rich and varied body of work.

Swift monopolizes the top 10 thanks to her new album, The Life of a Showgirl. She does so for a third time — no one else ever has at all.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



Taylor Swift claims the top 12 spots on the latest Billboard Hot 100, all via her new album, The Life of a Showgirl. On the chart dated Oct. 18, “The Fate of Ophelia” leads her dozen debuts at No. 1 — as the 12-song set becomes the first album ever to place all its songs uninterrupted from the top of the chart on down.


	Swift was already the only artist ever to hold the Hot 100's entire top 10 and now achieves the feat for a third time. She first filled the top 10 thanks to her album Midnights in November 2022 and outpaced herself via The Tortured Poets Department in May 2024 — when she stormed the chart's top 14 positions.


	(Whereas the entirety of The Life of a Showgirl resides in the Hot 100's top 12, Midnights, along with the top 10, yielded 10 more debuts, between Nos. 13 and 45, for a total of 20 songs from the set in its debut week; The Tortured Poets Department in its first frame added another 17 debuts below the top 14 spots, from Nos. 22 to 55, making for 31 total entries from the LP.)


	With “The Fate of Ophelia,” Swift scores her 13th career Hot 100 No. 1, tying for the fourth-most over the chart's 67-year history. She also ups her count to 69 top 10s, the most among women.


	Also notably, the song blasts in with 92.5 million official U.S. streams, according to data tracker Luminate — the most for a title in a single week since official streams became the metric's sole contributor to the Hot 100 in September 2020.


	As previously reported, The Life of a Showgirl, released Oct. 3 on Republic, launches at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart with the biggest week for an album, by equivalent album units and album sales, since Luminate began collecting album data electronically in 1991. Swift earns her 15th No. 1 set, passing JAY-Z for the most among soloists in the chart's 69-year archives.


	Read on for in-depth highlights of Swift's latest historic week on the Hot 100.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Oct. 18, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Oct. 14. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.


Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.


	Swift swoops in from Nos. 1 through 12 on the Hot 100, as the entirety of The Life of a Showgirl blocks all competition atop the chart.


	Here's a look at Swift's songs in the top 12 on the Oct. 18-dated Hot 100:




	“The Fate of Ophelia,” which arrives as the 1,184th No. 1 in the Hot 100's history, drew 92.5 million official streams and 38.5 million radio airplay audience impressions in the United States Oct. 3-9. It, like all tracks from The Life of a Showgirl, has no sales counting toward the list, as they were not available for purchase individually during the album's first week of release.


	The single is Swift's 10th leader on the Streaming Songs chart, the most among women (and second overall only to Drake's 21). On Radio Songs, it debuts as her 22nd top 10 at No. 7; it's just the fifth song to start in the top 10 since the ranking began measuring all-format airplay in December 1998, joining Rihanna's “Lift Me Up” (No. 6, 2022); Adele's “Easy on Me” (No. 4, 2021); Lady Gaga's “Born This Way” (No. 6, 2011); and Janet Jackson's “All for You” (No. 9, 2001).


	The start of “The Fate of Ophelia” (whose official video premiered Oct. 5) with 92.5 million streams marks the top total for a song in a single week since all YouTube user-generated content (UGC) was removed from chart calculations in 2020. The sum surpasses the 76.4 million streams that Post Malone's “I Had Some Help,” featuring Morgan Wallen, drew in its first week (May 25, 2024).


	Meanwhile, cuts from The Life of a Showgirl hold the nine biggest weekly streaming totals of 2025, excluding holiday fare, from “The Fate of Ophelia” through the title track, which drew 49.1 million streams. Prior leader “Not Like Us” by Kendrick Lamar now ranks 10th, with 49 million (Feb. 22). Combined, the 12 tracks on The Life of a Showgirl collected 679 million official streams Oct. 3-9.


	Plus, each of the 12 songs from The Life of a Showgirl totaled at least 1.1 million in airplay audience, from “The Fate of Ophelia” through “Eldest Daughter.” Cumulatively, they rang up 68.5 million in radio reach.


	Swelling her count to a signature 13 Hot 100 No. 1s, Swift ties Drake and Michael Jackson for the fourth-most leaders in the chart's history; she breaks out of a tie with Madonna and the Supremes. Among women, only Mariah Carey (19) and Rihanna (14) have more.


Most Billboard Hot 100 No. 1s:


	Here's a recap of Swift's 13 Hot 100 No. 1s (with debuts atop the chart noted with *):




	Now with eight No. 1 Hot 100 debuts, Swift passes Ariana Grande for the most among women. Overall, only Drake has more (nine).


	Plus, Swift pushes her total to eight Hot 100 No. 1s in the 2020s, one-upping Drake for the most this decade. BTS and Grande follow with six No. 1s each in the ‘20s.


	As “The Fate of Ophelia” towers over the Hot 100, Swift extends her record streak to nine consecutive albums of all-new music (excluding rerecorded projects) housing at least one Hot 100 No. 1.


	Here's a rundown:




	Adding 10 new Hot 100 top 10s, Swift boosts her career total from 59 to 69, the most among women.


Most Billboard Hot 100 Top 10s:


	Of Swift's 69 Hot 100 top 10s, 30 are from her three most recent studio albums of all-new material, with The Life of a Showgirl joining The Tortured Poets Department and Midnights in spinning off a record 10 top 10s each.


	Swift also lifts her career sums to 177 top 40 hits (trailing only Drake's 218) and 276 overall appearances (second to Drake's 361).


	Swift co-wrote and co-produced “The Fate of Ophelia” with Max Martin and Shellback. She has now co-written 13 Hot 100 No. 1s and co-produced seven.


	Martin adds his 28th Hot 100 No. 1 as a songwriter, second only to Paul McCartney's 32. Martin tallies his record-extending 26th No. 1 as a producer.


	Shellback notches his 11th Hot 100 leader as a writer and 10th as a producer.


	Amid Swift's top 10 Tay-keover, the Hot 100 histories of Sabrina Carpenter and the late George Michael add new honors.


	As featured on “The Life of a Showgirl,” Carpenter collects her sixth Hot 100 top 10. It's her third this year, following her own “Manchild” (No. 1, one week, June) and “Tears” (No. 3, September), both from her latest album, Man's Best Friend.


	Swift's “Father Figure” interpolates Michael's song of the same name, which topped the Hot 100 for two weeks in 1988, following its release on his album Faith. The new track is his 22nd top 10 as a writer, with “Father Figure” previously sampled in P.M. Dawn's top 10 hit “Looking Through Patient Eyes” (No. 6, 1993).


	Below Swift's haul on the Hot 100, HUNTR/X's “Golden,” from Netflix's record-breaking animated movie KPop Demon Hunters, is the list's highest-charting hit, falling to No. 13 after eight weeks at No. 1. “Golden” tops Digital Song Sales for a fourth week (7,000, up 19%, boosted by the trio's appearances on NBC's Saturday Night Live Oct. 4 and The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon Oct 7.)


	At No. 14 on the Hot 100, Alex Warren's former 10-week leader “Ordinary” drops from No. 2, while ruling Radio Songs for a 17th week, up 1% to 77.4 million in audience — a new weekly best for the track and the most for any song in more than a year, since Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” (78.2 million) on the Oct. 5, 2024, chart.

	Gary Trust



Taylor Swift holds nine of the top 10 spots on both the Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts, all thanks to her new album, The Life of a Showgirl.


	“The Fate of Ophelia” leads the lists, debuting as Swift's sixth and fourth No. 1, respectively, dating to the charts' starts in September 2020. On the Global 200, she passes Ariana Grande for the most leaders among women; on Global Excl. U.S., she ties Grande and BLACKPINK for the most among solo women or all-female groups.

	











	HUNTR/X's “Golden,” from Netflix's animated hit movie KPop Demon Hunters, is the only song in Swift's way in the top 10 of the charts, at No. 5 on the Global 200 and No. 2 on Global Excl. U.S., falling from No. 1 after 12 weeks atop each tally, beginning in July.


The Life of a Showgirl, released Oct. 3, charges in at No. 1 on the U.S.-based Billboard 200 chart with the biggest week for an album, by equivalent album units and album sales, since Luminate began collecting album data electronically in 1991. Swift earns her 15th No. 1 set, passing JAY-Z for the most among soloists in the chart's history.


	On the U.S.-based Billboard Hot 100, “The Fate of Ophelia” opens at No. 1 as Swift's 13th leader.


	The Billboard Global 200 and Global Excl. U.S. charts rank songs based on streaming and sales activity culled from more than 200 territories around the world, as compiled by Luminate. The Global 200 is inclusive of worldwide data and the Global Excl. U.S. chart comprises data from territories excluding the United States.

	











	Chart ranks are based on a weighted formula incorporating official-only streams on both subscription and ad-supported tiers of audio and video music services, as well as download sales, the latter of which reflect purchases from full-service digital music retailers from around the world, with sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites excluded from the charts' calculations.


	“The Fate of Ophelia” rules the Global 200 with 216.9 million streams worldwide in the week ending Oct. 9. (It, like all tracks from The Life of a Showgirl, has no sales counting toward the chart, as they were not available for purchase individually during the album's first week of release.)


	The song scores the fifth-highest streaming week worldwide since the Global 200 began:




	Here's where all the songs from the 12-track The Life of a Showgirl rank on the Global 200:


	“The Fate of Ophelia” tops Global Excl. U.S. with 125.3 million streams beyond the U.S. 


	Songs from The Life of a Showgirl shine in the spotlight on Global Excl. U.S. in this order:

	













	Swift pushes her totals to 42 top 10s on the Global 200 and 29 on Global Excl. U.S. On the former, she passes Drake (37) for the most in the chart's archives; on the latter, she bests Bad Bunny (24) for the record.


	Plus, Swift ties her own mark for the most concurrent Global 200 top 10s, after she took nine of the top 10 on May 4, 2024, and Nov. 5, 2022, when her albums The Tortured Poets Department and Midnights made their chart starts, respectively. She breaks the record on Global Excl. U.S., surpassing the eight songs that she placed in the top 10 upon the chart arrival of Midnights.


	Meanwhile, as featured on “The Life of a Showgirl,” Sabrina Carpenter adds her seventh top 10 on the Global 200 and sixth on Global Excl. U.S.


	The Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts (dated Oct. 18, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Oct. 14.

In a company-wide letter, Grainge highlighted UMG's ""progress"" in fostering ""responsible AI"" and exploring how to generate new revenue using the technology.

	Chris Eggertsen



	Universal Music Group (UMG) chairman/CEO Lucian Grainge has updated UMG employees on the “progress” the music giant is making on generative artificial intelligence in a new staff-wide memo circulated Monday (Oct. 13), which outlines the company's efforts to safeguard artists' copyrighted material while touting the technology's potential to unlock new revenue.


	“UMG is playing a pioneering role in fostering AI's enormous potential,” Grainge wrote in the memo. “While our progress is significant, the speed at which this technology is developing makes it important that you are all continually updated on our efforts and well-versed on the strategy and approach.”


	Grainge went on to highlight UMG's work with AI developers, noting the company's AI deals with top platforms like YouTube, TikTok and Meta as well as emerging ones like BandLab and Soundlabs. Universal Music Japan, he added, recently announced a deal with Japanese telecommunications company KDDI to develop new music experiences for fans and artists using the technology.


	The CEO also discussed AI's potential “to connect our artists with their fans in new ways,” including through the use of agentic AI — essentially AI agents that are capable of more sophisticated problem-solving. In Grainge's words, agentic AI has “the potential to revolutionize how fans interact with and discover music” and help provide “a significant source of new future revenue for artists and songwriters.”


	Grainge additionally reiterated UMG's commitment to responsibly trained AI, mentioning the company's deals with AI developers like ProRata and KLAY and noting that it's “in discussions with numerous additional like-minded companies whose products provide accurate attribution and tools which empower and compensate artists — products that both protect music and enhance its monetization.”


	“And to be clear — and this is very important — we will NOT license any model that uses an artist's voice or generates new songs which incorporate an artist's existing songs without their consent,” Grainge continued. He added that many AI companies' efforts to make it legal to train AI technology on copyrighted material with the consent of rights holders “amount to nothing more than the unauthorized (and, we believe, illegal) exploitation of the rights and property of creative artists.”


	Grainge also addressed the topic of so-called “AI slop” on streaming services, pointing out UMG's unveiling of “artist-centric” principles at the top of 2023 — notably before the AI revolution really began taking hold in the music business later that year — that he says were designed to “combat what is essentially platform pollution.” 


	“Since then, many of our platform partners have made significant progress in putting in place measures to address the diversion of royalties, infringement and fraud — all to the benefit of the entire music ecosystem,” he wrote, later noting UMG's recently announced collaboration with SoundPatrol, which utilizes neural fingerprinting that it says can detect the use of copyrighted material in AI-generated songs (Sony also partnered with the company).


	Read Grainge's full memo below.


Dear Colleagues,


I am writing today to update you on the progress that we are making on our efforts to take advantage of the developing commercial opportunities presented by Gen AI technology for the benefit of all our artists and songwriters.  


I want to address three specific topics:  


UMG is playing a pioneering role in fostering AI's enormous potential.  While our progress is significant, the speed at which this technology is developing makes it important that you are all continually updated on our efforts and well-versed on the strategy and approach.  


The foundation of what we're doing is the belief that together, we can foster a healthy commercial AI ecosystem in which artists, songwriters, music companies and technology companies can all flourish together.  


NEW AGREEMENTS


To explore the varied opportunities and determine the best approaches, we have been working with AI developers to put their ideas to the test.  In fact, we were the first company to enter into AI-related agreements with companies ranging from major platforms such as YouTube, TikTok and Meta to emerging entrepreneurs such as BandLab, Soundlabs, and more.  Both creatively and commercially our portfolio of AI partnerships continues to expand.


Very recently, Universal Music Japan announced an agreement with KDDI, a leading Japanese telecommunications company, to develop new music experiences for fans and artists using Gen AI.  And we are very actively engaged with nearly a dozen different companies on significant new products and service plans that hold promise for a dramatic expansion of the AI music landscape.  Further, we're seeing other related advancements.  While just scratching the surface of AI's enormous potential, Spotify's recent integration with ChatGPT offers a pathway to move fluidly from query and discovery to enjoyment of music—and all within a monetized ecosystem. 


HOW OUR ARTISTS CAN PARTICIPATE


Based on what we've done with our AI partners to date, and the new discussions that are underway, we can unequivocally say that AI has the potential to deliver creative tools that will enable us to connect our artists with their fans in new ways—and with advanced capability on a scale we've never encountered.  


Further, I believe that Agentic AI, which dynamically employs complex reasoning and adaptation, has the potential to revolutionize how fans interact with and discover music.


I know that we will successfully navigate as well as seize these opportunities and that these new products could constitute a significant source of new future revenue for artists and songwriters.  


We will be actively engaged in discussing all of these developments with the entire creative community.


While some of the biggest opportunities will require further exploration, we are excited by the compelling AI models we're seeing emerge.  


We will only consider advancing AI products based on models that are trained responsibly.  That is why we have entered into agreements with AI developers such as ProRata and KLAY, among others, and are in discussions with numerous additional like-minded companies whose products provide accurate attribution and tools which empower and compensate artists—products that both protect music and enhance its monetization.


And to be clear—and this is very important—we will NOT license any model that uses an artist's voice or generates new songs which incorporate an artist's existing songs without their consent.


New AI products will be joined by many other similar ones that will soon be coming to market, and we have established teams throughout UMG that will be working with artists and their representatives to bring these opportunities directly to them.


RESPONSIBLE PUBLIC POLICIES COVERING AI


We remain acutely aware of the fact that large and powerful AI companies are pressuring governments around the world to legitimize the training of AI technology on copyrighted material without owner consent or compensation, among other proposals.


To be clear: all these misguided proposals amount to nothing more than the unauthorized (and, we believe, illegal) exploitation of the rights and property of creative artists.


In addition, we are acting in the marketplace to see our partners embrace responsible and ethical AI policies and we're proud of the progress being made there.  For example, having accurately predicted the rapid rise of AI “slop” on streaming platforms, in 2023 we introduced Artist-Centric principles to combat what is essentially platform pollution.   Since then, many of our platform partners have made significant progress in putting in place measures to address the diversion of royalties, infringement and fraud—all to the benefit of the entire music ecosystem.


We commend our partners for taking action to address this urgent issue, consistent with our Artist-Centric approach.  Further, we recently announced an agreement with SoundPatrol, a new company led by Stanford scientists that employs patented technology to protect artists' work from unauthorized use in AI music generators.  


We are confident that by displaying our willingness as a community to embrace those commercial AI models which value and enhance human artistry, we are demonstrating that market-based solutions promoting innovation are the answer.  


LEADING THE WAY FORWARD


So,  as we work to assure safeguards for artists, we will help lead the way forward, which is why we are exploring and finding innovative ways to use this revolutionary technology to create new commercial opportunities for artists and songwriters while simultaneously aiding and protecting human creativity.    


I'm very excited about the products we're seeing and what the future holds.  I will update you all further on our progress.

Pucker up!

	You already know Queen Bey, now here comes King Lou. Louis Tomlinson just dropped the music video for his new song “Lemonade” — not to be confused with Beyoncé's iconic album of the same name — and it's truly wacky.


	The visual posted Monday (Oct. 13) opens with Tomlinson leaning against a car as a pesky photographer buzzes around him. He then falls asleep and wakes up inside a fever dream, surrounded by a group of people in full-body yellow suits. The group watches as a sock puppet opens up a lemonade stand for business and frolics around a lemon farm before Tomlinson dives into a swimming pool.

	











	“She's so bitter, she's so sweet/ Lemonade, lemonade,” he sings. “A little taste is all I need/ Lemonade, lemonade.”


	“Lemonade” serves as the lead single from Tomlinson's upcoming album, How Did I Get Here? The project — which drops Jan. 23, 2026 — will mark his third solo LP, and he has plans to embark on a North American tour in support of the album. He also will reunite with former One Direction bandmate Zayn Malik for an upcoming roadtrip docuseries on Netflix.


	But while there's much to be excited about on the horizon, How Did I Get Here? will also be the first album Tomlinson has dropped since the death of Liam Payne. In a recent Rolling Stone UK cover story, Tomlinson opened up about how the loss of his former bandmate has been “impossibly difficult.”

	











	“There's still a level in my head [where it feels] unjust and frustrating that he's not with us anymore,” he told the publication. “Naively, I thought that because at this point, I'm relatively well versed in grief for my age, that it might soften the blow. [That was] super-naive. It's very different. I've never lost a friend before.”

UPDATED: Media outlets ranging from The Atlantic to CNN to Newsmax have so far said that they do not plan for their correspondents to sign a new Pentagon press policy, arguing that it attempts to threaten access to the complex unless reporters agree to restrictions on how they have normally done their jobs.


The New York Times, The Washington Post and NPR also said that they would not sign, along with other outlets including The Hill and NewsNation.


	A spokesperson for Newsmax said on Monday, “Newsmax has no plans to sign the letter.  We are working in conjunction with other media outlets to resolve the situation. We believe the requirements are unnecessary and onerous and hope that the Pentagon will review the matter further.”

	A spokesperson for CNN said, “We will not be deflected from our duty to hold all three fairly and fully to account, and we will continue to report on the actions and decision-making processes of the U.S. government without fear or favor.”


	The Pentagon unveiled a new policy last month that required that information “be approved for public release by an appropriate authorizing official before it is released, even if it is unclassified.” The risk for news organizations that signed it was that their reporters could lose their credentials for access to the complex.


	Journalism groups consulted with Pentagon press officials about changes to the policy, but even after the revisions, still found it too restrictive.

	











	Last week, the Pentagon Press Association said that the policy still “leaves open the threat of the Department of Defense revoking credentials for reporters who exercise their First Amendment rights by seeking information that hasn't been pre-approved for formal release, even when the information is entirely unclassified.”


	The press association said that the policy also “conveys an unprecedented message of intimidation to everyone within the DoD, warning against unapproved interactions with the press and even suggesting it's criminal to speak without express permission — which plainly, it's not.” Some journalists argued that such activity as posting a call for tips on social media would run afoul of the rules.


	The deadline for signing is Tuesday.


	The press association, in a new statement issued on Monday, said that most of its members “seem likely to hand over their badges rather than acknowledge a policy that gags Pentagon employees and threatens retaliation against reporters who seek out information that has not been pre-approved for release.” 


	Richard Stevenson, Washington bureau chief for The New York Times, said that the policy threatens to punish journalists “for ordinary news gathering protected by the First Amendment. Since the policy was first announced, we have expressed concerns that it constrains how journalists can report on the U.S. military, which is funded by $1 trillion in taxpayer dollars annually.”


	Some outlets, like CBS News, NBC News and Fox News, have yet to say whether their reporters would sign the policy.


	An outlet that is signing is One America News Network. “After thorough review of the revised press policy by our attorney, OAN staff has signed the document,” the network's Charles Herring said in a statement.


	Throughout the day on Monday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has responded to news outlets announcing their refusal to sign with a hand “bye-bye” emoji.


	He wrote, “Pentagon access is a privilege, not a right. So, here is @DeptofWar press credentialing FOR DUMMIES: Press no longer roams free. Press must wear visible badge. Credentialed press no longer permitted to solicit criminal acts. DONE. Pentagon now has same rules as every U.S. military installation.”


	But some veterans of the Pentagon press corps said that Hegseth is wrong, in that the press already has been displaying badges. nor did they have access to areas like classified spaces.


	Weijia Jiang, president of the White House Correspondents' Association, and Shaun Tandon, president of the State Department Correspondents' Association, said in a joint statement, “Access inside the Pentagon has never been about convenience to reporters. The public has a right to know how the government is conducting the people's business. Unfettered reporting on the U.S. military and its civilian leadership provides a service to those in uniform, veterans, their families and all Americans.”

I thought MAGA was about transparency.

Betcha ABC and CBS sign.

Can't wait for Hesgeth to go to jail when this is all over.

Here's hoping.

“veterans of the Pentagon said that Hegseth is wrong” – that could also be his epitaph.

Food for those news outlets.
Somewhat surprised one or two of them didn't bend a knee but not complaining.

Associate Editor, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Millie Bobby Brown (Stranger Things, Enola Holmes) will star in and executive produce the new series Prism, currently in development at Netflix, sources close to the production reveal to Deadline. Rachel Brosnahan and AGBO, in their third project with the streamer, will also executive produce.


	Etan Frankel (Shameless, Joe vs. Carole) has been tapped as showrunner.


	Netflix declined comment.


	Brown will play Cassie, a woman with the unique ability to communicate with apparitions, who must uncover the cause of a newly discovered phenomenon that causes “visitors” (ghosts) to appear all over the world before it's too late.

	Executive producers include Brown through her PCMA banner; Brosnahan and Russell Kahn via Scrap Paper Pictures; Anthony Russo, Joe Russo, Angela Russo-Otstot, Scott Nemes and Alessandra Maman on behalf of AGBO; and Jack Heller and Caitlin de Lisser-Ellen of Assemble Media.


	We understand that if the project goes to series, starring in Prism will not prevent Brown from keeping her commitments to previously announced projects. This is her second collaboration with AGBO, following her lead role in Netflix's The Electric State, the Russo brothers' most recent film.


Prism expands Brown's long and successful collaboration with Netflix that began with her starring role as Eleven in the smash hit Stranger Things, due to conclude its run with a fifth season to be released in three parts in November and December. Also hugely popular are Brown's Enola Holmes franchise films, two of which are currently available to stream with a third expected to premiere in 2026.

	











	Brosnahan's breakout role was in Netflix's House of Cards; she appeared in an episode of Orange is the New Black and starred in the streamer's film Saturn Return alongside Charles Melton and Will Poulter. She is best known for playing the lead in Prime Video's Emmy-winning period dramedy The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. She most recently played Lois Lane in James Gunn's Superman. Up next, Brosnahan will star in and executive produce the sophomore season of Apple TV's Presumed Innocent.


	AGBO is currently producing Marvel's Avengers: Doomsday in London, to be followed up by Avengers: Secret Wars (2027), with the Russos directing. The studio recently released The Electric State for Netflix, which premiered as the platform's No. 1 film, and wrapped The Bluff for Amazon MGM and The Whisper Man for Netflix. Citadel Season 2 for Prime Video is currently in post-production. AGBO also collaborated with Netflix on The Gray Man (2022) feature starring Ryan Gosling, Chris Evans and Ana de Armas.


	Frankel is currently an executive producer on Big Mistakes for Netflix, with Dan Levy writing and attached to star. Most recently, he spent four years in an overall deal at UCP. While there, he was the creator/showrunner of Joe vs. Carole for Peacock. Previously, he was an EP on Get Shorty for Epix/MGM, two seasons on Animal Kingdom and on Showtime's Shameless, where he wrote for seven seasons.

					By Armando Tinoco 

Staff Writer


Nancy Meyers is the latest to pay tribute to Diane Keaton, honoring her legacy in Hollywood following Keaton's death on Saturday at age 79


	The filmmaker took to social media to share her thoughts on Keaton after processing the news.


	“These past 48 hours have not been easy. Seeing all of your tributes to Diane has been a comfort,” Meyers posted on Instagram. “As a movie lover, I'm with you all — we have lost a giant. A brilliant actress who time and again laid herself bare to tell our stories. As a woman, I lost a friend of almost 40 years — at times over those years, she felt like a sister because we shared so many truly memorable experiences.”

	











	Meyers and Keaton first worked together in 1987's Baby Boom and would collaborate again in 1991's Father of the Bride. In 1995, Meyers and Keaton reunited for Father of the Bride II and again in 2003 for Something's Gotta Give.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“As a filmmaker, I've lost a connection with an actress that one can only dream of. We all search for that someone who really gets us, right? Well, with Diane, I believe we mutually had that,” she continued. “I always felt she really got me so writing for her made me better because I felt so secure in her hands. I knew how vulnerable she could be. And I knew how hilarious she could be, not only with dialogue (which she said word for word as written but managed to always make it sound improvised) but she could be funny sitting at a dinner table or just walking into a room.”

	Meyers went on to note Keaton's professionalism on the set, saying that “she made everything better” and saw her “give it her all” every day they worked together.


	“When I needed her to cry in scene after scene in Something's Gotta Give she went at it hard and then somehow made it funny,” Meyers said. “And I remember she would sometimes spin in a kind of goofy circle before a take to purposely get herself off balance or whatever she needed to shed so she could be in the moment. She was fearless, she was like nobody ever, she was born to be a movie star, her laugh could make your day and for me, knowing her and working with her — changed my life. Thank you Di. I'll miss you forever.”

	When Democratic political strategist Maria Cardona blasted the Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions for violating citizens' rights, the Trump administration responded with a quote from Billy Madison.


	After appearing on CNN on Monday morning, Cardona posted on X, “ICE is engaging in egregious, criminal behavior, violating peoples' civil rights, kidnapping, and snatching innocent men, women, and children off the streets, even detaining American citizens! While doing it, not identifying themselves, hiding their faces, not telling people why they are being taken. This is not normal! This is not American! This is not acceptable! And videotaping these agents, asking them questions, and even hollering that they should not be doing this, does not in any way constitute a ‘violent attack' against these agents! It is part of the Constitution, to peacefully protest violent behavior against innocent people, and American citizens!”

	The Department of Homeland Security responded, “What you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things Americans have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent statement were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone is now dumber for having listened to it.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	That is a quote from the 1995 Adam Sandler comedy, in which the principal tells him, “Mr. Madison, what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.”

	











	In the DHS statement, the department argued that “far from engaging in criminal behavior, federal law enforcement actions have significantly REDUCED crime in the cities we have been deployed to. Locking up criminals works, imagine that.”


	But DHS did not address Cardona's criticisms that non-violent legal immigrants and even citizens have been caught up in ICE raids, by what amounts to a secret police force given the lack of uniforms or other information. Videos collected by bystanders have popped up every day showing some of the raids. Last week, a video surfaced of an ICE officer who shot a member of the clergy with a pepper ball who had been outside a processing facility just outside Chicago. ICE spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin later said that “these agitators were blocking an ICE vehicle from leaving the federal facility — impeding operations.”


	In response to the DHS message, Cardona wrote, “Really @DHSgov? You respond with a quote from Billy Madison? That proves just how unserious, sophomoric, and incompetent you all are. Which would be funny if you all weren't so deadly dangerous to the communities you are terrorizing! You are also dead wrong! The vast majority of the ppl you are detaining ARE NOT violent criminals, 93% have no violent criminal history whatsoever! There are REAMS of videos of you slamming women, children, and elderly ppl to the ground, shooting pepper balls at priests, even kidnapping American citizens!! THAT is not acceptable, it IS criminal and it is UNAMERICAN!”

ICE are nothing but a bunch of fascist thugs. No, scratch that. The entire Trump administration is a bunch of fascist thugs. They should be arrested for treason.

CNN has a declining share of a small market. They won't be around in 10 years. And that quote is hilarious. You weirdos freaking out only makes the response that much better.

Are you aware that you are on the wrong side of history? Or do you just not care?

Idiocracy is a documentary.

I hate what they said but I love the way they said it.

CNN won't exist in 5 years.

Neither will MAGA.

And yet JD Vance will serving his first term as president.

And that would be the very END of the United States of America, as there is little unity presently, and absolutely none at that point.

Apple TV+ is undergoing a makeover. The streamer has dropped the plus sign and is now simply Apple TV, “with a vibrant new identity.”


	The news was quietly revealed in its press release announcing the F1: The Movie streaming date with no additional details.


	Apple launched the streaming service on Nov. 1, 2019 with eight original series (seven scripted and one unscripted) and one original documentary, including The Morning Show, For All Mankind, See, Servant and Dickinson.


	Apple made history as the first streaming service to land the Academy Award for Best Picture with CODA. Apple Original Film The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse also earned the Academy Award for Best Animated Short, and Killers of the Flower Moon landed 10 Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture.

Drop the plus, increase the price.  That's usually how this goes, no?

Makes sense since they never used Plus in their hashtags.

Okay but where is the season 5 trailer For All Mankind?  It's been in post production for a year now. Apple is puposely holding back FAM until the Star City spin-off is ready which is bullshit.

So now how are they going to distinguish formerly-Plus offerings from their Amazon-like buy/rent-only offerings? Always hated that about both Apple and Prime–it's never immediately clear what comes with the plan and what's only available piecemeal. And this change will only complicate that further.

When are they releasing Outcome?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Whitney Cummings calls critics of Riyadh Comedy Festival ""racist""","https://www.avclub.com/whitney-cummings-riyadh-comedy-festival-critics-racist","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 16:20:00 GMT","

Whitney Cummings knew addressing the topic of the Riyadh Comedy Festival on her podcast would generate headlines—”You know what, I don't think I need to address it, you guys got it all figured out,” she said sarcastically on the latest episode of Good For You. “I guess I'm this weirdo, I don't operate under the idea that every government and their people are the same.” The comedian went on to accuse critics of the festival of ignorance and hypocrisy. “It's just racism,” she said, suggesting the backlash was only because the festival took place in the Middle East.

Separating the audience from the regime is a tact several of the other comedians on the Riyadh lineup have taken, including Louis C.K. and Aziz Ansari. Bill Burr characterized the backlash against him as people saying, “How dare you go to that place and make those oppressed people laugh, you fucking piece of shit. I can't believe you went to that place. I can't find it on a map, and this bot said I was upset about it so now I am.” Yet the criticism was less about doing comedy for an audience of Saudi citizens and more about taking money directly from the Saudi Arabian government for an event that Human Rights Watch says “whitewashes” the abuses perpetrated by that government.

But Cummings had an answer for that, and an answer to the criticism of Riyadh coming from within the comedy world. “By the way, any comic that has ever worked with Live Nation—which is all of them—has taken Saudi money, but keep with your little rants,” she said. “When you get a sec, google ‘Saudi Arabia Live Nation' so you can be informed on the fact that anyone who has worked with Live Nation, every stand-up comic, has taken Saudi money. … Or bought a ticket through Live Nation, went to a Live Nation event, all the actors who are represented by William Morris Agency, which is all of them. If you want to send them notes too.” 

Cummings has become more political (and, often, more right-leaning) in her material recently. Her New Year's set on CNN touched on several conspiracy theories, including bits about the Pfizer vaccine and the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. After the death of Charlie Kirk, she posted on Twitter/X that the shooter “could have done it privately but chose to do it publicly in front of kids. If you are happy about this you're also pro child trauma.” It's unclear if she was joking or sincere, but either way, the post garnered backlash. 

“I'm trying to help you sound less racist,” Cummings shot back at her critics. She described those who took issue with her participation in the Riyadh Comedy Festival as nepo babies (“People whose dads have points on huge television shows are like, ‘I have a backup plan, a huge trust fund, you're a sellout for making money'”), comics who wish they were invited to the festival, and “the same people who are like, if they found out a Fox journalist was murdered, they would truly throw a party.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Will Arnett is a stand-up guy in Bradley Cooper's modest dramedy Is This Thing On?","https://www.avclub.com/is-this-thing-on-review","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 18:00:00 GMT","

Bradley Cooper is an actor's director. That was made abundantly clear at a press conference for his new movie Is This Thing On?, premiering as the closing night selection for the New York Film Festival, as his performers spoke effusively about how the closeness of Cooper's camera, the flow of the film's shoot, and indie ethos combined to create a feeling of the performers and filmmakers working together as “one big organism,” as Laura Dern put it. Is This Thing On? also marks the first time that Cooper has exercised these techniques for leads that don't include himself. Cooper's supporting part in the movie as a bearded, secondary goofball suggests that, in addition to writing and directing, he's also held the ambition to steal parts away from Jason Mantzoukas. His character is also an actor.

The film's leads, however, actually drift away from the showbiz environment of Cooper's first two big-swing features. One of the very first things we learn about Alex Novak (Will Arnett) as the movie opens is that he's heading toward divorce from his wife Tess (Laura Dern). That information crystallizes far sooner than what it is that either of them does for a living, or how old their two children are. They're both 10—not born at the same time but “Irish twins,” which is something we learn from Alex's stand-up routine. Comedy is not, however, Alex's actual profession; he has some kind of nebulous finance job that's supposed to be beside the point of his journey, but reads a little like Cooper saying, “I don't know, people have jobs with money, right?” Alex tries out stand-up on a whim, supposedly to avoid the $15 cover charge at a bar where he just wants to drown a little of his post-split misery. (He's living nearby in that reverse-NYC miracle, an apartment described as shabby but actually pretty nice, while Tess stays in the suburbs.)

Alex is believably shaky his first time up at an open mic. But he also shows enough of a glimmer of talent, and bares just enough of his soul through a couple of divorce jokes, to suggest a creative breakthrough that's been a long time coming, whether he realized it or not. He goes back for another shot of that adrenaline, and Cooper smartly depicts how intoxicating even a moderate hit of crowd approval can be under the right circumstances. Working from a screenplay he and Arnett wrote with Mark Chappell, inspired by English comedian John Bishop, Cooper doesn't throw Alex into a Star Is Born-style rags-to-riches story (not least because Alex is, by most standards, already rich). He doesn't even quit his job to pursue comedy, and it's neat to see Cooper working in a less operatic tone, his self-consciously artsy flourishes in support of a story that doesn't announce its own sober-faced importance. The casting of Arnett matches this scale-down perfectly; he's naturally funny, yet has enough human frailty to believably play a guy who's more of a promising talent than a comedic supernova.

Cooper also seems mindful of the potential limits of another story where a middle-aged guy finds his spark again, if not fully certain how to turn Is This Thing On? into his desired marriage story. Tess gets her own storyline, sort of, where she belatedly reclaims some of her lost satisfaction by coaching volleyball, the sport she once played at an Olympic level. But her coaching journey doesn't have the equivalents of crowded following shots or intimate close-ups in the bustle of the Comedy Cellar on a busy night. It's mostly an unexplained decade-plus delay in Tess realizing that, hey, sometimes former athletes turn to coaching, and then finding instant success in her new field.

As insufferable as it might have been to eavesdrop on too many real-life comics plying their trade alongside and offering insider wisdom to Arnett's enthusiastic newbie, that milieu is also where Is This Thing On? feels most electric, even unpredictable once it's clear, early on, that this won't end with Alex getting that Tonight Show gig. When it turns back to the complicated dynamic between Alex and Tess, Arnett and Dern are both excellent. (Somewhat perversely, Arnett might get more credit just for being an often-comic actor holding his own opposite an always-great Oscar winner.) What Cooper has to say about the thorniness of marriage, children, and the difficulties of basic human happiness, though, feels a little murky, and not in a rife-with-rich-ambiguities sort of way. Is This Thing On? obviously prides itself in dropping into the action without a lot of exposition, yet Cooper can't resist circling back for some arguments that fill in those missing details.

At their most clamorous, the family conflicts taste like warmed-over David O. Russell leftovers, without reaching the rococo heights of those films' wigged-out performances (including Cooper's in several of them). The lack of genuine messiness makes this one of several recent movies that guides characters through narratives like a therapy session, complete with an end-of-session mixture of neatness and ellipses, along with a sense that the supporting characters are just fodder for intense discussion rather than recognizable humans. Is This Thing On? might come to its healing from an appropriately modest place, but there's still a bit of actorly grandiosity under its skin.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Praise the Demogorgon: Stranger Things ' final season runtimes are shorter than feared","https://www.avclub.com/stranger-things-runtimes-ross-duffer-reveal","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 23:34:00 GMT","

The scariest thing about Stranger Things‘ fourth season was the episode runtimes. We weren't the A.V. Club to notice that the bloated runtimes had an adverse effect on the show's narrative flow. As the premiere of Stranger Things 5 approaches, the collective members of the Hawkins A.V. Club have spent months biting their nails at the prospect of another season filled with episodes that run upwards of 98 minutes—not to mention a two-and-a-half-hour finale. That's too many Eggos for a single Stephen King fanatic. Thankfully, in hopes of quelling the slow wave of anxiety cresting on his TV show's fanbase, Stranger Things co-creator Ross Duffer posted the “ACTUAL” episode lengths on his Instagram page earlier today, and let's just say they're shorter than last season.

In a post captioned “ACTUAL runtimes,” Duffer revealed that the first three Chapters of season five run 68 minutes or less. However, one can see runtime creep infiltrating his editing process because the part one finale (yeah, this Stranger Things is another split season deal) clocks in at one hour and 23 minutes. Is that a sign of things to come? Should we clear our schedules for part two? Please, Mr. Duffer, tell us how we should conduct our lives. We're hopeless over here.

Anyway, here are the runtimes for your TV scheduling purposes:

Chapter One: 68 minutes
Chapter Two: 54 minutes
Chapter Three: 66 minutes
Chapter Four: 83 minutes

Per Variety, the post offers some relief from reports that each episode would run between 90 minutes and two hours. Season four saw the Duffers really stretch these episodes out, with all but one episode running longer than 70 minutes. Given that they're using the more consistent and reasonable runtimes as part of their personal promotion for the show, the Duffers have heard you, they've seen you, and they're making changes.

For those who still have their calendars open, the first part of Stranger Things 5 premieres on November 26, and the final three episodes will premiere on December 31. Those episodes better be short, too, because no one wants to enter the new year with episodes of Stranger Things hanging over them.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","John Oliver examines Bari Weiss' ""irresponsible,"" ""deeply misleading"" work ahead of CBS News takeover","https://www.avclub.com/john-oliver-bari-weiss-cbs-news-editor-in-chief","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 16:30:00 GMT","

New Paramount chief David Ellison has “resting just checked into the White Lotus face,” but that's not even close to the most off-putting thing about him, according to John Oliver. The CEO promised to root out DEI at the company and installed a conservative ombudsman to evaluate “bias” in CBS' news coverage, but he didn't stop there. Recently, Ellison made the decision to buy controversial ex-New York Times columnist Bari Weiss' The Free Press for $150 million and instill its founder as CBS News' new editor-in-chief. It's a move Oliver wasn't thrilled about, to say the very least. It galled the Last Week Tonight host so much, in fact, that he spent almost his entire 30-plus minute monologue ragging on everything from her “self-aggrandizing” description of her resignation from The New York Times as a moment “heard 'round the world” to her egregious mis-characterization of Manhattan's Upper West Side as merely “Seinfeld territory.” (“It's the site of many other cultural touchstones!”)

Pivoting to address the gravity of the issue at hand, Oliver then spent a large chunk of his monologue pointing out a number of the ways The Free Press‘ stories—including impactful posts like an article alleging malnourished kids in Gaza were suffering from pre-existing health conditions other than starvation and another that made refuted claims about the families of trans youth—don't hold up to journalistic scrutiny in their general mission to suggest that “the left has gone too far.” (“I am not saying the left never goes too far or is immune from criticism at all,” Oliver qualified. “But it can sometimes feel like The Free Press‘ conclusions can get out ahead of its evidence.”)

“The truth is, we wouldn't even have done this story were it not for the fact that Bari Weiss has just been named editor-in-chief of CBS News. And that feels different,” Oliver continued. “Because there are many opinion-heavy outlets out there, from left to right, and with low to high editorial standards. This show is, among other things, an opinion outlet. And while our staff works incredibly hard to research stories before we write something and vigorously check our facts afterwards, we're also not the news.” Oliver wouldn't want anyone running a “pure opinion outlet”—even someone he agreed with—to suddenly have control of the editorial direction of Face The Nation, 60 Minutes, and more, “but it is especially alarming to have someone doing it who has spent years putting out work that—in my opinion—is at best, irresponsible, and at worst, deeply misleading.” 

And even that perhaps isn't the worst thing Ellison has done. “It is not just about Bari Weiss being at CBS. It is about the fact that CBS is now under the control of someone who thinks that she and her editorial sensibility make her a good fit for the job, and who, incidentally, is now preparing a bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, home of CNN and, uh-oh, HBO. Which isn't ideal,” Oliver continued of Ellison's reported attempt to absorb his home network.

“It is worth keeping an eye out for subtle changes there, because while I'm sure many of CBS News' good journalists will continue to do great work, if you start seeing people resigning or getting fired, or you start seeing stories that seem off in some way, especially if it involves the left going too far on a topic Bari Weiss cares about, it's worth asking yourself why that might be,” he concluded. “Because unfortunately, the much bigger answer might be that a billionaire has chosen to inject contrarian, right-leaning opinion journalism into an American icon.”

Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson were co-stars in the 2003 romantic comedy, “Something's Gotta Give.” The pair delivered incredible performances, and the film was a hit, even earning Keaton an Academy Award nomination. However, there was one thing that the actress failed to do when signing onto the film: she did not negotiate a back end to her contract. 

Keaton revealed this information in her memoir “Then Again,” which was published in 2011. 

In Keaton's memoir, she revealed how she earned significantly less than her co-star. But Nicholson would do something that left Keaton pleasantly surprised. In her memoir, she wrote about her shock “when a check with a lot of zeros arrived in the mail for my back-end percentage,” Daily Mail reports. 

The money had come from Nicholson's “hefty percentage of the film's gross earnings,” Daily Mail reports. In Keaton's memoir, she also revealed that she had initially thought the film would not do well at the box office but called it her “favorite film,” The Guardian reports. 

Keaton's acting was so convincing that Nicholson even believed she was in love with him. “We're rehearsing that scene in the street, where he's running after her, and he calls me over after one rehearsal. He's all rattled,” director Nancy Meyers said at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2018, Vulture reports. 

“I said, ‘What's up?' And he goes, ‘Diane just told me she loves me.' I couldn't tell if he was horrified or thrilled. So I was like, ‘Yes, I know, I wrote that line. It's in the script, Jack.' And he said, ‘Oh, okay.' He thought she meant it. It's really funny. That's her.”

Keaton had an impressive career, and fans have taken a closer look at her life and the impact she had on Hollywood after her passing on October 11. She was 79. The world has reacted with great sadness to Keaton's death, and a friend shared more information about the type of person she was. 

“She lived exactly how she wanted to, which was on her own terms, surrounded by the people and things she really loved,” the friend said, People reports. “Being in the spotlight wasn't important,” the source revealed, saying that Keaton loved being home with her golden retriever, Reggie. 

The friend continued, “Diane always had a very strong sense of who she was and how she wanted to live. In these last few years, she kept a close circle, and she liked it that way. She was funny right up until the end, and she had this way of making even ordinary moments feel special. That was just who she was.”

Thank you for all the entertainment in my life from you.I have your movies that I replay (when I'm down) they always make me laugh and smile 😃 at the world again.RIP MsKeaton and may G-D hold you and welcome you!! AA Bluhm

Do you mean GOD or G-D?

The music world has faced a loss—British DJ and producer Matt Tolfrey has passed away at the age of 44, as confirmed by DJMag. The founder of Leftroom Records was beloved throughout the global electronic music scene for his talent, humor, and generosity of spirit. News of his passing was shared by his close friend and collaborator Damian Lazarus, who posted an emotional tribute on Instagram Monday.

A post shared by Damian Lazarus (@damian_lazarus)

“This weekend we lost a key member of the extended Crosstown Rebels family,” Lazarus wrote. “Matt Tolfrey played a major role in our music scene and will be very sorely missed.”

A post shared by Data Transmission (@datatransmission)

Lazarus went on to reflect on their two decades of friendship and collaboration. “He produced key singles and remixes for us and helped bring together so many artists who shared his love for the music,” he said. “Matt believed in community and in connecting people both on and off the dancefloor.”

He closed his message with a heartfelt farewell: “His cheeky smile and humor will be sorely missed. My heart goes out to everyone who knew and loved Matt, especially his beautiful daughters, Arla and Beau. RIP Matt, you left the room too early.”

A post shared by Soundermag – Magazine & Events (@soundermag)

Born in 1980, Tolfrey grew up in Bahrain before returning to the U.K. as a teenager, according to The Daily Mail. His DJ career began while studying in Nottingham, where he quickly made a name for himself playing at The Bomb. His big break came in 2004 after a chance call from Fabric's Craig Richards, who invited him to perform at the iconic London club.

“That's how it all began,” he told DJ Magazine in 2012. “Once I played at Fabric, I started getting booked elsewhere because it was such a big thing.”

Tolfrey went on to produce music for respected labels like Crosstown Rebels, REKIDS, and Phonica before founding Leftroom Records. He released his debut album Word of Mouth in 2012 and followed it with All Shapes and Sizes in 2020.

A post shared by Clara Da Costa (@claradacosta_official)

Following his passing, tributes poured in from fellow artists and industry peers. Classic Music Company wrote, “Classic are devastated to hear of the passing of Matt Tolfrey; DJ, producer, label runner, manager, and importantly our friend.”

They added, “Matt was a longtime supporter and fan of all things Classic. We have fond memories of the times he played for us and when we all hung out. We send love to all of Matt's friends and family.”

DJ Heidi also remembered her friend with touching words: “Matt Tolfrey was someone whom I gravitated towards immediately. His humor was infectious. He was such a fun person to be around and unbelievably kind.”

A post shared by HEIDI (@djheidi)

She added, “We played together so many times across this planet. My heart goes out to Hayley and his beautiful daughters. This is beyond heartbreaking. Make sure you tell your friends and family how much you love them. Life is precious.”

Throughout his two-decade career, Tolfrey became known for his authenticity, passion for collaboration, and ability to unite artists around the world. His music, laughter, and legacy will continue to echo through dancefloors for years to come.

As Lazarus so poignantly said, “Matt left the room too early — but the rhythm he created will never fade.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Gigi Hadid Shares Sweet Words for Boyfriend Bradley Cooper on His Big Night","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/gigi-hadid-honors-bradley-cooper-premiere/","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 16:31:47 GMT","

Gigi Hadid just proved she's boyfriend Bradley Cooper's biggest fan. The 30-year-old supermodel skipped the red carpet but still found a heartfelt way to celebrate her boyfriend at the October 10 premiere of his new film “Is This Thing On?”

“Premiere night! Congratulations to my love!” Hadid wrote on her Instagram Stories, sharing a photo of a large TV playing the film, as reported by E! Online. She also congratulated stars Laura Dern, Will Arnett, Andra Day, and “the whole crew.”

Hadid and Cooper, who have quietly been together for nearly two years, rarely share glimpses of their relationship. Her loving message was a rare and touching show of support that delighted fans.

Cooper, 50, revealed that his 8-year-old daughter, Lea, whom he shares with ex Irina Shayk, has become a big part of his creative process.

“She's part of it,” he told E! News at the 63rd New York Film Festival. “I was making A Star Is Born when she was born, and then Maestro, she's in. There's nothing weird about it. It's just part of what we do, and it's kind of a nice thing.”

Cooper added that Lea even helps him with casting decisions. “Kids, they say exactly what they think, and she has a big opinion about everything. I love it and I care what she thinks. Even with casting, we'll look at auditions together.”

Hadid recently opened up about how Cooper's creative spirit has inspired her to take more risks. The mom of one auditioned for Rapunzel in Disney's live-action Tangled, telling Vogue, “I was really proud of my scene. I knew they were going to go with a real singer.”

“I respect him so much as a creative,” Hadid added. “He gives me so much encouragement and belief. For those people you admire to encourage you, it can create so much belief in yourself. You just take the leap.”

The couple confirmed their romance in early 2024 when they were spotted holding hands in London. Weeks later, they celebrated Valentine's Day in New York City, walking arm-in-arm in matching outfits.

Cooper later supported Hadid at her Guest in Residence boutique in February, proudly standing by her side.

A post shared by Gigi Hadid (@gigihadid)

Now, as the two continue to balance busy careers and parenthood, they continue to show support for each other.

It wasn't long ago that Apple looked like it would be making a big push into theatrical releases, believing what has been true for most other distributors: a theatrical release and its subsequent marketing push helps a movie's cachet once it (eventually) lands on streaming later. It worked with other studios — mixing up the partner on each — on the release of films like “Killers of the Flower Moon” (Paramount), “Napoleon” (Sony), and “Argylle” (Universal). And with “F1: The Movie” in partnership with yet another distributor in Warner Bros., it found its biggest hit to date — and quietly one of its biggest successes of the year at the box office — grossing $629 million worldwide.

 








Related Stories This Is a Cinderella Story the Film Industry Needs The Camera He Wasn't Allowed to Touch: First-Person Storytelling from a Grand Slam Winner of The Moth 

Apple rewarded that success with a run in theaters that has lasted 14+ weeks, even as the film has already been available for premium rental since August. Few filmmakers get that sort of runway, but for Joseph Kosinski, who certainly did for “Top Gun: Maverick,” they were willing to give him the privilege, and his movie made the most of it.

 










Now Apple has finally announced a release date for the movie on streaming on what is now just Apple TV (not Apple TV+), hitting the service globally on December 12. It'll be nearly six months since the film opened on June 27; a theatrical window like that is virtually unheard of.

But that's no guarantee the same will happen to an Apple movie again. Despite its success, it wouldn't be a surprise if the “F1” theatrical experiment is over.

Within a matter of months of each other, both Apple and Amazon were reported to be dipping their toes into theatrical releases. After some success with “Air” and a few others, Amazon MGM is now all in, targeting as many as 14 theatrical releases a year and offering them beefy theatrical windows before they land on streaming. The studio is still doing some direct-to-streaming movies, but it has made clear its priorities. 

Apple, on the other hand, before “F1” had a string of costly misses and has since been rolling back that approach. The losses for movies like “Argylle” and “Fly Me to the Moon” were well-documented, and the straw that broke the camel's back was its approach with the George Clooney-Brad Pitt thriller “Wolfs.” That movie was going to have a robust theatrical release up until Apple yanked the rug out at the last minute and said it would drop on streaming after little more than a week. The studio tried to placate the filmmakers by saying it had already greenlit a sequel to “Wolfs,” but director Jon Watts openly said that after the theatrical fiasco, he “no longer trusted” Apple as a creative partner.

 










Since then, some of its higher-profile films have all been quietly and modestly released in theaters before landing on streaming, if they got a theatrical release at all, a stark contrast to what was agreed upon and stuck to with “F1.” Spike Lee's “Highest 2 Lowest” spent a couple weeks in theaters, grossing just a reported $1.5 million, before hitting the streaming service. Paul Greengrass' “The Lost Bus” did the same, opening in just a few select theaters and did not report box office totals. 

Apple is not under the same pressure as its peers to produce for the box office and hope that streaming can pick up the slack. Back in March, a report suggested that Apple TV loses $1 billion a year on streaming and has in the vicinity of 45 million subscribers. It's fine operating it as a loss-leader and using it as a means to continue selling iPhones. 

The company also has never been bound to one approach, and it stands to reason that, if another project on the scale of “F1” with a director like Kosinski attached was on the table, it could pursue a similarly lengthy theatrical release strategy. Some of its upcoming movies sound like they could have that pedigree. There's the Skydance-produced “Mayday” starring Ryan Reynolds, the Mattel movie “Matchbox” starring John Cena, and the Ben Stiller and Jake Johnson pickleball comedy “The Dink.” Have we mentioned movie theaters need more comedies like that last one?

Former Disney film chief Sean Bailey's first movie to be released upon taking the job at Disney was “Tron: Legacy,” a big swing based on the long-dormant cult property “Tron” from 1982. That film, about a human who gets sucked into a computer, was a pioneer for digital effects and became a cult favorite after its initial release, and “Legacy” aimed to be just as daring in its use of CGI, motion capture, and 3D, ultimately bringing in $400 million worldwide in 2010.

Perhaps fittingly, one of Bailey's last project upon his exit last year is “Tron: Ares,” which opened this weekend. But with underwhelming reviews, a tenuous connection to the original beyond a brief Jeff Bridges appearance, and a story that takes the “Tron” light cycles into the real world rather than try and innovate further into the digital realm, are we surprised that this sequel to a niche, cult hit underwhelmed audiences?

“Tron: Ares” made $33.5 million domestic and $60.5 million globally. It was an under-performance after it was expected the Jared Leto-starring film would make between $40-45 million at home and between $80-90 million worldwide. “Tron: Legacy” managed to open to $44 million back in 2010 which, with inflation, would be closer to $65 million today.

 










Granted, a lot of things underwhelmed at the box office this weekend. Paramount and Miramax's “Roofman” opened to just $8 million domestic. “One Battle After Another” brought in $6.6 million, a modest total but not the number you want to see if it were to be a “Sinners” level hit, and Roadside Attractions' “Kiss of the Spider Woman” with Jennifer Lopez did not even crack the Top 10 and made a dismal $918K in its opening.

But the “Tron: Ares” number is especially dispiriting. “Tron: Ares” is the latest in a string of not=terrible but-not-great Disney releases in 2025, the exception being “Lilo & Stitch.” Both of the summer Marvel titles “Fantastic Four: First Steps” and “Thunderbolts*” are miles away from the high water mark of something like “Deadpool & Wolverine.” “Snow White” struck out early in the year, and “Elio” is one of the lowest-grossing Pixar movies ever. 

Again, tentpoles need to tentpole if the box office wants to see growth on 2024.

“Ares” has a production budget of $180 million, so this will surely be headed to a loss. IMAX screenings accounted for $6.6 million of its domestic haul, or 20 percent of the total, so it will take an even bigger blow long term if it loses some of those premium screens. Audiences gave it a B+ CinemaScore, which is fine, but doesn't necessarily inspire great word of mouth, especially when we're talking about what you would hope would attract a cult audience.

 










What was one of the bigger selling points for “Tron: Ares”? Not strictly its visuals, its cast, or its plot, but instead its industrial rock score from Nine Inch Nails, the first not billed to Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross but instead to their band. Disney turned to NIN after the composers for the much ballyhooed “Legacy” score, Daft Punk, have long since broken up. I like “Head Like a Hole” as much as the next guy, but that alone does not a mainstream hit make.

Up next for Disney, 20th Century Studios is releasing the music biopic and awards-hopeful “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere,” it has another sequel/spinoff in “Predator: Badlands,” the animated “Zootopia 2,” and “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” If any of those underperform the way “Tron: Ares” did, then we have some problems.

Tim Robinson and Zach Kanin's “The Chair Company” is a comedic gift that keeps on giving. It gives the minds behind “I Think You Should Leave” and “Friendship” a canvas to tell a long-form narrative story with their distinct brand of cringe-inducing comedy. It gives Robinson one of the best roles of his career as a suburban mall planner who turns his quiet family life upside down to investigate a criminal conspiracy stemming from an embarrassing moment he suffers at work. But perhaps most importantly, it delivers a smorgasbord of Robinson, Kanin, and director Andrew DeYoung's most underrated comedic trick: fake company names.

 










Over the course of three seasons, “I Think You Should Leave” has introduced us to a corporate world that includes names like Corncob TV, Dan Flashes, Darmine Devices, Stanzo Brand Fedoras, TK Jewelers, L&L Limos, Avani Suits, Club Aqua (and its sister nightlife venue Club Haunted House), and Mason's Traveling Corporate Competitions. Sometimes, these companies are the focal point of a sketch, and other times, they're just mentioned in passing. Yet they always add narrative texture that helps explain why this fictional world always manages to confuse and infuriate Robinson's characters in equal measure.

The brilliance isn't limited to the world of “I Think You Should Leave.” DeYoung's “Friendship” saw Robinson's character obsess over the fictional clothing brand Ocean View Dining and the extensive menu options at a local eatery called Rick's Bar. And as the name suggests, “The Chair Company” is filled with companies like the customer service conglomerate National Business Solutions, the architectural firm Fisher Robay, and of course, Tecca Chairs, which serves as the show's primary antagonist. 

The show's conspiracy thriller angle, in which Ron's failures to speak with a human being in Tecca's customer service department lead him down an all-consuming rabbit hole of more sinister characters, isolates one of the distinct features of Robinson's comedy: the everyman trying to fit into a world of faceless companies that seem determined to make things difficult for him. Whether he's trying to figure out why he's not allowed to say “cumshot” on an adult tour where profanity is allegedly permitted or lamenting that his first date in 10 years was ruined by the fact that his jewelry, limousine, and suit providers were all out to scam him, Robinson's characters are often defined by their interactions with businesses.

Robinson and Kanin's fake companies can often be divided into two categories: the comically large and faceless, and the ridiculously small and lowbrow. For every National Business Solutions and Darmine Devices that appear impenetrable in their genericness, there's a small-time local establishment finding a way to sell a mediocre product to Robinson. One of the best jokes in the duo's entire filmography comes in the “Studio Audience” sketch in Season 3, Episode 2 of “I Think You Should Leave” when a TV producer asks if anyone in the crowd was ripped off by TK Jewelers and L&L Limos, Robinson quietly adds “and Avani Suits.”

 










The suits are never mentioned again, even as Robinson tells elaborate stories about TK Jewelers selling him an exploding watch and L&L Limos using a black piece of plywood to divide the car in half and sell the back of his limo to a guy with a Super Bowl ring. But one look at the character's unflattering suit tells you everything you need to know: This guy got ripped off by buying a terrible suit at a discount store with a fake Italian name that was an attempt to sound like “Armani” to someone who couldn't tell the difference.

Robinson's alter egos alternate between pledging undying loyalty to these companies and directing hyperbolic rage towards them, but it's all underscored by the same bleak reality: These sad sack characters have so little agency over their own lives that they're completely defined by their consumption. The high points of their years consist of buying more OVD khakis that fit them just right or a bulk order of nice Stanzo fedoras, while their most tragic lows come when they get scammed, disciplined, or just generally ripped off by the large corporations they have little choice but to patronize.

When combined Robinson's primal screams and the writing team's knack for crafting slightly askew sentences that turn into dialogue earworms, the fake company names a potent blend of comedy that feels like it was always destined to define comedy in the 2020s. We've all interacted with a Tecca customer service line or been disappointed in a TK Jewelers watch at some point or another, and Robinson and Kanin's comedy convincingly makes the case that our best bet is to laugh at the absurdity of being alive today. Corporate-speak appears to be getting stupider by the day, so here's hoping they can keep writing new projects fast enough to stay ahead of the madness.

 










“The Chair Company” airs Sundays at 10 p.m. ET on HBO.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","Taylor Swift Earns 15th No. 1 Album With The Life of a Showgirl","https://pitchfork.com/news/taylor-swift-earns-15th-no-1-album-with-the-life-of-a-showgirl/","Mon, 13 Oct 2025 19:11:36 GMT","

As expected, Taylor Swift's new album The Life of a Showgirl has broken records on its way to the No. 1 spot on the Billboard charts. Swift's 15th LP debuted with 4.002 million equivalent album units (including pure album sales and streaming activity), with pure album sales totaling 3,479,500, 1.3 million of which were vinyl sales, Billboard reports via Luminate. The figures best the modern-era record for an overall sales week set by Adele's 25, with 3.482 million units, in 2015.

“I have 4 million thank you's I want to send to the fans, and 4 million reasons to feel even more proud of this album than I already was,” Swift wrote on Instagram celebrating the news. “Thank you for going out to celebrate this project in the movie theaters, investing in vinyl, streaming, watching the video, buying CDs, reading the poems I wrote inside the packaging, and immersing yourselves in The Life of a Showgirl. I'll cherish this feeling forever.”

Swift's eye-watering numbers have broken her out of a tie with Drake and Jay-Z for the most No. 1 albums among soloists, and she is now the only act with the second-most No. 1s since the Billboard 200 began publishing on a weekly basis in 1956 (the Beatles still currently hold the record with 19 No. 1s). Additionally, the top 12 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 this week are occupied by the entirety of The Life of a Showgirl, with “The Fate of Ophelia” claiming the top spot. Swift previously filled the top 10 with Midnights in 2022 and The Tortured Poets Department in 2024.

Swift announced The Life of a Showgirl in August. It features Sabrina Carpenter on the title track, and she worked on the album with Max Martin and Shellback, the Swedish production duo who were behind the boards on 2012's Red, 2014's 1989, and 2017's Reputation. Swift launched the album alongside a limited-time cinema event that topped the box office and, earlier today, announced even more supplementary material: Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The End of an Era, a six-episode docuseries capturing Swift on the Eras Tour, and The Eras Tour | The Final Show, a concert film featuring the tour's final show at Vancouver's BC Place, both premiere on Disney+ in December.

Taylor Swift has completed her The Life of a Showgirl first-week victory lap. Her prize? The top spot on the Billboard 200 albums chart, which marks her 15th Number One album and sets a new record for first-week sales with just over 4 million equivalent album units. Topping off that feat, songs from Swift's The Life of a Showgirl also occupy all Top 12 spots in the Billboard Hot 100 chart.


	On Instagram, the singer reflected on the milestone in a post that looked back on the release of her self-titled debut album released nearly two decades ago. “I'll never forget how excited I was in 2006 when my first album sold 40,000 copies in its first week,” Swift wrote. “I was 16 and couldn't even fathom that that many people would care enough about my music to invest their time and energy into it. Since then I've tried to meet and thank as many people as I could who have given me the chance to chase this insane dream.” 


	She continued: “Here we are all these years later and a hundred times that many people showed up for me this week. I have 4 million thank you's I want to send to the fans, and 4 million reasons to feel even more proud of this album than I already was.”

A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)


The Life of a Showgirl arrived on Oct. 3 and had sold 3.2 million copies in traditional formats, including physical and digital purchases, within just five days. This was thanks, in part, to the CD and vinyl variants she released leading up to the albums release. Most were only available for 24 hours and contained exclusive acoustic versions, demos, and voice messages that fueled fan fervor. 

	











	There were CD variant versions titled “Sweat and Vanilla Perfume,” “It's Frightening,” “It's Rapturous,” and “It's Beautiful,” plus vinyl variant versions titled “The Shiny Bug,” “Baby, That's Show Business,” “Tiny Bubbles in Champagne,” and “The Crowd Is Your King.” Then came four more CD releases titled the “Alone in My Tower Acoustic Version,” “Dressing Room Rehearsal Version,” “The Life Is a Song Acoustic Version,” and “So Glamorous Cabaret Version.” The “Dressing Room Rehearsal Version” and “Alone in My Tower Acoustic Version” came in deluxe formats, too.

	Fans celebrated the release at movie theater screenings of The Official Release Party of a Showgirl, which premiered the “The Fate of Ophelia” music video, lyric videos for the rest of the album, and exclusive commentary on each track from Swift. 


	“Thank you for going out to celebrate this project in the movie theaters, investing in vinyl, streaming, watching the video, buying CDs, reading the poems I wrote inside the packaging, and immersing yourselves in The Life of a Showgirl,” Swift said. “I'll cherish this feeling forever.

Glen Powell escapes death again, again, and again in the latest trailer for The Running Man, Edgar Wright's upcoming adaptation of the 1982 Stephen King novel of the same name. 


	The dystopian action flick stars Powell as Ben Richards, a family man who decides the only way he can get the money necessary to help his sick daughter is to enter a popular television contest with a simple concept: Survive 30 days of professional assassins trying to kill you, and win a boatload of cash. The new trailer opens with a shot of Ben filmed almost like a reality TV show talking head interview, with the character pondering: “You know, I've been thinking about the show: For the next 30 days, everyone in the country is trying to murder me. That's crazy, right?”


	The trailer goes on to tease some of the wild action set pieces Wright has concocted for the film, as well as Ben's steady realization that this already demented game is likely rigged. He links up with some ostensible underground figures, too, including one played by William H. Macy, who outfits Ben with a fake identity (but declines to sell him some C4), and another played by Michael Cera, who tells Ben: “You know why they cheered for you down there? If you can survive against those goons, so can they.”

	Along with Powell, Macy, and Cera, The Running Man's stacked cast features Colman Domingo as the bombastic host of the TV show and Josh Brolin as its conniving producer. The film, which arrives Nov. 14, also stars Lee Pace, Jayme Lawson, Emilia Jones, Katy O'Brian, and Martin Herlihy. 

	











	This marks the second time that The Running Man has been turned into a movie. Back in 1987, Paul Michael Glaser directed an adaptation that starred Arnold Schwarzenegger, Yaphet Kotto, Richard Dawson, María Conchita Alonso, Jim Brown, Jesse Ventura, and more. (Mick Fleetwood and Dweezil Zappa even had small parts in the flick.)

Sammy Hagar has spent the past week gearing up to celebrate his 78th birthday with a bunch of shows at his Cabo Wabo resort in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. He's been joined by guests galore over the course of the shows, including a surprise appearance from Belinda Carlisle, who popped by Saturday night's gig, Oct. 11, to perform two of her biggest songs.


	First, Carlisle bounded onstage to join Hagar for a lively rendition of the Go-Go's 1980 classic, “We Got the Beat.” Carlisle then delivered her 1987 solo hit, “Heaven Is a Place on Earth,” with guitarist Steve Salas and the rest of Hagar's backing band lending the shimmering power-pop gem a crunchier, hard rock edge. 


	Along with Carlisle, Hagar's ongoing birthday bash has featured appearances from guests like Anthrax vocalist Joey Belladonna, Van Halen bassist Michael Anthony, and Bon Jovi guitarist Phil X. Jerry Cantrell has also been a recurring guest, playing guitar on various tracks, including several Alice in Chains classics like “Rooster,” “Would?”, and “Man in the Box.”

	When life gives you lemons … sometimes you end up at a lemonade stand watching a sock puppet show. On Monday, Louis Tomlinson dropped the trippy video for his new single “Lemonade,” which sees him losing it a bit under the scorching sun.


	“She got me wakin' at times that I've never seen/Bright yellow spaceship might make me start to believe,” Tomlinson sings on the track. “Symptoms are stuck on repeat, no point in tryin' to leave/She got me wakin', it's doin' somethin' to me.”


	The video follows Tomlinson sweating through a photo shoot before deciding he's had enough of the heat. In a haze, he stumbles into a surreal estate and finds himself surrounded by lemon-yellow, otherworldly figures who guide him to a bizarre sock-puppet show. Eventually, he snaps out of the trance and dives fully clothed into a pool, finding clarity and escaping the craziness.


	“The most important thing was for the first single to sound ambitious sonically. It had to be big and fun,” he previously said of the single. “To me, ‘Lemonade' really has instant and natural personality. It ended up being the perfect way to begin this chapter.”

	Earlier this month, Tomlinson announced his 2026 How Did We Get Here? World Tour in celebration of his upcoming album How Did I Get Here?. The arena tour features stops at Madison Square Garden in New York, Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, and the Moody Center in Austin.

	











	 “I sum up it as ‘The record I always deserved to make,'” Tomlinson said in a statement while announcing his album. “My bread and butter is my honesty. I genuinely wear my heart on my sleeve, and I hope it comes through in the music.… For the first time now, I'm allowing myself to be the artist I'd always hoped to be.”

The footage authorities tried to hide is now being shown for the first time in the trailer for Paranormal Investigations.

Produced under the title Hennesy House Murders, the found footage horror comedy was shot on location at the historic Dunnington Mansion in Farmville, Virginia.

It follows the cast and crew of a paranormal reality show as they enter the infamous Hennesy House. What begins as a familiar ghost hunt spirals out of control into a night of blood, terror, and sharp-edged satire.

Jamie Bernadette (I Spit on Your Grave: Deja Vu) stars with David J. Rivera, Logan Stem, Tatiana Robledo, Nick Oprea, John Witt, and Terry Schappert.

Raymond Wallace writes, directs, and produces for Rayolight Productions.

“It's not just about scaring people,” said Wallace. “We wanted to capture the absurdity of reality television colliding with genuine horror. The result is something darkly humorous, where you might laugh because you're nervous, and then realize the joke has teeth.”

Paranormal Investigations is coming soon. Stay tuned for release details.

Well, folks, spooky season is here again, and as we gear up for Halloween, there's absolutely no better time of year to binge through Supernatural. But since you're unlikely to get through all 15 seasons (and 327 episodes) before October 31st, here are some of the most timely Winchester power-hours for you to sink your teeth into this fall.

For bonus points, you could also watch Season 8's ""Blood Brother,"" which was the only episode to actually air on Halloween (October 31, 2012). But, since the episode itself isn't too Halloween-y, we've left it off this list. So, without further ado, hop into your Impala and rev up the engine, because these are the Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles) adventures you can't miss this season.

For every Supernatural episode set in the fall or around Halloweentime, only one of them actually features the Winchesters carving pumpkins. Season 15's ""Last Holiday"" is already a great episode of Supernatural, introducing the wood nymph Mrs. Butters (Meagen Fay), who becomes a quick den mother to the Winchesters and Jack (Alexander Calvert).

Realizing the boys have never properly celebrated any holiday, they decide to make up for lost time, celebrating not just Halloween, but also Thanksgiving and Christmas. If you're already in a festive mood, ""Last Holiday"" is the perfect Supernatural episode if you want to still enjoy Halloween while simultaneously looking forward to the rest of the holiday season.

The earliest seasons of Supernatural always did horror the best, and Season 2's ""Playthings"" is the perfect example of these types of spooky TV horror stories. As the brothers travel to small-town Connecticut, they encounter an eclectic inn that may just be haunted by a vengeful spirit, one who takes the form of a young girl's imaginary friend, Maggie (Conchita Campbell).

But why is this episode perfect for Halloween? Considering all the scary movies flooding television channels that follow a similar premise, there's no reason why ""Playthings"" shouldn't cycle into rotation this fall. After all, the cozy factor of the New England inn mixed with the horrors of evil spirits just screams October, even if this episode aired in January.

Speaking of episodes that feel ripped straight out of a horror flick, Season 1's ""Hook Man"" introduces one of the show's most memorable one-and-done villains. As the Hook Man (Sean Millington) terrorizes a young woman, Lori (Jane McGregor), and all those around her, Sam and Dean are thrown into the fray as they try their darndest to keep the ghostly slasher from killing anyone else it deems ""impure."" It's intense in all the best ways.

If slashers are more your style during Halloweentime, then don't sleep on this chilling Supernatural hour. Not only is the Hook Man a frightening antagonist, but the episode ventures into issues of faith as Sam and Lori struggle with the events occurring around them. This is another episode made to be revisited at this time of year.

Of course, straight-up horror isn't the only thing on TV this time of year. If reality TV ""paranormal investigation"" shows are more your speed, then ""Ghostfacers"" will be your favorite Supernatural episode this fall. As the Winchesters once again encounter Ed Zeddmore (A.J. Buckley) and Harry Spangler (Travis Wester), this whole episode is framed as if it's an actual reality series, complete with night vision and censorship bleeps.

""Ghostfacers"" is hilarious. It's one of those episodes that's great to revisit any time of the year, but it feels especially relevant at Halloween if you're thinking about checking out that local farmhouse that's been the talk of town legend for decades. Though it's a bit more intense than your usual reality show, it's a sobering reminder that there are some things you just shouldn't mess with.

Another killer episode from Supernatural's first season, ""Scarecrow"" is perfect Halloween-centric nightmare fuel, especially if your hometown hosted an annual ""Scarecrow Festival"" every October when you were growing up (okay, maybe that's just me). As Sam and Dean split up for the first time, Dean is left all on his own to deal with a possessed scarecrow as it attacks anyone who enters this small Indiana town.

While it perhaps comes up a bit short on treats, ""Scarecrow"" is full of tricks as the Winchesters come face-to-face with one of their most frightening monster-of-the-week cases ever. If you saw this hauntingly sinister scarecrow sitting in someone's yard on Halloween, you probably wouldn't dare go near it either.

As we established with ""Last Holiday,"" not every Halloween-themed episode has to be scary, nor does it have to explicitly be about the annual October festivities. Season 5's ""The Real Ghostbusters"" is a great example of an episode that covers many of the things folks love about Halloween — dressing up as monsters, haunted houses, horror, etc. — without actually addressing the holiday itself. Even better, the whole thing takes place at a Supernatural convention.

While strangely not the most meta episode of the fifth season (don't forget about ""Changing Channels""), ""The Real Ghostbusters"" is a fun look at fan culture, specifically horror fans in this case, as the Winchesters and Chuck Shurley (Rob Benedict) encounter a horde of ""Supernatural"" fans who love the in-universe novels about their life. Talk about a treat.

Not only is the Supernatural ""Pilot"" just a great episode on its own, but many forget that when we first meet grown-up Sam and his friends at Stanford, they're celebrating Halloween. It's a quick detail that the show wastes no time passing over (especially since Sam doesn't dress up himself), but it frames the tone and feel of the entire series. It's no wonder so many episodes from the first season have made their way onto this list. Supernatural literally begins on Halloween!

As for the case in question, Sam and Dean reunite after a few years to search for their father, John Winchester (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), but are soon distracted by a Woman in White who their father had been previously investigating. It's long been said that every episode of Supernatural's early years felt like a 45-minute horror movie, and all of that starts here. Don't skip out on the first episode as you dive into these Winchester specials.

What is Halloween without kids, though, right? After all, trick or treating is really all about helping your little ones get candy while dressing up as monsters, princesses, or superheroes. Well, while Season 3's ""The Kids Are Alright"" doesn't take place during the holiday itself, it does introduce a child into Dean's life in the form of Ben Braeden (Nicholas Elia), who many still believe is his illegitimate son. As kids in suburbia begin to act strangely, feeding on their parents, this episode is spookier than most.

But these kids aren't just feeding on their parents because there wasn't enough holiday candy, it's because they've been swapped out with changelings. Talk about a parent's worst nightmare. As Sam and Dean take down the monsters in question, ""The Kids Are Alright"" reminds us to be grateful that literal monster children aren't creeping at our doorstep on Halloween night.

Around this time of year is when local urban legends begin to spread, and there are few urban legends that Supernatural brought to life better than that of Bloody Mary. The final Season 1 episode on our list, ""Bloody Mary"" takes the Winchesters to Ohio to investigate the ghostly phenomenon as folks keep dropping dead with their eyes missing after staring in a mirror. Secrets, lies, and evil spirits are at the heart of this episode, a bad combination any time of year, but especially on Halloween.

Sam is very much at the center of this episode, as he's still wrestling with a secret he's kept about Jessica's (Adrianne Palicki) death after the ""Pilot."" It's this secret that allows him to draw Bloody Mary (Jovanna Huguet) to him, only made possible by that fateful Halloween weekend. Though not set on October 31st, it may as well have been.

For kids, Scooby-Doo is very much at the center of many Halloween traditions. Whether you love to revisit Scooby-Doo! And the Witch's Ghost or Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island this time of year or prefer the original Scooby-Doo, Where Are You? cartoons, ""Scoobynatural"" will give you the best of both worlds — with Sam, Dean, and Castiel (Misha Collins) to boot. After the trio are sucked into the world of the ""A Night of Fright Is No Delight"" episode, cartoon antics ensue.

With iconic Scooby performers Frank Welker, Matthew Lillard, Grey DeLisle, and Kate Micucci reprising their roles from various films and television productions, ""Scoobynatural"" is the crossover Supernatural fans never knew they needed. Scooby-Doo and Halloween have long gone hand-in-hand, so this episode is a no-brainer. Plus, it's just always a fun watch.

Conspiracy theorists are once again accusing NFL officials of aiding the Chiefs after Kansas City went unpenalized in Sunday's win over the Detroit Lions. 

The latest controversies were highlighted by a questionable third-quarter catch by Travis Kelce.

Although the ruling on the field was a reception, the ball appeared to rattle around as he fell to the field. In the end, Kelce seemed to trap the ball underneath his body, not that the on-field officials appeared to notice.

Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes wisely went no huddle on the next play to deny replay officials and Lions coach Dan Campbell the chance to review the catch, which was good enough for 13 yards and helped to set up a nine-yard touchdown pass to Hollywood Brown.

Fans, including the 'Rate the Refs' X account, clearly disagreed with the ruling.

'This catch by Travis Kelce should have been ruled an incomplete catch with how it hits the ground,' Rate the Refs wrote on X. 'Chiefs hurry and snap the ball before it can be reviewed.'

'Well it's the chiefs and a prime time game, so officials dare not make the correct call,' wrote on conspiratorial critic on X.

But not everyone agreed with that assessment. Namely, NBC rules analyst Terry McAulay said it was, indeed, a catch.

'I believe it would have,' the former NFL official said on the broadcast. 'It looks like he does get control prior to the ball touching the ground. And then he never loses it.'

That wasn't the only disputed call of the game, though.

Kelce appeared to get away with a holding penalty on a fourth-quarter screen pass to Brashard Smith in the fourth quarter. 

Mahomes found Brown for another touchdown a few plays later.

Despite this looking really cool, Terry McAulay explains why Jared Goff was lined up illegally and why this touchdown was taken off the board. pic.twitter.com/fXZ2I5xBFT

Refs also took a Lions touchdown off the board in the first quarter due to an illegal motion call against Detroit quarterback Jared Goff.

Goff began the goal-line play under center before motioning left behind receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown near the pylon.

With Goff split wide, running back David Montgomery received the direct shotgun snap before throwing back to his quarterback, who managed to fight his way into the end zone with a helpful block from St. Brown. 

At first, it looked like a clear touchdown and an early 6-0 lead at Arrowhead Stadium.

Unfortunately for Goff, he committed a penalty on the play by failing to first establishing himself in the backfield before motion out wide.

'This an illegal formation,' McAulay said.

Then, exacerbating the Lions' situation, Goff was flagged for delay of game while arguing the non-reviewable call with officials on the field. As a result, Detroit would have to settle for a field goal and an early 3-0 edge. 

What officials may have missed on the play was Chiefs defensive tackle Chris Jones lining up in the neutral zone.

'Is this a Chiefs gimme?' asked one Lions fan. 'Just like every chief game.'

Then there was a roughing-the-passer call against the Lions' Aiden Hutchinson, which led some Chiefs haters to accuse Mahomes of flopping on the play.

'Clear flop,' one fan wrote online.

Many other, though, called it a 'clear roughing the passer' penalty.

NFL fans have long suspected the Chiefs are benefitting from friendly officiating in an attempt to boost league television ratings. Those suspicions only grew in 2023 when Kelce began dating Taylor Swift, who helped to popularize the league among her army of fans. 

Statistics don't necessarily back up these claims of poor officiating, but on Sunday in Kansas City, the Chiefs did avoid a single penalty flag as they improved to 3-3 for the season.

'No penalties called on the Chiefs tonight,' one fan remarked on X. 'Lmao ok.'

'KC with zero penalties is hilarious,' a Lions fan added. 'NFL isn't even hiding it...false starts, holding and blocks in the back all-over.'

As another fan put it: 'When they overturned the first td we all knew what was going to happen.' 

The Chiefs committed 13 penalties in a loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars a week earlier. And as Kelce told ESPN after the win, that remained a theme for Kansas City throughout the week.  

'Penalties and turnovers are going to ruin you in this league,' Kelce said. 'It was a bit embarrassing seeing how many flags we had last week. It was a huge focal point this week.'","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","other"

Top publicly traded Ethereum treasury firm BitMine Immersion Technologies bought the crypto dip.

The Las Vegas-based firm added 202,037 ETH—about $838 million worth at the current price—bringing its total holdings to 3,032,188 ETH, valued at more than $12.5 billion. It also holds around $220 million worth of BTC and maintains around $239 million in assets between its ”moonshots” investments and cash. 

“The crypto liquidation over the past few days created a price decline in ETH, which BitMine took advantage of. We acquired 202,037 ETH tokens over the past few days pushing our ETH holdings to over 3 million, or 2.5% of the supply of ETH,” said BitMine Chairman Tom Lee in a statement.

BitMine's stash makes it the largest publicly traded Ethereum treasury company and the second-largest crypto treasury overall—only trailing Bitcoin behemoth, Strategy, which holds more than $73 billion worth of Bitcoin. 

The firm's latest purchase pushes it more than half way to its goal of accumulating 5% of the entire Ethereum token supply with more than 3 million ETH accumulated at an average price of $4,154. That's just below the current price of about $4,163.

ETH fell as low as $3,686 on Friday amid a record $19 billion in crypto liquidations after President Trump threatened severe new trade tariffs on China. It has since jumped back up, gaining more than 9% in the last 24 hours as Trump has softened his tone on a trade war.

“Volatility creates deleveraging and this can cause assets to trade at substantial discounts to fundamentals, or as we say, 'substantial discount to the future,' and this creates advantages for investors, at the expense of traders,"" said Lee.

Myriad users are bullish on Ethereum avoiding another big drop Monday, currently predicting a nearly 94% likelihood that ETH remains above a price of $3,800 by the end of the day. (Disclaimer: Myriad is a product of Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN.)

Other treasury firms, like Bitcoin miner MARA Holdings joined BitMine in buying the dip, adding $46 million in BTC during the market's brief tumble. 

Shares in BitMine (BMNR) have opened around 4.35% higher on Monday, trading at $54.75. It was trading above $60 prior to Friday's market sell-off and is now down around 9.35% in the last five trading days.

White House planners have been increasingly focused on securing airspace over stadiums.

The Trump administration is moving to fortify U.S. skies against potential drone threats ahead of next summer's World Cup and other marquee mega-events, casting the technology as necessary both to bolster security and to help outpace foreign competition for aviation technology.

The administration plans to launch a $500 million effort to support state and local governments as they develop anti-drone security strategies ahead of the soccer tournament being played across the U.S., Canada and Mexico, along with the United States' 250th anniversary and 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, according to Andrew Giuliani, director of the White House's FIFA World Cup 2026 Task Force.

The White House says the money will be available to all 50 states but put to particular use to secure the 104 soccer matches that will be played in American stadiums. Officials envision urban police departments using handheld tools to detect aircraft, then either disabling them via jamming technology or ordering them to return to their points of origin.

“Everybody from the governors to different commissioners of the police in these different cities to the stadium chief security officer say that this is something that they need in order to protect the [World Cup] sites,” Giuliani told POLITICO in an interview.

The program, which comes out of funds budgeted to the Department of Homeland Security by the One Big Beautiful Bill enacted in July, reflects growing concern within the White House and national security agencies about uncrewed aerial threats, especially at major events — from well-organized terrorists, criminal mischief-makers or just overeager amateurs unaware that the airspace has been closed.

The funding will further insert the White House into a controversial debate over which law enforcement officials should be able to intercept or disable drones. Currently only federal agencies can do so, and a House bill that would extend that capacity to local police appears stalled. The administration is exploring contingency plans that would allow the Justice Department to temporarily authorize state and local officials to take down rogue drones in the event that Congress fails to act.

“Drones are a disruptive technology. They have an amazing potential for both good and ill,” Seb Gorka, the National Security Council's senior director for counterterrorism, has said. “We will increase the enforcement of current laws to deter two types of individuals: evildoers and idiots — the clueless and the careless.”

In August, Gorka joined Giuliani to meet with representatives of the local-organizing committees in the 11 American cities that will host World Cup matches. Drones have become “a key part” of planning by the White House task force, said Giuliani. The leading security officer for FIFA, soccer's international governing body, has identified drones as the greatest security challenge for the 39-day tournament.

“Let's use the World Cup as the urgency, right?” said Giuliani, whose task force was formed in coordination with the National Security Council, DHS and Department of Justice and now meets daily to align federal and local security efforts. “In nine months, World Cup games are going to kick off, and there's no pushing that back. So let's get the equipment we need to make sure that it's as safe as possible.”

World Cup host cities already have access to a $625 million grant program, created by the One Beautiful Bill Act and now administered by DHS, to reimburse security costs related to tournament preparations. States and territories will soon receive guidance on how to apply for drone-security funds.

“There will be a certain minimal amount that's available for every state, whether or not they host World Cup games or America 250 events,” Giuliani said.

The U.S., Canada and Mexico held the first trilateral meeting on counter-drone coordination this summer in Mexico City despite differing legal frameworks across the three World Cup co-hosts.

“We're going to put our best practices forward and urge our co-hosts to come to the table with their best practices as well,” he said, “and see what ultimately are best practices for all three of the countries to move forward there.” 

Still, gaps in U.S. law remain a key obstacle. Under current federal rules, only the Justice and Homeland Security Departments have the authority to take down or intercept unmanned aircraft in unauthorized locations or otherwise considered a threat.

“DHS, FBI, the FAA, and the state, local, tribal and territorial law enforcement partners who will partner with them during the FIFA World Cup matches must be equipped with the resources and legal frameworks necessary to mitigate drone threats across all venues where airspace security risks are identified,” FIFA Chief Safety and Security Officer G.B. Jones told a House Homeland Security Committee hearing last month. “This includes matches, FIFA fan training sites and other large outdoor gatherings where drone threats may compromise safety and security.”

That concern has prompted competing efforts in state capitals and on Capitol Hill to clarify lines of responsibility between governmental authorities. In September, more than 30 governors urged Congress to pass legislation granting states the same drone mitigation powers as federal agencies. The House Transportation Committee has approved a bill that includes a pilot program that would do so at certain events, but it is unclear when that will head to the House floor.

Beyond the World Cup, the administration is tying drone policy to broader industrial and defense goals. In June, Trump signed executive orders to enhance airspace security, accelerate domestic drone innovation and expand commercial operations.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who has described drones as part of a “weapons-technology revolution,” has warned that they “are being used to smuggle deadly drugs, target our infrastructure and spy on U.S. defenses.”

Cape Verde have become the second smallest nation to qualify for the FIFA World Cup after beating Eswatini 3-0 to book their place at next year's tournament.

The island nation knew that victory would secure their World Cup spot heading into the match.

Goals from Dailon Livramento and Willy Semedo either side of half-time saw the team close on the historic accomplishment.

A third goal from defender Stopira in second half stoppage time sealed the 3-0 victory to start celebrations at their national stadium.

With a population 524,877 according to the World Bank, Cape Verde is roughly the same size as Sheffield.

Iceland qualified for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, with the nation having an estimated population of around 335,000 at the time.

The nation had been part of Portugal until it declared independence back in 1975.

Cape Verde had not been a member of FIFA until 1982 and first attempted to qualify for the World Cup back in 2002.  

The national team, known as the Blue Sharks, had seen six unsuccessful attempts but will now feature in next summer's finals in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

The team, coached by Bubista, have qualified after finishing top of their group with seven wins, two draws and one defeat.

Cape Verde had spurned a chance to seal qualification last week after drawing 3-3 against Libya, but got over the line with victory on Monday.

The result saw them finish four points clear of Cameroon, who have the record for most appearances at the World Cup by an African nation with eight.

Cape Verde had shown improvement in recent years by qualifying for the African Cup of Nations on four occasions.

The national team reached the quarter-finals on debut in 2013 and repeated the feat a decade later in the Ivory Coast.

Despite reaching the World Cup, they failed to qualify for the upcoming African Cup of Nations later this year.

Cape Verde have benefited from FIFA's expansion of the tournament to 48 teams, up from 32.

The expansion ensured nine direct qualification spots for African nations, marking an increase from five previously.

Cape Verde are the third nation assured of making their World Cup debuts next year, with Uzbekistan and Jordan also qualifying for the first time. 

Cameroon now face a wait to see whether they will participate in Africa's World Cup play-offs.

The Indomitable Lions, whose squad includes stars such as André Onana, Carlos Baleba and Bryan Mbeumo, need to be one of the four best runners-up across the group stage.

They would then need to win two knock-out matches to advance to an additional intercontinental qualifier in March. ","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","soccer"

Dave Kalema has a great story to tell — several, in fact. You can read all about his big break 31 years in the making here, but for the rest of it we're publishing his cinematic journey in full. He calls it “The Dreamscape.” 

“When I learned of the news that this story would be published in IndieWire, I was emotional,” he said. “There's something about having ‘Dreamscape' published that allows me to feel like I'm carrying forward a sense of, I call it in a way, I'm a reckless dreamer. I don't deny the dream in me.”

Neither do we. Here's “The Dreamscape.”

When you grow up as the middle child of Fred and Barbara Kalema, the closest you'll ever get to creative expression is a Panasonic camcorder you won't be allowed to touch. It's 1998 and these cameras are flying off the shelves of RadioShack. One day when you're in the first grade, you'll come home from school and see one on your kitchen table. It'll be perched on top of the box it came in like it's been waiting for you. When you sit down you'll be eye level with its Panasonic insignia like it's introducing itself personally. You know it's expensive because dad's footsteps get increasingly louder as he runs down the stairs from his bedroom. “Hey, don't touch that!” In his thick Ugandan accent he yells this before welcoming you home.

You'll nickname it “The Toy” because you're tired of dad saying “this isn't a toy”. Over the next few months you'll see him buy every accessory under the sun. The travel bag. The shoulder strap. Extra VHS-C tapes. After the school year lets out, you'll board a plane to spend your third summer in Uganda. Mom is starting to show because she's due in six months, but it's dad who has The Toy strapped to his body like a newborn.

Everyday he'll get up before 7:00 AM and go to The Site, the plot of land he bought next to his mother's house. The Site's two acres comprise Uganda's trademark red soil and sit on top of Buziga, one of the highest points in Kampala. You'll quickly learn that dad bought The Toy to film the construction of his retirement home there. 21 years after leaving during the Idi Amin regime, dad will finally have the education, career, and means to build a house he can call his own. This new home will prove to his 17 siblings that he successfully cashed in his ticket with Uncle Sam for a better life. With each brick laid at The Site, The Toy will document dad's decades-long dream.

 










At night dad will turn the lens on you. You'll wear your hat backwards, perform impromptu skits with Frederick, your older brother, and make the family laugh. When The Toy is pointed at you, it's like dad is Andy while you and Frederick become Woody and Buzz Lightyear. You'll go to infinity and beyond every night because The Toy will create a safe place for your self-expression to fly. Even when the power goes out like it will most nights, Auntie Beatrice will light up the living room with a kerosene lamp to keep the production rolling. If Uganda had anything like America's Funniest Home Videos, you definitely would have been on it.

When dad falls asleep on the flight back to Washington, D.C., you'll remove The Toy from the bag beneath his feet. You'll stick the camera in passengers' faces with the restless curiosity of a five year old. Why is your baby crying ma'am? It didn't like Uganda? Sir, who is the woman sleeping on your shoulder? Who's your favorite character in Toy Story? You'll press all the buttons you've seen dad press for months because you no longer have to wait for him to play. The Toy is in your hands now. You're free.

A few days after coming home you'll be playing Nintendo 64 in your bedroom. Dad will yell your name at the octave that lets you know you have less than ten seconds to make it down the stairs before he calls again. When you see him holding The Toy in one hand, you'll freeze. “What did I tell you about this?” You won't have the words to downplay your disobedience because the incriminating tunes of black and white static are bellowing out from the TV. In a few seconds you'll learn that your British Airways in-flight masterpiece came at the expense of his ‘98 summer original that he filmed at The Site. In the deafening silence that connects you two, he'll hand out his Toygate verdict: “You're never allowed to touch this again!”

 










It'll be twenty-one years before you put your hands on another camera.

As a first-generation Ugandan-American, your creativity will buckle under the false promises of assimilation. You'll attend two different churches because your parents pray separately. White kids will touch your hair at school. Every other Saturday will be spent at the Luganda Academy your parents start with their friends. After school you'll either be at Kumon lessons with the Desi kids, Tae-Kwon Do classes with the Koreans, or soccer practice playing on your neighbor's team. Every summer, you'll be the American cousin in Uganda because of your accent. Each room in this revolving door of cultural immersion will be its own sisyphean struggle for belonging. Only when you start playing basketball will you feel free from the pressures of having to fit in.

Every once in a while you'll scratch a creative itch. You'll color your 7th grade science reports until Mrs. Baxter tells the entire class she's not a fan of your work. You'll take music recording, ceramics, painting, and improv in high school. In college you'll play basketball for one of the greatest coaches of all time. He's a future Naismith Basketball Hall of Famer who you'll win a National Championship with. Still, you'll attend the improv shows and spoken word open mics wishing you could borrow a modicum of confidence from the kid who hijacked The Toy at 30,000 feet.

 










Then mom will blindside you: she is taking a job with the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland. Even though the contract is only for a year, she's betting on herself to get an extension because this is her dream job. She's giving up the home she made in one country for the chance to reach the pinnacle of her career in another. She'll double down on the fact that this UN job will allow you to finish school without shouldering more student loan debt. Her leap of faith will inspire you, but not enough to follow her. You'll graduate Cum Laude to honor her sacrifice, then move to Atlanta on your own to start your career.

It'll happen within the first ten days of your move. You'll be walking home from work when a streetlight will spark the idea. You'll run to CVS, buy the cheapest notebook you find, and sprint home before your vision evaporates over dinner plans. Two hours will feel like two minutes because words will come faster than you can write them. When you uber to Java Monkey in Decatur, Georgia a few nights later and sign up for the open mic, you'll be called sixth and perform that original spoken word poem about a retired Black athlete who misses playing under the lights.

In a few days, mom will answer your phone call unaware that you're still high from the standing ovation you got. You'll be nervous because you saved the encore for her. She's listening intently to your words, but her silence lasts too long. When you see the Whatsapp connection isn't lagging, you'll sober up and your voice will freeze instead. You've never known mom to be apathetic, so that chasm of silence will feel larger than the ocean separating you two.

 










You won't perform again after that. You'll go to work, play hoops at the rec, and continue writing at night. In a year you'll move to New York City for a new job that will promote you early, fly you all over the world, and pay you enough to afford your own apartment by the time you're 24. It's the type of job immigrant parents call home about. The kind that will turn you into a living trophy to display on their mantle of expectations. That's why nobody will believe you when you tell them you're quitting after just three years. They won't understand that you'll never truly care about that company or its perks. They'll fail to see that you're no longer willing to pay the price of being the only Black person in that room. That job will only ever be a trojan horse to disguise the idea that started to flow from your pen night after night.

––––

People will use “blog”, “podcast”, and “side hustle” to describe what you're doing even though you'll never utter those words yourself. Dad will tell his friends you've transitioned to IT because he knows you're using computers. Your aunties will say you never should have quit your job. Former colleagues will use predictably boring Silicon Valley jargon to question what you're building. The reality is you're making The Players Tribune for athletes that don't go pro. You're writing about life after sports in your mid-twenties and your media company will enjoy a tiny amount of success for someone with no media experience.

 










Your campus ambassador program will launch at 12 schools across the country. You'll reach 15,000 readers a month. Former athletes working at companies like Qualcomm, Spotify, Google, and The New York Times will submit their own stories. Then one day, Sarah, the Vice President of a sports media brand will tell you she's unfortunately too busy to pen her story for you. Without hesitation, you'll shoot your shot: Sarah, can I film your story instead? When you walk into the Best Buy at Union Square the next day to buy a Canon Rebel T6, you'll hold that box as if you're five years old and never heard dad's footsteps coming down the stairs.

You'll get so high from filming Sarah, that you'll run and gun five more interviews in three weeks. The extent of your new video department is you, the T6, your iPhone, and a Tascom lavalier mic B&H oversold you because you'll clearly know nothing about film equipment. When Sarah texts you to ask when her video is coming out, you'll frantically message Meghan who you went to college with. Can you teach me how to edit videos? Lucky for you, she lives a few minutes from your Brooklyn apartment and is happy to start teaching you Premiere.

If shooting these videos unlocks a creative door, editing them will give you keys to the building. With that power you'll aim higher. I'm going to be in Miami next week. Video interview? When Shane Battier accepts your ten word hail mary, you'll be too naive to know that his 30 minute window isn't enough time to do a shoot in an NBA arena. That's all I need! That night you'll buy the cheapest flight to South Beach and ask Joyzel, who you also went to college with, if she can bring her fancy Sony cameras. You successfully booked a 2x NBA Champion and want your video department to be more professional than Best Buy's Geek Squad made you believe you were. Lucky for you, Joyzel is from Miami and will be happy to direct your shoot in her hometown.

 










I can talk about the preparation you did the night before. I could rehash the similarities between that production and the adrenaline that marked your college basketball games. I'll just tell you what happens after Miami. You'll fly back to New York, assemble a rough cut, and send it to Joyzel for feedback. Unfortunately, you'll only hear crickets from her and self-doubt from yourself. When she finally emerges after three weeks, she'll simply email you an updated version of your video. You'll keep restarting it because her color grade, sound design, and graphics will put you in a trance. You've never made images move like that. After your fifth watch, you'll start feeling something in your chest.

That sensation will be so overwhelming, you'll have no choice but to take a walk. Two hours will go by like 30 seconds because your feet won't stop moving toward whatever direction epiphanies lead. You'll be standing on the corner of 6th Ave and W Houston St when that burning in your chest will give way to a vision. After that day, all you'll want to do is feel that again and the only way you know how is to recapture the magic of Miami.

Unfortunately, COVID won't care about your epiphany.

––––

In March of 2020, your fire to make videos will be extinguished by the pandemic's uncertainty. You'll binge watch all the Harry Potter movies on HBO Max. Quibi will come and go from your life quicker than Steph Curry's jump shot. You'll consume every Shantell Martin video on YouTube wondering if you'll ever be as bold as the lines she draws. Instead of making videos, you'll be glued to screens like babies who are given iPads by their parents to keep them quiet.

 










Your restlessness will meet its match on Sunday, April 19th when you sit down to watch the first two episodes of The Last Dance. Two hours will go by like ten seconds because those images will make sense in ways they couldn't have before Miami. You've interviewed professional athletes, used two camera setups, and incorporated graphics into an edit. So when Eric B. and Rakim's “I Ain't No Joke” scores the montage of Michael Jordan's rookie season, you'll visualize that edit on a timeline in your head. Two jump cuts for MJ's And-1. The fading crowd audio under Magic Johnson's speechless. Obama's admiration. The no look pass. MJ's gold chains at All-Star weekend. His cradle. And those rainbow lens flares following MJ through the tunnel in Paris!? It's poetry in motion. Of course the feeling in your chest will return.

Over the next few weeks, you'll listen to Jason Hehir, the director of The Last Dance, on every podcast like a fiend who needs another hit of his story. When you hear him say where he went to college, that feeling in your chest will explode. You also went to a small liberal arts school in Western Massachusetts. You too were a college athlete. The school he attended just so happens to be the rival school you beat ten out of thirteen times on the court. How the hell did he transition to making films at the highest level?

 










In the silence of your Brooklyn apartment, you'll say four words that you are certain match that feeling in your chest. I can do that. You won't have a clue how to make films at the level of The Last Dance and you won't know anyone who does. You won't even be sure if COVID will give you a real shot to figure it out. Without a shadow of a doubt, what you will know then, is that you spent your whole life climbing a mountain just to see the clarity of your own dream.

I'm going to make movies.

––––

I wish I could tell you that everything falls into place after this, but almost half a decade will go by. You'll move 13 times in that span, bouncing from cheap month-to-month sublets to make your money stretch before it houdinis. You'll even give up on New York twice. Since breaking into film is tougher than the Bad Boy Pistons, you'll surf a creative wave back to the stage for the first time in seven years. Telling stories will tide you over because it will be the first time that you'll ever reveal the pervasive feeling of otherness that accompanied your Ugandan-American upbringing. You'll watch movies and attend every filmmaking workshop during the day, but you'll chase the highs of the stage at night.

In just a few years your storytelling will be featured on NPR and you'll never lose any of The Moth's GrandSlam storytelling competitions you compete in. When you return from your first road show, you'll get a text. “Hey Dave, I think you should apply to this”. It'll come from Francesca who just earned her first Editor credit on Netflix's Stamped From the Beginning. As soon as you look at the website for Industry Standard's nine month post-production residency, you'll see that it's supported by Netflix and know you're a longshot. Since your odds will feel as slim as Kevin Durant, you'll just practice what you've been doing on stage: telling a story only you can tell.

 










On the morning of Friday August 16th, 2024 you'll finish your weekly 10-mile bike ride and come back to the apartment you have a day to move out of. It's been 89 days since you submitted your application. You just sold all your camera gear to fund tomorrow's move. You don't know where you'll be going. That's when the email will finally arrive. When you lock eyes with that notification on your phone, your heart will race faster than it does when you're cycling. Your hands will shake to the point where you'll forget to breathe because your fate will hang precariously in the balance of what that email says.

When you finally calm down enough to open it, you won't even get through the first line before dropping to your knees. On the floor of that apartment, you'll cry tears of relief. You're 31 and have no credits to your name, but Industry Standard will believe in your story enough to offer you one of their five limited spots. Even though you dreamt of making films, you never imagined that your opportunity would come with an Assistant Editor job at Library Films, mentorship from Industry Standard, and support from Netflix. When you pick yourself off the floor, you'll call your younger brother, George, and the words will spill out like air released after a pressure valve bursts.

 










I did it. I'm going to be working on a Netflix project.

––––

The weight of this accomplishment won't hit you until you see everything you own fit in the back of a rented Nissan Rogue. As you drive back to New York, you won't stop thinking about the price of your dream, how simple your life had to become to chase it, and your parents. The look in mom's eyes when she said she was uprooting her life again for the United Nations. The anger in dad's voice when he learned you mishandled The Toy and erased footage of the home he was working toward since 1977. In ways you never could have before, you'll see yourself in both of them––you left home to chase an uncertain path. Maybe mom and dad were never supposed to nurture your creativity just like their parents never drew them a blueprint on how to survive as immigrants. Like you, they had to be the first in their families to figure it out.

So yeah, as the middle child of Fred and Barbara Kalema, it will take you more than three decades to earn a real shot at a creative life. Now that you're finally here, just remember that your dreams were never really yours alone.
