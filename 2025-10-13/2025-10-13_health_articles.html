                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cancer is a challenging enough diagnosis, but many patients are dealt a second blow, even as they heal: "chemo brain." For many, the effects last years beyond cancer treatment. A new study offers new models for studying causes of chemo brain and points to the effects of chemotherapy drugs on the brain's lymphatic system, which is a network of tiny vessels in the brain's protective membranes that help remove waste and transport immune cells. There's compounding evidence now that these meningeal lymphatics are involved in cognitive issues, including Alzheimer's disease and traumatic brain injury, too. Women are affected by chemo brain, or brain fog, much more than men when treated by very common chemotherapies, such as those used on breast cancer patients on a regular basis." Jennifer Munson, co-corresponding author, professor and director of the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC's Cancer Research Center in Roanoke "Our study is important because it explores a very real, hidden layer of chemotherapy treatment that leaves lasting scars on the daily lives of those who are living with or have survived in their cancer journey," said Roberts, a former postdoctoral associate who trained in Munson's lab at the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute and now continues to study the lymphatic system in her own lab. Munson and her team developed a three-tiered modeling system, using a combination of mouse and tissue-engineered models, to study changes to the lymphatic system. The in vitro model is the first human tissue engineered system that replicates this unique tissue, and has the potential for therapeutic testing, patient specific analyses, and disease-specific incorporation. While both showed lymphatic system impacts, they were much more pronounced with docetaxel. "What we see is a shrinking of the lymphatic vessels, and fewer loops or branches in the vessels," said Munson, who is also a professor in Virginia Tech's Department of Biomedical Engineering and Mechanics. "These are signs of reduced growth that indicate the lymphatics are changing, or not regenerating in beneficial ways. Lymphatic health really declined across all three models measured in different ways." As anticipated, brain imaging showed reduced drainage of the lymphatic system in mice. When the research team performed cognitive tests, they found that if a mouse had been treated with docetaxel, it exhibited poor memory. Taken together, Munson said, the results suggest chemo brain could result from poor lymphatic-system drainage in response to chemotherapy. "That could potentially account for some of these memory deficits, which is similar to what we have seen in Alzheimer's disease," Munson said. We know of other things that affect flow in the brain, as well, such as better sleep and exercise." "Lymphatic diseases in general affect women more than men," she said. "Ultimately, this work underscores the need to consider not only survival, but also the long-term, often overlooked neurological side effects of cancer treatment on cognitive well-being and quality of life," Roberts said, "Especially in women who are disproportionately affected by these lasting side effects."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease, N-ERD, is associated with measurable changes in concentrations of lipid mediators involved in inflammation and pain modulation, a new study shows. Plasma concentrations of two key endocannabinoid-related lipids, arachidonoylethanolamide (AEA) and oleoylethanolamide (OEA), were significantly reduced in patients with N-ERD, compared to healthy controls. N-ERD is a chronic syndrome in which nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, provoke asthma attacks and other respiratory symptoms. Patients typically suffer from severe asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and the condition significantly impairs quality of life. Currently, there is no clinical laboratory test for N-ERD, and diagnosis requires a costly and risky aspirin challenge performed in a hospital setting. The disease mechanisms remain poorly understood, and optimal treatment strategies are still lacking. This present study is the first to report changes in endocannabinoid signaling in patients with N-ERD, which may help explain chronic inflammation and heightened perception of pain associated with the condition. In addition to reduced concentrations of AEA and OEA, elevated concentrations of leukotriene E4 and other lipid mediators were also observed, possibly reflecting N-ERD associated inflammation. These changes in lipid metabolism, which affect the endocannabinoid system, may in the future open up new avenues for diagnosing N-ERD, and for developing targeted therapies." The present study included eight individuals diagnosed with N-ERD and seven healthy controls. Salmi, V. E., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Owlstone Medical ("Owlstone"), the global leader in Breath Biopsy¬Æ for applications in early disease detection and precision medicine, today announced that it has won an award of up to $49.1 million from the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) for the Platform Optimizing SynBio for Early Intervention and Detection in Oncology (POSEIDON) program. POSEIDON aims to develop first-in-class synthetic-sensor based Multi-Cancer-Early Detection (MCED) tests for Stage I detection of 30+ solid tumors using only breath and urine samples that can be performed in the home and are available over the counter. Almost 40 % of Americans will develop cancer in their lifetimes and cancer is the second leading cause of death in the U.S. The number of new cancer diagnoses in 2025 is estimated to be more than 2 million, with over 618,000 cancer deaths, equivalent to almost 1,700 deaths every day. Critically, costs associated with late-stage diagnoses are much higher than early-stage, however cancer is difficult to detect early when it is most curable. Drastically reducing late-stage diagnoses by detecting cancer at Stage I would not only increase treatment effectiveness, but also significantly reduce cancer care costs, restoring up to $2.3 trillion to the U.S. economy. While emerging technologies such as liquid biopsy hold great promise for later stage cancer detection and to help guide therapy selection, performance in early-stage cancer detection has been insufficient. Owlstone's project, in partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston University, Georgia Tech Research Corporation, Qurin B.V., and Planned Systems International Inc, aims to overcome this challenge by delivering accurate, low-cost cancer screening for 30+ solid tumors to Americans aged 18 and older. Results will be uploadable real-time to electronic health records (EHR) for rapid review by healthcare professionals, integrating seamlessly into clinical practice and digitally enabled care. This unique approach offers significant advantages over competing technologies. These include boosting the signal to enhance test performance such that cancer is reliably detectable from early stage, enabling simple and non-invasive sample collection at home, rapid result generation and EHR integration, and a low-cost manufacturing model such that economics are not a barrier to adoption of the technology as the new standard of care for early cancer detection. "The field of cancer screening needs a revolution, and POSEIDON stands ready to deliver. The program allows for a better future by creating broadly accessible, at-home tests that will accurately detect 30+ cancers as early as Stage I, when tumors are still small and the chances of survival are high," said POSEIDON Program Manager Ross Uhrich, DMD, MBA. "This revolutionary funding effort brings together experts in synthetic biology, oncology, medical devices, big cancer data, and commercialization to create test kits that will transform how and when people are screened for cancer. POSEIDON will allow every American the opportunity to test themselves long before they have symptoms and at their discretion. Access to an accurate and low-cost MCED test that does not require a doctor's visit or laboratory testing is key to preventing late-stage diagnoses. This award validates both breath as a diagnostic approach and Owlstone's EVOC¬Æ probes as a reporter technology to overcome the shortcomings and challenges that have held back early cancer detection previously.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>INTEGRA Biosciences' SWITCH hybrid pipette has been scientifically evaluated for ergonomics through an in-depth collaboration with the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW). The SWITCH can be operated manually for a familiar handheld pipetting experience, or switched to repeat dispense mode for efficient electronic aliquoting. Pipetting can be one of the most physically demanding tasks in a lab. Daily routines may involve thousands of repetitive thumb and wrist motions, sustained muscle loading and awkward postures, all of which increase the risk of injuries such as tendonitis, carpal tunnel syndrome and shoulder pain. Every aspect has been designed to reduce strain during repetitive tasks, from optimized handle dimensions to a tapered shape that supports neutral wrist alignment, as well as a consistent plunger height that keeps the thumb relaxed across all volumes. The SWITCH also weighs around 130 g, which is well below the grip force capabilities of both men and women, helping to minimize shoulder and arm fatigue during extended use. The SWITCH has been compared to leading manual and electronic models in a series of internal studies, confirming its superior performance for plunger force, handle comfort and task efficiency.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At the moment, there is no test for who might experience sexual problems during treatment for depression, but this discovery may help depressed patients to choose antidepressants which allow them to maintain or regain an active sex life when treated with antidepressants. This work is presented at the ECNP conference in Amsterdam. SSRI antidepressants can help sexual dysfunction by improving mood, but at the same time SSRIs themselves are often associated with sexual side-effects. Unfortunately, there's no way of predicting these side effects in advance. These side effects can affect up to 70% of patients taking SSRI medications, such as Prozac and escitalopram. These effects can be distressing, often leading to people stopping treatment. The Copenhagen-based researchers studied 90 people who had been diagnosed with depression. The patients then started an 8-week course of SSRI antidepressants, with the researchers carefully tracking any sexual side effects that developed. This allowed the researchers to see if they could predict who would have sexual problems based on their pretreatment LDAEP measurement. Lead researcher Dr Kristian Jensen (from Copenhagen University Hospital) said: "We discovered that people with higher serotonin activity before treatment started were much more likely to develop sexual side effects by the end of the 8-week antidepressant course, especially difficulty reaching orgasm. Using this non-invasive brain measure combined with information about sexual problems related to their depression, we could predict the ability to reach orgasm with 87% accuracy. We need a bigger study, with more men, to get an accurate figure for erectile dysfunction". "Currently, patients only discover sexual side effects after they've already started antidepressant medication. However, we are now looking to refine this, we have a 600-patient study underway which will look at how serotonin levels combined with sex hormones levels affect sexual function during depression and medication". When replicated, this type of test might reliably help to know beforehand whether a patient will have sexual adverse effects or not. As many patients experience sexual dysfunction after the start of SSRI antidepressants (like escitalopram), the most important clinical application will be to predict that sexual dysfunction will not occur, especially in patients who worry about that adverse effect and are hesitant to initiate treatment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Global mortality rates are falling but not among youths and young adults, according to the latest Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study published in The Lancet today and presented at the World Health Summit in Berlin. Additionally, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) now account for nearly two-thirds of the world's total mortality and morbidity, with ischemic heart disease, stroke, and diabetes leading the globe. Researchers also estimate that nearly half of all death and disability could be prevented by modifying some of the leading risk factors, such as reducing high levels of blood sugar and high body mass index (BMI). "The rapid growth in the world's aging population and evolving risk factors have ushered in a new era of global health challenges," said Dr. Christopher Murray, Director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington School of Medicine. "The evidence presented in the Global Burden of Disease study is a wake-up call, urging government and health care leaders to respond swiftly and strategically to the disturbing trends that are reshaping public health needs." Over 310,000 total data sources were used for the latest iteration, 30% of them new to this year's study. It includes 1,211 location-years of provisional all-age vital registration data, which had not previously been used, and which provide more timely information. The global health assessments outlined in three peer-reviewed capstones cover critical areas of the GBD: a demographic analysis, causes of death, and the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors. Among adolescents and young adults, the largest increase in deaths was registered among those aged 20 to 39 in high-income North America from 2011 to 2023, mainly due to suicide, drug overdose, and high quantities of alcohol. Advances in modeling for the GBD 2023 study showed mortality in children ages 5‚Äì14 in sub-Saharan Africa from 1950 to 2021 was higher than previously estimated, an increase driven by high rates of respiratory infections and tuberculosis, other infectious diseases, and unintentional injuries. New calculations also showed mortality in young adult females ages 15‚Äì29 in sub-Saharan Africa was 61% higher than previously estimated, mostly due to maternal mortality, road injuries, and meningitis. Causes of death are shifting from infectious to non-communicable diseases (NCDs), creating new global health challenges, particularly for low-income countries. After standing as the leading cause of death in 2021, COVID-19 plunged to the 20th place in 2023, putting ischemic heart disease and stroke back at the top, followed by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower respiratory infections, and neonatal disorders. The highest mean age of death was recorded in the high-income super-region, with females reaching 80.5 years and males at 74.4 years. The lowest mean age of death was in sub-Saharan Africa, with females at 37.1 years and males at 34.8 years. The all-cause probability of dying before age 70 decreased across each GBD super-region and region from 2000 to 2023, with drug use disorders as one of the leading causes. In sub-Saharan Africa, the probability increased for many NCDs, and the mean age of death from NCDs was lower than expected. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) accounted for nearly two-thirds of the world's total death and disability. The top three causes were ischemic heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Low-income regions also saw a sharp rise in NCDs, further constraining nations with limited resources. From 1990 to 2023, the age-standardized rate of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) fell 36%. From 2010 to 2023, DALY rates for communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases fell by almost 26%. Almost half of the global mortality and morbidity in 2023 was attributable to 88 modifiable risk factors. The 10 risk factors with the highest proportion of health loss were high systolic blood pressure, particulate matter pollution, smoking, high fasting plasma glucose, low birthweight and short gestation, high BMI, high LDL cholesterol, kidney dysfunction, child growth failure, and lead exposure. New GBD modeling methods for lead exposure, the 10th-leading risk, also revealed a direct link to cardiovascular diseases. Removing lead from fuel has contributed to substantial declines in exposure over the years, but it's still a common environmental contaminant that can be found in paint in older buildings, contaminated soil, water, spices, and many cooking utensils. Climate-sensitive risks, such as air pollution and heat, continue to have a more significant impact on global health. High temperatures are also exacerbating vulnerabilities in that same region, particularly the Sahel, by compounding the effects of drought, food insecurity, and displacement. In addition, sexual abuse and intimate partner violence were identified as preventable contributors to depression, anxiety, and other health consequences. For the 15 to 49 age group, the top two risks were unsafe sex and occupational injuries, followed by high BMI, high systolic blood pressure, and smoking. From 2010 to 2023, injury-related DALY rates decreased by 16% during the same time period. The burden of injuries was higher in males, particularly older children and young adults ages 10 to 24, accounting for more than double the total DALYs compared to that of females. The GBD 2023 study highlights the urgent need for policymakers to expand health priorities beyond reducing child mortality to include adolescents and young adults, particularly in areas with higher rates of mortality than previously known. These countries rely on global health funding for life-saving primary care, medicine, and vaccines. Without it, the gap is sure to widen."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People who experience food insecurity or loneliness are much more likely to develop chronic pain after surgery, according to new research presented at the ANESTHESIOLOGY¬Æ 2025 annual meeting. Chronic pain - lasting three months or longer - after surgery is common, especially after major procedures such as hip or knee replacement, and affects up to 30%-50% of surgical patients. Stress from loneliness can overstimulate the nervous system and make pain feel more severe. Also, a lack of social support can leave patients without help with tasks such as picking up medication or attending physical therapy, which can increase recovery time and the likelihood of pain becoming long-term. Our study provides strong evidence that a person's social situation may be just as important as their physical health when it comes to recovery. People who lack basic needs such as food and social connection may face a higher risk of long-term pain after surgery. But patients with strong support systems - whether from family, friends or community resources - are better protected. These findings highlight the importance for health care professionals to look beyond traditional medicine and consider the whole picture of a patient's life, from their dinner table to their support system, to help aid recovery." Overall, 641 patients (7.9%) developed chronic pain after surgery, which was defined as having persistent postoperative pain at least one year after surgery. "Patients should know that being open about their social and financial situation may be a crucial part of their recovery success after surgery," said Rodney Grabriel, M.D., MAS, co-author of the study and associate professor of anesthesiology at the University of California, San Diego. "They should feel empowered to discuss any concerns about food insecurity or a lack of social support with their doctors and nurses, who can help connect them to resources like food assistance programs or support groups, which may make recovery faster and lower their risk of ongoing pain." The researchers added that screening patients for these and other social factors before surgery can help clinicians intervene early and personalize pain management strategies. Integrating these factors into care plans can be key steps to improving recovery and reducing the risk of chronic pain for vulnerable patients.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Most children - including nearly 80% of infants - go without clear liquids before surgery for at least twice as long as guidelines recommend, according to an analysis of data on more than 70,000 children presented at the ANESTHESIOLOGY¬Æ 2025 annual meeting. Healthy infants and children may safely drink clear liquids, including water, fruit juices without pulp and carbohydrate-containing beverages, until two hours before receiving anesthesia, according to guidelines from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA). However, fasting longer can be harmful because it may cause dehydration, as well as unhealthy changes in blood sugar and other chemicals in the body. Prolonged fasting from clear liquids of four hours or longer can be uncomfortable and increase thirst, anxiety, pain, nausea and vomiting. Researchers reviewed records from 71,835 children, aged 17 or younger (3,771 of whom were infants younger than 1 year old), who had elective surgery at one of 12 U.S. hospitals between 2016 and 2024. In the study, prolonged fasting was defined as fasting from clear liquids for four hours (or longer) before surgery, which is two times longer (or more) than guidelines recommend. The median length of time all children fasted from clear liquids decreased overall from 10.9 hours in 2016 to 8.7 hours in 2024. While the study didn't address why parents and health care professionals withheld clear liquids from children for longer than recommended, there are likely several reasons: parents and physicians may be following outdated practices of prolonged fasting (e.g., nothing to drink after midnight); lack of awareness of ASA fasting guidelines that note "efforts should be made to allow clear liquids in healthy children as close to two hours before the procedure as possible;" and a lack of understanding that prolonged fasting can increase complications and negatively impact recovery. Perioperative team members should encourage patients to drink water and liquids with sugar for up to two hours before the procedure when appropriate, said Dr. Nagrebetsky. Parents should advocate for their children and ask their anesthesiologist about current recommendations for clear liquids before the procedure, he said. "The study confirmed our hypothesis that non-adherence to ASA fasting guidelines is common in the U.S.," said Ethan Lowder, B.A., lead study author and a student at Harvard Medical School. "Drinking sugar-containing clear liquids such as juices or those with electrolytes provides water and calories that children's bodies need for normal functioning, including dealing with the stress of surgery and recovery."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It is known that depression is linked to increased incidence of metabolic diseases; now scientists have discovered that different types of depression are linked to different cardiometabolic diseases. This work is presented at the ECNP Congress in Amsterdam. The team identified two distinct depressive profiles: one typified by "melancholic" symptoms (such as early morning awakening and reduced appetite), and another by "atypical/energy-related" symptoms (such as fatigue, increased sleep, and increased appetite). They showed no significant increase in cardiovascular disease. In contrast, those who had "melancholic" symptoms were around 1.5 times more at risk of cardiovascular disease (such as a heart attack, or stroke) than individuals without depressive symptoms, with no significant increase in type 2 diabetes. "Further metabolic analysis revealed that patients with the atypical/energy-related symptoms showed disruptions in inflammatory and metabolic processes linked to cardiometabolic health. This biological signature was not seen in those with "melancholic" symptoms, suggesting biochemical differences in the way that different types of depression link to cardiovascular health. We already knew that not all depressions are the same, but this means that we may need to consider how the type of depression someone has impacts different areas of their physical health. It very much pushes us towards the idea of precision psychiatry ‚Äì the idea that we need to look for physical associations with mental health profiles, so that we can better treat mental illness. "The prevention and treatment of physical diseases in people with depression are not less important than the treatment of depression. These physical conditions are common and expected to raise, for example the number of people with diabetes (66 million) in the EUR Region will see a 10% increase by 2050 according to the International Diabetes Federation. It is a health care priority to prevent cardiometabolic diseases, diagnose them early, and continue to improve monitoring and treatment. This study on the NEO cohort provides highly valuable data on how to do this better for people suffering from depressive symptoms".

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Older patients who primarily speak a language other than English may face a greater risk of developing delirium after surgery in U.S. hospitals, according to new research presented at the ANESTHESIOLOGY¬Æ 2025 annual meeting. The study also found that a lower socioeconomic status further increased patients' risk. In certain high-risk patients, such as those with hip fractures, the incidence can be even higher. Our study provides evidence that speaking a first or primary language other than English is an independent risk factor for delirium in U.S. patients undergoing anesthesia for surgery, even after ruling out other factors such as prior diagnoses of sleep apnea and type and duration of surgery. We also found that delirium in these patients contributed to longer hospital stays, which can further delay recovery." U.S. health systems are providing care to increasingly diverse patient populations, including those whose first or primary language is not English. Before and after surgery, language barriers can contribute to confusion and agitation in patients, two factors that are associated with the development of postoperative delirium. Their analysis was adjusted for patient and procedural factors, including social determinants of health, such as socioeconomic status. Overall, 2,328 (4.7%) of the patients studied developed postoperative delirium - 2,093 whose primary language was English and 235 whose primary language was not English. Researchers concluded that patients whose primary language was not English were 23% more likely to develop delirium after surgery, than those whose primary language was English. Additionally, this risk was 31% higher in non-English-speaking patients with lower estimated household incomes. In patients who primarily spoke Spanish or other non-English languages, 151 of the 235 who developed delirium had interpreter support, but this did not reduce delirium risk. "While more research is needed on mechanisms, we suspect that greater confusion and fewer opportunities for verbal reorientation during this early postoperative phase may help explain the elevated delirium risk, even when interpreters are used." For example, assigning health care providers who speak the patient's language, ensuring family members are present to help with verbal reorientation, and seeing patients in the pre-admission testing clinic to identify risk factors for delirium can all help improve outcomes. However, the authors acknowledge that disparities in health care access and delivery are structural issues that need to be addressed beyond the individual patient level.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New mothers are more likely to experience severe pain that disrupts sleep and activities of daily living, as well as develop sleep disorders, if they give birth by cesarean delivery (C-section), suggests research presented at the ANESTHESIOLOGY¬Æ 2025 annual meeting. Moe Takenoshita, M.B.B.Ch., lead author of the study and postdoctoral scholar, department of anesthesia, Stanford University Center for Academic Medicine, Palo Alto, California For the qualitative analysis, the authors interviewed 41 mothers about their pain and sleep experiences after childbirth, 24 of whom had vaginal births, 11 who had scheduled C-sections and six whose C-sections were unplanned. For the quantitative study, the authors analyzed a nationwide insurance database of more than 1.5 million mothers who delivered babies between 2008 and 2021. They determined that individuals who have C-sections are 16% more likely to be diagnosed with a new sleep disorder (e.g., insomnia, sleep deprivation or obstructive sleep apnea) between a month and a year after giving birth, compared to those who delivered vaginally. New mothers, especially those recovering from C-sections, should be sure to manage pain adequately, since untreated pain can worsen sleep, said Dr. Takenoshita. Other measures that can help to improve sleep include regular exercise as appropriate, sleeping when the baby sleeps, avoiding caffeine or alcohol late in the day, and relaxing before bed by taking a bath or practicing deep breathing. "Those who are planning a C-section should understand that the procedure is linked to more severe pain after delivery and a higher risk of sleep disorders. Anyone having sleep problems during pregnancy or after childbirth should discuss their concerns with their physician, who can evaluate the issue, make recommendations and refer them to a specialist if necessary."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By confirming cognitive impairment before ordering amyloid blood tests, this two-step approach cuts false positives, streamlines referrals, and moves Alzheimer's diagnosis closer to everyday clinics. Study: Primary care detection of Alzheimer's disease using a self-administered digital cognitive test and blood biomarkers. In a recent study published in the journal Nature Medicine, researchers in Sweden and the United States assessed whether a brief self-administered digital cognitive battery, alone or combined with a blood-based amyloid biomarker panel, more accurately detects cognitive impairment and clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) in primary care than standard care. One in every three older adults worries about memory loss, yet many never receive a timely, accurate diagnosis. AD is the leading cause of dementia, driven by amyloid-beta (AŒ≤) deposition, tau aggregation, and neurodegeneration. Early stages like subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) often slip past brief paper tests such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), especially in rushed clinics. Blood tests like phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) are promising, yet pretest probabilities vary widely in primary care, with amyloid positivity generally lower in SCD and higher in MCI or dementia, influencing positive predictive value (PPV). International guidance increasingly emphasizes two-step workflows that confirm impairment before biomarker testing. Further research should validate efficient, accurate, and scalable frontline pathways. The investigators trained and validated BioCog, a tablet-based, self-administered test battery, across two Swedish cohorts. A secondary-care cohort from the BioFINDER-2 study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03174938) was used to build logistic-regression models and establish cutoffs; an independent primary-care cohort from 19 clinics in the BioFINDER-Primary Care study (NCT06120361) served for external validation. BioCog included a ten-word list (three immediate recalls, delayed recall, and delayed recognition), a cognitive processing-speed task, and items related to orientation to time. Model selection employed recursive feature elimination with Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and receiver-operating-characteristic area under the curve (AUC) for performance. One-cutoff and two-cutoff schemes were predefined; the latter created an intermediate zone to be resolved by further evaluation. Primary-care physicians (PCPs) performed standard evaluations, including MMSE, MoCA, computed tomography, and clinical judgment. A two-step workflow was tested: Step 1 involved BioCog to detect impairment; Step 2 involved a plasma panel (PrecivityAD2) generating the Amyloid Probability Score-2 (APS2) from AŒ≤42, AŒ≤40, p-tau217, and non-p-tau217. Sensitivity analyses used the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) global score ‚â•0.5 as an alternative impairment reference. Comparing a digital testing and blood biomarker-based diagnostic workflow to the current standard clinical evaluation in the primary care cohort. Comparisons were made on a subset of individuals with all existing data available (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ365; see Supplementary Table 17 for detailed population characteristics). Our proposed primary care two-step workflow consists of step 1, the detection of cognitive impairment using the BioCog, followed by step 2, a blood biomarker assessment to evaluate whether AD pathology is present in cognitively impaired individuals.

In secondary care (n=223; mean age 73 years), the best six-variable model (BioCog6: delayed recall, processing-speed correct, immediate recall performance, total time, age, and delayed recognition) achieved an AUC of 0.96 and 89% accuracy for objectively verified cognitive impairment at a single cutoff. A two-cutoff approach reached 96% accuracy with 18% of participants in an intermediate zone requiring follow-up. External validation in primary care (n=403; mean age 77 years) showed BioCog6 AUC 0.93 and 85% accuracy (positive predictive value [PPV] 87%, negative predictive value [NPV] 83%, sensitivity 88%, specificity 82%) using one cutoff, significantly outperforming PCP assessment (accuracy 73%) based on usual testing and imaging. Head-to-head comparisons favored BioCog6 over MMSE, MoCA, Mini-Cog, and the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) paired-associates learning, both in one-cutoff analyses and, where available, two-cutoff analyses, even after demographic adjustments. Critically, the two-step workflow tailored for primary care, BioCog first, then blood testing only for those objectively impaired, identified biomarker-verified clinical AD (impairment due to AD by expert consensus with CSF or AŒ≤-PET support) with 90% accuracy (PPV 83%, NPV 93%, specificity 92%, sensitivity 84%). This surpassed PCP-only pathways (accuracy 70%) and outperformed blood testing alone (accuracy 80%), which showed an approximate 17% false-positive rate when used without an impairment filter. Using two cutoffs for both BioCog and APS2 raised accuracy to 95% with a larger intermediate zone (about 30%), emphasizing a trade-off between certainty and indeterminate referrals. Findings were accurate when substituting CDR ‚â•0.5 for RBANS (primary metrics dipped modestly but remained high) and when removing age from the BioCog model. Interpretation centers on pretest probability: because only individuals with cognitive impairment (not SCD) are eligible for recently implemented AŒ≤-targeting immunotherapies, an efficient front-end filter that confirms impairment before blood biomarkers reduces false positives, improves PPV, and aligns with international recommendations and the World Health Organization's preferred product profile for blood tests. Digital delivery standardizes administration, captures timing features beyond raw scores, and minimizes personnel time, advantages for busy clinics facing growing demand. However, the authors caution that BioCog must complement, not replace, clinical judgment and that validation in other languages, cultures, and longitudinal settings is still required. When followed by a targeted blood-biomarker panel, it can diagnose clinical AD with substantially higher accuracy than the current standard-of-care. The stepwise ‚Äútest-then-blood‚Äù approach enhances diagnostic certainty, reduces inappropriate referrals, and prioritizes candidates for AŒ≤-targeting therapies. While generalizability beyond Swedish settings and longitudinal utility need further study, the pathway is practical, scalable, and consistent with international guidance: confirm impairment first, then use blood biomarkers to infer amyloid pathology, bringing earlier, more confident diagnoses within reach of routine clinics.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new global metric shows how everyday foods, from beef to coffee, carry vastly different extinction costs, exposing how our diets and imports quietly shape the future of Earth's wildlife. Study: Food impacts on species extinction risks can vary by three orders of magnitude. In a recent study published in the journal Nature Food, researchers leveraged global food production and consumption data (140 unique items) and a novel, high-resolution "LIFE" biodiversity metric to investigate the relative impacts of different foods on species extinction risk, using a metric they term "extinction opportunity costs." Animal products, especially ruminant meat, and commodities grown in the tropics (e.g., coffee and cocoa), were consistently observed to carry the highest species extinction risk. These findings elucidate the substantial relative costs of agricultural choices on ecology, thereby guiding future conservation and food production policy for sustainable outcomes. Temperate crops can be low-risk, High-yield crops grown in low-biodiversity regions, such as European sugar beet, which carry among the lowest extinction impacts per kilogram, a stark contrast to tropical sugar cane cultivated in biodiversity hotspots. The global food production system is increasingly recognized as a primary threat to nature, linked to substantial land-use change and habitat destruction for agriculture. Mitigating ongoing biodiversity loss associated with food production requires a robust understanding of which foods are most damaging and where they are produced, thereby informing conservation policy efforts. Unfortunately, previous attempts to quantify the biodiversity impacts of food have been limited. Standard methods like life-cycle analysis (LCA) often rely on subjective metrics, are limited in their spatial and taxonomic scope, and lack the spatial detail to account for the fact that crops grown in a tropical biodiversity hotspot have a vastly different impact than the same crops grown in a temperate region. A more sophisticated, globally consistent approach is required to inform effective interventions, from individual dietary choices to international trade policy. Tea, coffee, cocoa, and spices may be consumed sparingly, but they rank among the highest per-kg extinction drivers, especially when sourced from ecologically rich regions like Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, or the Andes. The present study addresses these knowledge gaps by developing a powerful new biodiversity metric called LIFE (Land-cover change Impacts on Future Extinctions), which leverages detailed global data on food production, consumption, and trade from the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). This cost represents the forgone opportunity to restore biodiversity that arises from continued agricultural land use. In essence, it measures the potential reduction in extinction risk if a parcel of farmland were returned to its natural habitat. Global variation across and within commodities in the expected extinction impact of producing 1‚Äâkg of agricultural commodity or commodity group. Where commodities are grouped, the per-kilogram extinction risk values of each constituent commodity are weighted by their contribution (by mass) to the total global production of that group. While less damaging than beef or lamb, dairy still demands significant land for grazing and feed, placing it well above legumes and grains in biodiversity cost - a reminder that ‚Äúmeat-free‚Äù is not always impact-free. Study findings revealed an unexpectedly high variation in the biodiversity impacts of different foods, spanning up to three orders of magnitude between foods with the lowest impacts versus those with the highest. Animal products were found to have a substantially greater effect on species extinction risk than staple plant-based foods. Specifically, the global median opportunity cost of ruminant meat (e.g., beef and lamb) was found to be approximately 340 times greater than that of grains by mass. "Luxury" crops grown in tropical regions (coffee, cocoa, and tea) also ranked among the most impactful commodities per kilogram. Crucially, the impact also varied dramatically by provenance for the same product; for example, coffee from South America and sub-Saharan Africa had an impact approximately ten times greater than that produced in Southeast Asia. Study analysis finally revealed that the biodiversity footprints of some nations are overwhelmingly externalized. Across all countries studied, ruminant meat was the dominant driver of per capita impacts. Even in India, where a third of the population is lacto-vegetarian, ruminant meats (mainly sheep and goat) were found to contribute to 40% of the country's total impact on species extinction due to food production. Despite widespread vegetarianism, India's extinction footprint is heavily driven by dairy and small ruminants (goat and sheep), which account for around 40% of the country's food-related biodiversity impact. Animal products, particularly ruminant meat, and foods grown in tropical biodiversity hotspots were revealed to carry an excessively disproportionate environmental burden. Study analysis underscores the immense potential for dietary change to mitigate harm. Encouragingly, data from the US-based scenario shows that shifting from a typical Western diet to the EAT-Lancet planetary health diet, with a reduction in ruminant meat consumption from 4% to 1%, reduces the extinction opportunity cost of an individual's diet by almost three-quarters. First, the analysis does not include all commodities, notably omitting aquatic foods, palm oil, and sugar due to data challenges. Second, the study relies on relatively coarse data and does not yet account for the intensity of agricultural production, such as intensive versus extensive grazing, or impacts on plants and invertebrates. Third, the authors stress that their metric is "marginal," meaning it is designed to compare the effect of one additional unit of a food and cannot be simply scaled up to calculate the total global impact of agriculture. Finally, the study focuses exclusively on extinction risk from land use, and does not measure other critical harms like those from fertilizer runoff, pesticide use, or greenhouse gas emissions. For example, while the UK and Japan "offshore" their biodiversity impact, the paper warns that policies promoting low-yielding domestic agriculture could inadvertently increase reliance on imports from more biodiverse regions, potentially causing a net increase in global biodiversity loss. These findings suggest that while the present scenario appears bleak, informed dietary changes and carefully considered policies may substantially improve future outcomes.
