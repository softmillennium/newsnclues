                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson were co-stars in the 2003 romantic comedy, ‚ÄúSomething's Gotta Give.‚Äù The pair delivered incredible performances, and the film was a hit, even earning Keaton an Academy Award nomination. However, there was one thing that the actress failed to do when signing onto the film: she did not negotiate a back end to her contract. But Nicholson would do something that left Keaton pleasantly surprised. In her memoir, she wrote about her shock ‚Äúwhen a check with a lot of zeros arrived in the mail for my back-end percentage,‚Äù Daily Mail reports. The money had come from Nicholson's ‚Äúhefty percentage of the film's gross earnings,‚Äù Daily Mail reports. In Keaton's memoir, she also revealed that she had initially thought the film would not do well at the box office but called it her ‚Äúfavorite film,‚Äù The Guardian reports. Keaton's acting was so convincing that Nicholson even believed she was in love with him. ‚ÄúWe're rehearsing that scene in the street, where he's running after her, and he calls me over after one rehearsal. He's all rattled,‚Äù director Nancy Meyers said at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2018, Vulture reports. I couldn't tell if he was horrified or thrilled. Keaton had an impressive career, and fans have taken a closer look at her life and the impact she had on Hollywood after her passing on October 11. The world has reacted with great sadness to Keaton's death, and a friend shared more information about the type of person she was. ‚ÄúShe lived exactly how she wanted to, which was on her own terms, surrounded by the people and things she really loved,‚Äù the friend said, People reports. ‚ÄúBeing in the spotlight wasn't important,‚Äù the source revealed, saying that Keaton loved being home with her golden retriever, Reggie. The friend continued, ‚ÄúDiane always had a very strong sense of who she was and how she wanted to live. In these last few years, she kept a close circle, and she liked it that way. She was funny right up until the end, and she had this way of making even ordinary moments feel special. Thank you for all the entertainment in my life from you.I have your movies that I replay (when I'm down) they always make me laugh and smile üòÉ at the world again.RIP MsKeaton and may G-D hold you and welcome you!!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Annie Hall was the result of Keaton's long-time collaboration with the now-canceled filmmaker Woody Allen, both when they were romantically involved and after. The movies she made with him are considered some of her most acclaimed work, with Keaton winning the Oscar for best actress for her titular performance in Annie Hall. Nancy Meyers Remembers "Giant" Diane Keaton: "I Lost a Friend of Almost 40 Years" Released in April 1977, Annie Hall earned a respectable $38.3 million at the domestic box office, not adjusted for inflation, while there is no way to put a price tag on its cultural impact. Keaton would earn three more Oscar nominations for best actress, culminating with director Nancy Meyers‚Äò Something's Gotta Give, an unexpected twist on the May-to-December plotline that co-stars Jack Nicholson and Keanu Reeves. That makes it the top-grossing live-action film of Keaton's career in a leading role, not adjusted for inflation. Other movie theater circuits are also likely to host Keaton retrospectives, while her films have quickly climbed up iTunes' movie rental chart since her passing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Club have spent months biting their nails at the prospect of another season filled with episodes that run upwards of 98 minutes‚Äînot to mention a two-and-a-half-hour finale. That's too many Eggos for a single Stephen King fanatic. Thankfully, in hopes of quelling the slow wave of anxiety cresting on his TV show's fanbase, Stranger Things co-creator Ross Duffer posted the ‚ÄúACTUAL‚Äù episode lengths on his Instagram page earlier today, and let's just say they're shorter than last season. In a post captioned ‚ÄúACTUAL runtimes,‚Äù Duffer revealed that the first three Chapters of season five run 68 minutes or less. Please, Mr. Duffer, tell us how we should conduct our lives. Anyway, here are the runtimes for your TV scheduling purposes: Per Variety, the post offers some relief from reports that each episode would run between 90 minutes and two hours. Season four saw the Duffers really stretch these episodes out, with all but one episode running longer than 70 minutes. For those who still have their calendars open, the first part of Stranger Things 5 premieres on November 26, and the final three episodes will premiere on December 31.

Universal Music Japan, he added, recently announced a deal with Japanese telecommunications company KDDI to develop new music experiences for fans and artists using the technology. ‚ÄúAnd to be clear ‚Äî and this is very important ‚Äî we will NOT license any model that uses an artist's voice or generates new songs which incorporate an artist's existing songs without their consent,‚Äù Grainge continued. He added that many AI companies' efforts to make it legal to train AI technology on copyrighted material with the consent of rights holders ‚Äúamount to nothing more than the unauthorized (and, we believe, illegal) exploitation of the rights and property of creative artists.‚Äù I am writing today to update you on the progress that we are making on our efforts to take advantage of the developing commercial opportunities presented by Gen AI technology for the benefit of all our artists and songwriters. UMG is playing a pioneering role in fostering AI's enormous potential. While our progress is significant, the speed at which this technology is developing makes it important that you are all continually updated on our efforts and well-versed on the strategy and approach. The foundation of what we're doing is the belief that together, we can foster a healthy commercial AI ecosystem in which artists, songwriters, music companies and technology companies can all flourish together. In fact, we were the first company to enter into AI-related agreements with companies ranging from major platforms such as YouTube, TikTok and Meta to emerging entrepreneurs such as BandLab, Soundlabs, and more. Both creatively and commercially our portfolio of AI partnerships continues to expand. Very recently, Universal Music Japan announced an agreement with KDDI, a leading Japanese telecommunications company, to develop new music experiences for fans and artists using Gen AI. And we are very actively engaged with nearly a dozen different companies on significant new products and service plans that hold promise for a dramatic expansion of the AI music landscape. While just scratching the surface of AI's enormous potential, Spotify's recent integration with ChatGPT offers a pathway to move fluidly from query and discovery to enjoyment of music‚Äîand all within a monetized ecosystem. Based on what we've done with our AI partners to date, and the new discussions that are underway, we can unequivocally say that AI has the potential to deliver creative tools that will enable us to connect our artists with their fans in new ways‚Äîand with advanced capability on a scale we've never encountered. Further, I believe that Agentic AI, which dynamically employs complex reasoning and adaptation, has the potential to revolutionize how fans interact with and discover music. I know that we will successfully navigate as well as seize these opportunities and that these new products could constitute a significant source of new future revenue for artists and songwriters. We will be actively engaged in discussing all of these developments with the entire creative community. We will only consider advancing AI products based on models that are trained responsibly. And to be clear‚Äîand this is very important‚Äîwe will NOT license any model that uses an artist's voice or generates new songs which incorporate an artist's existing songs without their consent. New AI products will be joined by many other similar ones that will soon be coming to market, and we have established teams throughout UMG that will be working with artists and their representatives to bring these opportunities directly to them. To be clear: all these misguided proposals amount to nothing more than the unauthorized (and, we believe, illegal) exploitation of the rights and property of creative artists. In addition, we are acting in the marketplace to see our partners embrace responsible and ethical AI policies and we're proud of the progress being made there. For example, having accurately predicted the rapid rise of AI ‚Äúslop‚Äù on streaming platforms, in 2023 we introduced Artist-Centric principles to combat what is essentially platform pollution. Further, we recently announced an agreement with SoundPatrol, a new company led by Stanford scientists that employs patented technology to protect artists' work from unauthorized use in AI music generators. So,  as we work to assure safeguards for artists, we will help lead the way forward, which is why we are exploring and finding innovative ways to use this revolutionary technology to create new commercial opportunities for artists and songwriters while simultaneously aiding and protecting human creativity.

It wasn't long ago that Apple looked like it would be making a big push into theatrical releases, believing what has been true for most other distributors: a theatrical release and its subsequent marketing push helps a movie's cachet once it (eventually) lands on streaming later. And with ‚ÄúF1: The Movie‚Äù in partnership with yet another distributor in Warner Bros., it found its biggest hit to date ‚Äî and quietly one of its biggest successes of the year at the box office ‚Äî grossing $629 million worldwide. Apple rewarded that success with a run in theaters that has lasted 14+ weeks, even as the film has already been available for premium rental since August. Few filmmakers get that sort of runway, but for Joseph Kosinski, who certainly did for ‚ÄúTop Gun: Maverick,‚Äù they were willing to give him the privilege, and his movie made the most of it. It'll be nearly six months since the film opened on June 27; a theatrical window like that is virtually unheard of. But that's no guarantee the same will happen to an Apple movie again. Despite its success, it wouldn't be a surprise if the ‚ÄúF1‚Äù theatrical experiment is over. After some success with ‚ÄúAir‚Äù and a few others, Amazon MGM is now all in, targeting as many as 14 theatrical releases a year and offering them beefy theatrical windows before they land on streaming. The studio is still doing some direct-to-streaming movies, but it has made clear its priorities. Apple, on the other hand, before ‚ÄúF1‚Äù had a string of costly misses and has since been rolling back that approach. The studio tried to placate the filmmakers by saying it had already greenlit a sequel to ‚ÄúWolfs,‚Äù but director Jon Watts openly said that after the theatrical fiasco, he ‚Äúno longer trusted‚Äù Apple as a creative partner. Since then, some of its higher-profile films have all been quietly and modestly released in theaters before landing on streaming, if they got a theatrical release at all, a stark contrast to what was agreed upon and stuck to with ‚ÄúF1.‚Äù Spike Lee's ‚ÄúHighest 2 Lowest‚Äù spent a couple weeks in theaters, grossing just a reported $1.5 million, before hitting the streaming service. Paul Greengrass' ‚ÄúThe Lost Bus‚Äù did the same, opening in just a few select theaters and did not report box office totals. Back in March, a report suggested that Apple TV loses $1 billion a year on streaming and has in the vicinity of 45 million subscribers. The company also has never been bound to one approach, and it stands to reason that, if another project on the scale of ‚ÄúF1‚Äù with a director like Kosinski attached was on the table, it could pursue a similarly lengthy theatrical release strategy. Some of its upcoming movies sound like they could have that pedigree. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

The trailer goes on to tease some of the wild action set pieces Wright has concocted for the film, as well as Ben's steady realization that this already demented game is likely rigged. He links up with some ostensible underground figures, too, including one played by William H.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We are working in conjunction with other media outlets to resolve the situation. A spokesperson for CNN said, ‚ÄúWe will not be deflected from our duty to hold all three fairly and fully to account, and we will continue to report on the actions and decision-making processes of the U.S. government without fear or favor.‚Äù The Pentagon unveiled a new policy last month that required that information ‚Äúbe approved for public release by an appropriate authorizing official before it is released, even if it is unclassified.‚Äù The risk for news organizations that signed it was that their reporters could lose their credentials for access to the complex. Journalism groups consulted with Pentagon press officials about changes to the policy, but even after the revisions, still found it too restrictive. Last week, the Pentagon Press Association said that the policy still ‚Äúleaves open the threat of the Department of Defense revoking credentials for reporters who exercise their First Amendment rights by seeking information that hasn't been pre-approved for formal release, even when the information is entirely unclassified.‚Äù The press association said that the policy also ‚Äúconveys an unprecedented message of intimidation to everyone within the DoD, warning against unapproved interactions with the press and even suggesting it's criminal to speak without express permission ‚Äî which plainly, it's not.‚Äù Some journalists argued that such activity as posting a call for tips on social media would run afoul of the rules. The press association, in a new statement issued on Monday, said that most of its members ‚Äúseem likely to hand over their badges rather than acknowledge a policy that gags Pentagon employees and threatens retaliation against reporters who seek out information that has not been pre-approved for release.‚Äù Richard Stevenson, Washington bureau chief for The New York Times, said that the policy threatens to punish journalists ‚Äúfor ordinary news gathering protected by the First Amendment. Since the policy was first announced, we have expressed concerns that it constrains how journalists can report on the U.S. military, which is funded by $1 trillion in taxpayer dollars annually.‚Äù Throughout the day on Monday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has responded to news outlets announcing their refusal to sign with a hand ‚Äúbye-bye‚Äù emoji. Credentialed press no longer permitted to solicit criminal acts. Pentagon now has same rules as every U.S. military installation.‚Äù But some veterans of the Pentagon press corps said that Hegseth is wrong, in that the press already has been displaying badges. nor did they have access to areas like classified spaces. Weijia Jiang, president of the White House Correspondents' Association, and Shaun Tandon, president of the State Department Correspondents' Association, said in a joint statement, ‚ÄúAccess inside the Pentagon has never been about convenience to reporters. Unfettered reporting on the U.S. military and its civilian leadership provides a service to those in uniform, veterans, their families and all Americans.‚Äù Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

You can read all about his big break 31 years in the making here, but for the rest of it we're publishing his cinematic journey in full. ‚ÄúWhen I learned of the news that this story would be published in IndieWire, I was emotional,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere's something about having ‚ÄòDreamscape' published that allows me to feel like I'm carrying forward a sense of, I call it in a way, I'm a reckless dreamer. I don't deny the dream in me.‚Äù One outcome leads you back to New York for the third time in nine years. It took you 31 years and 229 days to get here. If this is finally your moment, you need to savor it because there's no going back. Related Stories ‚ÄòF1: The Movie' Is Finally Coming to Streaming, but Don't Count on Other Apple TV Movies to Wait as Long This Is a Cinderella Story the Film Industry Needs When you grow up as the middle child of Fred and Barbara Kalema, the closest you'll ever get to creative expression is a Panasonic camcorder you won't be allowed to touch. It's 1998 and these cameras are flying off the shelves of RadioShack. One day when you're in the first grade, you'll come home from school and see one on your kitchen table. You know it's expensive because dad's footsteps get increasingly louder as he runs down the stairs from his bedroom. ‚ÄúHey, don't touch that!‚Äù In his thick Ugandan accent he yells this before welcoming you home. After the school year lets out, you'll board a plane to spend your third summer in Uganda. Mom is starting to show because she's due in six months, but it's dad who has The Toy strapped to his body like a newborn. Everyday he'll get up before 7:00 AM and go to The Site, the plot of land he bought next to his mother's house. The Site's two acres comprise Uganda's trademark red soil and sit on top of Buziga, one of the highest points in Kampala. 21 years after leaving during the Idi Amin regime, dad will finally have the education, career, and means to build a house he can call his own. This new home will prove to his 17 siblings that he successfully cashed in his ticket with Uncle Sam for a better life. At night dad will turn the lens on you. You'll wear your hat backwards, perform impromptu skits with Frederick, your older brother, and make the family laugh. When The Toy is pointed at you, it's like dad is Andy while you and Frederick become Woody and Buzz Lightyear. You'll go to infinity and beyond every night because The Toy will create a safe place for your self-expression to fly. Even when the power goes out like it will most nights, Auntie Beatrice will light up the living room with a kerosene lamp to keep the production rolling. If Uganda had anything like America's Funniest Home Videos, you definitely would have been on it. Sir, who is the woman sleeping on your shoulder? Who's your favorite character in Toy Story? The Toy is in your hands now. A few days after coming home you'll be playing Nintendo 64 in your bedroom. Dad will yell your name at the octave that lets you know you have less than ten seconds to make it down the stairs before he calls again. ‚ÄúWhat did I tell you about this?‚Äù You won't have the words to downplay your disobedience because the incriminating tunes of black and white static are bellowing out from the TV. In a few seconds you'll learn that your British Airways in-flight masterpiece came at the expense of his ‚Äò98 summer original that he filmed at The Site. In the deafening silence that connects you two, he'll hand out his Toygate verdict: ‚ÄúYou're never allowed to touch this again!‚Äù It'll be twenty-one years before you put your hands on another camera. As a first-generation Ugandan-American, your creativity will buckle under the false promises of assimilation. You'll attend two different churches because your parents pray separately. White kids will touch your hair at school. Every other Saturday will be spent at the Luganda Academy your parents start with their friends. After school you'll either be at Kumon lessons with the Desi kids, Tae-Kwon Do classes with the Koreans, or soccer practice playing on your neighbor's team. Every summer, you'll be the American cousin in Uganda because of your accent. Each room in this revolving door of cultural immersion will be its own sisyphean struggle for belonging. Only when you start playing basketball will you feel free from the pressures of having to fit in. You'll color your 7th grade science reports until Mrs. Baxter tells the entire class she's not a fan of your work. You'll take music recording, ceramics, painting, and improv in high school. Still, you'll attend the improv shows and spoken word open mics wishing you could borrow a modicum of confidence from the kid who hijacked The Toy at 30,000 feet. Then mom will blindside you: she is taking a job with the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland. Even though the contract is only for a year, she's betting on herself to get an extension because this is her dream job. She'll double down on the fact that this UN job will allow you to finish school without shouldering more student loan debt. It'll happen within the first ten days of your move. You'll be walking home from work when a streetlight will spark the idea. You'll run to CVS, buy the cheapest notebook you find, and sprint home before your vision evaporates over dinner plans. Two hours will feel like two minutes because words will come faster than you can write them. When you uber to Java Monkey in Decatur, Georgia a few nights later and sign up for the open mic, you'll be called sixth and perform that original spoken word poem about a retired Black athlete who misses playing under the lights. In a few days, mom will answer your phone call unaware that you're still high from the standing ovation you got. She's listening intently to your words, but her silence lasts too long. When you see the Whatsapp connection isn't lagging, you'll sober up and your voice will freeze instead. You've never known mom to be apathetic, so that chasm of silence will feel larger than the ocean separating you two. It's the type of job immigrant parents call home about. The kind that will turn you into a living trophy to display on their mantle of expectations. They'll fail to see that you're no longer willing to pay the price of being the only Black person in that room. That job will only ever be a trojan horse to disguise the idea that started to flow from your pen night after night. People will use ‚Äúblog‚Äù, ‚Äúpodcast‚Äù, and ‚Äúside hustle‚Äù to describe what you're doing even though you'll never utter those words yourself. Former colleagues will use predictably boring Silicon Valley jargon to question what you're building. You're writing about life after sports in your mid-twenties and your media company will enjoy a tiny amount of success for someone with no media experience. Your campus ambassador program will launch at 12 schools across the country. Former athletes working at companies like Qualcomm, Spotify, Google, and The New York Times will submit their own stories. Then one day, Sarah, the Vice President of a sports media brand will tell you she's unfortunately too busy to pen her story for you. When you walk into the Best Buy at Union Square the next day to buy a Canon Rebel T6, you'll hold that box as if you're five years old and never heard dad's footsteps coming down the stairs. You'll get so high from filming Sarah, that you'll run and gun five more interviews in three weeks. The extent of your new video department is you, the T6, your iPhone, and a Tascom lavalier mic B&H oversold you because you'll clearly know nothing about film equipment. Can you teach me how to edit videos? Lucky for you, she lives a few minutes from your Brooklyn apartment and is happy to start teaching you Premiere. If shooting these videos unlocks a creative door, editing them will give you keys to the building. I'm going to be in Miami next week. When Shane Battier accepts your ten word hail mary, you'll be too naive to know that his 30 minute window isn't enough time to do a shoot in an NBA arena. That night you'll buy the cheapest flight to South Beach and ask Joyzel, who you also went to college with, if she can bring her fancy Sony cameras. Lucky for you, Joyzel is from Miami and will be happy to direct your shoot in her hometown. I could rehash the similarities between that production and the adrenaline that marked your college basketball games. I'll just tell you what happens after Miami. You'll keep restarting it because her color grade, sound design, and graphics will put you in a trance. That sensation will be so overwhelming, you'll have no choice but to take a walk. Two hours will go by like 30 seconds because your feet won't stop moving toward whatever direction epiphanies lead. You'll be standing on the corner of 6th Ave and W Houston St when that burning in your chest will give way to a vision. After that day, all you'll want to do is feel that again and the only way you know how is to recapture the magic of Miami. Unfortunately, COVID won't care about your epiphany. In March of 2020, your fire to make videos will be extinguished by the pandemic's uncertainty. You'll binge watch all the Harry Potter movies on HBO Max. Quibi will come and go from your life quicker than Steph Curry's jump shot. You'll consume every Shantell Martin video on YouTube wondering if you'll ever be as bold as the lines she draws. Instead of making videos, you'll be glued to screens like babies who are given iPads by their parents to keep them quiet. Your restlessness will meet its match on Sunday, April 19th when you sit down to watch the first two episodes of The Last Dance. Two hours will go by like ten seconds because those images will make sense in ways they couldn't have before Miami. You've interviewed professional athletes, used two camera setups, and incorporated graphics into an edit. So when Eric B. and Rakim's ‚ÄúI Ain't No Joke‚Äù scores the montage of Michael Jordan's rookie season, you'll visualize that edit on a timeline in your head. The fading crowd audio under Magic Johnson's speechless. And those rainbow lens flares following MJ through the tunnel in Paris!? Of course the feeling in your chest will return. Over the next few weeks, you'll listen to Jason Hehir, the director of The Last Dance, on every podcast like a fiend who needs another hit of his story. When you hear him say where he went to college, that feeling in your chest will explode. You also went to a small liberal arts school in Western Massachusetts. In the silence of your Brooklyn apartment, you'll say four words that you are certain match that feeling in your chest. You won't have a clue how to make films at the level of The Last Dance and you won't know anyone who does. You won't even be sure if COVID will give you a real shot to figure it out. Without a shadow of a doubt, what you will know then, is that you spent your whole life climbing a mountain just to see the clarity of your own dream. I wish I could tell you that everything falls into place after this, but almost half a decade will go by. You'll move 13 times in that span, bouncing from cheap month-to-month sublets to make your money stretch before it houdinis. You'll even give up on New York twice. Telling stories will tide you over because it will be the first time that you'll ever reveal the pervasive feeling of otherness that accompanied your Ugandan-American upbringing. In just a few years your storytelling will be featured on NPR and you'll never lose any of The Moth's GrandSlam storytelling competitions you compete in. ‚ÄúHey Dave, I think you should apply to this‚Äù. On the morning of Friday August 16th, 2024 you'll finish your weekly 10-mile bike ride and come back to the apartment you have a day to move out of. It's been 89 days since you submitted your application. You just sold all your camera gear to fund tomorrow's move. When you lock eyes with that notification on your phone, your heart will race faster than it does when you're cycling. Your hands will shake to the point where you'll forget to breathe because your fate will hang precariously in the balance of what that email says. When you finally calm down enough to open it, you won't even get through the first line before dropping to your knees. You're 31 and have no credits to your name, but Industry Standard will believe in your story enough to offer you one of their five limited spots. Even though you dreamt of making films, you never imagined that your opportunity would come with an Assistant Editor job at Library Films, mentorship from Industry Standard, and support from Netflix. When you pick yourself off the floor, you'll call your younger brother, George, and the words will spill out like air released after a pressure valve bursts. I'm going to be working on a Netflix project. As you drive back to New York, you won't stop thinking about the price of your dream, how simple your life had to become to chase it, and your parents. The look in mom's eyes when she said she was uprooting her life again for the United Nations. In ways you never could have before, you'll see yourself in both of them‚Äì‚Äìyou left home to chase an uncertain path. Maybe mom and dad were never supposed to nurture your creativity just like their parents never drew them a blueprint on how to survive as immigrants. So yeah, as the middle child of Fred and Barbara Kalema, it will take you more than three decades to earn a real shot at a creative life.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nancy Meyers is the latest to pay tribute to Diane Keaton, honoring her legacy in Hollywood following Keaton's death on Saturday at age 79 Seeing all of your tributes to Diane has been a comfort,‚Äù Meyers posted on Instagram. A brilliant actress who time and again laid herself bare to tell our stories. Meyers and Keaton first worked together in 1987's Baby Boom and would collaborate again in 1991's Father of the Bride. In 1995, Meyers and Keaton reunited for Father of the Bride II and again in 2003 for Something's Gotta Give. We all search for that someone who really gets us, right? Well, with Diane, I believe we mutually had that,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúI always felt she really got me so writing for her made me better because I felt so secure in her hands. And I knew how hilarious she could be, not only with dialogue (which she said word for word as written but managed to always make it sound improvised) but she could be funny sitting at a dinner table or just walking into a room.‚Äù RELATED: Diane Keaton Tributes: Robert De Niro, Jane Fonda, Andy Garcia & More Remember ‚ÄúBrilliant, Beautiful, Extraordinary‚Äù Actress: ‚ÄúDiane Was Magic‚Äù Meyers went on to note Keaton's professionalism on the set, saying that ‚Äúshe made everything better‚Äù and saw her ‚Äúgive it her all‚Äù every day they worked together. ‚ÄúWhen I needed her to cry in scene after scene in Something's Gotta Give she went at it hard and then somehow made it funny,‚Äù Meyers said. ‚ÄúAnd I remember she would sometimes spin in a kind of goofy circle before a take to purposely get herself off balance or whatever she needed to shed so she could be in the moment. She was fearless, she was like nobody ever, she was born to be a movie star, her laugh could make your day and for me, knowing her and working with her ‚Äî changed my life.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You already know Queen Bey, now here comes King Lou. Louis Tomlinson just dropped the music video for his new song ‚ÄúLemonade‚Äù ‚Äî not to be confused with Beyonc√©'s iconic album of the same name ‚Äî and it's truly wacky. He then falls asleep and wakes up inside a fever dream, surrounded by a group of people in full-body yellow suits. ‚ÄúLemonade‚Äù serves as the lead single from Tomlinson's upcoming album, How Did I Get Here? The project ‚Äî which drops Jan. 23, 2026 ‚Äî will mark his third solo LP, and he has plans to embark on a North American tour in support of the album. He also will reunite with former One Direction bandmate Zayn Malik for an upcoming roadtrip docuseries on Netflix. But while there's much to be excited about on the horizon, How Did I Get Here? In a recent Rolling Stone UK cover story, Tomlinson opened up about how the loss of his former bandmate has been ‚Äúimpossibly difficult.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere's still a level in my head [where it feels] unjust and frustrating that he's not with us anymore,‚Äù he told the publication. ‚ÄúNaively, I thought that because at this point, I'm relatively well versed in grief for my age, that it might soften the blow.

He's been joined by guests galore over the course of the shows, including a surprise appearance from Belinda Carlisle, who popped by Saturday night's gig, Oct. 11, to perform two of her biggest songs. First, Carlisle bounded onstage to join Hagar for a lively rendition of the Go-Go's 1980 classic, ‚ÄúWe Got the Beat.‚Äù Carlisle then delivered her 1987 solo hit, ‚ÄúHeaven Is a Place on Earth,‚Äù with guitarist Steve Salas and the rest of Hagar's backing band lending the shimmering power-pop gem a crunchier, hard rock edge. Along with Carlisle, Hagar's ongoing birthday bash has featured appearances from guests like Anthrax vocalist Joey Belladonna, Van Halen bassist Michael Anthony, and Bon Jovi guitarist Phil X. Jerry Cantrell has also been a recurring guest, playing guitar on various tracks, including several Alice in Chains classics like ‚ÄúRooster,‚Äù ‚ÄúWould?‚Äù, and ‚ÄúMan in the Box.‚Äù What ‚ÄòMonster: The Ed Gein Story' Gets Right and Wrong MAGA's Unhinged Reaction to Bad Bunny at the Super Bowl: What's Happened So Far The Right's Secret Plan to Help Billionaires Buy Elections Cantrell has also guested on renditions of Van Halen's ‚ÄúAin't Talkin' ‚ÄòBout Love,‚Äù and a cover of the Beastie Boys' ‚Äú(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cooper's supporting part in the movie as a bearded, secondary goofball suggests that, in addition to writing and directing, he's also held the ambition to steal parts away from Jason Mantzoukas. One of the very first things we learn about Alex Novak (Will Arnett) as the movie opens is that he's heading toward divorce from his wife Tess (Laura Dern). That information crystallizes far sooner than what it is that either of them does for a living, or how old their two children are. They're both 10‚Äînot born at the same time but ‚ÄúIrish twins,‚Äù which is something we learn from Alex's stand-up routine. Comedy is not, however, Alex's actual profession; he has some kind of nebulous finance job that's supposed to be beside the point of his journey, but reads a little like Cooper saying, ‚ÄúI don't know, people have jobs with money, right?‚Äù Alex tries out stand-up on a whim, supposedly to avoid the $15 cover charge at a bar where he just wants to drown a little of his post-split misery. (He's living nearby in that reverse-NYC miracle, an apartment described as shabby but actually pretty nice, while Tess stays in the suburbs.) Alex is believably shaky his first time up at an open mic. He goes back for another shot of that adrenaline, and Cooper smartly depicts how intoxicating even a moderate hit of crowd approval can be under the right circumstances. Working from a screenplay he and Arnett wrote with Mark Chappell, inspired by English comedian John Bishop, Cooper doesn't throw Alex into a Star Is Born-style rags-to-riches story (not least because Alex is, by most standards, already rich). He doesn't even quit his job to pursue comedy, and it's neat to see Cooper working in a less operatic tone, his self-consciously artsy flourishes in support of a story that doesn't announce its own sober-faced importance. Cooper also seems mindful of the potential limits of another story where a middle-aged guy finds his spark again, if not fully certain how to turn Is This Thing On? Tess gets her own storyline, sort of, where she belatedly reclaims some of her lost satisfaction by coaching volleyball, the sport she once played at an Olympic level. It's mostly an unexplained decade-plus delay in Tess realizing that, hey, sometimes former athletes turn to coaching, and then finding instant success in her new field. As insufferable as it might have been to eavesdrop on too many real-life comics plying their trade alongside and offering insider wisdom to Arnett's enthusiastic newbie, that milieu is also where Is This Thing On? feels most electric, even unpredictable once it's clear, early on, that this won't end with Alex getting that Tonight Show gig. obviously prides itself in dropping into the action without a lot of exposition, yet Cooper can't resist circling back for some arguments that fill in those missing details. At their most clamorous, the family conflicts taste like warmed-over David O. Russell leftovers, without reaching the rococo heights of those films' wigged-out performances (including Cooper's in several of them). The lack of genuine messiness makes this one of several recent movies that guides characters through narratives like a therapy session, complete with an end-of-session mixture of neatness and ellipses, along with a sense that the supporting characters are just fodder for intense discussion rather than recognizable humans.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gigi Hadid just proved she's boyfriend Bradley Cooper's biggest fan. Congratulations to my love!‚Äù Hadid wrote on her Instagram Stories, sharing a photo of a large TV playing the film, as reported by E! She also congratulated stars Laura Dern, Will Arnett, Andra Day, and ‚Äúthe whole crew.‚Äù Hadid and Cooper, who have quietly been together for nearly two years, rarely share glimpses of their relationship. Her loving message was a rare and touching show of support that delighted fans. Cooper, 50, revealed that his 8-year-old daughter, Lea, whom he shares with ex Irina Shayk, has become a big part of his creative process. Cooper added that Lea even helps him with casting decisions. Even with casting, we'll look at auditions together.‚Äù Hadid recently opened up about how Cooper's creative spirit has inspired her to take more risks. The mom of one auditioned for Rapunzel in Disney's live-action Tangled, telling Vogue, ‚ÄúI was really proud of my scene. I knew they were going to go with a real singer.‚Äù ‚ÄúI respect him so much as a creative,‚Äù Hadid added. ‚ÄúHe gives me so much encouragement and belief. Now, as the two continue to balance busy careers and parenthood, they continue to show support for each other. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.
