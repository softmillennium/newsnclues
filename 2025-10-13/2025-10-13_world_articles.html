                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two members of Israel's Knesset were removed from the chamber after holding up pro-Palestinian signs during US President Donald Trump's speech on Monday. Ayman Odeh and Ofer Cassif, from the mainly Arab Hadash-Ta'al coalition, held signs reading “Recognize Palestine!” –prompting immediate uproar from other legislators. Trump paused and stood silent as the MPs were quickly escorted out. He then remarked, “That was very efficient,” before continuing his speech. Cassif defended his actions on X, writing that Trump was “part of the problem, not a solution,” and that “true peace requires an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.” Odeh also defended his stunt, writing, “They kicked me out of the Knesset just for raising the simplest demand, one that the whole international community agrees on: Recognize the State of Palestine!” Hadash-Ta'al MKs Ayman Odeh and Ofer Cassif removed from Trump's speech after holding up signs calling to “recognize Palestine.”Trump quips that the ejection was “very efficient.” pic.twitter.com/0tvs7JbSAS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed Trump as the “greatest friend” Israel has ever had. Later that day, Trump signed the Gaza ceasefire deal with mediators from Egypt, Qatar, and Türkiye in Sharm el-Sheikh, on Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In breach of the international law, the Kiev government is using terrorist methods against civilians in Russia, but all terrorists and war criminals will face an inevitable punishment, said Natalya Nikonorova, a member of the Russian Federation Council (upper house of parliament) Committee on Foreign Affairs. On Monday, it became known that operatives from the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) have foiled a terrorist attack in Moscow against a high-ranking officer from Russia's Defense Ministry, which was plotted by Ukrainian special services jointly with the Islamic State terrorist group (outlawed in Russia). "Using radical suicide bombers, committing attacks with generally dangerous methods aimed at inflicting as much suffering as possible, cynical recognition of the past and future crimes - this is what terrorists normally do. Russian troops are fighting on the battlefield, while Kiev's death squads are covertly and dastardly try to wage some sort of ‘warfare' way behind the frontline, choosing civilians as their target," she said. In her words, such actions violate the universally recognized norms of the international law. On October 13, the FSB said it had prevented a sabotage and terror attack against one of the high-ranking officers of Russia's Defense Ministry. The attack was supposed to be carried out in one of the Russian capital's densely populated areas. The detainee said that he had planted it in a bicycle near the building's entrance. According to specialists, the yield of the explosive device would have ensured a lethal radius of up to 70 meters. Following the prevented terrorist attack, the FSB's Investigative Directorate has opened a criminal case on plotting a terror attack and the illegal use of explosive materials or devices.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The S&P/TSX Composite Index is up more than 26 per cent year-over-year.Tijana Martin/The Canadian Press John Rapley is a contributing columnist for The Globe and Mail. He is an author and academic whose books include Why Empires Fall and Twilight of the Money Gods. Is it 1999 all over again in the markets? But on Monday they parred back most losses as rhetoric cooled. With the S&P/TSX Composite Index up more than 20 per cent year-over-year, a twenty-something living at home and socking money into shares can look forward to retiring at 40. Analysts are now predicting that the S&P500 could hit 9,000 next year. That's because the world is awash with money, its biggest economies flooded with cash by free-spending governments and laid-back central banks. Government debt is surging in the U.S. and China as governments there try to boost their economies. The election of a new prime minister in Japan has further raised the prospects of stimulus in that country, thus encouraging investors and banks to loosen their purse strings. Equally, there's a growing expectation among investors that France's political crisis will cause the European Central Bank to once again do “whatever it takes” to rescue the euro, printing money in order to keep French bonds from collapsing. Across Europe, populist parties snap at the heels of governments and promise lavish spending if they take office. That's making it hard for governments to rein in spending and causing some to open the taps, especially in Germany. Despite this, monetary policy almost everywhere in the developing world remains fairly easy. Rather than raise interest rates to keep inflation low, most central banks are holding pat or even cutting, anxious not to slow economic growth. With central banks thus unwilling to defend the value of their currencies, investment banks are starting to advise clients to go all in on the “debasement trade”: buying assets, any assets, fast before the value of money declines. The rally may be more sustainable: AI companies are actually making things, such as chips and data centres, whereas many of the dot-com companies were little more than promises. However, the fallout from a crash, if it happens, could be worse. The U.S. national debt was less than half what it is today, and its budget was in surplus, leaving the government with ample resources to fight a recession. This time around, public finances are so stretched that any further spending increases will drive interest rates up. This time around, half the spending is being done by the top 10 per cent of earners, leaving the majority feeling worse off because of inflation, slowing wage growth and a sluggish job market. Unhappiness over this state of affairs is particularly strong among young people. The suicide rate in the U.S. has risen more than 50 per cent between 1999 and today, driven by higher youth rates. Here in Canada, research has also tracked a sharp drop in happiness among young people, driven largely by the high cost of living. So whereas the 2000 U.S. election was a civilized affair conducted over how to spend the emerging massive government surplus – whether to spend it on Social Security or tax cuts – future elections will likely be fought over defining the enemy. The stock market party thus hides an underlying reality: This boom may be on borrowed time, and the bill keeps rising. When it comes due, the reckoning over who should pay it could be harsher than in the past.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Barack Obama took aim at institutions and businesses who made deals or worked out settlements with the Trump administration, noting on a new podcast episode: “We all have this capacity, I think, to take a stand.” In a talk with Marc Maron on the comedian's last edition of his long-running WTF With Marc Maron, the former US president said institutions – including law firms, universities and businesses – that have changed course during the Trump administration should have stood by their convictions. Instead of bending to the administration, Obama noted that universities should say: “This will hurt if we lose some grant money in the federal government, but that's what endowments are for. Obama, whose two terms preceded the first Trump administration, also said that companies should also have stood up against administration pressure campaign to turn back from diversity hiring. “We think it's important, because of what this country is, to hire people from different backgrounds,” Obama said. Universities, law firms and other businesses have all reached agreements with the White House, including dropping DEI targets and agreeing to rein in campus antisemitism in exchange for restoration of federal funding. A series of powerful Washington law firms have also agreed to provide free legal services to the administration, while corporations have rolled back diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Elsewhere in the interview, Obama acknowledged that integrity comes at a price. “Sometimes it's going to be uncomfortable,” he told Maron, referencing a joke that Maron made in his stand-up routine that Democrats annoyed the average American into fascism.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Madagascar's president has fled the African nation, the head of the opposition and other officials said on Monday, the second time that young protesters have toppled a government in weeks of worldwide Gen Z unrest. Siteny Randrianasoloniaiko, leader of the opposition in parliament, told Reuters that President Andry Rajoelina left Madagascar on Sunday after units of the army defected and joined the protesters. The president's office, which had earlier said Rajoelina would address the nation at 7 p.m. local time on Monday, did not reply to requests for comment. A military source told Reuters that Rajoelina flew out of the country on a French military aircraft on Sunday. French radio RFI said he had struck a deal with President Emmanuel Macron. The source said that a French Army Casa aircraft landed in Madagascar's Sainte Marie airport on Sunday. Demonstrations had erupted in the former French colony on September 25 over water and power shortages but quickly escalated into an uprising over broader grievances, including corruption, bad governance and lack of basic services. The anger mirrors recent protests against ruling elites in countries including Nepal, where the prime minister was forced to resign last month, and Morocco. Rajoelina had appeared increasingly isolated after losing the support of CAPSAT, an elite unit which had helped him seize power in a 2009 coup. It then said it was taking charge of the military and appointed a new army chief, prompting Rajoelina to warn on Sunday of an attempt to seize power in the island nation off the coast of southern Africa. The president of the Senate – a focus of public anger during the protests – was relieved of his functions, the Senate said in a statement, and Jean André Ndremanjary was appointed on a temporary basis. On Monday, thousands of people gathered in a square in the capital, shouting “the president must quit now”. Hotel worker Adrianarivony Fanomegantsoa, 22, told Reuters his 300,000-ariary ($67) monthly salary was barely enough to cover food, explaining his reasons for joining the protests. “In 16 years the president and his government have done nothing except enrich themselves while the people stay poor. At least 22 people have been killed in clashes between protesters and the security forces since September 25, according to the UN. Madagascar, where the median age is younger than 20, has a population of about 30 million – three-quarters of whom live in poverty, with GDP per capita plunging 45% between independence in 1960 and 2020, according to the World Bank. While the country is best known for producing most of the world's vanilla, other exports including nickel, cobalt, textiles and shrimp are also vital to foreign earnings and employment.</p>

As families on Monday celebrated the return of about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and 20 living Israeli hostages after the two-year Israeli bombardment that has killed more than 67,000 people and left rubble across Gaza, advocates demanded the return of Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, who was captured nearly a year ago and has reportedly been imprisoned in a detention center known for torturing detainees. Middle East Eye reported Monday morning that according to Israeli media reports, Abu Safiya was on a list of Palestinian prisoners who would be released only “if the number of those released is not completed.” “The government has approved the creation of a reserve list of five prisoners from Gaza, who will be released if changes are made,” according to Israeli media reports. Palestinian writer and poet Mosab Abu Toha noted that “if he and the others are approved, they would replace five other Palestinian hostages who were previously set for release.” I'm not sure who else has shared this, but regarding Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, his name, along with four others, has reportedly been submitted for approval by the Israeli government. I have studied the impacts of settler colonialism on health, locally and abroad. I am demanding for the immediate and unconditional release of Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya who is being held captive by the Israeli military for fulfilling his duty and calling to protect his patients,” said Dr. Yipeng Ge. “I am calling for protection of hospitals, patients, and health workers in Gaza.” The prisoners being released on Monday include 1,700 Palestinians who were detained after Israel began its bombardment of Gaza in retaliation for a Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023. At least 154 Palestinian prisoners freed on Monday were forced into exile by Israel and deported to third countries. “There cannot be peace without justice, human rights, and dignity of ALL,” said Albanese.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia is ready to test European borders and escalate the current tensions into an open confrontation at any moment, German intelligence head Martin Jaeger told German lawmakers on Oct. 13. The comments echo warnings by Western officials about Moscow's escalating hybrid operations across Europe, including drone incursions, sabotage, and cyberattacks. While NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte warned that Russia will be ready for an open military clash with the alliance in five years, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz noted that the ongoing hybrid campaign means Europe is already no longer at peace. "Russia is concealing its true intentions, but in fact it's probing our borders," Jaeger told the Bundestag. "At best, Europe is in a state of cold peace — one that could flare into a hot confrontation at any moment." The head of Germany's Federal Intelligence Service (BND), who previously served as an ambassador to Kyiv, warned that Russia will interpret restraint as weakness, adding, "We must confront our adversaries wherever necessary." Friction between NATO and Moscow has intensified since the allies rallied behind Kyiv after Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Recent weeks saw the tensions surge further after Russian drones and aircraft repeatedly violated allied airspace. Suspicious drone sightings also caused disruptions to air traffic in Germany, Denmark, and Norway. In early September, Polish and allied forces shot down several Russian drones over Poland's territory, marking the first such instance since the outbreak of Moscow's full-scale invasion. The incursions prompted calls for strengthening allied defenses, while some NATO members urged downing Russian aircraft if necessary. Martin Fornusek is a news editor at the Kyiv Independent. He has previously worked as a news content editor at the media company Newsmatics and is a contributor to Euromaidan Press. He was also volunteering as an editor and translator at the Czech-language version of Ukraïner. Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov issued a new round of veiled threats towards Moldova on Oct. 12, warning Chisinau not to suffer from the same fate as Ukraine just weeks after an election that saw Moldova's pro-European Action and Solidarity Party (PAS) secure a parliamentary majority. On the battlefield dominated by drones, constant surveillance, and high-risk rotations, they navigate daily life and combat in one of the war's most dangerous sectors. Ukrainian troops have liberated the village of Mali Shcherbaky in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukraine's 24th Separate Assault Battalion "Aidar" announced on Oct. 12, releasing footage purportedly showing Ukrainian soldiers in the settlement.</p>

The disruption reportedly affected parts of the live transmission, though the broadcaster did not specify the source of the interference.

The broadcaster's news channel, TVP Info, reported that “there was foreign interference with the satellite links through which the Lithuania–Poland match was being broadcast,” citing information from satellite operator Eutelsat. Officials said the incident was under investigation as efforts continued to identify those responsible for the attack.

The match was held in Kaunas, southern Lithuania, where around 5,000 Polish fans were in attendance. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk also watched the game from the stands.

Poland ultimately defeated Lithuania 2–0 in the Group G World Cup qualifier, strengthening their hold on second place behind the Netherlands.

This time, the three countries in Pyongyang once again demonstrated their solidarity. The collusion between North Korea, China and Russia that ignores international law and attempts to rewrite the order cannot be overlooked. Alongside Kim Jong Un, the party's general secretary, Chinese Premier Li Qiang and former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev were among those who watched the parade. The bizarre aspect is that the key figures from China and Russia — permanent members of the Security Council who should bear responsibility for world peace and stability — have observed this very development. It has been pointed out that North Korea possesses about 2 tons of highly enriched uranium that could be used in nuclear weapons and is capable of producing 100 nuclear warheads. China and Russia once opposed North Korea for possessing nuclear weapons, but some observers believe they have shifted to not pursuing Pyongyang's denuclearization. North Korea's nuclear development poses a serious threat to the international community and must never be tolerated. Russia invaded Ukraine, and North Korea has also joined in by dispatching troops there. Advanced weapons such as drone-launching vehicles and hypersonic missiles, which are considered difficult to intercept, also made appearances. “Our army should continue to grow into an invincible entity that destroys all threats approaching our range of self-defense,” Kim said in his speech. A concerning aspect is that U.S. President Donald Trump is seeking to break the deadlock through a summit with Kim, as he did during his first term. If Trump makes concessions to Pyongyang, such as allowing possession of nuclear weapons and medium- and short-range ballistic missiles in exchange for scrapping ICBMs capable of reaching the U.S. mainland, it could jeopardize regional security. Japan and South Korea, both U.S. allies, must persistently urge Trump not to rush into a hasty deal with Pyongyang.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. Beatrice Magistro, Sophie Borwein, R. Michael Alvarez, Bart Bonikowski, and Peter John Loewen In May, IBM declared that it had fired hundreds of employees and replaced them with artificial intelligence chatbots. Over the summer, Salesforce let go of large numbers of people thanks to AI; UPS, JPMorgan Chase, and Wendy's are also slashing head counts as they automate more functions. Artificial intelligence will likely create new employment opportunities even as it disrupts existing ones, and economists disagree on whether the net effect will be job losses, job gains, or simply restructuring. But whatever the long-term consequences are, AI will soon become a major political issue. If there is significant disruption, officials will be confronted by workers furious about jobs lost to machines. Voters will make their frustrations known at the ballot box. Politicians will therefore have to come up with plans for protecting their constituents, and fast. To create an effective strategy for addressing large-scale AI disruption, however, policymakers will need to understand how workers themselves perceive the technological threat. In November 2023, we surveyed 6,000 Americans and Canadians to gauge their level of concern about AI-induced mass layoffs and how the government should deal with the issue. When it comes to policy preferences, however, there is ground for both optimism and pessimism. On the positive side of the ledger, most respondents favored measures such as retraining programs and expanded safety nets—technocratic fixes that economists believe can work. But on the negative side, many also supported new trade restrictions and immigration barriers, strategies that could make the problem even worse and that governments may well be tempted, for political reasons, to adopt. Multiple countries, after all, responded to the layoffs created by offshoring with harsh tariffs and more deportations—even though neither technique worked. If they are serious about solving the problem and not incurring another round of populist backlash, policymakers should start rolling out the right responses now, before AI layoffs ramp up and while the most effective solutions still command widespread support. Instead, we wrote 81 scenarios involving either AI adoption or offshoring in which the economic shock had different effects on employment and prices. We then gave respondents four of these scenarios to examine, each randomly chosen. We also presented respondents with a menu of possible policy responses—retraining programs, an expansion of the safety net, regulations to govern the economic shock they had seen (either AI deployment or offshoring), trade barriers, and immigration restrictions—and asked whether they supported each one. Respondents were randomly asked to evaluate either AI or offshoring scenarios, not both, allowing us to compare whether voters responded differently to domestic technological change versus foreign competition, and whether similar economic tradeoffs generated similar policy preferences across different types of disruption. Regardless of what political party they belonged to, respondents in both countries ranked worker retraining as their preferred policy. Technological change can be slowed, but it is almost impossible to stop, and so the best thing governments can do for affected citizens is to give them new skills, set sensible guardrails, and create new unemployment benefits. The problem is that governments today rarely put these policies into practice. In response to recent economic shocks, such as when trade slashed manufacturing jobs from wealthy countries, most states did not set up large retraining systems. And safety-net expansions look even less likely, particularly at a time when many governments are laden with debt. In fact, Washington is slashing social programs, including public health insurance and nutritional assistance, as part of U.S. President Donald Trump's signature July spending bill. Optimists might hope that as AI-induced disruption increases, policymakers will feel compelled to invest in retraining, social programs, regulations, or some combination thereof. When it comes to economic dislocation, politicians face what social scientists call time-inconsistency problems. The biggest risk, however, may not be that governments will ignore effective fixes. If a government can't shield its people from competition by robots, then at least it can protect them from competition by foreigners. But this zero-sum logic does not hold up in practice. Virtually every piece of research suggests that restricting immigration and trade will not stop companies from adopting AI. Reducing trade, for example, will raise input costs, shrink export markets, and heighten policy uncertainty—pressures that make labor-saving technologies such as automation more attractive in exposed industries. Reducing immigration will further encourage AI use by increasing labor costs. But protectionism often polls quite well, and substantial numbers of people already support such steps as responses to AI shocks. Among Republicans, the pattern is even more striking: support for immigration restrictions averaged 4.0 out of 5.0, making it their single most popular policy response, even higher than retraining. Trade restrictions came in at 3.5 among Republicans, roughly equal to retraining and well ahead of social spending. If AI layoffs keep rising, those figures could prove to be low-water marks. According to a study by the political scientist Nicole Wu, when Americans are told that robots threaten employment, Republicans become markedly more hostile to immigrants while Democrats turn against trade. Almost no one favors slowing the pace of AI itself. There are other reasons why politicians might turn to exclusionary policies. One is that there are comparatively few barriers to implementing these kinds of measures. To set up and fund retraining programs, regulate AI, or expand social welfare, most governments would need to pass legislation and appropriate significant amounts of government spending. Deporting migrants, by contrast, rarely requires fresh laws, and can thus be done relatively quickly. Finally, nativism and protectionism offer voters someone or something to blame. It is easier, after all, to be angry at foreign workers and foreign products than it is to be angry at technological progress. In fact, some states and parties that have traditionally been hostile to immigration, including the Japanese government, are even outwardly promoting AI as a substitute for foreign workers. They could set up new income support programs for people caught between jobs. Finally, they could pass laws that regulate AI by requiring transparency in automated decision-making, mandating human oversight for high-stakes applications, and establishing liability frameworks for AI-caused harms, which would slow the most disruptive applications and ensure safer deployment without stifling innovation. Governments could pay for these proposals by taxing large AI companies. These policies would not only help millions of workers. By acknowledging workers who lose their employment to AI and offering them assistance, officials would demonstrate to voters that the state can, in fact, address their needs. In doing so, politicians would bolster their own political fortunes. According to research by the political economist Yotam Margalit, during the George W. Bush administration, incumbent parties performed better in counties where a larger share of laid-off workers qualified for retraining programs—evidence that voters' access to government support mutes their potential political backlash to job loss. (The United States has funded retraining programs, but not nearly enough.) AI adoption is accelerating, and its deleterious effects on employment are no longer a speculative problem. Adaptive policies, meanwhile, will take years to yield results. BEATRICE MAGISTRO is Assistant Professor of AI Governance at Northeastern University.
