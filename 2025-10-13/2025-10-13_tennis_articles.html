                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What separates Coco Gauff right now isn't power or pace. At the pivotal juncture of 4-all in Sunday's opening set, Coco Gauff hit three of her four aces in a single game. Down 5-3 in the second set, Gauff ran off 10 straight points on the way to a 6-4, 7-5 victory over Jessica Pegula. Gauff, your Dongfeng Voyah ¬∑ Wuhan Open champion, is the consummate closer. She has played in nine Hologic WTA Tour hard-court finals -- and won them all. ‚ÄúOh, wow,‚Äù Gauff said on hearing that statistic, then burst into laughter during a conversation with wtatennis.com. Mixing speeds and spins with a variety of slices like a crafty veteran pitcher, the 21-year-old American kept the ball in play and consistently prevailed in the longer rallies. The weary Pegula, who thrives on an opponent's pace, had little to work with. Coming into the final, Pegula had played eight consecutive three-set matches. Including Beijing, her two-week total was a staggering 28 sets. Friendly suggestion: Don't try this at home. Gauff, who lost in WTA 1000 finals earlier this year on the clay in Madrid and Rome, collected her third career 1000 title. For the record, Gauff is a resplendent 22-3 in China. ‚ÄúI think it's a combination of the timing of the season, knowing that you're so close to the season being over that you're just like, ‚ÄòWhatever happens, happens,'‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd also the conditions here I feel like favor my game. The courts in Beijing were a little bit quicker and then here a little bit slower. The win underlined what has become an interesting -- and hugely successful -- pattern. ‚ÄúIt's not anything against the coaches I worked with -- I can still be at the top and want to get better. It's not always about what they say -- maybe they're saying similar things -- but maybe the approach is a little bit different and I'm able to receive it better. I don't want to make changes anymore. You looked like a crafty baseball pitcher out there, changing speeds and spins ‚Ä¶ what prompted you to go with that strategy against Jess? Playing Jess, she's a really great ball-striker. Honestly, it wasn't always a part of the plan, but I was just thinking it was the shot I had to do in the moment. Today was also cooler than the earlier rounds, and the court was playing slow, so I felt like hitting winners and powering through would be pretty hard because the court was just so slow. Neither of you showed much emotion during the match. At times it was like watching Venus and Serena Williams play each other ‚Ä¶ How difficult is it to play such a good friend? It's definitely difficult playing a friend in the final. I don't do it intentionally, but maybe I am a little more chill in the reactions and stuff. Jess is always calm, she doesn't let out too much. Working with Gavin MacMillan, where would you say your serve is right now? But I definitely think it's been a big improvement since Cincinnati and New York to now. Now I have a solution, and it's continuing to trust that when the moments get tight. I don't want to get too specific, but if you look at the before and after, I'm turning a little bit more on my toss. What will the next few weeks look like for you? Just going home [to South Florida] and training, getting ready for Riyadh. What are your goals and expectations for the WTA Finals? I'm just going to go in with no expectations. I just want to make it out of my group. That's what my goal was last year. What separates Coco Gauff right now isn't power or pace.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's been a memorable world-wind trip to the Rolex Shanghai Masters for Melanie-Antoinette de Massy, president of the Monegasque Tennis Federation, Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters and the Monte-Carlo Country Club. De Massy arrived in Shanghai at midday Friday after a 20-hour trip from Monaco with Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters tournament director David Massey. On Saturday, de Massy sat in Valentin Vacherot's guest box along with Massey to see her countryman defeat four-time Rolex Shanghai Masters champion and World No. Twenty-four hours later, de Massy was back in Vacherot's box to see history being made as the 26-year-old rallied from a set down to defeat his cousin Arthur Rinderknech 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 and become the first player from Monaco in the Open Era to win an ATP Tour singles title. "I am so, so proud of him and there's really no words that come to mind to describe really the feelings throughout the match," said de Massy. "He played incredibly well and the match was fantastic. We saw really some amazing points, fantastic tennis and I'm so glad to be here. I'm so glad to live this moment with him and so happy to see this historical final." De Massy's phone has been receiving nonstop messages from well wishers back home as well as interview requests. Avid tennis fan  Prince Albert II of Monaco followed closely Vacherot's historic run in Shanghai and was messaging de Massy before and during the championship match. During the final, de Massy said she received several WhatsApp messages from Prince Albert II and afterwards he spoke to her along with Vacherot. "We spoke for 10 to 15 minutes after the match and he was so thrilled, then Prince Albert spoke to Val for about 10 minutes," said de Massy, who received close to 100 messages after the final. "He was very touched by Val's words in the award ceremony and was proud of Val's results. David Massey and Melanie-Antoinette de Massy supporting Vacherot in Shanghai. There was a watch party at the Monte-Carlo Country Club with members and many of the top junior players in Monaco. I knew they had a big watch party. Because it's Sunday, everyone is off work, so I think this probably the day there is the most people."

We have such, we have not many players, and now we have one Masters 1000 in singles, two Masters 1000 titles in doubles with Hugo Nys ‚Äî also one Grand Slam final for Hugo in the Australian Open two years ago ‚Äî and what we get to achieve for Monaco is unbelievable. I hope that we're making everyone proud of us, and I hope just to keep going." 19 in doubles and has been a career-high No. He won his biggest title at ATP Masters 1000 Rome that year and also was a finalist at the Australian Open in 2023. Romain Arneodo, a winner of two doubles titles this season, is ranked No. 45 in doubles after reaching a career-high No. Earlier this year at the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters in April, French-born Monegasque player Arneodo made history by winning the doubles title with Frenchman Manuel Guinard. "For Monaco it's absolutely extraordinary and we've never had a Monaco-born player in the Top 100 in singles," said de Massy. "We've had, as Valentin said at the end of his semi-final match ‚Äî and I really appreciated that he did that ‚Äî is to remind everyone that in tennis there's singles, but there's also doubles, and we have extraordinary double players. In Monaco we love playing Davis Cup because we love being a team, we love being all together and with Monaco Tennis Federation ‚Äî and Monaco tennis as a whole actually, whether it's the tournament, the federation, or the club ‚Äî is one big family." Half-brother and coach Benjamin Balleret instilled the belief in Valentin that he would break into the Top 100 and then take it to a higher level. "When we were putting goals for Val it was not only Top 100, because it seems a little, like, 'Oh, for some guys, we just want to be Top 100'," said Balleret, who ranked a career-high No. So our role as the coach and all the team is to be behind him and to push him and to tell him that he believes that he can be a top-50 player. Because I think so many players stop believing."
