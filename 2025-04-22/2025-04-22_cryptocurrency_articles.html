                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Why XRP Is Not Dead Despite Current Price Action The crypto analyst further remarked that Ripple is building the rails, digitizing liquidity using XRP, mapping corridors, and “bleeding retail” so that only institutions, bots, and insiders are positioned. In line with this, he advised retail investors not to chase hype, or beg for dates, or flinch as the trick isn't timing when the switch flips for XRP. Simply put, 589Bull is confident that the altcoin will still experience a massive surge and is therefore advising market participants to hold and not get shaken out. 589Bull also answered the question on why XRP has the most fundamentals in its history and is still down 30% from its 2025 high. The analyst claimed that “they” are not trying to reward early holders but rather shake them out. He further stated that while retail investors are watching red candles, they are launching futures, likely alluding to the Teucrium XRP ETF, which just launched. 589Bull added that the institutions are also listing international ISINs, onboarding banks to DLT corridors, and filing ETF applications in the background. In an X post, crypto analyst CasiTrades stated that XRP's setup hasn't changed, but the clock is ticking. She explained that the altcoin remains in the same range, as there haven't been any new highs or lows. She added that the rejection came fast, and now the momentum is pulling XRP back to support. Meanwhile, CasiTrades also asserted that nothing about the bigger picture has changed. She stated that the current price action reinforces her belief that XRP will need to sweep major support levels, such as $1.90 and $1.55, before it is ready to break out. The analyst added that this should not continue to drag on as momentum in crypto shifts very quickly. Top website in the world when it comes to all things investing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New York, NY, April  22, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- XRP news is on everyone's radar after the token jumped 11%, rebounding from Monday's low of $1.65 to around $1.89. Meanwhile, newer projects like Remittix (RTX) are also capturing headlines, with fans pointing to real-world payment solutions that might shine in a market driven by both hype and practical use cases. XRP is currently trading around $1.89 rising over 5% in the past 24 hours. Several analysts see strong reasons for a potential breakout, fueling fresh XRP news across social media. Second, crypto commentator Dark Defender calls $1.88 a key support, believing XRP may bounce if whales stay net buyers. Third, the daily chart reveals two conflicting patterns: a head-and-shoulders that could sink the price to $1.30, and a triangle setup that might break bullish. Regardless of which pattern wins, XRP news remains lively because the altcoin stands at a pivotal price zone. Market watchers also warn that if the head-and-shoulders plays out, traders might see a steep correction soon. Still, broader XRP news points to leveraged ETFs, Grayscale's positive note, and whales holding strong. Combine all that, and you have a recipe for major swings—either up or down. Fans view it as a more agile version of Ripple's early ambitions—minus the multi-year legal headaches. If large partnerships or payroll integrations happen, some expect a strong bull run for this altcoin, possibly eclipsing the short-term upside in some well-known projects. Such an approach highlights the growing demand for cryptos that go beyond hype. By solving everyday remittance hurdles, Remittix (RTX) could capture a slice of the multi-trillion-dollar global payments market, drawing mainstream users who want less red tape and faster settlements. As more people look for dependable coins with lasting value, Remittix's real-world utility might set it apart in a crowded field. If a true parabolic run emerges, $2 and beyond could arrive faster than skeptics expect. Meanwhile, Remittix steadily gains traction, proving that real-world utility can stand alongside even the loudest crypto hype. As the market evolves, “payFi” solutions like Remittix (RTX) might capture a sizable user base, potentially outpacing major projects mired in legal or technological debates.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin bulls return as BTC price reclaims the $90,000 level, leading one analyst to predict an 80% gain “from here.” The US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded total net inflows of $381 million on April 21, levels not seen since Jan. 30. Rising spot BTC inflows, along with Bitcoin's increase in price, point to a possible resurgence in institutional demand for Bitcoin, and the change in trend from the ETFs could offset the selling pressure that has put a cap on BTC price for months. However, retail investor demand (buy volumes between $0 and 10,000) remained below 0%, which suggested that low volume buyers are not back yet. CryptoQuant community manager Maartunn highlighted that the present rally is leverage-driven rather than spot volume-driven. Glassnode data also pointed out that Bitcoin futures open interest (OI) increased by $2.4 billion in less than 36 hours. From a longer-term perspective, DYOR crypto founder Hitesh Malviya said BTC could gain 70% to 80% if it maintains a MVRV ratio of 2 for the next six weeks. Historically, an MVRV above 3.7 often signals overvaluation and market tops, while values near 2 have preceded strong price rallies. Bitcoin's MVRV score remained above 2 from October 2024 to February 2025, coinciding with its all-time high. Related: Bitcoin traders turn to $93K yearly open as BTC price hits 6-week high</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paul S. Atkins' appointment as SEC chairman signals potential regulatory clarity for crypto, which could reshape how U.S. businesses handle payments and financial operations. Crypto firms like Circle, Coinbase and Paxos are pursuing U.S. bank charters, aiming to operate within the traditional financial system under regulatory oversight. Atkins, who has long been personally involved with digital assets, is viewed favorably by industry advocates, who are hopeful he will use his position atop the regulatory body to drive forward regulatory clarity for the digital asset landscape. Separately, crypto companies like Paxos and Coinbase, as well as Circle, are pursuing bank charters, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday, essentially seeking to become part of the very banking system that has historically kept them at arm's length. For chief financial officers, treasurers and payment executives, these trends could affect how companies manage money in the coming years. Read also: The Digital Asset Primer: On-Chain Tokenization for Payments Professionals Participants might include banks, neobanks, payment service providers, FinTechs and digital wallet operators. By joining CPN, these institutions can send and receive payments globally in real time via stablecoins like USDC (a U.S. dollar-pegged coin) or EURC (a euro-pegged coin), which are redeemable 1-to-1 for fiat currency. One key aspect is that CPN itself doesn't move cash between bank accounts in the old-fashioned way. “Importantly, CPN does not move funds directly; rather, it serves as a marketplace of financial institutions and acts as a coordination protocol that orchestrates global money movement and the seamless exchange of information,” Circle's white paper said. CPN can essentially be viewed as an orchestration layer that tells participants how and when to transfer tokens (and the corresponding fiat on their balance sheets) to complete a transaction. For corporate finance teams, this could mean a richer array of financial services available on one interoperable network, rather than siloed portals and bank platforms. See also: 3 Things Payment Stakeholders Can All Agree On About Stablecoins Several crypto and FinTech firms are seeking U.S. bank charters or similar licenses right now. In 2023, after high-profile failures like FTX in the crypto industry and the collapse of crypto-friendly institutions like Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank, many traditional banks pulled back from serving crypto clients. If successful, a company like Circle could hold customer deposits, custody reserves for stablecoins, and make loans or offer other banking services, all under the supervision of bank regulators. By obtaining bank charters or trust licenses now, crypto companies could get ahead of impending regulations and shape them. They can potentially get direct access to Federal Reserve payment systems, hold customer dollar balances in central bank accounts, and operate across all 50 states without needing a patchwork of state licenses. For a stablecoin issuer like Circle or Paxos, being a nationally regulated bank could bolster trust among large institutions and users — essentially saying, “We meet the same standards as the bank where you hold your corporate treasury or your personal savings.” It's worth noting that not all these firms are pursuing the same type of charter. Circle and BitGo are reportedly aiming for full-service national bank charters. If these charters are approved, regulators will subject the firms to bank-like scrutiny. But if that provider is now a supervised bank entity (subject to audits, capital requirements and oversight by federal regulators), it changes the equation. Ultimately, the takeaway for business leaders is to stay informed and be prepared. We're always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

According to Justin Sun, founder of TRON, the digital yuan represents a significant innovation in the cryptocurrency landscape. His endorsement suggests potential shifts in trading dynamics as China continues to integrate its central bank digital currency (CBDC) into the economy. Traders should monitor developments in the digital yuan's adoption, as it may influence both regional and global cryptocurrency markets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gold hit a new high on Tuesday and bitcoin broke through the $90,000 threshold as anxiety over the US dollar's strength sent investors looking for other safe havens. With President Donald Trump's tariff policies throwing markets into turmoil, traditional and emerging alternatives — most notably gold and bitcoin — have rapidly gained favor. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold surpassed $3,500 per troy ounce to reach a new record before retreating to around $3,426 just before noon ET as Wall Street rebounded from Monday's sell-off. “Orders from central banks and retail investors are driving a historic surge in gold,” analysts at JPMorgan noted, adding they expect gold to average $3,675 per ounce by the fourth quarter and potentially hit $4,000 by mid-2026. ETFs rebounded above their 50-day moving averages, boosted by $381.3 million in total inflows on Monday. President Trump on Monday posted a social media message suggesting the Federal Reserve should act immediately to lower interest rates, despite recent signs of slowing inflation. Many interpreted the message as a not-so-veiled threat toward Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Rania Gule of XS.com pointed to growing global skepticism toward the dollar. The ICE US Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of major currencies, fell by over 1% on Monday, making dollar-denominated assets like gold more attractive to international buyers. Michael Brown, a market strategist at Pepperstone, echoed the sentiment. “Investors are reducing exposure to US assets amid policy instability. Stay up on the very latest with Evening Update. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. With traditional financial assets like US equities and Treasury bonds now under pressure, many are turning to bitcoin as a hedge. Physical gold ETF holdings are also at their highest level since 2023, and JPMorgan estimates central banks alone will purchase around 900 metric tons of bullion in 2025 after acquiring 1,045 tons in 2024 — accounting for roughly 20% of global demand. While a weaker dollar can benefit exports, the timing is problematic. “We're seeing capital flight from what were once the safest assets — US Treasuries and equities — at a moment when the economy may be tipping toward recession,” a senior economist told Investor's Business Daily. Compounding matters, the US posted a record $1.2 trillion trade deficit in 2024, while its net international investment position fell to -$26.2 trillion — figures Trump himself has criticized. “This kind of economic whiplash,” JPMorgan's analysts wrote, “is precisely what drives capital into alternatives like gold and bitcoin.”</p>

One of the buzziest terms in contemporary finance, cryptocurrency can feel incredibly difficult to understand. And why have so many people made memes about it? Some of these questions are easier to answer than others — especially when using an asset like ChatGPT, which is adept at synthesizing complex information into easy-to-understand terms. Which, for many laypeople, is exactly what they need to get a handle on crypto. And by many laypeople, I mean me — your humble personal finance writer. I started off with a very simple prompt: “Can you please explain crypto to me like I'm 12 years old?” And my pal ChatGPT came in the clutch, saying that it would explain it to me like we were friends at lunch. It even explained where the word “crypto” came from: “‘Crypto' comes from cryptography, which is a fancy word for super-secret codes. Cryptocurrencies use these codes to: keep your money safe, make sure no one can cheat or copy it, and let people trust it without needing a bank.” My buddy ChatGPT tells me that crypto lives on the blockchain, which is basically “…like a huge public notebook that everyone can see, but nobody can erase or cheat.” The blockchain keeps track of every transaction (as in who sent what to whom). “Every time someone sends crypto, it gets added as a new line in the notebook, and everyone agrees it's real,” said ChatGPT. “Crypto is decentralized, which means there's no boss, bank or government in charge. It runs on thousands of computers all over the world.” But what can I even get with it? I can buy stuff online, send money to a friend instantly (even if they're in another country), or hoard it like a dragon with their digital gold. You can even use it in online games or to buy digital art, like NFTs. With a stronger baseline understanding of what crypto is and how it works, I decided to ask ChatGPT a follow-up question: Where does it get its value? In fact, traditional money works the same way. Fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar aren't backed by gold or silver — they hold value because people agree they do, and trust that others will accept them in exchange for goods and services. ChatGPT explained further, elaborating on the supply-and-demand factor that Bitcoin's creators built into it as a way to increase its value: “If lots of people want a certain crypto (like Bitcoin), and there's only a limited amount, the price goes up. If only a few exist and everyone wants one, it becomes more valuable.” Usefulness is another factor, with some cryptos having value because they help run apps, enable smart contracts, or facilitate NFT purchases. “The more useful something is, the more people want it = more value,” ChatGPT said, adding that people's trust in the blockchain and overall hype for crypto have also played a role in giving it value. However, it's wise to also double — or even triple — check everything you learn from ChatGPT, and use it as a foundation for your own research.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Utility-driven projects are taking center stage in 2025, addressing blockchain's most pressing challenges—scalability, efficiency, and accessibility. Two standout projects, BlockDAG and Solaxy, are attracting significant investment with innovative solutions. BlockDAG is revolutionizing the mining model, while Solaxy offers a vital Layer 2 solution on Solana, tackling network congestion and reliability issues. As the crypto market sees a resurgence in investor interest, these new presale projects are gaining traction, with analysts recommending them as some of the best investment opportunities available. BlockDAG has already raised a staggering $215 million in its presale phase, signaling strong investor confidence. Through this system, users can mine cryptocurrency directly from their mobile phones, democratizing mining access and making it more environmentally friendly and widely available. The ability to participate in mining without the need for expensive rigs or technical expertise is one of its most compelling propositions. It's no surprise this model has garnered support from major blockchain advocates and investment communities alike. These crashes exposed critical limitations in Solana's current structure. With $31 million raised so far in its presale, Solaxy is already gaining traction and trust. The project allows users to buy, sell, and trade just like they would on Solana, but without the bottlenecks—delivering faster confirmation times, better scalability, and seamless interaction across dApps. Solaxy's architecture amplifies Solana's security while eliminating key drawbacks, making it a vital upgrade for the entire ecosystem. It serves both developers and users who want performance without compromise. One of Solaxy's most appealing features is its generous staking rewards program, offering 130% APY on presale allocations. Investors can start earning passive income immediately, as staking is live before the token's official launch. This presents a compelling value proposition for those looking to maximize early entry and enjoy strong returns with minimal friction. Accessing the presale is simple: users can purchase using USDT, USDC, ETH, or SOL, and even by credit card (Visa or Mastercard). The project has passed all necessary audits, adding another layer of credibility and security for new investors. BlockDAG is reshaping mining with mobile accessibility, while Solaxy addresses a key technical issue in one of the fastest-growing ecosystems. As both projects near launch, they present some of the most promising opportunities in crypto today. For those seeking long-term growth with strong fundamentals, BlockDAG and Solaxy are worth serious consideration. BlockDAG and Solaxy are gaining investment by solving blockchain issues, becoming top presale opportunities in the 2025 crypto market.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SHENZHEN, China, April 22, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- MicroCloud Hologram Inc. (NASDAQ: HOLO) ("HOLO" or the "Company"), a Hologram Digital Twins Technology provider, today announced that it developed an innovative solution aiming to provide an effective reconstruction for blockchain when it gets attacked. The solution employs verifiable secret sharing (VSS) technology to ensure that the blockchain system can quickly restore and maintain data integrity and consistency even under extreme circumstances. HOLO's blockchain reconstruction solution is based on the following components: VSS is a cryptographic technique that allows a private key to be split into multiple shares and distributed to different participants. These shares are meaningless individually, and the original secret can only be reconstructed when a certain number of shares are pooled. VSS is used to protect private keys and ensure that users can recover their blockchain data even if some of the nodes are compromised. In order to improve the fault tolerance of the system, HOLO uses a redundant storage mechanism on distributed nodes. In this way, even if some nodes are damaged, other nodes can use the redundant information to help rebuild the lost data. Participant selection and verification are crucial in blockchain systems. By dynamically selecting participants and verifying them rigorously, it is ensured that only trusted nodes can participate in the blockchain maintenance and data reconstruction process. Under this mechanism, users who honestly participate in reconstruction will be rewarded, while users who try to destroy or tamper with data will face severe punishment. In contrast to traditional reconstruction mechanisms, the scheme is able to take effect immediately, without waiting for negotiation and trust establishment between different blockchain parties. Each user can reconstruct their own data independently without relying on other untrustworthy participants. HOLO's innovative blockchain reconstruction solution provides a new kind of security for encrypted systems. With the continuous development and application of blockchain technology, this solution from HOLO will undoubtedly bring a far-reaching impact to the entire industry. MicroCloud Hologram also provides holographic digital twin technology services and has a proprietary holographic digital twin technology resource library.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Legacy tech – is holding finance back; nearly half of financial firms admit outdated infrastructure is stalling AI progress, with data quality and harmonization key to unlocking value. Blockchain and crypto – gain ground, with investments surging in both as financial firms eyeing new capital market opportunities – whilst also bracing for tougher digital asset regulation. So says a new report from financial services tech (fin-tech) supplier Broadridge Financial Solutions, which has polled 500-odd “leaders” among global wealth management, capital markets, and asset management firms, and found that almost half reckon their firms are not going fast enough with infrastructure upgrades (41 percent) and are impeded by legacy technologies (46 percent). Generative AI is all the rage, it finds – in finance, like everywhere else. Two-thirds (68 percent) think generative AI will have the “greatest impact on employee productivity” and a third (35 percent; considerably less) expect to see a return (ROI) on their investments / deployments “within six months”. Overall, firms expect to allocate 29 percent of their total IT spend to “technology innovation” over the next two years, up seven percentage points from last year's study. Almost half (47 percent) think DLT is enabling “new opportunities in the capital markets ecosystem”. Three quarters (73 percent) expect greater regulation and governance around digital assets going forward. Equally, almost three-in-five (58 percent) of firms say “data harmonization” is the clearest path (“ideal driver”) to accelerate and maximize ROI on AI-style initiatives. But Broadridge warns, as a pitch for business: “Today, when the introduction of a new AI model has the power to send shockwaves through financial markets, Bitcoin ETFs are routinely turning over billions in average daily volume, and cybersecurity has become a global mandate, financial services firms can no longer afford half-measures or indecision when it comes to data harmonization or addressing legacy technology.” Chris Perry, president at Broadridge, commented: “As financial services firms modernize their operations and move away from legacy systems, many are realizing that the right data management strategy has the power to break down silos and achieve the level of data quality needed to realize the potential of AI and sustain prolonged digital transformation within their organizations. Jason Birmingham, global head of engineering at Broadridge, said: “It's really all about straight-through processes and the ability to see consistent data across all products and workflows.</p>

Analog, a blockchain project looking to improve unified liquidity across multiple networks, said it raised $15 million through a token sale.

Digital asset financier Bolts Capital completed the token purchase to bring Analog's total backing to $36 million, according to an emailed announcement shared with CoinDesk on Tuesday.

Analog plans to use the capital to develop interoperability tools like Omnichain Analog Token Standard (OATS), which enables transfer of fungible and non-fungible assets across blockchains chains

Also in the pipeline is Firestarter, a real-world asset (RWA) marketplace to tokenize real estate, collectibles and revenue-producing items.

Tokenization of RWAs represents a use case for blockchain technology of considerable interest for traditional financial (TradFi) institutions. 

However, fragmented liquidity across multiple ecosystems is a potential roadblock to further adoption that interoperability projects like Analog are looking to demolish.

The primary driver behind Polygon's rise is Courtyard, a real-world asset (RWA) project that integrates NFTs. On April 22 alone, the project recorded $2.746 million in NFT sales. Courtyard sells physical trading cards, with each corresponding to an NFT on the Polygon network. These include rare baseball, basketball, and Pokémon cards, which Courtyard keeps in a vault. The project also features a virtual vending machine that gives users random cards to start collecting. This has prompted criticism among ETH holders, which believe that Ethereum is allowing layer-2 networks to capture too much value from the ecosystem.

Tivic Health Reports White House Briefing and FDA Meetings Secure... Ocean Biomedical Expands into Energy and Digital Asset Sectors to... The plan focuses on deploying capital across three key sectors: Solana (SOL) blockchain infrastructure, clean energy technologies, and critical minerals. The initiative is designed to utilize existing and future cash reserves to grow the company's treasury while maintaining its core focus on resource exploration and development. Snow Lake aims to create a balanced business model that combines traditional mining operations with investments in high-growth, tech-driven sectors. The company believes this diversification will enhance balance sheet strength and create long-term shareholder value while maintaining flexibility in evolving markets. Snow Lake Resources (NASDAQ: LITM) ha annunciato un nuovo Piano Strategico di Crescita volto a espandere il proprio portafoglio di investimenti oltre le risorse critiche. Il piano si concentra sull'impiego di capitale in tre settori chiave: l'infrastruttura blockchain di Solana (SOL), le tecnologie per l'energia pulita e i minerali critici. L'iniziativa è pensata per utilizzare le riserve di cassa attuali e future per far crescere la tesoreria dell'azienda, mantenendo al contempo il focus principale sull'esplorazione e lo sviluppo delle risorse. Snow Lake punta a creare un modello di business equilibrato che unisca le operazioni minerarie tradizionali con investimenti in settori tecnologici ad alta crescita. L'azienda ritiene che questa diversificazione rafforzerà il bilancio e genererà valore a lungo termine per gli azionisti, mantenendo la flessibilità in mercati in evoluzione. La compañía cree que esta diversificación fortalecerá el balance y generará valor a largo plazo para los accionistas, manteniendo la flexibilidad en mercados en evolución.

Snow Lake Resources (NASDAQ : LITM) a annoncé un nouveau Plan Stratégique de Croissance visant à étendre son portefeuille d'investissements au-delà des ressources critiques. Ce plan se concentre sur l'allocation de capitaux dans trois secteurs clés : l'infrastructure blockchain Solana (SOL), les technologies d'énergie propre et les minéraux critiques. Snow Lake vise à créer un modèle d'affaires équilibré combinant les opérations minières traditionnelles avec des investissements dans des secteurs technologiques à forte croissance. La stratégie met l'accent sur les investissements dans l'écosystème Solana, reconnu pour son efficacité énergétique, ainsi que dans des plateformes d'énergie propre alignées avec l'électrification mondiale et la demande énergétique pilotée par l'intelligence artificielle. L'entreprise estime que cette diversification renforcera la solidité du bilan et créera une valeur actionnariale à long terme tout en conservant une flexibilité dans des marchés en évolution. Snow Lake Resources (NASDAQ: LITM) hat einen neuen Strategischen Wachstumsplan angekündigt, der darauf abzielt, das Investitionsportfolio über kritische Ressourcen hinaus zu erweitern. Der Plan konzentriert sich darauf, Kapital in drei Schlüsselbereiche zu investieren: die Solana (SOL) Blockchain-Infrastruktur, Technologien für saubere Energie und kritische Mineralien. Snow Lake strebt ein ausgewogenes Geschäftsmodell an, das traditionelle Bergbauaktivitäten mit Investitionen in wachstumsstarke, technologiegetriebene Sektoren verbindet. Die Strategie legt besonderen Wert auf Investitionen im Solana-Ökosystem, das für seine Energieeffizienz bekannt ist, sowie auf saubere Energieplattformen, die mit der globalen Elektrifizierung und der durch KI gesteuerten Energienachfrage in Einklang stehen. Das Unternehmen ist überzeugt, dass diese Diversifizierung die Bilanz stärkt und langfristigen Aktionärswert schafft, während gleichzeitig Flexibilität in sich wandelnden Märkten erhalten bleibt. Snow Lake's pivot to invest in Solana crypto and clean energy represents a major strategic shift with significant diversification risks for the small-cap miner. Snow Lake Resources is executing a dramatic strategic pivot for a $48 million critical minerals company, expanding beyond its traditional mining focus into cryptocurrency and clean energy investments. This Strategic Growth Plan represents a fundamental business model transformation that substantially alters the company's risk profile and investment thesis. This creates an unusual hybrid business model where traditional mining operations will coexist with exposure to digital assets. While framed as strengthening the balance sheet, this move introduces substantial market volatility risk that didn't previously exist. What's critically missing from this announcement is any specific allocation framework - there's no disclosure of how much capital will be directed toward these new initiatives or what percentage of assets might be invested in Solana versus clean energy technologies. The strategic rationale appears to acknowledge the long-cycle, capital-intensive nature of resource development by creating complementary investments that could potentially generate returns while waiting for mineral projects to mature. For a small-cap company with  resources, however, this diversification simultaneously creates potential focus risks when management attention gets divided across fundamentally different business sectors. Without concrete parameters around allocation sizes or investment guardrails, shareholders are left with substantial questions about how this transformation will actually manifest and what it means for the company's core resource business. Solana is positioned as a high-throughput, energy-efficient blockchain that processes transactions more efficiently than older platforms like Bitcoin or Ethereum's original implementation. The strategic connection between a resource company and blockchain infrastructure appears tenuous at first glance, but there are potential synergies around energy usage and critical minerals required for technology deployment. Each approach carries dramatically different risk profiles, technical requirements, and regulatory considerations. For shareholders who invested based on critical minerals exposure, this fundamentally changes what they're getting in their investment without providing specific parameters around implementation or risk management. Winnipeg, Manitoba--(Newsfile Corp. - April 22, 2025) - Snow Lake Resources Ltd. (NASDAQ: LITM), d/b/a Snow Lake Energy ("Snow Lake" or the "Company"), announces a strategic growth initiative (the "Strategic Growth Plan") to allow the Company to utilize existing and future cash on hand to grow the Company's treasury and accelerate its long-term vision in critical resources.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin (BTC), popped up above $88,000 during the Asian session on Tuesday, tagging an intraday peak of $88,877. This inflow surge underscores Bitcoin's role as a hedge during times of uncertainty in global markets, especially now with the US dollar (USD) sliding against major currencies. US President Donald Trump's hostile gestures towards the Federal Reserve (Fed) shook the US dollar (USD), triggering a sharp drop on Monday as Trump criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates. At the time of writing, the meme coin exchanges hands at $1.06 after completing a cup and handle pattern's 66% breakout target, highlighted in previous analyses. Fartcoin holds above the 50, 100 and 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) indicators on the 12-hour chart, signaling a strong bullish outlook toward the next target at $1.20, a resistance level tested in December and January. However, entry into the overbought region introduces another risk of a potential pullback, especially if investors take profit. Declines below this level could cause a sharp price drop to the recent support level at $0.90 before extending the leg to $0.80 and $0.72. The upward-pointing RSI indicator at 63.52 suggests strong bullish momentum and that POL may continue to move higher in the coming sessions and days. DeepBook's launch on Sui Network on April 16 continues to positively impact the performance of DEEP, which tagged $0.1991, its highest level since mid-February. If investors liquidate for profit, sell-side pressure could claw back the accrued gains. Token launches influence demand and adoption among market participants. This is typically bullish for a digital asset. A hack is an event in which an attacker captures a large volume of the asset from a DeFi bridge or hot wallet of an exchange or any other crypto platform via exploits, bugs or other methods. Such events often involve an en masse panic triggering a sell-off in the affected assets. If the US Dollar index declines, risk assets and associated leverage for trading gets cheaper, in turn driving crypto prices higher.

Chainlink exchange outflows exceed $120 million in the last 30 days, hinting at increasing accumulation. The breakout from a falling wedge technical pattern and an uptrending RSI indicator signal stronger bullish momentum. Bitcoin is extending its gains, trading above $88,000 at the time of writing on Tuesday after rising nearly 3% the previous day. Institutional demand seems to be supporting BTC's recent price rally, with US spot ETFs recording an inflow of $381.40 million on Monday. Investors in select altcoins like Fartcoin, POL and DeepBook welcome double-digit gains. Bitcoin inches closer to $90,000, potentially waking up as digital Gold amid uncertainty in the macro environment. Validators must lock up 10,000 HYPE for one year, whether in the active set or not. Bitcoin price consolidates above $84,000 on Friday, a short-term support that has gained significance this week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While UPI is good, with the complete roll-out of CBDC, customers will at least have a choice, said RBI's Deputy Governor T Rabi Sankar. Sankar was speaking at Bharat Inclusion Summit 2.0 by IIMA Ventures in Bengaluru. “I have so far not seen any use case which potentially can solve the problem of cross border money transfer, only CBDC has the ability to solve it,” he said. CBDC is currently undergoing many alterations both in terms of technology and models, which is aimed at gradually improving its efficiency in users. A key area where digital payments have shown promise is in global retail payments, which are currently slow — up to a week and costly up to 6% for small transactions, Sankar noted. Traditional banking systems and legal frameworks limit cost reduction in these processes, he said. However, CBDCs can bridge this gap by offering immediate settlement without intermediaries, as they are both digital and a direct form of currency—allowing seamless, borderless transactions. Central bank money was trusted and easy to use without intermediaries but had limitations like being physical and unsuitable for large or distant transactions. Commercial bank money solved these issues by being digital but required trust and intermediaries. Now, with the introduction of Central Bank Digital Currency, central bank money is becoming digital—combining the trust and simplicity of traditional cash with the convenience and reach of digital banking.</p>
