                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Putin reportedly conveyed the offer during a recent meeting with U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff in St. Petersburg. This could be the first formal indication from Putin since the full-scale war began in 2022 that Russia may consider scaling back its territorial demands. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, responding to the report, cast doubt on its accuracy. "A lot of fakes are being published now, including those published by respected publications, so one should only listen to primary sources," he told the Russian state-controlled media outlet RIA Novosti. Moscow has repeatedly demanded international recognition of the regions as Russian and that Ukrainian troops completely withdraw from them as part of any peace negotiations. Putin's message reportedly prompted Washington to propose a "peace settlement," elements of which have since been revealed in media reports, according to the FT. According to the Wall Street Journal, the U.S. proposal — presented in a confidential April 17 meeting in Paris — involves potentially recognizing Russia's annexation of Crimea and barring Ukraine from NATO membership. Ukraine has been asked to respond this week, with a follow-up meeting scheduled in London on April 23 involving delegations from Ukraine, the U.S., the U.K., and France. European officials cited by the FT expressed concern that Putin's offer is designed to push U.S. President Donald Trump toward accepting broader Kremlin demands. President Volodymyr Zelensky firmly rejected such conditions on April 22, reiterating that Ukraine will not recognize Russia's occupation of Crimea under any scenario. Witkoff, who conveyed Putin's position and is expected to visit Moscow this week, has drawn criticism for backing proposals perceived as aligning with Russian interests. Washington has signaled that if no progress is made in the coming days, it may abandon its ceasefire mediation efforts.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a Tuesday speech that the ongoing tariffs showdown against China is unsustainable and expects a “de-escalation” in the trade war between the world's two largest economies. But in a private speech in Washington for JPMorgan Chase, Bessent also cautioned that talks between the United States and China had yet to formally start. Trump has placed tariffs on several dozen countries, causing the stock market to stumble and interest rates to increase on U.S. debt as investors worry about slower economic growth and higher inflationary pressures. “I do say China is going to be a slog in terms of the negotiations,” Bessent said according to a transcript obtained by The Associated Press. The S&P 500 stock index rose after Bloomberg News initially reported Bessent's remarks. The Trump administration has met for talks with counterparts from Japan, India, South Korea, the European Union, Canada and Mexico, among other nations. But Trump has shown no public indications that he plans to pullback his baseline 10% tariff, even as he has insisted he's looking for other nations to cut their own import taxes and remove any non-tariff barriers that the administration says have hindered exports from the U.S. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Tuesday that Trump told her “we're doing very well” regarding a “potential trade deal with China.” Leavitt said the Trump administration has received 18 proposals from other countries for trade deals with the U.S., adding that “everyone involved wants to see a trade deal happen.” Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bill Owens says in staff memo ‘it has become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it' In a staff memo obtained by the New York Times, Owens said that “over the past months, it has become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it, to make independent decisions based on what was right for 60 Minutes, right for the audience”. He continued: “So, having defended this show – and what we stand for – from every angle, over time with everything I could, I am stepping aside so the show can move forward.” It has to continue, just not with me as the executive producer.” Trump said in his lawsuit that CBS News engaged in “partisan and unlawful acts of election and voter interference” by editing its 7 October interview with Harris. CBS has denied the claim, saying Trump's lawsuit was an attempt by government officials to “punish” journalism institutions for their editorial decisions. Lawyers for Paramount Global, CBS's parent company, and Trump are currently engaged in settlement talks over his $20bn lawsuit. Last month, he accused CNN and MSNBC of being the “political arms” of the Democratic party, suggesting their actions should be deemed illegal and subject to investigation. Government-employed journalists at Voice of America (VoA), which broadcasts news, information and cultural programming in nearly 50 languages to a global audience, were put on leave after Trump signed an order eliminating the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), VoA's parent company. Instead, members of the White House press pool are now selected by administration officials. Additionally, Trump's social media platform Truth Social is currently embroiled in a defamation lawsuit against 20 news outlets that reported an erroneous earnings figure. CBS did not respond to an immediate request for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Analysis finds that corporations facing federal investigations or enforcement lawsuits donated a combined $50 million. In the new analysis, the watchdog group Public Citizen cross-references FEC data released Sunday with its own Corporate Enforcement Tracker, which documents companies facing federal cases for alleged wrongdoing. Public Citizen found that corporations facing federal investigations or enforcement lawsuits donated a combined $50 million to President Donald Trump's inaugural committee. Trump raised a record sum of $239 million for his second inauguration, the new FEC filings show. “Corporations facing federal lawsuits and investigations aren't giving millions to Trump's inauguration out of the kindness of their hearts,” said Public Citizen researcher Rick Claypool. Bank of America, Capital One, Coinbase, DuPont, and JPMorgan are among the corporations that donated to Trump's inauguration and subsequently had federal enforcement cases dismissed. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google's parent company, was among a number of high-profile corporate executives who were given prominent spots at Trump's inauguration ceremony in January. Other inauguration donors have benefited differently from the Trump administration's actions. Amazon, Google's YouTube, and Facebook parent company Meta sponsored “various stations at the event,” according to CBS. “Nothing says Happy Easter in Trump 2.0 like having corporate sponsors at the White House Egg Roll,” Public Citizen said Monday. “They really never miss an opportunity for some good old-fashioned corporate bribery.” We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency. Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.” Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Disability advocates urge funding education and services for autistic people — not surveillance-style data collection. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is collecting sensitive medical records from federal and commercial sources for Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new “autism research” initiative, which will give external researchers access to “comprehensive” patient data, representing “broad coverage” of the U.S. population. Kennedy, a longtime promoter of disinformation about autism, has been condemned for his ableism by disability rights advocates. In a recent press conference, Kennedy responded to new CDC data indicating an increase in autism diagnoses by declaring autism a “preventable disease” and an “epidemic”— claims unsupported by medical consensus. Nevertheless, he has pledged to identify the “cause” of autism by September. “But changes in prevalence should not drive how or what we study to find the causes of autism.” The CDC itself has stated that the rise in autism diagnoses is largely due to improved screening and awareness — directly contradicting Kennedy's claims that there is an autism “epidemic.” Lisa Settles, director of Tulane University's Center for Autism and Related Disorders, added in an interview with CNN, “To me, it's very obvious that [Kennedy] doesn't know a lot about the diagnosis,” she said. At the conference, Kennedy claimed that: “These are kids who will never pay taxes. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.” This is clearly untrue — many autistic people do engage in these activities, and those who don't can still lead full, happy lives with the right support, advocates emphasize. Notably, Kennedy has proposed that families of autistic people are “injured” and should receive financial compensation — despite receiving pushback from families who say that they are “outraged and disturbed” by his ableist comments. Disability organizations have firmly pushed back on RFK's ableist and inaccurate claims about autism. COVID-19, which has killed over 7 million people globally, continues to affect millions through long COVID, with symptoms ranging from fatigue and brain fog to chronic pain and mental health conditions. Disability advocates argue that rather than investing in surveillance-style data collection or reviving long-debunked theories, the federal government should be focusing on supporting the needs of autistic people. This includes funding home care, accessible education, and individualized services.​ However, the Trump administration has stalled disability rights cases, moved to cut health care funding, and is attempting to dismantle disability protections in public schools. “Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could help the country take a step forward if he listened to families, caregivers, health care providers, and scientists who actually understand autism and are doing the work to identify its cause or causes. He could help the country move forward if he insisted that HHS invest in home care and individualized supports for people with disabilities” said Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-New Hampshire) in a statement “[Instead,] Secretary Kennedy is using a position of great power to continue to exploit the vulnerabilities of millions of Americans, all for the purpose of spreading his own unfounded and fully debunked beliefs.” We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency. Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is collecting the private medical records of many Americans from several different federal and commercial databases to give to researchers for US health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr's new autism study. With this information being included in the database, the NIH is also reportedly crafting a new registry to track those with autism, per CBS News. The health agency claims it was doing so to fulfill a controversial promise the secretary of health made to root out the cause of autism by September, despite some experts saying that Kennedy's goal is not even feasible. “If you just ask me, as a scientist, is it possible to get the answer that quickly? I don't see any possible way,” Dr Peter Marks said on CBS's Face the Nation earlier this month. On the collection of data, the director of NIH, Jay Bhattacharya, told advisers during a presentation on Monday that the aim was to help researchers study autism by giving them access to “comprehensive” patient data and health records. He added that these records would cover a “broad range” of people across the US. “What we're proposing is a transformative real-world data initiative, which aims to provide a robust and secure computational data platform for chronic disease and autism research,” he said. Bhattacharya echoed Kennedy's words that some answers as to the cause of autism would be discovered by September, but he added that the study would be “an evolving process”. The news followed Kennedy's first press conference in which he claimed that a significant and recent rise in autism diagnoses was evidence of an “epidemic” caused by an “environmental toxin” despite the evidence collected by health researchers.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The IMF said that the global economy would grow just 2.8 percent this year, down from its forecast in January of 3.3 percent, according to its latest World Economic Outlook. US economic growth will come in at just 1.8 percent this year, down sharply from its previous forecast of 2.7 percent and a full percentage point below its expansion last year. The forecasts are largely in line with many private-sector economists' expectations, though some do fear a recession is increasingly likely. Economists at JPMorgan Chase & Co say the chances of a US recession are now 60 percent. The US Federal Reserve has also forecast that growth will weaken this year, to 1.7 percent. “We are entering a new era,” IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said. “This global economic system that has operated for the last eighty years is being reset.” Companies may pull back on investment and expansion as they wait to see how the trade policies play out, which can slow growth. China is also forecast to grow more slowly because of US tariffs. The IMF now expects it will expand 4 percent this year and next, down roughly half a point from its previous forecasts. While the US economy will likely suffer a “supply shock,” similar to what hampered during the COVID-19 pandemic and which pushed up inflation in 2021 and 2022, Gourinchas said, China is expected to experience reduced demand as US purchases of its exports fall. Japan's growth forecast has been marked down to 0.6 percent this year and next, 0.5 percentage points and 0.2 percentage points lower than in January, respectively. Taiwan will prioritize the development of silicon photonics by taking advantage of its strength in the semiconductor industry to build another shield to protect the local economy, National Development Council (NDC) Minister Paul Liu (劉鏡清) said yesterday. While Taiwan will further strengthen its existing shields, over the longer term, the country is determined to focus on such potential segments as Innolux activated a stringent supply chain management mechanism, as it did during the COVID-19 pandemic, to ensure optimal inventory levels for customers                                        Flat-panel display makers AUO Corp (友達) and Innolux Corp (群創) yesterday said that about 12 to 20 percent of their display business is at risk of potential US tariffs and that they would relocate production or shipment destinations to mitigate the levies' effects. US tariffs would have a direct impact of US$200 million on AUO's revenue, company chairman Paul Peng (彭雙浪) told reporters on the sidelines of the Touch Taiwan trade show in Taipei yesterday. That would make up about 12 percent of the company's overall revenue.

Chizuko Kimura insisted that the new star is still down While China's leaders use their economic and political might to fight US President Donald Trump's trade war “to the end,” its army of social media soldiers are embarking on a more humorous campaign online. Trump's tariff blitz has seen Washington and Beijing impose eye-watering duties on imports from the other, fanning a standoff between the economic superpowers that has sparked global recession fears and sent markets into a tailspin.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crimean Tatars are the indigenous people of Crimea, a Ukrainian peninsula that has been under Russian occupation since 2014. Chubarov's statement comes amid reports that the recognition of Crimea as Russian territory is being considered as part of a U.S.-backed proposal to end the war in Ukraine. Any move by the U.S. to recognize the peninsula as Russian would mark a break with a decade of bipartisan consensus in Washington and would violate international law. Chubarov said the Mejlis' stance is grounded in international law and aligns fully with Ukrainian legislation. Russia illegally annexed Crimea following a sham referendum held under military occupation and without international observers. Crimean Tatars are represented by the Mejlis, a high representative and executive body with 33 members, and the Kurultai, a national congress with 350 delegates. Since 2014, Moscow has used intimidation, religious profiling, and politically motivated terrorism charges to suppress dissent among Crimean Tatars. Many Crimean Tatars have joined Ukraine's Armed Forces since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, with some serving in the volunteer "Crimea" Battalion formed after the 2014 occupation. Ukraine's response to the U.S. proposal is expected at a follow-up meeting in London on April 23. Washington has indicated it may withdraw from ceasefire efforts in the coming days if no progress is made. Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of Ukraine's parliamentary foreign affairs committee, warned that recognizing Russia's annexation of Crimea would have global consequences "much worse than Munich in 1938."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It is a procedure steeped in tradition, but one which has been subtly updated for the modern world. It typically takes between two and three weeks for a pope to be chosen, though it can stretch slightly beyond that if cardinals struggle to agree on a candidate. Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who was born in Ireland and who became a naturalized American citizen after spending many years ministering in the United States, holds the position of “camerlengo,” or chamberlain. The apartment was not used by Francis, who lived in Casa Santa Marta. Here's what you need to know about the coming days and weeks. Francis, who was 88, died of a stroke and heart failure at Casa Santa Marta, his residence in the Vatican, on Monday. Cardinals must now decide exactly when the funeral can take place, and after that, when conclave can begin. Related article Pope Francis, voice for the poor who transformed the Catholic Church, dies on Easter Monday In the interim, the pope will be placed in a coffin, after which he will lie in state for several days until the funeral. Pope Francis' body could lie in state in St. Peter's Basilica for people to come and pay their respects as soon as Wednesday, a Vatican spokesperson said Monday. Mourners lined up for miles to see the body of Pope John Paul II, the last serving pontiff to die, in 2005. It is likely that unofficial events will take place in tandem in Buenos Aires, where Francis lived before becoming the Bishop of Rome. In Warsaw, more than 200,000 gathered at the site where John Paul II, then Karol Wojtyla, returned as the new pope in 1979. Then, at the end of the period of mourning, a large funeral Mass will take place at St. Peter's. This is historically a huge event, with dignitaries expected from around the world. John Paul II's funeral was attended by then-President George W. Bush and his two predecessors, Bill Clinton and George H.W. Francis declared his wish to be buried in a “simple” tomb in the ground at Rome's Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, a significant Catholic church and papal basilica. He had arranged for an unnamed benefactor to cover the expenses of his burial, according to his will released by the Vatican. But it's worth remembering that in 1996, John Paul II set the maximum number of cardinals allowed to participate at 120. Conclave is not expected to begin earlier than 15 days, nor later than 20 days, after the pope's death – though it could get underway sooner if all the cardinal electors arrive in Rome quickly. Inside the Sistine Chapel, the codified home of conclave, paper ballots are passed out to each cardinal, who writes the name of their chosen candidate below the words “Eligo in Summum Pontificem” (Latin for “I elect as supreme pontiff”). Technically, any Roman Catholic male can be elected pope. But the last pope not chosen from the College of Cardinals was Urban VI in 1379. When they're done, each cardinal - in order of seniority - walks to the altar to ceremoniously place his folded ballot into a chalice. The fifth day is set aside to break for prayer and discussion, and then voting can continue for an additional seven rounds. After that, there's another break and the pattern resumes. News cameras will have their lenses fixed on a chimney on a Vatican rooftop for days - because that's where the first confirmation of a new pope will be seen. If a pope hasn't been elected, the ballots will be burned along with a chemical that makes the smoke black. If white smoke billows from the chimney, however, it means “sede vacante” (in Latin “with the chair vacant”) is over and a new pontiff has been chosen – which could happen up to 13 days after the start of conclave. His papal name will be announced, and the new pope will then speak briefly and say a prayer. The last two popes have been inaugurated in St. Peter's Square. Francis' election was seen as something of a surprise; the first non-European leader in centuries, whose approach to many social issues was less strict than that of his predecessors. Though he did not radically alter Catholic practices, Francis surprised global observers with comments on homosexuality and the death penalty that were far more accepting than Benedict XVI. Whether the cardinals choose to continue down that path, or revert towards a hardline interpreter of biblical teachings, will be one question that hangs over the election. The consuming abuse scandal is another. In 2013, a group representing survivors of sexual abuse by priests named a “Dirty Dozen” list of cardinals it said would be the worst candidates for pope based on their handling of child sex abuse claims or their public comments about the cases. All but one have aged out of eligibility or died, but undoubtedly the track record of the next pontiff when it comes to responding to and dealing with allegations of abuse will be pored over.

MOSCOW, April 22. /TASS/ Kiev has markedly bolstered its deployment of FPV drone units along the Pokrovsk frontline within the special military operation zone, amid setbacks in the Kursk Region. Despite intensified Ukrainian drone assaults, Russian forces continue their advance on this sector, military expert Vitaly Kiselev said.

"There have been no significant changes on the Pokrovsk frontline. Considering the recent developments in the Kursk area, where Ukrainian forces suffered heavy personnel losses, they have now transferred a substantial number of FPV drones to Pokrovsk. Nonetheless, our troops are still making gains under these challenging conditions," Kiselev stated during an interview on Solovyov Live.

Ukraine's large-scale incursion into the Kursk Region commenced on August 6, 2024. According to Russia's General Staff as of March 12, more than 86% of the territory occupied by Ukrainian forces has been liberated. In some sectors, Russian units have crossed into the Sumy region. The Russian Defense Ministry reports that Ukrainian forces have suffered the loss of over 74,000 personnel since the hostilities began in the Kursk area.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian hockey star and Washington Capitals captain Alexander Ovechkin has passed compatriot Yevgeny Malkin for most power play goals scored by a Russian in NHL playoff history. On Monday night, in Game 1 of the Capitals' opening round playoff series against the Montreal Canadiens, Ovechkin scored on the power play with one minute to go in the first period. Ovechkin now has 29 power play goals in his playoff career, breaking a tie with Malkin en route to claiming another goals record, this time among Russians in the playoffs. Overall, he is now tied with Canada's Mario Lemieux for seventh all-time in playoff power play goals, while American Brett Hull holds the record with 38. And in the playoffs, especially, it doesn't matter who scores." "I think everybody was hitting today," the official NHL website quoted Ovechkin as saying. "<…> All our guys get involved in the physical game." Capitals' forward and assistant captain Tom Wilson heaped praise on Ovechkin after his Game 1 heroics: "He's a beast. "When he's out there creating energy for our team, scoring, he does it all. That's what a leader does," Wilson added. During the 2024/2025 NHL regular season, Ovechkin appeared in 65 games, tallying 44 goals and 29 assists. Despite missing 16 games earlier in the year with a fractured leg, he finished the season tied for third-most goals in the NHL with Buffalo Sabres' forward Tage Thompson. On April 6, Ovechkin scored his 895th career regular season goal in a game against the New York Islanders, passing legend Wayne Gretzky for most all-time (894 goals). In 2008, 2012 and 2014, "Ovie," as he is called by his fans, won gold medals at the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) World Championships to go along with his two silver and four bronze medals at the world championships.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Department of Justice (DOJ) on April 21 announced that 27 alleged members or affiliates of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua (TdA) had been charged under legislation designed to bring down criminal enterprises. The indictments were filed against those suspected to be current members of TdA, which is designated a terrorist organization by the federal government, and members of “Anti-Tren,” a group the DOJ said is largely composed of past TdA members. The case fits into President Donald Trump's broader hardline stance against gangs like TdA and MS-13. Attorney General Pam Bondi also released a statement on the indictment, saying, “Tren de Aragua is not just a street gang—it is a highly structured terrorist organization that has destroyed American families with brutal violence, engaged in human trafficking, and spread deadly drugs through our communities.” To convict under RICO, prosecutors must prove that one or more “enterprises”—meaning any organization dedicated to an end goal, whether corporate or criminal—engaged in a pattern of criminal behavior. Specific federal charges are eligible for prosecution under RICO, and any RICO case must involve at least two of those charges being committed within a 10-year period. RICO is an indictment even hardened criminals have come to fear, as its specific mechanisms allow prosecutors to charge far more liberally, and with far harsher prison sentences, than in many other types of criminal proceedings. Xavier Donaldson, an attorney representing one of the defendants, declined to comment. Joshua Kirshner, who is representing defendant Luis Jose Velasquez-Hurtado, told The Epoch Times in an email that his client will be pleading not guilty. “We are confident that after a thorough investigation, Mr. Velasquez-Hurtado will be fully exonerated,” Kirshner said. Other lawyers listed on the court docket for defendants did not return inquiries. Venezuela's socialist regime, which currently detains several dissidents recognized internationally as political prisoners, claimed that deported Venezuelan gang members detained at CECOT were themselves political prisoners. On April 20, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele proposed a swap of all Venezuelans currently in Salvadoran custody in exchange for an identical number of Venezuela's anti-regime political prisoners.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's Note: This report contains graphic descriptions of sexual acts.﻿ Former NFL star tight end Shannon Sharpe has been accused of multiple instances of assault, sexual assault, battery and sexual battery in a lawsuit filed Sunday by an anonymous woman and her attorneys. Sharpe's legal representatives called the lawsuit an attempt to “shake down” the popular podcaster for millions of dollars and said he “categorically denies all allegations of coercion or misconduct.” The civil complaint alleges Sharpe, 56, “violently sexually assaulted and anally raped Plaintiff,” in October 2024 and again in January of this year in Las Vegas, Nevada, “blatantly ignoring her requests for him to stop.” When asked if Jane Doe had contacted police during or after the alleged assaults, the plaintiffs' attorney, Tony Buzbee, said he could not comment. The attorney told CNN, “It takes a great deal of courage to stand up against those with power, fame and money. I look forward to pressing this case in court.” Davis said Sharpe “looks forward to vindication through due process and a judgment based on the facts and the law.” The complaint is seeking compensatory and punitive damages of more than $50 million. Sharpe won two Super Bowls with Denver and then another while a member of the Baltimore Ravens.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Police arrested a 30-year-old person inside Trump Tower on Monday after getting a report of a disorderly person on an “elevated surface” inside the building, authorities said. New York City Police responded at around 4:30 p.m. to the skyscraper where President Donald Trump keeps a penthouse. The tower also houses private condominiums, restaurants, shops, and a soaring public atrium that is open to tourists. Independent journalists on the scene posted video of security officials evacuating people from the atrium and police officers later exiting the building. The officers were wearing helmets and safety harnesses of the kind used by emergency responders who specialize in rescuing people from high places. The NYPD's emergency service unit took the person into custody without further incident, police said. It wasn't immediately clear what charges the person might face and the incident remains under investigation, police said. A person tried to scale the building in 2016 and got to the 21st floor before officers dragged him in.
