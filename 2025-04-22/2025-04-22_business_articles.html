                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"For the last 50 years, American children have increasingly been living in a toxic soup of synthetic chemicals," FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a press conference. Food and beverage companies use additives like red dye 40 to give cereal, chips, sports drinks and other products bright hues that attract shoppers. But backlash against artificial colorants has been brewing in the U.S. for more than a decade. The changes will affect a slew of food giants, including PepsiCo, General Mills, Mars and WK Kellogg. As of Tuesday, the FDA and the food industry don't have a formal agreement to remove artificial dyes but instead "an understanding," according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It is unclear what enforcement actions the agency would take if food and beverage companies do not comply. "There are a number of tools at our disposal," Makary said. "I believe in love, let's start in a friendly way and see if we can do this without any statutory or regulatory changes, but we are exploring every tool in the toolbox to make sure this gets done very quickly. And they want to do it — so why go down a complicated road with Congress?" The agency is also initiating a process to revoke authorization of synthetic food colorings, including those not in production, within the coming weeks. For companies currently combining petroleum-based yellow chemical and red dyes together, try carrot juice," he said. "The F in FDA stands for food," he said. "Now, there's no one ingredient that accounts for the child chronic disease epidemic. And let's be honest, taking petroleum-based food dyes out of the food supply is not a silver bullet that will instantly make America's children healthy, but it is one important step." Last month, Kennedy told top food executives that removing artificial dyes from the food system is an urgent priority of the Trump administration. Meeting attendees included the CEOs of PepsiCo North America, Kraft Heinz, General Mills, Tyson Foods, WK Kellogg, J.M. Kennedy has used Kellogg's Froot Loops as his primary example when railing against artificial colorants. While it is unclear exactly how removing dyes could affect the companies' businesses, it will be a major effort to overhaul recipes — and the new looks could affect how consumers perceive the products. Makary said phasing out petroleum-based food dyes won't increase food prices, pointing to other countries that have made similar moves. However, synthetic dyes are generally more cost-effective than natural alternatives, which often require larger quantities to achieve vibrant colors and can carry higher production costs, according to some reports and one natural ingredient manufacturer. Previously, pushback from consumer advocates led some of the companies to tweak their formulas and drop artificial dyes without any government intervention. In 2017, General Mills reversed course, putting its artificially colored Trix cereal back on shelves. The naturally dyed cereal, which used turmeric, radishes and purple carrots, was not as vibrant, and customers rejected the new version. In March, he announced plans to slash 10,000 full-time employees across different departments and consolidate divisions. He has cut back crucial parts of HHS, including offices that handle HIV prevention efforts and work to eliminate health-care disparities. The Food and Drug Administration is also suspending a quality control program for testing fluid milk and other dairy products due to reduced capacity in its food safety and nutrition division, Reuters reported on Tuesday. Kennedy's so-called Make America Healthy Again platform argues a corrupt alliance of drug and food companies and the federal health agencies that regulate them are making Americans less healthy. He has pledged to end the chronic disease epidemic in children and adults, and has been vocal about making nutritious food, rather than drugs, central to that goal. In January, before President Donald Trump or Kennedy took office, the Food and Drug Administration revoked its authorization of one type of red food dye called Red No. The dye is known to cause cancer in laboratory animals, but food manufacturers were allowed to use it for years because scientists didn't believe it raised the risk of cancer in humans at the level it is typically consumed. At least one company is benefitting from the ban on artificial dyes: McCormick, which helps companies tweak their flavors and formulas. "Now, reformulation activity has always been a part of the work that we do with our customer base, and we've been doing that for quite some time, but we are seeing a tick up in reformulation activity," McCormick CEO Brendan Foley told analysts on the company's earnings call in late March, adding that companies are seeking help cutting both artificial colors and sodium from their products.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told investors in a closed-door meeting Tuesday he expects "there will be a de-escalation" in President Donald Trump's trade war with China in the "very near future," a person in the room told CNBC. "No one thinks the current status quo is sustainable" with tariff rates at their current levels, Bessent said at a private investor summit in Washington, D.C., hosted by JPMorgan Chase. Stocks, already recovering from the prior day's sell-off, soared higher after Bessent's remarks were first reported. "We have an embargo now, on both sides, right?" Bessent also insisted that, despite the U.S. ratcheting up tariffs on Chinese imports to 145% and China retaliating with 125% duties on American goods, the goal of Trump's policy "isn't to decouple." Cabinet secretary noted that negotiating with China is likely to be "a slog." But neither side "thinks the status quo is sustainable," Bessent added. Later Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt echoed Bessent's positive outlook toward talks with China, though neither official suggested that those negotiations have actually begun. Leavitt said in a press briefing that Trump wants people to know that "we're doing very well in respect to a potential trade deal with China." Asked if Trump has spoken directly with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Leavitt said she had nothing to share. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The broad public and investors have something in common these days: They don't have a lot of love for either Tesla or CEO Elon Musk. Tesla's stock has undergone a withering sell-off, and the CNBC All-America Economic survey finds more than 47% of the public have a negative view of the company. That compares with a third of the public who have a positive view of General Motors with 51% neutral and 10% negative. Tesla has been under pressure with concern that its founder's controversial political activities in cutting government employment and backing President Donald Trump and Republicans could be alienating prospective buyers. Protests have sprung up across the nation at Tesla offices. The survey found Musk to be a highly polarizing figure. Half of the public has a negative view of Musk, compared with 36% who see him positively and 16% who are neutral. Among Democrats, Musk's net approval (positive minus negative) is -82 and -49 for independents. The biggest problem for Tesla may be that many groups who are potential customers are far more positive about electric vehicles than they are about the company. "Where Tesla is strongest is among the people least likely to buy an EV," said Micah Roberts, partner at Public Opinion Strategies, the Republican pollster for the survey. Men, however, are +11 in net approval of EVs but evenly divided on Tesla. The gap is most stark among Democrats, who are +20 on EV's but -74 on Tesla. Further complicating the issue: Republicans are strongly positive on Tesla, but net negative on EV's. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This was CNBC's live blog covering European markets. The construction sector closed around 0.7% lower, as household goods rose 1.7%. Global sentiment was buoyed on hopes of an eventual breakthrough in the trade standoff between the U.S. and China, sending U.S. stocks sharply higher. Traders are keeping an eye on news and comment out of the IMF-World Bank Spring meetings in Washington this week, where the threat and fallout from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs regime is likely to dominate discussions. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde told CNBC's Sara Eisen that there was "scope for negotiations" between Europe and the U.S. during Trump's 90-day pause on his full tariff policy, set to otherwise leave the European Union with a blanket rate of 25%. — CNBC's Alex Harring contributed to this market summary European stock markets closed higher on Tuesday, with the regional Stoxx 600 index gaining 0.25%. "It's clear that we need to reinforce and step-up our support to Europe's security and defense capabilities," the European Investment Bank president said. "Last year in 2024 we started to get ready and expand our mandate, and this year we have expanded it further so that we will ingrain security and defense as one of our core objectives in all our projects." Calviño added: "We will certainly increase our financing in this area. We doubled our investments last year, we are expecting to more than double in 2025 again and make a difference in terms of the security and strategic autonomy of Europe in these troubling times." Many European nations this year held bilateral talks at which they pledged to increase their defense spending, partly in response to fears over the future of U.S. support under Trump for Ukraine and institutions such as NATO. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde told CNBC that the disinflation process in the euro zone was "so much on track that we are nearing completion." U.S. tariffs dampen economic growth and will likely be a "negative shock to demand," she said. Lagarde said the ECB was not factoring a euro area recession into its forecast because the bloc had already begun an economic recovery and had a large internal trading network that it was planning to strengthen, while also expanding its relationships with other partners. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde told CNBC during an interview at the IMF Spring Meetings that Europe and the U.S. had scope to negotiate on tariffs. However, Lagarde said she disagreed with Trump's past comments that the EU treats the U.S. unfairly on trade, noting that trade between the two "vast" economies was complex and spanned services and foreign direct investment as well as goods. "There might be sectors where serious negotiations need to be had ... it's not just on one side, it's on both sides," Lagarde said. Lagarde also said that the shock from Trump's tariffs, along with renewed momentum for defense spending in Germany and beyond, had spurred a move toward long-discussed structural reform in Europe. "Europe is now saying, 'OK, now it's time, and it's Europe's hour to actually do the things that have to be done.' European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said she hopes the prospect of U.S. President Donald Trump firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is not on the table. Asked by CNBC's Sara Eisen on the sidelines of the IMF World Bank Spring Meetings, Lagarde said she would not comment on the potential market implications of an event she hoped was not a risk. It comes as Trump has been ramping up pressure on Powell to reduce interest rates, warning the U.S. economy could slow down otherwise. The IMF is projecting U.S. growth of 1.8% in 2025, down 0.9 percentage points from its January forecast. For the U.K., it sees annual growth of 1.1%, down by 0.5 percentage points. U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday morning, recovering some of their Monday losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 400 points, or 1%. The Trump administration last week ordered to halt construction activity on Equinor's Empire Wind offshore wind project off New York after the company had secured permits and approvals. Analysts suggest that investors are expecting other projects to be at risk of facing similar action. Denmark's Orsted is currently building the 704 megawatt Revolution Wind and 924 megawatt Sunrise Wind projects in the United States and could be exposed to U.S. President Donald Trump's actions against the renewable energy industry. "This immediately changes the rules of the game, as already approved projects are being halted, and it could potentially be very costly for Ørsted," Jacob Pedersen, head of equity research at Sydbank, said in a note to clients, according to an automated translation. Such action, Pedersen said, is a "nightmare for the offshore wind industry in the US if already approved projects can be derailed and stopped." Geopolitics could drive gold prices above a record $4,000 per ounce in the next 12 months, according to JPMorgan's commodity research team. "Tariff-driven recession and stagflation risks are forecasted to continue to supercharge gold's structural bull run," said Gregory Shearer, JPMorgan's head of base and precious metals research. The Wall Street bank said demand for the yellow metal from global central banks and investors, enabled by ETFs, is likely to be at "elevated levels" due to concerns over the global economy. Shearer's team said that gold was the "most optimal hedge" for investors concerned about a "unique combination of stagflation, recession, debasement and US policy risks" this year and next. London's FTSE 100 bucked the regional trend on Tuesday, trading 0.4% higher by 11:00 a.m. U.K. time. It put the index on course for its seventh consecutive day of gains and its biggest winning streak in two years. The biggest gainers in London included pest control firm Rentokil, British grocery giant Sainsbury's and sportswear retailer JD Sports. Stockholm-listed shares of Swedish biotech firm Biotage jumped 56.1% by 10:25 a.m. in London, after private equity giant KKR made a $1.2 billion bid to take over the company. In a statement on Tuesday, KKR said it had made a cash offer to Biotage shareholders of 145 Swedish krona ($15.24) per share. Biotage's Board of Directors has recommended that shareholders accept the offer. KKR is currently Biotage's biggest shareholder, holding 17% of outstanding shares through Gamma Biosciences, which it owns and operates. Other shareholders include Vanguard, BlackRock and Norges Bank Investment Management, which controls Norway's $1.8 trillion sovereign wealth fund. Novo Nordisk and Zealand Pharma, both down by around 8.4%, tumbled to the bottom of the Stoxx 600 index after U.S. rival Eli Lilly posted positive results from a late-stage trial of its oral weight loss drug orforglipron. Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche on Tuesday said that it would invest $50 billion in the U.S. over the next five years, amid concerns about the impact of possible new White House tariffs on pharma goods from abroad. Shares of Roche were 1.2% lower at 8:43 a.m. in London. The U.S. dollar has been on a largely downward trajectory since U.S. President Donald Trump's so-called liberation day tariffs sparked widespread market volatility earlier this month, even after the levies were paused for 90 days for most countries. Uncertainty about U.S. policymaking has led to a flight out of the U.S. dollar and Treasurys in recent weeks, with the dollar index weakening more than 9% so far this year. According to Bank of America's most recent Global Fund Manager Survey, a net 61% of participants anticipate a decline in the dollar's value over the next 12 months — the most pessimistic outlook of major investors in almost 20 years. European markets are expected to open from the long Easter weekend on a positive note, expected to open higher across the board. There are no major earnings or data releases from Europe Tuesday but traders will be keeping an eye on news and comment out of the IMF-World Bank Spring meetings in Washington this week, where the threat and fallout from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs regime is likely to dominate discussions.

Apple Inc.'s new Siri engineering chief is overhauling the management team leading development of the beleaguered voice assistant, taking a step he assured employees would set the company up for success.

Mike Rockwell, head of engineering for the assistant, is replacing much of Siri's leadership with lieutenants from his Vision Pro software group, according to people with knowledge of the matter. He's also restructuring teams related to speech, understanding, performance and user experience, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the changes are private.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde on Tuesday said she hoped that U.S. President Donald Trump firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was not a scenario that was on the table. Asked by CNBC's Sara Eisen whether Trump finding a way to remove the central bank chief was a material risk to markets, Lagarde said: "I certainly hope not ... I hope that it is not a risk." Trump appointed Powell during his first presidential mandate, but is now looking into whether the Fed chief can legally be sacked before his term expires. Trump has been ramping up pressure on Powell to reduce interest rates, warning the U.S. economy could slow down otherwise. Powell in turn last week suggested that Trump's trade war could weigh on growth and fuel inflation. He did not indicate his expectations for the interest rate path ahead, but noted that "for the time being, we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance." Lagarde told CNBC on Tuesday: "We're both used to political pressure in one way or the other." "I have immense respect for the work that he does, and for his loyalty to his job and to being as diligent, disciplined as possible to deliver on his mandate. The euro area's central bank has consistently cut rates as inflation closes in on its 2% target and economic growth in the bloc appears lackluster. The Fed has meanwhile been keeping rates steady this year, after enacting three consecutive reductions between September and December last year. The ECB last week cut interest rates by a further 25 basis points, making its third reduction of 2025 and its seventh trim since it began easing monetary policy last summer. In its monetary policy statement, the central bank warned of a weakened growth outlook linked to the global trade uncertainty stoked by Trump's tariff policy. Trump has cited ECB rate cuts during his recent attacks on Powell. On Monday, he posted on his Truth Social platform that the central bank had already cut rates seven times, and again branded Powell "Mr. Too Late." The EU could be slapped with universal 25% tariffs without a deal. "I am sure that there is scope for negotiations. "I would be surprised if there was not such a thing," she added. The EU has currently paused its first tranche of counter-tariffs, a response to the rates on metals, while it engages in talks. Lagarde said she disagreed with Trump's view that the EU treats the U.S. unfairly on trade because of its goods surplus, noting that the relationship also spanned services and foreign direct investment. "There is so much joint interest" between the U.S. and Europe, she said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

The International Monetary Fund sharply lowered its forecasts for world growth this year and next, warning the outlook could deteriorate further as US President Donald Trump's tariffs spark a global trade war.

The downgrades add weight to similar warnings from several Wall Street banks in recent weeks, with JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. saying the chances of a recession in the US have spiked.</p>

Tesla Inc. investors reeling from one of the stock's worst-ever quarters are once again looking for Elon Musk to inject excitement back into the company when it reports results Tuesday, as profits slip and the much-awaited debut of a self-driving car remains months away.

This year is off to a dismal start as Musk's political entanglements have pushed Tesla's sales to a nearly three-year low in the first three months, leading a slew of Wall Street analysts to slash their growth expectations. The automaker's souring outlook and towering valuation has spooked investors, leading to a 53% plunge in Tesla's stock price since it hit a record in December.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Every family has some drama, and Meta's has been coming to light through the release of court documents in recent days. Facebook's $1 billion 2012 acquisition of Instagram plays a large role in the FTC's case. From Zuckerberg's POV, Facebook was driving Instagram's growth at the cost of engagement and its own relevance, and it was time for Instagram to return the favor. It was clearly a tricky situation for Zuckerberg to navigate. Several documents from 2018 show a recurring topic of concern: Instagram overshadowing Facebook. "The Facebook app has historically driven most of Instagram's growth through bookmarks and other links, and has born a higher ad load tax," Zuckerberg said in a letter to board members in 2018. In May 2018, Zuckerberg wrote to several Facebook executives in an email that "one of the major mistakes I regret is not reducing the massive inorganic distribution to Instagram sooner." "If we had stopped aggressively promoting Instagram at 500 million people, for example it would have had sufficient scale to build and compete on Stories and we would not have the same concern about network fragmentation that we have today," he said. "All of our metrics suggests that Instagram is a good but overall less effective product, and is likely only growing so quickly because we promoted it heavily," Zuckerberg said. Facebook, meanwhile, needed to maintain relevance among its users as Instagram grew. "When you get an Amazon Echo and start using it after you already use Amazon for commerce, you feel like Amazon is getting more relevant in your life," Zuckerberg said in the May 2018 email to executives. "However, when you get Instagram and start using that in addition to Facebook you feel like Facebook as a company is getting less relevant in your life." Zuckerberg saw two options for improving Facebook's relevance at the time: double down on Facebook's branding when users opened Instagram and WhatsApp, or change the corporate brand entirely. Then, in 2021, Facebook changed its corporate name to Meta Platforms. Fast forward to 2022, and Facebook's relevance in users' lives was still a struggle. "Right now IG is doing well on cultural relevance and FB isn't, so I'm more focused on figuring out a reasonable path for FB longer term," Zuckerberg said in an email to head of Facebook Tom Alison. Throughout 2018, Zuckerberg discussed several options that could help preserve Facebook's cultural relevance and growth amid Instagram's "cannibalization." Here are a few that were discussed in the court documents: Zuckerberg's May 2018 email to executives reveals concerns around retaining Systrom and Kreiger at Facebook. "Within our current discussion framework where we have to tread very carefully when discussing any possible downsides of promoting Instagram, I'm not sure how we'll even articulate the decisions I'm suggesting here to Kevin," Zuckerberg said. Later in the email, Zuckerberg describes Systrom as "an excellent product leader who has built something massively successful" and a "good team player." "But by the very fact of him pushing so hard for what he believes is right and our desire to retain him, we compromise more than we would for almost any other leader, and over time those compromises compound to creating a large imbalance in the value flows between the apps," Zuckerberg said. A few months later, Mosseri and Zuckerberg also discussed Systrom. "I caught up with Kevin briefly last night but it's hard for me to get a read on what's going on as the relationship is strained," Mosseri said in a June 2018 email to Zuckerberg about shifting Instagram's priorities. In August, Mosseri told Zuckerberg that Systrom and Krieger "seem to be struggling with all of this."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are so many AI research papers these days, it's hard to stand out. But one paper has fired up a lot of discussion across the tech industry in recent days. The authors identify two previous modern AI eras. The first was epitomized by AlphaGo, a Google AI model that famously learned to play the board game Go better than humans in 2015. Silver and Sutton say we're now entering a new period called "the Era of Experience." To me, this represents a new attempt by Google to tackle one of AI's most persistent problems — the scarcity of training data — while moving beyond a technological approach that OpenAI basically won. This method of reinforcement learning, or RL, produced Google's AlphaGo. The problem with this approach: Machines trained this way did well on specific problems with precisely defined rewards, but they couldn't tackle more general, open-ended problems with vague payoffs, Silver and Sutton wrote. The next area was kicked off by another Google research paper published in 2017. "Attention Is All You Need" proposed that AI models should be trained on mountains of human-created data from the internet. Just by allowing machines to pay "attention" to all this information, they would learn to behave like humans and perform as well as us on a wide variety of different tasks. The key to this era has been amassing as much high-quality, human-generated data as possible, and using that in massive, compute-intensive training runs to imbue AI models with an understanding of the world. While Google researchers kicked off this era of human data, most of those people left the company and started their own things. Many went to OpenAI and worked on technology that ultimately produced ChatGPT, which is by far the most successful generative AI product in history. Others went on to start Anthropic, another leading generative AI startup that runs Claude, a powerful chatbot and AI agent. Many experts in the AI industry, and some investors and analysts on Wall Street, think that Google may have dropped the ball here. Although it came up with this AI approach, OpenAI and ChatGPT have run away with most of the spoils so far. However, you can't help but think about this situation when the authors seem to be dissing the era of human data. "While human-centric RL has enabled an unprecedented breadth of behaviours, it has also imposed a new ceiling on the agent's performance: agents cannot go beyond existing human knowledge." Silver and Sutton are right about one aspect of this. The supply of high-quality human data has been outstripped by the insatiable demand from AI labs and Big Tech companies that need fresh content to train new models and move their abilities forward. As I wrote last year, it has become a lot harder and more expensive to make big leaps at the AI frontier. They suggest that models and agents should just get out there and create their own new data through interactions with the real world. This will solve the nagging data-supply problem, they argue, while helping the field attain AGI, or artificial general intelligence, a technical holy grail where machines outperform humans in most useful activities. "This paradigm shift, accompanied by algorithmic advancements in RL, will unlock in many domains new capabilities that surpass those possessed by any human." Any modern parent can think of this as the equivalent of telling their child to get off the couch, stop looking at their phone, and go outside and play with their friends. "Papers like this are emblematic of the confidence found in the AI industry," he wrote in his newsletter on Monday, citing "the gumption to give these agents sufficient independence and latitude that they can interact with the world and generate their own data." Just like you might nag your partner to exercise more by saying they'll get stronger and look better if they go to the gym.) An educational assistant could use exam results to provide an incentive or reward, based on a grounded reward for a user's language learning. Except this time, AI models and agents are learning from the real world and collecting their own data, rather than existing in a video game or other digital realm. The key is that, unlike the Era of Human Data, there may be no limit to the information that can be generated and gathered for this new phase of AI development. In our current human data period, something was lost, the authors argue: an agent's ability to self-discover its own knowledge. "Without this grounding, an agent, no matter how sophisticated, will become an echo chamber of existing human knowledge," Silver and Sutton wrote, in a possible final dis to OpenAI.</p>
