                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told investors Tuesday that the US-China trade war is unsustainable and he expects the battle to de-escalate, a person familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN, giving a boost to a Wall Street rally that had taken shape this morning. The Dow closed higher by 1,017 points, or 2.66%. Stocks extended their gains midday after Bessent told investors at a closed-door event hosted by JPMorgan Chase that he expects de-escalation in the trade spat with China. The event was first reported by Bloomberg. According to one person in the room, Bessent said that he expects both sides will de-escalate in the very near future because China and the United States effectively have embargoes on each other due to extremely high tariffs. The Nasdaq and Dow snapped a four-day losing streak. Despite the rebound, the S&P 500 is on track for its worst month since 2022 and the Dow is on track for its worst April since 1936, according to FactSet data. Investors have been on edge as uncertainty lingers about trade negotiations and Trump has ratcheted up his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Stocks gave back some of their gains in the afternoon before closing higher as White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that she had spoken with President Donald Trump and Director of the National Economic Council Kevin Hassett about the Federal Reserve, and both expressed doubt about the Fed's decisions on interest rates — reigniting concerns that the White House might try to undermine the Fed's independence. Stocks were coming off a day sharply in the red as investors assessed Trump's continued tirade against Powell for not cutting interest rates — a complaint he has levied multiple times. “A multi-front trade war is by itself a lot for stocks to handle so adding a Fed independence crisis on top of it has markets understandably jittery,” said Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, in a Monday note. While many experts say the president does not in fact have the power to fire the Fed chief just due to policy differences, Trump has made clear he's willing to break with norms and precedent. Mohit Kumar, chief economist and strategist for Europe at Jefferies, said in a Tuesday note that “it will be nearly impossible for Trump to remove Powell without cause” and it is unlikely Trump will have broader political support to oust Powell before his term ends in 2026. “Moreover, as recent events have shown, bond market is the pressure point for Trump,” Kumar said. “Any attempt to subjugate the Fed's independence will be met by a strong negative bond market reaction and Trump will need to back down.” Related article The bond market is acting weird. US stocks, government bonds and the dollar all sold off on Monday in a continuation of a trend that has unnerved Wall Street. Typically, when stocks sell off during moments of uncertainty, investors seek refuge in safe havens like Treasuries and the dollar. Yet that conventional wisdom has been breaking down this month during bouts of sell-offs in all three American asset classes. Trump's tariffs and countermeasures by America's trading partners will likely deal a heavy blow to economic growth worldwide, with US prosperity hit particularly hard, according to the International Monetary Fund. Global economic growth is expected to slow down to 2.8% this year, from 3.3% last year and significantly below the historical average, the IMF forecast in its World Economic Outlook on Tuesday. The slowdown expected in the United States is even steeper, with its economy likely to grow only 1.8%, compared with 2.8% in 2024. Wall Street this week will be on edge for potential signs of progress in trade talks but also focused on a slate of earnings results for the first quarter. Investors today will likely be attuned to Tesla's (TSLA) earnings results which are scheduled to be released after the closing bell. Elon Musk's electric vehicle company has cratered in market value this year as its stock has tumbled more than 40%. The index has been staunchly in “extreme fear” this month.

Mitch McConnell said Thursday that the former Republican leader will not run for re-election in 2026. FIRST ON FOX: Rep. Andy Barr, R-Ky., is officially entering the race to replace longtime retiring Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Barr, who has served in the House for over a decade, is expected to kick off his campaign in Richmond, Kentucky this evening. He's also releasing a video to launch the campaign that paints him as a staunch ally of President Donald Trump and a fierce opponent of "woke" trends on diversity, transgender inclusion, and U.S. energy dominance. Rep. Andy Barr is running for the Senate seat being vacated by longtime Sen. Mitch McConnell. But here in Kentucky, that's why we love him. His candidacy sets up a high-profile primary race against former Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron. In the video, Barr promised to "deport illegal aliens, instead of putting them up in luxury hotels," and "get rid of this anti-coal, do-gooder ESG garbage once and for all." "Working with President Trump, I'll fight to create jobs for hardworking Kentuckians, instead of warm and fuzzies for hardcore liberals," Barr said in the video. "And as a dad, let me be clear. I'll fight to lock up the sickos who allow biological men to share locker rooms with our daughters." Barr and McConnell have very different relationships with President Donald Trump. "There is no bigger supporter of President Donald J. Trump and our MAGA movement than my dear friend Andy Barr," Scalise told Fox News Digital. Stefanik said, "I am proud to call Andy a friend and I wholeheartedly endorse his campaign for US Senate. Kentucky needs a Senator who stands 100% with President Trump — that my friend, Andy Barr." Barr said their support "is a strong signal to all Kentuckians that there is only one America First candidate in this race — and only one candidate with a proven record of getting our America First agenda across the finish line." The conservative lawmaker has been known as a reliable leadership ally in the House and serves as chair of the House Financial Services Committee's subcommittee on financial institutions. His final years in office have been marked by his rocky relationship with Trump, who has called for an end to McConnell's political career on multiple occasions. McConnell opposed two major Trump nominees in the national security sphere, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Pentagon Secretary Pete Hegseth. Former Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron is also running for the Senate seat. McConnell also opposed Trump's Health and Human Services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Barr and Cameron's campaigns are a stark departure from that – both have painted themselves as staunch Trump allies. Kentucky businessman Nate Morris is also expected to announce a Republican bid for the seat. And in Kentucky, where Trump outran former Vice President Kamala Harris by roughly 30%, the president's endorsement will likely prove decisive. "The great Andy Barr re-brand is on as he now will try and convince Kentucky he's actually conservative and MAGA. Voters know he went Washington and sold out Kentucky long ago," Moody said.

We focus on being useful to you — breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Many of the justices seemed eager to impose impossible burdens on schools. Three years ago, Montgomery County, Maryland, approved several books with LGBTQ characters for use in public school classrooms. Not much else is known about these books, how they have been used, when they were used in lessons, or how teachers plan to use them in the future. These questions have come before lower courts, but the Supreme Court decided to hear a case — Mahmoud v. Taylor, brought by conservative Muslim and Christian parents who find these books objectionable — before these lower courts had a chance to sort out whether anyone's constitutional rights have actually been violated. Despite all this uncertainty, all six of the Supreme Court's Republicans appeared absolutely convinced, during an oral argument on Tuesday, that the Montgomery County school district violated the Constitution, and that it must do more to protect parents who object to these books on religious grounds. Based on Tuesday's argument in Mahmoud, it seems all but certain the Court will rule that parents who object to these books must be allowed to remove their children from any classes where the books are featured. What is less clear is whether the Court will do so in a way that could endanger every public school in the country's ability to function. Eric Baxter, the lawyer representing the parents who oppose these books, seemed quite emboldened during Tuesday's argument, and advocated for a result that would be extraordinarily disruptive. In his brief, Baxter suggested that parents who object to any form of classroom instruction on religious grounds must be notified in advance about that instruction and be permitted to opt their child out of the class. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed out, past cases involve parents who object to lessons touching on topics like divorce, interfaith couples, and “immodest dress.” Parents have brought federal lawsuits objecting, on religious grounds, to the government using unique numbers to identify people in its own internal records. They've objected to lessons exposing children to ideas about evolution, pacifism, magic, women achieving things outside of the home, and “false views of death” — among other things. Under Baxter's proposed rule, to avoid these lawsuits, school districts would have an obligation to notify parents in advance if they will teach any book where magic exists, any book where divorce exists, any book where women have accomplishments, or any book about famous pacifists such as Martin Luther King, Jr. — among many other things. It is hard to imagine how any public school could comply with such an obligation. Justice Samuel Alito, for example, suggested at one point that Baxter's rule might only apply to very young students, or to lessons that touch upon sexuality. Following Gorsuch's line of thinking to its conclusion would allow the Court to rule that Montgomery County's policies must be changed because they are rooted in animus, but that another school district might be allowed to enact similar policies so long as they did not display similar hostility toward religion. Broadly speaking, the justices floated four different approaches to this case. Kagan said she understood how even non-religious parents might object to “young kids” being taught “on matters concerning sexuality,” but she added that there wasn't anything in Baxter's argument that would allow the Court to limit claims by parents who want to micromanage a school's lessons. Similarly, Jackson was troubled that Baxter's arguments seemed so broad that they could prevent a gay teacher from displaying a picture of their own wedding, or even prevent a teacher from referring to a transgender child by that child's preferred pronouns in the presence of another student whose parents object to trans people on religious grounds. But these concerns were largely limited to the Court's Democratic minority. The most extreme of these six Republicans was Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who at one point said that he is “mystified, as a longtime resident” of Montgomery County, that this case exists. As the Supreme Court said in Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery (1988), the First Amendment only prohibits government action that tends “to coerce individuals into acting contrary to their religious beliefs.” But Kavanaugh at one point seemed to propose overruling Lyng and holding that a parent with religious objections to a lesson must only show a “burden” on their faith — however Kavanaugh would define that term. Both Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts, meanwhile, appeared to think that there is something particularly noxious about exposing young people to books with gay characters. Gorsuch, meanwhile, latched onto several lines in Baxter's brief, which claim that a school board member compared parents who object to LGBTQ-inclusive literature to “white supremacists” and “xenophobes.” This matters because, in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission (2018), the Court ruled in favor of a baker who refused to bake wedding cakes for same-sex couples because a state civil rights commissioner made similarly disparaging comments about the baker. So it is possible that the Court will hand down a good-for-this-ride-only decision that gives these specific Montgomery County parents the result they want, without harming public education elsewhere. It is also possible that the Court will impose a kind of “Don't Say Gay” rule on elementary school teachers, while allowing high school teachers to reveal that some people form romantic attachments to people of the same sex. One surprising omission in Tuesday's argument is that no one mentioned the Court's decision in Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District (1969), a free speech case brought by students who wore black armbands to class in order to protest the Vietnam War. In Tinker, the Court held that these students had a right to wear the black armbands, but it did so because the students merely engaged in a “silent, passive expression of opinion, unaccompanied by any disorder or disturbance on the part of petitioners.” Tinker held that public school students retain free speech rights, but not when their speech “materially disrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others.” The Court, in other words, recognized that public schools could not function if students could engage in speech that disrupts lessons, and it crafted a careful rule which respects those students' First Amendment rights without undercutting the school's ability to educate them and their classmates. Because the full facts of this case are not yet known, it may, in fact, turn out that a teacher tried to coerce a student into rejecting their religious beliefs, or otherwise behaved in a manner that violates the Constitution's protections for religious people. Based on Tuesday's argument, it is difficult to guess whether Kavanaugh's, Alito's, Gorsuch's, or some other approach will prevail. But, if the justices choose to accept Baxter's arguments in full, they could easily impose unworkable obligations on public schools that will prevent them from functioning. ﻿In an unusual overnight order, most of the justices voted to halt several illegal deportations.</p>

Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley discusses the legal battle over the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia on 'The Ingraham Angle.' Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch and Chief Justice John Roberts on Tuesday sided with left-leaning justices in an immigration appeals case, a narrow ruling that could portend the court's future thinking amid a flurry of legal cases centered on immigration. The 5-4 ruling in Monsalvo Velazquez v. Bondi centered on the government's interpretation of a 60-day "voluntary departure" deadline, which authorities can use to allow certain immigrants deemed to be of "good moral character" to depart the U.S. on their own terms within that timeframe. Neil Gorsuch testifies during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 22, 2017, in Washington, D.C. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Writing for the majority, Gorsuch noted that this interpretation of the 60-day period aligns with long-standing administrative practices, including in immigration law. "When Congress adopts a new law against the backdrop of a ‘long-standing administrative construction,' the Court generally presumes the new provision works in harmony with what came before," Gorsuch said. "Since at least the 1950s, immigration regulations have provided that when calculating deadlines, the term ‘day' carries its specialized meaning by excluding Sundays and legal holidays (and later Saturdays) if a deadline would otherwise fall on one of those days," Gorsuch added, noting that the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act passed by Congress uses the same reading. Gorsuch was joined in the majority decision by Roberts, and Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. And while the case in question centers largely on the technicalities of certain immigration proceedings, the slim majority ruling could offer early signs of the court's thinking as justices gear up for a flurry of high-profile immigration cases – including cases centered on due process protections for migrants, and on nationwide injunctions that block Trump's birthright citizenship ban from taking force. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh arrive for President Biden's 2024 State of the Union at the Capitol. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett dissented, noting that, in their view, the court lacked jurisdiction to weigh in on the matter. While Thomas said he would have remanded the case back to the lower circuit court to consider other outstanding issues, and Barrett took issue with the nature of the appeal filed by Monsalvo, Alito said in a separate dissenting opinion that he viewed the court's interpretation as a whole as incorrect. "There will always be a sympathetic pro se alien who is a day or two late," Alito said. "Unless the Court is willing to extend the statutory deadline indefinitely, it would presumably be forced to say in such cases that a day too late is just too bad." The narrow ruling comes just weeks before May 15, when justices are slated to hear oral arguments in a case challenging President Donald Trump's attempt to end birthright citizenship in the U.S. Breanne Deppisch is a national politics reporter for Fox News Digital covering the Trump administration, with a focus on the Justice Department, FBI, and other national news.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Actor Rainn Wilson challenged MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle's idea that a “concerted effort” is responsible for the nation's declining faith in legacy media. “Forty percent of Americans don't trust mainstream media. Why is that?” Wilson, best known for his portrayal of Dwight Schrute on The Office, asked Ruhle on the latest episode of the Soul Boom podcast. It's a huge problem because when you think about Democracy and all of these pillars, they need to stand tall. They need to stand strong, and, sort of, losing that trust is not by accident. According to Ruhle, Americans' lack of faith in mainstream media is the product of “concerted effort” by the Right and allies of President Donald Trump to “destroy” the news media because it is the last line of defense when it comes to holding power accountable. Ruhle has previously accused Trump of suppressing the media, and the Washington Examiner reported she showed support for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. “You have the Elon Musk media machine because they want you to leave traditional media, and they want you to go to X, which is a bastion of misinformation, where there is no fact-checking,” Ruhle told Wilson. “So, it's a perfect storm of people saying: ‘I'm angry. Ruhle said the media must respond by covering what is happening in politics and the White House, but Wilson jumped in, calling out the behavior of leftist media under the administration of former President Joe Biden. “This is where I would push back,” he said. “When I see this kind of insight and passion being directed at the current administration and the lack of this kind of insight and passion being directed at the previous administration, where, again, I'm not talking about you. Immigration is not a good example of hypocrisy, according to Ruhle. “I can specifically remember when [Republican Govs.] A large majority of the people who have a problem with the immigration crisis are not racist, but they are “tarred” as being racist by the liberal left and their outlets, according to Wilson. “So many people have come on this show … and said, ‘I don't watch the news anymore, and my life is so much better. I took Apple News off my phone. I don't even subscribe … and my life is so much better and richer for it,'” Wilson said. That idea, itself, is “rich,” Ruhle said. “People of privilege can afford to tune out.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Harvard University's lawsuit against the Trump administration has set up a titanic clash between America's most prestigious university and the federal government over academic freedom, federal funding and campus oversight. The case has been assigned to US District Court Judge Allison Burroughs, an Obama nominee who was involved in a previous landmark case involving the university. Burroughs, who did not earn her bachelor's or law degree from Harvard, upheld Harvard's admissions process in a 2019 ruling that was overturned by the Supreme Court's landmark decision ending race-conscious admissions in American colleges. In March, the federal government sent a letter to Harvard saying the school was being investigated for its failures to “curb or combat” antisemitism on campus. A similar letter with demands for policy changes had been sent to Columbia University, and federal agencies soon announced a review of more than $5 billion in grants to the Ivy League school. The White House continued targeting universities — Princeton, Cornell and Northwestern all had funds frozen or suspended — and on April 11 sent Harvard a list of policy changes it wanted implemented, demanding “immediate cooperation” if the university wanted to “maintain Harvard's financial relationship with the federal government.” Related article Analysis: The real stakes in Trump's confrontation with Harvard A New York Times report suggested the letter inadvertently had been sent prematurely. The Trump administration retaliated by freezing $2.2 billion in multiyear grants and contracts, making plans to rescind Harvard's tax-exempt status and threatening the school's ability to host international students. If the case were to end up at the Supreme Court, it would be heard by a bench that includes four Harvard alumni: liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, along with Justice Neil Gorsuch and Chief Justice John Roberts, both conservatives. Justices are unlikely to recuse themselves from a case based solely on having studied at an institution involved. Jackson recused herself from a case involving affirmative action at Harvard because she was on the school's board of overseers; the other three Harvard alumni ruled in that groundbreaking case. Billions of dollars, along with jobs, research and Harvard's ability to administer financial aid are not the only things at stake. Garber also signed a letter with more than 100 presidents of colleges, universities and scholarly societies, opposing the Trump administration's pressure on academic institutions.

The Trump administration intends to continue a dialogue with Harvard, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said Tuesday, insisting the White House's recent demands are not about curbing freedom of speech. “I made it very clear that these are not First Amendment infractions. This is making sure that students on all campuses can come and learn and be safe … and that is why we have had these funds either withheld or frozen during this period of time of negotiation,” she said on CNBC's “Squawk Box.” Related video ‘An unprecedented assault': Legal scholar says White House attacks on Harvard are threat to democracy McMahon did not respond directly to a question about whether the Trump administration's demand in its April 11 letter for “viewpoint diversity” among Harvard students, faculty and departments, to be audited by a third party, is really about free speech. We would like to have viewpoint diversity,” the education secretary replied. The letter, she added, “was intended to have both parties sit down again and continue their negotiations.” Harvard, the world's wealthiest university, has an endowment of $53 billion, which could help cushion cuts. About 80% of that money is earmarked for financial aid, scholarships, faculty chairs, academic programs or other projects, according to the school. But the lawsuit paints a bleak picture of that future if Harvard has to dip into university coffers for too long. Eventually, Harvard will be left operating at “a significantly reduced level,” the complaint says. The Trump administration's threats against Harvard's tax-exempt status and its ability to host international students could put even more pressure on the university's funding, and more federal money could get withheld. The National Institutes of Health announced Monday it would pull medical research funding from universities with diversity and inclusion programs. Harvard's many partnerships with other universities, private companies, and state and local agencies mean the freeze on funding will touch off widespread economic harm, the lawsuit argues, noting, “Harvard is one of Massachusetts' largest employers.” CNN's Shania Shelton, Brad Lendon, Matthew Rehbein, Andy Rose, Michelle Krupa, Kara Scannell and John Fritze contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At a time when critical funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency has slowed to a crawl, some states — with Republican governors — have been luckier than others in prying money loose. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has said she will “eliminate FEMA” altogether. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees FEMA, denied any special treatment for red states, saying “the Secretary reviews every grant based on need — not discrimination based on state.” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for Trump's National Security Council, told CNN: “The only criteria for critical relief is ensuring we deploy all available resources to those impacted in the most efficient way to help all Americans. The first directives to distribute funding came in March, when FEMA was sitting on a backlog of more than $100 billion of previously awarded grants and disaster assistance, as agency personnel awaited guidance from the Trump administration on how to distribute the money without violating the president's executive orders that funding not end up benefiting illegal immigrants. The Trump administration has vowed to cut some of those programs. FEMA staff first received orders to prioritize payments for Missouri, after state officials warned the Department of Homeland Security that they would have to lay off state emergency management personnel if the funds didn't arrive quickly, according to internal emails obtained by CNN. Homeland security officials forwarded Missouri's request to FEMA, and within 24 hours, the agency's acting administrator instructed staff to start paying the state. At the time, extremely little money was getting out of FEMA, multiple sources tell CNN. “Today, is there a way we can focus on payments to Missouri specifically and clear these out?” acting FEMA Administrator Cameron Hamilton, a Trump appointee, told agency personnel in an email, which CNN obtained. In the weeks that followed, Missouri began receiving various previously paused grants, even as other states were forced to wait for a range of FEMA funds – including, in some cases, disaster assistance – multiple sources tell CNN. The episode alarmed some FEMA officials who had never experienced such a wide-reaching funding pause at the agency, as other states and locales pushed for their own funding to be cleared. Multiple officials, speaking to CNN anonymously out of fear of retribution, said the money for Missouri was not assistance for any recent disaster and seemed no more urgent than the paused payments to other states. “But is the same thing going to happen if Gavin Newsom calls the White House and says, ‘Hey, we really need X, Y, Z? CNN reached out to Kehoe and Schmitt about the situation. Last week, another directive went out to FEMA staff: prioritize payments for Virginia. A DHS spokesperson would not clarify why Missouri and Virginia were singled out for priority but reiterated that grants are greenlit based solely on need. Glenn Youngkin's Communications Director Rob Damschen told CNN the governor “works closely with federal officials to ensure that Virginia communities receive critical disaster recovery support. Governor Youngkin sincerely appreciates the level of engagement by President Trump and his entire administration who are focused on delivering for Virginians.” Yet some inside FEMA argue the unfreezing of federal funding goes beyond leveraging working relationships. “This is politicization of grant funds and disaster assistance like we've never seen before,” a second FEMA official told CNN. FEMA payments have started flowing more freely in recent weeks, but the agency is still working through its backlog, which has proved consequential for some of the recipients. As FEMA greenlit some payments, North Carolina was waiting on more than $150 million in disaster assistance for its recovery from Hurricane Helene, according to the state's office of emergency management. North Carolina Emergency Management spokesman Justin Graney told CNN more than half of that backlog has now been cleared, but the ongoing delays have been detrimental to their recovery efforts as the state waits to be reimbursed by the federal government. As FEMA's previously awarded funds trickle out of the agency, the White House has also recently denied additional disaster relief to two states with Democratic leadership. Yet during the 2024 campaign, Trump repeatedly lambasted FEMA's response in North Carolina, saying the agency had failed to provide adequate resources to hurricane survivors. The administration also denied Washington state's request for $34 million in additional disaster assistance to help in its recovery from last year's “bomb cyclone,” which killed two people and destroyed homes and infrastructure, saying the funding “is not warranted.” “There are very clear criteria to qualify for these emergency relief funds. “This is another troubling example of the federal government withholding funding.” Ferguson, like Stein, has vowed to appeal the decision.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It took at least 12 New York animal cops in a four-hour “squirrel raid” to find and seize a pet squirrel and raccoon from an amateur sanctuary in a case that has drawn national scorn from Vice President JD Vance and tech giant Elon Musk. #fyp #fpy #fypp #viral #video #foryou #foryourpage #foryoupage #pet #pets #animal #squirrel #fun #funny #laugh #follow #us #instagram #insta #instago #instagood #tiktok Dubbed a “squirrel raid” by the Washington-based legal watchdog, the package of 163 pages secured under a Freedom of Information Law lawsuit described an operation of overwhelming force to find Instagram star Peanut and “Fred” the raccoon after officials received a few anonymous complaints. No rabies was found in the tests of Peanut or Fred. “New York State bureaucrats did not want to turn over these documents, but Judicial Watch's lawsuit forced their hand,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. “The documents show an abuse of power where 12 officers were sent in on a raid to seize Peanut and Fred, who the bureaucrats decided beforehand would be killed. Mark Longo had Peanut for seven years and featured the squirrel in social media posts used to raise money for his “sanctuary.” But a handful of people complained, and the state moved in. The officer who organized said at least 12 law enforcement personnel were involved: “3 DEC [Department of Environmental Conservation] investigators, 1 investigator lieutenant, 4 uniform ECOs [Environmental Control Officers], 1 uniform lieutenant, and 3 Bureau of Wildlife staff.” Longo has threatened to sue the state, and the case has sparked a consideration of “Peanut's Law” to require a 72-hour waiting period before animals from animal sanctuaries are euthanized, possibly long enough to observe symptoms of rabies. The case resulted in widespread online anger at New York officials. Vance expressed concern during a 2024 election rally, and Musk called the raid “government overreach.”</p>

Stewart Chiron, a Miami-based cruise industry expert known as "The Cruise Guy," tells Fox News Digital the reasons why cruise passengers are sailing now, more than any other time in history. While searching for new sea life, the Schmidt Ocean Institute announced it's discovered a colossal squid, according to The Associated Press (AP). The juvenile squid stretches about one foot in length at a depth of 1,968 feet. Once fully grown, adult colossal squids can reach lengths up to 23 feet or about the size of a small fire truck, the AP said. "It also has the largest eyes of any animal, larger even than those of the great whales." Oceana notes the species is "likely naturally rare." Kat Bolstad, Auckland University of Technology squid researcher, helped confirm the species. Once fully grown, adult colossal squids can reach lengths of up to 23 feet or about the size of a small fire truck. "I really love that we have seen a young colossal squid first. This animal is so beautiful," Bolstad said, according to AP. She added that researchers are testing different cameras in hopes of catching an adult colossal squid. Researchers catch a baby colossal squid on camera (not pictured) for the first time. When the squid ages, it will lose its glassy appearance and turn an opaque dark red or purple.

Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., tells 'The Will Cain Show' why he traveled to El Salvador after an alleged MS-13 gang member was deported by the Trump administration. The House GOP's elections arm is offering to foot the bill for any future Democratic lawmakers' trips to El Salvador after multiple progressive lawmakers traveled there in protest of the Trump administration's deportation policies. "If out-of-touch House Democrats are so desperate to cozy up to violent gang members, the least they can do is let Americans watch the show," NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella said. "We'll pay for the plane tickets, they just can't forget to smile for the camera while they sell out their constituents." Reps. Maxine Dexter, Robert Garcia and Maxwell A. Progressive Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., was in El Salvador last week, where he met with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an illegal immigrant married to an American citizen. The administration says Abrego Garcia is an MS-13 gang member with a violent history. Democrats, in contrast, have painted him as a Maryland father and husband wrongfully deported under the Trump administration's sweeping immigration plans. Four House Democrats – Reps. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., Robert Garcia, D-Calif., Yassamin Ansari, D-Ariz., and Maxine Dexter, D-Ore. – are currently in El Salvador with Abrego Garcia's family lawyer in an effort to secure his release. Frost told Fox News host Will Cain on Monday that they had not been able to meet with him. Rep. Richard Hudson is chair of the NRCC. It comes amid President Donald Trump's standoff with the courts over his administration's deportation of suspected Tren de Aragua and MS-13 gang members to El Salvador. Democrats and human rights groups argue that the White House is denying due process rights to deported individuals, while supporters say the illegal immigrants' hearings and deportation orders are sufficient evidence of due process. The court ordered the U.S. "to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador." Republicans, meanwhile, are eager to tie Democrats to suspected criminals being deported to an El Salvador prison – particularly after border security and immigration proved potent issues for the GOP in the 2024 elections. Illegal immigrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia has become a flashpoint in the political standoff. "Come witness Trump Derangement Syndrome in its purest form," the voiceover says.

Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on the Democratic Party's young challengers to older party voices on ‘Special Report.' The tract of political land where Democrats reside is unique. They still held the presidency then with President Bill Clinton. It's not the same zip code after the legendary House blowout in 2010 where they dropped an historic 63 seats. President Barack Obama remained in the White House. It's even a different electoral co-op for Democrats compared to 2016, when President Donald Trump unexpectedly prevailed over Hillary Clinton, winning in the Electoral College. Democrats controlled neither the House nor Senate in 2017. But a lack of support for Trump in Congress and his inexperience at governance undercut sizable portions of his legislative agenda. President Donald Trump and DNC vice chair David Hogg (AP/IMAGN) President Trump is back in the White House – this time after winning the popular vote and Electoral College, scoring a decisive knockout over former Vice President Kamala Harris. And the political real estate Democrats now occupy is a very foreign locale. But President Trump returned to power resoundingly and emboldened. So it's natural there's Democratic infighting about what went wrong, who deserves blame and, more importantly, what direction the party should take next. Younger, more progressive Democrats are trying to weed out senior lawmakers and power brokers who have been in office for years. Let's start with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. She's the best known of younger, energetic, left-leaning Democrats. Ocasio-Cortez arrived on the scene, upsetting former Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., in a 2018 primary. "We got them on their back foot. We've got them scared," said Ocasio-Cortez recently about MAGA-aligned Republicans. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in Los Angeles on April 12, 2025. Let's go win our young people back," thundered 25-year-old Democratic National Committee (DNC) Vice Chairman David Hogg. asked 26-year-old Kat Abughazaleh, the Democratic Illinois congressional candidate and TikTok influencer. Younger Democrats are trying to banish party veterans. "We' have to have a whole rebrand of the Democratic Party," said Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif. "New leaders. "What we're trying to do here is not just focus on primaries where there's potentially an older incumbent. But more than anything, an ineffective person in that position. And replace with a generational leader," said Hogg on MSNBC. But she first came to Congress in 1998. She's been a member of the House of Representatives longer than Abughazaleh has been alive. "You have to look to the exceptions for real leadership, as the majority work from an outdated playbook. "Beating the other side is more important to many voters [rather] than who exactly is representing your own team," said University of Mary Washington political scientist Stephen Farnsworth. David Hogg speaks during the state Democratic Party Convention in El Paso, Texas, on June 7, 2024. "What we're talking about here is a pretty powerful, generational clash within the Democratic Party over how to aggressively challenge President Trump," said Farnsworth. Some top political handicappers like Nate Silver now believe that Ocasio-Cortez could be the odds-on favorite to emerge as the Democrats' 2028 presidential nominee. "We're here together because of an extreme concentration of power, greed and corruption which is taking over this country like never before," Ocasio-Cortez declared during a whistlestop in Missoula, Montana. So Democrats are searching for a toe-hold against the president. But a Fox News voter analysis found a staggering 11-point spike in voters under age 30 favoring Trump in 2024 compared with 2020. "In the 2024 election, Democrats lost a lot of voters who had voted for Biden four years ago. Some of them went to Trump," said Farnsworth. "It seems to me that a more aggressive messaging strategy is certainly one way of connecting with voters who didn't feel as warmly toward the Democrats in 2024 as they did in 2020." Republicans found themselves at a loss in late 2012. Republicans held the House and finally flipped the Senate after they tried to get control dating back to 2006. Former President Barack Obama pauses as he speaks during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Aug. 20, 2024. Republicans also won the House in 2010 after Obama's big 2008 victory. In 2009, many Republicans felt it was best if the GOP took a couple of cycles to retrench their bench and agenda during the echoes of the presidency of George W. Bush. They viewed their victory as a repudiation of Obama and the policies of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. But, nonetheless, this was a strange piece of political landholdings to acquire for the GOP in 2010. We don't know what the political real estate market will look like in 2026. But Democrats now occupy a remote, unfamiliar province. Democrats are trying to map and navigate this alien territory. But the key with any piece of real estate is how you use it. Democrats are trying to determine if drifting further to the left helps them use this particular land tract. Does cultivating youth boost them at the polls? We'll know in November 2026 if Democrats successfully converted their property into something useful. Or if it's a total wreck and undesirable.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The GOP-led House Judiciary Committee is pressing Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis‘s staff for documents after she has spent months stonewalling a congressional investigation into the “politically motivated” prosecutions of President Donald Trump. In a series of letters sent last week, the panel reportedly asked several of the Democratic district attorney's senior staffers to provide testimony and hand over records related to her office's alleged coordination with the since-defunct House select Jan. 6 committee. The allegations revolve around a memo Willis wrote to the Jan. 6 committee's then-chairman, Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-MS), in which she requested access to transcripts, emails, and travel records. Members of her administration then allegedly traveled to Capitol Hill for a meeting with committee staff, in which they reviewed nonpublic material. One letter addressed to assistant prosecutor Donald Wakeford notes that the House Judiciary Committee has been asking him since Feb. 6 to appear before Congress for a transcribed interview, according to a copy of the correspondence obtained by Law and Crime. Wakeford previously requested a 30-day extension to obtain personal counsel and seek legal advice. As of March 31, he had retained an attorney, former Fulton County prosecutor Charlie Bailey, a Democrat who unsuccessfully ran for Georgia lieutenant governor in 2022. Wakeford, however, has still not complied with the committee's requests. Similar letters were sent Thursday afternoon to deputy district attorney Will Wooten, assistant chief investigator Michael Hill, and assistant chief investigator Trina Swanson-Lucas, according to FOX 5 Atlanta. According to Thursday's letters, the congressional committee received an email stating that Willis told the staff members that they were “not authorized to release any potentially responsive items to any outside party whatsoever” because all relevant records are the “exclusive property” of her office. The lawmakers also warned of escalating actions if they are met with more resistance. A whistleblower, whom Willis fired, alleged she misused DOJ grant money meant to finance the creation of a Center of Youth Empowerment and Gang Prevention and spent the taxpayer funds on unrelated, frivolous expenses. Willis and the committee's chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), have been engaged in a war of words over her noncompliance. At the state level, Willis is also fighting a subpoena from a special Georgia Senate committee that was formed to look into prosecutorial misconduct allegations against her. “This has been going on now for many months,” Republican state Sen. Bill Cowsert, who chairs the committee, said during a Senate hearing. GOP state Sen. Greg Dolezal accused Willis of “thumb[ing] her nose at this committee.” However, she has agreed to produce “certain already publicly produced documents” and “will do so at an appropriate time,” the attorney added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The level of spending cuts is a major point of contention as Republicans begin writing legislation to  extend the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and add new tax cuts proposed by President Donald Trump. Republicans aim to pass the major tax and spending bill through budget reconciliation, a legislative process that allows bills to bypass the filibuster and pass with only a simple majority in the Senate. Here's what to know about the spending cut goals in reconciliation. Republicans hold only a slim majority in the House. Some members favor major spending cuts to lower deficits and the federal debt. The cuts would come from individual committees that are tasked with writing legislation to spell out reductions in spending through specific programs: That all adds up to $1.5 trillion, a number that has gotten a lot of play in the media after House Speaker Mike Johnson was able to get the votes to pass the budget resolution. It is critical to note that $1.5 trillion in spending cuts would only partially offset the tax cuts sought by Republicans, not to mention any additional new spending programs that might be included in the final legislation, such as for border security. But, in the technical sense, there is no officially identified topline in the resolution identified as $1.5 trillion, according to Michael Thorning, director of BPC's Structural Democracy Project. They include floors of just $4 billion — billion, not trillion — in total spending cuts across four committees, compared the $1.5 trillion in the House. While there are deficit hawks in the Senate, there are also several Republican senators who might oppose significant spending reductions, such as reforms to Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income and disabled people. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) said that it's his conference's “ambition” to find $1.5 trillion in spending cuts. But he has acknowledged the challenges the Senate will face and has noted that some in his conference might see $1.5 trillion in cuts as too much. “We got folks on both sides of that issue. Similarly, the reconciliation instructions call for $880 billion in deficit reduction from the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicaid. While many conservative Republicans favor sweeping reforms to the program, centrists, such as Susan Collins (R-ME) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) have indicated opposition to overhauling Medicaid. “We cannot and will not support a final reconciliation bill that includes any reduction in Medicaid coverage for vulnerable populations,” the lawmakers said. Republicans do have options to reduce Medicaid spending in ways that they could argue do not reduce benefits for core, vulnerable recipients. For instance, one option is to boost work requirements. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, imposing federal work requirements for Medicaid would save the government approximately $140 billion over 10 years. Republicans have suggested the requirements would apply only to able-bodied adults without children. But the numbers show that getting sufficient spending reductions to offset tax cuts will be very difficult. But Roy said he “reluctantly voted” for the budget blueprint after Trump and congressional leadership promised “a minimum of $1 trillion in real reductions in mandatory spending” in reconciliation, according to the New York Times. Brendan Duke, senior director for federal fiscal policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-of-center think tank, pointed out that the floors are in place to comply with the budget resolution, but they could always change. Individual members of Congress deeply wanted those spending cuts.”And while the House has the technical ability to change that target, if they did so they could lose the votes of deficit hawks like Roy who would be upset if that level of cuts does not ultimately end up in the final fiscal overhaul legislation. Roy has said that Johnson had “made a specific commitment to guarantee the House framework tying tax cuts to spending cuts.” “So I think you've got some deficit hawks, for instance, who the price of their support is that $1.5 trillion number,” Thorning said. “Well at that point, the procedural part doesn't really matter.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The party has uniformly spoken in support of Abrego Garcia's right to due process after he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador last month. But some have expressed concern in recent days over how it has conveyed the nuances of their argument that a violation of one person's due process rights – regardless of their personal backstory or legal status – threatens everyone in the US. And as Democrats look to take back power in Washington, starting with next year's midterm elections, how that message is received by voters matters. Democrats who've urged a different approach say they worry that the party isn't doing enough to broaden the due process argument beyond Abrego Garcia's case. Others have argued it's a “distraction” from more politically salient messages on the economy that shifts the conversation to immigration, where Trump holds an advantage with voters. In an aggressive push to keep the issue alive and raise pressure on the administration, Democratic lawmakers – including Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen and a quartet of House progressives – recently traveled to El Salvador to visit Abrego Garcia, who has been held in Salvadoran prisons since his deportation last month, and pushed for his release. They join others who have rejected the counter argument from members of their own party, who say the due process argument comes with political risks. “We as Democrats should fight for due process not because it polls well, not because it's been focus grouped, but because fighting for due process is the right thing to do,” Rep. Ritchie Torres, a New York Democrat, said in an interview. Under legislation Torres introduced last month, the US government would be required to punish foreign countries if they don't return migrants who a court has ruled were improperly deported. At a press conference there, Frost said he was in El Salvador because he'd received “hundreds and hundreds of calls” and emails from his constituents. I represent a lot of people who see themselves represented in this situation,” Frost said later in an interview with Fox News on Monday. “They're saying, ‘Congressman, do what you can now because it's him today, and it can be one of us tomorrow. Republicans have been quick to frame Democrats' defense of Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Salvadoran national and Maryland resident who entered the country illegally over a decade ago, as a sign the Democrats are more committed to protecting migrants than American citizens. Abrego Garcia's wife and lawyer maintain he does not have ties to MS-13. The administration called his deportation an “administrative error” and has openly defied the Supreme Court's order to facilitate his return. After the four progressive lawmakers announced they'd arrived in El Salvador, House Republicans' campaign arm labeled the Maryland man Democrats' new “poster child.” The NRCC also offered to pay for Democrats' round-trip airfare to El Salvador if they livestream their trips. “House Democrats have proven they care more about illegal immigrant gang bangers than American families,” National Republican Campaign Committee spokesperson Mike Marinella said in a statement. Matt Bennett, the co-founder of Third Way, a center-left think tank, said the Abrego Garcia case was a “tough and complicated cause” for Democrats to take up, but “[Trump] thumbing his nose at the court is a pretty safe place for Democrats to land politically.” But one Democratic strategist who works with candidates in districts Trump won expressed concern that the nuances of the constitutional rights argument would get lost. “In this case, you get a situation where you're giving the White House and the Republicans a lot of images and visuals that they think are compelling for them.” Democratic strategist Mo Elleithee, meanwhile, argued that Democrats should be careful not to turn Abrego Garcia into a martyr, or keep the focus of their due process argument squarely on him. Instead, he said, the party needs to focus its argument on a White House that has “run amok” in a way that threatens all Americans, including US citizens who have been unfairly detained by immigration officials. “The Democrats who are going down there ought to be saying … ‘If a judge says he's a bad guy, then let's deport him,'” Elleithee said. “They're doing it because they want to distract people from the fact that our economy is in a tailspin thanks to them, their tariffs,” Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said Sunday on CNN's “State of the Union.” Gavin Newsom, a California Democrat and potential 2028 presidential candidate, agreed with members of his party calling on the administration to follow the Supreme Court's orders. But he also called the push to return the Maryland man a “distraction” and a “tough case” for Democrats, because some voters might view the party as defending MS-13 or “someone who's out of sight, out of mind in El Salvador.” “They don't want this debate on the tariffs, they don't want to be accountable to the markets today,” Newsom said during a press conference on tariffs last week. “I think a lot of voters, both Republican and Democrat, are tired of elected officials and politicians who just put their finger to the wind,” Van Hollen separately told CNN's Dana Bash on Sunday. Critics of the law argue that its mandatory detention provisions erode due process rights for some migrants. At least one Democratic lawmaker, Connecticut Rep. Jahana Hayes, has said she regrets backing the bill. Matt Barreto, a Democratic strategist and pollster who worked on Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign, said Democrats' response to the Abrego Garcia case shows that the party is finding its footing on how to address immigration and Trump, with Van Hollen leading the way. Still, he said, Democrats could do more to defend immigrants. “I think on immigration, in particular, Democrats can push back harder to demonstrate that these are not criminals,” Barreto said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At most places Melissa Valliant goes when dining out, she carries in her backpack a set of reusable flatware — prepared to refuse the disposable utensils she says are part of the plastic pollution crisis that's inextricably linked with the climate crisis. Plastic is made from chemicals derived from fossil fuels, the burning of which drive the climate crisis by producing planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide and methane. Related article Toxic chemical in black plastic utensils and toys is being allowed to proliferate by EPA, lawsuit alleges “Plastic production, specifically, is warming the planet four times faster than air travel,” Valliant said. The resulting pollutants have led to a higher rate of cancer in those areas. Processing crude oil also requires a significant amount of energy, Dr. Jillian Goldfarb, associate professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at Cornell University in New York state, said via email. Some reports estimate that potentially between 36 billion and 40 billion plastic utensils are used every year just in the United States, which is more than 100 million per day, Valliant said. You might think recycling plastic flatware may offset the harms of using it. Related article Should we reconsider having children due to fears about the climate crisis? “In landfills, plastic utensils are weakened by mechanical forces like the friction of moving and being compressed among literally tons of trash, as well as biological and chemical means, like the bacteria present in landfills and corrosive chemicals,” Goldfarb said. “While this does little to degrade the utensils in a meaningful time frame, it does lead to the release of more microplastics, which can travel with leachate and can eventually contaminate groundwater supplies.” Burning plastic utensils releases carbon dioxide into the environment, Goldfarb said, and an incinerator that isn't at peak performance can release particulate matter and carbon monoxide. However, emissions of these pollutants from burning are typically low when compared with those from landfills, according to reports by the US Environmental Protection Agency. The agency monitors air emissions and has standards for pollutants, Goldfarb said. The production process for plastics has a significantly worse impact on the environment than individuals' use of them does, which is “just another reason why waste management solutions for single-use plastic and plastic in general are not going to significantly curb this crisis,” Valliant said. Producing a pound of bamboo forks, for example, expends 0.46 kilowatts per hour, whereas making a pound of plastic forks expends 11 kilowatts per hour, according to Goldfarb. And if a plastic fork weighs about 5 grams, our landfills would be spared roughly 200,000 tons of single-use plastic utensils, “a weight equivalent to 889 Statues of Liberty,” Valliant added. “In the sea of plastic waste we create each year, one person switching to reusable silverware is unlikely to alter the global environmental impacts of plastic utensils on a climate-mitigation scale,” Goldfarb said. “Yet this person's action — if shared and discussed with others — can form the basis for a community of change. “Across the country, states and municipalities are banning single-use plastics (including utensils) in growing numbers,” Goldfarb added. Related article Saving water can help us deal with the climate crisis. Additionally, by reducing your share of plastic waste and its impact on pollution and the climate crisis, you would also be lowering the odds of microplastics residing in your body, experts said — a phenomenon increasingly detected by recent research. Studies have found microplastics in human blood, lungs, placentas, brains and testicles. “This is really concerning, because a lot of these chemicals are associated with cancer, hormone disruption, diabetes, fertility issues — the more we learn, the scarier it gets,” Valliant said. Try this one thing, and you'll be heading in the right direction.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump endorsed Rep. Andy Biggs's (R-AZ) campaign to be Arizona's next governor, marking an unusual move to back not one but two GOP candidates in the race. Republican Karrin Taylor Robson first garnered Trump's support for her gubernatorial ambitions in December 2024, before Biggs made his entry into the race in late January. “When Andy Biggs decided to run for Governor, quite unexpectedly, I had a problem — Two fantastic candidates, two terrific people, two wonderful champions, and it is therefore my Great Honor TO GIVE MY COMPLETE AND TOTAL ENDORSEMENT TO BOTH,” he continued. The president's split endorsement comes as both Biggs, a member of the hard-line conservative House Freedom Caucus, and Taylor Robson have competed to showcase their Trumplike appeal to voters. Biggs has faithfully backed Trump's controversial global tariffs and pulled to the president's side during a high-stakes government spending fight earlier this year. When she announced her gubernatorial bid, Taylor Robson promised her run for governor would “support President @realDonaldTrump, lock down the border, and create jobs for Arizona.” Katie Hobbs (D-AZ), who won her 2022 election by a narrow margin, with under 1% of the vote. Both GOP primary candidates claimed Trump's latest announcement as a win for their respective campaigns in statements Monday evening. It's been an honor to support you and fight for your agenda since 2016,” Biggs said. This isn't the first time Trump has handed out a dual endorsement.</p>
