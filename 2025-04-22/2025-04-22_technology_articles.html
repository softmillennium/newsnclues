                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Power delivery hotspots can run hotter than the GPU core itself. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Igor's Lab has discovered a worrying trend among all Nvidia Blackwell RTX 50-series graphics cards, including even faux-budget GPUs like the RTX 5060 Ti. According to a lengthy blog post the outlet published, most if not all RTX 50-series AIB partner cards are allegedly prone to high-temperature hotspots in the power delivery area, which could potentially damage these graphics cards after extended heavy use.The problem lies in the construction of power delivery systems for the affected graphics cards. The PCB, for instance, is made up of several thin copper layers that are connected with power planes. Board partners could rectify this issue by using heavier-duty materials, which is commonplace in server and industrial GPUs. However, the product cost of these materials is supposedly too great for board partners to take advantage of them on consumer graphics cards.Another issue Igor's Lab highlights are flaws in Nvidia's Thermal Design Guide. This guide is a document made for all Nvidia add-in board partners that serves as a thermal planning document for Nvidia's reference PCB designs, aimed at helping AIB's create properly cooled Nvidia graphics cards. Igor's Lab highlighted flaws in Nvidia's RTX 40-series guide, revealing that many of the document's parameters are specified under ideal environmental conditions, rather than being optimized for a worst-case scenario.Igor's Lab put a PNY RTX 5070 and a Palit RTX 5080 Gaming Pro OC under a thermal camera to demonstrate the aforementioned thermal issues. By contrast, the GPU core was sitting at 70 °C.The PNY RTX 5070 was far worse, measuring 107.3 °C in the same area due to its significantly shorter PCB (the GPU core was sitting at a much chillier 69.7 °C). The main problem is that PNY's RTX 5070 has fewer phases than the Palit RTX 5080, forcing the entire power delivery system to cope with higher current density, which in turn increases temperatures.The main issue with both cards is that inadequate cooling is being applied to keep the power delivery system as cool as possible (or at least cool enough to ensure longevity). The RTX 5070 likewise went from 107.3 °C to a more sustainable "well below 95 °C" — though that's still quite high.Igor's Lab's findings show key improvements that could be made to RTX 50-series graphics cards in the power delivery area. Many of these graphics cards have a hotspot area around the VRM area that can far exceed temperatures on the GPU die itself. Allegedly, 80 degrees is close to the limit at which long-term electromigration and "ageing effects" can occur, which could eventually cause these graphics cards to die over the years of use.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Khloe Kardashian has formerly launched her new food company, Khloud, and its first product, a protein popcorn, set to hit Target starting April 29th. Back in December, TechCrunch reported that Kardashian and her mother, Kris Jenner, were looking to raise at least $10 million for a business called Khloud. Other investors include Serena Ventures, William Morris Endeavor (WME), and Shrug Capital. Khloud says its popcorn is crafted from whole-grain corn and that its “Khoud Dust,” a milk protein and seasoning blend sprinkled on it, gives each serving seven grams of protein. In addition to Target, the product will also be sold on its website. Kardashian says the mission of her snack brand is to offer more nutritious alternatives made from “clean” ingredients. It somewhat makes sense — numerous articles have been written about their favorite foods (including a dedicated Instagram page), and anywhere there is widespread potential consumer interest, there is a widespread chance for celebrities to make money. Now, their empire spreads from household cleaning products to the food in our pantries.

Every day, I scan through retailers and keep an eye on stock levels and pricing for the most popular PC components. I've started to notice that the stock levels of the 50-series graphics cards from Nvidia are trickling in more regularly. Sometimes PC building companies make savings by switching to OEM parts like the power supply, memory, and storage. This, of course, is not always the case. The ABS Eurus Aqua packs one of the best CPUs for gaming - the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, as well as Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070 Ti graphics card, 32GB of DDR5 6000MHz memory, and a 2TB M.2 NVMe SSD. ABS Eurus Aqua Gaming PC (RTX 5070 Ti): now $2,599 at Newegg (was $2,899)A potent gaming PC build sees the ABS Eurus Aqua Gaming PC pack one of the best CPUs for gaming - the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070 Ti graphics card with 16GB of GDDR7 VRAM, 32GB of DDR5 6000MHz memory and a 2TB M.2 NVMe SSD for installing you games on. It's always cheaper to assemble the parts and build your own PC, but this isn't for everyone, and there's no shame in that. Based on current pricing, this deal isn't too bad, and if anything goes wrong with the PC, you have one warranty to worry about and can easily request a fix or replacement, which is something you don't get when building your own rig.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Monday, Francis' passing at the age of 88 led to an effect of a different kind: a surge in viewership for Conclave, director Edward Berger's Oscar-winning film about what happens in the Vatican when church leaders are locked in a room—or, well, the Sistine Chapel—to decide who will be the next pope. Streaming viewership for Conclave increased 283 percent after Pope Francis' death, jumping from 1.8 million minutes watched on April 20 to 6.9 million minutes watched on Monday, according to data from analytics firm Luminate. Netflix's The Two Popes, meanwhile, saw a 417 percent increase in viewership over that same period, jumping from 290,000 minutes to 1.5 million minutes. In some ways, these numbers are to be expected. Conclave's arrival last year and eight Oscar nominations (it won for Best Adapted Screenplay) had already made it a popular film. While the numbers are impressive, Luminate has seen similar boosts after other significant news events, according to spokesperson Jimmy Harney. When presidential candidate Donald Trump announced JD Vance as his running mate during the Republican National Convention last year, viewership for Netflix's Hillbilly Elegy, based on Vance's memoir, jumped 1,180 percent, according to Luminate. When news came out that Vice President Kamala Harris would likely be the Democrats' candidate for president, US viewership for HBO's Veep increased 353 percent. Theoretically, Conclave's viewership numbers could climb even higher in the coming days. Early Tuesday, the movie became available to stream for Prime members. Following Pope Francis' death—an announcement that sent Catholics around the world into mourning—several news outlets (including this one) pointed to Conclave's timeliness. According to Luminate data, other pope-centric films like Netflix's Pope Francis biographic series Call Me Francis, haven't seen the same huge spikes—yet.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. With many motherboard manufacturers sacrificing smaller PCIe x8, x4, and x1 slots on modern boards, the humble M.2 slot is finding new life beyond solid state drives (SSDs). According to early testing by Interfacing Linux, the device does not come with any mounting hardware for the HDMI cable ends, but you can find cheap ones from Amazon or MODDYI. Designed specifically for embedded systems and small form factor PCs, the device offers dual-channel 2K HDMI capture with an M.2 interface utilizing the PCIe 2.0 x4 lanes. With a maximum power draw of just 4.17W, the approach not only seems energy-efficient, but it also eliminates the need for full-sized PCIe cards. The product page indicates that the capture card makes use of FPGA-based video processing, and claims to provide high-quality up/down/cross-scaling, picture controls, and color space conversion without putting a strain on the host system's CPU.The card supports image capture resolutions up to 2048x2160, or video capture at up to 144 frames per second. A specific example of 1920x1080 at up to 80 FPS is listed on the specifications page.A key benefit of the Eco Capture series is its software support. It also offers support for native video APIs like DirectShow, DirectKS, Wave API/DirectSound/WASAPI, V4L2, and ALSA.The Eco Capture Dual HDMI M.2 card is listed at $385, and is currently available on Amazon, B&H Photo, and other online resellers. Magewell has a wide range of options under its Eco Capture series. ​Introduced back in 2023, these cards are similar to the Eco Capture Dual HDMI M.2 card but can support up to 4K capture at 60 frames per second.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As an AI engineer at Meta, Boris Valkov helped build PyTorch, one of the world's largest machine learning libraries. Taking his years of software engineering experience at VMware and Meta, Valkov teamed up with Stan Stoyanov and aimed to marry AI with customer service to help businesses generate additional revenue. The pair talked to more than 100 companies in different industries and verticals and discovered that in the home services vertical, many sales begin with a call made to a call center. Home services include companies such as HVAC, plumbing, and roofing, among others. The premise behind Lace is that if a customer calls in to one of these businesses, it can either convert into a sale — or not. The Mountain View-based company works with over 100 businesses, such as A1 Garage Door Service, Sage Home, Eco Plumbers, Matrix, and Lee's Air. (However, it only started selling to customers at the end of 2023.) Some businesses that use Lace see double-digit revenue growth, Valkov said. And today, Lace is announcing a total of $19 million in funding since its early 2022 inception, the company tells TechCrunch exclusively. The total raised includes a previously unannounced $5 million pre-seed round led by Canvas Ventures and, more recently, a $14 million seed raise led by Bek Ventures. Valkov declined to reveal valuation, saying only that the seed financing was an “up” round. “There's a growing trend of applying AI to make a real impact in sectors historically underserved by tech, and this team has a keen understanding of how to do just that — accurately identifying and addressing the needs of these often overlooked segments represents an enormous opportunity,” he told TechCrunch.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's that time of year again: Rick and Morty is back with a new season next month, and Adult Swim's got a new trailer teasing what's in store. So what wacky adventures will the Smith family get up to next? Earlier in April, Adult Swim revealed the episode titles for a new season, which continue the series' trend of referencing recent and popular movies. Season seven featured a handful of big moments like Rick taking vengeance on the counterpart who killed his family, Evil Morty striking out on his own, and Morty realizing his worst fear is being left behind by Rick. When io9 talked to showrunner Scott Marder in 2023, he confirmed the death of Rick Prime will be felt for quite a while, and that's just part of their plans for the 12-season show. “There are a lot of chess pieces that are moving,” he teased at the time, “And I'm excited for everyone to see where they fall.” Rick and Morty season eight premieres May 25 on Adult Swim. Check out when to expect the latest Marvel, Star Wars, and Star Trek releases, what's next for the DC Universe on film and TV, and everything you need to know about the future of Doctor Who.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many games now push beyond the reach of 8GB cards. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Despite launching just a week ago, Nvidia's RTX 5060 Ti 8GB struggles in numerous games. In-depth testing by Australian reviewer Hardware Unboxed reveals a stark difference between the RTX 5060 Ti 8GB and its 16GB sibling. Testing shows a significant performance drop-off, frame time stutters, texture pop-in issues, and in some cases game crashes.Nvidia opted to not send any reviewers the 8GB cards, so Hardware Unboxed bought a unit for independent testing. Considering many RTX 5060 Ti owners won't upgrade for several years, 8GB will become increasingly restrictive, and there's only so much upscaling and frame generation can do.Both RTX 5060 Ti models use the GB206 die with 4,608 CUDA cores and a 128-bit interface. That's a memo Nvidia seemingly didn't get — or filed in the trash can while talking up neural rendering. Following the pattern of its 8GB Ada Lovelace brethren, the RTX 5060 Ti 8GB's texture pop-in issues persist in Hogwarts Legacy, and those issues extend to Space Marine 2.Moving over to 4K, the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB delivered smooth-sailing in Horizon Forbidden West, running at 70 FPS using DLSS Performance mode and Very High settings. Here, the RTX 5060 Ti 8GB's limitations are evident again, as it struggles to maintain even a cinematic experience (~15 FPS) at the same settings. You need to be very aware of where its limits lie, and for the cost of one major game release, opting for the 16GB card represents a much better choice.At $379, this GPU might be fine for esports, but there are a lot of compromises. An 8GB card won't hold its position well over time, and you'll get stuck with the nagging worry of missing out. 12GB represents the bare minimum we'd recommend for most gaming GPUs that cost $400 or more. Technically the 5060 Ti 8GB card is supposed to come in below that mark, though retail availability in the U.S. at least has been very poor.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sony has wanted to remake 1997's I Know What You Did Last Summer for a decade, and it finally got its wish. The teens themselves soon realize it's connected to a car accident from the previous summer they were involved in and never owned up to for fear of punishment—but what's worse than being killed by someone with a grudge? Apparently, the only ones who can help them make sense of this whole thing are Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt) and Ray Bronson (Freddie Prinze Jr.), survivors from the first two films. The first two I Know What You Did Last Summer movies were followed up by a direct-to-DVD movie centered on a group of unconnected kids in Colorado, followed by a one-season show on Prime Video based more on the 1973 novel than the movies themselves. Do Revenge director Jennifer Kaytin Robinson got the gig for this new movie after her pitch, and may be looking to pass the torch from Julie and Ray to whoever survives this one. After all, summer never ends, and neither do slashers. Also starring Madelyn Cline, Tyriq Withers, Chase Sui Wonders, and Jonah Hauer-King, the new I Know What You Did Last Summer releases July 18.

This book helped clarify for me that no successful marketplace starts out as a marketplace - simply because you need to start out with ready access to one side (likely the supply side as in the Uber & AirBnB examples) and build demand.The marketplace/network then emerges strategically as more suppliers are onboarded.This insight helped quickly focus and filter the marketplace ideas we didn't have any business pursuing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A startup called Superpower is publicly launching what it calls the world's first super app that is designed to help people better understand and take care of their health. For $499, the startup offers biannual lab testing that analyzes over 100 blood biomarkers across 21 categories, giving people a more comprehensive look at their health than a standard physical does. Members conduct these tests twice a year, either at home or one of Superpower's 2,000 partner labs nationwide. Superpower's web app considers the results of these tests with past medical records, fitness trackers, and genetics and uses AI to create a personalized overview of your health to outline any possible concerns. The app then gives you an action plan to take control of your health. The startup was founded in 2023 by Jacob Peters, Max Marchione, and Kevin Unkrich. Peters nearly lost his life after spending $2 million on medical bills battling several serious conditions that went undiagnosed by multiple specialists. Marchione faced decades of misdiagnoses from over 20 doctors, and Unkrich lost his best friend to a brain tumor in his teens — just two days before he was scheduled for an MRI. They recognized that these aren't isolated incidents, as 40% of Americans suffer from conditions that could have been identified and addressed earlier with the right information. “There's this big gap between the best of healthcare and what most people have access to,” Marchione told TechCrunch in an interview. And six years ago, we didn't think that was possible. Two to three years ago, when we started the company, we did realize it was possible with the advent of all sorts of new technologies such as AI.” Members can also get (for additional fees) additional specialty tests, such as a gut microbiome analysis and a Grail cancer screening that can detect over 50 types of cancer before symptoms appear. Once members receive their personalized health results, they are connected to an integrated marketplace of healthcare service providers. Superpower also offers access to a 24/7 AI and human hybrid concierge care team that members can message for personalized guidance. “The reality is that every single day there are a billion Google searches related to health,” Marchione said. Alongside the public launch, the company is announcing a $30 million Series A funding round led by Forerunner, with participation from notable celebrities including Vanessa Hudgens, Steve Aoki, and NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo. Prior to joining the publication in 2021, she was a telecom reporter at MobileSyrup.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“No one knows what the hell is going on,” he tells WIRED. Drummond was referring to President Donald Trump's so-called reciprocal tariffs, which sent global markets into a tailspin when they were announced on April 2. It's unclear what will happen when the pause ends in early July. Several venture capitalists working at small to midsize firms told WIRED in recent weeks they are concerned that Trump's tariffs could slow down tech investments, further decelerate an already sluggish market for initial public offerings, and possibly even put some tech startups out of business. Others say that, at least for now, they're staying away from investing in hardware companies, which may be hit particularly hard by Trump's tariffs. Siegler, an independent investor and former partner at GV Management Company. One of Drummond's portfolio companies is an internet-of-things platform, which he says is now scrutinizing its inventory management strategy, trying to determine when to order from suppliers and if it can find new ones outside of China in places like Vietnam. Siegler says that if the tariffs remain in place, he believes VC firms are going to “distance themselves even further from basically all hardware startups.” He adds that some investment funds have stayed away from hardware for a long time for other reasons. “Hardware is much harder and riskier than software—but this just escalated that to the nth degree.” Hazard encouraged startup founders to think through the risks and opportunities the tariffs will likely create for their businesses, as well as to evaluate their financing strategies. “And be really judicious about how your capital is being deployed.” Managing partner Charles Hudson told WIRED that his venture firm, Precursor, has stakes in several ecommerce startups that could be “heavily impacted” by Trump's tariffs. Precursor, which invests in early-stage startups, just raised more than $65 million for its fifth fund. Hudson said in a recent interview with The Information that he plans to make investments over a three-year period rather than the standard two years. Other VCs agree that the secondary market is likely to heat up. “VCs used to be the ultimate HODLers, holding on for dear life, riding it out until a startup they invested in IPO'd,” says Drummond. “But over the past 10 years they've had to become much more disciplined sellers and figure out how to deliver liquidity sooner.” That's been true for a while because of rising interest rates and VCs being more cautious, but it's “especially true now,” he says. Analysts from PitchBook, a database for statistics about the venture capital and private equity markets, warn the tariffs could have a cooling effect on international investments, noting that startups once celebrated for having “global first” strategies might now be seen as vulnerable. “For decades, VC has flourished in an increasingly borderless world, but another week of tariff wars is prompting a major reassessment,” PitchBook reporter Leah Hodgson wrote earlier this month. Before Trump took office, investors had been hopeful that the tech IPO market would continue rebounding this year after falling into a slump in 2022. Accounting firm KPMG noted in a report published earlier this month that “lingering market uncertainties” had led many startups to delay their imminent public debuts this quarter. The mobile banking service Chime, ticket giant StubHub, and Swedish “buy now, pay later” firm Klarna all hit pause on planned public offerings. AI infrastructure firm CoreWeave was the outlier—it began trading shares in late March. “With expectations for the recovery of the IPO market moving farther out again, we could see a shift in VC firms needing to reallocate investment priorities, as some companies may need additional funding prior to a now more-distant IPO,” Conor Moore, global head of KPMG Private Enterprise, said in the report. Industries like AI, defense tech, and security could now be ripe for investment. “Pockets like defense tech might be ‘safe' bets because those startups were trying to shy away from the Chinese supply chain anyway, for obvious reasons,” says Siegler. Logistics startups, especially those specializing in nearshoring, also stand to benefit from Trump's policy changes. “If we're headed into a period of economic uncertainty, and our AI companies are focused on helping their customers be more agile and generate more revenue, there's a lot of potential value there,” he tells WIRED. OpenAI and Anthropic alone have announced investments totaling more than $43 billion this quarter. But those massive fundraising rounds are outliers that likely exclude most small and midsize investors. And a booming AI market—which includes startups that haven't yet proven a path to profitability—may not be enough to offset the volatility of this new geopolitical era.
