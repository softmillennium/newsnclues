                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The research recently published in NPJ Science of Learning used a virtual reality game that involved picking flowers with bees in some of the blossoms that would sting the participant-simulated by a mild electrical stimulation on the hand. Researchers worked with 70 neurotypical participants between the ages of 20 and 30. Claire Marino, a research assistant in the ZVR Lab, and Pavel Rjabtsenkov, a Neuroscience graduate student at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, were co-first authors of the study that found that the people who learned to distinguish between the safe and dangerous areas-where the bees were and were not-showed better spatial memory and had lower anxiety, while participants who did not learn the different areas had higher anxiety and heightened fear even in safe areas. Surprisingly, they discovered that temporary feelings of anxiety had the biggest impact on learning and not a person's general tendency to feel anxious. These results help explain why some people struggle with anxiety-related disorders, such as PTSD, where they may have difficulty distinguishing safe situations from dangerous ones. The findings suggest that excessive anxiety disrupts spatial learning and threat recognition, which could contribute to chronic fear responses. Understanding these mechanisms may help improve treatments for anxiety and stress-related disorders by targeting how people process environmental threats." Suarez-Jimenez explains that it is now important to understand if individuals with psychopathologies of anxiety and stress have similar variations in spatial memory. Adding an attention-tracking measure, like eye-tracking, to future studies could help determine whether a focus on potential threats impacts broader environmental awareness. Additional authors include Caitlin Sharp, Zonia Ali, Evelyn Pineda, Shreya Bavdekar, Tanya Garg, Kendal Jordan, Mary Halvorsen, Carlos Aponte, and Julie Blue of the University of Rochester Medical Center, and Xi Zhu, PhD, of Columbia University Irving Medical Center.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a preclinical study led by McGill University researchers, two drugs targeting "zombie cells" have been shown to treat the underlying cause of chronic low back pain. The condition affects millions of people worldwide. Current treatments manage symptoms through painkillers or surgery, without addressing the root cause. Our findings are exciting because it suggests we might be able to treat back pain in a completely new way, by removing the cells driving the problem, not just masking the pain." Lisbet Haglund, Senior Author, Professor in McGill's Department of Surgery and Co-director of the Orthopaedic Research Laboratory at the Montreal General Hospital (MUHC) Senescent cells, often called zombie cells, build up in the spinal discs as people age or when discs are damaged. Instead of dying off like normal cells, these aging cells linger and cause inflammation, pain and damage to the spine. To explore a potential solution, the research team administered two drugs orally to mice: o-Vanillin, a natural compound, and RG-7112, an FDA-approved cancer drug. They found the drugs could clear zombie cells from the spine, reduce pain and inflammation, and slow or even reverse damage to spinal discs after eight weeks of treatment. Each of the drugs had a beneficial effect, but the impact was greatest when they were administered together. "We were surprised that an oral treatment could reach the spinal discs, which are hard to access and present a major hurdle in treating back pain," said Haglund. Notably, o-Vanillin wasn't originally intended to be part of the study and was included almost by chance. Haglund explained that while testing other drugs, her team decided to add the compound, derived from turmeric and known for its anti-inflammatory properties, to see whether it might be effective in this situation. Analogs of RG-7112 are known to do this in osteoarthritis and cancer research, but had not been used to treat back pain. They believe these drugs have the potential to treat other age-related diseases driven by senescent cells, such as arthritis or osteoporosis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China's success in achieving malaria-free status in 2021 offers crucial lessons for the global malaria fight, say experts in a special collection of articles published by The BMJ today. But they also warn that if funding declines, as is expected under US President Trump's drastic policy changes impacting collective efforts on global health, "the hard won gains of the past two decades would be rapidly reversed." The collection examines China's national strategy, presents case studies from Hainan and Yunnan provinces and the Huai River Basin, and details the evolving interventions that ultimately led to elimination. In an editorial to launch the collection, independent experts explain that global and national funding for malaria control has led to major gains in child survival and supported progress towards elimination, with 45 countries and one territory now having achieved this milestone. However, they warn that if replenishment of the Global Fund (which supports malaria control) and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (funding for malaria vaccines) declines in 2025, malaria cases and deaths are predicted to increase. This collection offers important lessons for countries pursuing malaria control and elimination, especially in Africa, where those goals have broad political support, they say. For example, in Hainan Province, elimination was achieved through long term use of overlapping interventions-bed nets, indoor spraying, drug administration, and sustained surveillance-that evolved with changing risk levels, showing that persistent but flexible strategies can succeed even in highly endemic areas. Recognising that success can breed complacency-and resurgence is another important lesson. Control was restored only after reintroducing mass drug administration, robust vector control, and community mobilisation, highlighting the danger of prematurely scaling back efforts and the need for long term vigilance. Other lessons include the importance of cross border collaboration, real time data sharing, and sustained surveillance, while novel approaches to financing are also urgently needed, led by national governments and their ministries of finance and include regional banks and innovative partnerships, they add. Elimination requires long term tenacity; not just funds, but data driven foresight," they write. "As global malaria efforts face shifting donor priorities and resulting financing gaps, The BMJ's new collection offers timely insights for policy makers, implementers, and funders alike. China and other countries that have achieved elimination have shown us the destination-now the challenge is translation to action for those left behind," they conclude.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a wide-ranging Genomic Press Interview, Dr. Jeremie Poschmann of INSERM and Université de Nantes shares the story behind his bold, data-centric approach to immunology and translational science. His lab focuses on the molecular analysis of blood-derived immune cells using multi-omics tools, integrating genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics to uncover how immune states evolve across patient populations. This accessible window into immune dynamics allows researchers to chart disease heterogeneity in unprecedented detail. The implications for infectious disease, psychiatric conditions, and even vaccine responsiveness are wide-reaching. "What hooked me early on is the idea that data itself can lead the way," says Dr. Poschmann, describing his formative experience with genome-wide discovery in yeast. "That ability to follow the data rather than impose a question on it was deeply compelling." Later, frustrated by delays in bioinformatics collaboration during his postdoc, he taught himself coding, enabling a level of research independence that now defines his lab. The interview highlights a growing interest in pre-existing immune states-patterns shaped by past infections, environmental exposures, and genetic predisposition. These states, Dr. Poschmann suggests, may explain why people respond so differently to the same pathogen or treatment. "Why do some people get severely ill from SARS-CoV-2, while others remain asymptomatic?" "We now have the tools to explore those questions at scale." Using the blood as a dynamic, systemic readout, his team builds immune signatures that may one day forecast disease risk or therapeutic response-raising tantalizing possibilities: Could personalized immunoprofiles guide vaccine strategies? Could this approach allow for proactive healthcare, rather than reactive treatment? Beyond the lab, Dr. Poschmann is a vocal advocate for improving research infrastructure. Originally trained as a nurse, Dr. Poschmann emphasizes compassion, mentorship, and inclusion in his leadership style. "I don't choose team members based on grades," he says. "I look for mindset-what makes someone original in how they think." Surfing along France's Atlantic coast helps him decompress and reconnect. "But then a perfect set comes, and you must be ready. That combination of grit, patience, and timing is very much like science." Dr. Poschmann's reflections illuminate a broader shift in modern science toward interdisciplinary fluency and data-integrated decision-making. "We're in an era where biology, computation, and medicine are merging," he says. "I want my research to inform not only understanding, but clinical care." His story prompts questions with direct societal relevance: What will it take to mainstream immune profiling in everyday medicine? How can we make complex data actionable at the point of care? And perhaps most importantly-what barriers, scientific or structural, must we dismantle to realize a truly personalized, prevention-first model of health? Dr. Jeremie Poschmann's Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today's most influential scientific breakthroughs. This format provides an ideal starting point for profiles that delve into the scientist's impact on the field, while also touching on broader human themes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I direct the Neurological and Behavioral Outcomes Center at University Hospitals Cleveland. Joining me here today is Dr Camilla Kilbane, who directs the Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorder Center, also at University Hospitals Cleveland. Camilla Kilbane, MD: Thank you for inviting me. What do you think are the most important areas or topics that we have to address with our patients and their families about the issue of tardive dyskinesia (TD)? Does it make you not want to go out in public?” Sajatovic: As a psychiatrist, I am more likely to see people who are exhibiting movements consistent with TD that the patient isn't aware of. They'll have been prescribed an antipsychotic medication for a variety of different reasons. So, I will talk about the specific role of antipsychotic drugs in being a risk factor for TD. Sometimes it's a dialogue with the patient, sometimes with a family member to consider, “What is this?” Is it something that is a burden for you?” And, “Could we look at whether there are treatment options that might help you?” Kilbane: When patients come to the neurologist, there is a self-selection bias, I think, and most of my patients are probably much more motivated and have done more research about the diagnosis as opposed to those who come to the psychiatrist, who either refers the patient to me or initially approaches the diagnosis. Martha, can you tell me how your care plan might differ depending on the patient and the clinical diagnosis that caused them to need psychotropic medication? Sajatovic: Their psychiatric diagnosis definitely is going to be a driver. We know that people with some types of serious mental illness — for example, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder — may process information differently. It may have to be delivered in a slower way or involving others or may need a series of visits. I do think it is really critical to make sure that the patient has a choice and a voice. Regardless of their diagnosis, this could be an opportunity to bring family members in. They may notice impairments or symptoms that are relatively subtle — both psychiatric and TD symptoms — that the patient doesn't volunteer and that I may not see in a 30-minute or 45-minute office visit. Sometimes patients or family members will suggest that they maybe should just stop the drug, and I think that's an important point of communication between the psychiatrist and the patient. I will talk about the likelihood that you will have a psychiatric relapse if we stop the drug or if you stop the drug on your own. Many patients and families will have already experienced having at least one psychiatric relapse episode, and that is usually not something that anybody wants to go through. That is a foundational discussion to have before we go into “What are my treatment options for TD?” Kilbane: I think sometimes people just want information, right? They want to be informed about their condition and feel empowered that they're making the choice themselves, and that can sometimes be a step in the right direction. Then it really becomes a discussion about, “How is it impacting you?” And then we start talking about the medication treatments if they're interested in pursuing those. How do you build that therapeutic trust and alliance with your patients with regards to treating their psychiatric disorder and possibly TD? I would say that's important for any kind of clinician. For mental health clinicians, that it's particularly important because mental health conditions very often are highly stigmatized. I won't dictate most of the time what you need unless it's an acute, immediate safety issue. Just because I think something is a problem or not a problem may not be where they are. I can think of a patient that I had who worked as a hairdresser and clearly had movements of her hands. You know, a little bit of bilateral writhing. So, she had a behavior or a metric that was bothersome to her, and that's what she wanted to see go away. Sometimes people just have to think about it for a while and let it marinate in their head, and then they might be ready at some point. And, of course, when you've already had a side effect to a medication, you may be more cautious to try another medication. My job is to inform patients, give them the information about what I think is going on with them, and then we have the discussion about should there be treatment or not. Kilbane: For me, it's really important to first of all make sure I know what the clinical diagnosis is. What I may perceive as mild TD can have a major impact in somebody's life, whether it's vocational, psychological, or physical. I think the same thing goes for TD. One of the other things I tell patients is that if you decide to try this medication — a VMAT2 inhibitor for this movement — it doesn't mean you have to stay on it for life. So just giving patients the feeling that it's their choice and they can also change their mind, sometimes that also helps in that discussion about should we do it or should we not. Sajatovic: Right, and I would say that the flip argument is very often once they try it, the TD goes away and they feel a lot better. Sajatovic: And then, looking back, they're thinking, “I was a lot more worried about it than I needed to be.” We want to give them the tools and the confidence to make a decision that's right for them every day.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Using pilocarpine eye drops following Kahook Dual Blade (KDB) goniotomy surgery may improve clinical outcomes for patients with glaucoma and reduce the need for future medications, according to new research published by faculty members and trainees in the Department of Ophthalmology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. "The KDB goniotomy is a minimally invasive glaucoma surgery that we do a lot here at the Sue Anschutz-Rodgers Eye Center, and there was some variability in the post-operative eye drop regimen among different providers," says Julia Xia, MD, a uveitis fellow in the department and lead author of the study. "There currently is not a clear evidence-based consensus on whether the drops are beneficial in use after the surgery, so this research sought to address whether those drops made a difference." The study analyzed 532 KDB goniotomy procedures at the Sue Anschutz-Rodgers Eye Center between September 2015 and March 2020, with and without pilocarpine use, and measured surgical success, which the researchers defined as intraocular pressure less than 21 mmHg in addition to either a more than 20% reduction in intraocular pressure or the reduction of one or more topical glaucoma medications. The group using pilocarpine drops had a significantly higher success rate in the first and third month after surgery as well as one year after surgery. They also required significantly less medications than the group that did not use pilocarpine. Researchers estimate that more than 4.2 million adults in the U.S. have glaucoma, an eye disease that gradually damages the optic nerve when there's a build-up of fluid. There is no cure for glaucoma, so ophthalmologists are tasked with helping their patients manage the disease and the excessive intraocular pressure (IOP) that leads to vision problems. Management often includes eye drops and surgeries that aim to reduce IOP. We're making an incision to open up the natural drainage pathway." There are several ways ophthalmologists can perform a goniotomy, but researchers of the study focused their efforts on the Kahook Dual Blade method, which was developed by Malik Y. Kahook, MD, professor of ophthalmology and the Slater Family Endowed Chair in Ophthalmology, over a decade ago on the CU Anschutz Medical Campus. "Pilocarpine historically has been used to lower eye pressure, but it also shrinks the pupil and creates tension in key areas of the drainage pathway," Xia explains. "This theoretically helps ensure that the pathway remains open after someone has healed from surgery which allows fluid to better flow out of the eye." The findings are an important clinical tool for ophthalmologists who perform KDB goniotomy. "The exciting part about this research is that it can be directly applicable to patients," Xia says. "Surgeons can use this evidence as one piece of the decision-making process when thinking about what's best for their patients." While the results from the study are promising, ophthalmologists, including Xia, say pilocarpine drops do often come with some nuances. For many patients, side effects include headache, blurred vision, heightened risk for retinal detachment, and temporary burning or stinging in the eye. Cara Capitena Young, MD, associate professor of ophthalmology and medical director of the Sue Anschutz-Rodgers Eye Center operating room, says there are patients who may not be a good fit for the drops, but the research has convinced her to add pilocarpine drops back into her toolbox and discuss them with her patients. "Drop adherence is a massive barrier to treating glaucoma, so if we can add a drop in the short term that helps reduce the number of drops needed long term, it can be a great option for some patients," she says. "We know from this research that it can extend the success of the surgery well beyond a year, so while the drops might be an additional annoyance for a little bit, it can be worth it."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stanford Medicine researchers have developed a blood test capable of detecting cancers, the ways cancer resists treatments and tissue injury caused by non-cancerous conditions. There are always fragments of both DNA and RNA floating in blood - byproducts of natural cell death from all types of tissues and organs throughout the body, including cancerous tumors. Just as archeologists can learn about ancient societies by studying the garbage they left behind, we can learn a lot about what is going on in the cells of a patient's body based on the degraded RNA molecules that are cleared through the blood. We have developed a sensitive, versatile new type of liquid biopsy that measures cell-free and circulating-tumor RNA and has the potential to enhance personalized medicine in cancer and non-cancer diseases." A paper explaining the method and applications of the cell-free RNA blood test was published in Nature on April 16, 2025. Monica Nesselbush, a postdoctoral scholar at the Stanford Cancer Institute, Bogdan Luca, postdoctoral scholar in pathology, and Young-Jun Jeon, a former postdoctoral scholar at Stanford Medicine who is now a professor at Sungkyunkwan University, are joint first authors. Ash Alizadeh, MD, PhD, the Moghadam Family Professor and a professor of medicine, oncology and hematology, co-led the study with Diehn. There is not a lot of cell-free RNA in the blood, and around 95% of it is the ribosomal RNA that makes up the cellular structures that manufacture proteins. The new blood test analyzes messenger RNA, which makes up less than 5% of the cell-free RNA pool, because these molecules serve as a signal about which genes are expressed as proteins. Focusing on these so-called rare abundance genes increased the ability of the test to correctly identify cancer by over a factor of 50. "Analysis of the rare abundance genes lets us focus on the most relevant subset of RNA for detecting disease, just like archaeologists who want to learn about what people ate might focus on a subset of artifacts such as food containers or utensils," Alizadeh said. Detecting cell-free messenger RNA means the blood test is capable of monitoring conditions that do not involve genetic mutations that are the basis of most DNA-based tests, such as certain causes of resistance to cancer treatments. "Unfortunately, a significant fraction of our patients who are being treated for cancer go on to have their therapy stop working, and that resistance is often based on adaptations that do not involve genetic changes, but instead altering how the cells behave or even how the cells look under a microscope," Alizadeh explained. "Our non-invasive approach has the potential of avoiding surgical biopsies and identifying these common types of resistance earlier before substantial disease burden shows up on scans or presents with symptoms like pain, providing an earlier opportunity to change treatment and improve outcomes." To prevent platelets from affecting test results and obscuring signals from cancer, the researchers developed a combination of molecular and computational strategies that subtract contributions from these numerous cells. The computational approach to overcoming platelet contamination means the method works both on newly collected blood samples and on samples that have been previously collected and stored. "This approach means that the test can be used to examine blood samples currently in the freezer from a completed clinical trial, for example, and could help find a molecular signature that predicts who responded to a drug and who did not," Diehn said. "We can save time by using historical samples to discover a biomarker that can then be applied in real time to patients moving forward." The new cell-free RNA method also provides useful information for non-cancer applications. The test detected high levels of normal lung RNA in blood samples from patients who were intubated and on a ventilator for treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome, a condition that severely damages the lungs and causes the cells to die. The amount of normal lung RNA in blood samples from patients with COVID-19 reflected how sick they were. Researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, and the University of Washington also contributed to the study. The research was supported by the National Institutes of Health (grants R01 CA254179, R01 CA244526, R01 CA257655, R01 CA137008, R01 CA229766, T32 CA121940, T32 CA930240) National Science Foundation of Korea, Stand Up to Cancer Phil Sharpe Award, Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program, Virginia and D.K.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One in ten people will have at least one seizure in their life, but effective treatments for seizures remain very limited, in part due to incomplete understanding of the brain mechanisms involved. Now, research in fruit flies has uncovered a role for two specific brain proteins that are necessary during brain development to prevent seizures. A reduction of either protein during development makes flies prone to seizures without otherwise affecting their ability to move, the researchers found. Importantly, if Imp is reduced, restoring Sdc helps flies recover from seizures more than three times faster. This suggests that these proteins could be a valuable target for future therapies. For people with seizures caused by a similar mechanism, "we hope that this knowledge might contribute to quicker diagnoses and treatment plans," says Paula Roy, PhD, postdoctoral researcher in neurobiology at University of Utah Health and first author on the study. The results are published in eNeuro. Loss of neuronal Imp contributes to seizure behavior through Syndecan function Neuronal Imp contributes to seizures via Syndecan.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Women who experience urinary incontinence after giving birth may get just as much relief from telehealth as they do from physical therapy, a new UC San Francisco study has found. It is the first comparison of telehealth to in-person pelvic physical therapy, and the results open the door to new ways of treating a condition that affects millions of women. This paper provides valuable preliminary evidence of telehealth's effectiveness and overall satisfaction for treating stress urinary incontinence. This is an important step in creating more accessible and affordable care for our postpartum mothers." Jennifer Kinder, PT, DPTSc, associate professor in the UCSF Department of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Science and a women's health clinical specialist Over the next two decades, 43 million women are predicted to have a form of pelvic floor dysfunction. Incontinence often begins after delivering a baby. As many as 30% of women develop incontinence following a first vaginal delivery, and if left untreated, it can become chronic. Preexisting cases also can be aggravated by labor. The study randomized 30 women to receive care either via telehealth or in person. They were on average 1.5 years postpartum, had a median age of 37, had delivered two babies and were in good health. The women reported their symptoms throughout the four-week study, and at five weeks and one year after it ended.
