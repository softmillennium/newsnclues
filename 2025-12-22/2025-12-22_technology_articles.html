                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The professor, Stuart Reges, has taught at UW's Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering since 2004. In January 2022, he included his own land acknowledgment in a syllabus for an introductory programming course, pushing back against the school's recommendation that faculty include a statement recognizing Coast Salish peoples. His version invoked philosopher John Locke's labor theory of property to argue the opposite point — that indigenous peoples could claim “almost none” of the land occupied by UW. A district court sided with UW, but the Ninth Circuit reversed that decision last Friday, Dec. 19. Writing for the majority, Judge Daniel Bress said student discomfort cannot justify retaliation against a professor's speech on matters of public concern. The UW said in a statement that it is weighing its options “We maintain that we have a responsibility to protect our students and that the UW acted appropriately,” the UW statement said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wafer stages, optical elements, sensors, and control subsystems are alleged to be upgraded via secondary channels When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Chinese fabs are quietly extending the useful life and performance of older ASML deep ultraviolet lithography systems by upgrading key subsystems, as Beijing pushes to sustain advanced chip output under tightening U.S. and allied export controls, according to the Financial Times. The effort concerns installed immersion DUV tools, particularly ASML's Twinscan NXT series. It's understood that these activities have been underway over the past year at several leading-edge Chinese fabs, including those operated by SMIC and other state-backed manufacturers. While this upgrade activity will never bring older DUV machines to parity with newer EUV machines, it could provide Chinese manufacturers with a meaningful recovery of capacity at advanced DUV-based nodes that remain commercially viable. For lithography, that meant blocking EUV outright and, more recently, placing tighter licensing requirements on the most capable immersion DUV scanners. Over the past decade, Chinese fabs acquired dozens of high-end DUV tools, which now form the backbone of China's most advanced production lines, particularly for 14 nm, 10 nm, and experimental 7 nm-class processes that rely heavily on multipatterning. Despite tens of billions in capital expenditure on chipmaking tools, China remains more than a decade behind current market leaders. Under current rules, ASML is allowed to provide basic maintenance and support to keep these tools running, but it is restricted from performing upgrades that would materially improve performance beyond narrow thresholds. That has created a gap between what the original equipment manufacturer can legally do and what fabs are technically capable of doing with the right parts and expertise. Into that gap has stepped a growing ecosystem of third-party suppliers and engineers. According to the report, Chinese fabs have sourced replacement or upgraded components such as wafer stages, optical elements, sensors, and control subsystems through secondary markets. Some of these parts originate from dismantled tools outside China, while others are produced by suppliers that operate in regulatory grey zones. This might sound inconsequential on the face of it, but with an outright ban on exports of new tooling, marginal improvements to existing tools compound quickly across high-volume lines. A small improvement in overlay stability can translate into higher yields across dozens of layers. Multipatterning schemes such as self-aligned double or quadruple patterning dramatically increase the number of exposures required per layer, and each exposure introduces additional misalignment risk. ASML's own product pages for the NXT immersion platform make clear how tightly overlay and system stability are linked. Wafer stage accuracy affects not only positioning but vibration and thermal drift, both of which become limiting factors as pattern density increases. Upgrading or replacing these subsystems can claw back some performance that would otherwise be lost to wear and aging. Even without changing the core exposure wavelength or numerical aperture, better stages and sensors can improve effective overlay and reduce the number of wafers scrapped due to misalignment. This does not eliminate the structural disadvantages of DUV at 7nm-class geometries: Cycle times remain longer than EUV-based processes, costs per wafer are higher, and yields are generally lower. But for products where absolute cost is less critical than domestic supply and technical continuity, these penalties are acceptable. Blocking new tool shipments has already occurred, so the harder problem is constraining the flow of parts, expertise, and process knowledge that keeps existing tools competitive — at least for now. Updates to U.S. BIS rules last year point in this direction, with expanded controls on semiconductor manufacturing equipment components, software, and services. Restrictions increasingly target not only lithography scanners themselves but also metrology tools, process control software, and advanced sensors that indirectly affect yields. SMIC has tested homegrown immersion DUV prototypes, and state-backed programs continue to fund long-term EUV research, even if breakthroughs remain distant. What we could see, however, is a slower erosion of the gap that export restrictions were designed to maintain.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Saturday, Politico reported that Kennedy canceled a press conference set for Friday afternoon where he would have formally advised that parents follow the vaccine schedule implemented in Denmark—a system with several fewer vaccine recommendations. RFK Jr. and his allies have been signaling this potential change for quite some time. At the last meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in early December, Tracy Beth Høeg, acting director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), gave a presentation about Denmark's vaccine schedule. Høeg and others have argued that the U.S. should consider adopting Denmark's schedule. Denmark universally recommends childhood vaccines for 10 diseases, whereas the U.S. universally recommends vaccines for 16 diseases (that number was 17 until the recent ACIP-led change to revoke its recommendation for the hepatitis B vaccine). The Worst Ways RFK Jr. Has Harmed Public Health This Year Soon after, President Donald Trump stated that he would push to change the U.S. vaccine schedule to match that of other “peer countries” and issued an executive order on December 5 to that effect. A second official added that the decision would be “politically risky.” To be clear, Kennedy and others have never presented a reasonable case for such a sweeping change to the vaccine schedule. There is no credible evidence that the amount or timing of vaccines currently recommended in the U.S. poses a health risk to children—a reality still acknowledged by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (for now). Some anti-vaccination proponents have also argued that specific ingredients commonly included in vaccines, such as aluminum, could be dangerous if given repeatedly, but the majority of studies have not found any such risk, including one published just this past summer. Experts have also pointed out that while Denmark does recommend fewer vaccines in general than the U.S., there are important reasons why this schedule isn't easily transferable to the latter. This includes improved screening for vaccine-preventable diseases like hepatitis B. Notably, the U.S. once tried to vaccinate only high-risk groups for hepatitis B but eventually switched to a universal system after cases failed to significantly decline; this approach then helped dramatically reduce new infections, particularly among newborns. ‘We Are Doing Harm': RFK Jr.'s ACIP Guts Universal Hep B Vaccination at Birth Leaving that aside, plenty of other high-income countries are much closer to the U.S. in the number of vaccines they recommend to their residents, including Canada, Germany, and Japan, to name a few. It's certainly possible that some vaccines aren't or will eventually not be worthwhile for children in the U.S. to routinely receive. But any changes should be carefully weighed and discussed by actual health experts and researchers, not abruptly implemented under the radar on a Friday afternoon by politicians who have a clear anti-vaccine bias like RFK Jr. Unfortunately, while Kennedy may have been stymied this time, it's almost certain that this won't be his last such attempt. People who switched from semaglutide or tirzepatide to orforglipron largely maintained their weight loss. The grants involved research studying autism and sudden infant deaths. Cheese can be part of a brain-healthy diet and might even help lower dementia risk, researchers in Sweden have concluded.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The team at Retro, a photo-sharing app for close friends and family, is experimenting with how generative AI can be put to more creative uses. To try out the latest, cutting-edge AI technologies, the team built a new app called Splat, which lets you turn any photo into a coloring book page for kids. As any parent will tell you, kids love to color. And thanks to the web, there's a seemingly infinite number of coloring book pages available for printing at home. However, many of the websites hosting these pages are filled with ads and other clutter, making them difficult to navigate. Other times, the printable pages are only available for a small fee, which some parents don't want to pay, given the disposable nature of much of kids' scribbled-on art projects. That inspired Retro's team to develop an app for printing coloring book pages at home — from either your own photos or those it provides in kid-friendly, educational categories, such as animals, space, flowers, fairy tales, robots, cars, and more. The app will then transform your picture using AI into either an on-screen or printable page for kids to color. You also can choose if you want to let kids color the photo as a printable page or on-screen (great in a pinch when kids are bored, but you don't want them sucked into a TV show or game). You can try one generative AI project to get a feel for the app. Splat is one of several experiments that uses generative AI to help inspire kids' creativity and imagination in new ways. Another, Stickerbox, offers printed AI-generated stickers for coloring, while Casio also launched a fluffy robotic pet called Moflin that uses AI to develop its personality over time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ditch Valve's handheld and pick up this faster Steam Deck rival instead When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Valve has officially discontinued the LCD Steam Deck, so if you're looking for a powerful handheld gaming PC that isn't going to break the bank, then this Lenovo Legion Go S is your answer. Amazon have dropped the price of this Lenovo handheld back to under $600, offering better specs, along with Valve's very own SteamOS to rival Windows 11. Priced at just $589.99 right now, this Lenovo handheld is one of the more affordable ways to play your Steam library on-the-go. As far specs go, we've put this Lenovo Legion Go S portable on our best handheld gaming PCs guide as one of the more powerful alternatives to the now-aging Steam Deck. The Lenovo Legion Go S is a budget-friendly handheld gaming PC. The AMD Ryzen Z2 Go is a Zen 3+ processor, fitted with four CPU cores and eight threads, along with a boost clock speed up to 4.3 GHz. Compare and contrast to the Steam Deck, which uses a Zen 2-based, custom-designed Van Gogh APU, which features only four CPU cores, along with an RDNA 2 GPU with only eight compute units. When we put this handheld to the test in our Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS review, this Z2 Go variant proved to be less powerful than the more expensive Z1 Extreme model, but the gulf between them isn't huge, and running SteamOS is certainly a better option for gamers than running it with Windows 11. Frame rates remained playable in several intensive games that we tested, including the notorious CPU-heavy Cyberpunk 2077 at 800p, which was able to maintain 50fps on average. The same handheld with Windows 11 installed, meanwhile, was only able to manage 32fps. Coupled with this AMD processor is 16GB of LPDDR5X-6400 RAM and a 1TB PCIe 4.0 SSD for storage. You're also getting an 8-inch IPS display, which features a native resolution of 1,920 x 1,200, along with a variable refresh rate of 120 Hz. This device doesn't feature an OLED panel like the similarly-priced Steam Deck OLED, but it does have a bigger screen (8-inch vs 7.4), along with a higher native resolution and VRR support, coupled with the already-mentioned superior gaming performance. The Lenovo Legion Go S also features a bigger 55.5 Whr battery which we found in our review to last for around two hours while using the device's power-saving profile. Ultimately, though, it's SteamOS that makes this handheld truly great. Yes, Microsoft is trying to improve the handheld experience on Windows 11, but SteamOS continues to be the best option for handheld gaming, especially on cheaper hardware. The market for any kind of gaming machine, be it a laptop, PC, console, or a handheld like this Lenovo is under threat at the moment. As SSD and RAM prices continue rising, handhelds are currently one of the most affordable devices for picking up and playing PC games, with this Lenovo Legion Go S running SteamOS sitting near the top of the pack.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The official standard time of the United States is kept by around 10 to 15 atomic clocks at NIST laboratories in Boulder, Colorado. That's clearly an important job, so the agency has backup generators in case the local grid fails due to, say, an unfortunate weather incident. But there wasn't a backup generator for the backup generator when, last Wednesday, a powerful windstorm knocked out the power in Boulder. The atomic clocks did have a battery backup system that kept them going for a while, but the “atomic ensemble time scale” failed due to a disconnect between some of the clocks and NIST's measurement systems, according to a community email by NIST supervisory physicist Jeffrey Sherman on December 19. “One impact is that the Boulder Internet Time Services no longer have an accurate time reference,” Sherman added. As a result, the U.S. official time slowed by around 4.8 microseconds—a timeframe that is “both big and small at the same time,” Sherman told NPR. NIST, short for the National Institute of Standards and Technology, officially became America's timekeeper in 2007 through the America COMPETES Act. Today, NIST's standard time serves as a reference point for things like telecommunications and GPS signals. The atomic clock ensemble is a mix of hydrogen masers and cesium beam clocks, which produce a weighted average of physical signals that NIST researchers use to keep time. NIST staff was also able to address the issue in a reasonable amount of time. The power outage lasted around two hours, and critical operations staff on duty immediately activated a reserve diesel generator to keep the clocks running. “Additional quick action by NIST facility staff secured temperature control for the most sensitive clocks,” Sherman added in a follow-up community message on Sunday. As of December 21, utility power had returned to NIST's facilities, and “assessment and repair activity is in progress.” Subscribe and interact with our community, get up to date with our customised Newsletters and much more.

But now, Anna's Archive is turning its attention to music, starting with Spotify. “This Spotify scrape is our humble attempt to start such a ‘preservation archive' for music,” the people behind Anna's Archive wrote in a blog post. According to the post, the group discovered some time ago how to scrape Spotify at scale and decided it was in a position to build a music archive focused on preservation. Anna's Archive claims it has backed up metadata for 256 million tracks and audio files for about 86 million of them. Most of the files were scraped before July 2025, meaning newer releases may be missing. For instance, it estimates that Spotify's top three songs have more combined streams than the bottom 20 to 100 million tracks put together. The non-profit acknowledged that music is already being preserved in various ways, but said many existing efforts have major shortcomings. Anna's Archive said the files will be released in phases, starting with metadata, followed by audio files (shared in order of popularity) and then album art. “With your help, humanity's musical heritage will be forever protected from destruction by natural disasters, wars, budget cuts, and other catastrophes,” the project's blog read. “Spotify has identified and disabled the nefarious user accounts that engaged in unlawful scraping. We've implemented new safeguards for these types of anti-copyright attacks and are actively monitoring for suspicious behavior,” a Spotify spokesperson told Gizmodo in an emailed statement. “Since day one, we have stood with the artist community against piracy, and we are actively working with our industry partners to protect creators and defend their rights.” "Prompted Playlists" are currently only available in New Zealand. AI videos move aside, there is new eerily realistic slop in town. If you make it (a monetized in-app video player), they will come.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Starcloud CEO Philip Johnston said his company has already worked out a contract along those lines with Denver-based Crusoe Cloud, a strategic partner. “In the long term, you can think of this more like an energy provider,” he told GeekWire. “We tell Crusoe, ‘We have this box that has power, cooling and connectivity, and you can do whatever you want with that. That means we don't have to pay for the chips. He laid out an ambitious roadmap: “The contract is 10 gigawatts of power from 2032 for five years, at 3 cents per kilowatt-hour. Putting the pieces in place for that business is a primary focus for Redmond, Wash.-based Starcloud, which was founded in 2024 by Johnston, chief technology officer Ezra Feilden and chief engineer Adi Oltean. The leading companies in AI — including OpenAI, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta — are spending hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers that are increasingly hungry for square footage, electrical power and cooling capacity. That has led the titans of AI, and startups like Starcloud and Sophia Space, to look toward Earth orbit as the next frontier. Using the Nvidia chip, Starcloud trained a large language model called NanoGPT, a feat that hadn't been done in space before. (For example, “They can it like you from me speak.”) Starcloud-1 produced better results with a pre-trained version of Gemma, an open-source AI model from Google. When asked for its first statement, Gemma responded with “Greetings, Earthlings! Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, who is now executive chairman and CEO of Relativity Space, said in a post to X that Gemma's performance was “a seriously cool achievement.” Coming up with orbital witticisms is only the beginning. “We're also going to be running some more practical workloads,” Johnston said. Next year, Starcloud-1's Nvidia H100 chip will start analyzing synthetic-aperture radar data from Capella Space's satellite constellation. “The idea is that we can draw insights from that data on orbit and not have to wait a few days to downlink all that data over very slow RF ground-station links,” Johnston said. Starcloud-2 is due for launch next October, with about 100 times the power-generating capability of its predecessor. It will carry multiple H100 chips and Nvidia's more advanced Blackwell B200 chip. “We're also flying some on-premises hardware from one of the big hyperscalers. I can't say exactly who yet,” Johnston said. “From there, we scale up to Starcloud-3, which is about a 2-ton, 100-kilowatt spacecraft that will launch on the Starship ‘Pez Dispenser' form factor,” he said. The satellites would travel in a globe-girdling “train,” with data transmitted from one satellite to the next one via laser links. “We just basically have a laser fixed [on each satellite], and then we very slightly adjust with a very finely tuned mirror. “We've raised about $34 million as of today,” Johnston said. The company is likely to be looking for a bigger facility next year. Over the past year, industry observers have been debating whether orbital data centers could really offer a better value proposition than terrestrial data centers. Johnston noted that Google recently announced an AI-in-space moonshot called Project Suncatcher, “which is exactly what we're doing.” “They're paying Planet Labs to do a demo in 2027, and as I understand it, the demo they're doing in 2027 is less powerful than the one we've got in orbit — so we have a massive head start against all of those guys, AWS and SpaceX being the exceptions,” Johnston said. “I think we become an interesting partner for some of those folks,” he added. “And I don't mean an acquisition target necessarily. “There are many different places you can put them, further away from Earth,” Johnston said.

The shadow library, who labels itself as archivists, has apparently scraped nearly the entirety of the platform, downloading roughly 300 TB of music that is now being distributed illegally via torrents. "An investigation into unauthorized access identified that a third party scraped public metadata and used illicit tactics to circumvent DRM to access some of the platform's audio files. That "some" in the above comment is key because the leaked collection consists of around 86 million files in particular, representing ~37% of all music available on the platform (but 99.9% of listens). Most of them are preserved in Spotify's original OGG Vorbis 160 kbps format, but if any song has a popularity rating of exactly 0, then they've been re-encoded to 75kpbs to save space. With that, there's 256 million rows of metadata that accounts for 99.6% of all listens on Spotify and it has been complied into query-able SQL databases. The group has done a near-lossless JSON reconstruction of Spotify's API, including 186 million unique ISRCs. The blog post released by Anna's Archive going over this leak is surprisingly informative, including a bunch of charts that break down how Spotify treats music in general. Anyhow, the reason for this large-scale hack, as described by Anna's Archive itself, is preservation of music. Since the group is notorious for open-sourcing books without consent, it's applying much of the same logic here, arguing that Spotify's collection is too overtly focused on popular artists and sound quality.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Known as the “Doomsday Glacier,” the Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica is one of the most rapidly changing glaciers on Earth, and its future evolution is one of the biggest unknowns when it comes to predicting global sea level rise. A new study by the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC) presents a detailed record of this gradual collapse process. Researchers at the Centre for Earth Observation and Science at the University of Manitoba, Canada, analyzed observational data from 2002 to 2022 to track the formation and propagation of cracks in the ice shelf shear zone. A fast-motion video of Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica over a period of about 10 years. Some exceeded 8 km in length and spanned the entire shelf. Analysis of satellite images showed that the total length of the cracks increased from about 165 km in 2002 to approximately 336 km in 2021. Meanwhile, the average length of each crack decreased from 3.2 km to 1.5 km, with a notable increase in small cracks. These changes reflect a significant shift in the stress state of the ice shelf, that is, in the interaction of forces within its structure. Between 2002 and 2006, the ice shelf accelerated as it was pulled by nearby fast-moving currents, generating compressive stress on the anchorage point, which initially stabilized the shelf. According to researchers, this has accelerated the upstream flow of ice and turned the anchorage into a destabilizing factor. These changes advanced at a rate of approximately 55 kilometers per year within the ice shelf, demonstrating that structural collapse in the shear zone directly impacts upstream ice flow. Time-series analysis of shear deformation rates, based on satellite data, also showed a sharp increase during that same winter. Between 2002 and 2006, the ice was in a state of extensive tension, stretching in the direction of flow. Subsequently, it transitioned to a state of compressive tension, and since 2020, it has returned to an extensive state. The researchers caution that the deterioration patterns observed in this study could apply to other ice shelves undergoing similar weakening processes. Because the Thwaites Glacier sits on a reverse-slope bed, where the ocean floor dips inland, once retreat begins it is likely to progress toward irreversible collapse. The glacier's total mass is sufficient to raise sea levels by about 65 centimeters, and previous numerical models estimate that the baseline of the ice sheet and shelf will retreat at a rate of nearly 1 kilometer per year over the next 40 years. These results help us understand the future of other ice shelves in Antarctica and provide key data for validating numerical collapse models. For now, all indications are that the weakening of the Thwaites Glacier ice shelf will continue to accelerate. This article originally appeared in WIRED Japan and has been translated from Japanese.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As far as marketing goes, being able to announce (as Grado can) that your headphones are “hand-assembled in Brooklyn, USA” is not to be sniffed at. They sound amazing, but a few small issues with fit leave a bit to be desired, which isn't something you'd expect from $1,650 audiophile headphones. Still, if you're the right type of listener, these high-end headphones present music in as pristine a manner as a nice pair of stereo speakers in a good room. All that's very good indeed about these new Grado headphones concerns the way they sound. It claims these drivers are good for a frequency response of 6 Hz to 46 kHz, which is a massive tonal range for any headphones. The new “B” ear cushions Grado has designed for the Signature S750 have a noticeably flat surface. It also allows the diaphragm itself to be much closer to the listener's ear than is usual, and it features a smaller-than-usual interior opening to finesse the sonic balance. No matter the sort of stuff you choose to listen to—for the purposes of this test I tried a bit of everything, from “Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten” by Arvo Pärt to “Honey Power” by My Bloody Valentine, via “The Universe Will Take Care of You” by James Holden and Waclaw Zimpel—the Signature S750 are seemingly impossible to rattle. I plugged the headphones into a Naim amplifier being fed by both a Technics record player and a Cambridge network streamer, an expensive iFi headphone amplifier, and an only slightly more affordable FiiO digital audio player, and these headphones make the absolute best of all of it. If we're judging purely on sound quality, the Grado Signature S750 are among the best pound-for-pound headphones you can currently buy. A big part of what's so straightforwardly enjoyable about them is the balance and poise they demonstrate. Tonally they're utterly lifelike, uncolored, and convincing. Frequency response is similarly even-handed and naturalistic. The headphones sound notably open and spacious even by the standards of expensive open-backed headphones. The soundstage they create is big and airy, but also rigorously controlled and focused at the same time. Even with large ensemble pieces, the Grado make sure that every participant has the elbow room they need. Detail levels are high in every respect. Low-frequency sounds are deep and solid, sure, but they're also loaded with information regarding texture and timbre, with ample variation at every stage. The top of the frequency range carries just as much fine detail, and also is substantial enough to prevent any hint of glassiness or hardness even if you're listening at significant volume. With singers, all the minutiae of character and attitude is made available just as readily as the details of tone and technique. There's no sonic stress associated; the Signature S750 can power through the biggest dynamic upheavals without breaking sweat. There's nothing prissy or analytical about them, though. They contextualize a huge amount of information not because it's a party piece, but because they're simply that well designed. When you pay $1,695 (or its equivalent) for a pair of your headphones, there are other criteria to be met. There's very little articulation between the ear cups and the headband, though, and some overzealous clamping force means the Signature S750 are not especially comfortable, even for those of us with heads of unremarkable size. The friction-pole mechanism for headband adjustment is no less agricultural, for all its familiarity where Grado headphone designs are concerned. And while the detachable cable is a fair bit more flexible than some older Grado models, that's not the same as saying it's meaningfully flexible. If there's a more willfully unhelpful length of cable in all of headphone-land, I've yet to encounter it. When you're charging this sort of money for headphones, it's not outlandish to imagine your customer might have a device that accepts a balanced connection. Frankly, why there isn't a choice of cables in the packaging is, frankly, beyond me. It's something that the overwhelming majority of Grado's rivals provide as a matter of course, and though the company's website suggests there are forthcoming cable options “including a variety of lengths, as well as balanced terminations such as 4-pin XLR and 4.4mm,” these have been “forthcoming” for quite some time now, and will have a cost attached. I'm in no position to doubt the effectiveness of the “B” ear cushions where sound quality is concerned. After all, the Signature S750 sound superb, and Grado suggests the cushion design is a contributing factor. What I do feel qualified to say, though, is that the raw-feeling foam of the ear cushions is not especially comfortable, and that it retains and returns the wearer's body heat with something approaching glee. “Premium” and “luxurious” are not words that apply. Ultimately, it depends on what your priorities are. But unless you're one of those hair-shirt hi-fi fundamentalists from back in the day, one of those listeners who somehow doesn't believe outstanding sound quality is valid unless there's some suffering attached, there may well be too many shortcomings to overlook when it comes to these Grados.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you're looking to get more organized in the new year, a planner is a good place to start, and Japanese planners might have caught your eye. Once you start looking into paper planners, it won't take long to start seeing recommendations of cult favorites like the Hobonichi Techo. A primary difference is paper quality, as Japanese planners use thinner, smoother paper that's still strong enough to keep ink leakage between pages at bay, while American planners have thicker paper. You'll also see a different design aesthetic, with Japanese planners leaning more minimalist. There's also more space for you to manually customize your planner in a Japanese version, while American planners tend to come with everything pre-organized. As the resident paper planner tester here at WIRED, I've tried several popular planners from America and Japan alike, and more and more often the Japanese planners have risen to the top. Here's a quick breakdown of the major things you'll notice when shopping for Japanese planners compared to American ones. While popular Japanese planner makers each have their own signature paper, there's a similar experience in writing on some of the most popular planners and notebooks. Compared to American planners, Japanese planners like the Hobonichi and Kokuyo Jibun have much thinner, smoother paper, but both papers are still plenty durable and won't let ink leak through to the other side (you can faintly see the writing on the other side, though). Meanwhile, American paper planners have a cardstock feel to them, and thus American planners with the same number of pages end up much thicker than a Japanese planner. The Hobonichi uses Tomoe River S paper; originally, Hobonichi used regular Tomoe River paper, but after the manufacturer stopped making it, Hobonichi found another manufacturer to make Tomoe River S paper, and the brand has been using it in its planners since 2024. Japanese planners have a much more minimalist design style compared to American ones. Especially when you compare the colorful, youthful designs of American planners like Happy Planner and Ban.do to one like the Hobonichi—the Hobonichi feels very minimalist and plain. There are fun covers you can add onto Japanese planners to make them more your style, while American planners try to guess your style and offer it as an option. Depending on your personal aesthetic, that might be easy to find or quite difficult; I struggle to find a Happy Planner or Ban.do cover, for instance, that feels appropriate for my thirties. You'll also see a lot more grid paper rather than lines or blank spaces, which was a little off-putting for me at first, but I grew to really enjoy how much freedom it gave me to use the space as I liked, and helped me keep my writing tidy versus accidentally writing crooked in an empty box. Granular customization is a popular feature in some American planners. Brands like the Erin Condren LifePlanner are beloved for their ability to allow a user to fully customize what will be printed on each page. This isn't something you'll see in Japanese planners. Instead, you're given more free space to write in your own things like daily habit trackers or a daily schedule, rather than having those sections pre-made for you. You can also build a planner with different workbooks, like the Jibun Techo First Kit, which is reminiscent of refillable Filofax-style systems but with a much cooler aesthetic. If my goals change during the year, I'm not locked into a concept I cooked up in January—it gives me a true fresh start for each month, week, and day spread. I've tried a few different Japanese planners this past year. Here are the ones I'll keep using in 2026. I really like the A5 size, but the regular Techo is a great and affordable place to start if you want to see if Japanese planners are for you. As someone who already has a favorite weekly planner, I was surprised to find myself falling in love with the Kokuyo Jibun Techo. I got the 2026 First Kit, which included the last two months of 2025, so I've already been able to start testing it out in my daily life. Finally, the Ideas notebook in the back is just grid paper where you can write lists and ideas to your heart's content. All three books are interlaid in the cover to sit as one planner, but you can remove one and refill it any time. It's a really handy system, especially as someone who will definitely need to refill the Ideas booklet before the year is up. The Midori notebooks are popular—specifically, those with MD paper. It's described as versatile, and the paper does feel plenty versatile, but it also feels a little thicker and more akin to a regular notebook than the super-thin paper you'll get on a Hobonichi or Kokuyo Jibun planner. I'm testing both the MD Diary and the Stand+ notebook, and I really like how the Stand+ is created to stand up on its own; it makes for a much more fun way to view my to-do list. The Diary has a similar feel to it and a similar design, but instead of grid paper, it has lines. The lines are wide, which is nice if you have large handwriting, but it doesn't feel like enough space for me given how small the notebook is. If you worry that you won't be able to read the Japanese characters in a Japanese planner, good news! For the Jibun, I still have to look up some translations since the descriptions under those titles are in Japanese, but I can usually infer how to use a page from the title and design. JetPens has an entire page dedicated to translating the Jibun Techo here. Get best-in-class reporting and exclusive subscriber content that's too important to ignore.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Will it prove that carbon removal can really help our warming planet? Obsidian caves and jagged stone towers preside over the steam that spurts out of fissures in the soil and wafts from pools of boiling-hot water—produced by magma that, in some areas, sits just a few miles below the surface. It's a landscape born from violent geologic processes some 25 million years ago, when the Nubian and Somalian tectonic plates pulled apart. This volatility imbues the land with vast potential, much of it untapped. The area, no more than a few hours' drive from Nairobi, is home to five geothermal power stations, which harness the clouds of steam to generate about a quarter of Kenya's electricity. But some energy from this process escapes into the atmosphere, while even more remains underground for lack of demand. The longer-term vision is far more ambitious: to prove that direct air capture (DAC), as the process is known, can be a powerful tool to help the world keep temperatures from rising to ever more dangerous levels. “We believe we are doing what we can here in Kenya to address climate change and lead the charge for positioning Kenya as a climate vanguard,” Specioser Mutheu, Octavia's communications lead, told me when I visited the country last year. Some argue that DAC, which uses mechanical and chemical processes to suck carbon dioxide from the air and store it in a stable form (usually underground), is the best way to do that. The idea is that DAC plants like this one will remove and permanently store carbon and create carbon credits that can be purchased by corporations, governments, and local industrial producers, which will collectively help keep the world from experiencing the most dangerous effects of climate change. Now, Octavia and a growing number of other companies, politicians, and investors from Africa, the US, and Europe are betting that Kenya's unique environment holds the keys to reaching this lofty goal—which is why they're pushing a sweeping vision to remake the Great Rift Valley into the “Great Carbon Valley.” And they hope to do so in a way that provides a genuine economic boost for Kenya, while respecting the rights of the Indigenous people who live on this land. But DAC is also a controversial technology, unproven at scale and wildly expensive to operate. In May, an Icelandic news outlet published an investigation into Climeworks, which runs the Mammoth plant, finding that it didn't even pull in enough carbon dioxide to offset its own emissions, let alone the emissions of other companies. Critics also argue that the electricity DAC requires can be put to better use cleaning up our transportation systems, heating our homes, and powering other industries that still rely largely on fossil fuels. And further complicating this picture is shrinking demand from governments and corporations that would be DAC's main buyers, which has left some experts questioning whether the industry will even survive. Carbon removal is a technology that seems always on the verge of kicking in but never does, says Fadhel Kaboub, a Tunisian economist and advocate for an equitable green transition. And many of those remaining don't even have access to the electricity generated by these plants. But if the project can indeed make it through, Benjamin Sovacool, an energy policy researcher and director of the Boston University Institute for Global Sustainability, sees immense potential for countries that have been historically marginalized from climate policy and green energy investment. Though he's skeptical about DAC as a near-term climate solution, he says these nations could still see big benefits from what could be a multitrillion-dollar industry. It's something even an ordinary person can just get,” Sovacool says. “If we're able to do DAC at scale, it could be the next huge energy transition.” But first, of course, the Great Carbon Valley has to actually deliver. The “Great Carbon Valley” is both a broad vision for the region and a company founded to shepherd that vision into reality. Bilha Ndirangu, a 42-year-old MIT electrical engineering graduate who grew up in Nairobi, has long worried about the impacts of climate change on Kenya. So in 2021, Ndirangu cofounded Jacob's Ladder Africa, a nonprofit with the goal of preparing African workers for green industries. She also began collaborating with the Kenyan entrepreneur James Irungu Mwangi, the CEO of Africa Climate Ventures, an investment firm focused on building and accelerating climate-smart businesses. One energy-hungry, climate-positive industry stood out: direct air capture of carbon dioxide. And with nearly 90% of the country's grid already powered by renewable energy, DAC wouldn't be siphoning power away from other industries that need it. So in 2023, the pair founded Great Carbon Valley, a project development company whose mission is attracting DAC companies to the area, along with other energy-intensive industries looking for renewable power. It has already brought on high-profile companies like the Belgian DAC startup Sirona Technologies, the French DAC company Yama, and Climeworks, the Swiss company that operates Mammoth and another DAC plant in Iceland (and was on MIT Technology Review's 10 Breakthrough Technologies list in 2022, and the list of Climate Tech Companies to Watch in 2023). All are planning on launching pilot projects in Kenya in the coming years, with Climeworks announcing plans to complete its Kenyan DAC plant by 2028. GCV has also partnered with Cella, an American carbon-storage company that works with Octavia, and is facilitating permits for the Icelandic company Carbfix, which injects the carbon from Climeworks' DAC facilities. “This is also an opportunity to be entrepreneurial and creative in our thinking, because there are all of these assets that places like Kenya have.” Not only can the country offer cheap and abundant renewable energy, but supporters of Kenyan DAC hope that the young and educated local workforce can supply the engineers and scientists needed to build out this infrastructure. “It's not a one-off industry,” Ndirangu says, highlighting her faith in the idea that jobs will flow from green industrialization. “You're developing a whole range of infrastructure to make this industry possible,” she adds. “People used to write academic articles about the fact that no human will ever be able to run a marathon in less than two hours,” Octavia CEO Martin Freimüller told me that day. Although not an official partner of Ndirangu's Great Carbon Valley venture, Octavia aligns with the larger vision, he told me. It didn't take long for neighbors to complain about the noise, and within six months, the operation had moved to its current warehouse. That same year, they announced their first prototype, affectionately called Thursday after the day it was unveiled at a Nairobi Climate Network event. Soon, Octavia was showing off its tech to high-profile visitors including King Charles III and President Joe Biden's ambassador to Kenya, Meg Whitman. Three years later, the team has more than 40 engineers and has built its 12th DAC unit: a metal cylinder about the size of a large washing machine, containing a chemical filter using an amine, an organic compound derived from ammonia. When that mixture is heated inside a vacuum to 80 to 100 °C, the CO2 is released, now as a gas, and collected in a special chamber, while the amine can be reused for the next round of carbon capture. The amine absorption method has been used in other DAC plants around the world, including those operated by Climeworks, but Octavia's project stands apart on several key fronts. This energy is typically released into the atmosphere, but it will be channeled instead to Octavia's machines. This technology is being tested in the field in Gilgil, where Mutheu told me the company is “continuing to capture and condition CO₂ as part of our ongoing operations and testing cycles.” (She declined to provide specific data or results at this stage.) Once the CO2 is captured, it will be heated and pressurized. Then it will be pumped to a nearby storage facility operated by Cella, where the company will inject the gas into fissures underground. The region's special geology again offers an advantage: Much of the rock found underground here is basalt, a volcanic mineral that contains high concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions. They react with carbon dioxide to form substances like calcite, dolomite, and magnesite, locking the carbon atoms away in the form of solid minerals. This process is more durable than other forms of carbon storage, making it potentially more attractive to buyers of carbon credits, says Pattison, the Cella CEO. Non-geologic carbon mitigation methods, such as cookstove replacement programs or nature-based solutions like tree planting, have recently been rocked by revelations of fraud or exaggeration. The money for Cella's pilot, which will see the injection of 200 tons of CO2 this year, has come mainly from the Frontier advance market commitment, under which a group of companies including Stripe, Google, Shopify, Meta, and others has collectively pledged to spend $1 billion on carbon removal by 2030. These projects have already opened up possibilities for young Kenyans like Wanjau. She told me there were not a lot of opportunities for aspiring mechanical engineers like her to design and test their own devices; many of her classmates were working for construction or oil companies, or were unemployed. But almost immediately after graduation, Wanjau began working for Octavia. “Not many people in Africa get a chance to do that.” Despite the vast enthusiasm from partners and investors, the Great Carbon Valley faces multiple challenges before Ndirangu and Mwangi's vision can be fully realized. Since its start, the venture has had to contend with “this perception that doing projects in Africa is risky,” says Ndirangu. Indeed, Octavia has described itself as the first DAC plant to be located there. Ndirangu says that she's already seen “a real appetite” from power producers who want to build out more renewable-energy infrastructure, but at the same time they're waiting for proof of demand. She envisions that once that power is in place, lots of other industries—from data centers to producers of green steel, green ammonia, and sustainable aviation fuels—will consider basing themselves in Kenya, attracting more than a dozen projects to the valley in the next few years. But recent events could dampen demand (which some experts already worried was insufficient). Global governments are retreating from climate action, particularly in the US. The Trump administration has dramatically slashed funding for development related to climate change and renewable energy. The Department of Energy appears poised to terminate a $50 million grant to a proposed Louisiana DAC plant that would have been partially operated by Climeworks, and in May, not long after that announcement, the company said it was cutting 22% of its staff. At the same time, many companies that would have likely been purchasers of carbon credits—and that a few years ago had voluntarily pledged to reduce or eliminate their carbon emissions—are quietly walking back their commitments. As of mid-December, carbon removal credits in the European Union's Emissions Trading System, one of the world's largest carbon markets, were priced at around $84 per ton. The average price per DAC credit, for comparison, is nearly $450. Natural processes like reforestation absorb millions of tons of carbon annually and are far cheaper (though programs to harness them for carbon credits are beset with their own controversies). Ultimately, DAC continues to operate on a small scale, removing only about 10,000 metric tons of CO2 each year. Even if DAC suppliers do manage to push past these obstacles, there are still thorny questions coming from inside Kenya. Groups like Power Shift Africa, a Nairobi-based think tank that advocates for climate action on the continent, have derided carbon credits as “pollution permits” and blamed them for delaying the move toward electrification. “The ultimate goal of [carbon removal] is that you can say at the end, well, we can actually continue our emissions and just recapture them with this technology,” says Kaboub, the Tunisian economist, who has worked with Power Shift Africa. “So there's no need to end fossil fuels, which is why you get a lot of support from oil countries and companies.” Another problem he sees is not limited to DAC but extends to the way that Kenya and other African nations are pursuing their goal of green industrialization. While Kenyan President William Ruto has courted international financial investment to turn Kenya into a green energy hub, his administration's policies have deepened the country's external debt, which in 2024 was equal to around 30% of its GDP. Geothermal energy development in Kenya has often been financed by loans from international institutions or other governments. Kenya may indeed have advantages over other countries, and DAC costs will most likely go down eventually. But some experts, such as Boston University's Sovacool, aren't quite sold on the idea that the Great Carbon Valley—or any DAC venture—can significantly mitigate climate change. Sovacool's research has found that at best, DAC will be ready to deploy on the necessary scale by midcentury, much too late to make it a viable climate solution. And that's if it can overcome additional costs—such as the losses associated with corruption in the energy sector, which Sovacool and others have found is a widespread problem in Kenya. Cost is “not the most important thing,” says Erin Burns, executive director of Carbon180, a nonprofit that advocates for the removal and reuse of carbon dioxide. “There's lots of things we pay for.” She notes that governments in Japan, Singapore, Canada, Australia, the European Union, and elsewhere are all looking at developing compliance markets for carbon, even though the US is stagnating on this front. The Great Carbon Valley, she believes, stands poised to benefit from these developments. To the Maasai people, nomadic pastoralists who inhabit swathes of Eastern Africa, including Kenya, this land around Lake Naivasha is “ol-karia,” meaning “ochre,” after the bright red clay found in abundance. But for decades most of the Maasai haven't had access to that electricity. Neither Octavia or Cella is powered by output from these two geothermal producers, but activists have warned that similar environmental and social harms could resurface if demand for new geothermal infrastructure grows in Kenya—demand that could be driven by DAC. Ndirangu says she believes some of the complaints about displacement are “exaggerated,” but she nonetheless acknowledges the need for stronger community engagement, as does Octavia. In the long term, Ndirangu says, she plans to provide job training to residents living near the affected areas and integrate them into the industry, although she also says those plans need to be realistic. DAC is a small industry, and it can't do everything. But if it's going to become as big as Ndirangu, Freimüller, and other proponents of the Great Carbon Valley hope it will be, creating jobs and driving Kenya's green industrialization, communities like Koilel's will be among those most directly affected—much as they are by climate change. She wasn't necessarily against geothermal power development on principle, or opposed to any of the industries that might push it to expand. She just wants to see some benefits, like a health center for her community. She wants to reverse the evictions that have pushed her neighbors off their land.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At some point next month, a handful of volunteers will be injected with two experimental gene therapies as part of an unusual clinical trial. His long-term goal: to achieve radical human life extension. The 12 to 15 volunteers—who will be covering their own travel and treatment costs—will receive a series of injections in the muscles of their arms and legs. The company hopes to see improvements in strength, endurance, and recovery. But some experts are concerned that the trial involves giving multiple gene therapies to small numbers of healthy people. It will be impossible to draw firm conclusions from such a small study, and the trial certainly won't reveal anything about longevity, says Holly Fernandez Lynch, a lawyer and medical ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Unlimited Bio's muscle growth therapy is already accessible at clinics in Honduras and Mexico, says Morgunov—and the company is already getting some publicity. And earlier this week, the biohacking influencer Dave Asprey posted an Instagram Reel of himself receiving one of the treatments in Mexico; it was shared with 1.3 million Instagram followers. In the video, Eterna's CEO, Adeel Khan, says that the therapy can “help with vascular health systemically.” “I'm just upgrading my system for a little while to reduce my age and reduce my vascular risk,” Asprey said. Gene therapies typically work by introducing new genetic code into the body's cells. Existing approved gene therapies have typically been developed for severe diseases in which the target proteins are either missing or mutated. But several groups are exploring gene therapies for healthy people. One of these companies is Minicircle, which developed a gene therapy to increase production of follistatin, a protein found throughout the body that has many roles and is involved in muscle growth. The company says this treatment will increase muscle mass—and help people live longer. Anyone can visit the local clinic and receive that therapy, for a reported price of $25,000. Unlimited Bio's Morgunov, a Russian-Israeli computer scientist, was inspired by Minicircle's story. Specifically, he's committed to radical life extension and has said that he could be part of “the last generation throughout human history to die from old age.” He believes the biggest “bottleneck” slowing progress toward anti-aging or lifespan-extending therapies is drug regulation. So he, too, incorporated his own biotech company in Próspera. “A company like ours couldn't exist outside of Próspera,” says Unlimited Bio's chief operating officer, Vladimir Leshko. There, Morgunov and his colleagues are exploring two gene therapies. One of these is another follistatin therapy, which the team hopes will increase muscle mass. The other codes for a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF. This compound is known to encourage the growth of blood vessels. Neither treatment is designed to alter a recipient's DNA, and therefore it won't be inherited by future generations. The combination of the two therapies could benefit healthy people and potentially help them live longer, says Leshko, a former electrical engineer and professional poker player who retrained in biomedical engineering. “We would say that it's a preventive-slash-enhancing indication,” he says. It was approved in Russia over a decade ago to treat lower-limb ischemia—a condition that can cause pain, numbness, and painful ulcers in the legs and feet. Morgunov reckons that around 10,000 people in Russia have already had the drug, although he says he hasn't “done deep fact-checking on that.” He doesn't know how many people have had VEGF gene therapy in Russia. Previous attempts to inject the therapy into the heart, for example, have resulted in edema, a sometimes fatal buildup of fluid. Leshko counters that the VEGF should remain where it is injected, and any other circulation in the body, if it occurs, should be short-lived. And while the therapy has been approved in Russia, there's a reason it hasn't been approved elsewhere, says Ylä-Herttuala: The clinical trials were not as rigorous as they could have been. While “it probably works in some patients,” he says, the evidence to support the use of this therapy is weak. At any rate, he adds, VEGF will only support the growth of blood vessels—it won't tackle aging. Leshko points to a 2021 study in mice, which suggested that a lack of VEGF activity might drive aging in the rodents. “We're convinced it qualifies as a potential longevity drug,” he says. Minicircle, the company selling another follistatin gene therapy, has not published any rigorous clinical trial data. So far, much of the evidence for follistatin's effects comes from research in rodents, says Ylä-Herttuala. Its follistatin therapy, on the other hand, will be delivered via an adeno-associated virus (AAV). They are generally considered to be safer than AAV therapies. AAV therapies, on the other hand, tend to stick around for months, says Ylä-Herttuala. It's debatable whether healthy people should be exposed to these risks, says Fernandez Lynch. The technology “still has serious questions about its safety and effectiveness,” even for people with life-threatening diseases, she says. “If you are a healthy person, the risk of harm is more substantial because it'll be more impactful on your life.” “Over 120,000 humans die DAILY from age-related causes,” he wrote in an email. “Building ‘ethical' barriers around ‘healthy' human (in fact, aging human) trials is unethical.” Morgunov did not respond to a request for comment. In his video, the biohacker influencer Asprey—who has publicly stated that he's “going to live to 180”—described VEGF as a “longevity compound,” and Eterna's CEO Khan, who delivered the treatment, described it as “the ultimate upgrade.” Neither Asprey nor Khan clinic responded to requests for comment. Michael Gusmano, a professor of health policy at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, worries that this messaging might give trial participants unrealistic expectations about how they might benefit. There is “huge potential for therapeutic misconception when you have some kind of celebrity online influencer touting something about which there is relatively sparse scientific evidence,” he says. In reality, he adds, “the only thing you can guarantee is that [the volunteers] will be contributing to our knowledge of how this intervention works.” Morgunov, who is largely bald, has already started to self-experiment with the approach. “That one we think has great potential because injecting gene therapy into the penis sounds exciting,” says Leshko. A protocol for that trial has not yet been finalized, but he imagines it would involve “five to 10” injections. And injecting anything into a penis risks damaging it (although Leshko points out that a similar approach was taken by another company almost 20 years ago). Injecting a VEGF gene therapy into the penis would also risk edema there, Ylä-Herttuala adds. While they aren't perfect, their existence does raise the bar for any potential future therapies—not only do they have to be safe and effective, but they must be safer or more effective than existing ones. No small trial can be definitive, but it could still provide some insight into how these drugs are working. It is possible that the therapies will increase muscle mass, at least, and that this could be beneficial to the healthy recipients, says Ylä-Herttuala. Before our call, he had taken a look at Unlimited Bio's website, which carries the tagline “The Most Advanced Rejuvenation Solution.” “They promise a lot,” he said. The sunshine vitamin could affect your immune system and heart health. But others are using the technology to rescue endangered species.
