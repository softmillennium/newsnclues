                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The move brings the company's total Bitcoin holdings to 11,542 coins, now worth more than $1 billion, according to analytics firm Arkham. The latest purchase continues Trump Media's broader crypto treasury strategy. Earlier in 2025, the company reported around $2 billion in Bitcoin and related digital assets as it increasingly positions itself as a crypto‑focused investment entity. In July, Trump Media announced plans to launch the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, with Crypto.com serving as the exclusive custodian, prime execution agent, staking, and liquidity provider. Yorkville America Digital, LLC was named as the fund's sponsor. JUST IN: 🇺🇸 Trump Media acquired 451 more Bitcoin for $40.3 million. The fund was structured as a Nevada business trust, issuing and redeeming shares in blocks of 10,000 through authorized participants, using cash for creation and redemption. While in-kind transactions were not initially offered, they could be implemented later pending regulatory approval. That being said, the stock saw its stock surge dramatically last week following an unexpected all-stock merger announcement with TAE Technologies, valuing the combined entity at over $6 billion. Shares jumped roughly 42% on Thursday, adding more than half a billion dollars to the Trump family's holdings, climbed another 8.3% on Friday, and rose 3.6% in Monday premarket trading. The merger pivoted TMTG from a social media play into a fusion energy venture, with plans to build nuclear fusion plants to power artificial intelligence operations. TMTG focuses on social networking, streaming through Truth+, and financial services with a FinTech brand Truth.Fi. Bitcoin is currently priced at $89,358, with a 24-hour trading volume of $38 B. Established in 2012, Bitcoin Magazine is the oldest and most established source of trustworthy news, information and thought leadership on Bitcoin.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This has triggered fresh debate over whether institutional players are turning bearish on Ethereum — or simply managing balance-sheet risk. Senior secured convertible notes rank high in repayment priority and often require cash settlement. Selling liquid assets like ETH is a common way to close such obligations. ETHZilla is repositioning itself from a crypto-treasury-driven narrative toward an operating business model centered on RWA tokenization. Ethereum remains part of its balance sheet, but no longer the core investment thesis. From a market perspective, the sale represents mechanical, one-off sell pressure, tied to debt repayment. Regardless, the company's stock price has suffered significantly after today's announcement. Ethereum has traded near the $3,000 level in recent sessions, rebounding from mid-December lows around $2,900 after weeks of sideways and choppy action. Broader risk-asset uncertainty, thin year-end liquidity, and mixed institutional flows have kept ETH range-bound. Other high-profile moves reinforce that institutional behavior around Ethereum remains mixed rather than one-sided. Earlier this month, on-chain data showed Arthur Hayes moving several million dollars' worth of ETH to institutional and centralized venues. By contrast, BitMine Immersion Technologies, associated with Tom Lee, has continued to accumulate ETH aggressively throughout December. BitMine's latest reported purchase occurred on December 22, adding to a growing treasury built during market pullbacks. Overall, ETHZilla's sale was driven by debt obligations and corporate restructuring, not a bearish Ethereum outlook. Recent activity across treasury firms shows a market defined by rebalancing, selective accumulation, and balance-sheet discipline, rather than wholesale institutional selling.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When the Association of British Investigators (ABI) wanted to help members improve accountability and build trust with clients, it turned to Stephenson Harwood for support. We worked together on developing the UK's first-ever UK GDPR Code of Conduct for Investigative & Litigation Support Services - a landmark achievement that sets a new standard for professionalism and ethics in the industry. This milestone demonstrates the sector's commitment to compliance with complex data protection laws and offers practical guidance for investigators navigating the challenges of handling personal data. “The Code gives private investigators clear rules to follow so they stay in line with GDPR,” said Tony Imossi, ABI's head of secretariat and a renowned international investigator. “Our aim was to establish a trust mark in data. Professional investigation is a sector that attracts scrutiny for how it handles personal data in providing its services. The Code guides investigators and agencies on how to carry out detailed investigations while protecting people's privacy and making sure data is used properly and legally.” The impact of the Code has been recognised beyond the investigative sector, with Tony Imossi shortlisted for the prestigious ‘Privacy Champion of the Year 2025' category at the PICCASO Awards. Katie Hewson, a partner and data privacy expert at Stephenson Harwood said: “It has been a great privilege to work with the Association of British Investigators on this very important project, which will play a significant role in setting a new standard for professionalism, ethics, and accountability in the professional investigators sector, as well as positioning the ABI as a model for self-regulation.” Founded in 1913, the ABI is the leading organisation in the UK's largely unregulated investigative industry. It boasts the largest directory of accredited professional investigators in the UK, with members around the world who meet the ABI's stringent membership criteria. The organisation takes a proactive role in promoting self-regulation and accountability among legitimate professional investigators.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's the digital asset treasury bubble in reverse as companies once hellbent on accumulating crypto on their balance sheets turn to digital asset sales in an effort to either prop plunging stock prices or reduce outstanding debt. ETHZilla (ETHZ), a Nasdaq-listed firm focused on building a reserve of the second-largest cryptocurrency, ether ETH$3,033.60, late Friday said it sold $74.5 million worth of tokens from its treasury. The funds from this latest sale are intended to redeem outstanding senior secured convertible notes under the terms of an agreement signed earlier this month, according to a Friday regulatory filing. ETHZ shares were lower by 4% on Monday, and have lost roughly 96% from their August highs. Many public firms that raised funds to buy digital assets earlier this year are now trading below the net asset value (NAV) of their holdings as their stock prices have slumped far more than the value of their underlying crypto. L1 tokens broadly underperformed in 2025 despite a backdrop of regulatory and institutional wins. 2025 was defined by a stark divergence: structural progress collided with stagnant price action. Institutional milestones were reached and TVL increased across most major ecosystems, yet the majority of large-cap Layer-1 tokens finished the year with negative or flat returns.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A bipartisan duo in the U.S. House of Representatives is circulating a draft bill that would streamline tax rules for investors, traders and developers by explaining how they would handle reporting their taxes on staking, low value transactions and wash sales. The proposal aims to modernize the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by eliminating excessive taxation on everyday crypto transactions, addressing “phantom income,” and closing gaps that lawmakers say invite tax abuse. “America's tax code has failed to keep pace with modern financial technology,” said Miller “This bipartisan legislation brings clarity, parity, fairness, and common sense to the taxation of digital assets. It would exempt capital gains tax on low-value stablecoin transactions under $200, provided the tokens are dollar-pegged, actively traded and issued by a federally regulated entity. The bill would also apply longstanding wash sale rules to crypto, preventing traders from harvesting tax losses while keeping similar positions. Additionally, it proposes a mark-to-market accounting election for active digital asset traders, requiring annual recognition of gains and losses based on fair market value. A separate provision applies the “constructive sale” doctrine to crypto, targeting derivative-based hedging strategies that defer tax indefinitely. “Our discussion draft of the Digital Asset PARITY Act takes a targeted approach that provides an even playing field for consumers and businesses alike to benefit from this new form of payment.” L1 tokens broadly underperformed in 2025 despite a backdrop of regulatory and institutional wins. 2025 was defined by a stark divergence: structural progress collided with stagnant price action. This report analyzes the structural decoupling between network usage and token performance. Public consultation on the proposal will occur from February to April 2025, with legislative submissions expected later that year.

Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, has faced bearish sentiment amid a difficult macroeconomic backdrop and tighter liquidity conditions. The GENIUS Act, passed on July 17, establishes a legislative foundation for stablecoins, which benefits the likes of Circle Internet Group CRCL that offers USDC. J.P. Morgan recently launched a tokenized money-market fund on Ethereum, while Italian bank UniCredit issued its first tokenized structured note on a public blockchain. U.S. policy direction under President Donald Trump has further supported the market. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Spring 2025 Regulatory Agenda introduces potential rules, including amendments to Exchange Act Rules to account for the trading of crypto assets on Alternative Trading Systems and national securities exchanges, as well as rules relating to the offer and sale of crypto assets. In September, the Nasdaq filed a Form 19b-4 with the SEC, proposing rule changes that would allow trading of equity securities and exchange-traded products (ETPs) in “tokenized form” (utilizing blockchain technology) on Nasdaq. These developments bode well for digital asset providers like Robinhood HOOD and Figure Technology Solutions FIGR.

This acquisition aligns with broader initiatives by the Infinite Node Foundation (NODE), a nonprofit that acquired the CryptoPunks intellectual property from Yuga Labs in May 2025. NODE's mission focuses on preserving on-chain art and embedding it in major institutions worldwide, turning what began as a 2017 experimental project into preserved cultural heritage. CryptoPunks, launched by Larva Labs as a collection of 10,000 unique 24x24 pixel avatars on Ethereum, predates the ERC-721 standard that formalized NFTs. Initially free to claim for anyone with an Ethereum wallet, the project pioneered profile-picture (PFP) collections and ignited the 2021-2022 NFT boom, where similar series like Bored Ape Yacht Club built fervent communities. Interestingly, MoMA's donation includes eight works from another generative pioneer: Chromie Squiggles from Art Blocks, further cementing early on-chain generative art in museum history. As of late December 2025, the CryptoPunks floor price stands at approximately $76,000-$82,000 (around 20-27 ETH, fluctuating with Ethereum's value), reflecting sustained interest despite market cycles. This institutional validation could spur renewed collector enthusiasm and broader acceptance of NFTs beyond speculation. MoMA's move - placing these digital natives alongside masters like Picasso and Warhol - signals a shift: blockchain provenance, generative algorithms, and community-driven value are now part of art history. The works are viewable on MoMA's website, ensuring accessibility beyond physical walls. In an era where digital culture dominates, CryptoPunks' journey from crypto experiment to museum treasure underscores NFTs' enduring impact on creativity, ownership, and preservation.

Sidus Space Awarded Contract Under Missile Defense Agency's SHIEL... Velo3D Secures Department of War Contract Valued at $32.6M to Eli... Datavault AI (NASDAQ: DVLT) announced on December 22, 2025 the issuance of two U.S. patents covering blockchain-based content licensing, smart-contract verification, and tokenized monetization for digital content and creative works. Following this news, DVLT has declined 12.48%, reflecting a significant negative market reaction. Our momentum scanner has triggered 36 alerts so far, indicating elevated trading interest and price volatility. This price movement has removed approximately $67M from the company's valuation. Trading volume is very high at 3.5x the average, suggesting heavy selling pressure. DVLT showed a -9.24% move pre-news while peers were mixed: INTZ up 2.4%, VRAR, CSAI, USIO and AUID down between -1.72% and -5.87%, suggesting stock-specific dynamics rather than a unified sector trend. Recent AI-tag announcements with broadly constructive business themes have all seen negative 24h price reactions, indicating a pattern of selling into news. Over the past month, Datavault AI has issued multiple AI-related updates, including sports and NIL data monetization initiatives on Dec. 15, 2025, a Dream Bowl Meme Coin distribution timeline on Dec. 11, 2025, and a WBC licensing deal plus a large Scilex Bitcoin equity financing on Nov. 26, 2025. An exclusive smart-contract licensing deal with Wellgistics on Nov. 25, 2025 also expanded use of its patented tech. Despite these developments, each event's 24h move was negative, framing today's patent news against a backdrop of selling on prior AI-tag catalysts. DVLT has an active Form S-3 filed on Oct. 17, 2025 registering up to 5,000,000 common shares for resale by existing holders. The company receives no proceeds from these sales but does highlight risks such as going concern language, near-term financing needs, potential dilution from future issuances, volatility, and a recent history of Nasdaq compliance issues. A negative reaction despite news of two foundational U.S. patents would fit the recent pattern of selling on AI-related announcements, where prior updates all saw negative 24h moves. Investors have also been digesting earlier equity financings and resale capacity under the S-3, which may weigh on sentiment even when IP expands. Such dynamics can lead to volatility as the market balances long-term platform potential against dilution and financing risks. Strengthens Datavault AI's Leadership in AI-Powered Data Valuation and Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization Across Multi-Trillion Dollar Markets PHILADELPHIA, Dec.  22, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via IBN -- Datavault AI Inc. (“Datavault AI” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: DVLT), a pioneer in AI-driven data valuation, monetization, and quantum-encrypted RWA tokenization, today announced the issuance of two key U.S. patents that significantly bolster its intellectual property portfolio in blockchain-based content management and monetization. By combining blockchain immutability with AI-driven valuation and quantum-resistant encryption, Datavault AI is uniquely positioned to tokenize intellectual property, creative content, and data assets as secure RWAs – unlocking fractional ownership, instant settlement, and global liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets. “The issuance of these patents represents a major milestone in our mission to empower creators and enterprises with trusted, scalable data and content monetization,” said Nathaniel T. Bradley, CEO of Datavault AI Inc. “In an era where digital content and data represent trillions in untapped value, our technologies provide the security, transparency, and automation needed to transform intellectual property into tokenized real-world assets. “These patents create significant barriers to entry and robust intellectual property protections for Datavault AI, while also enabling new licensing opportunities. The continued issuance of these patents provides the foundational infrastructure for our Information Data Exchange and forthcoming Elements, NIL, and political exchanges—all built on our exclusive, quantum-secured platform,” stated Joshua Paugh, Chief Intellectual Property Officer of Datavault AI. “This includes quantum chains, quantum-grade encryption, and our unmatched command of AI combined with unprecedented blockchain technologies.” The broader digital content and licensing industry is valued at over $369 billion globally, while real-world asset tokenization has already surpassed $30 billion in on-chain value in 2025, with analysts projecting the global tokenized real world asset market to reach over $16 trillion by 2030. Datavault AI's expanded patent portfolio positions the company at the forefront of these converging markets, enabling secure tokenization of content rights, creative works, and proprietary data as high-value RWAs. The Data Science Division leverages the power of Web 3.0 and high-performance computing to provide solutions for experiential data perception, valuation and secure monetization. Datavault AI's cloud-based platform provides comprehensive solutions serving multiple industries, including HPC software licensing for sports & entertainment, events & venues, biotech, education, fintech, real estate, healthcare, energy and more.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Josip Heit, Senior Strategy Advisor at Apertum Blockchain, has officially announced a strategic expansion initiative aimed at strengthening Apertum's position as a decentralized Layer-1 infrastructure built for accessibility, transparency, and long-term adoption. The announcement comes amid a broader shift in the blockchain industry, as major financial institutions transition from early skepticism to active participation in digital asset ecosystems. This finding places Apertum among a small percentage of blockchain networks globally recognized for strong technical and security standards. “This expansion reflects a critical phase in blockchain industry evolution,” said Heit. “As the industry matures, Apertum's focus remains on building infrastructure that is secure, transparent, and accessible to real-world users — not just early adopters or institutions.” Heit's announcement traces the evolution of blockchain technology, contrasting the early days of Bitcoin and Ethereum with Apertum's mission to create a more inclusive and accessible blockchain ecosystem. Heit explained that both shared a key trait in their early days: they were designed for the few. “Bitcoin in 2009 had no price, no exchanges, just a whitepaper, a few cypherpunks in forums, and a small group of early adopters running code on their laptops,” said Heit.“They were built by the technical, the nerds, the early adopters who knew where to find GitHub links and forum posts. In contrast, Apertum's early phase has taken a different direction by focusing on accessibility rather than reserving the blockchain for elite miners. The team at Apertum asked, “What if the first years of a blockchain were designed to onboard everyday people, businesses, and communities through tools they can easily understand?” This approach ensures that blockchain technology is accessible to everyone, even those with zero technical knowledge. Statements such as “Bitcoin is a fraud” (JPMorgan), “rat poison squared” (Warren Buffett), and “money laundering” (BlackRock) reflected early resistance to digital assets. “As we move from defamation to adoption, this shift marks the inevitable mainstreaming of crypto,” said Heit. Now, we are in the quiet adoption phase, it's still early.” In 2025, under Heit's strategic advisor, Apertum transitioned from concept to live ecosystem, integrating with partners, rolling out dApps, and growing a user base focused on organic growth and long-term sustainability. For less than a year from launch, Apertum has processed over 7 million transactions, supports 300,000+ unique wallet addresses, and is integrated with CoinMarketCap. Its native token, $APTM, is currently listed on major exchanges including MEXC, BingX, BitMart, and Poloniex. Apertum combines over 15 years of crypto history, learning from past mistakes and refusing to repeat them. The project prioritizes accessibility over hardware dominance, focusing on a hybrid ecosystem where participation and rewards are driven by active contributions, not just technical resources. Apertum's recent audit by CertiK identified no vulnerabilities — a rare outcome among Layer-1 networks. This result reinforces the platform's architectural focus on decentralization and operational integrity. Apertum's development remains independent of venture capital or institutional funding, focusing solely on organic growth and DAO-led governance to maintain its decentralized and transparent approach. “We're building infrastructure that works — for users, developers, and businesses navigating the shift from traditional systems to decentralized frameworks.” Built on Avalanche's subnet technology, it provides high performance, scalability, and long-term sustainability.
