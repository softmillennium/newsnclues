            Earlier this month, after President Donald Trump blasted “60 Minutes” for interviewing Marjorie Taylor Greene, correspondents noticed a change behind the scenes.
    


            “Bari Weiss got personally involved,” specifically with stories about politics, a source at the program told CNN.
    


            It was her prerogative as the new editor-in-chief of CBS News, and some conservative critics of the CBS newsmagazine would probably say it was necessary. But her presence prompted concern among “60 Minutes” journalists — and perhaps now the program's viewers are finding out why.
    


            Over the weekend, Weiss sparked a crisis inside “60 Minutes” by shelving Sharyn Alfonsi's report about Venezuelan men deported by the Trump administration to a notorious maximum-security prison in El Salvador.
    


            Alfonsi said in an internal memo that “the public will correctly identify this as corporate censorship.” Weiss, who reports directly to Paramount CEO David Ellison, pushed back by saying the story was “not ready.”
    


            Weiss also said in a statement, “I look forward to airing this important piece when it's ready.”
    


            In the meantime, there is a sudden surge of audience interest in the prison, known as CECOT, and the allegations of abuse there. Human Rights Watch said last month that “many of these abuses constitute torture under international human rights law.”
    


            Let's walk through the timeline of how this controversy unfolded.
    


            Alfonsi's story, titled “INSIDE CECOT,” was many weeks in the making. Weiss first screened the segment on Thursday night, two CBS News sources told CNN. She had some notes for the producers, but the story moved forward.
    


            In total, the story “was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices,” Alfonsi wrote in her memo. “It is factually correct.”
    


            Come Friday, the staff thought the story was ready to go. Alfonsi taped her introductory remarks. Executive producer Tanya Simon gave CBS News PR the green light to publicize the segment. “60 Minutes” segments are announced in advance, usually on Fridays, for promotional purposes.
    


            And that's why the next turn of events generated so much turmoil inside the network news division.
    


            On Saturday morning, Weiss messaged Simon with additional concerns about the story, two CBS sources told CNN. One of the main issues was the lack of a response from the Trump administration to the reporting. She also “took issue with the phrasing of ‘migrant detainees,'” one of the sources said.
    


            Of course, that's Weiss's prerogative as the top editor. But everyone at CBS News knows how “60 Minutes” works — how the pieces are screened, when the PR listings are sent out, what the rigorous internal processes are like. Alfonsi had already flown home to Texas by the time Weiss insisted on changes, a CBS source said.
    


CBS shelves ‘60 Minutes' story on Trump deportees at the last minute: ‘People are threatening to quit,' staffers say



            The reporter told colleagues that she “learned on Saturday” that Weiss “spiked our story.” Alfonsi and producer Oriana Zill de Granados then “asked for a call to discuss her decision. She did not afford us that courtesy/opportunity.”
    


            Weiss has not responded directly to that charge.
    


            The change in plans was not finalized until Sunday, hours before airtime, one of the CBS sources said. A planned segment by Jon Wertheim was slotted into Alfonsi's place. A CBS spokesperson shared the revised schedule and stated, “Our report ‘Inside CECOT' will air in a future broadcast.”
    


            Some newsroom staffers had already heard about the abrupt change and had sent Alfonsi worried messages. Others read about the scheduling change and were astonished — even more so after Alfonsi's memo made the rounds.
    


            The correspondent's account of “political” interference sounded like the earth-shattering moment that staffers have feared all year as Ellison moved to take over Paramount.
    


            Ellison has publicly praised “60 Minutes” and spoken optimistically about restoring trust in the news media. But his hiring of Weiss rankled some at CBS, given her lack of TV expertise and traditional reporting experience.
    


            Alfonsi's memo made its way to news outlets, including The New York Times and CNN, ensuring widespread criticism of the decision to shelve the story.
    


            Weiss then pushed back on Sunday night by saying in a statement, “My job is to make sure that all stories we publish are the best they can be. Holding stories that aren't ready for whatever reason — that they lack sufficient context, say, or that they are missing critical voices — happens every day in every newsroom. I look forward to airing this important piece when it's ready.”
    


            It's unclear when that will be. However, it means Weiss is at odds with her own producers and editors in a visceral way. “People are threatening to quit over this,” one of the CBS sources told CNN.
    


            On Monday morning's CBS editorial call, Weiss seemed frustrated about the leaks but confident in her decision. “The only newsroom I'm interested in running is one in which we are able to have contentious disagreements about the thorniest editorial matters with respect, and, crucially, where we assume the best intent of our colleagues. Anything else is absolutely unacceptable,” she said, according to CBS.
    


            “I held a 60 Minutes story because it was not ready,” she continued. “While the story presented powerful testimony of torture at CECOT, it did not advance the ball — the Times and other outlets have previously done similar work. The public knows that Venezuelans have been subjected to horrific treatment at this prison. To run a story on this subject two months later, we need to do more. And this is ‘60 Minutes.' We need to be able to get the principals on the record and on camera.”
    


            Reading between the lines, Weiss confirmed her insistence on adding Stephen Miller or another Trump official voice to the story. But Alfonsi's team did ask for comment, and “their refusal to be interviewed” was “a tactical maneuver designed to kill the story,” Alfonsi wrote in the memo. “If the administration's refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch' for any reporting they find inconvenient.”
    


            Weiss said on the Monday morning call, “Our viewers come first. Not the listing schedule or anything else. That's my north star and I hope it's yours, too.”
    


            But this begs the question: Why were the listings sent out, then? Why did the story get promoted on social media? Some CBS staffers are now asking whether Weiss was pressured by Paramount or by the Trump administration to hold the story once it was publicized.
    


            Trump hasn't just griped about “60 Minutes” this month — he has vented specifically about the Ellisons. He did it again on Friday night at his rally in North Carolina. “I love the new owners of CBS,” Trump said. “Something happens to them, though. ‘60 Minutes' has treated me worse under the new ownership… they just keep hitting me, it's crazy.”
    


            Those complaints haven't occurred in a vacuum. They've come as Paramount publicly argues that it has the inside track for government approval of its bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, CNN's parent.
    


            The “60 Minutes” crew came under tremendous pressure last season as the old Paramount owners were trying to get a deal done with Ellison. That same staff now perceives it's happening again with the new owners.
    


            And outside media observers notice, too. “It's hard to ignore that this happened just as Paramount's hostile bid for Warner Bros. was slipping away, with Kushner pulling out of the financing and Trump bad-mouthing CBS,” wrote The American Prospect's executive editor David Dayen. “Time to please the king again.”
    


New CBS News Era



            Weiss defenders have insisted this episode is being blown out of proportion. But those defenders are relatively quiet compared to alarmed CBS staffers, some of whom are drawing comparisons to the time Mike Wallace's interview with a tobacco industry whistleblower was shelved by corporate. (That real-life drama was immortalized in Michael Mann's 1999 film, “The Insider,” starring Al Pacino and now streaming on Hulu.)
    


            As veteran media reporter Bill Carter observed overnight, “This decision is sure to have ripple effects.”
    


            If CBS will only run a story if the White House grants an interview, “giving them veto power over journalism, any staff member with integrity will likely quit, because it isn't a news division anymore. It's TASS,” Carter wrote, referring to Russia's state news agency.
    


            On the other hand, as a CBS staffer texted CNN on Monday, reporters now have “direct access” to their audience, so the news can get out, one way or another. “There's NO stopping reporting,” they said.

SpaceX's Starship test-flight explosion earlier this year posed a greater danger to commercial aircraft than was publicly disclosed, with passenger planes forced into fuel emergencies and air-traffic controllers intervening to avoid potential collisions, according to FAA documents reviewed by the Wall Street Journal.

The rocket was launched from a company facility in Texas on January 16, failed mid-flight, and broke apart, sending burning fragments streaking across the sky. SpaceX founder Elon Musk commented at the time that “success is uncertain, but entertainment is guaranteed!”

In an article published on Saturday, the Wall Street Journal cited an FAA document stating that “the explosion rained fiery debris across parts of the Caribbean region for roughly 50 minutes,” warning that a debris strike on an aircraft could have had catastrophic consequences, including severe damage and loss of life.

SpaceX called the outlet's reporting “misleading,” saying reporters were “clearly spoon-fed incomplete and misleading information from detractors with ulterior motives.” In a post on X on Saturday, the company said public safety remains its top priority.

“No aircraft have been put at risk, and any events that generated vehicle debris were contained within pre-coordinated response areas developed by the US Space Force and implemented by the FAA,” the company said.

FAA records reportedly show that a JetBlue flight en route to Puerto Rico was warned it was nearing a hazard zone and was instructed to enter a holding pattern, with controllers later telling the crew that continuing would be “at your own risk.” One FAA report said two aircraft flew too close to one another, prompting controller intervention to prevent a potential collision.

Air-traffic controllers allegedly described the situation as a “potential extreme safety risk.” After declaring fuel emergencies, the aircraft – along with an Iberia passenger flight and a private jet – transited the temporarily restricted airspace. All three flights, carrying roughly 450 people, eventually landed safely.

Algeria's parliament has opened debate on a draft law that would criminalize more than 130 years of French colonial rule in the North African country, a move reflecting deep historical grievances and intensifying tensions with Paris.

Ibrahim Boughali, speaker of the People's National Assembly, Algeria's lower house, presented the bill during a plenary session on Saturday, where lawmakers discussed its framework ahead of a vote expected on December 24. 

“The issue of criminalizing colonialism is a cause for the entire nation,” Boughali said, describing the proposal as a “defining milestone in modern Algeria.” 

In a speech during the debate, Abdelmalek Tachrift, the minister for independence war veterans and their families, said the proposed measure showed Algeria would not “compromise” on its national memory or accept any challenge to what it calls the country's historical facts. 

“This qualitative step … embodies the condemnation of a defunct colonial system based on oppression and injustice, and at the same time confirms that victorious Algeria will never … accept any tampering with or relinquishment of the facts of its history,” the minister said.

The draft comes amid a growing reparations' drive across Africa, with the African Union calling for slavery, colonialism, and racial segregation to be recognized and criminalized.

France colonized Algeria from 1830 until the African state won independence in 1962 after a bloody war and years of repression. Relations between Algiers and Paris have soured in recent years over disputes including Western Sahara and historical memory.

France has acknowledged responsibility in specific cases linked to the war in Algeria, including the 2018 admission by President Emmanuel Macron that the state bore responsibility for the torture and death of Algerian nationalist Maurice Audin. Paris has stopped short of issuing a full, official apology for the broader history of colonial-era abuses.

According to local media, the proposed legislation seeks to classify crimes committed during the 132-year period of French rule, including killings, forced deportations, discrimination, torture, and nuclear testing, as crimes against humanity.

MOSCOW, December 22. /TASS/.

Chuck Schumer announces he is introducing resolution to force Senate to initiate legal action against justice department for ‘blatant disregard of law'

Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer announced Monday morning he is introducing a resolution to force the Senate to initiate legal action against the justice department for refusing to release the complete Epstein files.

“I am introducing a resolution directing the Senate to initiate legal action against the DOJ for its blatant disregard of the law in its refusal to release the complete Epstein files,” Schumer posted on social media. “The American people deserve full transparency, and Senate Democrats will use every tool at our disposal to ensure they get it. This Administration cannot be allowed to hide the truth.”

Trump's FBI director Kash Patel is using a fleet of armoured luxury BMW X5s that he requested the agency purchase for his travel, MS Now reports, in Patel's latest questionable use of taxpayers dollars.

Patel, who is already facing a House investigation for his alleged misuse of taxpayer funds, pressed for the vehicles so he could be less “conspicuous” on his outings, four sources familiar with his transportation told the outlet.

FBI directors, who are protected by a security detail, typically travel in Chevrolet Suburbans, though the US government does use the same class of BMWs to protect state department officials and diplomats in high-risk international areas around the world.

Former justice department official Stacey Young, told MS Now that the BMW request was another example of Patel putting his public image ahead of concern for taxpayer resources, calling it “an embarrassment”. She added:

He needs a field jacket that fits just right, a ‘Punisher'-inspired challenge coin and a new fleet of foreign cars to drive around in.

Defending the choice to MS Now, FBI spokesperson Ben Williamson said the BMWs were chosen because they were more cost-effective than other upgraded vehicles the agency could've purchased. Without disclosing how much they cost, he said the move was “evaluated partly as a way to save taxpayers millions by picking cheaper selections or making cost structures more efficient”.

Patel has come under fire for his taxpayer expenses, including taking personal trips on the FBI's Gulfstream private jet for a date night his girlfriend Alexis Wilkins and reportedly hiring a FBI security detail for her.

Donald Trump, defense secretary Pete Hegseth and Navy secretary John Phelan are scheduled to make an announcement at 4:30pm ET from Palm Beach, Florida.

The White House hasn't provided details, and Reuters is reporting that it'll be a “shipbuilding announcement”. When we get further clarity, we'll let you know here.

It follows Trump's signing of a $900bn defense policy bill last week and against a backdrop of escalating tensions between the United States and Venezuela. The US is currently in active pursuit of a third oil tanker accused of carrying Venezuelan oil, NBC News reported last night. “It is flying a false flag and under a judicial seizure order,” an official told the outlet.

In an interview with NBC News last week, Trump left the possibility of war with Venezuela on the table. The US military has killed more than 100 people in strikes on alleged drug boats in the region and seized two oil tankers off Venezuela's coast, as part of Trump's campaign to isolate and pressurize Nicolás Maduro's regime.

CNN reports that some CBS staffers are “threatening to quit” over the controversial cancellation of a 60 Minutes investigation into the brutal CECOT prison in El Salvador where the Trump administration has deported hundreds of migrants.

Editor-in-chief Bari Weiss's decision to pull the story – taken last night three hours before broadcast - has been blasted by members of Congress and the veteran correspondent involved, Sharyn Alfonsi, who had interviewed people deported by the Trump administration to the notorious mega-prison about the “brutal and torturous conditions” they faced.

The New York Times reported that Weiss had seen the segment on Thursday and raised questions about it to its producers, asked for new material to be added, and suggested a new interview with White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the rightwing architect of Trump's anti-immigration policy.

The NYT also reported that Weiss questioned the use of the term “migrants” to describe the approximately 252 Venezuelan men who were deported on flights to El Salvador's Cecot in March and April this year.

CBS said in a statement that the story “needed additional reporting” and will air at a later date.

Alfonsi said in a private note to her CBS colleagues yesterday that the episode “was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices. It is factually correct. In my view, pulling it now, after every rigorous internal check has been met, is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.”

Elsewhere in the note, Alfonsi said her team had requested comment from the White House, the state department, and the Department of Homeland Security. “If the administration's refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch' for any reporting they find inconvenient,” she said.

“We have been promoting this story on social media for days. Our viewers are expecting it. When it fails to air without a credible explanation, the public will correctly identify this as corporate censorship. We are trading 50 years of ‘gold standard' reputation for a single week of political quiet.”

“I care too much about this broadcast to watch it be dismantled without a fight,” she wrote.

Weiss, whose appointment sparked controversy among some CBS journalists who feared its owners were taking the network in a more conservative direction, said in a statement: “My job is to make sure that all stories we publish are the best they can be. Holding stories that aren't ready for whatever reason – that they lack sufficient context, say, or that they are missing critical voices – happens every day in every newsroom. I look forward to airing this important piece when it's ready.”

Furthermore, RADAR online, which filed suit eight years ago after the FBI failed to disclose Epstein investigative files under an April 2017 public records request, noted that the Epstein Files Transparency Act didn't spell out what happens if DOJ officials don't follow the law.

“There is no mechanism for non-compliance in the Act. Some members of Congress have suggested impeachment is the appropriate remedy,” the spokesperson said.

Radar online pointed out that court intervention could help with disclosure in some capacity.

“There remains a possible legal avenue to get withheld files if the DOJ doesn't act,” the spokesperson said. “To the extent the files overlap with Radar's FOIA request we will be able to challenge an incomplete or overly redacted production.”

A hearing is scheduled in Radar's lawsuit on 28 January.

As Donald Trump's justice department faces ongoing criticism for its lackluster rollout of the Epstein files – and mysterious removal of some documents – public records experts are weighing in.

Roy Gutterman, director of the Newhouse School's Tully Center for Free Speech at Syracuse University in New York, said:

This document dump, I believe, does little to clear things up and now that files are disappearing or being so heavily redacted that they are useless.

“It is not too surprising that things might not be fully released or might be withheld, less out of concern for privacy of the victims, but more for political purposes,” he said. Gutterman initially commented before missing documents were re-released, and said later he believes his statements still stand.

Journalists, investigators, and generally concerned citizens have a right to records produced and held by public agencies, with few exceptions, and can seek legal redress if they're not provided within a specific time period.

This slow trickle of Epstein documents, which is in contravention of the law passed mandating that Trump's DOJ release all Epstein files by 19 December, also raises questions about these papers' intersection with the traditional public records laws that protect this right to access.

“These documents are a little outside the normal area for traditional public records reporters seek and uncover through freedom of information laws, which are part of the bedrock of our democracy and an important tool for understanding how government operates,” Gutterman said.

“When I was a reporter, I frequently used public records laws to get documents for stories, and some agencies were a lot more responsive than others. As skeptical as I was … I rarely felt that a records request was being denied for political purposes. But that was a long time ago in a universe far away,” he continued.

The Epstein records are different because they are part of a government investigation and include grand jury documents and some documents with legitimately private information about victims. Plus, the release was compelled by Congress. So, this is a very different type of public records case. But we know that.

If an agency doesn't follow through, by abusing claims of exceptions, those seeking records can fight it in court “if the requester has the time and resources to litigate”, he said.

Sometimes withholding can be for perfectly legitimate reasons. But sometimes a court will need to make decisions.

The prime ministers of Denmark and Greenland have demanded respect for their borders after Donald Trump appointed a special envoy to the largely self-governing Danish territory, which he has said repeatedly should be under US control.

“We have said it very clearly before. Now we say it again. National borders and the sovereignty of states are rooted in international law … You cannot annex other countries,” Mette Frederiksen and Jens-Frederik Nielsen said in a joint statement.

The two leaders added that “fundamental principles” were at stake. “Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders, and the US should not take over Greenland,” they said. “We expect respect for our common territorial integrity.”

Trump on Sunday appointed the governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, as US special envoy to the vast, mineral-rich Arctic island. The US president has on several occasions said the US needs to acquire Greenland for security reasons, while refusing to rule out the use of force. The US president wrote on social media:

Jeff understands how essential Greenland is to our National Security, and will strongly advance our Country's Interests for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Allies, and indeed, the World.

Landry, a former state attorney general who took office as Louisiana governor in January 2024, thanked Trump, saying it was “an honour to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the US”.

Denmark's foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, told Danish television today that he would summon Washington's ambassador to Copenhagen, Ken Howery, to the ministry in the coming days “to get an explanation”.

Rasmussen said he was “deeply upset by this appointment of a special envoy”, and “particularly upset” by Landry's statement, which he said Denmark had found “completely unacceptable”.

Members of Congress slammed CBS's eleventh-hour decision to kill a fully reported 60 Minutes investigation into Trump deportees sent to El Salvador's notorious Cecot prison.

Senator from Hawaii Brian Schatz called it “a terrible embarrassment,” writing on X that “if executives think they can build shareholder value by avoiding journalism that might offend the Mad King they are about to learn a tough lesson. This is still America and we don't enjoy bullshit like this.”

Representative from Rhode Island Seth Magaziner said: “Most of the men sent to Cecot had no criminal records. Some never even entered the US illegally (like Andry Hernandez Romero – look him up). If the Trump admin can send these men to a torture prison w no due process they can do it to anyone. That's the truth they don't want told.”

Representative from California Doris Matsui connected the cancellation directly to CBS parent company Paramount's pending merger with Skydance, which requires Trump administration approval:

“This is exactly what happens when broadcasters bend to political pressure,” she said. “CBS pulling a fully reported 60 Minutes segment just 2 hours before airtime – while Paramount pursues a merger requiring Trump administration approval – is a textbook case of self-censorship.”

In the email, Alfonsi wrote:

“If the standard for airing a story becomes ‘the government must agree to be interview,' then the government effectively gains control over the 60 Minutes broadcast. We go from an investigative powerhouse to a stenographer for the state.

These men risked their lives to speak with us. We have a moral and professional obligation to the sources who entrusted us with their stories. Abandoning them now is a betrayal of the most basic tenet of journalism: giving voice to the voiceless.”

Bari Weiss reportedly killed a CBS 60 Minutes investigation into El Salvador's CECOT prison just three hours before it was set to air Sunday night because the White House refused to grant an interview.

In an email to colleagues, correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi blasted the decision, saying the segment on Trump deportees was fully vetted and “pulling it now, after every rigorous internal check has been met, is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.” Alfonsi said that Weiss did not discuss the decision with them to spike the story.

She warned that CBS had effectively given the government a “kill switch” for inconvenient reporting. The story was replaced with another segment on classical musicians.

My colleagues have more on the story here:

Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer announced Monday morning he is introducing a resolution to force the Senate to initiate legal action against the justice department for refusing to release the complete Epstein files.

“I am introducing a resolution directing the Senate to initiate legal action against the DOJ for its blatant disregard of the law in its refusal to release the complete Epstein files,” Schumer posted on social media. “The American people deserve full transparency, and Senate Democrats will use every tool at our disposal to ensure they get it. This Administration cannot be allowed to hide the truth.”

Other reactions from lawmakers after the document release:

Ahead of the weekend, top democrat on the oversight committee Robert Garcia and top Democrat on the judiciary committee Jamie Raskin announced they are examining all legal options after the heavily redacted document dump, which they say violated federal law.

Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer accused the administration of deliberately hiding the truth and said Senate Democrats would work with victims' attorneys to determine what's being withheld.

Before the deadline, five lawmakers from both parties – including Republican senator Lisa Murkowski and Democrat senator Jeff Merkley – had already written to Bondi requesting a briefing on compliance plans.

And on Friday evening, representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez posted on social media “Bondi should resign tonight” and “Everyone involved will have to answer for this”.

After slow rolling the Epstein file release, and failing to drop them all on the 19 December deadline, representatives Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie are moving towards penalties that would hold attorney general Pam Bondi in inherent contempt of Congress.

Speaking on CBS's Face The Nation on Sunday, Khanna said the move would fine Bondi for every day she fails to release the documents, and would only require House approval.

“We only need the House for inherent contempt, and we're building a bipartisan coalition, and it would fine Pam Bondi for every day that she's not releasing these documents,” he said.

The California Democrat added that he'd spoken with survivors who were outraged that their abusers' names remain redacted while their own identities were accidentally released – noting there are 1,200 victims still waiting for accountability.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Online activity shows the Base, headed by alleged Russian asset Rinaldo Nazzaro, sees US and Ukraine as key centers

Amid high-profile arrests in its Spanish cell, the American-born and designated neo-Nazi terrorist group the Base – once a major preoccupation of FBI counter-terrorism efforts – has all but faded from US headlines. But a flurry of online activities shows the group is still active stateside and considers the US an operational nerve center.

Headed by Rinaldo Nazzaro, an ex-Pentagon contractor turned alleged Russian intelligence asset, the Base has been busy of late pursuing European expansion: besides its heavily armed members in Spain, its Ukrainian wing is linked to multiple acts of terrorism inside of the country and claimed the high-profile July assassination of an intelligence officer in Kyiv.

But the Base's online footprint also paints a picture of a more careful, yet active, American presence: videos from November show masked men shooting military-style rifles and pistols in what they claim is an Appalachian forest.

Another June photo, from the same Appalachian cell, shows five armed men in skull masks, holding rifles and brandishing the Base's black flag, while a cell from the mid-Atlantic captures three members performing “sieg heil” salutes, with another from the midwest showing two men firing pistols.

In the shifting political climate of the second Trump administration, where the FBI has openly rerouted resources away from investigations of far-right extremists, the Base appears free to organize and prepare for their stated objective of fomenting an armed insurgency against the US government.

At the same time, its recruitment has continued to funnel through a Russia email address and has not ceased since the 2020 FBI crackdown against it.

Nazzaro has also matched this new American law enforcement environment with emboldened rhetoric.

“Our long-term strategic goal is to accomplish something similar to what al-Qaida and IS accomplished in Syria,” bragged Nazzaro in an audio recording he released in early December over a Russian-controlled app, reviewed by the Guardian. “Form an organized, armed insurgency to take and hold territory. And establish a white homeland which we control and govern.”

Nazzaro concludes, in the same recording, how “only two traditionally white nations currently possess all of these necessary prerequisites … Ukraine and the United States”.

Steven Rai, an analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), who monitors the Base's every online move, described with alarm how Nazzaro's latest words and European actions illustrate its growing ambitions of openly fomenting new US operations.

“Nazzaro's recent statements mark a troubling escalation that has been unfolding over the past several months,” said Rai, who pointed out that Nazzaro initially suggested over the summer Ukraine would be the only country where he was sanctioning attacks.

“More recently, however, he [Nazzaro] has explicitly expanded this endorsement of violence to other contexts, including the United States, where he has called for the establishment of so-called ‘acceleration teams' aimed at destabilizing society and weakening government authority through attacks on critical infrastructure.”

In a post on VKontakte, the Russian knockoff of Facebook where it maintains an account, the Base was explicitly calling for cells to use “targeted attacks on essential infrastructure and resources” which could “contribute to the political fragmentation of the country over time if the attacks remain consistent”.

Its Ukraine cell is seen within the Base as a model of active insurgency against the Ukrainian government, which is more preoccupied with resisting the full-scale Russian invasion. In the US homeland, however, with “access to firearms” and “rugged wilderness terrain”, Nazzaro and the Base believe the same opportunity exists.

Europol and Spanish police, who executed the raid against the Spanish cell in early December, did not say if American authorities had any contact with them during or before their takedown of the Base.

Several sources have told the Guardian that the FBI under Kash Patel has intentionally looked away from far-right extremism, even openly mocking what is statistically the most dangerous domestic terrorist threat facing the US, as merely part of the “woke” agenda.

But Rai thinks Nazzaro's calls for violence against Americans could act as a wake-up call to authorities, who might now have the legal space to crack down on what is designated a terrorist organization in several allied nations.

“[By] providing Base operatives in the United States with explicit strategic guidance centered around violence, Nazzaro may have inadvertently increased the group's exposure to intervention by law enforcement,” he said.

There's reason to believe the Base has also become a broader intelligence and security target in countries with capable spy agencies willing to devote resources at disrupting it. With legitimate questions surrounding its links to Russian sabotage operations – a top security concern among European nations –the Base is no longer considered an obscure American problem.

Along with Spain, there were recent arrests of members in the Netherlands, Belgium and the United Kingdom, with the European Union declaring it a terrorist group in the league of IS and al-Qaida.

Nazzaro's recent audio clip also notably mentions how he saw the instability in “Canada or the European Union” as promising for the Base's recruitment, in his first explicit mention of Canadian activities in years. The former Canadian cell leader of the Base, Patrik Matthews, is currently sitting in a US prison for his part in illegally entering the US and plotting a 2020 terrorist attack on a Virginia gun rights rally, meant to incite a neo-Nazi revolution.

Comments from deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov carried by state news agency

The Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said that Russia is ready to confirm in a legal agreement that it has no intention of attacking either the EU or Nato, according to a report in the state RIA news agency. We have not been able to independently verify these comments yet.

As mentioned in a previous post, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has offered to drop Ukraine's ambition to join Nato in an attempt to show his willingness to reach an agreement to bring about an end to the war.

In return, Zelenskyy and his European allies have been pushing for “article-5-like” security guarantees from Europe and the US, referring to Nato's founding principle that an attack on one member country should be considered as an attack on all.

Last week, American officials reportedly said the US was ready to offer Ukraine Nato-like security guarantees to safeguard an eventual ceasefire in Russia's war on Ukraine.

The Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, reportedly said that Russia is ready to confirm in a legal agreement that it has no intention of attacking either the EU or Nato.

A Russian general has been killed after an explosive device detonated beneath his car, officials said, in what Moscow described as a possible assassination carried out by Ukrainian intelligence services. Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov, the head of the operational training directorate of the Russian armed forces' general staff, died of his injuries, a spokesperson for Russia's Investigative Committee said. Ukraine has not commented on the car bombing, which reportedly took place in Moscow.

The EU Council says it has extended economic sanctions against Russia for six more months, in response to Moscow's ongoing aggression against Ukraine. The measures will remain in force until 31 July 2026, the council said.

Russian state media quoted the Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, as having said on Monday that there was “slow progress” being made over a plan to end the war in Ukraine after talks in Miami. “Slow progress is being observed,” Ryabkov was quoted as saying, after Russia and Ukraine sent negotiators to Miami for separate talks with Donald Trump's envoys Steve Witkoff, and Jared Kushner, the US president's son-in-law and adviser.

There remain several major hurdles in the negotiations, including Vladimir Putin's insistence that Russia control the entire eastern Donbas region as part of any peace deal – which would see Ukraine cede territory it controls.

Thanks for following along today. We are now closing this blog. You can read all our Ukraine coverage here.

In this report, the Guardian's central and eastern European correspondent, Shaun Walker, explores the hostile atmosphere some Ukrainians are facing in Poland, where resentment has been stoked, in part, by disinformation. Here is an extract:

Oleksandr Pestrykov, of the Ukrainian House in Warsaw, said anti-Ukrainian sentiment first appeared online in 2023, with any news article relating to Ukraine on Polish media immediately swamped with negative comments. Some have accused Russian bots of stoking prejudice online, and for a while the online hatred did not seem to make its way into the real world. That, he said, is now changing.

“Until summer this year, this negativity rarely left the bounds of the internet; the complaints we would get from Ukrainians would be sporadic, and similar to the situation before the full-scale war. But starting from summer we've had a pretty large number of people reporting attacks to us, thankfully so far mostly verbal attacks,” he said.

The complicated history between Poland and Ukraine also plays a role, with the massacre of over 100,000 Poles between 1943 and 1945 by Ukrainian nationalists attempting to ensure the Volhynia region did not become part of Poland a frequent talking point. Ukraine has now allowed Poland to exhume the bodies of victims, but work is moving slowly and the topic is an emotive one for many in Poland.

Russian state media has quoted the Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, as having said on Monday that there was “slow progress” being made over a plan to end the war in Ukraine after the talks in Miami.

“Slow progress is being observed,” Ryabkov was quoted as saying, after Russia and Ukraine sent negotiators to Miami for separate talks with Donald Trump's envoys Steve Witkoff, and Jared Kushner, the US president's son-in-law and adviser.

There were no major breakthroughs from the talks as there remain several major sticking points to overcome, although both the US and Ukrainian envoys said the talks had been “productive and constructive”.

Moscow has insisted, for example, that any peace deal must cede to Russia the entire eastern Donbas region, including areas it has not yet occupied. Ukraine sees this as an unacceptable reward for Moscow's aggression. Russian troops continue a slow but grinding advance in the Donbas region, made up of the two heavily industrialised regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.

Prominent Russian assassinations

Russian general Fanil Sarvarov was killed by a car bomb in Moscow on Monday, the latest in a growing list of military officials and pro-war figures to be assassinated since the start of the full-scale invasion in Ukraine.

Reuters has pulled together this summary of the most prominent cases since 2022:

April 25, 2025 - Lieutenant General Yaroslav Moskalik, 59, is killed by a car bomb near Moscow. Moskalik was deputy head of the Main Operations Directorate of the General Staff.

December 17, 2024 - Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, who was chief of Russia's Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Troops, is killed outside a Moscow apartment building along with his assistant when a bomb hidden in an electric scooter goes off.

November 13, 2024 - A bomb planted under a car kills a Russian serviceman in Sevastopol in Russia-annexed Crimea. A Ukrainian security source names him as Valery Trankovsky, a Russian naval captain whom Kyiv accused of war crimes for ordering missile strikes on civilian targets.

October 4, 2024 - Andrei Korotkiy, an employee at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine is killed in a car bomb attack. Ukrainian military intelligence calls him a collaborator and a war criminal.

December 6, 2023 - Illia Kyva, a former Ukrainian lawmaker regarded by Kyiv as a traitor, is shot dead near Moscow.

July 11, 2023 - Russian military officer Stanislav Rzhitsky, who had commanded a submarine in the Black Sea and appeared on a Ukrainian blacklist of alleged war criminals, is shot dead while out on a morning run in the southern city of Krasnodar.

April 2, 2023 - Vladen Tatarsky, a pro-war Russian military blogger, is killed by a bomb concealed in a statuette presented to him by a woman in a St Petersburg cafe.

August 20, 2022 - Darya Dugina, the daughter of a pro-war nationalist figure, is killed by a car bomb in the Moscow region.

Brussels has responded to China slapping duties of up to 42.7 percent on some EU dairy imports, denouncing the move as “unjustified”.

Beijing's salvo on Monday is just the latest in a trade spat with the EU that's affected products from food to electric vehicles.

The Commerce Ministry said the “duty deposits”, ranging from 21.9 percent to 42.7 percent will apply from Tuesday, and affect a range fresh and processed cheese, curd, blue cheese and some milk and cream.

Beijing says it has lodged the duties after concerns from its local dairy industry that EU subsidies have unfairly caused damage to Chinese producers. They have launched a probe. However EU officials reject the allegations.

“Our assessment is that the [Chinese] investigation is based on questionable allegations and insufficient evidence, and that the measures are therefore unjustified and unwarranted,” a European Commission trade spokesman said.

Beijing's probe is being seen as a tit-for-tat measure, after the EU investigated Chinese subsidies on electric vehicles, and then imposed tariffs as high as 45.3% on China-made EVs.

China urged the EU to scrap those tariffs. It has also initiated other probes into European brandy and pork imports which is being seen as a counter move to the EV tax.

Back to the killing of general Fanil Sarvarov this morning, the third such killing of a senior Russian official this year.

As expected, Ukraine has not offered any official comment. It rarely officially admits or claims responsibility for targeted attacks.

Ukrainian intelligence has targeted dozens of Russian military officers and officials since the start of the war, accusing them of war crimes. But, as my colleague, the Guardian's Russian affairs reporter Pjotr Sauer writes, little is known about the clandestine Ukrainian resistance cells believed to be behind such assassinations and attacks inside Russia.

Ukraine's continued targeting of senior Russian military figures has underscored failures within Russia's security services.

Last December, Kyiv sources claimed responsibility for the assassination of Lt Gen Igor Kirillov, the head of the military's nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces, who was killed by a bomb concealed in an electric scooter outside his apartment building, a day after Ukraine levelled criminal charges against him. His assistant, Ilya Polikarpov, was also killed in the attack.

Vladimir Putin described the killing of Kirillov as a “major blunder” by the country's security agencies, saying they should learn from it and improve their effectiveness.

It is unclear whether the high-profile killing of Sarvarov today will have any impact on the peace talks, as Ukrainian and US officials are holding discussions in Florida aimed at ending the nearly four-year war between Russia and Ukraine.

The Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said that Russia is ready to confirm in a legal agreement that it has no intention of attacking either the EU or Nato, according to a report in the state RIA news agency. We have not been able to independently verify these comments yet.

As mentioned in a previous post, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has offered to drop Ukraine's ambition to join Nato in an attempt to show his willingness to reach an agreement to bring about an end to the war.

In return, Zelenskyy and his European allies have been pushing for “article-5-like” security guarantees from Europe and the US, referring to Nato's founding principle that an attack on one member country should be considered as an attack on all.

Last week, American officials reportedly said the US was ready to offer Ukraine Nato-like security guarantees to safeguard an eventual ceasefire in Russia's war on Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said last week that without a significant cash injection by spring, Ukraine will have to cut its drone production, with Kyiv under pressure to cede territory as the US pushes for a swift deal to bring the war to an end.

As a reminder, EU leaders agreed on Friday to provide €90bn ($106bn) to Ukraine to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years, although they failed to bridge differences with Belgium that would have allowed them to use frozen Russian assets to raise the funds. Instead, they were borrowed from capital markets.

Most of Russia's €210bn worth of assets in the EU are held by Euroclear, the Brussels-based securities depository.

Belgium is deeply anxious about being left exposed to legal and financial risks, and other states including Italy have also voiced concerns. Russia has filed a lawsuit against Euroclear in a Moscow court to try to get its money back.

Ukraine needs about €137bn over the next two years to cover its military/public services.

The EU Council said in a press release on Monday that it has extended economic sanctions against Russia for six more months, in response to Moscow's ongoing aggression against Ukraine.

The measures will remain in force until 31 July 2026, the council said. The press release reads:

These economic measures, first introduced in 2014, were significantly expanded since February 2022 in response to Russia's unprovoked, unjustified and illegal military aggression against Ukraine.

They currently consist of a broad spectrum of sectoral measures, including restrictions on trade, finance, energy, technology and dual-use goods, industry, transport and luxury goods. 

They also cover: a ban on the import or transfer of seaborne crude oil and certain petroleum products from Russia to the EU, a de-SWIFTing of several Russian banks and the suspension of the broadcasting activities and licenses in the European Union of several Kremlin-backed disinformation outlets. Additionally, specific measures enable the EU to counter sanctions circumvention.

As long as the illegal actions by the Russian Federation continue to violate fundamental rules of international law, including, in particular, the prohibition on the use of force, it is appropriate to maintain in force all the measures imposed by the EU and to take additional measures, if necessary.

The Ukrainian army is battling an attempted Russian breakthrough in the Sumy region, it has said, after reports Moscow forcibly moved 50 people from a border village there.

That marks a renewed Russian advance in the part of the region largely spared from intense ground fighting since Ukraine regained land there in a 2022 counteroffensive.

“Fighting is currently ongoing in the village of Grabovske,” Ukraine's joint taskforce said yesterday, adding the troops were “making efforts to drive the occupiers back into Russian territory”.

It also refuted media reports saying Moscow's troops were in the neighbouring Ryasne village. Earlier on Sunday, the Ukrainian rights ombudsman said Russian troops forcibly moved about 50 people from Grabovske to Russia. There was no official comment from Russia.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Bus crash kills 16

A passenger bus crash killed at least 16 people on the main island of Java just after midnight yesterday, officials said. The bus carrying 34 people lost control on a toll road traveling from Jakarta to Yogyakarta and struck a concrete barrier before rolling onto its side, said Budiono, a search and rescue agency head who goes by a single name. “The forceful impact threw several passengers and left them trapped against the bus body,” Budiono said. Police and rescue teams arrived about 40 minutes after the crash and recovered the bodies of six passengers who died at the scene. Ten more people died on the way to hospital or while being treated, Budiono said.

MALAYSIA

Ex-PM denied house arrest

The Kuala Lumpur High Court yesterday denied a bid by jailed former prime minister Najib Razak to serve the remainder of his sentence at home, in the first of two key rulings the former leader faces this week over his role in the multibillion-dollar 1MDB scandal. Najib, who has been imprisoned since 2022, had his 12-year jail sentence halved last year by a pardons board chaired by the country's former king. However, he insisted that the monarch also issued an “addendum order” that converts his sentence to house arrest. The court said the existence of the document was not in dispute, but the order was not legally enforceable as it was not made with the consultation of the country's pardons board, as required under the constitution.

Pulled Trump photo restored

A photo of President Donald Trump that had been removed from the cache of Jeffrey Epstein files released by the Department of Justice was restored on Sunday after officials determined none of Epstein's victims were in the image, the department said. The photo showing a desk with an open drawer containing a photo of Trump with various women was flagged by the Southern District of New York for review to protect potential victims. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said earlier on Sunday that his office removed the photo because of concerns about women in the image. “It has nothing to do with President Trump,” Blanche said during a Sunday morning appearance on NBC's Meet the Press with Kristen Welker.

Signs bring confusion, joy

Outside an abandoned building in Christchurch, a sign reads “slightly haunted but manageable.” In the middle of a busy shopping strip, pedestrians are warned to keep to a 2.83kph walking speed. In another part of Christchurch, one piece of signage declares simply “don't.” The baffling boards are not an overzealous new council initiative, but a piece of art designed to “play with the way we take authority and signage so seriously.” Despite resembling official Christchurch City Council signs, the “Christchurch city confusion” warnings are the work of artist Cameron Hunt. “The idea was to make signs that look official, but with completely absurd messages, therefore creating moments of confusion, followed by little bursts of joy,” Hunt said. Hunt erected six signs around the city center, as part of the Little Street art festival early this month. “Watching people interact with the signs has been awesome,” Hunt said. “There have also been a few grumpy people who've joked about writing to the council about these ‘ridiculous signs.'”

The US Coast Guard is pursuing an oil tanker in international waters near Venezuela, officials said on Sunday, in what would be the second such operation at the weekend and the third in less than two weeks if successful.

“The United States Coast Guard is in active pursuit of a sanctioned ‘dark fleet' vessel that is part of Venezuela's illegal sanctions evasion,” a US official said. “It is flying a false flag and under a judicial seizure order.”

Another official said the tanker was under sanctions, but added that it had not been boarded so far and that interceptions can take different forms — including by sailing or flying close to vessels of concern.

The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, did not give a specific location for the operation or name the vessel being pursued.

British maritime risk management group Vanguard, along with a US maritime security source, identified the vessel as Bella 1, a large crude oil carrier that was added last year to the sanctions list of the US Department of the Treasury, which said the vessel has links to Iran.

Bella 1 was empty when it was approaching Venezuela on Sunday, according to TankerTrackers.com.

The vessel had in 2021 provided transportation for Venezuela's oil to China, internal documents from state-run oil company PDVSA showed.

It had also previously carried Iranian crude, according to the vessel monitoring service.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday.

US President Donald Trump last week announced a “blockade” of all oil tankers under sanctions entering and leaving Venezuela.

Trump's pressure campaign on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has included a ramped-up military presence in the region and more than two dozen military strikes on vessels in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea near the South American nation. At least 100 people have been killed in the attacks.

Nine people have been killed and 10 injured by gunmen at a township tavern near Johannesburg in the latest in a series of mass shootings that the South African police seem powerless to halt. 

About 12 gunmen arrived in two vehicles and opened fire in the tavern shortly after midnight on Saturday night, and then continued to shoot randomly as they fled the scene, killing a taxi driver who was dropping off a customer nearby, police said.

The shooting took place in Bekkersdal, about 40 kilometres west of Johannesburg, where an increase in illegal gold mining in abandoned mine shafts has triggered a wave of gang warfare as criminals fight for the profits.

At least one of the gunmen was firing a Kalashnikov assault rifle, while others wielded 9-millimetre pistols, and some wore balaclava masks, police said. They have not made any arrests and are still investigating the motive for the shooting.

The local municipality, Rand West City, issued a statement on Sunday appealing to the national government to deploy the military in the area to help the police combat a “disturbing surge” in violent crime by illegal miners.

But similar shootings with multiple victims have taken place at taverns across the country for years, including seven mass shootings this year alone. They often happen in townships, which were built outside cities in the apartheid era as segregated housing areas for workers.

Just two weeks ago, gunmen killed 12 people – including a three-year-old child – after opening fire in an unlicensed tavern at a hostel for migrant workers in a township near Pretoria.

“These horrific events serve as a stark and undeniable indicator of the escalating levels of lawlessness that are currently plaguing our country,” said Yusuf Abramjee, a prominent South African anti-crime activist, in a social-media post on Sunday.

“The frequency and audacity with which these acts of violence are being perpetrated suggest a systemic breakdown in law enforcement and a concerning erosion of respect for human life and societal order,” he said.

South Africa's murder rate, averaging more than 60 killings per day, is among the highest in the world. Police have been unable to reverse the trend, and there is mounting evidence – including from testimony at an official public inquiry this year – that the police are often collaborating with criminals.

Sandile Mahlangu, a resident of Bekkersdal and a former member of its community policing forum, said the police sometimes collect bribes from gang members who terrorize the community.

“The problem is that the police are in cahoots with criminals, and these criminals do as they please and they carry guns as they please,” Mr. Mahlangu told the South African state broadcaster, SABC, on Sunday after the shooting.

“People are afraid to give information to the police because they know they are not safe. If they give information, the police tell the criminals, who will go and get that person. The communities are living in terror because these gangs are fighting each other.”

The public inquiry, which began its hearings in September, has heard extensive evidence of senior police officers accepting bribes and providing information to help criminals.

The government appointed the inquiry after a provincial police commander, Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi, called a press conference in July to allege that top officials and politicians were interfering in police operations to protect corrupt associates and criminal syndicates.

Testimony at the inquiry has implicated police in a wide range of corrupt activities and criminal rackets, including murder, robberies, hijacking trucks and feeding information to criminals in exchange for payments.

One witness, former police officer Marius van der Merwe, described how police had tortured and murdered a robbery suspect and then covered up the crime by cleaning the site and dumping the body at a dam.

Barely three weeks after his November testimony, Mr. van der Merwe was shot and killed in front of his family as he returned to his home on the evening of Dec. 5. Nobody has been arrested for the killing.

CBS News' 60 Minutes on Sunday didn't air a planned story on Trump administration deportations of immigrants to El Salvador, pulling it only hours before airtime at the direction of new editor-in-chief Bari Weiss.

The story, where correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi spoke to deportees who had been sent to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison, was held because Weiss sought to add perspective from the Trump administration, according to people at the network.

In an e-mail sent to some colleagues and reported by multiple media outlets, Alfonsi said she'd learned on Saturday that Weiss had decided not to air it. She said her story was factually correct and cleared by CBS attorneys and news standards officials. “In my view, pulling it now – after every rigorous internal check has been met is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.”

Paramount settles with Trump over ‘60 Minutes' interview for US$16-million

The shift, publicly announced two hours before the broadcast aired, is sure to increase scrutiny on Weiss, the founder of the Free Press website who was installed at the top of CBS News this fall when its parent company, Paramount, was bought out.

President Donald Trump has been sharply critical of 60 Minutes. He sued the network last fall over its interview with election opponent Kamala Harris, which was settled this summer, and recently complained about the show's interview with former ally turned foe Marjorie Taylor Greene.

Weiss told The New York Times in a statement: “My job is to make sure that all the stories we publish are the best they can be. Holding stories that aren't ready for whatever reason – that they lack sufficient context, say, or that they are missing critical voices – happens every day in every newsroom.”

She said she looked forward to airing Alfonsi's piece “when it's ready.”

US President Donald Trump's newly named envoy has said he hopes to help ""make Greenland part of the US."" Denmark, which controls the autonomous island, is ""deeply angered"" according to its foreign minister.

Denmark is incensed at the appointment of Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry as new US special envoy to Greenland as President Donald Trump continues to heap pressure on the Nordic nation and looks to take over the autonomous territory from Copenhagen.

In appointing Landry on Sunday, Trump — who has threatened to take Greenland by force from ally Denmark if necessary — wrote that the southern governor, ""understands how essential Greenland is to our National Security, and will strongly advance our Country's Interests for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Allies, and indeed, the World.""

Landry took to the social media platform X to thank Trump for the appointment, writing, ""It's an honor to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the US.""

On Monday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said the move left him ""deeply angered"" and said Washington must respect Denmark's sovereignty, with Copenhagen vowing to summon the US ambassador in protest.

""As long as we have a kingdom in Denmark that consists of Denmark, the Faroe Islands, and Greenland,"" said Rasmussen, ""we cannot accept that there are those who undermine our sovereignty.""

Rasmussen told Denmark's TV 2 that he was ""particularly upset by his [Landry's] statements,"" calling them ""completely unacceptable,"" and adding to the Reuters news agency: ""We insist that everyone — including the US — must show respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark.""

The EU said it stands in ""full solidarity"" with Denmark and the people of Greenland as the US increased its efforts to take over the island. 
 
European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa both voiced their solidarity with Copenhagen, one of the EU's members, by calling territorial integrity and sovereignty ""fundamental principles of international law.""
 
""These principles are essential not only for the European Union, but for nations around the world,"" both posted on their X accounts.

Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said news of the appointment, ""might sound like a big deal,"" but added that it ""doesn't change anything for us here at home.""

""We will determine our future ourselves,"" he said.

In a joint statement with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, Nielsen added: “Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders and the US shall not take over Greenland.” 

Though most Greenlanders say they want to be independent of Denmark, they have also voiced very clear opposition to becoming the property of the US.

Trump, who floated the option of buying Greenland and established a new consulate there during his first term, has repeatedly threatened to get it no matter what since returning to office in January 2025.

He has sought to emphasize Greenland's location and mineral riches as key to US national security and has ignored the wishes of Greenlanders and Danish leaders in his pursuit.

The US has also dispatched high-level representatives such as Vice President JD Vance as well as Donald Trump Jr., to Greenland in an apparent effort to push the president's agenda.

This August, Denmark — a NATO ally — summoned US representatives over reports suggesting Washington was attempting to interfere in Greenland.

Greenland, located halfway between the US and the Arctic, is a former Danish colony that has held the right to declare its independence since 2009.

US Democrats have accused the local Department of Justice of removing at least 16 documents from the first batch of Epstein files, including a photograph showing Donald Trump, less than 24 hours after their release. Viewer discretion is advised. 

The controversy surrounding the so-called Epstein files has only grown since the US Justice Department released the first batch on Friday.

The data dump sparked fierce criticism from both Democrats and Republicans due to the extensive redactions in many of the documents.

Less than 24 hours after publication, it was reported that at least 16 files had been removed from the DOJ's website, including one showing a photograph of Donald Trump.

The Justice Department is now facing allegations that it is shielding the US president and analysts warn that the limited disclosure could cost Trump votes in the US midterm elections.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

Drone sightings this year have disrupted German airports, causing headaches for travelers. Germany has ordered special anti-aircraft tanks to combat the unmanned aerial vehicles. 

Germany has registered over 1,000 suspicious drone flights so far in 2025, the head of Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) told German newspaper Bild in comments published on Sunday.   

BKA chief Holger Münch said the drone sightings represent a ""significant situation of danger."" 

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said in October that the German government believes Russia is behind many of the drone sightings over German territory.

Münch told Bild that it cannot be assumed with ""100% certainty"" that all of the suspicious drones are being guided by Russia. However, he said he suspects the drones are being steered by a state actor aimed at sowing uncertainty in Germany.      

Drone sightings this year have disrupted German airports, canceling flights and causing headaches for travelers.

Munich Airport, for example, halted air traffic control operations on October 3 as the city held its world-famous Oktoberfest event. In November, Berlin Brandenburg Airport also had to suspend operations for nearly two hours due to unidentified drone sightings.  

Drones are also sometimes sighted over German military installations.

German news outlet Der Spiegel reported that four drones were spotted on October 13 at a German military base in the northeastern town of Gnoien, near the major city of Rostock. The report said that Ukrainian soldiers were being trained at the Gnoien base at the time of the incident.

German authorities are now seeking to combat the unmanned aerial vehicles in a more effective and rapid fashion. 

German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt on Wednesday opened the joint counter-drone center (GDAZ) in Berlin, which will coordinate federal and state capabilities when it comes to drone defense. 

""The joint counter-drone center operates around the clock and is designated to respond quickly and in a coordinated manner to security threats,"" a German government statement said. ""It combines the technical expertise of the federal and state governments, creating a robust framework for ongoing communication, joint situation assessments and coordinated action in drone defense.""  

Dobrindt has also commissioned a drone defense unit to assist airports and other sites when drone incidents occur.

Germany's Armed Forces, the Bundeswehr, has also ordered special anti-aircraft tanks that are effective in fighting swarms of drones.

Todd Blanche's actions violated the federal conflicts of interest law and his ethics agreement, experts said.

This story was originally published by
 ProPublica.


Before Todd Blanche could be confirmed as the second-highest official at the Justice Department, he had to satisfy the concerns of ethics officials.

Blanche, President Donald Trump's personal attorney during his New York criminal trial last year, was a cryptocurrency investor with holdings of between $159,000 and $485,000, records show.

To prevent possible violations of the federal conflicts of interest statute, Blanche promised to dump his digital assets no later than 90 days after his Senate confirmation in March, according to his government ethics agreement. He also pledged not to participate in any matter that could have a “direct and predictable effect on my financial interests in the virtual currency” until his Bitcoin and other crypto-related products were sold.

But about a month into the job — before divesting — Blanche issued a memo that ordered an end to investigations into crypto companies, dealers and exchanges launched during President Joe Biden's term. He also eliminated an enforcement team dedicated to looking for crypto-related fraud and money-laundering schemes. And his memo said the Justice Department would assist Trump's crypto working group of experts and Cabinet members that went on to issue a list of recommendations aimed at making the United States the global leader in digital coins.

Blanche's directives, while he still owned significant crypto investments, violated the conflicts of interest law and his ethics agreement, legal experts and former federal ethics officials told ProPublica.

“If you are invested in that industry and now making a decision that could affect whether or not the DOJ is gonna pursue prosecutions, that's an obvious conflict of interest,” said Virginia Canter, who served as an ethics lawyer at the White House, Treasury Department and Securities and Exchange Commission during the presidencies of George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama.

Even when he did ultimately divest his crypto interests, Blanche's ethics records show he did so by transferring them to his adult children and a grandchild, a move the experts said is technically legal but at odds with the spirit and intent of the law.

Blanche's actions illustrate the ethical problems posed as the Trump administration relaxes regulation of digital money to make good on the president's vow to make the U.S. “the crypto capital of the world.” In less than a year, Trump has nominated at least 216 political appointees who owned — either by themselves or with their spouses — cryptocurrency investments worth between $175 million and $340 million at the time of their nomination, a ProPublica review of federal financial disclosure records found. By contrast, in the first two years of his presidency, Biden appointed about two dozen people who, combined, held less than $7 million in crypto investments.

Trump's crypto-friendly appointees include several who head agencies with regulatory authority over the industry.

Among them is Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Until this year, Lutnick was CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, a financial services firm with billions in crypto investments. The firm is also the primary banker for Tether, among the world's largest issuers of stablecoins — a type of crypto pegged to the dollar or another asset to avoid wild swings in value. 

After signing an ethics agreement, Lutnick transferred his stake in Cantor Fitzgerald to his children, including his two adult sons who now run the firm. The transfer was completed in October. By then, Lutnick had taken several pro-crypto steps — announcing that Trump would create a bitcoin strategic reserve, having his department take part in the president's crypto working group and publishing economic data on nine key blockchains, a move designed to foster more trust in the digital market. (The blockchain is a digital ledger that underlies cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.)

A Commerce Department spokesperson noted that Lutnick was given a limited waiver from the White House allowing him to work on general issues that could affect Cantor Fitzgerald while the transfer of his stake in the firm was pending. The waiver was dated July 8, nearly five months after he was sworn in. The spokesperson said Lutnick “fully complied with the terms of his ethics agreement” and did not have any “economic gains or losses associated” with the transfer of his stake in the firm. 

Another crypto-friendly appointee is Paul Atkins, chair of the SEC, whose ethics records show he owned stakes of up to $6 million in crypto-related businesses before his confirmation in April. Since Trump took office, Atkins' agency has dropped or settled enforcement cases with crypto companies.

Atkins signed an ethics agreement promising to sell a crypto investment fund and equity in two crypto companies. He has since filed paperwork saying he complied with the agreement and listed millions of dollars worth of investments he sold, but those do not mention any crypto-related sales. An SEC spokesman said Atkins complied with his ethics obligations but would not say when he sold his crypto-related assets. 

A staffer for Blanche said he and the Justice Department would not comment.

Trump has led the way on ethical conflicts connected to crypto. During last year's election campaign, he pledged to the crypto industry he would end Biden's strict approach toward regulation. In turn, the industry heavily bet on Trump, spending millions to support his election and those of other Republican candidates.

On the eve of the election, Trump promised he would be America's “crypto president” if he won a second term. He and his sons launched their own cryptocurrency business, World Liberty Financial, and after his election victory, Trump and his wife, Melania, issued a pair of meme coins, allowing anyone to use crypto to enrich the incoming president. Within days of taking office in January, Trump signed a presidential action promoting the growth of digital assets and started nominating government officials to fulfill his goal.

James Thurber, a former congressional staffer who worked on federal ethics reforms and is now professor emeritus at American University, characterized the Trump administration's disregard of traditional government ethics as unprecedented. He contrasted Trump's sale of crypto coins to the example set by President Jimmy Carter, who announced he was putting his peanut farm into a blind trust when he took office.

Thurber noted that Obama and Biden required their appointees to comply with an ethics pledge to avoid conflicts of interest. On the day of his inauguration in January, Trump rescinded Biden's ethics pledge requirements for appointees.

“The conflicts of interest in this administration are blatant and hugely against the public interest.” Thurber said.

Trump's press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said in a statement to ProPublica that the “administration is fulfilling the President's promise to make the United States the crypto capital of the world by driving innovation and economic opportunity for all Americans.”

“Neither the President nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest,” she added.

Tonya Evans, a former professor at Penn State Dickinson Law who now consults on the digital economy, said the increase in crypto investors serving in the executive branch under Trump is a measure of the industry's success in taking over regulatory bodies that were previously hostile to them. She compared the industry's newfound power to how Goldman Sachs alums — such as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin during Trump's first term or Biden's SEC chair, Gary Gensler — held prominent government positions and were able to exert outsized influence on shaping financial policy.

“My concern is not so much that people who understand crypto are in leadership positions,” she wrote in an email to ProPublica, “but that ethics frameworks may not yet meet this critical fork in the road of development, especially if ‘divestiture' takes the form of passing to family. We are a long way from President Carter's peanut farm!”

Blanche rose to prominence in recent years as Trump's main defender in criminal court.

A former federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York, Blanche, 51, was his lead attorney in the Manhattan trial that resulted in Trump being convicted of 34 felonies stemming from his hush-money payment to a pornographic actress, Stormy Daniels. Blanche also defended Trump against criminal charges accusing him of conspiring to subvert the 2020 election and retaining highly classified documents. (Those two cases were dropped after Trump was elected president.)

Since gaining Senate confirmation on March 5, Blanche has helped lead a massive remaking of the Department of Justice, shifting the emphasis from long-standing priorities, like the protection of civil rights. Thousands of employees have been terminated or resigned as the new administration ended police misconduct prosecutions, environmental abuse lawsuits and abortion access cases. Blanche has pushed for tougher border control enforcement and the use of fraud statutes to prosecute institutions with diversity-and-inclusion-related policies. As news of Trump's ties to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein gained momentum this year, it was Blanche who personally interviewed Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's longtime confidante now serving a 20-year prison sentence for helping him sexually abuse underage girls.

When Blanche issued the sweeping memo ending the department's Biden-era crypto enforcement approach, he effectively ended a three-year effort aimed at penetrating the shadowy world of transnational criminals.

The agency's National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team, as it was called, had won the conviction of a man who defrauded crypto investors out of $110 million; a guilty plea from a Russian man who processed more than $700 million through an online market place for drug trafficking, money laundering and other crimes; and the conviction of a cryptocurrency exchange operator that helped launder billions from hackers, ransomware attacks, identity theft schemes and narcotics distribution rings.

The team also assisted a multiagency probe of Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. The investigation found, among other things, that Binance failed to report and prevent suspicious financial transactions for Hamas, al-Qaida and other terrorist organizations. Federal prosecutors charged the company's founder, Changpeng Zhao, with violating U.S. anti-money-laundering laws, and to settle the case, Zhao pleaded guilty, resigned as company chief executive and served a four-month prison sentence. He also agreed to pay the U.S. $4.3 billion in penalties. (Trump pardoned Zhao in October. Months earlier, Binance had used a stablecoin developed by the Trump-owned World Liberty Financial to fund a $2 billion deal.)  

In his April 7 memo titled “Ending Regulation by Prosecution,” Blanche scoffed at the Biden Justice Department's approach toward crypto, calling it “a reckless strategy of regulation by prosecution, which was ill conceived and poorly executed.” He said the agency would now target only the terrorists and drug traffickers who illicitly used crypto, not the platforms that hosted them. He announced the disbanding of the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team.

“The digital assets industry is critical to the Nation's economic development and innovation,” Blanche wrote. “President Trump has also made clear that ‘[w]e are going to end the regulatory weaponization against digital assets.'”

The market reacted favorably; crypto trading spiked.

At the time, Blanche hadn't relinquished his Bitcoin worth between $100,000 and $250,000, nor his investments in the cryptocurrencies Solana and Ethereum or his stock holdings in Coinbase. Blanche should have recused himself from the decision, experts told ProPublica.

Under the federal conflicts of interest statute, government officials are forbidden from taking part in a “particular matter” that can financially benefit them or their immediate family, unless they have a special waiver from the government. The penalties range from up to one year in jail or a civil fine of up to $50,000 all the way to as much as five years in prison if someone willfully violates the law.

Blanche's wide-ranging memo benefited the industry broadly, including his own investments, ethics experts said.

In an ethics filing he electronically signed in June, Blanche said his Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency investments — including Solana, Cardano and Ethereum —  “were gifted in their entirety to my grandchild and adult children.” Financial disclosure records don't provide exact amounts but instead a broad range for the worth of a government official's investment. At that point, Blanche's records show his transfers to his family members were worth between $116,000 and $315,000. He said he sold additional crypto-related investments worth between $5,000 and $75,000. The divestment took place in late May and early June, the ethics filing said.

Legal experts noted that the federal conflict-of-interest law prohibits government officials from using their position in a way that would financially benefit a spouse or a minor child; it does not mention adult children or grandchildren.

Still, even if legal, giving assets like these to a relative doesn't satisfy the ethical concern that a government official could act in a way that helps their family financially, they said.

“The purpose of the law is to eliminate even the appearance that an official's decisions are influenced by their financial interests,” said Kedric Payne, a former deputy chief counsel for the Office of Congressional Ethics who is senior ethics director at the Campaign Legal Center. “That purpose is defeated when an official simply gives conflicted assets to adult children.”

Over a dozen files on alleged child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein that were released by the Department of Justice last week have been removed from the department's website.

In addition to removing the files, critics have alleged that the DOJ has not released the entirety of Epstein investigation materials that should have been made public. Authors of the bill that compelled the administration to release the files have suggested financial punishments against Trump administration officials if they fail to comply soon.

CBS News reports that at least 15 files that were included in the DOJ's database of Epstein files are no longer available to view. The department has stated that some materials were taken down to protect the identities of Epstein's victims, but it's unclear why those specific files were removed.

“Photos and other materials will continue being reviewed and redacted consistent with the law in an abundance of caution as we receive additional information,” the DOJ said on social media.

One file has been restored — a photograph of framed pictures in an office, one of which included President Donald Trump, leading to speculation that the files were removed in order to protect him. The DOJ initially claimed the picture was taken down “out of an abundance of caution” to review whether potential victims were in the image. 

“After the review, it was determined there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph, and it has been reposted without any alteration or redaction,” the DOJ said in a statement. 

But the DOJ has heavily redacted hundreds of pages of material, possibly in violation of the legislation that prompted the release of the files in the first place. In the initial Epstein files release, at least 550 pages were entirely redacted.

The law forcing the release of the Epstein files requires, except in certain circumstances, the complete release of all files relating to numerous investigations into Epstein, including information about the many prominent figures who were connected to him. Victims' names can be redacted or their faces covered, but for the most part, the information has to be made available to the public.

There are noticeable gaps in the files that have been released so far — information that is public knowledge, for example, hasn't been made public, fueling speculation that more documents that aren't publicly known are still being withheld. 

“What else is being covered up? We need transparency for the American public,” the X account for Democrats on the House Oversight Committee said.

While the DOJ has suggested that information is being redacted to protect Epstein's victims, many of them have expressed frustration with the government's lack of transparency.

When the files came out, “we were just in shock, and we see that there is nothing there that is transparent,” said Epstein survivor Marina Lacerda. “It's very sad, it's very disappointing.”

“They are proving everything we have been saying about corruption and delayed justice. What are they protecting? The cover-up continues,” said another survivor, Jess Michaels. 

The bipartisan authors of the law that required the files' release have suggested legal ramifications for the DOJ's failure to comply.

“The document dump on Friday “does not comply with…[the] Epstein Transparency Act,” Rep. Ro Khanna (D-California) said on X over the weekend, adding that “it is an incomplete release, with too many redactions.”

Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Kentucky), who co-authored the law with Khanna, agreed.

The DOJ's file dump so far “grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law that @realDonaldTrump signed just 30 days ago. @RepRoKhannais is correct,” Massie wrote on X. 

In an appearance on CBS News's “Face the Nation” program on Sunday, Massie suggested that Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is responsible for making the files public, could face punishment from Congress for the DOJ's failures.

“The quickest way, and I think most expeditious way, to get justice for these victims is to bring inherent contempt against Pam Bondi,” Massie said, indicating that he and Khanna were drafting such a resolution already. 

If successful, after a 30-day grace period, Bondi could face daily fines if the DOJ still hasn't released all of the files. 

Despite noticeable gaps in the files that were made public, there are numerous materials that suggest prominent figures may have had knowledge of Epstein's wrongdoings.

Multiple photos show former President Bill Clinton interacting with younger women, including an image of him in a hot tub with an individual whose face is redacted. Movie director Brett Ratner (who most recently directed Melania Trump's newly released documentary) is also seen in photos that were part of the document dump. And the files detail an eyebrow-raising interaction between Epstein and Trump, in which the former introduced the latter to a 14-year-old girl, and “playfully” asked Trump, “This is a good one, right?” according to the document in question. Trump reportedly smiled at Epstein and said he agreed with his assessment.

Trump reluctantly signed the Epstein bill into law in November, after months of opposing the legislation and repeatedly calling it a “hoax” against him. His stance on the matter shifted only after it became clear that the bill would pass the House through the use of a bipartisan discharge petition. 

Polling among the American public shows many are troubled by the president's lack of transparency on the matter, especially given that he promised during the 2024 campaign to release the files, only to renege on that pledge after taking office. According to an Economist/YouGov poll last month, nearly half of all Americans (49 percent, and a plurality in the poll) believe Trump was trying to cover up Epstein's crimes.

December is the most critical time of year for Truthout, because our nonprofit news is funded almost entirely by individual donations from readers like you. So before you navigate away, we ask that you take just a second to support Truthout with a tax-deductible donation.

 Ending the Cycle of Hostility and Threats

 M. Javad Zarif and Amir Parsa Garmsiri

In contemporary international relations, security is not just something countries seek for themselves. It is also a concept they use to justify controlling, constraining, and directing others' behavior. When political scientists speak of “securitization,” they refer to a process through which a particular issue is portrayed as an existential threat justifying extraordinary measures instead of something that governments can address through normal politics.

The Islamic Republic of Iran serves as a perfect illustration. Over the last two decades, Israel and the United States have tried to persuade the world to stop treating Iran as a normal country and to instead treat it like the international system's leading danger. The result has been constant denunciations, crushing sanctions, threats of military action, and, most recently, military operations against its territory—carried out during diplomatic negotiations between Tehran and Washington. Iran, in response, has been forced to devote more resources and attention to defense. It also increased uranium enrichment in defiance, to show that it would not be pressured into submission. The external securitization of Iran has fed into a parallel dynamic at home, as the state adopted a stricter approach in dealing with domestic social challenges, responding to these challenges with tighter restrictions.

The result is a securitization cycle: a vicious spiral in which Iran and its adversaries feel compelled to adopt more hostile policies in response to each other's behavior. This phenomenon is somewhat like the security dilemma, in which one government's decision to bolster its capabilities prompts others to do the same. But with the security dilemma, each side is reacting to material increases in the other's capacity. This cycle begins with rhetoric. The target country is portrayed as a threat, and then is treated as a threat. And in response, it turns to activities—such as bolstering its missile capabilities or increasing enrichment—that can be used to corroborate the initial allegation. The cycle, in other words, produces a self-fulfilling prophecy. The securitized country gradually distances itself from independent agency and becomes trapped in a series of reactive behaviors.

Breaking this cycle will not be easy, and it will require that foreign powers respect Iran's rights and dignity and stop constantly defaming, threatening, and coercing a millennia-old civilization-state. But there are steps that Tehran can take to help in breaking the vicious securitization cycle. It can start by shoring up domestic support through economic reforms, bolstering its hand in international negotiations. After all, Iranian people have proved to be Iran's greatest asset in resisting and deterring foreign aggression. Tehran can also recalibrate its emphasis on material defensive power—an emphasis that often amplifies threat perceptions—and instead prioritize cooperation and coordination, particularly at the regional level. It can establish a frank dialogue with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to address mutual concerns and find a way to resume cooperation. And it can engage with the United States to manage their differences, starting with the nuclear issue and sanctions.

Over the past two decades, Iran has been the target of intense securitization by Israel and the United States. Together, the two have constructed and disseminated a narrative that portrays Iran as an existential threat not just to its region but also to the entire globe. Benjamin Netanyahu, who called Iranian government “a messianic apocalyptic cult,” alleged in a speech before the Knesset in 1992 that “Iran is three to five years from being able to produce a nuclear weapon.” U.S. President Donald Trump, among his many insults, has called Iran “a very evil place.” The manifest absurdity of these claims hasn't stopped either of the two from continuing to advance them and engage in increasingly belligerent behavior. The United States has implemented extraordinary economic sanctions against Iran. Israel, aided by Washington, has bombed Iran's infrastructure and killed its military leaders, scientists, and ordinary civilians.

As a result, Iran has been forced to react with defiant policies instead of pursuing its initial goal-oriented plans. In response to growing U.S. and Israeli pressure, it increased its uranium enrichment level to 60 percent and reduced its cooperation with the IAEA. Following the unprovoked joint U.S.-Israeli attacks, ordinary Iranians began debating whether Iran's defense doctrine should change to include nuclear weapons. Calls for blocking the Strait of Hormuz have gained momentum. Had it not been for such aggression, Iran would have continued its unprecedented cooperation with the IAEA under the 2015 nuclear deal. It would have focused on regional cooperation, which it has championed since 1985.

Iran's securitization has created a siege mentality, which often leads to the imposition of tighter social controls. These include restrictions on the Internet and social media and surveillance measures intended to root out spies and saboteurs. Such measures are certainly ineffective at addressing the sources of domestic discontent: economic hardship, the erosion of social capital, and a widening gap between the state and society. But they are what happens when a siege mentality is imposed on a country for decades. In Tehran's case, the securitization began with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein—who waged war on Iran for eight years—and with separatist violence and massive terrorist operations shortly after the country's 1979 revolution. It has continued thanks to constant U.S. and Israeli threats and coercion. Under these circumstances, any government would become consumed with real and perceived existential external threats to its dignity and independence.

And external threats are part of why Iran faces such hardship in the first place. Tehran, after all, has been forced to spend more on its military and less on development and welfare because Iraq, Israel, and the United States have attacked it. In addition, the economic warfare Washington has waged against Iran—via U.S. President Barack Obama's crippling sanctions and then Trump's maximum pressure campaign—has led to huge loss in the rial's value, unbearable inflation, and rampant corruption to circumvent sanctions. Yet rather than see their own role in immiserating Iranians, outside powers have made politically charged, exaggerated, and selective portrayals of the Islamic Republic as a violator of human rights. This, in turn, has intensified the cycle of securitization and further reduced Iran's capacity for independent agency in the global arena.

To build both a better Iran and a safer world, Tehran and its antagonists will need to find a way out of this spiral. What will not work is apparent. Pressure has not persuaded Iran to change its behavior. Similarly, Iran's defensive policies, such as increased nuclear enrichment, have never diminished perceived threats. Securitization operates in the realm of mental perceptions rather than material capability. As a result, defensive measures by the target often end up playing into the hands of hostile powers by strengthening their narratives. This is particularly true regarding provocative rhetoric, such as absurd statements in the 2010s by irresponsible Iranian politicians that Iran controlled four Arab capitals—Damascus, Baghdad, Beirut, and Sanaa—which were used by securitizing forces to justify their pressure against Iran.

That might make it seem as if Tehran is inextricably trapped. But history shows that, through careful diplomacy, it can find a way out. Iran was able to break the securitization cycle during the first half of the 2010s by engaging in dialogue with the United States, culminating in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which sought to ensure that, in return for economic normalization, Iran would never develop a nuclear weapon. The agreement changed Iran's international environment (if only temporarily). The UN Security Council confirmed this reality in Resolution 2231, which declared “that the conclusion of the JCPOA marks a fundamental shift in its consideration of this issue” and expressed the entire body's “desire to build a new relationship with Iran strengthened by the implementation of the JCPOA.”

Iran's success in securing this agreement was primarily the result of high turnout in the 2013 presidential election, which dispelled illusions in the United States and Europe about the imminent collapse of the Islamic Republic—illusions that dated to Iran's post-2009 election unrest. The 2013 election also provided domestic legitimacy to the incoming Rouhani administration, which sought to preserve and protect the rights of Iranian people through dialogue rather than defiance. Breaking the securitization cycle, in other words, began at home, by building a broad domestic consensus. Iran can create such a consensus again, but doing so will require establishing a national dialogue among political groups, social factions, and the general population. Thankfully, Iran already has online platforms, created by nongovernmental organizations, that citizens can use to register complaints about policies and bureaucrats. These platforms also keep track of how widespread such complaints are. The government should encourage this reporting, and it should require that state agencies take corrective measures in response to such complaints. This would increase the government's social capital and thus lay the groundwork for implementing policies aimed at countering securitization.

The Iranian government can further reinforce public confidence by improving Iranians' living conditions. Although the United States' economic war on Iran precludes massive economic improvements in the immediate future, the government can still combat corruption, enhance transparency, and curb the rent-seeking behavior that arises from sanctions circumvention. Doing so would reduce social and economic disparities, increase public satisfaction, and thus lessen the need for internal, securitized policies.

As it builds consensus at home, Tehran can begin working to improve its international reputation. Officials should prioritize confidence-building measures centered on improving dialogue with Iran's neighbors. They might, for example, pursue former Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's proposed Hormuz Peace Endeavor, which aimed at fostering cooperation and confidence building among countries neighboring the strategic Strait of Hormuz. They could also create a Muslim West Asian Dialogue Association, which aims to replace enmity with amity through conversations among the eight Persian Gulf littoral states along with Egypt, Jordan, Syria, and Turkey. Or they could establish a Middle East Network for Atomic Research and Advancement, which would create regional mechanisms for ensuring nonproliferation and nuclear disarmament while enhancing cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear technology among regional countries that reject nuclear weapons.

Iran has the region's greatest aggregate power and human, natural, and geostrategic resources, so it makes sense for it to help lead these initiatives. Tehran should also realize that its power can make others uncomfortable, and therefore the country should pivot from a narrative of building a “strong Iran”—which can appear unilateral and threatening—to a narrative of building a “strong region.” Iranian officials, for example, can reframe the country's scientific and cultural capacities as resources that can benefit all of West Asia rather than as proof of Iran's sway.

But the region's other states will need to play their own part in breaking the securitization cycle. To do so, they should focus on isolating the regional figure most responsible for securitizing Iran: Netanyahu. He and his allies have proved that they consider peace and tranquility to be an existential threat to their fortunes. This makes them unlike Iran, which—according to Article 2 of its constitution—was founded upon “rejection of all forms of oppression, submission to oppression, domination of others and submission to domination” and “utilization and further advancement of science, technology and advanced results of human experiences” that “bring about political, economic, social and cultural independence as well as equity, justice and national solidarity.”

Israel's recent behavior provides an opening for Iranian leaders. The horrific crimes in Gaza have resulted in a global outcry and awakened consciences across ideological barriers. But few governments have been more consistent in criticizing Israel and advocating for the Palestinians than Tehran. Iranian officials could thus work with international organizations and institutions—including the United Nations and the International Court of Justice—to foster global empathy and build a strong consensus against apartheid, genocide, and aggression. In doing so, Iran might be able to neutralize and possibly even reverse its securitization. It makes no sense for Iran to be securitized with accusations of nuclear proliferation when the leading proponent of those charges is a regime that possesses an illegal nuclear arsenal.

Iran's priority in foreign policy will always be its own neighborhood. Tehran, however, should also try to deepen its relationships elsewhere. That includes closely cooperating with Russia. Coordinating with China, which is a rising global powerhouse, is an absolute imperative. But Tehran could also benefit from improving relations with Europe and managing its differences with the United States. This would help ensure that Iran is a serious, equal, and long-term partner to China and Russia—and not just engaging with them out of imposed desperation.

Managing and containing differences with the United States may also be necessary for breaking the cycle of securitization. Perhaps no government has done as much to try to isolate Iran as has Washington. (Although no one has done as much as Israel to persuade the United States to be hostile toward Iran and Iranians.) Tehran should thus consider the possibility of renewed direct dialogue with Washington, based on equal footing. Expectations must be managed, as the objective of talks cannot be to restore friendly links between the two countries. Iran and the United States have intractable differences rooted in identity and ideology that neither can realistically concede: for Washington, this includes the nature of Iran's revolutionary political establishment and its stance on Israel; for Tehran, it includes Washington's blind support for Israel and its global presence. But by agreeing to disagree on these ideological quarrels, negotiators could manage to find ways to prevent them from triggering unnecessary crises. They can also resolve many of their political disputes through a mutual give-and-take.

At the top of the list is Iran's nuclear program and U.S. sanctions, the very nexus that the JCPOA was designed to address. The United States must realize that it cannot obliterate Iran's substantial capabilities, as most are indigenous and can be rebuilt. But both countries can agree on two shared objectives: Iran should never build nuclear weapons, and the United States should never threaten or engage in military and economic war against Iran. To those ends, Iran could offer transparency, limits on enrichment, and a possible regional mechanism, such as an enrichment consortium. The United States, for its part, would have to lift its own sanctions and permit the lifting of UN sanctions.



Iran could foster an agreement by being more transparent about its nuclear program through appropriate cooperation with the IAEA. Iranian officials are justifiably worried that any information they provide to the IAEA will be used for military targeting, given their belief that classified information has leaked from the organization in the past. The IAEA director's June remarks that Tehran had “not answered, or not provided technically credible answers to, the Agency's questions” was also misused by Israel to justify that month's bombing campaign. Iran thus has every right to demand that the IAEA be diligent in observing its own procedures and codes of conduct on impartiality, objectivity, confidentiality, and sensitivity to national security concerns in exchange for continued cooperation. But as long as they are managed, the risks of cooperation should be worth the payoffs. Transparency with the IAEA should halt the dissemination of unsubstantiated securitizing narratives around Iran and facilitate a political deal with the United States.

If Tehran and Washington do implement an updated nuclear agreement, the countries might also manage to address other difficult issues, such as regional security, arms control, and counterterrorism. Iran, for example, might be asked to promise that it will not attack the United States or its allies in the region in return for a reciprocal guarantee by the United States and its partners. Tehran might also promise that it will not use its military capabilities other than in self-defense against prior armed attack, based on a reciprocal commitment. The United States, however, would have to deal with Iran's security grievances, including its threatening presence around Iran and the unparalleled flooding of the region with sophisticated American weaponry. For all of Washington's fretting about Iran's defense procurement, Tehran spends only a fraction of what U.S. allies in the region do on military purchases in real, per capita, and GNP percentages.

Iran and the United States might also find that they have opportunities to actively aid each other. Iran, for example, boasts a strong network of universities; a large, well-educated population; and a thriving private sector, with long historical ties to global markets. In fact, it is one of the most untapped, stable, and lucrative economies anywhere. Together, Iran and the United States could thus cooperate on important scientific and technological issues.

Likewise, they might find areas of short-term foreign policy coordination. Tehran and Washington, despite their strategic differences, cooperated in Afghanistan and Iraq in the early years of this century and against the Islamic State (also known as ISIS) in more recent ones. Today, they again have mutual challenges in matters of extremism, as well as in threats to freedom of navigation. They could become avenues of at least short-term deconfliction, if not coordination. Iran and the United States would also benefit from some cooperation in the fight against international drug trafficking. Situated along the primary transit routes for narcotics originating in Afghanistan, Iran has borne a disproportionate share of the human and financial costs of counternarcotics efforts, including thousands of casualties among its law enforcement personnel. Quiet coordination, whether through intelligence sharing, technical assistance, or support for regional interdiction mechanisms, would address a shared security threat without requiring political alignment on broader ideological disputes.

The securitization cycle has placed Iran, the region, and NATO countries, particularly the United States, in a complex and self-reinforcing predicament. Iran's defensive and reactive measures, rather than reducing threats, have intensified securitized perceptions of Iran and helped advance the narrative that Tehran is dangerous. Breaking this cycle is a vital necessity for Tehran. The idea that Iran is an existential threat may be completely wrong. But this perception has created existential threats for Iranians—something the June attacks made painfully evident.

Escaping securitization requires a set of simultaneous, comprehensive, and coordinated strategies. It necessitates active and balanced regional and global diplomacy, internal reforms, domestic and international confidence-building measures, a pivot back to the ideational power of the Islamic Revolution, the nonprovocative strengthening of the country's defense capabilities, and a shift in strategic communications.

At the same time, breaking the securitization cycle is pivotal for the United States and Europe. They should start by engaging with Iran as a partner rather than a threat. They should remember that doing so will advance their own interests. By becoming ensnared in a belligerent, securitizing discourse against Iran, the United States and Europe have escalated regional and global tensions without achieving any of their stated objectives. They would be much better served respecting Iran's independence, dignity, and legitimate rights while redirecting their focus onto the main cause of instability in the region: Israel's unlawful and unconscionable behavior.

Iran is a natural mediator. Its culture, history, and location mean it can facilitate dialogue and cooperation between Asia and Europe. It can serve as a hub for trade, particularly with the landlocked states of Central Asia. Its human capital means it can be a major partner in global technological innovation. Breaking Iran's securitization cycle and allowing it to ascend to its rightful place will help yield peace, development, and stability for the decades.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","One small change in battery design could reduce fires, researchers say","https://www.cnn.com/science/new-battery-design-could-prevent-fires-spc","Mon, 22 Dec 2025 09:13:54 GMT","


            Lithium-ion batteries are found in everything from smartphones to cars, and while they are generally very safe if stored and charged correctly, there are thousands of documented cases of them catching fire — sometimes with deadly consequences.
    


            Lithium-ion batteries contain flammable electrolytes — liquid solutions of lithium salts dissolved in organic solvents that allow the electric charge to flow. The batteries can become unstable under certain conditions, such as physical damage like piercing, overcharging, extreme temperatures or manufacturing defects. When things go wrong, a battery can heat up and catch fire very rapidly, undergoing a dangerous chain reaction called a “thermal runaway.”
    


            Commercial aviation is especially exposed to the problem, because of how ubiquitous battery-powered gadgets are on planes and how dangerous a fire in the cabin or cargo hold can be. In the US, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has long prohibited carrying spare lithium-ion batteries in checked baggage and mandates that all batteries brought into the cabin must remain accessible. The agency recorded 89 battery incidents involving smoke, fire or extreme heat on passenger and cargo aircraft in 2024, and 38 in the first half of 2025.
    


            These incidents can lead to the total loss of an aircraft, like the Airbus A321 that was gutted by flames in January in Busan, South Korea. The fire was likely started by a power bank stored in an overhead compartment, according to investigators, which has led some airlines to ban the devices.
    


            But the risks of thermal runaways extend to homes, particularly vulnerable to e-bike or e-scooter battery fires, and businesses of all kinds: a survey conducted by insurance provider Aviva in 2024, among over 500 UK businesses found that just over half had experienced an incident linked to lithium-ion batteries, such as sparking, fires and explosions.
    


            Researchers all over the world are working to solve the problem by developing safer batteries, for example by replacing the liquid electrolyte with a more fire-resistant solid or gel. However, such solutions require significant changes to current production lines, an obstacle to widespread adoption.
    


            Now, a team of researchers from The Chinese University of Hong Kong has proposed a change in lithium-ion battery design that could rapidly integrate into current manufacturing methods, because it simply involves swapping chemicals in the existing electrolyte solution.
    


            The method was detailed earlier this year in a study led by Yue Sun, now a postdoctoral fellow at Virginia Tech: “I think the most difficult thing for people to realize about batteries is that when you try to optimize performance, sometimes you compromise safety,” she said, explaining that increasing performance requires a focus on chemical reactions that happen at room temperature, while increasing safety focuses on reactions that happen at high temperatures.
    


            “So we came up with an idea to break this trade off by designing a temperature-sensitive material, which can provide a good performance at room temperature, but can also offer good stability at high temperatures.”
    


            Battery fires generally start when part of the electrolyte breaks down under stress and releases heat in a chain reaction. Sun and her colleagues' design uses a new electrolyte that includes two solvents to stop this chain reaction in its tracks.
    


            At room temperature, the first solvent keeps the battery's chemical structure tight, optimizing performance, but if the battery starts to heat up, the second solvent takes over and prevents a fire by loosening that structure and slowing down reactions that could result in a thermal runaway.
    


            In lab tests, a battery with this new design that was pierced with a nail saw its temperature rise by only 3.5°C (38.3° Fahrenheit), instead of the 555°C (1,031° Fahrenheit) spike that occurred with a traditional battery. The researchers say there is no negative impact on the battery's performance or durability, and it retained over 80% of its capacity after 1,000 charging cycles.
    


            “Since our invention is the electrolyte, it can be easily implemented into commercially available systems — you basically just swap in the new electrolyte,” said Yi-Chun Lu, a professor of mechanical and automation engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, and one of the authors of the study.
    


            “In the manufacturing process, the most difficult aspect is the electrodes, or the solid part. But the electrolyte that we are swapping is a liquid, so you can directly inject it into the cell without any new equipment or new process,” Lu added.
    


            The new chemical recipe would slightly increase the manufacturing cost, but Lu said that at scale, the price would be “at a very similar level” to current batteries. The researchers are interested in pursuing the idea commercially, and are currently in discussion with battery manufacturers to bring the design to market, which could take between three to five years, according to Lu.
    


            In tests, the researchers made a battery large enough to power a tablet, but Lu said that there needs to be more “validation” to scale the design up to the size required for cars, for example.
    


            Researchers in the field of lithium battery safety who didn't participate in the study expressed positive views of the work when contacted by CNN for comment. Donal Finegan, a senior scientist at the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory, said in an email that the new design is an exciting development, and it translates into a safety battery that can tolerate hot conditions and short circuiting without causing a fire: “The strategically chosen electrolyte solution is scalable and does not significantly impede the cycle life of the battery, which helps eliminate many barriers towards mass adoption in commercial battery systems,” he added.
    


            The study explored a range of electrolyte compositions and found options where there was a balance between battery cells lasting many cycles while also maintaining stability at higher temperatures, according to Gary Koenig, a professor of chemical engineering at the University of Virginia. “From a manufacturing perspective, implementing a new electrolyte can be achieved in a relatively short timeframe as long as there is not an unforeseen processing compatibility issue,” he said in an email.
    


            Jorge Seminario, a professor of chemical engineering at Texas A&M University, said in an email that the new design addresses one of the most critical challenges in high-energy lithium-ion batteries, which is achieving both safety and performance: “The study is highly innovative and impactful, offering a practical solution to a critical bottleneck in lithium-ion battery safety,” he added.

            Drenching rain from an atmospheric river-fueled storm triggered deadly flooding and evacuations over the weekend in Northern California. It's the start of a hazardous holiday week for the state with multiple storms and months' worth of rain expected in Southern California.
    


            At least one person is dead after flash floods inundated Redding, roughly 150 miles north of Sacramento, according to Redding Mayor Mike Littau, who said police and fire crews carried out water rescues Sunday.
    


            A police officer pulled the victim from a flooded vehicle, Littau said Monday morning, though the official cause of death is still under investigation. Officials have not said how many water rescues were carried out in the city.
    


            Shasta County, where Redding is located, was hit particularly hard Sunday evening, with heavy rain flooding multiple roadways, including parts of Interstate 5, according to officials.
    


            Nearly a month's worth of rain fell in the Redding area Saturday through Sunday: One of the city's fire stations measured just over 5 inches of rain.
    


Redding police said they responded to “numerous calls for stranded motorists” and urged drivers to avoid flooded streets.
    


            Paul Mast posted video of his son standing in the middle of a Shasta County road flooded by a nearby creek. Mast said they were on their way to a family Christmas gathering but had to turn around because floodwater had washed out part of the road.
    


            Shasta County wasn't the only area underwater on Sunday: Crews also performed water rescues in Humboldt County, where the floodwater was chest-deep in some places.
    


            Farther east, in Placer County, rising water on the South Yuba River prompted evacuations. Officials issued warnings for multiple properties in Cisco Grove in the Sierra Nevada on Sunday and at least nine people were evacuated from one home there, according to the Placer County Sheriff's Office.
    


            More flooding rain, debris flows and rock slides are widespread concerns with this week's multiple storms. Strong winds that could potentially knock out power are also expected.
    


            Much of California is under a flood watch until Friday.
    


            Heavy, potentially flooding rain will continue to focus on Northern California into Tuesday, especially from the northern Sierra Nevada foothills into the Bay Area.
    


            Then another, more widespread storm steps up to the plate. This strong atmospheric river is set to slam the entire state Tuesday night into Wednesday.
    


            A Level 3 of 4 flooding rain threat is in place for more than 17 million people in Southern California on Wednesday, including the Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Santa Barbara metros, according to the Weather Prediction Center.
    


            Another atmospheric river will be right on its heels, keeping stormy conditions locked in over the state Thursday into Friday.
    


            Level 2 of 4 threats of flooding rain persist in much of the state on Thursday and Friday.
    


            Rainfall totals in Southern California through Saturday could be as much as 4 to 8 inches in coastal and valley locations, while foothills and mountains see 8 to 12 inches. 



            To put those totals into perspective, a city like Los Angeles could see anywhere from two months' worth of rain to nearly half a year's worth in just a week.
    


            The National Weather Service in Los Angeles warned of significant issues from the upcoming storms, including “widespread urban flooding, mud and debris flows and very hazardous driving conditions.”
    


            “START TAKING PROTECTIVE ACTIONS NOW,” the NWS urged Sunday night.
    


            Recent wildfire burn areas will be particularly prone to debris flows.
    


            The abundant moisture will also fuel feet of snow farther north in the Sierra Nevada and make travel there difficult or impossible at times. It will be a big change for the region, which has had much less snow than usual to start the season.
    


            Some relief from this nonstop stormy pattern looks to finally arrive for the upcoming weekend.

NEW YORK (AP) — The Senate's top Democrat urged his colleagues Monday to take legal action over the Justice Department's incremental and heavily redacted release of records pertaining to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Minority Leader Chuck Schumer introduced a resolution that, if passed, would direct the Senate to file or join lawsuits aimed at forcing the Justice Department to comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the law enacted last month that required disclosure of records by last Friday.

“Instead of transparency, the Trump administration released a tiny fraction of the files and blacked out massive portions of what little they provided,” Schumer, D-N.Y. said in a statement. “This is a blatant cover-up.”

In lieu of Republican support, Schumer's resolution is largely symbolic. The senate is off until Jan. 5, more than two weeks after the deadline. Even then, it'll likely face an uphill battle for passage. But it allows Democrats to continue a pressure campaign for disclosure that Republicans had hoped to put behind them.

The Justice Department said it plans to release records on a rolling basis by the end of the year. It blamed the delay on the time-consuming process of obscuring victims' names and other identifying information. So far, the department hasn't given any notice when new records arrive.

That approach angered some accusers and members of Congress who fought to pass the transparency act. Records that were released, including photographs, interview transcripts, call logs, court records and other documents, were either already public or heavily blacked out, and many lacked necessary context.




There were few revelations in the tens of thousands of pages of records that have been released so far. Some of the most eagerly awaited records, such as FBI victim interviews and internal memos shedding light on charging decisions, weren't there.

Nor were there any mentions of some powerful figures who've been in Epstein's orbit, like Britain's former Prince Andrew.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on Sunday defended the Justice Department's decision to release just a fraction of the files by the deadline as necessary to protect survivors of sexual abuse by the disgraced financier.

Blanche pledged that the Trump administration would meet its obligation required by law. But he stressed that the department was obligated to act with caution as it goes about making public thousands of documents that can include sensitive information.

Blanche, the Justice Department's second-in-command, also defended its decision to remove several files related to the case from its public webpage, including a photograph showing Trump, less than a day after they were posted.

The missing files, which were available Friday but no longer accessible by Saturday, included images of paintings depicting nude women, and one showed a series of photographs along a credenza and in drawers. In that image, inside a drawer among other photos, was a photograph of Trump, alongside Epstein, Melania Trump and Epstein's longtime associate, Ghislaine Maxwell.

Blanche said the documents were removed because they also showed victims of Epstein. Blanche said the Trump photo and the other documents will be reposted once redactions are made to protect survivors.

“We are not redacting information around President Trump, around any other individual involved with Mr. Epstein, and that narrative, which is not based on fact at all, is completely false,” Blanche told NBC's “Meet the Press.”

Blanche said Trump, a Republican, has labeled the Epstein matter “a hoax” because “there's this narrative out there that the Department of Justice is hiding and protecting information about him, which is completely false.”

“The Epstein files existed for years and years and years and you did not hear a peep out of a single Democrat for the past four years and yet ... lo and behold, all of a sudden, out of the blue, Senator Schumer suddenly cares about the Epstein files,” Blanche said. “That's the hoax.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Monday suspended leases for five large-scale offshore wind projects under construction along the East Coast due to what it said were national security risks identified by the Pentagon.

The suspension, effective immediately, is the latest step the administration has taken to hobble offshore wind in its push against renewable energy sources. It comes two weeks after a federal judge struck down President Donald Trump's executive order blocking wind energy projects, calling it unlawful.

The administration said the pause will give the Interior Department, which oversees offshore wind, time to work with the Defense Department and other agencies to assess the possible ways to mitigate any security risks posed by the projects. The statement did not detail the national security risks. It called the move a pause, but did not specify an end date. 

“The prime duty of the United States government is to protect the American people,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement. “Today's action addresses emerging national security risks, including the rapid evolution of the relevant adversary technologies, and the vulnerabilities created by large-scale offshore wind projects with proximity near our east coast population centers.”

Wind proponents slammed the move, saying it was another blow in an ongoing attack by the administration against clean energy. The administration's decision to cite potential national security risks could complicate legal challenges to the move, although wind supporters say those arguments are overstated.

AP correspondent Marcela Sanchez reports on which offshore wind projects are being put on hold and why.




The administration said leases are paused for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind in Rhode Island and Connecticut, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind.

The Interior Department said unclassified reports from the U.S. government have long found that the movement of massive turbine blades and the highly reflective towers create radar interference called “clutter.” The clutter caused by offshore wind projects obscures legitimate moving targets and generates false targets in the vicinity of wind projects, the Interior Department said.

National security expert and former Commander of the USS Cole Kirk Lippold disputed the administration's national security argument. The offshore projects were awarded permits “following years of review by state and federal agencies,” including the Coast Guard, the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, the Air Force and more, he said.

“The record of decisions all show that the Department of Defense was consulted at every stage of the permitting process,” Lippold said, arguing that the projects would benefit national security because they would diversify the country's energy supply.

The administration's action comes two weeks after a federal judge struck down Trump's executive order blocking wind energy projects, saying the effort to halt virtually all leasing of wind farms on federal lands and waters was “arbitrary and capricious” and violates U.S. law. 

Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump's Jan. 20 executive order blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful. 

Saris ruled in favor of a coalition of state attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, that challenged Trump's Day One order that paused leasing and permitting for wind energy projects.

Trump has been hostile to renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and prioritizes fossil fuels to produce electricity. 

Wind supporters called the administration's actions illegal and said offshore wind provides some of the most affordable, reliable electric power to the grid.

“For nearly a year, the Trump administration has recklessly obstructed the build-out of clean, affordable power for millions of Americans, just as the country's need for electricity is surging,” said Ted Kelly of the Environmental Defense Fund.

“Now the administration is again illegally blocking clean, affordable energy,” Kelly said. “We should not be kneecapping America's largest source of renewable power, especially when we need more cheap, homegrown electricity.''

The administration's actions are especially egregious because, at the same time, it is propping up aging, expensive coal plants “that barely work and pollute our air,” Kelly said.

Connecticut Attorney General William Tong called the lease suspension a “lawless and erratic stop-work order” that revives an earlier failed attempt to halt construction of Revolution Wind. 

The wind project has been vetted and approved through every layer of federal and state regulatory process, including a careful review of security issues raised in the latest announcement, he said.

“Every day this project is stalled is another day of lost work, another day of unaffordable energy costs, and other day burning fossil fuels when American-made clean energy is within reach,” Tong said. “We are evaluating all legal options, and this will be stopped just like last time.” 

A New Jersey group that opposes offshore wind hailed the administration's actions.

“Today, the president and his administration put America first,'' said Robin Shaffer, president of Protect Our Coast New Jersey, a nonprofit advocacy group.

“Placing largely foreign-owned wind turbines along our coastlines was never acceptable,” he said, arguing that the projects posed serious national security risks.

But the Conservation Law Foundation, a Boston-based environmental group, called the pause “a desperate rerun of the Trump administration's failed attempt to kill offshore wind,'' noting that courts have already rejected the administration's arguments.

“Trying again to halt these projects tramples on the rule of law, threatens jobs and deliberately sabotages a critical industry that strengthens — not weakens — America's energy security,” said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the law foundation.

MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — A man accused of killing 15 people at Sydney's Bondi Beach conducted firearms training in an area of New South Wales state outside of Sydney with his father, according to Australian police documents released on Monday.

The documents, made public following Naveed Akram's video court appearance from a Sydney hospital where he has been treated for an abdominal injury, said the two men recorded footage justifying the meticulously planned attack.

Officers wounded Akram at the scene of the Dec. 14 shooting and killed his father, 50-year-old Sajid Akram.

The state government confirmed Naveed Akram was transferred Monday from a hospital to a prison. Authorities identified neither facility.

The 24-year-old and his father began their attack by throwing four improvised explosive devices toward a crowd celebrating an annual Jewish event at Bondi Beach, but the devices failed to explode, the documents said.

Police described the devices as three aluminum pipe bombs and a tennis ball bomb containing an explosive, gunpowder and steel ball bearings. None detonated, but police described them as “viable” IEDs.




The pair had rented a room in the Sydney suburb of Campsie for three weeks before they left at 2:16 a.m. on the day of the attack. CCTV recorded them carrying what police allege were two shotguns, a rifle, five IEDs and two homemade Islamic State group flags wrapped in blankets.




Police also released images of the gunmen shooting from a footbridge, providing them with an elevated vantage point and the protection of waist-high concrete walls.

The largest IED was found after the gun battle near the footbridge in the trunk of the son's car, which had been left draped with the flags.

Authorities have charged Akram with 59 offenses, including 15 counts of murder, 40 counts of causing harm with intent to murder in relation to the wounded survivors and one count of committing a terrorist act.

The antisemitic attack at the start of the eight-day Hanukkah celebration was Australia's worst mass shooting since a lone gunman killed 35 people in Tasmania state in 1996.

The New South Wales government introduced draft laws to Parliament on Monday that Premier Chris Minns said would become the toughest in Australia.

The new restrictions would include making Australian citizenship a condition of qualifying for a firearms license. That would have excluded Sajid Akram, who was an Indian citizen with a permanent resident visa.

Sajid Akram also legally owned six rifles and shotguns. A new legal limit for recreational shooters would be a maximum of four guns.

Police said a video found on Naveed Akram's phone shows him with his father expressing “their political and religious views and appear to summarise their justification for the Bondi terrorist attack.” 

The men are seen in the video “condemning the acts of Zionists” while they also “adhere to a religiously motivated ideology linked to Islamic State,” police said.

Video shot in October shows them “firing shotguns and moving in a tactical manner” on grassland surrounded by trees, police said.

“There is evidence that the Accused and his father meticulously planned this terrorist attack for many months,” police allege.

An impromptu memorial that grew near the Bondi Pavilion after the massacre, as thousands of mourners brought flowers and heartfelt cards, was removed Monday as the beachfront returned to more normal activity. The Sydney Jewish Museum will preserve part of the memorial.

Victims' funerals continued Monday with French national Dan Elkayam's service held in the nearby suburb of Woollahra, at the heart of Sydney's Jewish life. The 27-year-old moved from Paris to Sydney a year ago.

The health department said 12 people wounded in the attack remained in hospitals on Monday.

TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — The suspect in a deadly knife and grenade attack that left three dead and 11 wounded in Taiwan's capital meticulously planned the assault for more than a year, police said Monday.

The attacker, identified as 27-year-old Chang Wen, indiscriminately stabbed passers-by and launched smoke grenades on Friday at a Taipei metro station and on the street before running into a department store. He fell to his death from the fifth floor of the store while being pursued by police.

The assaults shocked Taiwan, where violent crime is rare, prompting authorities to step up security at crowded spots and large events.

As he carried out the attack in multiple phases, Chang changed his clothing and modes of transportation several times, going from a scooter to a bike to walking, police said. In the process, he set fire to his apartment, to roads and caused damage to cars and motorbikes.

“He was extremely cunning,” Li Hsi-Ho, chief of Taipei's police, said during a news conference Monday.

Li said the suspect had been preparing the assault since April 2024 by buying smoke grenades, gas canisters, respirators and other tools.

“He had been planning the crime for a year and a half, and his motive for the crime also began a year and a half ago,” Li said.

Authorities were still investigating his motive but said the suspect had been wanted since July after failing to report to military service. He had previously served voluntarily in the military but had been fired for drunken driving.

He had not contacted his family for more than two years, authorities said.

Five injured people remained in the hospital and one of them was in intensive care but in stable condition after surgery, authorities said.

ATLANTA (AP) — Millennial and Generation Z Christian influencers are increasingly filling a void in American religion, growing audiences across digital platforms by steering young people to biblical answers to tough questions that aren't always answered in Sunday sermons.

“I can be that in-between — Monday to Saturday help — to give you practical things to make you feel like you're not walking this walk alone,” said Megan Ashley, 35, sitting cross-legged in sweats on the couch where she records her “In Totality” podcast. 

From myriad backgrounds, these influencers talk candidly to their listeners about everything from anxieties and doubts to dating and culture, delving into the Bible's complexities. Those of faith say Christian influencers are galvanizing young people looking for meaning in a culture that lacks it at a time when years of declining church attendance has slowed.

“What they're making accessible is a truth that transforms people,” said Lecrae Moore, a Christian rapper and podcaster. “There's something that's happening existentially — supernaturally — that I can't explain.”

Ashley and Moore are among a half-dozen popular influencers who described their work for this story. With and without formal theological training, they describe themselves as churchgoers who don't want their messages boxed in by denominational labels.

Some grew up in church; others didn't, but they commonly describe experiencing a spiritual transformation that came out of hardship or a sense of emptiness they pin on secular lifestyles.

“We're like, listen, we're two mess-ups too. It's OK,” said Arielle Reitsma, 36, co-host of podcast “Girls Gone Bible,” which gets more than a million listens or streams each month.

These algorithm-savvy podcasters fit comfortably in a long tradition of Christian celebrities, said Zachary Sheldon, a Baylor University lecturer on media, religion and culture who cited televangelist Billy Graham as an example. Working independently, they can harness audiences more easily than established congregations and media organizations can.

“Exposing people to the faith and challenging them to ask questions and search for something more” are really good things to do, Sheldon said. But he pointed to “potential dangers in granting them too much authority on the basis of their celebrity and their acumen with social media.”

These influencers encourage church attendance and describe reaching a variety of people, including those who have been particularly disconnected from religion, which polls show is a growing number of young Americans. Only 41% of people ages 18-35 surveyed in 2023-24 said they believe in God with certainty, down from 65% in 2007, according to the Pew Research Center.

“People are spiritually hungry, emotionally hungry, and I think for the first time ever … people are encountering Jesus even through online platforms, and they're realizing, this is true life and fulfillment,” said Angela Halili, 29, Reitsma's co-host. 

The pair now draws live crowds since starting the podcast more than two years ago. At an event in Atlanta, they warned hundreds of fans against idolizing work or relationships, Bibles in hand, and recounted their days as Hollywood actors battling addiction, heartbreak and mental health disorders. Halili said God brought them “radical healing,” and they want listeners to know that God can perform “miracles” in their lives, too.

Afterward, they hugged and prayed for people in the audience, where Anna Williams, 17, said she considers both Reitsma and Halili to be “a big sister” in her life.





Even as they espouse biblical principles as guidance toward true joy, influencers say that being Christian can be hard.

God “does make everything better, but that doesn't always come in the way that we think it's gonna come,” said “In Totality” host Ashley.

Her current obsession, which she teaches with fervor, is a biblical passage about living as a sacrifice. God asks people to give up certain wants and behaviors so they can grow closer to him, Ashley says. She said her intensity grew after a healing encounter with God's “severity” as a freshly divorced single mom plagued by suicidal thoughts and depression.

Bible themes, heavier challenges, day-to-day plights as well as topics like parenting and Black culture are covered on “With the Perrys,” a podcast led by husband and wife authors and spoken-word artists who also run a streetwear brand.

“It is the all — how do we do all of this stuff in this weird flesh and weird world?” said Jackie Hill Perry, 36.

She is an admired speaker who is working towards her seminary degree and wrote a book about leaving behind same-sex relationships. She and husband Preston Perry, 39, started podcasting in 2019. Followers already resonated with Perry's theological debates and story of growing up around poverty and violence before finding faith and becoming a Christian evangelist. 

“God calls us to ruffle feathers sometimes, to speak to culture,” Perry said.

In a recent episode, the Perrys urged listeners to be honest with God about struggling to trust him. Through focused prayer, obedience and Bible reading, God brings lasting peace, answers and growth during hard circumstances, they say, but this requires more than quick fixes like scrolling and sex. 

At just 22, Bryce Crawford teaches Bible chapters on his self-named podcast and posts videos of himself talking to people about Christianity at Pride parades, the Burning Man counter-culture festival and a satanic temple.

Rather than shout “repent,” Crawford's street evangelism aims to change minds through kindness. His followers say they're attracted by his empathetic yet bold demeanor while delivering talking points against lifestyles such as same-sex marriage.

“My issue with ‘repent or burn in hell' is that people get frustrated because they don't know why you're telling them that,” said Crawford, who describes being severely anxious and bitter toward God until God healed him at a Waffle House. “Our tactics have been one-on-one conversations, calmly listening, asking questions because we care about them, and in that explaining our worldview.”



These influencers acknowledge that online Christianity has its challenges.

A hyperfocus on online drama and Christianity's more esoteric beliefs can miss the basics, such as love and Christ's sacrifice, Hill Perry said. She worries that “simply talking about gentleness or respect or kindness or patience is gonna be boring” to people.

And the deep political and cultural rifts among Christians emerge online too.

For example, Halili and Reitsma got pushback for taking the opportunity to pray at a pre-inauguration rally for President Donald Trump. The Perrys have been criticized by conservatives for talking about police brutality and racial injustice, and liberals for expressing opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion.

Some followers say these influencers provide a welcome alternative to the buttoned-up pastors they grew up with who spoke of God as a faraway deity that would reject them for breaking too many rules.

“I really needed someone who was a younger Black female portraying something that wasn't super traditional,” said Olivia Singleton, 24. She's involved with her church and likes her pastor, but feels like these influencers are like “one of the girls … walking out the faith with you.”

Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., posted on X that former NASCAR star Greg Biffle and his family were on board a plane that reportedly crashed on the way to the Bahamas on ‘The Will Cain Show.'

Tragedy struck the world of NASCAR on Thursday when a plane carrying former racing star Greg Biffle, members of his family and others crashed in North Carolina.

The plane was returning to the Statesville Regional Airport roughly 10 minutes after takeoff for an ""emergency landing."" Biffle, 55, was killed alongside his wife, Cristina, and children Ryder, 5, and Emma, 14. Three other people killed on board were identified as Dennis Dutton, his son Jack and Craig Wadsworth.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was still investigating the cause of the crash.

Davey Allison, the son of legendary NASCAR driver Bobby Allison, was a rising star in NASCAR when the helicopter he was piloting crashed in the infield at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama. The crash occurred in July 1993 – just a few months after Kulwicki died. The NTSB blamed the crash on Allison's inexperience as a pilot.

Thurman Munson was on his way to becoming the next great New York Yankees catcher. He won the 1970 American League Rookie of the Year and the MVP in 1976. He was named the team's first captain since Lou Gehrig. He bought a plane so he could fly it back to Ohio, his home, on his off days. He was practicing landings when he clipped a tree on the approach to Akron-Canton-Regional Airport in 1979. Munson was paralyzed on impact and suffocated in a fire that ensued.

January 2020 had one of the darkest and most unfathomable moments in sports. Kobe Bryant, his daughter and seven others were on a helicopter flying back from a basketball tournament in California when the aircraft crashed outside of Los Angeles. The NTSB blamed the pilot for the cause of the crash.

In 2019, Halladay crashed a sport plane he had purchased into the Gulf of Mexico. The NTSB said he was impaired by high levels of amphetamines and was attempting extreme aerobatic stunts when he lost control of the aircraft.

Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says the Ability Hand brings real touch, natural movement and unmatched durability.

At 18, Jamie Grohsong was living a dream many young athletes chase for years. He was a three-time all-conference shortstop, a Division I college prospect and a player who lived for the game. Then one Fourth of July night in 2023, everything changed. A firework exploded in his hand. In seconds, Jamie lost his pitching hand, his season and what felt like his entire baseball future. The path he had worked toward since childhood disappeared. For a while, Jamie accepted that reality. Baseball, the sport that shaped his identity, was over.

AI-POWERED BAT TRACKING COULD GIVE BASEBALL PLAYERS THE EDGE

Two years later, Jamie stepped back onto a baseball field wearing something he never imagined using. A bionic prosthetic known as the Ability Hand.

""The fact that I can feel and sense everything to the finest details opened my mind to the possibility of everything that could actually be done,"" he told CyberGuy. 

The goal was not to recreate the past. It was to find out what might still be possible.

Engineers who build advanced prosthetic hands saw Jamie's story and reached out with a simple question. What if he did not have to give up the game entirely? That question started an extraordinary journey that blended grit, patience and cutting-edge engineering.

""When building the Ability Hand, we prioritized real-life usage,"" Dr. Aadeel Akhtar, founder and CEO of PSYONIC, told CyberGuy. ""While we already put the hand through its fair share of stress tests, baseball is a whole different ball game."" 

Baseball is definitely a brutal test for any piece of equipment. Throwing requires precise release timing. Hitting demands force, stability and follow-through. At first, nothing came easily.

Throwing a baseball with a bionic hand is not about raw strength. It is about timing and grip. The Ability Hand uses muscle sensors that detect subtle movements in the arm. During a throw, many muscles activate at once, which can cause the hand to open too early. Early throws slipped away. Some felt right. Others did not.

Instead of forcing the hand to grip harder, the PSYONIC team adjusted the technique. Jamie learned to hold the ball lightly and let momentum release it naturally. Small grip changes made a real difference. Slowly, throws began to land. Then they became repeatable. For Jamie, each clean throw rebuilt confidence that had been missing for two years.

3D PRINTED CORNEA RESTORES SIGHT IN WORLD FIRST

Just as Jamie started throwing again, another door opened. He received an invitation to throw the ceremonial first pitch at the San Francisco Giants' Oracle Park. It was the team he grew up watching. The timeline was tight. He had barely over a week to prepare.

The pitch was not perfect. That never mattered. Standing on a Major League Baseball field with a bionic hand, Jamie proved something bigger than accuracy. He showed that the game was still part of him. Later, he said the experience taught him that life does not require perfection to be meaningful.

FULLY IMPLANTABLE BRAIN CHIP AIMS TO RESTORE REAL SPEECH

Throwing was only part of the challenge. Hitting posed an even bigger question. 

""Swinging a bat was a feeling I didn't think I'd feel again,"" Jamie said.

Engineers discovered that bat placement matters more with prosthetics than with natural hands. When the bionic hand serves as the bottom hand on the bat, impact spreads across the fingers. When it sits on top, stress concentrates on the thumb. Jamie bats left-handed, which placed the prosthetic in a safer position. He told CyberGuy, ""I can hit with this thing for sure.""

Then came the first swings. The sensation was unfamiliar. The contact felt strange. Still, the bat met the ball. One swing turned into another. Soon, balls started flying deep into the field. Then it happened. Jamie sent one over the fence.

Those swings marked what many believe to be the first documented home runs hit using a multi-articulating bionic hand. For Jamie, it was more than a technical milestone. It was emotional closure and a new beginning at the same time. He was not trying to prove that prosthetics make athletes better. He was proving that they can help people reconnect with what they love. The bionic hand did not replace his identity. It gave him a new way to express it.

SMART FABRIC MUSCLES COULD CHANGE HOW WE MOVE

Jamie's comeback highlights a larger truth about modern assistive technology. At its best, design focuses on real-life use rather than lab conditions. Even so, advanced prosthetics remain expensive and imperfect, and they can break under stress. Because of that, users need time, training and patience to adapt. Yet stories like this show how powerful thoughtful engineering can be when it works alongside human determination. Ultimately, this is not about superhero moments but about access, persistence and refusing to let one moment define a lifetime.

Jamie Grohsong's journey back to baseball is not a story about beating the odds. It is a story about redefining them. With support, innovation and relentless effort, he found a way back to the field on his own terms. Technology did not give him his old life back. It helped him build a new one that still includes the game he loves.

Senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss newly reported details surrounding the two terrorists that killed 15 victims in Bondi Beach, Australia.

The terror attack in Australia has renewed urgent warnings from intelligence officials and counterterrorism experts that global jihadist networks are intensifying their reach, even as Western governments continue to frame groups like ISIS as weakened or in retreat.

Bill Roggio, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and one of the longest-running trackers of jihadist movements, said the Australia attack highlights a persistent miscalculation in Western capitals.

""We've always been quick to declare terrorist organizations defeated and insignificant, and that couldn't be further from the truth,"" Roggio told Fox News Digital.

Roggio, who is also managing editor of The Long War Journal, said ISIS remains far from dismantled despite the collapse of its territorial ""caliphate.""

""This attack in Australia is absolute proof that the Islamic State hasn't been defeated,"" he said. ""These groups are still able to recruit and indoctrinate people. They still have safe havens.""

He pointed to ISIS' enduring presence in Afghanistan. ""I just read the U.N. report. There are 2,000 ISIS fighters there, according to the United Nations,"" Roggio said. ""That's not what a defeated group looks like.""

Israeli officials say the threat revealed in Australia is part of a broader global pattern. Over the past year, they said, plots have been attempted or disrupted across Europe, North America, and elsewhere — signaling an escalating jihadist resurgence rather than isolated bursts of violence.

Corri Zoli, a research associate at Syracuse University's Forensic and National Security Sciences Institute, said Western governments cannot ignore the indicators.

""Governments are on notice that there is a steep rise in the terrorist targeting of religious minorities, particularly those from the Jewish faith community and Israelis worldwide — a trend intelligence agencies say has accelerated in the aftermath of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas massacre, which killed more than 1,200 people in Israel,"" Zoli said.

Roggio agrees the Israel–Hamas war has supercharged radicalization and emboldened extremists worldwide.

""With Israel's war against Hamas, it's given new life for people to attack Jews worldwide,"" Roggio said. ""It's a further reason to radicalize.""

BYSTANDERS SEEN CONFRONTING AUSTRALIAN GUNMAN DURING ISIS-INSPIRED DEADLY RAMPAGE

Intelligence officials told Fox News Digital that extremist actors across ideological lines are leveraging the conflict to inspire supporters, amplify propaganda and justify attacks in the West. Terrorist organizations, they said, are adapting quickly — merging digital incitement with on-the-ground recruitment networks.

""Analysts at West Point's Combating Terrorism Center warn these networks are probing for openings in Europe, Australia, Canada and the United States, exploiting ideological ecosystems that can radicalize individuals far from traditional battlefields,"" Zoli said.

Zoli also noted that Australian authorities had acknowledged that the attacker's family had been on the radar of domestic intelligence. Zoli said the son ""Was known to Australian officials for his extremism since 2019 and his association with extremist imam Wissam Haddad, a habitual violator of Australia's racial hatred laws at the Al Madina Dawah Centre and a prominent figure in the Street Dawah Movement. [He] also maintained close ties to Isaac El Matari, who claimed to be an Australian ISIS commander and is currently serving jail time for insurgency and firearms offenses,"" she said.

Roggio rejects the notion that individuals like the two of them should be viewed as ""lone wolves.""

""I disagree with that whole ‘lone wolf' terminology,"" he said, arguing that extremist ecosystems continue to provide ideological motivation, guidance and validation even when attackers act alone.

A senior intelligence source put it even more starkly: ""Today is ISIS, tomorrow is Iran.""

Roggio also stressed that the threat is not confined to ISIS but spans an interconnected web of jihadist actors.

""This isn't just the Islamic State. It's al Qaeda,"" he said. ""We were quick to declare al Qaeda defeated in Afghanistan. You read the U.N. reports, they're still there. They're in bed with the Taliban."" ""These groups aren't defeated,"" he added. ""They're just operating differently.""

Morgan Murphy, a national security expert and former Trump White House official, and current U.S. Senate candidate in Alabama, told Fox News Digital that ""Because of an unprecedented influx of unvetted, Islamist, fighting-age male migrants into both Europe and the United States, the West now faces a threat from within. That internal risk undermines our global leadership and drains resources that should be used to defend freedom abroad. This is a national security disaster created by the shortsighted policies of leaders like President Obama and Chancellor Angela Merkel, who welcomed so-called refugees without considering the long-term consequences for Western society.""

""Just because we want to declare the war against terror over doesn't mean it's over,"" Roggio said. ""We wanted to end our involvement in these wars, but the enemy gets a vote. That's what we just saw in Australia.""

The medical profession is at a crossroads. For decades, the medical establishment has insisted that so-called “gender-affirming care” for minors is settled science, despite weak evidence. Now, as the truth about the dangers is becoming impossible to ignore, a recent change from a California hospital system is signaling a shift from ideological obedience to evidence-based accountability in the medical profession. 

Sutter Health, a health system with 25 acute care hospitals and over 200 clinics across northern and central California, quietly announced on Nov. 20 that it will stop providing “gender-affirming care” services to minor patients under age 19, beginning on or around Dec. 10. 

This is the fourth California system to make changes this year following President Donald Trump's Jan. 28 executive order that ended any federal funding or support of “transition” for individuals under 19 years old and promised to enforce laws that limit or ban those practices. Children's Hospital L.A., Stanford Medicine, and Kaiser Permanente have announced changes in compliance with that order, but for Sutter Health to do so is shocking. It was recognized as a leader in LGBT healthcare equality by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation last year.

TRUMP'S ‘ALCOHOLIC'S PERSONALITY COMES THROUGH: WHITE HOUSE REPORT CARD

Just a week prior to the announcement, California Attorney General Rob Bonta released guidance on the rights individuals and providers have regarding “gender-affirming care,” assuring providers that they are legally protected to practice gender medicine in the state. So why give in now? 

The day before Sutter Health's announcement, the Department of Health and Human Services released the most comprehensive review of the data on gender medicine for minors. It concluded that there is not enough research to fully understand the outcomes and that the long-term risks likely outweigh alleged benefits.

There are major risks associated with gender medicine, including weakened bone density, infertility, sexual dysfunction, cognitive decline, psychiatric disorders, and surgical complications. The available research is also very limited, with few randomized control trials, small sample sizes, homogenous groups, and short follow-up periods. This calls into question the credibility of any possible benefits. Other countries — such as New Zealand, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and Denmark — have come to the same conclusions on the evidence and have already abandoned gender medicine for minors.

Despite this international momentum and recent federal pressure from the Trump administration, medical associations have stood by their support of gender medicine for minors. For example, the Endocrine Society, which declared its support in 2017 when it released a report and practice guidelines on the subject, reaffirmed its support in 2024. The Endocrine Society also criticized the HHS report; however, it used many of the same studies HHS did.

Most notably, both reports highlighted the Dutch Protocol, a series of widely criticized studies that is popularly used as supportive evidence for youth gender medicine. The Endocrine Society does discuss the limitations of the evidence in its report. In fact, in its summary of recommendations section, seven of the 10 recommendations are labeled as being based on very low- or low-quality evidence, as are all 12 suggestions.

DECLINE AND FALL OF TRANSGENDER AMERICA

This shows that it is political ideology and self-interest that have been motivating health professionals' actions over the past decade. But the medical profession is finally breaking away. For Sutter Health to stop providing gender medicine services to minors signals a deep shift toward acknowledging that experimental gender medicine is not compassionate care, but extremely harmful.

This moment marks the beginning of a broader reckoning, one in which treatment for gender dysphoria is based on evidence and the medical profession recommits to its duty of doing no harm. Hopefully, more health systems and medical professionals around the country will follow this courageous example of putting patients and their health above all else.

Media conglomerates want the president's permission for mergers—and control of news outlets is at stake.

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

The fate of Warner Bros. Discovery is no longer a regulatory matter. It is a medieval tournament, in which the king invites rival bidders to compete for his approval. To acquire the media company, the aspirants—Paramount and Netflix—will have to offer a sacrifice: Whoever can damage CNN the most stands to walk away with the prize.

This is one of those moments in Donald Trump's presidency when an event that would otherwise be recognized as a death knell for democracy somehow fails to elicit the outrage it deserves. Warner Bros. Discovery owns CNN, whose coverage Trump views as hostile to his administration. So he is abusing the government's merger-approval power in order to insist that the next owner of the venerable outlet mold its journalism to his liking.

Read: The apocalyptic potential of the Netflix–Warner Bros. Deal

Such coercion isn't just the product of Trump's brazen indifference to procedural restraints; it's possible because the underlying business of the media has become terrifyingly vulnerable to coercion. Recent history is a study in false promise. After the explosion of cable and the internet in the 1990s—technologies that promised radical decentralization—the media sector reconsolidated. Google and Meta devoured the advertising market that once sustained journalism: The United States now has just three newspapers that provide deep, authoritative national coverage; local outlets have closed by the thousands. Six television streaming services command nearly 90 percent of the audience—and, no matter which bidder Trump favors, those six stand to become five.

That tendency toward consolidation always posed a danger: As the number of competitors shrinks, an aspiring authoritarian can far more easily commandeer the system. But the specific architecture of modern media conglomerates creates a unique fragility. Many are burdened by debt; all are subject to government regulation. These companies are not just concentrated—they are compromised. Their weaknesses tempt them to submit to the undemocratic whims of the president.

Even if a small and shrinking fraction of the country watches cable news, Trump is a member of that cohort of aging, politically obsessed couch potatoes. And he is unmistakably fixated on how he is portrayed on those networks, especially CNN. That's a fact that David Ellison, the CEO of Paramount, has exploited in his bid to acquire Warner Bros. According to The Wall Street Journal, Ellison conveyed to Trump that he would overhaul the network if the president allows him to buy it.

It wasn't a hollow promise. Ellison—the son of Larry, the founder of the software giant Oracle and a Trump supporter—was already building a media empire that is more sympathetic to the president, or at least less hostile. After he bought CBS earlier this year, he installed new leadership to propel its news division rightward.

The early signs are ominous. Last week, Trump complained on Truth Social that 60 Minutes was treating him “far worse since the so-called ‘takeover' than they have ever treated me before.” On Sunday, CBS suddenly pulled a 60 Minutes segment about Trump's policy of deporting people to an infamous prison in El Salvador. The story, according to correspondence reviewed by The New York Times, had been fully vetted and was ready to air. Bari Weiss, the new head of the news division, said that she wanted producers to add context to the piece. Regardless of whether Ellison shares the president's politics, he has an incentive to crush CBS's independence and similarly renovate CNN, because the ultimate success of his conglomerate hinges on Trump blessing his bid for Warner Bros.

Not that long ago, media conglomerates weren't nearly so politically pliable. When Katharine Graham ran the Washington Post Company, she controlled a local monopoly, whose fate did not hinge on regulatory favor. That insulation—not merely her sense of civic duty—is what enabled the Post to defy Richard Nixon's efforts to suppress the Pentagon Papers. Even when Nixon allies challenged the broadcast licenses of her company's television stations during the Watergate era, Graham could resist shareholder pressure to bend. Her family owned a special class of shares, so it retained control of the company. And television was a secondary asset, not the foundation of the company's health.

A large chunk of today's conglomerates lack that insulation. Their profit margins are thinner. They scrape for growth in stagnant markets. In newer markets, they face brutal competition: With the exception of Netflix, streaming has yet to prove itself as a stable replacement for the businesses it cannibalized.

Survival, therefore, is contingent on consolidation. Having acquired Paramount, David Ellison understood that owning a giant conglomerate wasn't enough to create a viable competitor. His company still lacked the audience, the library depth, and the global footprint to vie with the likes of Netflix, Disney, or Amazon for dominance of the streaming market. Paramount could never grow enough organically, because subscriber growth has slowed across the industry. That left one path: buying scale. The whale that is Warner Bros. Discovery—one of the last conglomerates with a massive vault of beloved shows—is not a vanity purchase, but a business imperative.

Because the modern media conglomerate is so dependent on mergers, it is uniquely dependent on the state, which has the power to approve or nix them. That means the industry is uniquely dependent on Donald Trump.

During the first Trump administration, the president blustered about his desire to block Time Warner's merger with AT&T—and his Justice Department set out to fulfill his wishes in court. (Trump's disdain for CNN, then part of Time Warner, was reportedly the basis for his opposition.) But the judiciary deemed the deal perfectly legal.

The days when corporations could turn to saviors in robes feels like another era. The whole system, including the courts, can no longer be counted on to provide a buffer against Trump. Over the past several months, Trump has transformed once-independent agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission into extensions of his will. (And the Supreme Court is likely to lend its imprimatur to this power grab in the Trump v. Slaughter decision it will hand down next year.) Those agencies were created, exuding the ethos of the Progressive era, with a simple mandate: to make technocratic decisions that transcend partisanship. That is why they were required to be bipartisan in composition. Strip them of that independence, and regulatory approval becomes something closer to royal favor.

Media conglomerates have internalized the new reality. Brendan Carr, the FCC commissioner, demanded that broadcast companies “take action” against Jimmy Kimmel as retribution for views the administration deemed noxious; he was picking at a vulnerability. Nexstar, a company that owns more than 200 local stations, was in the process of buying Tegna, which owns 64 of them. To expedite the FCC's approval of its deal, Nexstar seemed to preemptively do Carr's bidding by pulling Kimmel's show from the ABC stations it owned. (Nine days later, it restored the show.)

Even a behemoth like Disney has little leverage—it has its own difficulties to surmount. The golden days of ESPN raking in profit from cable bundling and Marvel scoring box-office hits are over. Having bought Comcast's stake in Hulu, Disney is now under immense pressure to prove to its shareholders the wisdom of its streaming bet. Furthermore, when Florida Governor Ron DeSantis threatened to eliminate the autonomous “improvement district” that had long allowed Walt Disney World to govern itself, he exposed the parent company's vulnerability to regulators. All of that breeds an instinct to genuflect before Trump—which Disney did when it paid his presidential library $15 million to settle his defamation suit against ABC's George Stephanopoulos.

Given the declining reliance of traditional media outlets today, this might seem like an antiquated concern. But the crisis of democracy is a crisis of information—citizens make bad decisions, in part, because they are starved of the facts. And it can get worse.

Anne Applebaum: America's future is Hungary

A portion of the media will travel down the Hungarian path as Trump follows the example set by Viktor Orbán, who forced the transfer of outlets to his allies, effectively blunting a source of opposition. But the greater risk is that conglomerates simply give up on news entirely. Comcast has already shed MSNBC, dumping the network, now called MS NOW, into a spin-off composed of fossilized cable channels. Even before Netflix and Paramount began circling Warner Bros., it developed plans to similarly maroon CNN in a castaway company, isolating it from the parts of the empire better poised for growth. Journalism has become the epitome of a high-risk, low-return proposition—one that conglomerates seem to prefer expunging from their portfolios.

The grim reality is that as American media shrinks, Trump's coercion yields an outsize return. When Jeff Bezos neutralized The Washington Post's editorial page—after Trump threatened his other commercial interests—he didn't just quiet a single outlet; he neutered the institutional voice of one of the three remaining national newspapers. And if Trump succeeds in remaking or destroying CNN, he won't just be wounding a network. The president will have effectively dismantled one of the two cable-news networks that covers him skeptically. And the nature of his temperament is that when he scouts a weakness, he keeps striking at it. If Trump gets his way with CBS and CNN, he will turn to fresh targets, until everyone in the kingdom submits.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","There Were Two Charlie Kirks","https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2025/12/why-charlie-kirk-loved-jewish-sabbath/685374/","Mon, 22 Dec 2025 12:30:00 GMT","

A new book by the right-wing activist, who was murdered in September, has moments of seriousness, beauty, and cross-partisan appeal.

Charlie Kirk's last book, Stop, in the Name of God, was released on the morning of December 9. By afternoon, it had jumped to No. 1 on Amazon and then sold out. On one hand, this should surprise no one. Kirk had a huge following even before his assassination made him, for many, a martyred saint and drove an online surge of both mourning and recrimination over insufficient mourning. On the other hand, this is a book about the Sabbath. Living authors of books investigating the day of rest, a small but select sodality, are probably feeling dizzy right now. I know I am. (Kirk seems to have read my book, The Sabbath World, and mentions me once.) The Sabbath is generally regarded as a topic of specialized interest. I can't think of any other work of Sabbatarian theology that has attained instant best-seller status.

I should probably define my terms. Sabbatarianism is the doctrine of the Sabbath—the day of the week when, according to the Bible, humankind is commanded to rest, meaning, mostly, not to work. “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy,” says the Fourth Commandment. Kirk began keeping the Sabbath in 2021. His reasons, he explains in the book, had partly to do with mental hygiene and partly to do with God.

Kirk obviously didn't mean for a book about the Sabbath to comprise his last words. But his turn toward the Sabbath took him in an unexpected direction, and the book contains evidence of genuine spiritual struggle, which is the best testament a man of faith can leave. Americans knew Kirk as a political figure—the right-wing prodigy who had co-founded the conservative youth group Turning Point USA at the age of 18 and was a close adviser to President Donald Trump. But he was moving closer to Christianity when he died. Not that he wasn't plenty Christian already: Growing up, he went to church, attended a Christian academy, and accepted Jesus as his personal savior in the fifth grade. But Kirk renewed his spiritual journey in 2019 when he gave a sermon at an evangelical church at the pastor's request. When that pastor—who became Kirk's pastor—and others resisted church lockdowns during the coronavirus pandemic, Kirk mobilized them for political action. TPUSA already had a spin-off, the political-advocacy group Turning Point Action; in 2021, Kirk created TPUSA Faith, which is meant to “unite the Church around primary doctrine and eliminate wokeism from the American pulpit,” in the words of its website.

All of this additional activity took a toll on Kirk. As he recalls in the book, he was supervising 300 employees and had to meet a fundraising goal of $50 million a year, even as he was spending three hours a day on his radio program, The Charlie Kirk Show. Pretty soon he was “fatigued, tired, and spiritually confused.” A pastor advised him to start keeping the Sabbath. Kirk had some idea of what that entailed because a close friend and mentor, Dennis Prager, who was raised an Orthodox Jew, often talked about Shabbat, the Jewish Sabbath, on his show—Kirk remembers him calling it “the best part of his week.” Kirk had “Shabbat envy,” he writes, but he doubted that he could solve the problem of having too much to do by doing nothing one day a week. Eventually, though, he gave it a try. He turned off his phone and kept it off from Friday night to Saturday night, putting himself out of range of the daily barrage of work messages.

Americans, religious or not, kept the Sabbath for centuries. Blue laws, or Sunday-closing mandates that decreed a 24-hour pause from most work and commerce, were a legacy of the Puritans, who believed in keeping the Sabbath as stringently as possible. Over the past century or so, however, Sunday has come to mean mainly football and kids' soccer and shopping, and the faithful adding church into the mix. A small minority, including the Amish, keep an old-fashioned Sabbath, putting all work on pause. Others, mainly observant Jews and members of Seventh-Day churches, such as the Adventists, do too, albeit on Saturday.

“The first Saturday was extremely challenging,” Kirk writes, adding a bit later, “What if President Trump calls me and my phone is off?” But before long, he found relief and spiritual reorientation. He was giving up control, and that was a blessing: “The Sabbath calls you to lay down your illusion of self-sufficiency and remember that your life is not your own—it is a gift.”

For the work of a nonhistorian, Stop, in the Name of God is a serious book. I must admit I hadn't expected that, for two reasons. First, as Kirk says, he was a very busy man. (No writing partner is credited in the book.) Second, he was becoming a popular evangelist, a 21st-century Billy Graham, and I came to his book expecting a conversion narrative and some avuncular advice. Kirk gives advice, but it is not avuncular, and the conversion narrative takes up only three pages. The bulk of his book is apologetics in the classical sense: It mounts a theological argument in defense of a religious doctrine. Kirk does not talk down to the reader, and that is a feat.

The Sabbath goes back thousands of years and is a cornerstone of Western civilization. The rhythm in which six days of work were followed by one day of rest produced basic units of time such as the seven-day week and, ultimately, the weekend, along with foundational principles such as universal equality. After all, when the Bible declares that everyone has a right not to work, it is contending that all human beings have worth beyond their social status and productive function. That was a radical claim to make in an ancient world built on slave labor. In short, as soon you start talking about the Sabbath, you find yourself wrestling with big concepts.

Kirk has two main theses in his book,  and expresses each in a very different tone. One celebrates the beauty and moral uplift of the Sabbath; the other denounces the immorality of the godless in the fiery manner of a tent-revival preacher. The inspirational Kirk dwells lovingly on God's rest at the end of Creation and compares the Sabbath to a “cathedral in time,” echoing the rabbi and philosopher Abraham Joshua Heschel's famous description of the Sabbath as “a palace in time.” (Kirk quotes Heschel often.) The Sabbath provides what Kirk calls “the moral architecture of a free society.” It has a countercultural force. Keeping it “is a spiritual act of civil disobedience—an embodied rejection of any system that commodifies the human being.”

Kirk's skepticism of the marketization of every aspect of life will probably have a broad appeal. But much more often, we hear from the divisive Kirk. This Kirk thunders against the false gods of modernity and cites the Bible to support his hard-right critique of liberalism. Among the supposedly idolatrous cults of our time are atheism, anti-racism (“societal deconstruction, not personal redemption”), climate-change activism (“a millenarian movement, complete with saints” such as Greta Thunberg), and the credulous worship of science: “What motivates someone to bend the knee at the altar of their ninth booster shot?” The link between Kirk's Sabbath experience and his attacks on his bêtes noires, he says, is humility: The Sabbath demands it, and he thinks that liberals lack it. They believe that they can remake God's world in their own image.

Read: What Charlie Kirk told me about his legacy

Kirk isn't particularly humble himself. Perhaps speaking in the harsh style of the prophets gave him an unearned moral certitude. He doesn't make reasoned arguments to justify equating heathens and leftish social movements; he just throws around pagan metaphors. Nor does he try very hard to understand activists' worldviews before condemning them, which would have been the intellectually honest move.

The point that I suspect will really resonate with readers, though, is also the most nonpartisan. If one sentiment unites the left and right in the United States today, it is that technology exercises a tyrannical control over our habits of mind. You don't have to be religious to understand the discomfort—or allure—of spending a day a week without a cellphone. This is why a secular “tech sabbath” has gained cultural currency over the past decade. The Sabbath can promote physical as well as spiritual healing, Kirk says. It can interrupt the cycle of social-media addiction, in which dopamine highs meant to keep us scrolling are followed by lows, making us anxious or depressed. “The Sabbath is a living dopamine fast,” he writes.

The day of rest Kirk proposes is optional. One reason Americans took such a dislike to the day in the past is that they had no choice but to keep it. But I suspect Kirk had another motive for insisting on a voluntary Sabbath, rather than one mandated by law: He didn't want to be perceived as advocating a Jewish practice. I am not accusing him of having been anti-Semitic. A core tenet of Christian theology holds that Jesus liberated Christians from Mosaic law, superseding its picayune rules; in traditional Christian-supremacist terms, the new faith represented the fulfillment of Judaism, the mother religion. The doctrine is actually called “supersessionism.” In the Gospels, Jesus faults the Pharisees for insisting on a legalistic Sabbath. Yet the Sabbath “is not legalism—it is liberation,” writes Kirk.

From the beginning, Christians have argued about whether they were required to keep the Sabbath. Early Christians moved the rest day to Sunday and renamed it the Lord's day. From the second century on, Christian leaders castigated those who clung stubbornly to a Saturday Sabbath, saying they “sabbatized” and “Judaized.” Kirk goes into all of this, and yet at the same time he skirts the darker side of the debate—its vitriolic language, its punitiveness.  John Calvin, for example, railed against “the gross and carnal superstition of sabbatism.” And Martin Luther himself mocked Christian Sabbath observers, recommending that they also practice circumcision, since they were already behaving like Jews.

Kirk was clearly aware that he could be accused of “sabbatizing” himself. Yet he never fully explains his decision to keep the Sabbath on Saturday. He does not appear to have belonged to one of the Saturday Sabbath churches or had any Christian Sabbath community at all. He mostly defends his choice of day on the grounds that he loves the Jewish Sabbath—the lighting of the candles on Friday night, the songs welcoming the Sabbath bride, the lingering festive meal.

Read: End the phone-based childhood now

After this book came out, I began watching Kirk's videos, and I found two Kirks in them, too. One scathingly ridiculed his political enemies. The other showed genuine warmth, even sweetness, when he talked about his wife and family and faith and, yes, the Sabbath. I'd like to think that the latter is the Kirk who dedicated his book to Dennis Prager, whose “life's work brought me to honoring the Sabbath.” Maybe this is just me indulging in Jewish fantasies, but I imagine that Kirk declined to dispel the ambiguities surrounding his Saturday observance because he couldn't. He understood that the aversion to the Jewish Sabbath is part of a larger Christian unease about Judaism itself, and he was loath to get caught up in it.

Do I think that Kirk wished he were Jewish? Definitely not. Could the fact that he essentially Judaized refute Candace Owens's assertion that he was about to withdraw his support of Israel—which she went on to imply had abetted his murder? No again. Owens's conspiracy theories are despicable, but Kirk's affection for the Jewish Sabbath does not, by itself, prove anything: Lots of Christians have loved Judaism and disliked Jews; philo-Semitism is no safeguard against anti-Semitism.

Rightly or wrongly, though, I picture that kind of anti-Semite as unable to acknowledge that they don't have all the answers. Kirk does acknowledge it. He can seem too sure of himself in this book, but sometimes a less cocky Kirk emerges. “So here I am—still a bit raw. Still tender about it,” he writes in one of the few passages that directly address his Saturday observance. “I honor Saturday as my day of rest, not because I believe it earns me righteousness, but because it reminds me that I'm not God.” We will never know what a lifetime of being reminded on a weekly basis that he is not God would have done for Kirk. This small, diffident moment is one more reason to mourn his death.

The emerging technology is warping the record industry in all sorts of strange—and foreboding—ways.

Human beings may have sang before they spoke. Scientists from Charles Darwin onward have speculated that, for our early ancestors, music predated—and possibly formed the basis of—language. The “singing Neanderthals” theory is a reminder that humming and drumming are fundamental aspects of being human. Even babies have some musical instinct, as anyone who's watched a toddler try to bang their tray to a beat knows.

This ought to be kept in mind when evaluating the rhetoric surrounding the topic of music made by artificial intelligence. This year, the technology created songs that amassed millions of listens and inspired major-label deals. The pro and anti sides have generally coalesced around two different arguments: one saying AI will leach humanity out of music (which is bad), and the other saying it will further democratize the art form (which is good). The truth is that AI is already doing something stranger. It's opening a Pandora's box that will test what we, as a society, really want from music.

The case against AI music feels, to many, intuitive. The model for the most popular platform, Suno, is trained on a huge body of historical recordings, from which it synthesizes plausible renditions of any genre or style the user asks for. This makes it, debatably, a plagiarism machine (though, as the company argued in its response to copyright-infringement lawsuits from major labels last year, “The outputs generated by Suno are new sounds”). The technology also seems to devalue the hard work, skill, and knowledge that flesh-and-blood musicians take pride in—and threaten the livelihoods of those musicians. Another problem: AI music tends to be, and I don't know how else to put this, creepy. When I hear a voice from nowhere reciting auto-generated lyrics about love, sadness, and partying all night, I often can't help but feel that life itself is being mocked.

Aversion to AI music is so widespread that corporate interests are now selling themselves as part of the resistance. iHeartRadio, the conglomerate that owns most of the commercial radio stations in the country as well as a popular podcast network, recently rolled out a new tagline: “Guaranteed Human.” Tom Poleman, its president, decreed that the company won't employ AI personalities or play songs that have purely synthetic lead vocals. Principles may underlie this decision, but so does marketing. Announcing the policy, Poleman cited research showing that although 70 percent of consumers “say they use AI as a tool,” 90 percent “want their media to be from real humans.”

The AI companies have been refining a counterargument: Their technology actually empowers humanity. In November, a Suno employee named Rosie Nguyen posted on X that when she was a little girl, in 2006, she aspired to be a singer, but her parents were too poor to pay for instruments, lessons, or studio time. “A dream I had became just a memory, until now,” she wrote. Suno, which can turn a lyric or hummed melody into a fully written song in an instant, was “enabling music creation for everyone,” including kids like her.

Paired with a screenshot of an article about the company raising $250 million in funding and being valued at $2.5 billion, Nguyen's story triggered outrage. Critics pointed out that she was young exactly at the time when free production software and distribution platforms enabled amateurs to make and distribute music in new ways. A generation of bedroom artists turned stars has shown that people with talent and determination will find a way to pursue their passions, whether or not their parents pay for music lessons. The eventual No. 1 hitmaker Steve Lacy recorded some early songs on his iPhone; Justin Bieber built an audience on YouTube.

But Nguyen wasn't totally wrong. AI does make the creation of professional-sounding recordings more accessible—including to people with no demonstrated musical skills. Take Xania Monet, an AI “singer” whose creator was reportedly offered a $3 million record contract after its songs found streaming success. Monet is the alias of Telisha “Nikki” Jones, a 31-year-old Mississippi entrepreneur who used Suno to convert autobiographical poetry into R&B. The creator of Bleeding Verse, an AI “band” that has drawn ire for outstreaming established emo-metal acts, told Consequence that he's a former concrete-company supervisor who came across Suno through a Facebook ad.

These examples raise all sorts of questions about what it really means to create music. If a human types a keyword that generates a song, how much credit should the human get? What if the human plays a guitar riff, asks the software to turn that riff into a song, and then keeps using Suno to tweak and retweak the output? Nguyen replied to her critics by saying that the “misconception here is that ‘there's no effort put in by a human,' when so many musicians I know using Suno are pouring hours and hours into music production and creation.”

In practice, however, AI is helping even established musicians work less, or at least to work faster. The Verge reported this month that the technology has become ubiquitous in the country-music world, where Nashville pros are using it to flesh out demos and write melodies. The producer Jacob Durrett said in that story that Suno affords him “a productivity boost more than a creative boost”; the publisher Eric Olson said that it allows him to spend more time with his kids. Similar practices are happening in other genres. The Recording Academy's CEO, Harvey Mason Jr., recently said many of the producers and songwriters he knows are using AI in some capacity.

While the technology quietly reshapes the industry, the first-order effect of AI's ease of use is simply the existence of more music—a lot more. Suno users generate 7 million new tracks a day, which every two weeks nets out to about as many songs as exist on Spotify. Most of those tracks are likely never heard by anyone. Still, the streaming service Deezer has disclosed that nearly a third of the music uploaded daily to its platform is AI-generated. Spotify has said that it will crack down on obvious slop and spam—but definitively detecting when AI has been used to make a song is hard, and only going to get harder.

I admit to feeling some sadistic curiosity about what a full fire hose of AI music, intersecting with streaming algorithms tuned to deliver to users exactly what they want to hear, might reveal about listening desires. Historically, popular art tends to progress by the logic of MAYA: “Most Advanced Yet Acceptable.” Hit songs are usually neither wholly original nor wholly derivative but rather some delectable combination of the two. At a glance, AI may seem incapable of newness because it's trained to replicate music's past; many of the breakout AI songs to date sound incredibly familiar. But other examples show that the technology can, perhaps accidentally, carve new pathways.

Those are not always good pathways—but they are ear-teasingly novel, the results of choices a person probably wouldn't or couldn't make on their own (again: creepy). In Bleeding Verse's viral track “Only When It's You,” the vocals have a scuzzy vibrato, almost like someone's blowing bubbles into the mic; the post-chorus jumps to a whistle tone that's less Mariah Carey and more steaming teapot. An even more harrowing example: Spalexma's “We Are Charlie Kirk,” which has been sarcastically memed into infinity. The nu-metal tribute to the late right-wing activist is deeply catchy and sickeningly soppy, like Creed but a lot worse. If a real person had attempted to record it, I'm convinced that he would have fainted from embarrassment. The song is an example of the entropic abominations that might catch on should AI music continue unimpeded, at scale: Spalexma, an entity whose authors aren't known, published about 280 songs in less than a year.

However, in a bit of a twist, the full slopocalypse may be held off for a bit. Recently, a number of lawsuits by major labels against AI companies have ended in settlements that dictate significant reforms. One service, Udio, is now obligated to become, according to Billboard, a “walled garden” whose contents cannot be widely distributed. A deal reached in November between Suno and Warner Music Group mandates that the platform retire its current model and replace it with one trained solely on licensed data. Users will be able to remix work from artists who have opted to participate in the system, and they will now need to pay a fee to download their creations.

These developments will not end AI music, but they may slightly rein in the creative and copyright free-for-all, at least temporarily. The music industry—for obvious reasons—wants to control AI tools, making it harder, or at least costlier, for amateurs to jump its gates. But the generative possibilities and consumer demand demonstrated in the brief history of AI music to date aren't going to be forgotten. A cultural countermovement that emphasizes flesh-and-blood talent and craft seems inevitable—but so is a future for recorded music that grows more crowded and chaotic with each day. In that way, too, AI music is accelerating something very human: competition.

After months of strikes, tankers are a new, and smarter, target.

to Donald Trump, Venezuela was first all about narcotics. Now it is all about narcotics, oil, and the theft of American assets.

In the past week, Trump has added to his pressure campaign on President Nicolás Maduro by targeting the economic lifeblood of the regime: oil exports. The U.S. has seized three oil tankers in 11 days after Trump said on Truth Social that the United States was imposing a “TOTAL AND COMPLETE BLOCKADE” of tankers carrying Venezuelan oil that are subject to U.S. sanctions. The president added that the U.S. would also seek compensation for American assets that the Venezuelan government has seized, an apparent reference to past bouts of oil-industry nationalization by Caracas.

The new focus on Venezuela's most abundant—and valuable—natural resource (the country has the largest estimated oil reserves in the world) was, in some ways, the clearest articulation yet of Trump's ultimate aim. And some viewed the mention of a blockade as tantamount to a declaration of war, given that a blockade is recognized by international law as a belligerent act.

But the response of many Venezuela experts we talked with, regardless of their political leanings, was: This is how the pressure campaign should have started all along.

“I'm surprised they didn't do it much sooner,” Juan Gonzalez, who served as a Latin America adviser at the National Security Council under President Joe Biden, told us. The administration's previous moves have been dramatic and controversial: sending an armada of 11 ships and roughly 15,000 troops to the Caribbean and launching a series of missile strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats that has killed more than 100 people. But neither action has directly threatened Maduro's ability to stay in power. Hitting the single biggest source of revenue that has propped up Maduro's government since 2013, in contrast, sets in motion a process that could undermine him. And providing a way for Maduro to appease the White House with compensation for past acts could bring him to the negotiating table.

“If the objective is to force Maduro to make really big concessions, this is a really smart move,” Gonzalez said.

Jason Marczak, a Latin America expert at the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank, told us the blockade could be what's needed to sever the “financial lifelines that keep Maduro in power.”

But the Maduro regime also has a long track record of dodging sanctions and withstanding economic hardship. This time could turn out to be no different. “Knocking out drug boats did not stop drug trafficking or hurt the regime,” Francisco Mora, the Obama administration's deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Western Hemisphere, told us. “I think the now so-called blockade and the increase to the cost to get oil out of Venezuela hurts the regime. But it is not clear how much of an impact it will have.”

Despite the president's bellicose rhetoric, this isn't really a blockade. (The U.S. last imposed an actual blockade—preventing all ships from entering or exiting a port—during World War II.) In effect, Trump ordered the U.S. government to strictly enforce anti-Venezuela sanctions, some of which have been on the books for a while and across presidential administrations. That gives the Coast Guard the green light to carry out seizure operations if and when it encounters a tanker under sanction.

Unlike the campaign of air strikes on boats—which many experts consider illegal—there's solid legal grounding for such seizures. But they're not without risk. Oil props up both the regime and the Venezuelan economy, so conditions in Venezuela could worsen, driving even more migrants from the country. Gonzalez said it's unlikely the U.S. can sustain an embargo for very long, “given the humanitarian and migration implications.” The administration appears to be gambling that it can get what it wants from Maduro before tipping his country into total chaos.

Maduro's government has called the U.S. behavior “theft” and “an act of international piracy,” and filed a complaint with the United Nations Security Council. Maduro also ordered the Venezuelan navy to escort tankers headed to Asia.

Trump, in his social-media post, threatened to keep up the pressure on Maduro's government “until such time as they return to the United States of America all of the Oil, Land, and other Assets that they previously stole from us.”

Trump appears to have been referring to a 2007 decision by Maduro's predecessor, the anti-imperialist Hugo Chávez, to nationalize various foreign-owned oil projects. The U.S. oil giants Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips were kicked out of the country after they refused to allow Venezuela's national oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, to acquire majority stakes in their Venezuelan operations. Venezuela at the time was the fourth-largest foreign petroleum supplier to the U.S.

 Venezuela had previously nationalized its oil industry in 1976, when then-President Carlos Andres Perez vowed to assert greater control over his country's resources, marking a significant shift in Venezuela's energy policy after decades of embracing foreign investment. Exxon, Gulf Oil, and Mobil were forced to give up majority stakes in their own projects at the time. Several U.S. oil companies resumed operations in Venezuela in the 1990s, after the country's economy began to tank and oil revenues were seen as key to revitalization. It remains unclear whether Trump's comments were intended to take those projects into account.

Chevron is the only U.S. oil firm now operating in Venezuela, through a joint venture with the country's national oil company. It does so on a restricted license, which was renewed by the Trump administration this year. The joint venture was previously structured so that Chevron sold the oil in the U.S. and then paid Venezuela half of the proceeds in cash. When Secretary of State Marco Rubio renegotiated Chevron's license renewal, he allowed the joint venture to continue provided that Chevron pays Venezuela in barrels of oil-–not cash-–for any Venezuelan oil sold in the U.S. The idea was to limit Maduro's ability to gain from Chevron's output.

Those barrels have to be sold on the black market for Maduro to profit, Francisco Monaldi, an expert in Latin American energy policy at Rice University, told us. The only way he's able to do that, Monaldi added, is if “he can get them to China”—something made difficult by the new blockade. About 80 percent of Venezuela's oil currently goes to China, at least 15 percent goes to the U.S. via Chevron's joint venture, and the remainder goes to Cuba, Monaldi said.

The Trump administration is also seeking to expand America's direct access to Venezuelan oil fields by reclaiming the nationalized oil projects of 2007. Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff, said Wednesday on X that Venezuela's oil industry had been built by “American sweat, ingenuity and toil,” and called Venezuela's nationalization a “tyrannical expropriation” that he claimed constituted the “largest recorded theft of American wealth and property.”

Conoco won an arbitration award of $8.75 billion over the 2007 expropriation of three of its Venezuelan oil projects, Monaldi noted. It was the largest amount awarded to a foreign firm after those nationalizations.

If Maduro leaves or is forced from power and there is a successful transition to a Washington-friendly new government, then the U.S. may be able to push for compensation, though how that would be calculated is unclear. Venezuela's opposition has a transition plan for revitalizing the country's devastated economy, which includes inviting U.S. and other foreign oil companies to help restore production, along with a return to some of the old projects that were nationalized. If Maduro stays in power, however, all bets are off.

It's hard to tell who owns or operates the dilapidated tankers that circumvent official tracking systems, known as the shadow fleets. Their total size is also unknown, though experts believe it has swelled since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, after U.S. and European sanctions forced Russia to go off-radar with its oil shipments, too. S&P Global this year released a report suggesting that shadow fleets grew by 45 percent, from about 420 to 940 ships, in the year ending in May, and that they now account for 17 percent of the global tanker fleet.

Tanker Trackers, an independent monitoring site, says that roughly 400 tankers have entered Venezuelan ports since 2019. Of those, 160 are sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against foreign entities. Some of those ships are “stateless”—they are not registered with any country under international law—making them relatively straightforward for the U.S. to seize. Others may be sanctioned, but still are registered to another country. If the U.S interdicts one of those without permission, it is technically attacking another nation's ship in what could be interpreted as an act of war.

The president did not say whether the U.S. would take possession of the ships it seizes or divert them, but so far, the U.S. has seized the tankers it has boarded. U.S. Southern Command, which is responsible for U.S. military operations in the Caribbean Sea, referred questions to the White House, which didn't respond to a request for comment.

“The key will be in the execution. Do they stop every vessel and then inspect it for contraband cargo? Or do they only stop suspected ships?” Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and a retired Navy officer, told us. “The former would hinder all traffic in and out of Venezuela, a de facto blockade, which goes beyond what the administration said it was aiming to do.” But, he added, “if they do this selectively, it seems they are enforcing the sanctions put in place.”

Stopping oil tankers could cause severe economic damage to Venezuela but not lead to the fall of the regime, Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert at Recorded Future, a threat-assessment company, told us. If Venezuela can't sell oil, it will hurt the government's ability to import essential goods. “But that,” Ramsey said, “is not necessarily a death blow.”

White Crane, Kiara M, H Constance, Lattafa, Tamia, and Monique—these are the six additional tankers the Treasury Department sanctioned earlier this month, along with six shipping companies it said had transported Venezuelan crude oil in recent months. The U.S. has sanctions on hundreds of vessels it deems to be operating illegally as part of shadow fleets. This past January, the U.S. sanctioned 183 Russia-linked tankers, and in November, it sanctioned 170 tankers involved with Iran's oil trade. About 180 Venezuelan tankers are subject to U.S. sanctions, and roughly 30 of those had been in Venezuela this month.

The Department of Justice released dramatic footage recently of the latest vessel seizure. American forces, led by the Coast Guard and joined by Special Forces and Marines, rappelled from a military helicopter onto the Skipper, which had been sanctioned by the Treasury Department in 2022.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the oil on the Skipper would be seized by the U.S. once a legal process to approve possession of the vessel is completed. That process requires the U.S. to get a federal warrant, seize the vessel, and then ask a court to hand it over to U.S. jurisdiction. During Biden's presidency, the Justice Department followed a similar process to seize Maduro's Dassault Falcon 900EX aircraft in the Dominican Republic. The aircraft was then transferred to the Southern District of Florida at the request of the U.S. based on violations of U.S. export-control and sanctions laws.

“The downside is it's a very time-consuming, laborious, and onerous process, which is a problem if the government is trying to do it at scale, and not just a one-off,” says Martin De Luca, a former prosecutor and a partner at the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, who has long worked on Venezuela matters.

If U.S. authorities decide to seize a ship, they inform the crew by radio and board the vessel with troops, led by the Coast Guard. Once on board, the Coast Guardsmen will confirm that it is a sanctioned ship and divert the vessel to a port, likely in U.S. territory. That's if everything goes smoothly. Last year, two Navy SEALs died during a U.S. bid to board a ship off the coast of Somalia that was suspected of carrying weapons to Houthi rebels in Yemen.

The campaign against Venezuela is already incredibly unpopular with Trump's base—a CBS News/YouGov poll last month said 70 percent of respondents, including both Democrats and Republicans, would oppose military action. Any mishaps that produce American casualties could lead to all-out war, which would be politically perilous. Not all Republicans love that their party is threatening war to settle scores on behalf of Big Oil. GOP Representative Thomas Massie, in a post on X, said that “no one campaigned on using our soldiers to overthrow Venezuela to make these Oil Companies whole again.”

Your brain interprets reality for you. But how good of an interpreter is it?

Our brains have a way of playing tricks on us — like that ringing in our ears known as tinnitus. It's a sound in your head, created to make up for hearing loss. And that's not the only way minds create the world we live in.

“I study whether The Matrix is a movie or a documentary,” Pascal Wallisch, a professor of data science, neuroscience, and psychology at NYU, told Vox. Whether our senses are simply transmitting objective reality — or creating an artificial, subjective one.

“Everything that you perceive is filtered for your sensory organs and then goes for your brain,” Wallisch said. “ If we assume that you have a unique brain — which I do — then you are bringing a lot of yourself to what you experienced.”

What are other ways things aren't what they seem, and why do our brains function like this in the first place? We answered those questions on the latest episode of Explain It to Me, Vox's weekly call-in podcast.

Below is an excerpt of our conversation with Wallisch, edited for length and clarity.

You can listen to the full episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get podcasts. If you'd like to submit a question, send an email to askvox@vox.com or call 1-800-618-8545.

In the case of tinnitus, our brain creates a sound that's not actually there. Does our brain do this for the other senses as well?

In a nutshell, yes. For instance, neuropathic itch, where you think there's something itching you, but it's in your mind.

But I want to be very clear: It is very real in your mind, even though your mind generates it. I'm sure you have seen faces in clouds that were not there. This is actually very common. You're seeing meaning everywhere.

I've looked up at the clouds and seen things. That's my brain constructing my visual reality?

Yes. My biggest flex is that I figured out why some people see the dress, the infamous black and blue/white and gold dress that surfaced in February of 2015.

What did you see it as, white and gold or black and blue?

I saw black and blue, but my friends saw white and gold.

And are you more like a night owl or more like a morning person?

I have developed into a morning person.

But you historically are a night owl, yes?

Yes.

There you go. We had a study where we showed, yes, some people legitimately see as white and gold, some as black and blue.

It has to do with your assumptions about lighting. If you assume the dress was backlit or in a shadow or illuminated by white light, bright light, sunlight, it would be white and gold. If you assumed it was artificial light or inside, then you would see it as black and blue.And that perception depends on what you have seen more of: If [you're] a night owl, you've seen more artificial light.

Is there a hypothesis or a reasoning why our brains work this way, why they do this?

Your senses are not there for your viewing pleasure. They are there for survival. If you were sitting around until you had all of the information, until all the sensory information was unambiguous, some other animal would've already eaten your lunch or maybe eaten you. You're the offspring of survivors who, the moment they could make a call, made a call and acted on it. To be faster, you basically have to jump to conclusions. The conclusion can be wrong, but it's better than not acting.

I'll give you an example. Let's say you're in the forest and there is a tiger. You start getting a bad sense of it. Maybe you smelled something faint. Maybe you saw a little toe of a tiger somewhere, and then you bolted. You left. Your ancestors who were like, “I need more information. I want to see the full tiger before I make any moves,” well, they were eaten by a tiger. Because by the time you see the tiger, it's too late.

What's the cost of being wrong? Well, you get a little scared, but that's okay. We can live with that, literally.

What does all of this tell us about how reliable our senses are? Can we trust how we're interacting with the world?

Overall, they're very reliable. But you have to understand that they're reliable because of many redundant systems. I think the real lesson is we need to be more modest and more humble about how sure we are about what we think is true.

So are we living in the Matrix? 

In all likelihood? Yeah.

Wow. It's like we can trust our brains because they keep us safe, but everything may not always be what it appears.

Correct. Here's the reality. You and I and everybody else, we are sharing a low-dimensional — three-dimensional, maybe — embedding space, but there's a much deeper reality out there that our brains' senses can't see. There's no question about that. That doesn't mean it doesn't exist; it just means it's deeper than you think. We don't know what it is. It could be anything.

How do we keep living if there's this world that's right in front of us that we're not experiencing because this is what our brains are doing?

That's the whole point of why we have these senses is we have to pretend that this is it. We have to act as if, yes?

But this gives you, or at least me, a lot of comfort. This might not be all there is. There might be a deeper reality out there. So this might not be all there is, and that might be amazing and exciting.

Nike CEO Elliott Hill inherited an uphill battle when he took over at the sports giant in October 2024.

Since then, Hill has made changes — both big and small — to the company as part of its turnaround strategy. After retiring from Nike in 2020, the former president of consumer and marketplace returned to guide the company amid declining sales, sluggish growth, and increased pressure from upstart rivals.

During the quarter preceding Hill's start, Nike's revenue declined 10% year over year to $11.6 billion, following flat growth in the 2024 fiscal year. Nike shares jumped about 8% on the day Hill's appointment was announced in September.

The Nike veteran didn't waste time launching his strategy when he took the helm, reevaluating the existing practices and adjusting them as needed.

""We lost our obsession with sport,"" Hill said on a December 2024 earnings call. ""Moving forward, we will lead with sport and put the athlete at the center of every decision.""

Last week, during the company's most recent quarter, Hill told investors that the comeback ""won't be a straight line.""

Here's what Hill has been up to in 2025.

Nike's ""win now"" strategy — Hill described it on last week's earnings call as Nike's ""immediate response to our biggest challenges and opportunities"" — focuses on five key areas: culture, product, marketing, marketplace, and in-person presence.

The plan leans on a sports-driven reset that has ""realigned"" about 8,000 employees around its core sports categories, the company said. Those categories include running, basketball, football, and training, as well as sportswear.

The idea is to put the athlete ""at the center of everything that we do,"" Hill said in a March earnings call.

The running category is leading the effort and reflects the direction Hill is steering the company. Nike said its running business grew by more than 20% last quarter, which ended in November, marking the second consecutive period of comparable growth.

Hill shook up Nike's leadership this year.

In May, he restructured its consumer, product, and brand leadership to focus on three areas: consumer and sport, marketing, and product creation. As part of that overhaul, Nike's former president of consumer, product, and brand retired, and Hill promoted four other Nike insiders to senior roles reporting to him: president of Nike (Amy Montagne), chief innovation, design, and product officer (Phil McCartney), chief marketing officer (Nicole Graham), and chief growth initiatives officer (Tom Clarke).

Hill also hired a new communications chief this year, Michael Gonda.

And he made another round of changes in December, eliminating the roles of chief technology officer and chief commercial officer. At the same time, Nike established the role of chief operating officer, which reports to Hill. The new job's function is to ""integrate technology more seamlessly into our sport offense,"" Hill said in a note to employees that Nike released publicly. Venkatesh Alagirisamy, a 20-year veteran of Nike, transitioned into the role on December 8.

As part of the shake-up, general managers in all regions now report directly to Hill.

""It's clear how important it is to stay closely connected to what's happening on the ground, from intern to CEO, and every role I've held in between, I've felt that way,"" Hill said on last week's earnings call.

Hill said Nike's ties with wholesalers such as Foot Locker and Dick's Sporting Goods had frayed amid its aggressive shift toward direct-to-consumer sales.

Since Hill's return, he said he's been mending those relationships. For example, Nike is back on Amazon and has struck partnerships with smaller retailers, such as Urban Outfitters and Aritzia.

Nike's wholesale revenues increased 8% year over year to $7.5 billion during its most recent quarter, which ended November 30.

Hill said that Nike would strive to provide a more ""elevated"" experience for consumers, speaking in a January interview with Fortune. He said Nike had become ""too promotional"" on its own site.

""Being premium also means full price,"" Hill told Fortune. ""We'll focus on promotions during traditional retail moments, not at the consistent levels we are today.""

He said in March that Nike Digital, which includes its website and app, ran zero promotions in North America in January and February, down from over 30 during the same months in 2024. The cutback on promotions came alongside ""surgical"" price increases Nike made to mitigate tariffs in 2025.

Nike's 68,000-square-foot House of Innovation is the blueprint for its stores. It's a six-story flagship store that opened in 2018, showcasing the company's most advanced products. The first floor is dedicated to running, and the rest of the sprawling store is organized by sport, gender, and age.

Hill has frequently pointed to the revamped store in his first year as a model for Nike's move to sports-driven retail layouts.

""It's an immersive sport experience, and the refresh has already led to double-digit revenue increases,"" Hill told investors in September.

Nike declined to comment on this story.

Michael Burry says Nvidia is pushing the idea that building graphics chips that consume more and more power is the best path to advancing AI — and the result could be the US losing the AI race to China.

""Exactly and sadly,"" Burry wrote on X late Saturday, responding to another user's comment that called Nvidia the ""gangster of the AI neighborhood"" as it has ""shut down any narrative that even hints at reducing GPU demand.""

In another post over the weekend, Burry shared a chart showing China has more than double America's electric generation capacity, and is expanding its energy infrastructure at a much faster rate.

Nvidia has framed AI innovation as ""just figuring out how to power and to cool bigger, hotter silicon,"" Burry said. But China's huge lead in building out power sources means companies in the US are ""plowing capital into a race it is structurally positioned to lose.""

Burry said the US needs to shift its focus from developing more and more ""power hungry"" chips toward advancing ""AI-tuned ASICs"" — application-specific integrated circuits that are designed to do a particular task quickly and efficiently.

But he said Nvidia has a ""death grip on development"" thanks to its deals with many key players in the AI industry.

Nvidia did not immediately reply to a request for comment from Business Insider about Burry's posts.

Nvidia stock has surged more than 12-fold since the start of 2023, making it the world's most valuable public company, with a market capitalization of $4.4 trillion.

The chipmaker raked in about $148 billion of revenue and $77 billion of net income in the first nine months of this year. ""Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,"" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in the third-quarter earnings release.

Burry, whose contrarian bet against the US housing bubble was chronicled in the book and movie ""The Big Short,"" recently pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack.

He has made the case to his readers that Nvidia and other AI companies are inflating a historic tech bubble. He has said that Nvidia's customers have exaggerated the lifespan of its chips to drag out depreciation and boost short-term earnings.

Burry has also called out the ""give-and-take"" deals between Nvidia and chip buyers such as OpenAI and Oracle, and criticized Nvidia's stock-based compensation as excessive.

Nvidia previously responded to his critiques in a memo to Wall Street analysts that was quickly leaked. Burry fired back that the document featured ""one straw man after another"" and he stood by his analysis.

Replying to a subsequent comment on his Substack, Burry wrote that Nvidia had ""become too much of a focus."" While the company's response did make him ""think to look a little deeper,"" he said it was a ""relatively small short"" for him.

""I believe it will fall, and is a pure play on my overall thesis, but it is not the worst out there.""

When a power outage hit San Francisco on Saturday, local drivers had to navigate more than just darkened roads and inactive stoplights.

Footage shared on social media shows some Waymo robotaxis stalled in traffic, clogging roadways and causing disruptions. One video on X showed at least five Waymos crowding an intersection, forcing human drivers to maneuver around them.

The power outage in San Francisco has caused Waymo's self-driving cars to come to a halt, leading to traffic disruptions across the city. https://t.co/8vPCrKF9ze pic.twitter.com/kXjOJ3UN4c

Waymo suspended its ride-hailing services on Saturday in response to the power outage, which affected about 130,000 Pacific Gas & Electric customers.

On Sunday, a spokesperson for Waymo told Business Insider that the company had resumed its service in the area.

""Yesterday's power outage was a widespread event that caused gridlock across San Francisco, with non-functioning traffic signals and transit disruptions,"" the spokesperson said. ""While the failure of the utility infrastructure was significant, we are committed to ensuring our technology adjusts to traffic flow during such events.""

On X, Tesla CEO Elon Musk used the incident to promote his company's own robotaxis. ""Tesla Robotaxis were unaffected by the SF power outage,"" he wrote.

Tesla and Waymo are direct competitors in the autonomous ride-hailing market, but are relying on different technologies to get them there.

Tesla robotaxis use cameras and AI to find their way around. Waymo uses a suite of light sensors, radar, cameras, and detailed maps that are uploaded and regularly updated. That means sudden changes to the areas where a Waymo robotaxi operates could impact its ability to navigate.

Waymo, owned by Alphabet Inc., debuted its autonomous ride-hailing service to the public in 2018 in the Phoenix metro area.

The company has expanded its services to other cities, including Austin and Atlanta, through a partnership with Uber, but it hasn't all been smooth sailing.

In May, Waymo recalled the software for more than 1,200 cars after some collided with ""chains or gates."" More recently, a Waymo vehicle hit and killed a beloved bodega cat in San Francisco, sparking outrage from residents.

Business Insider Edition 

Ghana has deported 68 foreign nationals from the Ashanti Region following court rulings linked to organised crime, prostitution, and other offences, highlighting Nigeria as the most affected country in the latest enforcement action.


        Ghana has deported 68 foreign nationals from the Ashanti Region following court rulings linked to organised crime, prostitution, and other offences, reflecting the growing tension between border security and Africa's long-stated ambition of freer movement.
    


        The deportees include 42 Nigerians, 13 Cameroonians, seven Beninese, three Ivorians, and three Burkinabe nationals. The operation was carried out by the Ghana Immigration Service (GIS) after the conclusion of legal processes, according to Ashanti Regional Minister Frank Amoakohene.
    


        In a statement published on his Facebook page, Amoakohene praised the GIS for what he described as “professionalism, diligence, and firm commitment to enforcing our immigration laws,” while stressing that due process and human dignity were observed throughout the exercise. 



        He added that cooperation between immigration officers, the courts, and other security agencies was critical to maintaining public safety and protecting vulnerable persons in the region.
    


        While Ghanaian authorities did not provide a detailed breakdown of individual cases, officials confirmed that the deportations followed convictions and court orders related to Q-Net-linked fraud, prostitution rings, and other criminal activities.
    


        The Ashanti deportations reflect a broader African dilemma: the gap between aspirations for open borders and the realities of weak enforcement and rising transnational crime. 
    


        Although frameworks such as the African Continental Free Trade Area and the African Union's free movement protocols aim to ease cross-border mobility, many countries remain unable to fully implement them.
    


        Criminal networks, human trafficking rings, and migration-related fraud have increasingly exploited porous borders, making governments more cautious about liberal entry policies. As a result, security concerns often override integration goals.
    


        Libya offers a stark example. In recent months, authorities there have intensified mass deportations of undocumented migrants, many of whom are Africans using the country as a transit route to Europe. 
    


        These actions highlight how instability, limited regional coordination, and criminal exploitation of migration routes have pushed states toward restrictive, enforcement-heavy approaches.
    


        For countries like Ghana, the challenge lies in balancing regional solidarity with domestic security. While deportations are framed as lawful responses to criminality, they also expose how fragile border governance has become across the continent.

The world's largest technology companies are scrambling to manage a growing crisis affecting thousands of their employees on work visas, as new social media screening requirements trigger delays at US embassies and consulates worldwide.

Google, Apple, Microsoft, and ServiceNow have all sent advisories to visa-holding employees in recent days, warning them against international travel and describing appointment delays stretching up to a year.

The memos, sent by immigration law firms representing these companies or by their internal legal teams, paint a picture of mounting uncertainty for foreign workers who form a critical part of the tech industry's workforce.

The warnings come as American embassies have postponed routine visa stamping appointments, leaving some employees already abroad unable to return to work in the US for extended periods.

For H-1B holders, the primary work visa used by tech companies, the situation creates a particularly difficult bind. If their visa stamp expires and they travel abroad, they must obtain a new stamp at a consulate before re-entering the US. With appointments now being rescheduled months into the future, what would typically be a routine trip home has become a potential career disruption lasting up to a year.

On Friday, a spokesperson for the Department of State told Business Insider it was now conducting ""online presence reviews for applicants."" The department said it may move appointments as resources change, with applicants able to request expedited slots on a case-by-case basis.

""While in the past the emphasis may have been on processing cases quickly and reducing wait times, our embassies and consulates around the world, including in India, are now prioritizing thoroughly vetting each visa case above all else,"" the State Department spokesperson said.

A top sales executive at Dell has called employees back into the office five days a week … again.

""Effective immediately, all onsite-classified sales team members are expected to be in the RR, NV, and OKC offices five days a week for at least eight hours per day,"" Jackie Miller, Dell's vice president of North American commercial sales, said in an email sent to enterprise sales staff on November 5, which Business Insider has seen.

""RR, NV, and OKC"" refer to Dell's headquarters in Round Rock, Texas, and its offices in Nashville and Oklahoma City, which are sites with a concentration of sellers.

Miller's email came over a year after Dell first told its global sales teams to be ""on-site five days a week,"" in September 2024. A similar order followed for the rest of the company in January 2025 and took effect in March.

After ""recent site visits"" and ""end-of-day walkthroughs,"" leaders noted that the team was not adhering to the policy, Miller informed staff in the email.

""I want to reinforce our expectations regarding onsite office presence,"" she said. ""Maintaining a strong in-office presence is essential for fostering collaboration, communication, and productivity, and it is company policy.""

Employees should use personal business allowance or vacation hours for time spent away from the office, Miller said.

""Some leaders are reiterating their expectations of working a full day in the office,"" a Dell spokesperson told Business Insider. ""And as we have said, our team members are expected to work a regular working day in the office, but have flexibility as needed.""

""Also, team members in global roles may need to take late evening calls and can adjust their in-office hours accordingly,"" the spokesperson added.

Following in the footsteps of corporate giants like JPMorgan, Amazon, and Starbucks, more companies are steadily tightening work-from-home rules. But getting employees back on-site isn't as simple as sending a one-time memo.

Dell's RTO policy has not changed since it was first implemented, but there's been a disconnect between leaders and employees over whether coming to the office five days a week also requires spending eight hours there.

In June, 10 Dell employees across the US told Business Insider that the enforcement of the RTO policy depended on their manager. Some managers understood ""regular working day"" to mean eight hours a day, while others allowed their teams to badge in and leave soon after without repercussions.

""Expectations for our team members have not changed,"" Dell told Business Insider in June, adding that employees were ""expected to work a regular working day in the office, but have flexibility as needed"" for things like late evening calls on global teams. The policy does not state that eight hours is the requirement.

An internal FAQ obtained by Business Insider listed examples of when employees may be permitted to work from home, provided they have approval from a leader. These included a temporary medical condition, needing to provide care on a temporary basis, or adjusting in-office hours to avoid peak traffic.

""This does not apply to regular childcare, care for dependents, or attending to other personal business,"" the FAQ documents state.

Two sales team employees said that managers had not enforced the rule since the policy was first announced in September 2024. They requested to remain anonymous, as they are not permitted to speak publicly, but Business Insider has verified their employment.

""A lot of parents previously were told they can leave around 2 p.m. to pick up school-age kids and can finish the day at home,"" said one of the sales employees.

Miller's email meant having to ""rearrange the home life to accommodate, yet another, Dell change in policy,"" the person said.

Since November, sales leaders have clarified that there are no exemptions for children's school schedules, the two sales employees told Business Insider. They said the office is now fuller throughout the day.

In this article

The Trump administration on Monday halted Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, the largest project of its kind in the U.S., as well as four other projects off the East Coast in a devastating blow to the wind industry. 

Shares of Dominion Energy, the utility developing the project, dropped more than 5% on the news. 

The administration also paused leases for Vineyard Wind 1 off Massachusetts, Revolution Wind off Rhode Island, Sunrise Wind off Long Island and New England, and Empire Wind 1 south of Long Island. 

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said the administration paused leases for the projects due to national security concerns identified by the Pentagon. 

Shares of Denmark's Orsted, the developer of the Revolution and Sunrise projects, tumbled 11%. Norway's Equinor, the developer of Empire Wind 1, was down less than 1%. 

Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind is a 176 turbine project project that would provide enough power for more than 600,000 homes, according to Dominion. The project was expected to be complete next year. 

Dominion said the massive project is essential for U.S. national security and Virginia's dramatically growing energy needs. Northern Virginia is the largest hub for data centers in the world. Growing demand from artificial intelligence is contributing to higher electricity prices in the state. 

""Stopping CVOW for any length of time will threaten grid reliability for some of the nation's most important war fighting, AI, and civilian assets,"" Dominion said in a statement. 

""It will also lead to energy inflation and threaten thousands of jobs,"" the utility said.  

Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, supports the project. Incoming Gov. Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat, won the gubernatorial election in November on a promise to address rising electricity costs in part by expanding renewable energy. 

The Interior Department said in a statement that the pause will give the federal government time to ""work with leaseholders and state partners to assess the possibility of mitigating the national security risks posed by these projects."" 

Interior said the U.S. government found that turbine blades and ""highly reflective towers"" create radar interference risk. 

""The clutter caused by offshore wind projects obscures legitimate moving targets and generates false targets in the vicinity of the wind projects,"" Interior said. 

President Donald Trump has targeted the U.S. wind industry since his first day in office. Trump on Jan. 20 ordered a halt to all new leases and permits for onshore and offshore wind pending federal review. 

Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., condemned Trump's campaign against wind projects as ""irrational."" The senate minority leader said Interior's decision would spike energy bills.  

""Trump's obsession with killing offshore wind projects is unhinged, irrational, and unjustified,"" Schumer said in a statement Monday. ""At a time of soaring energy costs, this latest decision from DOI is a backwards step that will drive energy bills even higher."" 

Trump's campaign against the wind industry has run afoul of the courts. Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts ruled on Dec. 8 that Trump's order was ""arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law.""

Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said Monday he will summon the U.S. ambassador to Denmark for a conversation about President Donald Trump's appointment of a special envoy to Greenland.

""I'm deeply upset about the appointment and the statement, which I find completely unacceptable,"" Løkke Rasmussen told Danish media TV2 in an interview Monday morning. He added he hoped a meeting could take place today or tomorrow.

Since starting his second term as president, Trump has repeatedly said that the U.S. needs the resource-rich Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, for security reasons. He has refused to rule out the use of force.

Meanwhile, Greenland has shown little interest in becoming a top mining nation, and its leaders have criticized the U.S. administration's calls for the country to become a U.S. territory.

Late Sunday, Trump posted on social media that he had appointed Governor of Louisiana Jeff Landry, as the U.S. Special Envoy to Greenland.

""Jeff understands how essential Greenland is to our National Security, and will strongly advance our Country's Interests for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Allies, and indeed, the World,"" the president wrote.

The Danish foreign ministry declined to comment further and referred to Løkke Rasmussen's TV2 interview.

In an Instagram post translated by CNBC, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said: ""Greenland belongs to Greenlanders, and the U.S. should not take over Greenland.""

""No one should be allowed to change national borders by force. Neither politically nor militarily,"" Frederiksen wrote Monday, adding that she expected respect for the territorial integrity of Denmark.

In this article

Paramount Skydance on Monday guaranteed the backing of billionaire Larry Ellison in an amended offer for Warner Bros. Discovery — a clear response to questions raised by the WBD board of directors. 

""Larry Ellison has agreed to provide an irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion of the equity financing for the offer and any damages claims against Paramount,"" the company said in a news release. 

Paramount said Ellison, the father of Paramount CEO David Ellison, has also agreed not to revoke the Ellison family trust or adversely transfer its assets during a pending transaction. The guarantee does not replace committed funds from RedBird Capital and sovereign wealth funds, but constitutes a new layer of security for the commitments. 

Paramount Skydance is offering $30 per share, all cash, for Warner Bros. Discovery in a hostile attempt that's meant to rival an agreement with Netflix. 

Last week, Warner Bros. Discovery Chairman Samuel Di Piazza told CNBC's David Faber the board had concerns about the supposed backing of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison in the bid. 

""We were not confident that one of the richest people in the world would be there at closing,"" Di Piazza said at the time. ""Doing a deal is great; closing a deal is better.""

WBD earlier this month agreed to sell its studio and streaming assets to Netflix in a transaction valued at roughly $83 billion on an enterprise basis. Paramount wants to buy the entirety of WBD, including its portfolio of TV networks, and says its offer comes with an enterprise value of $108.4 billion.

Paramount notably did not increase its bid on Monday, reiterating that it believes the deal is superior, though Paramount did hike its proposed reverse breakup fee to match that of Netflix's offer. 

""What we've done in this amended filing is we've cleared the brush of obfuscation around the offer,"" said Gerry Cardinale, founder and managing partner of RedBird Capital Partners, on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Monday. 

RedBird is an investor in Paramount Skydance and has also committed to financing the proposed Paramount acquisition of WBD. 

Cardinale said Monday that as part of the amended filing Larry Ellison would back the bid through an irrevocable trust, which is anchored by 1.2 billion Oracle shares. 

""Like we've done through the six bids that we've made, we are being responsive to what their concerns are,"" Cardinale said.

Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery rose 3% in early trading Monday, while Paramount gained more than 7%. Netflix's stock was down nearly 1%. 

Paramount made three offers for WBD in the fall, which were all rejected by the company. WBD then launched a formal sale process that brought in offers from other bidders, including Netflix. 

Cardinale said Paramount's unsolicited offers likely spurred WBD to open up to a sale, putting Paramount ""a little bit on the back foot.""

During Monday's CNBC interview Cardinale, like Ellison on CNBC last week, appealed directly to WBD shareholders. 

""At the end of the day ... the shareholders own this company. The board doesn't own it. [CEO] David Zaslav doesn't own this company,"" said Cardinale. ""This should be a lot more simple than it is. It's very simple.""

Besides the question of value between the two bids, the question of regulatory approval has also been raised by Paramount as well as industry onlookers. 

""The Netflix deal kills competition,"" Cardinale said, adding that a combination of streaming platforms Netflix and HBO Max would create 420 million subscribers under one roof. ""No wonder the constituents in the ecosystem — talent, creators, theatrical exhibitors —  are losing their minds on this because they see the pricing power that they will create."" 

Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters have said they are confident their deal would pass regulatory muster. Sarandos has also issued reassurances about the future of the theatrical slate for WBD under Netflix's ownership. 

At a conference earlier in December, Sarandos argued the Netflix offer for WBD's assets would preserve jobs at a time of mounting layoffs across the industry.

Heavy rain and flash flooding soaked roads in northern California, leading to water rescues from vehicles and homes and at least one confirmed death, authorities said.

In Redding, police said they received numerous calls for stranded motorists on Sunday who tried to drive through flooded areas. One person in Redding died, Mayor Mike Littau posted online. He did not provide further information.

Redding has about 93,000 people and is about 160 miles (257 kilometers) north of Sacramento.

Between 3 and 6 inches (7.6 centimeters and 15.2 centimeters) had fallen by Sunday night in parts of two counties, the National Weather Service said.

In the mountain pass area of Donner Summit, firefighters in Truckee extended a ladder to stranded residents at a house along the South Yuba River, the fire department posted online Sunday. No injuries were reported.

The weather service office in Sacramento had said a series of warm atmospheric rivers would bring moderate to heavy rain to the Valley, foothills, and mountains the week of Christmas.

Atmospheric rivers are long, narrow bands of water vapor that form over an ocean and flow through the sky, transporting moisture from the tropics to northern latitudes.

Earlier this month, warm weather and air and unusual weather conditions tracing back as far as tropical cyclone flooding in Indonesia helped supercharge stubborn atmospheric rivers that drenched Washington state with nearly 5 trillion gallons (19 trillion liters) of rain in a week, threatening record flood levels, meteorologists said.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Technology stocks rebounded to end last week, helping assuage the latest worries about the artificial intelligence trade. The question now is if Santa is coming to town — which, in this case, means Wall Street.

Here's what to know:

The Justice Department released some of its investigative files tied to sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein on Friday. The release came on the deadline set by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, but it did not include all files as was instructed by the legislation.

The DOJ's website now has an ""Epstein Library"" with a search box for keywords in the newly released files. However, CNBC found the search box did not immediately work as intended.

A number of documents were reportedly removed from the Justice Department's site. A photo featuring President Donald Trump was later reposted after backlash.

Google hasn't been looking far to staff up its AI teams. CNBC's Jennifer Elias reported that about one-fifth of all AI software engineers hired by the tech giant this year were boomerangs, a term used for ex-employees who return.

That comes as 16-year Google veteran Josh Woodward has taken the helm of Gemini, the crown jewel of Alphabet's AI ambitions, this year. The 42-year-old Oklahoma native also kept his role managing Google Labs.

Alphabet also made the news this weekend for a different business: its driverless ride-hailing service Waymo. The company had temporarily suspended operations in the San Francisco Bay Area following power outages.

C-suite leaders are learning a lesson that their younger, rank-and-file staffers grew up knowing: There's a dark side to social media.

Executives and founders have been told that active social media usage is good for their personal brands and company awareness. But a growing body of anecdotes over recent years has shown that missteps can leave them — and sometimes the businesses they represent — in hot water.

Still, that doesn't mean there aren't benefits to being online, even if the reaction can be negative. How one founder put it to CNBC: ""As long as your name is in their mouth, you're doing something right.""

Make room, candy bars. Supplements may be making their way into stockings this year.

The wellness category is slated to gain ground this shopping season, with retailers giving this sector shelf space as consumers make resolutions for the new year. CNBC's Melissa Repko reported that brands like Grüns and Neom Wellbeing are aiming to win shoppers' interest this season by selling holiday-themed items.

On the other hand, Microsoft's Xbox may not be a hot item under trees as the gaming console remains in a slump. Between company layoffs, studio closures and price increases, CNBC's Jaures Yip found that some are wondering if the Xbox is finally dead.

Here's some of the events we're keeping an eye on this holiday-shortened week:

In this article

Google parent Alphabet on Monday announced it will acquire Intersect, a data center and energy infrastructure company, for $4.75 billion in cash in addition to the assumption of debt.

Alphabet said Intersect's operations will remain independent, but that the acquisition will help bring more data center and generation capacity online faster. 

In recent years, Google has been embroiled in a fierce competition with artificial intelligence rivals, namely OpenAI, which kick-started the generative AI boom with the launch of its ChatGPT chatbot in 2022. OpenAI has made more than $1.4 trillion of infrastructure commitments to build out the data centers it needs to meet growing demand for its technology. 

With its acquisition of Intersect, Google is looking to keep up.

""Intersect will help us expand capacity, operate more nimbly in building new power generation in lockstep with new data center load, and reimagine energy solutions to drive US innovation and leadership,"" Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, said in a statement. 

Google already had a minority stake in Intersect from a funding round that was announced last December. In a release at the time, Intersect said its strategic partnership with Google and TPG Rise Climate aimed to develop gigawatts of data center capacity across the U.S., including a $20 billion investment in renewable power infrastructure by the end of the decade.

Alphabet said Monday that Intersect will work closely with Google's technical infrastructure team, including on the companies' co-located power site and data center in Haskell County, Texas. Google previously announced a $40 billion investment in Texas through 2027, which includes new data center campuses in the state's Haskell and Armstrong counties.

Intersect's operating and in-development assets in California and its existing operating assets in Texas are not part of the acquisition, Alphabet said. Intersect's existing investors including TPG Rise Climate, Climate Adaptive Infrastructure and Greenbelt Capital Partners will support those assets, and they will continue to operate as an independent company.

Alphabet's acquisition of Intersect is expected to close in the first half of 2026, but it is still subject to customary closing conditions.

China on Monday announced tariffs of up to 42.7% on dairy products from the European Union, following the results of an anti-subsidy investigation that began in August 2024. 

In a statement by the country's Ministry of Commerce, China said that EU subsidies for dairy products had caused ""substantial damage"" to China's domestic dairy industries. 

The tariffs are set to take effect on Dec. 23, the ministry said, and the rates would be determined by the amount of ""ad valorem subsidy rates"" from the country's Customs Tariff Commission.

The tariffs range from 21.9% to 42.7%, with companies ""who cooperated with the investigation"" subject to tariffs of 28.6%, and those that ""did not cooperate"" facing the top rate of 42.7%, according to a statement from a Commerce Ministry official.

Products that will be affected include fresh, processed and blue cheeses — such as the famous Roquefort blue cheese aged in the caves of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon, France — as well as some kinds of milk and cream. 

The latest tariffs mark an escalation in trade tensions between the regions, which flared up when Brussels slapped tariffs of up to 45% on electric vehicles imported from China in October last year.

Separately, the bloc in November challenged China's imposition of tariffs on imports of EU brandy at the World Trade Organisation, saying ""China's provisional measures on EU brandy are not in line with WTO rules.""

An EU spokesperson described the measures as ""unjustified and unwarranted"" on Monday, according to Reuters, and said the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, would be providing comments to the Chinese authorities.

The Commission was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC Monday. 

Last week, Beijing sharply cut its duties on pork imports and pig by-products from the European Union, with new tariff rates ranging from 4.9% to 19.8% on dozens of European pork exports.

It comes after the country in September imposed temporary anti-dumping tariffs of up to 62.4% in the form of cash deposits on pork imports from the EU.

— CNBC's Anniek Bao contributed to this report.

Correction: This article has been updated to reflect that China's tariffs will come into force on Dec. 23.

In this article

Instacart said Monday it will cease the use of artificial intelligence-driven pricing tests on its grocery delivery platform after the practice was scrutinized in a wide-ranging study and rebuked by lawmakers. 

The company said in a blog post that retailers will no longer be able to use its Eversight technology to run pricing experiments on its platform, effective immediately. 

""We understand that the tests we ran with a small number of retail partners that resulted in different prices for the same item at the same store missed the mark for some customers,"" the company wrote. ""At a time when families are working exceptionally hard to stretch every grocery dollar, those tests raised concerns, leaving some people questioning the prices they see on Instacart. That's not okay – especially for a company built on trust, transparency, and affordability.""

Instacart acquired Eversight for $59 million in 2022. Eversight's software allows retailers to carry out pricing tests to gauge shoppers' reactions to higher or lower prices on certain items. 

Instacart said at the time that the technology would help retailers improve sales and growth, while ""also surfacing the best deals for customers.""

Earlier this month, a study by Consumer Reports and other organizations found that Instacart's algorithmic pricing tools caused shoppers to pay different prices for identical items from the same store. 

The total cost for the same basket of goods at a single store varied by about 7%, which can result in more than $1,000 in extra annual costs for customers. Instacart responded by saying that retailers determine prices listed on the app.

The company also rejected characterizations of the technology as surveillance pricing or dynamic pricing, and said the tests were never based on personal, demographic or individual-level user data. 

Reuters reported last week that the Federal Trade Commission had sent a civil investigative demand to Instacart about its pricing practices. 

Separately, Instacart last week was ordered to pay $60 million in refunds to customers to settle claims raised by the FTC that it used deceptive tactics in its subscription sign-up, ""satisfaction guarantee"" advertising and other processes. 

Instacart denied any allegations of wrongdoing. The company said it answered questions from the FTC about its AI pricing tools as part of that settlement.

Lego is rebuilding how consumers engage with motorsport brick by brick.

In 2025, Lego kicked off a partnership with Formula 1 that brought officially licensed sets to global retail shelves and immersive experiences to races around the world. In the nearly year since launch, the collaboration has bolstered fan engagement for both brands, lead to promotional sales of Lego products and expanded the demographic reach for the toy company and the racing organization.

In August, Lego CEO Niels Christiansen touted the company's Formula 1 sets as one of the innovations that fueled record first-half revenue and operating profit. The company, which is privately held, reported a 12% year-over-year revenue bump to 34.6 billion Danish kroner, or $5.4 billion, for the first six months of 2025.

""It is a massively growing fan base,"" Julia Goldin, chief product and marketing officer at Lego, told CNBC. ""It is the biggest motorsport now in terms of its fandom. ... We felt that we could really tap into that and deliver something very unique.""

With Formula 1, Lego isn't just leveraging an existing fandom, it's expanding it, bringing underserved demographics into the world of racing and engaging new customers. 

""Lego has a great reputation for picking out the right trends to become a part of, and motorsports in recent years has been on a real upswing,"" said James Zahn, editor in chief of The Toy Book.

""F1, as we've seen, has just become a cultural juggernaut where it is attracting an audience that isn't your typical motorsports fan,"" he said. ""It seems to transcend ages and interests.""

ESPN, which broadcast the 2025 F1 season in the U.S., reported record viewership numbers for the races. The Disney-owned sports network saw an average of 1.3 million viewers across its stations and platforms through the majority of the racing calendar. That was up from a previous record of 1.21 million viewers set in 2022 and up from just 554,000 in 2018, the first year of ESPN's broadcasting deal with F1.

Next year, U.S. broadcasting rights move to Apple TV following the success of the Apple-distributed ""F1: The Movie,"" which hit cinemas in June.

In expanding its catalog of products — introducing meticulously designed F1 car brick sets, complete with team-accurate liveries — Lego has built gateways into the brand for newcomers. 

""At the heart of it was understanding our audience's passion points,"" Goldin said. ""When we choose to go into a partnership, could we see ourselves doing something unique that would offer real value ... we felt like we had a real opportunity to deliver experiences that they would really love.""

The F1 portfolio included products for Lego's Duplo line for preschool children, traditional sets for casual builders and Lego Technic sets for more advanced builders. 

Lego was also present at F1 races during the season, hosting in-person activations that included functional, life-size Formula 1 cars and even crafting trophies out of bricks for podium finishers of the British Grand Prix at Silverstone.

At the Las Vegas Grand Prix in November, the top three drivers were chauffeured to a media availability area following the race in a life-size pink Lego Cadillac, a nod to the Cadillac F1 team that's joining the grid in 2026. 

With the 2025 season wrapped, Lego is already building into next year. 

""Lego is one of our dream partners,"" said Susie Wolff, managing director of F1 Academy, an all-female racing league under the broader F1 umbrella. 

""When they joined Formula 1, I immediately reached out to Julia [Goldin], the [chief product and marketing officer], and said, 'Listen, could we explore doing something together with F1 Academy?'"" Wolff told CNBC. ""There's just so many synergies between what they're trying to do and what our main mission is.""

F1 Academy held its inaugural season in 2023. The division was established to address the lack of female drives in the F1 series and aims to develop young female drivers and prepare them for higher levels of competition.

""We're trying to break down the preconceptions of motorsport being a male-dominated environment,"" Wolff said, noting Lego has similarly made strides to promote inclusivity with its brick sets.

As part of the ongoing relationship between the two brands, Lego has signed on as a team sponsor for an F1 Academy car starting in 2026. Behind the wheel is Esmee Kosterman, a 20-year-old Dutch driver.

Lego's Goldin said while the F1 Academy partnership is an extension of the existing racing partnership, ""they're doing it in a unique way, because they are actually partnering up to support a life-size car and the driver."" 

""That's a very important element of bringing more attention and kind of underscoring the credibility and authenticity of women participating in motorsports and, importantly, for their parents to see the opportunity [and] potential for them to be engaged in the sport,"" Goldin said. 

Zahn of The Toy Book described the collaboration between Lego and Formula 1, particularly the F1 Academy, as a ""perfect partnership.""

""[The] Female motorsports fan has always been there, but they haven't necessarily been embraced on the consumer product side of things,"" he said.

Wolff and Goldin both noted that one of the fastest-growing segments of the Formula 1 fan base is women. 

""We are tapping exactly into the the trend of this fandom and we're adding value to the partner, as well,"" Goldin said. ""We see from our data that not only are we engaging more F1 fans with the Lego brand, but vice versa. There are more Lego brand fans that are now becoming fans of Formula 1.""

Chinese tech giant Baidu has announced plans to bring robotaxis to London starting next year through its partnerships with Lyft and Uber, as the UK emerges as a growing autonomous vehicle battleground.

The announced collaborations will bring Baidu's Apollo Go autonomous vehicles to the British capital through the Uber and Lyft platforms, the companies said on their respective social media accounts. 

Lyft's testing of Baidu's initial fleet of dozens of vehicles will begin in 2026, pending regulatory approval, ""with plans to scale to hundreds from there,"" Lyft CEO David Risher said in a post on social media platform X on Monday.

Meanwhile, Uber said that its first pilot is expected to start in the first half of 2026. ""We're excited to accelerate Britain's leadership in the future of mobility, bringing another safe and reliable travel option to Londoners next year,"" the company added.

The moves add to Baidu's growing global footprint, which it says includes 22 cities and more than 250,000 weekly trips, as it races against other Chinese players like WeRide and Western giants like Alphabet's Waymo. 

The UK, in particular, has seen a wave of interest from driverless taxi companies, following the government's announcement in June that it would accelerate its plans to allow autonomous vehicle tech on public roads. 

The government now aims to begin permitting robotaxis to operate in small-scale pilots starting in spring 2026, with Baidu likely aiming to be among the first. 

The city of London has also established a ""Vision Zero"" goal to eliminate all serious injuries and deaths in its transportation systems by 2041, with autonomous driving technology expected to play a large role. 

News of Baidu pilots comes as its competitor, Waymo, also looks to begin testing in London, with plans for a full-service launch in 2026. Waymo currently operates, is testing, or has plans to launch in at least 26 markets, including major cities like Tokyo and New York City.

Baidu, for its part, has been aggressively expanding globally, with testing rolling out in international markets like the United Arab Emirates and Switzerland.

Bitcoin traded near $88,800 on Monday as global markets leaned back into risk following record highs in gold and gains across Asian equities.

Ether climbed back above $3,000, while XRP, Solana and Dogecoin also edged higher after a volatile stretch that saw crypto prices swing sharply independent of stocks and commodities.

The steadier tone came as gold pushed to an all-time high above $4,380 an ounce, driven by growing bets that the Federal Reserve will deliver additional rate cuts in 2026. 

The metal is on track for its strongest annual performance since 1979, supported by central-bank buying and persistent inflows into gold-backed exchange-traded funds.

Asian stocks advanced alongside the move in precious metals. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose more than 1%, led by technology shares, after a rebound in U.S. equities late last week helped calm global markets. U.S. equity futures were also higher.

Japan remained in focus after the Bank of Japan's recent rate hike pushed government bond yields to multi-year highs. The yen strengthened after officials warned against excessive currency moves, while higher yields reinforced the shift away from years of ultra-loose policy.

Crypto followed the broader risk tone but remained fragile. Traders pointed to thin year-end liquidity and lingering leverage as factors keeping rallies in check.

Data from K33 Research shows long-term bitcoin holders are nearing the end of an extended selling phase, while institutional buyers have begun absorbing bitcoin faster than miners can produce it. Corporate treasuries and ETFs have increased purchases even after prices fell more than 30% from October highs.

Crypto continues to take cues from the macro backdrop — helped by rate-cut expectations and haven demand in gold, but restrained by the aftereffects of a deep fourth-quarter drawdown.

Bitcoin BTC$89,362.16 rose from $88,000 in Asian hours to above $90,000 in European afternoon hours on Monday, but reasons for caution linger as U.S. markets take the baton.

BTC has tended to find early support during Asia and Europe hours in recent weeks, only to fade once U.S. investors return to the market.

That dynamic has made the U.S. session a key test for whether rallies can stick. Previous pushes above major levels, including $90,000, have often reversed during New York hours as hedges are added and profits are taken — often leading to hundreds of millions in liquidations amid the see-saw trading.

Derivatives positioning shows risk building alongside the price. Bitcoin futures open interest rose steadily as BTC pushed higher on Monday, climbing toward $60 billion across major venues, according to CoinGlass data.

Binance, CME and Bybit all saw notable increases, suggesting fresh leverage entering the market rather than short covering alone.

That dynamic has become familiar in recent weeks of price strength just outside U.S. hours followed by heavier selling once American traders come online.

The concern now is not the breakout itself, but whether the rally is supported by spot demand or increasingly dependent on leveraged futures.

Open interest rising alongside price does not automatically signal trouble, but it does raise the stakes. If the move holds, leverage can amplify upside. If momentum stalls, crowded positioning leaves the market vulnerable to fast pullbacks as long positions unwind.

The risk for bulls is that a failure to hold $90,000 during U.S. hours could reinforce the market's recent pattern of lower highs and quick pullbacks.

A sustained move above the level, by contrast, would mark a break from the sell-the-open behavior that has defined much of December.

Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) are approaching key technical levels at the time of writing on Monday as the broader crypto market stabilizes. Market participants are closely watching whether BTC, ETH, and XRP can sustain breakouts and achieve decisive daily closes above nearby resistance levels, which could signal the start of a short-term recovery.

Bitcoin price was retested and found support at the 78.60% Fibonacci retracement level at $85,869 on Thursday, and it recovered 3.67% over the next three days. As of Monday, BTC is approaching the descending trendline (drawn by connecting multiple highs since October 6).

If BTC breaks above the declining trendline and closes above the $90,000, it could extend the recovery toward the next resistance at $94,253.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reads 45, pointing upward toward the neutral level of 50, indicating early signs of fading bearish momentum. For the bullish momentum to be sustained, the RSI must move above the neutral level. Moreover, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator showed a bullish crossover on Saturday, further supporting the recovery thesis. 

On the other hand, if BTC faces a correction, it could extend the decline toward the key support at $85,569.

Ethereum price was retested on Thursday and found support around the descending trendline, and it recovered nearly 6% over the next three days. As of Monday, ETH is approaching the daily resistance level at $3,017.

If ETH closes above $3,017 on a daily basis, it could extend the recovery toward the December 10 high at $3,447.

The RSI reads 47, pointing upward toward the neutral level of 50, indicating early signs of fading bearish momentum. For the bullish momentum to be sustained, the RSI must move above the neutral level. Moreover, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) lines are converging, and a flip to a bullish crossover would further support the bullish outlook.

On the other hand, if ETH is rejected, it could extend the decline toward the key support at $2,749.

XRP was retested and found support around the lower trendline boundary of a falling wedge pattern on Friday, and recovered slightly the next day. As of Monday, XRP is approaching the daily resistance at $1.96.

If XRP closes above the daily resistance at $1.96 on a daily basis, it could extend the recovery toward the 50-day EMA at $2.13.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 42 below its neutral level of 50, indicating bearish momentum. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is showing a bullish crossover on Monday, indicating early signs of bullish momentum. 

However, if XRP faces a correction, it could extend the decline toward Friday's low of $1.77.

The developer or creator of each cryptocurrency decides on the total number of tokens that can be minted or issued. Only a certain number of these assets can be minted by mining, staking or other mechanisms. This is defined by the algorithm of the underlying blockchain technology. On the other hand, circulating supply can also be decreased via actions such as burning tokens, or mistakenly sending assets to addresses of other incompatible blockchains.

Market capitalization is the result of multiplying the circulating supply of a certain asset by the asset's current market value. 

Trading volume refers to the total number of tokens for a specific asset that has been transacted or exchanged between buyers and sellers within set trading hours, for example, 24 hours. It is used to gauge market sentiment, this metric combines all volumes on centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges. Increasing trading volume often denotes the demand for a certain asset as more people are buying and selling the cryptocurrency.

Funding rates are a concept designed to encourage traders to take positions and ensure perpetual contract prices match spot markets. It defines a mechanism by exchanges to ensure that future prices and index prices periodic payments regularly converge. When the funding rate is positive, the price of the perpetual contract is higher than the mark price. This means traders who are bullish and have opened long positions pay traders who are in short positions. On the other hand, a negative funding rate means perpetual prices are below the mark price, and hence traders with short positions pay traders who have opened long positions.

Une erreur s'est produite

One of the five largest Ethereum treasury firms has sold a large portion of its ETH holdings. This has triggered fresh debate over whether institutional players are turning bearish on Ethereum — or simply managing balance-sheet risk.

ETHZilla disclosed that it sold 24,291 ETH for approximately $74.5 million as part of the early redemption of its senior secured convertible notes.

The company said it will use all, or a significant portion, of the proceeds to repay the outstanding debt, with redemptions scheduled before New Year's Eve.

In simple terms, ETHZilla sold Ether to pay back loans, not because it expects Ethereum's price to fall. Senior secured convertible notes rank high in repayment priority and often require cash settlement.

Selling liquid assets like ETH is a common way to close such obligations.

The company also announced it will discontinue its mNAV dashboard, which previously tracked its Ethereum holdings and net asset value.

ETHZilla said future valuation should focus on revenue and cash flow from its real-world asset (RWA) tokenization business, rather than its crypto treasury alone.

The move signals a strategic shift, not capitulation. ETHZilla is repositioning itself from a crypto-treasury-driven narrative toward an operating business model centered on RWA tokenization.

Ethereum remains part of its balance sheet, but no longer the core investment thesis.

From a market perspective, the sale represents mechanical, one-off sell pressure, tied to debt repayment. It does not reflect a broader institutional exit from Ethereum.

Regardless, the company's stock price has suffered significantly after today's announcement.

Ethereum has traded near the $3,000 level in recent sessions, rebounding from mid-December lows around $2,900 after weeks of sideways and choppy action.

Broader risk-asset uncertainty, thin year-end liquidity, and mixed institutional flows have kept ETH range-bound.

Against that backdrop, isolated treasury sales tend to have limited lasting impact, unless they reflect a wider trend — which, so far, they do not.

Other high-profile moves reinforce that institutional behavior around Ethereum remains mixed rather than one-sided.

Earlier this month, on-chain data showed Arthur Hayes moving several million dollars' worth of ETH to institutional and centralized venues.

While widely interpreted as selling, Hayes has publicly framed the activity as portfolio rotation into selective DeFi positions, not an exit from Ethereum.

By contrast, BitMine Immersion Technologies, associated with Tom Lee, has continued to accumulate ETH aggressively throughout December.

BitMine's latest reported purchase occurred on December 22, adding to a growing treasury built during market pullbacks.

Overall, ETHZilla's sale was driven by debt obligations and corporate restructuring, not a bearish Ethereum outlook.

Recent activity across treasury firms shows a market defined by rebalancing, selective accumulation, and balance-sheet discipline, rather than wholesale institutional selling.

It's the digital asset treasury bubble in reverse as companies once hellbent on accumulating crypto on their balance sheets turn to digital asset sales in an effort to either prop plunging stock prices or reduce outstanding debt.

ETHZilla (ETHZ), a Nasdaq-listed firm focused on building a reserve of the second-largest cryptocurrency, ether ETH$3,033.60, late Friday said it sold $74.5 million worth of tokens from its treasury. It's the company's second such sale of ETH holdings.

The funds from this latest sale are intended to redeem outstanding senior secured convertible notes under the terms of an agreement signed earlier this month, according to a Friday regulatory filing.

The company sold 24,291 ETH at an average price of $3,068, bringing company holdings down to roughly 69,800 ETH worth more than $200 million.

ETHZ shares were lower by 4% on Monday, and have lost roughly 96% from their August highs.

The latest maneuver underscores the ongoing pressure digital asset treasuries face. Many public firms that raised funds to buy digital assets earlier this year are now trading below the net asset value (NAV) of their holdings as their stock prices have slumped far more than the value of their underlying crypto.

That discount has made it harder, if not impossible, to raise capital to accumulate additional crypto assets, leading some firms to shift to managing liabilities by instead dipping into their crypto reserves.

ETHZilla earlier in the fourth quarter unloaded $40 million in ETH , using proceeds then to fund share repurchases. The stock, though has continued to fall, currently trading below $7 versus the $20 area when the October repurchase was announced.

The company said it may continue to raise capital through selling ETH or equity offerings as it works to advance its business plans.

Oops, something went wrong

An updated edition of the Nov. 4, 2025 article.Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, Dogecoin, XRP, stablecoins and other altcoins operate on blockchain networks, decentralized systems that use advanced cryptography to deliver secure, transparent and immutable recordkeeping. This tamper-resistant architecture continues to support growing adoption and investor confidence worldwide.Recently, digital assets have undergone sharp corrections and extended periods of sideways trading through November and December. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, has faced bearish sentiment amid a difficult macroeconomic backdrop and tighter liquidity conditions. During the past 12 months, Bitcoin traded between a low of $76,270.13 and a high of $124,714.85. Over the last seven days, Bitcoin has slipped 0.1%, while Ethereum and Solana have declined 3.7% and 4.7%, respectively.Nevertheless, long-term expectations remain bullish due to a favorable regulatory environment and growing institutional acceptance. The GENIUS Act, passed on July 17, establishes a legislative foundation for stablecoins, which benefits the likes of Circle Internet Group CRCL that offers USDC. On Dec. 18, SoFi Technologies SOFI launched SoFiUSD, a fully reserved U.S. dollar stablecoin that can be used by banks, fintechs and enterprise platforms. J.P. Morgan recently launched a tokenized money-market fund on Ethereum, while Italian bank UniCredit issued its first tokenized structured note on a public blockchain. U.S. policy direction under President Donald Trump has further supported the market. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Spring 2025 Regulatory Agenda introduces potential rules, including amendments to Exchange Act Rules to account for the trading of crypto assets on Alternative Trading Systems and national securities exchanges, as well as rules relating to the offer and sale of crypto assets. In September, the Nasdaq filed a Form 19b-4 with the SEC, proposing rule changes that would allow trading of equity securities and exchange-traded products (ETPs) in “tokenized form” (utilizing blockchain technology) on Nasdaq. These developments bode well for digital asset providers like Robinhood HOOD and Figure Technology Solutions FIGR.

In December 2025, HOOD agreed to acquire PT Buana Capital Sekuritas and PT Pedagang Aset Kripto, marking its entry into Indonesia and accelerating its APAC expansion plan. Figure Technology Solutions is attracting attention due to its launch of blockchain-native public equity security, which allows investors to hold, transfer and collateralize Figure stock directly on the Provenance blockchain. This allows investors to fast settle bilateral deals, 24/7 trading, cross-collateralization of the security to other assets and the ability to lend or borrow the stock transparently. Figure's blockchain-native structure eliminates a complex stack of intermediaries, including custodians and clearing firms, to prime brokers and introducing brokers. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company reported 70% jump in total consumer loan marketplace volume to $2.5 billion in the third quarter of 2025, driven by continued expansion across its origination partner network and increased utilization of Figure Connect for liquidity. Blockchain-based solutions for crypto-backed loans, loans to small and medium businesses and debt service covenant ratio loans contributed more than $80 million in volume in the reported quarter. At the end of the third quarter of 2025, Figure originated more than $18 billion in loans on the Provenance blockchain and executed over $60 billion in blockchain transactions. Growing adoption of the Figure Connect marketplace by partners to access the capital market has been a key catalyst for FIGR.Circle Internet Group offers USDC stablecoin, which is redeemable on a one-for-one basis for U.S. dollars and is backed by reserves consisting of highly liquid, price-stable cash and cash equivalents.

An expanding partner base, which includes the likes of Kraken, Binance, Corpay, FIS, Fiserv, OKX, Finastra and Fireblocks, is noteworthy. Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol has emerged as a trusted, efficient way to move digital dollars across blockchain networks, helping attract major partners like Visa, Deutsche Börse, Kraken, Finastra and global banks. Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of the Circle Payments Network (CPN) is opening new corridors for USDC payments. As CPN scales across multiple regions, the ease of using USDC for everyday financial flows is rising, reinforcing adoption and strengthening Circle's network effects. This accelerating adoption is translating into steady financial gains. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company's position remains encouraging as institutional demand climbs, regulatory clarity strengthens and CPN expands globally.

Datavault AI (NASDAQ: DVLT) announced on December 22, 2025 the issuance of two U.S. patents covering blockchain-based content licensing, smart-contract verification, and tokenized monetization for digital content and creative works.

The patents reinforce Datavault AI's Sumerian Crypto Anchors, DataScore, and DataValue AI agents and aim to enable tokenization of intellectual property and real-world assets with quantum-resistant encryption, supporting fractional ownership and instant settlement.


      
      
      Following this news, DVLT has declined 12.48%, reflecting a significant negative market reaction.
      
      
      
      Our momentum scanner has triggered 36 alerts so far, indicating elevated trading interest and price volatility.
      
      
      The stock is currently trading at $0.85.
      
      
      This price movement has removed approximately $67M from the company's valuation.
      
      
      Trading volume is very high at 3.5x the average, suggesting heavy selling pressure.
      
      
    


      Data tracked by StockTitan Argus (15 min delayed). Upgrade to Silver for real-time data.
    

DVLT showed a -9.24% move pre-news while peers were mixed: INTZ up 2.4%, VRAR, CSAI, USIO and AUID down between -1.72% and -5.87%, suggesting stock-specific dynamics rather than a unified sector trend.

Recent AI-tag announcements with broadly constructive business themes have all seen negative 24h price reactions, indicating a pattern of selling into news.

Over the past month, Datavault AI has issued multiple AI-related updates, including sports and NIL data monetization initiatives on Dec. 15, 2025, a Dream Bowl Meme Coin distribution timeline on Dec. 11, 2025, and a WBC licensing deal plus a large Scilex Bitcoin equity financing on Nov. 26, 2025. An exclusive smart-contract licensing deal with Wellgistics on Nov. 25, 2025 also expanded use of its patented tech. Despite these developments, each event's 24h move was negative, framing today's patent news against a backdrop of selling on prior AI-tag catalysts.

DVLT has an active Form S-3 filed on Oct. 17, 2025 registering up to 5,000,000 common shares for resale by existing holders. The company receives no proceeds from these sales but does highlight risks such as going concern language, near-term financing needs, potential dilution from future issuances, volatility, and a recent history of Nasdaq compliance issues.


    The stock is dropping -12.5% following this news. A negative reaction despite news of two foundational U.S. patents would fit the recent pattern of selling on AI-related announcements, where prior updates all saw negative 24h moves. Investors have also been digesting earlier equity financings and resale capacity under the S-3, which may weigh on sentiment even when IP expands. Such dynamics can lead to volatility as the market balances long-term platform potential against dilution and financing risks.

Strengthens Datavault AI's Leadership in AI-Powered Data Valuation and Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization Across Multi-Trillion Dollar Markets

PHILADELPHIA, Dec.  22, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via IBN -- Datavault AI Inc. (“Datavault AI” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: DVLT), a pioneer in AI-driven data valuation, monetization, and quantum-encrypted RWA tokenization, today announced the issuance of two key U.S. patents that significantly bolster its intellectual property portfolio in blockchain-based content management and monetization.

“The issuance of these patents represents a major milestone in our mission to empower creators and enterprises with trusted, scalable data and content monetization,” said Nathaniel T. Bradley, CEO of Datavault AI Inc. “In an era where digital content and data represent trillions in untapped value, our technologies provide the security, transparency, and automation needed to transform intellectual property into tokenized real-world assets. These patents strengthen our competitive moat and accelerate our leadership in the convergence of AI, blockchain, and RWA tokenization.”

“These patents create significant barriers to entry and robust intellectual property protections for Datavault AI, while also enabling new licensing opportunities. The continued issuance of these patents provides the foundational infrastructure for our Information Data Exchange and forthcoming Elements, NIL, and political exchanges—all built on our exclusive, quantum-secured platform,” stated Joshua Paugh, Chief Intellectual Property Officer of Datavault AI. “This includes quantum chains, quantum-grade encryption, and our unmatched command of AI combined with unprecedented blockchain technologies.”

Market Impact

The global data monetization market is projected to exceed $7 billion in 2025, growing rapidly toward $17 billion by 2033.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","Enjin Launches Essence of the Elements Multiverse Quest","https://egamers.io/enjin-launches-essence-of-the-elements-multiverse-quest/","Mon, 22 Dec 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Enjin is set to captivate the gaming community with its forthcoming Multiverse Quest, “Essence of the Elements,” slated to start on January 16, 2026. Following the success of its previous event “Search for the Shadowsong,” this new quest promises to provide an interconnected gaming experience that integrates NFTs across different games, wrapping up on December 18, 2026.

Structured around the four elements—Fire, Water, Wind, and Earth—each quarter of the quest introduces a new set of game environments and challenges. The adventure kicks off with the Fire Season. During each season, players engage in varied games within the Enjin Multiverse, earning ‘Essence' to mark their progress.

Participants are required to connect their gaming wallets to NFT.io and activate the Multiverse dashboard to begin their journey. This setup enables players to acquire and monitor Essence as they move through diverse gaming experiences, facilitated by Enjin's ecosystem.

At the heart of the quest are the Elemental Blobs—unique NFTs that players can accumulate and evolve. Each season introduces a differing Blob (Magma, Coral, Cloud, and Moss), which players can upgrade to Epic or Legendary statuses by collecting sufficient Essence. Over the course of the event, 200,000 ENJ will be allocated to reward achievements associated with these Blobs.

Additional seasonal rewards include exclusive Multiverse items like the Eternal Embers, Seafoam Amulet, Windstruck Tome, and Bedrock Helm. Moreover, players can win ultra-rare Degen NFTs which include significant staking pools.

Each season concludes with a draw, allowing players to win between 150 and 1,000 Multiverse items. The likelihood of winning these draws correlates with the quantity of Essence accumulated by players throughout each period. The draws are scheduled strategically throughout the year.

Initially, the Essence of the Elements quest will feature five participating games, which offer diverse means for players to collect Essence, whether through time spent playing or achieving specific in-game goals. To maintain fairness and consistency, the list of games will be locked once each season commences.

This holistic and structured approach ensures that “Essence of the Elements” is not only a fun and engaging gaming experience but also a rewarding one, leveraging the unique capabilities of blockchain and NFT technologies.

In the NFT marketplaces and decentralized crypto platforms, users usually need to grant permissions before they are allowed to trade, sell, or transfer any kind of assets. Two of the most discussed permission models are Approval for All in NFT marketplaces and Infinite Approvals in token-based DeFi applications. These permissions work on different asset types but have remarkably similar functionalities in that both permissions allow unlimited, open-ended access to a user's assets.

Anyone who is involved in the crypto ecosystem needs to understand why NFT marketplace ""approval for all"" permissions are actually infinite approvals. Such permissions directly relate to asset custody, transaction security, and user risk exposure. This article elaborates on the concept in great detail to aid readers in making a decision.

""Approval for All"" is a permission mechanism in the NFT standards ERC-721 and ERC-1155. By giving this permission, a user allows a marketplace smart contract to manage any NFTs of a specific collection that are stored within their wallet.

The main objective of Approval for All is not to approve every separate transaction of the NFT but instead to grant an allowance to the marketplace for:

Transfer NFTs on behalf of the user

Execute sales once a buyer is found

Manage listings without repeated confirmations

This permission remains valid until it is explicitly revoked by the user.

Infinite approvals are most associated with ERC-20 tokens used in DeFi protocols. When giving an approval, users often allow a smart contract to spend an unlimited amount of a token rather than approving a fixed quantity.

This approach enables:

Repeated transactions without re-approval

Automated Trading and Liquidity Operations

Lower gas fees and better user experience

Like Approval for All, unlimited approvals do not expire but remain valid unless revoked.

Although both permissions refer to different assets, the underpinning logic behind them is virtually the same.

Approval for All grants permission to control every NFT in a given collection, and Infinite Approvals allow unlimited token balance access. In both cases, permissions are granted over an intentionally wide scope.

Both approvals are one-time grants in nature and not events; once the grant is made, the smart contract will continue to operate without any further wallet confirmations being required.

Users rely on the fact that the deployed smart contract:

Free of possible vulnerabilities

Will not act maliciously

Will only carry out intended actions

Convenience and speed, therefore, are emphasized by these permissions, sometimes at the expense of reduced granular control over the assets.

In case the approved contract is compromised, an attacker can utilize that permission without having to get any other authorization.

When a user turns on Approval for All, this permission is recorded on-chain in the NFT contract. From that moment forward:

Programmatic transfers by the marketplace

Listings and sales execute automatically

There is no need for a wallet pop-up for every transaction

This operational model closely parallels how the Infinite Approvals work under token-based contracts.

Disadvantages

Availability of high-value resources

Higher stakes are involved if the contract is hacked

Users may forget active permissions

Limited visibility without tracking tools

Both Approval for All and Infinite Approvals introduce similar security concerns:

Smart contract exploits can abuse permissions

Phishing scams may trick users into approving malicious contracts

Marketplace shutdowns or rug pulls increase exposure

Long-standing approvals can go unnoticed

Because blockchain transactions are irreversible, misuse of these permissions can result in permanent asset loss.

Marketplaces adopt Approval for All to:

Improve transaction reliability

Increase liquidity and execution speed

Reduce failed trades

Provide a smoother user experience

While beneficial from a platform perspective, this model shifts more responsibility onto users.

To reduce risk, users should follow these best practices:

Regularly review active approvals

Revoke permissions for unused platforms

Avoid approving unknown or unverified marketplaces

Use a dedicated wallet for NFT trading

Understand the scope of each approval before signing

These precautions apply equally to Infinite Approvals across DeFi platforms.

Infinite Approvals are widely used across DeFi because they enable automation, reduce repetitive approvals, and support complex protocols. Approval for All in NFT marketplaces applies the same design principle to non-fungible assets, prioritizing efficiency over granular control.

Approval for All permissions in NFT marketplaces are similar to Infinite Approvals because both grant wide, persistent access to user assets in exchange for convenience and efficiency. While these mechanisms enable smoother transactions and better platform usability, they also introduce additional security responsibilities for users.

By understanding how these permissions work and actively managing approvals, users can participate in NFT marketplaces and crypto protocols more safely and confidently. Education remains the most effective tool for reducing risk in decentralized systems.

Approval for All is not inherently unsafe, but it increases risk if the approved contract is compromised.

A legitimate marketplace cannot arbitrarily steal NFTs, but vulnerabilities or malicious contracts can abuse granted permissions.

Users can revoke approvals through wallet interfaces or blockchain approval management tools.

No. Approval for All only grants permission; it does not execute a sale by itself.

Wallets warn users because unlimited permissions increase the potential impact of security breaches.

In a landmark moment for digital art, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York announced on December 20, 2025, the addition of eight CryptoPunks NFTs to its permanent collection. These pixelated avatars, housed in the museum's Media and Performance department - which specializes in technology-driven and experimental works - mark a profound institutional endorsement of blockchain-based art as a legitimate cultural artifact.

The acquired pieces include specific tokens: #74, #2786, #3407, #4018, #5160, #5616, #7178, and #7899. All were donated through a coordinated community effort, with contributions from Larva Labs founders Matt Hall and John Watkinson (who gifted #74 and #5160), as well as prominent collectors such as Mara and Erick Calderon (#2786), Rhydon and Caroline Lee (#3407), Ryan Zurrer of 1OF1 AG (#4018), judithESSS (#5616), the Tomaino Family (#7178), and the Cozomo de' Medici Collection (#7899).

Organizations like Art on Blockchain and 1OF1_art facilitated the process, highlighting the collaborative spirit of the NFT ecosystem.

This acquisition aligns with broader initiatives by the Infinite Node Foundation (NODE), a nonprofit that acquired the CryptoPunks intellectual property from Yuga Labs in May 2025.

NODE's mission focuses on preserving on-chain art and embedding it in major institutions worldwide, turning what began as a 2017 experimental project into preserved cultural heritage.

CryptoPunks, launched by Larva Labs as a collection of 10,000 unique 24x24 pixel avatars on Ethereum, predates the ERC-721 standard that formalized NFTs.

Initially free to claim for anyone with an Ethereum wallet, the project pioneered profile-picture (PFP) collections and ignited the 2021-2022 NFT boom, where similar series like Bored Ape Yacht Club built fervent communities.

Interestingly, MoMA's donation includes eight works from another generative pioneer: Chromie Squiggles from Art Blocks, further cementing early on-chain generative art in museum history.

As of late December 2025, the CryptoPunks floor price stands at approximately $76,000-$82,000 (around 20-27 ETH, fluctuating with Ethereum's value), reflecting sustained interest despite market cycles. This institutional validation could spur renewed collector enthusiasm and broader acceptance of NFTs beyond speculation.

MoMA's move - placing these digital natives alongside masters like Picasso and Warhol - signals a shift: blockchain provenance, generative algorithms, and community-driven value are now part of art history. The works are viewable on MoMA's website, ensuring accessibility beyond physical walls.

In an era where digital culture dominates, CryptoPunks' journey from crypto experiment to museum treasure underscores NFTs' enduring impact on creativity, ownership, and preservation.

In Brief:

Engines of Fury has embraced the holiday spirit by introducing a Christmas Event that converts its typical gameplay maps, Cliffside and Fairwater, into a winter wonderland filled with festive decorations. Since its launch last Wednesday after a short maintenance break, the event has seen active participation from the community. As players navigate through these maps, they can discover 16 different types of holiday-themed items. These items range from Bird Ornaments to the special Tree Topper. These decorations are integrated into the regular gameplay, adding a seasonal flair to the raids without altering the core game mechanics.

The event has sparked a competitive rush among players aiming to secure their places on the real-time updated Christmas leaderboard. Significant rewards await the top 15 players, pushing them to gather and safely extract as many decorations as possible. The top two players will receive a Rare Engine Core, which is essential for unlocking Faction Lockboxes within the game's Engine module. Those ranking between 3rd and 10th place will be rewarded with an Initiate's Pass, granting access to valuable Council Caches in future raids. Positions 11 to 15 will earn a Faction Lockbox and 200 Medusal Stems. This reward system encourages intense competition as there are no participation rewards.

The Christmas Event seamlessly integrates with the fundamental aspects of Engines of Fury, which is primarily an extraction RPG. Players are tasked with collecting loot while combating enemies and dodging other players. The added challenge of collecting festive items that need to be secured enhances the strategic depth of the game. Successfully extracting these items not only boosts the player's Christmas level but also provides them with valuable rewards that are pivotal for their progress in the game's economy.

This themed event coincides with ongoing game developments such as Initiates Season 2. By introducing fresh elements like Co-op and Scavenger modes, the event bolsters player engagement and enriches the gaming experience. As the event draws to a close on December 29, players are keen on making their final attempts to climb the leaderboard. The strategic integration of festive collectibles and rewarding outcomes exemplifies how seasonal activities can significantly enhance core gameplay, offering additional challenges and exciting rewards that resonate with the game's community.

When the Association of British Investigators (ABI) wanted to help members improve accountability and build trust with clients, it turned to Stephenson Harwood for support. We worked together on developing the UK's first-ever UK GDPR Code of Conduct for Investigative & Litigation Support Services - a landmark achievement that sets a new standard for professionalism and ethics in the industry. In October 2024, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) officially approved the Code, making it the first of its kind in the UK. This milestone demonstrates the sector's commitment to compliance with complex data protection laws and offers practical guidance for investigators navigating the challenges of handling personal data. “The Code gives private investigators clear rules to follow so they stay in line with GDPR,” said Tony Imossi, ABI's head of secretariat and a renowned international investigator. “Our aim was to establish a trust mark in data. Professional investigation is a sector that attracts scrutiny for how it handles personal data in providing its services. The Code guides investigators and agencies on how to carry out detailed investigations while protecting people's privacy and making sure data is used properly and legally.” The impact of the Code has been recognised beyond the investigative sector, with Tony Imossi shortlisted for the prestigious ‘Privacy Champion of the Year 2025' category at the PICCASO Awards. Katie Hewson, a partner and data privacy expert at Stephenson Harwood said: “It has been a great privilege to work with the Association of British Investigators on this very important project, which will play a significant role in setting a new standard for professionalism, ethics, and accountability in the professional investigators sector, as well as positioning the ABI as a model for self-regulation.” Founded in 1913, the ABI is the leading organisation in the UK's largely unregulated investigative industry. It boasts the largest directory of accredited professional investigators in the UK, with members around the world who meet the ABI's stringent membership criteria. The organisation takes a proactive role in promoting self-regulation and accountability among legitimate professional investigators.

The council is now supporting the idea of a version of the central bank digital currency (CBDC) that includes online and offline functionality, Reuters reported Friday (Dec. 19).

As the report noted, this diverges from past proposals by the European Parliament focused solely on offline usage. Under this new regime, the digital euro would be publicly issued by the European Central Bank and be available for users connected to the internet or offline.

Fernando Navarrete, the European Parliament pointperson for the digital euro, had lobbied for an offline-only version to uphold user privacy and the resilience of the coin itself.

Online transactions would involve immediate processing via the central bank's ledger or through permitted intermediaries, while offline transactions can be recorded locally and synchronized later with the central ledger once connectivity resumes, the report added. That means the system can be used even in places with poor connectivity while still offering users “cash-like privacy,” Reuters said.

The report goes on to say that the ECB hopes the digital euro can help modernize its payment system and keep central bank money relevant as the world becomes more digital.

As cash usage wanes, a CBDC would help maintain monetary sovereignty and trust in the currency, Reuters said. However, the project — which the EU is set to test in 2027 — has faced pushback from the banking industry.

Last month, the 14 banks behind the Euro-centric digital wallet Wero issued a statement warning that a digital euro could subvert private-sector payment systems.

“The current design of the retail digital euro largely addresses the same use cases as private solutions, without offering any clear added value for consumers,” the banks said.

Meanwhile, PYMNTS wrote earlier this year about the U.S. Federal Reserve's progress on developing a CDBC, arguing that compared to places like China and the EU, “the Fed's progress has been cautious, bordering on passive.”

The council is now supporting the idea of a version of the central bank digital currency (CBDC) that includes online and offline functionality, Reuters reported Friday (Dec. 19).

As the report noted, this diverges from past proposals by the European Parliament focused solely on offline usage. Under this new regime, the digital euro would be publicly issued by the European Central Bank and be available for users connected to the internet or offline.

Fernando Navarrete, the European Parliament pointperson for the digital euro, had lobbied for an offline-only version to uphold user privacy and the resilience of the coin itself.

Online transactions would involve immediate processing via the central bank's ledger or through permitted intermediaries, while offline transactions can be recorded locally and synchronized later with the central ledger once connectivity resumes, the report added. That means the system can be used even in places with poor connectivity while still offering users “cash-like privacy,” Reuters said.

The report goes on to say that the ECB hopes the digital euro can help modernize its payment system and keep central bank money relevant as the world becomes more digital.

As cash usage wanes, a CBDC would help maintain monetary sovereignty and trust in the currency, Reuters said. However, the project — which the EU is set to test in 2027 — has faced pushback from the banking industry.

Last month, the 14 banks behind the Euro-centric digital wallet Wero issued a statement warning that a digital euro could subvert private-sector payment systems.

“The current design of the retail digital euro largely addresses the same use cases as private solutions, without offering any clear added value for consumers,” the banks said.

Meanwhile, PYMNTS wrote earlier this year about the U.S. Federal Reserve's progress on developing a CDBC, arguing that compared to places like China and the EU, “the Fed's progress has been cautious, bordering on passive.”

The central bank has made no binding commitments to develop or pilot a retail CBDC. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has consistently said such a move would need clear support from the executive branch and congressional authorization. 

At the moment, the report added, “the political momentum favors stablecoins, not central banks.” A U.S. CBDC, PYMNTS wrote “would represent a public alternative to the privately issued stablecoin solutions promoted by the crypto industry.”

The NEOS Ethereum High Income ETF (NEHI) is fresh on the cryptocurrency ETF scene. However, this income-generating play on the second-largest digital currency may be relevant right out of the starting gates.

That might be hard to believe for some crypto investors who are once bitten and twice shy after a disappointing year in the cryptocurrency complex. After all, bitcoin — the largest digital currency — is on pace for just its fourth negative annual performance on record. A gloomy factoid to be sure, but it doesn't imply investors should abandon crypto.

In fact, NEHI could be an ETF to consider over the near-term because data indicate that following a rash of cryptocurrency liquidations starting in October that invited bearish traders into the market, short sellers have been covering positions. That could portend that short sellers see limited near-term profit opportunity with ethereum.

It's important to remember that the newly minted NEHI is a covered call strategy — an actively managed one at that — so it won't capture all of ether's upside should a new bull market come calling. However, NEOS's other established options-based ETFs have compelling track records of offering investors both some upside capture and high levels of income.

The ability to generate some upside is obviously noteworthy and pertinent because ether's technical condition could portend a rally is imminent, as the cryptocurrency has formed an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern.

“Similar ascending channels in Ethereum have historically provided support during midterm corrections. Traders typically watch for higher lows and volume patterns to confirm potential rebounds, though these signals are less reliable during periods of low network participation,” reported Brave New Coin.

Another factor that helped NEHI surprise to the upside in its infancy is an upcoming gas limit increase arriving after the January 7 hard fork. That increase will take the gas limit to 80 million units from 60 million, increasing the ethereum network's power while paring transaction costs.

“According to Christine Kim, VP of research at Galaxy Digital, developers are prepared to implement the change pending confirmation from the All Core Developers meeting. Barnabas Busa of the Ethereum Foundation noted that execution layer and consensus optimizations remain prerequisites,” added Brave New Coin.

As of December 17, NEHI had $8.6 million in assets under management. That's a solid start for a two-week old ETF, particularly against the backdrop of declining crypto sentiment among retail investors.

The conversation around digital currency used to circle mainly around tech circles and investment boards, yet the gaming world keeps pulling it into new territory. Players treat crypto less like a novelty now and more like an ordinary tool. The shift feels noticeable the moment you look across several gaming genres side by side.

iGaming platforms move faster. They embrace crypto payments because quick settlements and reduced friction suit the industry's pace. Some sites list Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a handful of popular tokens right next to classic options like debit cards or e-wallets. The numbers help explain it. Several operators report that crypto processing times sit under ten minutes on average for deposits, while withdrawals clear within a few hours, depending on the token and network traffic.

The speed of crypto is combined with an extensive library of games to form a competitive offer. iGaming sites can offer anything from classic casino games to Spribe's famous crash-style game. Gambling analyst Jovan Milenkovic offers Aviator insights about various online casino sites that successfully combine the features of both casino gameplay and crash games for a unique playing experience. 

Traditional action games sit far from the crypto spotlight, though certain studios quietly test blockchain elements in the background. Some adopt token-based reward systems that run parallel to in-game achievements. The idea sounds experimental, but players who like owning rare items without worrying about region locks find the approach refreshing. A few publishers also let users pay for expansions with stablecoins, and the popularity of crypto has even spread to a platform like Vanguard. Crypto transactions often settle within minutes. Fees fluctuate, yet typical network costs land below the rate some banks charge. 

RPG developers toy with crypto in a different way. They often lean into ownership. Players collect items, trade quest materials, or craft gear that carries sentimental value. Digital wallets give them a sense that these items sit in their hands rather than inside a server that might shut down.

A few mid-sized studios claim that over 20 percent of their active users engage with blockchain-backed items at least once each month. That participation rate surprises some analysts because RPGs thrive on narrative, like the recent title DeFi Cattos, not finance, yet players value long-term inventory management. When someone spends dozens of hours building a character, the idea of keeping certain rewards indefinitely feels practical.

Casual puzzle games step into crypto with a gentler touch. They occasionally accept crypto for ad-free upgrades or cosmetic perks, but they rarely anchor the experience around blockchain mechanics. Their audiences prefer simple loops, present in auto-battlers like Illuvium. Some studios report that crypto purchases account for around 3 to 7 percent of their total revenue. That may seem small, but in a genre defined by volume, the number sits high enough to matter.

These games rose sharply during the last bull cycle, then stabilized at a more realistic pace. Still, their user base stays incredibly crypto-aware. Daily transaction counts give a window into this space. Some networks hosting play-to-earn ecosystems process well over 500,000 microtransactions per day during active seasons.  That level of activity shows how deeply financial mechanics integrate into gameplay. Yet players who enjoy strategic markets appreciate the open pricing and transparent ledgers.

Josip Heit, Senior Strategy Advisor at Apertum Blockchain, has officially announced a strategic expansion initiative aimed at strengthening Apertum's position as a decentralized Layer-1 infrastructure built for accessibility, transparency, and long-term adoption. The announcement comes amid a broader shift in the blockchain industry, as major financial institutions transition from early skepticism to active participation in digital asset ecosystems.

Apertum, a Layer-1 blockchain utilizing Avalanche's subnet technology, has recently achieved a rare zero-vulnerability result in a comprehensive audit conducted by CertiK, a leading Web3 security firm. This finding places Apertum among a small percentage of blockchain networks globally recognized for strong technical and security standards.

“This expansion reflects a critical phase in blockchain industry evolution,” said Heit. “As the industry matures, Apertum's focus remains on building infrastructure that is secure, transparent, and accessible to real-world users — not just early adopters or institutions.”

From Technical Barriers to Inclusive Access

Heit's announcement traces the evolution of blockchain technology, contrasting the early days of Bitcoin and Ethereum with Apertum's mission to create a more inclusive and accessible blockchain ecosystem. Heit explained that both shared a key trait in their early days: they were designed for the few.

“Bitcoin in 2009 had no price, no exchanges, just a whitepaper, a few cypherpunks in forums, and a small group of early adopters running code on their laptops,” said Heit.“They were built by the technical, the nerds, the early adopters who knew where to find GitHub links and forum posts. They were not for your average person working a 9–10 hour day, supporting a family, or afraid of making mistakes with their savings.”

In contrast, Apertum's early phase has taken a different direction by focusing on accessibility rather than reserving the blockchain for elite miners. The team at Apertum asked, “What if the first years of a blockchain were designed to onboard everyday people, businesses, and communities through tools they can easily understand?” This approach ensures that blockchain technology is accessible to everyone, even those with zero technical knowledge.

Bridging Institutional Shifts and Public Adoption

Heit's announcement contextualizes Apertum's growth within a broader market narrative. Between 2017 and 2019, financial executives from major institutions publicly criticized cryptocurrencies. Statements such as “Bitcoin is a fraud” (JPMorgan), “rat poison squared” (Warren Buffett), and “money laundering” (BlackRock) reflected early resistance to digital assets. However, by 2025, the landscape had dramatically shifted. The same major firms are now leading the way in crypto adoption. BlackRock operates one of the world's most successful Bitcoin ETFs, while JPMorgan has integrated Bitcoin exposure into its client offerings, providing custody solutions.

“As we move from defamation to adoption, this shift marks the inevitable mainstreaming of crypto,” said Heit. “In 2017, institutions dismissed Bitcoin as a passing trend. In 2025, they are not only embracing it, they are offering it as a premium financial product. This is the pattern the crypto industry follows: defamation, quiet adoption, and full integration. Now, we are in the quiet adoption phase, it's still early.”

Security, Structure, and Strategic Milestones

In 2025, under Heit's strategic advisor, Apertum transitioned from concept to live ecosystem, integrating with partners, rolling out dApps, and growing a user base focused on organic growth and long-term sustainability. For less than a year from launch, Apertum has processed over 7 million transactions, supports 300,000+ unique wallet addresses, and is integrated with CoinMarketCap. Its native token, $APTM, is currently listed on major exchanges including MEXC, BingX, BitMart, and Poloniex.

Apertum combines over 15 years of crypto history, learning from past mistakes and refusing to repeat them. The project prioritizes accessibility over hardware dominance, focusing on a hybrid ecosystem where participation and rewards are driven by active contributions, not just technical resources. Its Proof-of-Transparency culture ensures full accountability, making every action verifiable on-chain, and fostering an environment where users, builders, and entrepreneurs can engage with trust and transparency.

The strategic expansion builds on a significant technical milestone. Apertum's recent audit by CertiK identified no vulnerabilities — a rare outcome among Layer-1 networks. This result reinforces the platform's architectural focus on decentralization and operational integrity.

“A secure foundation is essential,” Heit stated. “We've prioritized security and transparency from day one, and the audit results validate that approach.”

Strategic Roadmap for 2026 and Beyond

Looking ahead, Heit outlined Apertum's roadmap priorities:

Scaling Decentralized Ecosystem Infrastructure

Enhancing Stability and Growth of DeFi Products

Pioneering AI-Driven Blockchain Prediction Models

Expanding Global Market Footprint and Adoption

Strengthening Network Decentralization and Validator Involvement

Fostering Blockchain Innovation Built on Apertum

Apertum's development remains independent of venture capital or institutional funding, focusing solely on organic growth and DAO-led governance to maintain its decentralized and transparent approach.

“We're not chasing trends,” said Josip Heit. “We're building infrastructure that works — for users, developers, and businesses navigating the shift from traditional systems to decentralized frameworks.”

Imagine a world where the titans of technology and the pioneers of cryptocurrency join forces to redefine the future of finance and security. That world may be closer than you think. On December 22, 2025, Google Cloud, a powerhouse in the tech industry, finalized a staggering $10 billion acquisition of Palo Alto Networks, sending shockwaves through both tech and crypto markets. With Bitcoin trading at an impressive $89,279 and the total cryptocurrency market capitalization hitting $3.11 trillion, this deal isn't just a corporate maneuver—it's a potential game-changer. Why does this matter to you? Whether you're an investor, a tech enthusiast, or simply curious about the future of money, this move could signal a seismic shift toward blockchain adoption by institutional giants, potentially impacting your portfolio and the way we interact with digital assets. Let's dive into what this means for the markets, the technology, and your financial future. If you're ready to explore investment opportunities in this evolving landscape, start trading with cutting-edge platforms today.

The financial world is buzzing with the news of Google Cloud's $10 billion acquisition of Palo Alto Networks, a leader in cybersecurity solutions. Announced just a week ago on December 15, 2025, this strategic move has already propelled Alphabet Inc.'s stock (GOOGL) up by 5% as of December 18, according to data from Yahoo Finance. The ripple effects are being felt far beyond Silicon Valley, with the cryptocurrency market showing heightened activity and interest. Bitcoin, holding a dominant 57.41% of the market, and Ethereum, with an 11.76% share priced at $3,025.67, are at the forefront of investor attention, as reported by CoinGecko.

This acquisition isn't just about bolstering Google's cloud security offerings. It's a bold statement about the future of technology, where cybersecurity and blockchain solutions are increasingly intertwined. Analysts are speculating that Google's infrastructure could soon integrate blockchain protocols to enhance data security and transaction efficiency—potentially opening the door to mainstream adoption of decentralized technologies. Meanwhile, market sentiment, as measured by the Fear & Greed Index, sits at an “Extreme Fear” level of 25, per Alternative.me, suggesting caution among investors despite the excitement. Could this deal be the catalyst to shift that sentiment? Only time will tell, but the stakes are undeniably high.

For investors, Google Cloud's acquisition is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it signals a robust future for tech stocks, particularly Alphabet, as the company positions itself at the forefront of cybersecurity and, potentially, blockchain innovation. If you're holding GOOGL shares, the 5% uptick post-announcement is a welcome boost. But the real opportunity might lie in the crypto space. With institutional players like Google entering the blockchain arena, we could see increased capital inflows into cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which already dominate market cap charts.

However, caution is warranted. The Fear & Greed Index's “Extreme Fear” reading suggests that many investors are hesitant, likely due to broader macroeconomic concerns and regulatory uncertainties. If you're considering dipping your toes into crypto or tech investments, now might be the time to act—before the market fully prices in this development. Diversification remains key; balancing exposure to tech stocks with promising blockchain assets could mitigate risks while positioning you for potential gains. For those ready to seize the moment, open a trading account to explore opportunities in this dynamic landscape.

To fully grasp the significance of Google Cloud's $10 billion deal, we need to step back and examine the broader trends shaping both the tech and crypto industries. Over the past decade, technology giants have increasingly recognized the value of cybersecurity as data breaches and cyber threats become more sophisticated. Palo Alto Networks, with its cutting-edge solutions, represents a strategic asset for Google as it seeks to fortify its cloud services against these risks.

At the same time, blockchain technology has emerged as a transformative force, offering unparalleled security and transparency through its decentralized architecture. From Bitcoin's inception in 2009 to Ethereum's smart contract capabilities, the crypto space has evolved from a niche experiment to a $3.11 trillion market as of today, December 22, 2025. Yet, mainstream adoption has been slow, hindered by regulatory hurdles and skepticism from traditional institutions. Google's potential integration of blockchain into its infrastructure could bridge this gap, providing the credibility and scale needed to bring decentralized solutions to the masses.

Moreover, this acquisition comes at a time when the lines between tech and finance are blurring. Fintech innovations, powered by blockchain, are reshaping everything from payments to supply chain management. According to a report by CNBC, industry experts believe Google's move could accelerate the development of blockchain-based security solutions, creating a ripple effect across industries. This isn't just a corporate deal; it's a potential turning point for how technology and finance intersect in the 21st century.

Industry leaders and analysts are weighing in on what Google Cloud's acquisition could mean for the tech and crypto ecosystems. According to a recent CNBC report, some experts view this as a pivotal moment for blockchain adoption. “Google has the resources and reach to integrate blockchain in ways that smaller players can't,” noted a cybersecurity analyst quoted in the report. This sentiment is echoed by financial strategists who see Alphabet's move as a signal to other tech giants to explore decentralized technologies.

The potential industry impact is vast. For tech companies, this deal raises the bar for cybersecurity standards, pushing competitors to innovate or risk being left behind. For the crypto market, it could mean a surge in institutional interest—a key driver of past bull runs. Bloomberg reports suggest that if Google successfully incorporates blockchain into its cloud offerings, it could inspire similar moves by Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure, creating a domino effect of adoption. Real-world examples, like IBM's blockchain initiatives for supply chain transparency, show that such integrations are not only possible but also profitable. As this unfolds, investors looking to stay ahead of the curve can get started with innovative trading platforms to capitalize on emerging trends.

From a financial perspective, Google Cloud's acquisition of Palo Alto Networks is a masterstroke that could yield significant returns for Alphabet shareholders. The 5% stock price increase post-announcement, as reported by Yahoo Finance, is just the beginning. If Google successfully leverages Palo Alto's cybersecurity expertise alongside blockchain technology, it could unlock new revenue streams in data security and decentralized applications—markets projected to grow exponentially in the coming years.

For crypto investors, the implications are equally compelling. Institutional adoption has long been a holy grail for the industry, often cited as the catalyst for sustained price appreciation. Bitcoin and Ethereum, with their dominant market positions, stand to benefit most if Google's move sparks broader interest. Analysts are projecting short-term price targets of 10-15% gains for these assets over the next quarter, provided market sentiment improves. However, risks remain, including potential regulatory crackdowns and macroeconomic headwinds that could dampen enthusiasm.

Opportunities abound for those willing to navigate this uncertainty. Investing in blockchain-focused ETFs or individual cryptocurrencies could provide exposure to the sector's growth, while tech stocks like Alphabet offer a more traditional play on the trend. For a balanced approach, consider exploring both avenues. If you're ready to dive in, try a trusted trading platform to build your portfolio.

Let's zoom in on the numbers driving the crypto market in light of Google's acquisition. Bitcoin, priced at $89,279 as of December 22, 2025, shows a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 45, indicating a neutral stance—neither overbought nor oversold, per CoinGecko data. Ethereum, trading at $3,025.67, exhibits a Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) of 0.02, suggesting slight upward momentum. Trading volumes across major cryptocurrencies have increased by 5% in the past week, reflecting heightened investor activity amid news of the deal.

These indicators suggest a market in wait-and-see mode, poised for a breakout if positive catalysts emerge. Google's potential blockchain integration could be just that catalyst, driving adoption and, consequently, price appreciation. However, the Fear & Greed Index reading of 25 signals caution, reminding us that sentiment can shift quickly. Below is a snapshot of key metrics for the leading cryptocurrencies:

These figures highlight the stability of major cryptocurrencies even amidst market caution, underscoring their resilience as potential investment vehicles.

Looking ahead, the future of both tech and crypto markets hinges on how Google Cloud integrates Palo Alto Networks' capabilities and whether blockchain technology plays a central role. In a bullish scenario, Alphabet's focus on cybersecurity and decentralized solutions could drive innovation, attracting institutional investors and pushing Bitcoin and Ethereum prices higher. Analysts cited by Bloomberg suggest a potential 10-15% upside for these assets in the first quarter of 2026 if sentiment shifts.

Conversely, a bearish outlook looms if regulatory challenges intensify or macroeconomic conditions worsen. The SEC's recent guidelines on blockchain-based securities, announced in December 2025, aim for transparency but could impose compliance burdens. Similarly, the European Union's proposed crypto regulations emphasize consumer protection, potentially slowing adoption in key markets. Despite these risks, the long-term trajectory for blockchain remains promising, especially with tech giants like Google entering the fray.

ETH Crypto Chart

For investors, the key is to stay informed and agile. Monitoring regulatory developments and market sentiment will be critical in the months ahead. If you're looking to position yourself for potential gains, start trading now to take advantage of emerging opportunities.

This acquisition, finalized in December 2025, strengthens Google Cloud's cybersecurity offerings and could pave the way for blockchain integration into its infrastructure. It signals a growing convergence of tech and crypto, potentially driving institutional adoption of decentralized technologies.

While direct impacts are speculative, the deal has sparked interest among investors, with many anticipating increased blockchain adoption by major corporations. This could lead to higher demand for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, though market sentiment remains cautious with a Fear & Greed Index of 25.

The decision depends on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Tech stocks like Alphabet (GOOGL) offer stability with a recent 5% gain, while cryptocurrencies present higher risk but also higher potential rewards. Diversifying across both could be a prudent strategy. Consider platforms to open an account and explore your options.

Key risks include regulatory hurdles, as seen with recent SEC guidelines and EU proposals in December 2025, and macroeconomic uncertainties that could dampen market enthusiasm. Investor sentiment, currently at “Extreme Fear,” also poses a challenge to short-term growth.

Google's vast resources and infrastructure could accelerate blockchain's mainstream adoption, particularly in areas like data security and transaction efficiency. This could lead to innovative applications across industries, from finance to healthcare.

Stay updated with credible sources like Bloomberg and CNBC for the latest news. If you're ready to invest, explore opportunities with trusted trading platforms to build a diversified portfolio in tech and crypto assets.

BlackRock named its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) exchange-traded fund (ETF) one of the top three investment themes for 2025, a striking move given bitcoin's BTC$89,127.04 slide this year.

The firm placed IBIT alongside two more traditional offerings: the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and the iShares Top 20 U.S. Stocks ETF (TOPT).

Bitcoin has dropped more than 4% year-to-date, the first decline in three years, and IBIT has mirrored that performance. Even so, the ETF has seen strong investor interest. IBIT ranks sixth among all ETFs by 2025 inflows, pulling in over $25 billion since January.

“It's easy to frame this as BlackRock simply promoting its highest-revenue product,” said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store. “But I see it more as the firm doubling down on its conviction that bitcoin belongs in diversified portfolios.”

Geraci noted that BlackRock has other ETFs, like the gold-focused IAU, that are outperforming IBIT and charge higher fees. Yet the firm is spotlighting a product that underperformed in 2025, a rare move in an industry that typically pushes its top-performing funds.

“If the objective were purely revenue generation, BlackRock has no shortage of ETFs with significantly higher fees that it could emphasize instead,” he said. “Asset managers aren't typically in the business of spotlighting underperforming products, particularly when they have a deep bench of outperforming alternatives they could highlight.”

The inclusion of IBIT as a top 2025 theme signals a long-term bet on the crypto asset by the world's largest asset manager. For investors who still see crypto as speculative or fringe, BlackRock's positioning of bitcoin alongside cash and stocks may shift that perception.

Bitcoin traded near $88,800 on Monday as global markets leaned back into risk following record highs in gold and gains across Asian equities.

Ether climbed back above $3,000, while XRP, Solana and Dogecoin also edged higher after a volatile stretch that saw crypto prices swing sharply independent of stocks and commodities.

The steadier tone came as gold pushed to an all-time high above $4,380 an ounce, driven by growing bets that the Federal Reserve will deliver additional rate cuts in 2026. 

The metal is on track for its strongest annual performance since 1979, supported by central-bank buying and persistent inflows into gold-backed exchange-traded funds.

Asian stocks advanced alongside the move in precious metals. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose more than 1%, led by technology shares, after a rebound in U.S. equities late last week helped calm global markets. U.S. equity futures were also higher.

Japan remained in focus after the Bank of Japan's recent rate hike pushed government bond yields to multi-year highs. The yen strengthened after officials warned against excessive currency moves, while higher yields reinforced the shift away from years of ultra-loose policy.

Crypto followed the broader risk tone but remained fragile. Traders pointed to thin year-end liquidity and lingering leverage as factors keeping rallies in check.

Data from K33 Research shows long-term bitcoin holders are nearing the end of an extended selling phase, while institutional buyers have begun absorbing bitcoin faster than miners can produce it. Corporate treasuries and ETFs have increased purchases even after prices fell more than 30% from October highs.

Crypto continues to take cues from the macro backdrop — helped by rate-cut expectations and haven demand in gold, but restrained by the aftereffects of a deep fourth-quarter drawdown.

Strategy (MSTR), the largest publicly traded holder of bitcoin, lifted its cash reserve by $747.8 million last week.

The company's ""USD Reserve"" — intended as a fund through which Strategy can pay the dividends on its preferred stock — now stands at roughly $2.2 billion. This latest capital raise came entirely via the sales of the firm's common stock, according to a Monday SEC filing.

At that $2.2 billion, the reserve is now large enough to fund 32 months of preferred dividends.

In boosting its cash balance, Strategy chose not to add any bitcoin after two consecutive weeks of buying about $1 billion worth. The company continues to hold 671,268 BTC purchased for just over $50 billion and worth about $60.4 billion based on BTC's current price of roughly $90,000.

MSTR is higher by 3% premarket alongside bitcoin's modest weekend gain in price. The stock remains lower by more than 40% year-to-date.

JPMorgan Chase is weighing whether to offer cryptocurrency trading services to institutional clients, Bloomberg reported on Friday, citing a person familiar with the matter.

The move would make the largest U.S. bank by assets one of the most prominent financial institutions yet to consider entering the crypto trading space for major clients. According to the report, JPMorgan is assessing different types of products, including spot and derivatives trading, but has not committed to launching any specific service. The decision will depend on client demand, perceived risks and whether the bank sees long-term business opportunities in the sector.

JPMorgan's deliberations come as large investors — from hedge funds to pension managers — look for more secure and regulated ways to trade digital assets. These clients often can't or won't use retail-focused platforms like Coinbase (COIN) or Binance due to compliance, custody and trade execution concerns. Instead, they require dedicated infrastructure that can handle large trades, offer deeper liquidity and meet institutional compliance standards.

Coinbase Prime is one of the leaders in the U.S. as a crypto trading platform tailored for institutions, but competition is growing. Bullish, which owns CoinDesk, operates a digital asset exchange built for institutional trading. Kraken has a similar offering through its Kraken Institutional platform. Several other firms, including Fidelity Digital Assets and Galaxy Digital, are also active in the space. Now JPMorgan could be added to the mix. 

The U.S. regulatory environment around crypto has started to show signs of change, with an important crypto bill expected to be passed soon. That decision gave many institutions more confidence that digital asset markets are maturing under clearer rules, even as prices remain choppy through the end of the year.

A representative for JPMorgan didn't provide a comment on the story immediately.

The researchers are confident that this process can be applied to other material beyond diamonds as well.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Since their theoretical discovery in 2012, time crystals have been front-and-center in conversations about how to improve quantum computers. While diamond, ice, and any other solid you can think of has a crystal lattice structure that repeats in space (another name for them could be “space crystals”), time crystals, as their name suggests, oscillate in perpetual cycles across time. These crystals, the thinking goes, could form stable forms of quantum memory and error-free quantum circuits, drastically improving a quantum computer's performance. 

However, there is still a lot we don't know about time crystals—we only got our first visual of how these things work earlier this year—but one thing we do know is that not all time crystals are the same. For example, there are discrete (externally driven) and continuous (self-sustained) time crystals, and time crystals can contain varying properties beyond just these two categories. Case in point, a new study published in the journal Nature Physics explores the concept of a rondeau time crystal, a new phase of matter that contains both long-range temporal order and short-time disorder, according to Phys.org. 

“The motivation for this research stems from how order and variation coexist across art and nature,” Leo Moon, a Ph.D. student at University of California Berkeley and co-author of the study, told Phys.org. “Repetitive periodic patterns naturally arise in early art forms due to their simplicity, while more advanced music and poetry build intricate variations atop a monotonous background.”

In fact, one art form in particular inspired this new phase of matter's name. A “rondo” (or rondeau, as the early French harpsichord composers wrote it) is a repeating theme with variations mixed throughout. The most famous example of a rondo is likely Mozart's “Rondo alla Turca” (if the name doesn't sound familiar, believe me, you've definitely heard it). Relating back to physics, Phys.org notes that typical crystal lattices can also contain both order and disorder—oxygen atoms, for instance, form a repeating lattice in ice, while the hydrogen nuclei are spread randomly throughout. “Ice has ordered oxygen positions but disordered hydrogen bonds, and that local randomness carries structural information” Moon said. 

To explore this exotic temporal phase, the researchers relied on carbon-13 atoms in a diamond, which contain defects in the form of nitrogen atoms sitting next to empty spots in the lattice. These defects are known as “nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers,” and when illuminated with lasers, these centers become spin polarized. With microwave pulses boosting the polarization were combined with “protective ‘spin-locking' pulses with strategically timed polarization-flipping pulses,” Phys.org reports, Moon and his team created a rondeau crystal. Using ASCII (a character encoding standard), the researchers also successfully stored information in these timing pulses.

“Although our experiment focused on nuclear spins in a diamond, the underlying concept is immediately applicable to a wide swathe of quantum simulator platforms,” the authors wrote in the study. “Our experiments open a promising new avenue to investigate temporal order, demonstrating the long-lived stable coexistence of long-range temporal order and micromotion disorder at short timescales.”

A research team in Brazil has found strong evidence that the Joseph's Coat plant (Alternanthera littoralis) is both safe and effective at reducing inflammation, easing pain, and protecting against arthritis. The study was carried out by scientists from the Federal University of Grande Dourados (UFGD), the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), and São Paulo State University (UNESP).

Joseph's Coat grows naturally along Brazil's coastline and has long been used in traditional medicine to treat inflammation, infections, and parasitic illnesses. Despite its widespread use, there had been little scientific research confirming whether these benefits were real or whether the plant was safe.

Identifying Active Compounds and Testing Anti Inflammatory Effects

The study, published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology, began with a detailed chemical analysis of the plant. Researchers examined the ethanolic extract made from the plant's aerial parts to determine which bioactive compounds it contained. This phase of the work was led by Marcos Salvador, a pharmacist from the Institute of Biology (IB) at UNICAMP.

After identifying the compounds, the research moved to biological testing. A team led by pharmacologist Cândida Kassuya from the Faculty of Health Sciences at UFGD evaluated how well the extract reduced inflammation in experimental models of arthritis. Toxicological testing followed to assess safety. ""Finally, we performed the toxicological analyses under my coordination,"" explains Arielle Cristina Arena, associate professor in the Department of Structural and Functional Biology at the Institute of Biosciences at UNESP's Botucatu Campus.

Laboratory Results Show Reduced Inflammation and Joint Damage

The experiments revealed that the ethanolic extract of A. littoralis significantly lowered inflammation in laboratory animals. ""In the experimental models, we observed reduced edema, improved joint parameters, and modulation of inflammatory mediators, suggesting antioxidant and tissue-protective actions,"" says Arena.

These findings indicate that the plant does more than reduce swelling. The results also suggest that it may help protect joint tissue and limit damage associated with inflammatory conditions like arthritis.

Promising Safety Profile With Limits on Immediate Use

According to Arena, the results strengthen the scientific case for the plant's medicinal value and provide a foundation for future preclinical studies. The findings also point to a favorable safety profile at therapeutic doses, which could be encouraging for eventual human use.

However, the researchers caution that the extract is not ready for clinical application. Additional toxicological testing, human clinical trials, and standardized preparation methods are still required to confirm safety, effectiveness, and quality. Regulatory approval would also be necessary before any therapeutic use.

Supporting Biodiversity Through Science

""This research is part of an ongoing line of investigation developed by UFGD, UNESP, and UNICAMP, and our purpose is to value Brazilian biodiversity and traditional knowledge, but with a rigorous scientific basis, promoting the safe and rational use of natural products,"" says Arena.

The research received funding from FAPESP (projects 06/06079-4, 09/05992-6, 15/03726-8, 16/06407-3, 17/19523-4, and 21/09693-5).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This AI finds simple rules where humans see only chaos","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251221091237.htm","Mon, 22 Dec 2025 06:06:43 GMT","

Researchers at Duke University have created a new artificial intelligence framework designed to uncover clear, easy-to-understand rules behind some of the most complicated dynamics seen in nature and modern technology.

The system is inspired by the work of history's great ""dynamicists"" -- scientists who study systems that change over time. Just as Isaac Newton, often considered the first dynamicist, developed equations linking force and motion, this AI analyzes data that shows how complex systems evolve and then produces equations that accurately describe that behavior.

What sets this approach apart is its ability to handle complexity far beyond human capacity. The AI can take nonlinear systems involving hundreds or even thousands of interacting variables and reduce them to simpler rules with far fewer dimensions.

A New Tool for Understanding Change Over Time

The research, published December 17 online in the journal npj Complexity, introduces a powerful new way for scientists to use AI to study systems that evolve over time -- including weather patterns, electrical circuits, mechanical devices, and biological signals.

""Scientific discovery has always depended on finding simplified representations of complicated processes,"" said Boyuan Chen, director of the General Robotics Lab and the Dickinson Family Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science at Duke. ""We increasingly have the raw data needed to understand complex systems, but not the tools to turn that information into the kinds of simplified rules scientists rely on. Bridging that gap is essential.""

A classic example of simplification comes from physics. The path of a cannon ball depends on many factors, including launch speed and angle, air resistance, changing wind conditions, and even ambient temperature. Despite this complexity, a close approximation of its motion can be captured with a simple linear equation that uses only the launch speed and angle.

Building on a Decades-Old Mathematical Idea

This kind of simplification reflects a theoretical concept introduced by mathematician Bernard Koopman in the 1930s. Koopman showed that complex nonlinear systems can be represented mathematically using linear models. The new AI framework builds directly on this idea.

There is an important challenge, however. Representing highly complex systems with linear models often requires constructing hundreds or even thousands of equations, each tied to a different variable. Handling that level of complexity is difficult for human researchers.

That is where artificial intelligence becomes especially valuable.

How the AI Reduces Complexity

The framework studies time-series data from experiments and identifies the most meaningful patterns in how a system changes. It combines deep learning with constraints inspired by physics to narrow down the system to a much smaller set of variables that still capture its essential behavior. The outcome is a compact model that behaves mathematically like a linear system while remaining faithful to real-world complexity.

To test the approach, the researchers applied it to a wide variety of systems. These ranged from the familiar swinging motion of a pendulum to the nonlinear behavior of electrical circuits, as well as models used in climate science and neural circuits. Although these systems differ greatly, the AI consistently uncovered a small number of hidden variables that governed their behavior. In many cases, the resulting models were more than 10 times smaller than those produced by earlier machine-learning methods, while still delivering reliable long-term predictions.

""What stands out is not just the accuracy, but the interpretability,"" said Chen, who also holds appointments in electrical and computer engineering and computer science. ""When a linear model is compact, the scientific discovery process can be naturally connected to existing theories and methods that human scientists have developed over millennia. It's like connecting AI scientists with human scientists.""

Finding Stability and Warning Signs

The framework does more than make predictions. It can also identify stable states, known as attractors, where a system naturally settles over time. Recognizing these states is critical for determining whether a system is operating normally, slowly drifting, or approaching instability.

""For a dynamicist, finding these structures is like finding the landmarks of a new landscape,"" said Sam Moore, the lead author and PhD candidate in Chen's General Robotics Lab. ""Once you know where the stable points are, the rest of the system starts to make sense.""

The researchers note that this method is especially useful when traditional equations are unavailable, incomplete, or too complex to derive. ""This is not about replacing physics,"" Moore continued. ""It's about extending our ability to reason using data when the physics is unknown, hidden, or too cumbersome to write down.""

Toward Machine Scientists

Looking ahead, the team is exploring how the framework could help guide experimental design by actively selecting which data to collect in order to reveal a system's structure more efficiently. They also plan to apply the method to richer forms of data, including video, audio, and signals from complex biological systems.

This research supports a long-term goal in Chen's General Robotics Lab to develop ""machine scientists"" that assist with automated scientific discovery. By linking modern AI with the mathematical language of dynamical systems, the work points toward a future in which AI does more than recognize patterns. It may help uncover the fundamental rules that shape both the physical world and living systems.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A new drug could stop Alzheimer's before memory loss begins","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251222080119.htm","Mon, 22 Dec 2025 13:12:46 GMT","

An experimental drug developed at Northwestern University has demonstrated further promise as an early intervention for Alzheimer's disease.

In a new study, Northwestern scientists identified a previously unknown highly toxic sub-species of amyloid beta oligomers -- toxic clusters of peptides -- that appear to drive several of the brain's earliest changes, including neuronal dysfunction, inflammation and activation of immune cells.

The experimental drug, a small-molecule compound called NU-9, decreased this toxic amyloid beta oligomersubtype and dramatically reduced the damage it causes in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. By addressing these changes at the onset of Alzheimer's disease, the researchers are hopeful NU-9 potentially could prevent, or significantly delay, the cascade of toxic events that ultimately destroy neurons.

The findings point to a potential new strategy for targeting the disease in its earliest stages -- before cognitive decline and other debilitating symptoms take hold.

The study will be published on Dec. 18 in Alzheimer's and Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association.

""Alzheimer's disease begins decades before its symptoms appear, with early events like toxic amyloid beta oligomers accumulating inside neurons and glial cells becoming reactive long before memory loss is apparent,"" said Northwestern's Daniel Kranz, the study's first author. ""By the time symptoms emerge, the underlying pathology is already advanced. This is likely a major reason many clinical trials have failed. They start far too late. In our study, we administered NU-9 before symptom onset, modeling this early, pre-symptomatic window.""

Kranz is a recent Ph.D. graduate from the Interdisciplinary Biological Sciences (IBiS) program at Northwestern's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, where he is advised by corresponding author William Klein. An expert on Alzheimer's disease, Klein is a professor of neurobiology at Weinberg and a cofounder of Acumen Pharmaceuticals, which has developed a therapeutic monoclonal antibody currently in clinical trials that targets the subtype of amyloid beta oligomers identified in the study. Richard Silverman, a key co-author of the study, invented NU-9. Silverman, who previously invented pregabalin (Lyrica) to treat fibromyalgia, nerve pain and epilepsy, is the Patrick G. Ryan/Aon Professor in Weinberg's Department of Chemistry and founder of Akava Therapeutics, a startup company commercializing NU-9 (now called AKV9).

The promise of NU-9

Conceived about 15 years ago, NU-9 emerged as part of Silverman's multi-year effort to discover a small molecule compound that could prevent toxic protein aggregate buildup in neurodegenerative diseases. By 2021, NU-9 demonstrated efficacy in animal models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), clearing toxic SOD1 and TDP-43 proteins and restoring health to upper motor neurons. In 2024, it received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to begin human clinical trials for ALS.

Earlier this year, Silverman, Klein and Kranz demonstrated that NU-9 also could effectively treat Alzheimer's disease. In the previous study, NU-9 showed it could clear toxic amyloid beta oligomers in lab-grown brain cells from the hippocampus, a region critical for learning and memory.

""In both ALS and Alzheimer's disease, cells suffer from toxic protein buildup,"" Klein said. ""Cells have a mechanism to get rid of these proteins, but it gets damaged in degenerative diseases like ALS and Alzheimer's. NU-9 is rescuing the pathway that saves the cell.""

Early intervention

To further investigate the drug's potential in treating Alzheimer's disease, the team wanted to evaluate its effectiveness at halting the earliest damage. In the new study, the researchers administered NU-9 to a pre-symptomatic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. The mice received a daily oral dose for 60 days.

The results were striking. NU-9 significantly reduced early reactive astrogliosis, an inflammatory reaction that typically begins long before symptoms appear. The number of toxic amyloid beta oligomers bound to astrocytes (star-shaped brain cells that protect neurons and control inflammation) also plummeted. And an abnormal form of the protein TDP-43 -- a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases that is linked to cognitive impairments -- sharply decreased.

""These results are stunning,"" Klein said. ""NU-9 had an outstanding effect on reactive astrogliosis, which is the essence of neuroinflammation and linked to the early stage of the disease.""

The improvements spanned multiple regions of the brain, indicating that NU-9 has a brain-wide anti-inflammatory effect.

A hidden culprit

While investigating the effects of NU-9 on the pre-symptomatic mouse model, the research team found an unexpected culprit. For decades, scientists have considered amyloid beta oligomers as more toxic than the larger amyloid beta fibrils that form plaques, which appear later in Alzheimer's disease. But not all amyloid beta oligomers are the same. The Northwestern scientists discovered one uniquely problematic subtype.

""We identified a distinct amyloid beta oligomer subtype that appears inside neurons and on nearby reactive astrocytes very early in the disease,"" Kranz said. ""It potentially acts as an instigator of early Alzheimer's pathology.""

Called ACU193+ because it is detected by the antibody ACU193, the subtype shows up early inside of stressed neurons, the scientists found. Then, these oligomers appear to migrate to the surfaces of nearby astrocytes. When ACU193+ oligomers latch onto astrocytes, they may spark a cascade of inflammation that spreads throughout the brain, long before memory loss begins.

A potential prophylaxis

NU-9 targeted and dramatically reduced this subtype, suggesting the drug may be especially valuable at Alzheimer's earliest stages, when intervention is most effective. By reducing this subtype, NU-9 potentially could prevent the activation of astrocytes.

Although they serve as the brain's frontline responders, astrocytes become destructive when pushed into a reactive state. This destructive behavior damages synapses, releases inflammatory molecules and accelerates neurodegeneration. Stopping this process might be one of the most powerful ways to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease.

Kranz and Silverman likened the strategy to early intervention approaches for preventing cancer and heart disease.

""Most people are used to monitoring their cholesterol levels,"" Silverman said. ""If you have high cholesterol, it doesn't mean that you will have a heart attack soon. But it's time to take drugs to lower your cholesterol levels to prevent that heart attack from happening down the road. NU-9 could play a similar role. If someone has a biomarker signaling Alzheimer's disease, then they could start taking NU-9 before symptoms appear.""

""There are a couple early diagnostic blood tests for Alzheimer's disease in development,"" Klein added. ""The promise of better early diagnostics -- combined with a drug that could stop the disease in its tracks -- is the goal.""

Currently, the team is testing NU-9 in additional models of Alzheimer's disease, including an animal model of late-onset disease that better reflects typical human aging. The researchers also plan to follow animals for a longer period of time to determine whether symptoms develop in treated animals and plan to examine how early intervention with NU-9 affects memory and neuron health over time.

The study, ""Identification of a glia-associated amyloid beta oligomer subtype and the rescue from reactive astrogliosis by inhibitor NU-9,"" was supported by the National Institute of Health (grant AG061708).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Parkinson's breakthrough changes what we know about dopamine","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251221043225.htm","Mon, 22 Dec 2025 06:40:15 GMT","

A new study led by researchers at McGill University is calling into question a long-standing idea about how dopamine influences movement. The findings suggest a shift in how scientists understand Parkinson's disease and how its treatments work.

The research, published in Nature Neuroscience, shows that dopamine does not directly control how fast or how forcefully a person moves, as many experts previously believed. Instead, dopamine appears to provide the basic conditions that allow movement to happen in the first place.

""Our findings suggest we should rethink dopamine's role in movement,"" said senior author Nicolas Tritsch, Assistant Professor in McGill's Department of Psychiatry and researcher at the Douglas Research Centre. ""Restoring dopamine to a normal level may be enough to improve movement. That could simplify how we think about Parkinson's treatment.""

What Dopamine Does in Parkinson's Disease

Dopamine plays a key role in motor vigor, which refers to the ability to move with speed and strength. In people with Parkinson's disease, the brain cells that produce dopamine gradually break down. This loss leads to hallmark symptoms such as slow movement, tremors, and problems with balance.

Levodopa, the most common treatment for Parkinson's, helps restore movement by increasing dopamine levels in the brain. However, scientists have not fully understood why the drug is so effective. In recent years, improved brain-monitoring tools detected brief spikes of dopamine during movement. These rapid bursts led many researchers to think dopamine directly controlled movement intensity.

The new findings challenge that assumption.

Dopamine Acts as Support, Not a Speed Controller

The study suggests dopamine does not act as a moment-by-moment controller of movement. Instead, it serves a more fundamental role.

""Rather than acting as a throttle that sets movement speed, dopamine appears to function more like engine oil. It's essential for the system to run, but not the signal that determines how fast each action is executed,"" said Tritsch.

Tracking Dopamine in Real Time

To test this idea, the researchers monitored brain activity in mice while the animals pressed a weighted lever. Using a light-based method, they were able to switch dopamine-producing cells ""on"" or ""off"" during the task.

If rapid dopamine bursts were responsible for movement vigor, changing dopamine levels at that exact moment should have altered how fast or forcefully the mice moved. Instead, adjusting dopamine activity during movement made no difference.

When the researchers tested levodopa, they found that the drug improved movement by raising the brain's overall dopamine level. It did not work by restoring the short-lived dopamine bursts that occur during motion.

Toward More Targeted Parkinson's Treatments

More than 110,000 Canadians are currently living with Parkinson's disease, and that number is expected to more than double by 2050 as the population ages.

According to the researchers, a better understanding of why levodopa works could guide the development of future treatments that focus on maintaining steady dopamine levels rather than targeting rapid dopamine signals.

The findings also encourage researchers to reexamine older treatment strategies. Dopamine receptor agonists have shown benefits in the past but often caused side effects because they affected large areas of the brain. The new insight may help scientists design safer therapies that act more precisely.

About the Study

""Subsecond dopamine fluctuations do not specify the vigor of ongoing actions"" by Haixin Liu and Nicolas Tritsch et al., was published in Nature Neuroscience.

The study was funded by the Canada First Research Excellence Fund, awarded through the Healthy Brains, Healthy Lives initiative at McGill University and the Fonds de Recherche du Québec.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This simulation reveals what really happens near black holes","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251222044106.htm","Mon, 22 Dec 2025 10:28:43 GMT","

After decades of steady progress, computational astrophysicists have reached a major turning point in black hole research. A new study presents the most detailed and complete model yet of luminous black hole accretion, the process by which black holes pull in surrounding matter and emit intense radiation. Using some of the most powerful supercomputers on Earth, the researchers successfully calculated how matter flows into black holes while fully accounting for both Einstein's theory of gravity and the dominant role of radiation, without relying on simplifying shortcuts.

This achievement marks the first time such calculations have been carried out in full general relativity under radiation-dominated conditions. The results open a new window into how black holes behave in extreme environments that were previously out of reach for simulations.

Who Led the Research and Where It Was Published

The study was published in The Astrophysical Journal and led by scientists from the Institute for Advanced Study and the Flatiron Institute's Center for Computational Astrophysics. It represents the first paper in a planned series that will introduce the team's new computational framework and apply it to different types of black hole systems.

""This is the first time we've been able to see what happens when the most important physical processes in black hole accretion are included accurately. These systems are extremely nonlinear -- any over-simplifying assumption can completely change the outcome. What's most exciting is that our simulations now reproduce remarkably consistent behaviors across black hole systems seen in the sky, from ultraluminous X-ray sources to X-ray binaries. In a sense, we've managed to 'observe' these systems not through a telescope, but through a computer,"" said lead author Lizhong Zhang.

Zhang is a joint postdoctoral research fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study's School of Natural Sciences and the Flatiron Institute's Center for Computational Astrophysics. He began the project during his first year at IAS (2023-24) and continued the work at Flatiron.

Why Black Hole Models Need Relativity and Radiation

Any realistic model of a black hole must include general relativity, since the intense gravity of these objects bends space and time in extreme ways. But gravity alone is not enough. When large amounts of matter fall toward a black hole, enormous energy is released in the form of radiation. Accurately tracking how that radiation moves through curved spacetime and interacts with nearby gas is essential for understanding what astronomers actually observe.

Until now, simulations could not fully handle this combination of effects. Like simplified classroom models that capture only part of a real system, earlier approaches relied on assumptions that made the calculations manageable but incomplete.

""Previous methods used approximations that treat radiation as a sort of fluid, which does not reflect its actual behavior,"" Zhang explained.

Solving the Full Equations Without Shortcuts

Those approximations were once unavoidable because the underlying equations are extraordinarily complex and demand massive computational resources. By combining insights developed over many years, the team created new algorithms capable of solving these equations directly, without approximations.

""Ours is the only algorithm that exists at the moment that provides a solution by treating radiation as it really is in general relativity,"" Zhang said.

This breakthrough allows researchers to simulate black hole environments with a level of realism that was previously impossible.

Focusing on Stellar Mass Black Holes

The study focuses on stellar mass black holes, which typically have about 10 times the mass of the Sun. These objects are much smaller than Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, but they offer unique advantages for study.

While astronomers have produced detailed images of supermassive black holes, stellar mass black holes appear only as tiny points of light. Scientists must analyze their emitted light by breaking it into a spectrum, which reveals how energy is distributed around the black hole. Because stellar mass black holes evolve over minutes to hours rather than years or centuries, they allow researchers to observe rapid changes in real time.

Simulations That Match Real Observations

Using their new model, the researchers followed how matter spirals inward, forming turbulent, radiation-dominated disks around stellar mass black holes. The simulations also showed strong winds flowing outward and, in some cases, the formation of powerful jets.

Crucially, the simulated light spectra closely matched what astronomers observe from real systems. This strong agreement makes it possible to draw more confident conclusions from limited observational data and deepens scientists' understanding of how these distant objects operate.

Supercomputers Powering the Breakthrough

The Institute for Advanced Study has a long history of advancing science through computational modeling. One early milestone was the Electronic Computer Project led by founding Professor (1933-55) John von Neumann, which influenced fields ranging from fluid dynamics to climate science and nuclear physics.

Continuing that tradition, Zhang and his colleagues were granted access to two of the world's most powerful supercomputers, Frontier at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Aurora at Argonne National Laboratory. These exascale machines can perform a quintillion calculations per second and occupy thousands of square feet -- recalling the massive size of the earliest computers.

Harnessing this computing power required sophisticated mathematics and software designed specifically for the task. Christopher White of the Flatiron Institute and Princeton University led the development of the radiation transport algorithm. Patrick Mullen, Member (2021-22) in the School of Natural Sciences and now at Los Alamos National Laboratory, led the integration of this algorithm into the AthenaK code, which is optimized for exascale systems.

What Comes Next for Black Hole Research

The team plans to test whether their approach can be applied to all types of black holes. Beyond stellar mass systems, the simulations may also shed new light on supermassive black holes, which play a central role in shaping galaxies. Future work will further refine how radiation interacts with matter across a wide range of temperatures and densities.

""What makes this project unique is, on the one hand, the time and effort it has taken to develop the applied mathematics and software capable of modeling these complex systems, and, on the other hand, having a very large allocation on the world's largest supercomputers to perform these calculations,"" said co-author James Stone, Professor in the Institute for Advanced Study's School of Natural Sciences. ""Now the task is to understand all the science that is coming out of it.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Why one long walk may be better than many short ones","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251221043233.htm","Mon, 22 Dec 2025 11:38:45 GMT","

A large population-based study examined whether the way people accumulate their daily steps affects their long-term health, regardless of how many total steps they take. The research focused on adults who were not highly active, defined as walking fewer than 8,000 steps per day (<8,000 steps per day). The findings showed a clear pattern: people who walked in longer, uninterrupted sessions faced lower risks of death from any cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with those whose steps were spread out in short bursts. The study was published in Annals of Internal Medicine.

The analysis included 33,560 adults from the UK Biobank who averaged 8000 or fewer daily steps. Researchers grouped participants based on how long their typical walking sessions lasted. These categories included bouts shorter than 5 minutes, 5 to shorter than 10 minutes, 10 to shorter than 15 minutes, and 15 minutes or longer.

Participants walked a median of 5,165 steps per day. Nearly half of them, 42.9%, accumulated most of their steps in sessions lasting under 5 minutes. Another 33.5% primarily walked in 5- to 10-minute bouts, while 15.5% did most of their walking in 10- to 15-minute sessions. Only 8.0% regularly walked in sessions lasting at least 15 minutes.

Mortality Risk Drops as Walking Sessions Get Longer

Over a follow-up period of 9.5 years, the risk of death decreased steadily as walking sessions became longer. Participants who took most of their steps in bouts shorter than 5 minutes had an all-cause mortality risk of 4.36% (95% CI, 3.52% to 5.19%). That risk dropped to 1.83% (CI, 1.29% to 2.36%) among those walking in 5- to 10-minute bouts.

Even lower risks were seen in people who walked longer at a time. Those whose steps mainly came from 10- to 15-minute sessions had a mortality risk of 0.84% (CI, 0.13% to 1.53%), while participants who regularly walked for 15 minutes or more at a stretch had a risk of 0.80% (CI, 0.00% to 1.89%).

Heart Disease Risk Shows an Even Stronger Pattern

The connection between walking patterns and cardiovascular disease was even more pronounced. After 9.5 years, participants who mostly walked in sessions shorter than 5 minutes had a cumulative CVD risk of 13.03% (CI, 11.92% to 14.14%). Those who walked in 5- to 10-minute bouts had a lower risk of 11.09% (CI, 9.88% to 12.29%).

Risk continued to decline with longer walking sessions. Participants in the 10- to 15-minute group had a CVD risk of 7.71% (CI, 5.67% to 9.70%), while those walking in bouts of 15 minutes or longer had the lowest risk at 4.39% (CI, 1.89% to 6.83%).

Bigger Benefits for the Most Sedentary Adults

Among participants who were especially inactive, defined as taking fewer than 5,000 steps per day (<5,000 steps per day), the advantages of longer walking sessions were even more noticeable. In this group, walking for longer periods at a time was strongly associated with lower risks of both death and cardiovascular disease.

These findings suggest that for people who are otherwise sedentary or low-active, focusing on longer, more intentional walking sessions could be an effective way to improve health outcomes, even without increasing total step counts.

The inflammatory reflex, in which vagus nerve signaling modulates cytokine production, is dysregulated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RESET-RA, a pivotal, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial, evaluated a vagus nerve-targeted neuromodulation system for RA in 242 patients with inadequate response/intolerance to biological/targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Patients were randomized to active or sham stimulation for 3 months, and then all received open-label stimulation with results reported to 12 months. The primary end point was 3-month American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) response. ACR20 rates were higher with active simulation than with sham at 3 months (35.2% versus 24.2%, P = 0.0209), which further improved in open-label to 50.0% at 6 months and 52.8% at 12 months (all-completers). Adverse events occurred in a similar proportion of patients in both arms. Related serious adverse events (rate = 1.6%) were all perioperative, and resolved. Vagus nerve-mediated neuroimmune modulation for RA achieved its primary efficacy end point and produced durable clinical benefits with a favorable safety profile. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT04539964.

Patients with uncontrolled rheumatoid arthritis (RA) suffer from painful chronic joint inflammation, systemic inflammation and progressive disability due to ongoing structural joint damage. Despite the availability of numerous conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs; for example, methotrexate) and biological or targeted synthetic DMARDs (b/tsDMARDs) with distinct mechanisms of action, treatment failure remains a challenge for many patients due to lack of initial response, loss of response over time or intolerance to b/tsDMARDs1,2.

The central nervous system governs homeostatic control of immune responses and bone turnover through innate neuroimmune and osteo-targeted reflexes, including the vagus nerve-mediated ‘inflammatory reflex'. This reflex is dysregulated in RA; tonic vagus nerve activity is diminished, and reduction in vagal tone precedes the onset of clinical disease3,4,5. Actively stimulating the vagus nerve can engage the inflammatory reflex, resulting in acetylcholine release and specific agonism of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on immune cells6,7. Subsequent modulation of intracellular pathways acting through NFkB, JAK/STAT and the inflammasome leads to reduced production of an array of proinflammatory cytokines (for example, TNF, IL-6, IL-1β)8. This broad-spectrum immunomodulation retains cytokine network bioavailability, thereby allowing reduction and resolution of inflammation while maintaining competent immunosurveillance against foreign pathogens and precancerous cells9,10,11.

Prior clinical studies of implanted devices support this mechanism of action as a treatment approach for RA12,13,14. In these studies, a total of 27 patients with RA were stimulated with implanted neurostimulators targeting the vagus nerve and although not designed to determine efficacy, demonstrated clinical improvements with reductions in proinflammatory cytokines12,13. Accordingly, we studied the safety and efficacy of an integrated neuromodulation system to treat patients with moderately-to-severely active RA following an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more b/tsDMARDs, in the pivotal (similar to a phase III drug trial) RESET-RA trial.

We observed in this randomized, controlled trial of 242 patients that the primary end point of a difference between stimulation and sham in American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) responses at 3 months was achieved, with further clinical improvements documented at 12 months.

Following approval by the institutional review board (Advarra centrally and three local boards), a total of 405 patients diagnosed with RA were screened for study participation, 243 were consented and enrolled, and 242 completed standard b/tsDMARD washout per protocol requirements before device implantation (intent-to-treat (ITT) population). Figure 1 provides patient disposition from screening through 12 months. Patients were randomized to either arm 1 (stimulation treatment for 3 months, then continued to open-label stimulation; 122 patients) or arm 2 (sham treatment for 3 months, then crossover to open-label stimulation; 120 patients) following postsurgical recovery. One consented patient was discontinued from the study before device implantation for logistical reasons; the patient was not randomized but was followed for safety per protocol. A single patient randomized to arm 1 did not continue in the study after the 3-month primary end point. The demographics and clinical characteristics of the patients at baseline are presented in Table 1 and Supplementary Tables 1–3. Overall, mean duration of RA was 12.4 years, and the mean (s.d.) and median (range) number of prior b/tsDMARDs was 2.6 (1.9) and 2.0 (1–12), respectively. The total number of patients (% overall population) who had prior exposure to 1 b/tsDMARD was 94 (38.8%), those exposed to >1 b/tsDMARDs was 148 (61.2%), those exposed to ≥3 b/tsDMARDs were 95 (39.3%) and to a tsDMARD were 49 (20.2%). At the time of consent, 78.5% of patients were taking stable doses of a single csDMARD, of which 51.1% were receiving methotrexate. The remainder received at least two csDMARDs. Open-label data are reported through 12 months; 233 patients from the ITT population completed the 12-month visit.

The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-conditional pulse generator, the ‘implant', was implanted and fitted within a contoured silicone pod that was secured directly to the left cervical vagus nerve15 (Fig. 2). Once implanted, targeted electrical pulses were delivered to the vagus nerve to engage the inflammatory reflex and modulate immune activity. The stimulation parameters were controlled by site-specific programmers using a tablet-based software application that transmitted information through a charger worn by the patient (Fig. 2). Those patients randomized to sham stimulation always received 0 mA, regardless of the stimulation strength set by the programmers, who were blinded to treatment arm assignment.

The integrated neuromodulation system consists of an implant and pod. The implant is placed in the pod to position and hold it in place on the left cervical vagus nerve to ensure direct contact for precise stimulation. The implant is approximately 2.5 cm in length and weighs 2.6 g. To charge the implant, patients wear a wireless device (charger) around the neck for a few minutes, once a week. The implant is programmed by healthcare providers (HCPs) using a proprietary application (programmer). Adapted from ref. 16, by permission of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

The active stimulation intensity was set to an upper comfort level (maximum = 2.5 mA) and delivered a 1-min train of pulses to the vagus nerve once daily at 10 Hz16 (arm 1 = 1.8 mA average; arm 2 = 0 mA). The 3-month assessments were completed for 99.2% of patients, with two missed visits (one in each arm). Supplementary medications that were prohibited per protocol before the 3-month assessment (‘rescue') occurred in four patients in arm 1, and five patients in arm 2. All patients, healthcare providers, investigators, joint evaluators and the sponsor were blinded to group assignment until all patients completed assessments at 3 months and the database was locked for primary efficacy analysis.

Following the primary end point assessment at 3 months, all patients were eligible to continue in the study for open-label active stimulation treatment. Adjunctive pharmacological treatments (‘augmented therapy') were permitted throughout the open-label stimulation period at the discretion of the rheumatologist in consultation with the patient, with 17.8%, 24.8% and 32.2% of patients receiving protocol-defined augmented therapy at 6, 9 and 12 months, respectively. At these timepoints, 88.0%, 80.6% and 75.2% of patients remained free from adjunctive b/tsDMARD therapy. During the open-label stimulation period, 96.3% of patients in the ITT population completed 12-month assessments.

The primary end point was a difference in proportion of patients in the ITT population receiving stimulation versus sham who achieved an ACR20 response at the 3-month visit from baseline (day of consent). ACR20 response, as defined by the American College of Rheumatology, is a dichotomous composite end point representing the proportion of patients who achieve at least a 20% improvement in both the tender and swollen joint counts (out of a maximum of 28 joints) and in ≥3 of the following 5 additional measures—Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) score, patient global assessment of disease, patient pain, evaluator's global assessment of disease and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentration17. The primary end point was met at 3 months; ACR20 response was achieved by 35.2% of arm 1 (stimulation) and by 24.2% of arm 2 (sham; Fig. 3a). The stratification-adjusted difference in ACR20 response between arms was 11.8% (P = 0.0209, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.6, 23.1). At 3 months, Bang's blinding index scores were <0.3 for patients, joint assessors and co-investigators, which indicated satisfactory blinding at the time of primary end point assessment (Supplementary Table 4).

Formal statistical analyses were only performed at the 3-month study visit (double-blind) with the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel (CMH) test using stratification factors based on prespecified criteria (prior inadequate or lost response to a tsDMARD, prior inadequate or lost response to ≥4 biological DMARDs with ≥2 mechanisms of action and RA disease severity defined as either <4 TJC28 or <4 SJC28 at day 0), at a one-sided significance level of 0.025. P = 0.0209, 95% CI = 0.6–23.1 (a,b). P = 0.0048, 95% CI = 7.3–31.7 (c). P = 0.0154, 95% CI = 1.2–21.6 (d). After 3 months (open-label stimulation), patients were permitted to augment therapy with adjunctive drugs without restriction. Data presented at 6, 9 and 12 months in b–d include all patients completing the visit who had not used augmented therapy.

Four key secondary end points were evaluated, each representing the difference in the proportion of patients in the ITT population receiving stimulation versus sham who achieved the end point at 3 months. End points included a DAS28-CRP good/moderate response according to the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria; a DAS28-CRP minimal clinically important difference (MCID; −1.2); a HAQ-DI MCID (−0.22); and an ACR20 response from day 0 (randomization). Among the key secondary end points, multiplicity adjustment was performed using Hochberg's step-up procedure. All secondary end points showed a higher response rate for stimulation compared to sham, although significance was achieved for only EULAR good/moderate response (Supplementary Table 5). EULAR good/moderate response was achieved by 60.7% of arm 1 (stimulation) and by 41.7% of arm 2 (sham) (multiplicity-adjusted P = 0.0048, 95% CI = 7.3, 31.7). DAS28-CRP MCID was achieved by 45.1% of arm 1 and by 32.5% of arm 2 (multiplicity-adjusted P = 0.0528, 95% CI = 1.1, 25.3). HAQ-DI MCID was achieved by 45.9% of arm 1 and by 36.7% of arm 2 (multiplicity-adjusted P = 0.0797, 95% CI = −3.3, 21.4). ACR20 from day 0 was achieved by 31.1% of arm 1 and by 22.5% of arm 2 (multiplicity-adjusted P = 0.0797, 95% CI = 1.1, 25.3).

All other efficacy end points at 3 months and within the open-label stimulation period were exploratory. Open-label stimulation was initiated in both arms after the 3-month controlled-blind period. Response rates for primary and all secondary end points increased further in arm 1, while patients in arm 2 demonstrated clinical improvements following initiation of stimulation. Clinical end point responses were sustained in both arms through 12 months (Supplementary Table 5).

Prespecified clinically relevant composite outcome measures included EULAR good/moderate response, low disease activity (LDA) or remission by DAS28-CRP, and LDA or remission by the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) evaluated at 3 months (sham-controlled-blinded period) and also during the open-label stimulation period at 6 months, 9 months and 12 months (Fig. 3c,d and Supplementary Table 6). Arm 1 (stimulated) had significantly higher rates than arm 2 (sham) at 3 months for EULAR good/moderate response (% responders ± s.e.m.—arm 1 = 60.7% ± 4, arm 2 = 41.7% ± 5; P = 0.0048, 95% CI = 7.3, 31.7) and DAS28-CRP LDA/remission (% rate ± s.e.m.—arm 1 = 26.1% ± 4, arm 2 = 15.4% ± 3; P = 0.0154, 95% CI = 1.2, 21.6). Difference in rates for CDAI LDA/remission at 3 months did not reach significance (% rate ± s.e.m.—arm 1 = 23.3% ± 4, arm 2 = 16.0% ± 3; P = 0.0648, 95% CI = −2.1, 17.7), although favored stimulation.

All composite outcome measures improved further in both arms during the open-label period, when all patients received stimulation, with responses maintained at 12 months. Across both arms, the percentage of patients who achieved an ACR20 response at 12 months was 57.6%, EULAR good/moderate response was 77.3%, DAS28-CRP LDA/remission was 44.8%, and CDAI LDA/remission was 43.9% by a nonaugmented analysis (Fig. 3b–d and Supplementary Table 6). Comparable results were observed by an all-completers analysis, which additionally included those patients who received augmented therapy (Supplementary Table 6). Patient satisfaction rate using a five-point Likert rating scale revealed that 78.1% of patients were somewhat to very satisfied with the therapy at 6 months (satisfaction %—arm 1 = 75.6%, arm 2 = 80.7%; Supplementary Table 10).

Treatment effects on joint inflammation and erosions were assessed using gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the hand and wrist at baseline (pre-implant), 3 months and 6 months. Images were analyzed with the validated Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) RA MRI score (RAMRIS) to objectively quantify bone erosion progression18. In the ITT population, a total of 216 patients had RAMRIS scores measured at both baseline and 3 months (arm 1, n = 109; arm 2, n = 107). At baseline, bone erosion scores were comparable between arm 1 and arm 2, with a mean (s.d.) erosion score of 10.4 (11.7) and 9.5 (12.1), respectively. From baseline to 3 months, a smaller proportion of patients in arm 1 (stimulation) exhibited progression of bone erosions (>0.5 increase in score) in the evaluated hand and wrist compared with arm 2, although the difference was not significant (P = 0.248; Fig. 4c,g). In the prespecified subgroup analysis of patients with a phenotype enriched for erosive damage risk (defined as synovitis score of 2 or more on any individual joint, at least four joints with a score of 1 or any joint with osteitis at baseline), a total of 105 patients met the erosive phenotype criteria (arm 1, n = 57; arm 2, n = 48). In this subgroup, the rate of progression of bone erosion from baseline to 3 months was significantly decreased in arm 1 (stimulation = 18.9%) as compared with arm 2 (sham = 37.8%, P = 0.016; Fig. 4e,h). During the open-label stimulation period from 3 months to 6 months, the rate of progression of bone erosion declined in arm 2 (Fig. 4g,h).

The vertical line at 3 months demarcates the double-blind period between baseline and 3 months and the open-label stimulation period between 3 months and 6 months. Data are presented as the mean (a,b) or the percentage of each group (g,h) with s.e. Statistical analyses were only performed at points through 3 months; a and b with mixed-effect model repeated measures and g and h with the CMH test. All tests use one-sided significance level of 0.025. In a, P = 0.0021, 0.0004 and 0.0014 at month 1, 2 and 3, respectively. In b, P = 0.0097, 0.0009 and 0.0131 at month 1, 2 and 3, respectively. *P < 0.025, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.

Primary and secondary end point response measures during the open-label period were consistent with analyses using nonresponder imputation to account for missed visits or study dropouts (Supplementary Table 5). At 12 months from baseline, ACR20 response by nonresponder imputation were 50.4% (61/121) and 51.7% (62/120) for arm 1 and arm 2, respectively; EULAR good/moderate response was 70.2% (85/121) and 70.8% (85/120) for arm 1 and arm 2, respectively; DAS28-CRP MCID was 60.3% (73/121) and 55.8% (67/120) for arm 1 and arm 2, respectively; and HAQ-DI MCID was 54.5% (66/121) and 55.8% (67/120) for arm 1 and arm 2, respectively.

The safety evaluation was based on all available data at the time of reporting, with a mean implant duration of >700 days. No deaths or unanticipated adverse device effects occurred at any point during the trial. Overall, adverse events occurred in a similar proportion of patients in both arms during the controlled period (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 11). Nonserious related adverse events were predominantly associated with the implantation procedure (Supplementary Table 13), reported in 38 patients (15.6%; 52 events). These were consistent with those seen in other devices implanted near the cervical vagus nerve. The most frequent events were mild to moderate hoarseness, classified as either vocal cord paresis (4.5%, n = 11) or dysphonia (2.9%, n = 7). These adverse events resolved over the course of up to one year; three patients received bulk injection fillers into the left vocal cord and some underwent voice therapy. No cases required surgical intervention. Additional implantation-related adverse events of mild to moderate severity occurred in 5.4% of patients related to the surgical site (n = 13), including swelling/inflammation (n = 6), hypoesthesia (n = 2), stitch abscess/infection (n = 2), pain (n = 1), erythema (n = 1) and a suture-related complication (n = 1). Active stimulation (1 min daily) was generally well tolerated. Mild to moderate stimulation-related events, most commonly pain, occurred in 4.2% of patients (n = 10) during the controlled period and 4.6% (n = 11) during long-term follow-up. These typically resolved after reducing stimulation strength or adjusting the time of delivery, without interruption of therapy.

Overall, during the controlled period and long-term follow-up, 4 of 242 ITT patients (1.7%) experienced a serious adverse event related to surgical procedure, all having an onset during the perioperative period (1.6% of the 243 enrolled patients in the safety population). All these events resolved without clinically significant sequelae. There was one event of postoperative incision-site swelling, one event of transient vocal cord paresis (presented as hoarseness) with dysphagia, one intraoperative pharyngeal perforation (that occurred during an explantation procedure and was immediately repaired) and one event of postoperative dysphonia (that presented as hoarseness) possibly associated with postoperative progression of age-related vocal cord bowing (presbylarynges; Table 2). There were no serious adverse events related to the active stimulation.

A total of six patients underwent device removal (explantation) before 12 months. All explantations were performed as outpatient, elective procedures. The reasons for explantation included a nonfunctioning device (n = 1), chronic pain at the incision site (n = 1), gastrointestinal symptoms attributed to stimulation therapy (n = 1) and patients who requested removal due to perceived lack of benefit (n = 3). During the explantation procedure, the vagus nerve appeared to be normal on visual inspection.

Details of the safety results during the open-label stimulation period are provided in Table 2 and Supplementary Tables 17–21. No safety concerns have been identified through other protocolized safety monitoring assessments (for example, vital signs, hematology, ECG, blood pressure, heart rate). All adverse events of infection, major adverse cardiac events and malignancies were reviewed and determined to be unrelated, and the rates were within the expected range for the target RA patient population.

RESET-RA is the first randomized, sham-controlled trial to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a neuroimmune modulation device to treat any autoimmune disease, specifically RA. Compliance with therapy and preservation of treatment blinding were achieved through automated nighttime delivery of active stimulation. Efficacy was observed in the 3-month blinded-control period and further supported by improvement during the open-label stimulation period through 12 months, with low usage of adjunctive b/tsDMARDs. In patients with high baseline risk for structural damage, active stimulation substantially reduced progression of bone erosions, as assessed by quantitative MRI joint imaging.

The enrolled study population reflected a spectrum of treatment experiences, including 43% classified with ‘difficult-to-treat' (D2T) RA, that is, those who had previously failed multiple b/tsDMARDs, with at least 2 different mechanisms of action19, and 39% who had failed a single b/tsDMARD. The patient's choice to undergo surgical implantation of an experimental device rather than switch to another b/tsDMARD indicated strong patient preference for nonpharmacologic treatment options. Unlike most trials for new therapies in this population, RESET-RA did not impose a requirement for elevated CRP at baseline, allowing inclusion of patients with moderate-to-severe RA regardless of CRP status who would normally be excluded from studies of new RA therapies. This inclusive design reflects the broader United States (US) RA population, where CRP is not uniformly elevated despite active disease20.

Efficacy measures were consistent with those used in phase 3 RA drug trials. Rates of ACR20 response, EULAR moderate/good response and LDA/remission by DAS28-CRP criteria were all higher with stimulation compared with sham at 3 months (LDA/remission by CDAI was numerically higher). Blinding across all assessed parties was satisfactory at the primary clinical end point, and the sham response rate was consistent with placebo response rates reported in phase 3 trials of pharmacologic therapies in bDMARD-refractory patients21,22,23,24. During the open-label period, therapeutic responses in arm 1 continued to improve over time, while patients in arm 2 demonstrated clinical benefits following crossover to active stimulation. The observed clinical improvement past 3 months was consistent with the pilot study of this neuromodulation system in patients with RA12,14. In both arms, the ACR20, clinical LDA/remission and EULAR good/moderate response rates were comparable to those achieved with effective pharmacologic therapies in similar bDMARD-refractory patients by 6 months, and were sustained through 12 months21,22,23,24.

Protection from progressive structural damage was documented by MRI. Although most patients who have had an inadequate response to b/tsDMARD therapy were unlikely to have had MRI-observable erosive progression over a 3-month period (as was observed in the ITT population), the subgroup with elevated synovitis and/or osteitis at baseline was at higher risk for progression25. In this higher erosive-risk phenotype, active stimulation attenuated the rate of erosion progression, a clinically relevant effect, given that progressive MRI-detectable erosions at 3 months predict radiographic progression at 12 months and subsequent functional decline26,27.

The observed protection from bone erosions is consistent with several known mechanisms of vagus nerve-targeted neuroimmune modulation. For example, vagotomized mice become osteoporotic, while stimulating the vagus nerve leads to increased bone formation12,28,29,30. Electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve induces release of specialized pro-resolving mediators and neurotransmitters that signal through specific receptors including the ChemR23 lipid receptors, acetylcholine receptors and adrenergic receptors on osteoblasts, osteoclasts and osteocytes resulting in reduction of osteoclastogenesis and osteoclastic activity28,30,31,32,33,34,35. The protective effect of this therapy on bone may therefore be mediated by the canonical RANKL/osteoprotegerin pathway (neuroimmune modulation decreases RANKL and increases osteoprotegerin, the decoy ligand for RANKL) as well as direct effects on osteoblasts, osteoclasts and osteocytes28,30,31,32,33,34,35. While these pathways are biologically plausible, confirmation in RA patients will require future targeted mechanistic studies.

In evaluating the safety of drugs used to treat RA, there has been a critical focus on increased rates of serious infections, major cardiovascular, venous and/or arterial thrombotic events and malignancies, reflecting the immunosuppressive mechanisms of action of b/tsDMARDs36. The safety data from the RESET-RA trial through 12 months showed no increase in these adverse events, consistent with the well-established safety data of vagus nerve stimulation accumulated over decades of use in nonautoimmune disease populations37. No hemodynamic changes, including hypotension or bradycardia, were detected during the study. The rate of related serious adverse events was low, associated with the surgery, all of which were successfully managed to clinical resolution, and with no events observed in the open-label period. Nonserious adverse events were predominantly associated with the implantation procedure, were mild or moderate in severity and consistent with the inherent risks of any surgical procedure performed near the cervical vagus nerve37. Discomfort related to stimulation was typically managed by reducing the stimulation without discontinuing therapy. Clinical application of electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve with a variety of devices has been used in the U.S. since 1997, initially as an adjunctive treatment for patients with drug-refractory epilepsy, later for difficult-to-treat depression, and most recently for use in stroke patients to improve motor function when paired with physical rehabilitation37. Relative to this extensive prior clinical experience, no new risks or safety signals were observed in the RESET-RA trial.

The new integrated neuromodulation system used in the RESET-RA trial represents an important advancement in device design, as it uses a rechargeable battery and integrated electrodes, obviating the need to tunnel a lead wire from an implantable pulse generator, typically placed in the chest, to the cervical vagus nerve. This design eliminates the risk of lead breakage and chest-pocket infections seen with other systems. Nonimplanted devices could also mitigate these risks; however, to date, randomized controlled trials of transcutaneous stimulation targeting neuroimmune pathways have not demonstrated efficacy in RA38.

A limitation of this trial was the 3-month controlled phase, which was restricted in duration by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines to protect patients randomized to placebo from an extended period without treatment. In drug trials, peak ACR20 responses are typically observed by 3 months, that is, continued group-level improvement after 3 months is minimal21,22,23,24. In contrast, stimulation in arm 1 appears to take longer to reach peak therapeutic response. The response is consistent with clinical experience with vagus nerve stimulation for other indications, where some patients took longer to achieve threshold benefit37. The extended time to peak therapeutic response is likely influenced by modulation of innate neuroimmune pathways rather than by acute inhibition of discrete inflammatory pathways, the mechanism of most pharmaceutical interventions. This may explain why, despite a statistically significant difference in ACR20 response rates between arms at 3 months (meeting the primary efficacy end point), the effect size of 11.8% was smaller than the projected effect size of 25% and smaller than that typically reported in drug trials at 3 months21,22,23,24. During open-label, the therapeutic response to active stimulation increased between 3 and 6 months, as was first observed in the pilot study of this neuromodulation system12,14. In addition, the consistency of clinical outcomes across multiple visits through 12 months in the open-label period, together with a low rate of drug augmentation, supports the durability of the treatment effect. Demonstrating longer-term sustained reductions in disease activity (beyond short-term efficacy measured at 3 months) is clinically meaningful, as RA is a chronic disease that requires prolonged therapy. Caution should be exercised in interpreting the low rate of augmentation therapy, as observed disease activity after 3 months to 12 months was not paired against protocol-mandated decision-making to either advance or not advance therapy.

In conclusion, evidence from this large, pivotal, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial of an integrated neuromodulation system using an implantable device demonstrated significant sustained clinical benefits and high patient satisfaction with low rates of adverse events through 12 months of follow-up in a largely D2T, moderately-to-severely active RA population. Patients benefited from automatic delivery of 1 min of active treatment daily to achieve substantial improvement in their disease activity, resulting in a significant decrease in swollen and tender joints, and reduction in MRI-observed erosions without the use of b/tsDMARDs. Vagus nerve-mediated neuroimmune modulation offers a first-in-class nonpharmacologic therapeutic option for RA.

The RESET-RA trial (ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT04539964, registered on 31 August 2020) was a pivotal, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial conducted at 41 sites across the U.S. based on study design considerations from the FDA previously used to approve therapeutic trials for RA39,40. Within 30 days of completing the baseline assessments performed at time of informed consent, all eligible patients who provided informed consent underwent an outpatient surgical procedure to implant the integrated vagus nerve stimulation device, followed by randomization (day 0) in a 1:1 ratio to either an active stimulation (arm 1) or a sham stimulation (arm 2) group. Randomization incorporated stratification for prior inadequate or lost response to a tsDMARD, exposure to ≥4 biological DMARDs with ≥2 mechanisms of action and RA disease severity at day 0. The randomization scheme was generated by the study biostatisticians and implemented centrally through Interactive Response Technology (IRT). End points were assessed at 3 months after randomization as change from baseline. Blinding was formally assessed using Bang's blinding index41,42. Data collection used the Veeva System of Electronic Data Capture, with clinical sites directly entering data through a password-protected portal, with source documentation verification completed by clinical monitors. Data collection by Electronic Data Capture was compliant for data integrity, security and traceability through adherence to regulations like FDA 21 CFR Part 11 and ICH GCP, and global standards.

After the primary end point assessment at 3 months, all patients were eligible for open-label treatment with stimulation, and use of adjunctive pharmacological treatments were permitted at the discretion of the rheumatologist in consultation with the patient (‘augmented therapy'). Augmented therapy was defined as initiation of a b/tsDMARD, use of additional csDMARD(s), high-dose steroids or steroid injections in combination with continued active stimulation during open-label follow-up. Results are reported through 12 months. A detailed schematic of trial design and visits is provided in Extended Data Fig. 1. All data and results associated with the dataset are available in the ‘Results' section and Supplementary Note.

All patients provided written informed consent using an institutional review board (IRB)-approved document. Patients were compensated with a nominal payment, approved by the IRB, for each completed visit. The study only reported sex as self-reported by the study participant.

Eligible patients were adults (age = 22–75 years, inclusive) with moderately-to-severely active RA defined at baseline (day of informed consent) by the presence of >4 tender joints and >4 swollen joints of 28 joints, as assessed by a designated joint evaluator. Prior treatment with at least one csDMARD (for example, methotrexate) for a minimum of 12 weeks was required at a continuous and nonchanging dose for at least 4 weeks before consent. Patients were required to maintain this csDMARD dose throughout the double-blind, sham-controlled period. Patients were also required to have experienced an inadequate response or intolerance to at least one or more b/tsDMARDs before consent, with standard b/tsDMARD washout completed before the surgical procedure for device implantation. An elevated level of an acute phase reactant, such as serum C-reactive protein, was not required for eligibility. Exclusion criteria included history of vagotomy, partial or complete splenectomy, clinically significant cardiovascular disease or regular use of or dependency on nicotine products within the two years preceding study participation. Complete eligibility criteria are provided in the Supplementary Note—Inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Participants meeting final eligibility criteria and in whom the implantation procedure was attempted were considered enrolled (safety cohort). The implantation procedure occurred within 30 days of informed consent and took place in an operating room under general anesthesia. The Implant and Pod were placed on the left cervical vagus nerve by surgeons trained and experienced in procedures involving the implantation of vagus nerve stimulation devices. All surgeons performing the implant procedure had documented training before performing the first case. All enrolled and randomized patients were included in the ITT analysis.

Stimulation therapy was delivered by a neuromodulation device comprised of an implant with an integrated, rechargeable battery approximately 2.5 cm in length. The implant was placed in a silicon positioning pod on the left cervical vagus nerve during an outpatient surgical procedure under general anesthesia (Fig. 2). The surgical procedure to implant the device has been previously described15. The entire system also included external devices for recharging and programming the implant. Stimulation parameters chosen for this study have been designed, translated and validated in 3 prior clinical studies12,13,16,43.

All patients, regardless of treatment assignment, completed the same stimulation titration protocol that occurred weekly over a period of 4 weeks. The device was titrated to an upper comfort level that did not exceed 2.5 mA. For treatment, a pulse train was delivered to the vagus nerve for 1 min once daily at 10 Hz (stimulation group), while patients randomized to sham stimulation always received 0 mA, regardless of the stimulation strength set by the blinded programmer. Stimulation was programmed to be delivered in the early morning hours, when patients would typically be asleep. Patients were instructed that feeling stimulation was not necessary to be receiving active treatment, and if stimulation was felt, the stimulation setting may not be at a therapeutic dose during the double-blind, sham-controlled period. Blinding to group assignment was maintained for patients, healthcare providers, investigators, joint evaluators and the sponsor until all patients completed assessments at 3 months and the database was locked for primary efficacy analysis. Because all patients crossed over to open-label follow-up before the study was unblinded, they repeated the initial titration protocol, as it was unknown whether they had been receiving stimulation or sham during the 3-month double-blind period.

The primary end point was the difference in proportion of patients receiving stimulation versus sham who achieved an ACR20 response at the 3-month visit from baseline (day of consent). ACR20 response is a dichotomous composite end point indicating the proportion of patients that achieve at least 20% improvement in the number of both tender and swollen joints of a maximum of 28 joints and ≥3 of 5 additional measures—HAQ-DI score (scale 0 = mild disability to 3 = severe disability), patient global assessment of disease (0 = inactive to 10 = very active, patient pain (0 = no pain to 10 = worst), evaluator's global assessment of disease (0 = inactive to 10 = very active) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentration (mg ml−1)17. Additional prespecified end points included DAS28-CRP good/moderate response according to the EULAR criteria, achievement of low disease activity (LDA) or remission by DAS28-CRP criteria (DAS28-CRP, score < 3.2 for LDA or remission) and LDA or remission by the CDAI (score <10 for LDA or remission). Additional outcomes were collected that were not the focus of this study and may be the topic of subsequent publications. Detailed descriptions of end points can be found in the Supplementary Note—Description of efficacy end points.

To objectively evaluate treatment effect on joint inflammation and erosions, a standardized, validated imaging method, using gadolinium contrast-enhanced MRI of the hand and wrist, was used. Images were obtained at the following timepoints: before the implant procedure, 3 months, and 6 months. The OMERACT RAMRIS was used to evaluate progression of bone erosions18. All images were assessed centrally by two independent radiologists blinded to treatment allocation, clinical information and the order in which the images were acquired to ensure objective and unbiased scoring. Prespecified analyses included the percentage of patients exhibiting progression in bone erosions (increase in score > 0.5 at 3 months compared to first MRI) among patients with a highly erosive phenotype (defined as synovitis score of 2 or more on any individual joint, at least four joints with a score of 1 or any joint with osteitis at baseline)25,44.

To evaluate reported satisfaction with the therapy, a participant satisfaction questionnaire, administered at 6 months, was comprised of five-point Likert rating scale and question on whether the participant would recommend the SetPoint System. An optional section was available for the participant to provide comments. This was an exploratory end point and there were no prespecified analyses.

Adverse events and serious adverse events were tabulated and coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (version 23.1) and the incidence of events was tabulated based on system organ class and preferred term. All enrolled patients were analyzed for safety. Adverse events were evaluated by investigators for relatedness to the implant device, implantation procedure, charger, stimulation therapy or explantation procedure (if completed). Safety was also monitored by clinical laboratory tests, including complete blood count, measurement of vital signs, electrocardiogram and other safety assessments performed at baseline and scheduled visits.

An investigational device exemption was approved by the FDA, and the trial was conducted in accordance with national and local regulations, the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The protocol was approved by an institutional review board at each participating site. All patients provided written informed consent before undergoing study-related activities. An independent data safety and monitoring committee oversaw the study conduct. The sponsor (SetPoint Medical) and a subset of authors designed the study. The data were collected by the investigators and their study teams. Data was analyzed by the sponsor's biostatistician and interpreted by the sponsor and authors. All the authors reviewed and approved the paper and had access to the data. The authors vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. Advarra served as the central IRB, with three sites using local IRBs.

Power calculations were performed solely for the primary end point. A sample size of 120 per study group would provide 91.6% power to detect a 25% difference in ACR20 response at 3 months, with one-sided α of 0.025, assuming response rates of 45% and 20% in the stimulation and sham groups, respectively. Patients who were enrolled and randomized were analyzed as ITT for the primary outcome.

Data analyses were performed as open-label populations at 6 months, 9 months and 12 months, with all patients receiving stimulation. These analyses were performed as an all-completers analysis (all patients who completed the specified follow-up visit) and a nonaugmented analysis (all patients who completed the visit without use of augmented therapy).

Binary responses, including the ACR20 response at 3 months, were analyzed with the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test using stratification factors based on prespecified criteria (prior inadequate or lost response to a tsDMARD, prior inadequate or lost response to ≥4 biological DMARDs with ≥2 mechanisms of action and RA disease severity defined as either <4 TJC28 or <4 SJC28 at day 0). The secondary efficacy end points that were continuous variables (change from baseline) were analyzed using mixed-effect model repeated measure statistics. Among the key secondary end points, multiplicity adjustment using Hochberg's step-up procedure was performed to control the familywise type 1 error rate at a one-sided significance level of 0.025 (ref. 45).

Assessment of LDA or remission were evaluated by DAS28-CRP (score < 3.2) and CDAI (score < 10) as prespecified exploratory end points. The Bang's blinding index and its associated 95% CIs were calculated for patients, investigators and joint evaluators (scale range = −1 to 1 with │scores│ < 0.3 considered as satisfactory blinding)41. All analyses were conducted with SAS software (version 9.4, SAS Institute).

Given that the primary efficacy end point of ACR20 response was composed of seven components, missing data were handled as follows: if either tender-joint count or swollen-joint count were missing, or if ≥3 of 5 remaining ACR measures were missing, the participant was considered as a nonresponder. For binary secondary end points, participants with missing efficacy data, early withdrawals (before 3 months) or participants who received rescue treatment before 3 months were imputed as nonresponders. Rescue treatment was defined as any change in RA treatment made before 3 months for the reason of addressing worsening of RA symptoms by adding a b/tsDMARD, increasing the dose or adding a csDMARD, increasing the dose or adding a corticosteroid or a corticosteroid injection within 30 days of a study visit. For continuous end points, the change from baseline was set to missing at visits with missing postbaseline values, where data were imputed to missing, or for patients who received rescue treatment before 3 months.

Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) can produce important one-carbon (C1) feedstocks for sustainable biomanufacturing, such as formate. Unfortunately, natural formate assimilation pathways are inefficient and constrained to organisms that are difficult to engineer. Here we establish a synthetic reductive formate pathway (ReForm) in vitro. ReForm is a six-step pathway consisting of five engineered enzymes catalyzing nonnatural reactions to convert formate into the universal biological building block acetyl-CoA. We establish ReForm by selecting enzymes among 66 candidates from prokaryotic and eukaryotic origins. Through iterative cycles of engineering, we create and evaluate 3,173 sequence-defined enzyme mutants, tune cofactor concentrations and adjust enzyme loadings to increase pathway activity toward the model end product malate. We demonstrate that ReForm can accept diverse C1 substrates, including formaldehyde, methanol and formate produced from the electrochemical reduction of CO2. Our work expands the repertoire of synthetic C1 utilization pathways, with implications for synthetic biology and the development of a formate-based bioeconomy.

Identity-specific chromosome conformation must be re-established at each cell division. To uncover how interphase folding is inherited, we developed an approach that segregates chromosome-intrinsic mechanisms from those propagated through the cytoplasm during G1 nuclear reassembly. Inducible degradation of proteins essential for the establishment of nucleocytoplasmic transport during mitotic exit enabled analysis of folding programmes with distinct modes of inheritance. Here we show that genome compartmentalization is driven entirely by chromosome-intrinsic factors. In addition to conventional compartmental segregation, the chromosome-intrinsic folding programme leads to prominent genome-scale microcompartmentalization of mitotically bookmarked cis-regulatory elements. The microcompartment conformation forms transiently during telophase and is subsequently modulated by a second folding programme inherited through the cytoplasm in early G1. This programme includes cohesin-mediated loop extrusion and factors involved in transcription and RNA processing. The combined and interdependent action of chromosome-intrinsic and cytoplasmic inherited folding programmes determines the interphase chromatin conformation as cells exit mitosis.

Interphase chromosome folding is specific to the transcriptional programme of a given cell type1,2,3,4. Two major processes contribute to this folding: loop extrusion mediated by cohesin and spatial compartmentalization that is probably driven by homotypic affinities of chromatin domains distributed across the genome5. Within the three-dimensional (3D) space of the nucleus the genome is segregated into broad euchromatin/heterochromatin compartments and multiple constituent subcompartments that form within (in cis) and between (in trans) chromosomes6. Heterochromatic loci cluster together, often at the nuclear periphery, and active chromatin domains self-associate most frequently in the nuclear interior. The molecular factors that determine compartmentalization remain poorly understood7,8. The distribution of histone modifications along the genome is strongly correlated with subcompartment formation6,9,10 and it is possible that these modifications display homotypic affinities (that is, histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation, H3K9me3; ref. 11). In addition, factors that bind at specific histone modifications—that is, BRD proteins for histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac)11,12 and HP1 proteins for H3K9me3 (refs. 13,14)—can bridge interactions between marked loci. As gene expression is cell type-specific, changes in chromatin composition and histone modification along the linear genome and, in turn, the spatial positioning of these domains in subcompartments within the nucleus also differ between cell types.

Interphase chromosome folding is actively modulated by cohesin-dependent loop formation. The resulting interaction patterns are also cell type-specific due to the reliance of cohesin activity on the positioning of cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Cohesin can be loaded throughout the genome15 but is more efficiently recruited at open chromatin sites such as enhancers16,17,18. Furthermore, loop extrusion is blocked in a directional manner at CTCF-bound sites9,19,20,21 and cohesin complexes are unloaded near the 3′ ends of active genes16,22. These dynamics specify a genome-wide ‘cohesin traffic pattern' that gives rise to a complex identity-specific chromosome folding pattern observed by the chromosome conformation capture-based technology Hi-C that includes loops (for example, CTCF–CTCF and promoter-enhancer loops), stripes, flares, insulated boundaries and topologically associating domains (TADs)23.

During mitosis most features of cell type-specific chromosome folding, such as compartments and cohesin-mediated loops, are undetectable by Hi-C. A largely cell type-invariant compressed array of partially self-entangled loops is instead formed by condensin complexes to give rise to rod-shaped mitotic chromatids24,25,26,27,28. These loops are not positioned at specific CREs. Many of the chromatin-associated factors that contribute to interphase organization are absent from mitotic chromosomes. Condensins actively remove loop-extruding cohesin complexes during prophase of mitosis26, and cell-cycle kinases drive the phosphorylation and dissociation of a large proportion of the chromatin-bound factors, including CTCF, transcription factors and, to a large extent, RNA polymerases29,30,31,32,33. However, not all regulatory factors dissociate from mitotic chromosomes and a number remain bound at specific cis-elements. This phenomenon, referred to as mitotic bookmarking34, records active loci for reactivation in the next cell cycle. Cell cycle stage-dependent changes in chromosome structure are also observed at the scale of nucleosomes. Although promoters that are active in a given cell type remain largely nucleosome-free, enhancers are less accessible during mitosis and are probably bookmarked to be reopened by remodellers during the next cell cycle29,35. Similarly, CTCF sites are thought to be bookmarked by active histone modifications and become occupied by nucleosomes in mitosis, although the extent to which this occurs differs between cell types29,36,37.

The dramatic changes to chromosome organization that occur during mitosis pose a particular challenge to cycling cells. Every time cells re-enter G1, the cell type-invariant mitotic chromosome structure must be converted to an identity-specific interphase conformation. The relative timing of events during this process has been delineated in several recent studies38,39,40,41,42. First, condensins dissociate during telophase and a transient chromosome folding state devoid of extruded loops is formed39. Although CTCF is rapidly enriched at post-mitotic chromatin, the cohesin complex is recruited later during cytokinesis38,39, at which point extrusion rapidly re-establishes loops, TADs and other extrusion-related features. Genome compartmentalization is first detected around telophase but does not reach the full extent of segregation until well into G1 (ref. 39).

Although the kinetics of post-mitotic chromosome reorganization are increasingly known, it remains unclear how the cell type-specific folding programme is transmitted through mitosis. We have established an experimental system that allows us to discriminate the contributions of factors required for cell identity-specific chromosome folding based on whether they are inherited on mitotic chromosomes or transmitted to daughter nuclei through the cytoplasm. We find that the interphase chromatin state is achieved through the combined action of two folding programmes inherited in distinct ways.

During telophase, the nuclear envelope re-forms around newly segregated chromosomes, establishing regulated nucleocytoplasmic transport. We sought to prevent nuclear import from telophase onwards to understand the extent to which type-specific interphase chromosome folding can be re-established independently of G1 cytoplasmic factors. To this end, RanGAP1 and Nup93 were biallelically fused with auxin-inducible degron (AID) and NeonGreen fluorescent protein sequences in DLD-1 cells using CRISPR–Cas9 (Methods, Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1), enabling disruption of nuclear transport by two mechanisms. Nup93 is a scaffold nucleoporin essential for assembly and stability of nuclear pore complexes43,44,45, and RanGAP1 critically regulates the RanGTP gradient required for nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of proteins46,47.

To prevent nuclear transport during mitotic exit, RanGAP1–AID or NUP93–AID were degraded in arrested prometaphase cells (Supplementary Methods and Fig. 1a,b). The cells were then released through anaphase into G1. Depletion of RanGAP1–AID or Nup93–AID did not impact the kinetics of the initial mitotic exit stages (Fig. 1c,d and Extended Data Fig. 2a–c). The absence of Nup93 after mitotic release resulted in daughter nuclei sealed by a continuous nuclear envelope and an underlying nuclear lamina devoid of mature nuclear pore complexes (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e). Conversely, apparently mature nuclear pore complexes were found at the nuclear envelope of RanGAP1–AID-depleted cells (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 2e). Despite differences in nuclear morphology, depletion of either RanGAP1–AID or Nup93–AID impeded chromatin decondensation and nuclear volume expansion characteristic of control cells progressing through G1 (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 2d). Nucleoli and nuclear speckles, two import-dependent organelles with important roles in nuclear organization48,49,50,51, were not found in RanGAP1–AID- or Nup93–AID-depleted nuclei and strong speckle protein-containing granules were found exclusively in the cytoplasm (Extended Data Fig. 2f).

The transport competence of Nup93- and RanGAP1-depleted cells for large macromolecules was quantified by expressing a canonical importin-α nuclear localization signal (NLS) fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP) and mScarlet fluorescent protein (MBP–mScarlet–NLS; Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 2g). Time-lapse fluorescence imaging of control cells demonstrated efficient nuclear import of MBP–mScarlet–NLS following chromosome segregation, with minimal protein observed in the cytoplasm by 5 h. In contrast with the untreated controls, depletion of either Nup93–AID or RanGAP1–AID prevented the nuclear accumulation of MBP–mScarlet–NLS throughout mitotic exit and G1 entry entirely, consistent with a failure to establish nucleocytoplasmic transport. Thus, in this experimental context, the genome is isolated from the cytoplasm once the nuclear envelope has formed in late telophase.

To assess how chromosome-intrinsic factors inform post-mitotic genome folding, we performed Hi-C 3.0 (refs. 52,53; Methods and Supplementary Table 1). Pure G1 populations of cells that had progressed through mitosis in the absence or presence of RanGAP1 or Nup93 were obtained by fluorrescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Supplementary Fig. 1). Despite an inability to establish active nucleocytoplasmic transport, not only did broad euchromatin/heterochromatin compartments form but they also seemed more pronounced in RanGAP1–AID- and Nup93–AID-depleted cells (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 2b,c). In the absence of nuclear import, we observed an additional prominent network of small (<100 kb) highly interacting chromatin domains that interacted ubiquitously with each other in cis and trans. The chromosome-wide grid-like nature of these interactions implies the formation of a distinct subcompartment in the absence of factors that would normally enter the nucleus after telophase. We refer to these interactions as microcompartments on the basis of their scale and similarity to previously described structures8,54.

The properties of chromosome-intrinsic microcompartments were explored by identifying the domains of 25–125 kb that mediate strong focal pairwise enrichments in the Hi-C interaction data of RanGAP1–AID-depleted G1 cells. We identified 2,105 strong microcompartment domains (MCDs) along the linear genome encompassing all autosomal chromosomes9,55 (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Methods). Microcompartment domains consist of gene-dense active regions corresponding to high assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC–seq) coverage and peaks of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac found in both control and RanGAP1-depleted cells in G1 (Fig. 2b,c and Supplementary Tables 2,3). Accordingly, active promoters and enhancers defined in control cells (candidate CREs, cCREs; Methods) were highly enriched at MCDs (Fig. 2d). Furthermore, the A-compartment profile at MCDs captured by the first Eigenvector (EV1) in control cells was focally enriched in RanGAP1–AID- and Nup93–AID-depleted cells (Fig. 2a,c and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b), indicating a more prominent subcompartment. We confirmed the compartment nature of these regions by genome-wide spectral clustering analysis of RanGAP1-depletion Hi-C data (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 4a,b)15,56. More than 60% of the 2,105 MCDs were specifically covered by a single cluster corresponding to highly active euchromatin (Extended Data Fig. 4c).

Based on the comprehensive grid of microcompartments observed in RanGAP1–AID-depleted cells, we leveraged the possibility that all MCDs possess an intrinsic affinity for each other. To quantify the strength of these interactions, we projected all pairwise combinations of MCDs, giving rise to 73,970 and 2,079,615 microcompartment interactions within and between chromosomes, respectively. Aggregate pileups demonstrate an average focal enrichment of interaction frequency of at least fourfold in RanGAP1–AID- and Nup93–AID-depleted cells extending to all genomic distances in cis and to trans chromosomal contacts (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 3c). Enriched interactions between the MCDs were also observed in control G1 cells but with substantially reduced frequency (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 3c), consistent with previous observations of weakly enriched interactions between active promoters and enhancers in wild-type cells8,54,57. The quantitatively lower enrichment of MCD contact frequency in Nup93–AID-depleted cells compared with RanGAP1 depletion may reflect clonal variation, as MCDs were assigned in the latter context, but we also noted marked differences in the short-range contact frequency heat maps of Nup93-depleted cells, including a more prominent maintenance of some control loops compared with the RanGAP1 depletion (Extended Data Fig. 3a).

In a complementary analysis we determined the interaction frequencies between cCREs defined in control RanGAP1–AID cells. Pairs of CTCF sites interacted frequently in control cells at genomic distances of <1 megabases (Mb), as expected, but were dramatically reduced in RanGAP1–AID- or Nup93–AID-depleted G1 cells (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 3d). Conversely, we found that active promoters and enhancers interacted with each other at considerably elevated frequencies regardless of genomic separation when nuclei formed in the absence of RanGAP1 or Nup93 (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 3d). These interactions also occurred in control cells but at lower frequencies. Together, we found that the propensity to form a distinct microcompartment of active CREs during G1 is an intrinsic capacity of post-mitotic chromosomes that emerges as a pronounced feature in the absence of active nuclear transport.

Telophase is the last mitotic stage when chromosomes can recruit cytoplasmic factors independently of nuclear import. We therefore sought to determine the folding state of telophase chromosomes using Hi-C. Pro-metaphase-arrested control and RanGAP1–AID-depleted cells were released and fixed after 1.25 or 1.50 h, the point where we observed the greatest proportion of telophase cells in the post-mitotic population (Fig. 1d, upper right quadrant), and stained with propidium iodide (PI). To enrich telophase populations, the cells were sorted based on the intensity and width of the PI signal (Fig. 3a), which briefly peaks in the transition from metaphase to G1 (ref. 58; Fig. 1c). At 1.25 h post release, at least 60% of the sorted cells were in telophase, as evidenced by elongated mid-body microtubules connecting the two masses of highly condensed chromosomes (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Cells sorted in the same way at 1.5 h post release had progressed through telophase and we could identify more than half of the sorted cells having a clear abscission mid-body, indicating they were in cytokinesis. In our experimental system, nuclear volume increased by about 50% from telophase to cytokinesis in control cells and dramatically expanded by almost threefold in early G1 (Fig. 3b). In contrast, RanGAP1–AID-depleted nuclei did not noticeably expand in size beyond telophase.

We performed Hi-C with FACS-sorted populations of prometaphase, telophase, cytokinesis and G1 cells, and observed the progressive acquisition of interphase chromosome compartments and loops in control cells (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 5b). Remarkably, unperturbed cells were found to form MCD contacts that were visually apparent in contact frequency heat maps by cytokinesis. We compared the 2,105 MCDs identified in G1 to those identified in cytokinesis-sorted RanGAP1-depleted cells and found that more than half of all G1 MCDs were detected at the earlier time point (Extended Data Fig. 5c). In addition, a substantial number of microcompartment anchors were only called in cytokinesis or only in G1 but aggregate analysis demonstrated their interactions did indeed occur in cis and trans in both cell-cycle stages, albeit with different relative frequencies (Fig. 3d). Pairwise interactions between MCDs identified as cytokinesis-specific, G1-specific or shared cytokinesis-G1 were formed in cis and trans during telophase and increased in strength towards cytokinesis in both control and RanGAP1–AID-depleted cells (Fig. 3d). In the absence of nuclear import, these active microcompartments continued to strengthen as cells entered G1. By contrast, progression into G1 in control cells coincided with a strong reduction in the frequency of pairwise MCD interactions. Together, these data demonstrate that extensive cis and trans microcompartmentalization of active cCREs is a normal transient process that peaks during cytokinesis and is then lost or at least severely reduced during G1. Similar short-range microcompartment dynamics have been seen during mitotic exit in mouse cells59. This loss was not observed in RanGAP1–AID- or Nup93–AID-depleted cells and MCD interactions continued to increase in frequency as cells progressed through G1.

The MCDs detected during cytokinesis were relatively enriched for marks of active CREs compared with those detected later in G1 (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 5d). Although cytokinesis-specific MCDs displayed slightly different interaction dynamics during the time course, they were similarly enriched for active CREs. Accordingly, contacts between active promoters and enhancers mirrored the interactions between MCDs during mitotic exit (Extended Data Fig. 5e). The average contact frequency between CREs increased in telophase, reaching a peak at all length scales during cytokinesis, and was relatively diminished in a distance-dependent way in control cells by early G1.

As mitotic exit coincides with transcriptional reactivation60,61, we sought to examine the relationship between transcriptional activity and microcompartment formation in control and RanGAP1-depleted cells. We used Thiol(SH)-linked alkylation for the metabolic sequencing of RNA (SLAM–seq)62,63 to directly quantify nascent RNA molecules synthesized in 1-h increments from prometaphase to early G1 (Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 6a,b and Methods). We found that the new-to-total RNA ratios (NTRs) increased relative to prometaphase levels from 2 to 5 h in control cells but globally plateaued after the initial minor increase of nascent synthesis, 2 h following prometaphase release, in RanGAP1-depleted cells (Fig. 4b,c and Extended Data Fig. 6b,c).

a, Workflow for pulse labelling of nascent transcripts during prometaphase or mitotic release in the presence or absence of RanGAP1. Nascent transcripts were labelled by the addition of 4-thio-uridine (4sU) for 1 h before RNA extraction at prometaphase (t = 0) and 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 h after release. The addition of auxin leads to thiol-specific alkylation and enables site-specific substitution of a guanine. SLAM–seq identifies T-to-C conversions by high-throughput sequencing and enables the quantification of nascent and previously transcribed RNA pools. b, Coverage tracks of 4SU-converted reads in control and RanGAP1-depleted cells collected hourly following mitotic release normalized to the prometaphase (t = 0)-arrested signal demonstrating attenuated post-mitotic transcription in RanGAP1-depleted cells. c, Global distribution of the mean of the NTR ratio relative to time 0 (prometaphase-arrested) of control and RanGAP1-depleted samples. Substantial transcriptional activity starting 2 h after mitotic release that continues to increase into G1 characterizes genes in control samples but is attenuated in the absence of RanGAP1. Boxplots indicate the median and interquartile range (box bounds) of the NTR fold changes for three independent SLAM–seq libraries per time point. d, Heat maps of the mean NTRs for genes classified by the temporal stage at which NTR ≥ 10% (n = 9,486 control (left) and 2,872 RanGAP1-depleted (right) genes): prometaphase, 0 h (mito); early, 1–2 h and late, 3–5 h.

Three clusters of genes were defined by the time at which post-mitotic nascent RNA synthesis first exceeded an NTR of 10%: prometaphase (t = 0), early (t = 1–2 h), and late (t = 3–5 h) genes. In control cells, nascent RNA synthesis increased over time through waves of gene activation with earlier expressed genes generally reaching higher relative levels of new transcription by G1 (Fig. 4d (left)). In RanGAP1-depleted cells, these genes displayed reduced transcriptional activation during mitotic exit and generally reduced nascent synthesis (Extended Data Fig. 6d). The relatively few genes with substantial levels of nascent synthesis in RanGAP1-depleted cells were predominantly early expressed genes that were transcribed at reduced levels by G1 (Fig. 4d (right)), consistent with a minimal capacity for new transcription during the early stages of mitotic exit that is severely attenuated by G1. Prometaphase and early expressed genes were significantly enriched at MCDs, particularly those detected in cytokinesis (Fig. 4e). However, this association was found for early expressed control genes but not the RanGAP1-depleted set (Fig. 4e), suggesting a greater correspondence of MCDs to the control transcriptional programme inherited from the previous cell cycle. The global reduction in nascent RNA synthesis in RanGAP1-depleted cells indicates that ongoing transcription is not required to maintain or strengthen these interactions in G1. However, the enrichment of early expressed genes at strong MCDs, implies a role for the microcompartmentalization of active elements in driving post-mitotic gene activation in control cells.

The appearance of a microcompartment during telophase that overlaps the specific active CREs of wild-type cells implies an inherited feature. To investigate this possibility, we performed Omni-ATAC–seq64 (Methods) and cleavage under targets and release using nuclease (CUT&RUN)65 targeting H3K4me3, H3K27ac or CTCF for cells arrested in prometaphase or released to early G1 (Fig. 5a). Consistent with previous work29, the ATAC–seq fragment-length distributions indicated more regularly spaced nucleosomes during mitosis compared with G1 cells, which was not impacted by the depletion of RanGAP1 (Extended Data Fig. 7a). We identified 159,072 peaks of ATAC–seq coverage across all conditions and compared their intersection (Fig. 5b). Although the largest fraction of peaks found genome-wide were G1-specific (left), accessible regions at MCDs were predominantly mitotically retained and RanGAP1 independent (right). These peaks correspond to highly accessible H3K4me3- and H3K27ac-dense loci (Fig. 5a,c), consistent with mitotic bookmarking at CREs. More than 90% of the MCDs overlapped at least one bookmarked promoter- or enhancer-annotated ATAC–seq peak and the valency of these transcriptional elements was increased at the stronger domains that were detected in cytokinesis (Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 7b). A small subset of G1-specific peaks that became accessible in the import-deficient G1 cells were also enriched at MCDs. However, more than half of the MCDs did not overlap any promoter or enhancer specific to these G1-specific peaks, suggesting that the G1-acquired open sites are not essential for MCD interactions (Extended Data Fig. 7c). Together, these data suggest that the microcompartments formed during telophase are driven by mitotically inherited regions of robust chromatin accessibility.

Histone H3K27 acetylation is implicated in both post-mitotic gene activation40,41,61,66 and 3D genome organization8,57. We observed that bookmarked peaks of enriched H3K27ac not only corresponded to MCDs but could also recapitulate microcompartment dynamics during mitotic exit, forming enriched contacts in cis and trans that increased from telophase to cytokinesis and were attenuated as cells entered G1 in the presence of RanGAP1 (Extended Data Fig. 7d,e). These observations are consistent with a capacity for chromatin readers, such as Bromo and Extra-Terminal (BET) domain proteins, to bind acetylated histones during mitosis12,66,67 and form phase-separated condensates11,68,69,70. To determine whether they mediate microcompartment formation during mitotic exit, BET domain proteins were targeted using the competitive inhibitor JQ1 or dBET6 (a proteolysis targeting chimaera, PROTAC), which degrades BRD2 and BRD4 in prometaphase-arrested cells (Fig. 5e). Surprisingly, inhibition or loss of BET domain proteins did not attenuate pairwise interaction frequencies between MCDs or bookmarked H3K27ac peaks in control or RanGAP1-depleted cells during mitotic exit (Fig. 5f and Extended Data Fig. 7f), indicating that another factor or H3K27ac itself must drive the transient clustering of MCDs.

The condensin-mediated loop array that compacts mitotic chromosomes is replaced by the extrusive activity of cohesin around telophase38,39,42, giving rise to CTCF loops, TADs and insulating domain boundaries. Average Hi-C contact probability plotted as a function of genomic separation, P(s), provides an estimation of extruded loop size at the distance of minimal decay25,71,72,73,74. In control cells, condensin loops of 200–300 kb disappeared at telophase and were undetectable by cytokinesis. Following G1 entry, loops of approximately 100 kb were observed, consistent with cohesin-mediated extrusion (Fig. 6a). In the absence of RanGAP1, the condensin loops were lost with similar kinetics to controls but 100-kb loops were not established and the P(s) curve indicates the absence of any extruded loops from cytokinesis onwards. Accordingly, loops at convergent CTCF motifs first appeared in telophase and strengthened by at least fivefold in early G1 control cells, but these interactions remained rare throughout mitotic exit in the absence of RanGAP1 (Fig. 6b–d). Depletion of Nup93–AID similarly prevented the global establishment of strong interphase loops (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b), suggesting that nuclear import is a general requirement for cohesin-mediated loop extrusion during G1 entry. Immunofluorescence confirms exclusion of the cohesin subunit Rad21 from post-mitotic nuclei assembled in the absence of RanGAP1 or Nup93, whereas CTCF retained access to chromatin in the nucleus (Fig. 6c and Extended Data Fig. 8c). Accumulation of CTCF on the chromatin provides support for previous findings suggesting the rapid recruitment of CTCF following mitotic exit precedes the cohesin-mediated extrusion of interphase loops38.

Loop extrusion counteracts epigenetically defined chromatin compartmentalization72,74,75,76 and we observed a decrease in MCD interaction strength in control cells as the strength of extruded loops increased in G1 (Fig. 6d,e). The reduced average MCD–MCD interaction frequency was driven by long-range interactions >750 kb, beyond the range of most extruded loops (Fig. 6f). To address the relationship between extrusion and the loss of telophase microcompartments as cells enter G1, MCDs were categorized by the presence of a CTCF loop anchor. At 10 kb resolution, extrusion anchors were found at more than 75% of the MCDs (Fig. 6g). The MCD interactions that overlapped at least one CTCF loop anchor were only maintained over shorter distances (<750 kb) from cytokinesis to G1, whereas extrusion-free MCD contacts lacked a distance-dependent loss in contact frequency. These findings imply a role for loop extrusion in modifying the global network of pairwise MCD interactions as cells exit mitosis through a process we refer to as ‘pruning'. Microcompartments that appeared in cytokinesis and coincided with interphase CTCF loops were not only retained but strengthened in control G1 cells (Fig. 6h–j), suggesting that although the initial MCD–MCD interactions are cohesin-independent, cohesin-mediated loop extrusion specifically reinforces these contacts. The fact that cohesin loops are typically less than 1 Mb can explain why only relatively short-range microcompartments are maintained in this manner, whereas longer-range contacts are pruned in G1 (Fig. 6f). As these MCDs become tethered to a small set of nearby MCDs to give rise to interphase extrusion loops, interactions with other more distal MCDs become far less probable.

We further classified microcompartment interactions based on the domain identity of the constituent MCDs. We found the most reduced MCD–MCD interactions in control G1 cells overlap a loop anchor and span distinct looping domains (inter-TAD). Conversely, intra-TAD microcompartments and inter-TAD contacts that did not overlap any CTCF loop anchors were reduced to a much lesser extent as control cells exited mitosis (Fig. 6h–j). Notably, the differences in MCD–MCD interactions with respect to loop extrusion anchors observed 5 h after mitotic release in RanGAP1–AID cells could be recapitulated in Nup93–AID cells, confirming generality in DLD-1 (Extended Data Fig. 8a–d). Together, we find that the extensive indiscriminate cCRE microcompartment formed during mitotic exit is pruned following the establishment of active nucleocytoplasmic transport. We propose that cohesin-mediated loop extrusion, and the resulting TADs and CTCF–CTCF loops, impose constraints on which pairwise MCD–MCD interactions remain and which microcompartments melt into larger subcompartments (Fig. 6k).

To evaluate whether the pruned state can be reversed, we performed Hi-C in cells depleted of RanGAP1 specifically after mitosis by the addition of auxin 3.5 h after prometaphase release (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b). At 3.5 h, loops had formed and MCD interactions were mostly pruned in control cells, whereas RanGAP1-depleted cells lacked extrusion loops and possessed extensive microcompartment interactions (Extended Data Fig. 9c). RanGAP1 loss after early G1 leads to a modest gain of long-range contacts between MCDs that are infrequent in control cells and indicates the capacity to re-form MCD contacts after pruning has occurred. This gain in MCD interactions coincided with reduced nuclear localization of cohesin (Extended Data Fig. 9d), suggesting that continuous active nuclear transport is required to maintain nuclear cohesin levels and the fully pruned microcompartment. The relatively minor impact of G1 RanGAP1 depletion could be explained by retained levels of nuclear cohesin. Degradation of RanGAP1 during G1 most closely resembled the early G1 (3.5 h) control condition (Supplementary Fig. 2c,d). This state is characterized by an increase in the size of cohesin-extruded loops (Extended Data Fig. 9e, vertical arrows) and the presence of both MCD–MCD interactions and convergent CTCF loops (Extended Data Fig. 9f,g). Nonetheless, loss of nuclear transport after the occurrence of G1 pruning facilitated an additional increase in average MCD interactions at all genomic distances particularly across looping domains (Extended Data Fig. 9h), indicating a requirement for continuous active nuclear transport to maintain pruning of non-specific MCD interactions and a retained capacity to form these long-range contacts in interphase.

Using EV1 from Eigenvector decomposition of the Hi-C data to define A and B compartments revealed the expected acquisition of homotypic compartmental segregation after mitotic exit in both control and RanGAP1-depleted cells, which increased in strength through telophase, cytokinesis and G1 (Fig. 7a–c). The absence of active nuclear transport as cells progressed to G1 quantitatively impacted active and inactive chromatin compartmentalization (Supplementary Fig. 2c), leading to finer-scale active domains captured by EV1 (Fig. 7a and Extended Data Fig. 10a,b) and enhanced A/B segregation (Fig. 7b and Extended Data Fig. 10c) without global changes to A/B identity (Fig. 7c and Extended Data Fig. 10d). These observations are consistent with previous findings in Nipbl-depleted cells where cohesin-dependent loop extrusion was effectively absent72. The binary classification of active and inactive chromatin from Hi-C data is an oversimplification of genome compartmentalization77 that can be expanded to include cell type-specific subcompartments of different types by various methods9,15,78,79. To further investigate intrinsic compartmentalization, we employed interaction profile groups (IPGs) that were previously defined in wild-type DLD-1 cells80 yielding active (A1 and A2), inactive (pooled to ‘all B') and transcriptionally intermediate (V/VI) chromatin subcompartments. Preferential homotypic interactions between these subcompartment loci increased as cells progressed from cytokinesis to G1 in control and RanGAP1-depleted cells (Fig. 7a,d,e (top)), indicating that compartmentalization at the scale of IPGs is entirely driven by determinants and factors associated with telophase chromosomes.

Source data

Microcompartment domains occurred at similar frequencies at A1 (6.6%), A2 (6.7%) and V/VI (5.9%) IPGs, and were largely absent from the B compartment (0.3%). We found that MCDs interacted most frequently with other MCDs, regardless of their subcompartment status, during cytokinesis (Fig. 7d,e (bottom)). This preference for MCD–MCD interactions was lost in control G1 cells when MCD interaction frequencies reflected the canonical subcompartment interaction affinities. Conversely, the MCD–MCD interactions continued to strengthen during G1 in the absence of RanGAP1, maintaining a strong preference for microcompartmental interactions over contacts with other loci of the same subcompartment type. These data are consistent with the modified spectral clustering performed on RanGAP1-depletion Hi-C data, which demonstrated a distinct interaction profile for MCDs that did not correspond to a single specific IPG defined in wild-type cells (Extended Data Fig. 4). These results demonstrate that the cCRE microcompartment is quantitatively and temporally distinct from subcompartments defined in control G1 cells. In control cells, MCDs initially interacted regardless of subcompartment status but these interactions dissolved (were ‘resorbed') and replaced by interactions with loci, including with loci that were not MCDs, that were generally assigned the same corresponding subcompartment status during mitotic exit. This resorption did not occur in nuclear import-deficient cells for which the cCRE microcompartment continued to strengthen (Fig. 7a, e(arrows) and Extended Data Fig. 10e).

For a better understanding of the chromatin state that gives rise to the cCRE microcompartment and to identify cytoplasmic factors that normally modify this pattern, we employed stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)81, followed by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC–MS) of nuclei isolated from cells exiting mitosis (Fig. 8a). Focusing on common changes to the nuclear proteome between RanGAP1 and Nup93 depletion, we found that universal changes to the protein composition were mostly factors that failed to localize to the nucleus as cells entered G1 (Fig. 8b and Supplementary Tables 4,5). Classification of these proteins according to annotated functions82,83 identified biological processes that were retained or lost in import-deficient nuclei (Fig. 8c). As expected, chromatin-associated processes were enriched in the proteomes of isolated control nuclei. Consistent with our observations of normal mitotic exit kinetics, the absence of active nuclear transport did not consistently impact the presence of factors related to mitotic cell division, including proteins essential to mitotic chromosome condensation (Fig. 8d). We confirmed that the cohesin complex was completely absent in transport-incompetent nuclei. Other strongly depleted processes included DNA replication and repair as well as RNA processing and ribosome biogenesis, the latter being consistent with the absence of nuclear speckles and nucleoli in depleted nuclei (Extended Data Fig. 2e). Proteins involved in DNA-templated transcription were found to require nuclear import for access to the genome in early G1, which was confirmed by a dramatic reduction in components of the basal transcription machinery (Fig. 8d) and cytoplasmic localization of RNA pol II by immunofluorescence (Fig. 8e) in both RanGAP1- and Nup93-depleted cells. Finally, although we found that chromatin organization factors were relatively less consistent between depletions, many chromatin remodelling enzymes were substantially absent from the nucleus in both RanGAP1 and Nup93 depletions, whereas structural components of heterochromatin and euchromatin may be less dependent on transport for nuclear localization in newly divided cells. We conclude that loop extrusion, transcription and RNA processing probably do not occur, or occur to a dramatically reduced degree, in nuclei formed during mitotic exit in the absence of active nuclear transport. Given that canonical chromatin compartments and the cCRE microcompartment form under these conditions, our data suggest that these active processes are mechanistically dispensable for compartmentalization during mitotic exit.

We propose the existence of two folding programmes that specify interphase chromosome conformation as cells exit mitosis and enter G1. The first programme is driven by factors that associate with chromosomes no later than telophase to drive genome-wide compartmentalization based on the epigenetic signatures of the previous cell cycle. This programme includes and may even be driven by mitotically bookmarked cis elements and trans factors that form a prominent indiscriminate cCRE microcompartment starting in telophase. Although inherited in the same way, the cCRE microcompartment is distinct from conventional subcompartments, both in composition and cell cycle-dependent dynamics. A second folding programme starts after nuclear-envelope formation and requires active nucleocytoplasmic transport, implying that the relevant factors are inherited through mitosis in the cytoplasm. This programme includes cohesin, which drives the formation of interphase loops and TADs. It is intriguing that the two main known mechanisms of chromosome folding, compartmentalization and loop extrusion are inherited through mitosis in two distinct and physically segregated ways.

The extensive cCRE microcompartment observed during mitotic exit is a transient folding state that is extensively modulated as cells enter and progress through G1. Microcompartments constitute a discrete compartment type derived from different active subcompartments that display preferential homotypic interactions during cytokinesis and persist into G1 in the absence of nuclear active transport. The cCRE microcompartment, and canonical A and B compartments and subcompartments are all formed without import of factors from the cytoplasm, indicating that affinity-driven compartmentalization is generally mediated by factors stably associated with mitotic chromosomes or rapidly recruited before telophase. Several lines of evidence support the intrinsic inheritance of chromosome compartments. We found that the cCREs at strong MCDs are bookmarked during mitosis. Furthermore, histone modifications associated with active bookmarked loci (for example, H3K4Me3 and H3K72Ac) and more generally corresponding to subcompartments are at least partly retained during mitosis. It is possible that histone modifications are sufficient to mediate affinity-driven compartmentalization, although in vitro studies have suggested that bridging factors, such as BET proteins, mediate interactions between loci marked with acetylated histones11. Previous work has shown that Brd2 and Brd4 contribute to genome compartmentalization during interphase84 and at condensin-depleted mitotic chromosomes85, respectively. However, we found that inhibition or degradation of BRD2 and BRD4 did not impact microcompartment interactions during mitotic exit, which implies an alternative mechanism for microcompartment affinity.

Consistent with previous reports60,61, we observed that a burst of transcription occurs shortly after mitotic exit. The earliest genes expressed following mitotic exit in control cells are preferentially enriched at MCDs compared with genes of the late transcriptional programme, suggesting that microcompartment formation in telophase–cytokinesis could contribute to early post-mitotic gene reactivation. We noted that by G1, when microcompartment interactions are most frequent in RanGAP1-depleted cells, nascent RNA synthesis was strongly attenuated and the transcriptional machinery was excluded from the nucleus. Together, these findings suggest that microcompartment contacts formed during mitotic exit could promote early post-mitotic gene reactivation in control cells but that microcompartment formation itself is independent of transcription. Similarly, compartmentalization has been linked to genome localization at speckles86 and nucleoli87 but the absence of these structures in nuclear transport-deficient cells did not adversely impact any level of global compartmentalization we examined.

We found that a second folding programme is inherited through the cytoplasm at the end of mitosis and thus relies on nuclear transport-dependent factors. Our ATAC–seq data demonstrate that the cell type-specific G1 chromatin landscape relies on chromosome-intrinsic and cytoplasmic factors. Although many cCREs overlapping MCDs remain accessible, bookmarked sites may also be inaccessible during mitosis and require active remodelling during G1 (ref. 29). Accordingly, our proteomics analysis identified a number of import-dependent chromatin remodelling complexes that may contribute to re-establishing the G1-specific architecture. Cohesin can be recruited anywhere along the genome but loop extrusion patterns are sensitive to the presence and location of active cis elements16,22 and transcriptional machinery88. The second folding programme inherited through the cytoplasm may therefore open distal regulatory sites and define a cell type-specific loop-extrusion traffic pattern.

The nuclear import requirement for cohesin accumulation at post-mitotic chromosomes, recently observed by microscopy42, physically and temporally segregates two modes of chromatin extrusion at the end of mitosis, which is consistent with the existence of an extrusion-free chromosome folding intermediate during telophase39. Although the relevance of this separation remains to be seen, it enabled functional segregation of the two main chromatin folding mechanisms in our system.

The chromosome-intrinsic capacity for previously active and mitotically bookmarked promoters and enhancers to interact gives rise to a comprehensive array of non-specific contacts during telophase–cytokinesis. Initial microcompartment formation is promiscuous in cis and trans, and does not require loop extrusion. The formation of extrusion-independent promoter-enhancer contacts has been observed previously in different cell contexts and cell-cycle stages54,59,89,90,91,92,93. It is possible that this microcompartment serves to rapidly re-establish gene-regulatory contacts during mitotic exit. As cytoplasmic factors enter the nucleus, long-range (>1 Mb) MCD–MCD interactions are substantially reduced or pruned. We propose that G1 pruning of indiscriminate MCD contacts is driven by cohesin-mediated loop extrusion. Most MCDs overlap CTCF sites that anchor extruded loops in G1. These MCDs retain short-range interactions with other MCDs, possibly reinforced by loop extrusion. Pruning during mitotic exit ensures that MCD–MCD interactions start to obey rules of TAD formation such that interactions within extrusion domains are more likely to be retained than interactions between domains.

Because the effect of pruning can be partially reversed by RanGAP1 depletion in G1, we conclude that interphase chromatin folding is the result of continuous interplay between intrinsic affinity-based compartmentalization and cytoplasmic inherited processes, such as loop extrusion. We propose that the chromosome-intrinsic folding programme reveals a universal propensity for active gene-regulatory elements to interact through affinity-driven interactions. A second folding programme superimposes a more deterministic logic through regulated cohesin-mediated loop extrusion that ensures the specific pairing of cCREs to ensure cell type-specific gene expression.

The CRISPR–Cas9 system was used to endogenously target the RanGAP1, RCC1 (refs. 94,95), NUP93 (ref. 45) and AAVS1 (ref. 96) genes. With the exception of nuclear import assays, all experiments described here employed human colorectal adenocarcinoma DLD-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, CCL-221) expressing either RanGAP1 or Nup93 homozygously tagged with NeonGreen and an AID, infra-red protein (IFP)-tagged RCC1 and Tir1, as described previously. We refer to these cell lines as RanGAP1–AID and Nup93–AID. For cell lines used in nuclear import assays, the sequences of MBP and mScarlet were amplified by PCR from pMAL (NEB) and pmScarlet_ɑTubulin_C1 (Addgene, catalogue number 85045), respectively. The NLS sequence was synthesized and all fragments were inserted by Gibson reaction (NEB, E2611S) into the multiple cloning site of AAVS1_Puro_PGK1 vector (Addgene, catalogue number 68375) through replacement of 3×FlagTwinStep-Tag. MBP–mScarlet–NLS was inserted into the AAVS1 locus in RanGAP1–AID and NUP93–AID DLD-1 cell lines.

Modified DLD-1 cells lines (RanGAP1–AID, Nup93–AID, RanGAP1–AID/MBP–NLS and Nup93/MBP–NLS) were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in DMEM, high glucose, GlutaMAX supplement, pyruvate medium (Gibco, 10569010) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, 16000069) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco, 15140122). The cells were synchronized in prometaphase of mitosis using a standard double thymidine-nocodazole block protocol. All incubations and washes were carried out in solutions pre-warmed to 37 °C. The cells were seeded at low density in DMEM medium containing 4 mM thymidine (Sigma, T1895) and incubated for 17 h, released (after two PBS washes) for 7 h in fresh medium to replicate the genome and enter mitosis, and incubated with 4 mM thymidine for an additional 17 h to obtain synchronous populations blocked in S-phase. After the second thymidine block, the cells were released (after two PBS washes) in fresh medium for 5 h, followed by an additional 5 h incubation in the presence of 50 ng ml−1 nocodazole (Sigma, M1404) to accumulate in prometaphase. Degradation of RanGAP1–AID and Nup93–AID was achieved in prometaphase-arrested cells by the addition of 1 mM of 3-indoleacetic acid (IAA, auxin; Sigma-Aldrich, 15148). Following incubation for an additional 2 h, the control and depleted cells were either collected for subsequent analyses (described later) or released into fresh medium to progress through mitosis for 1.25 h (telophase), 1.5 h (cytokinesis) or 5 h (early G1).

To deplete RanGAP1 specifically in G1, the medium was exchanged 3.5 h after nocodazole release and adherent cells were incubated with auxin for an additional 6.5 h into late G1 (10 h). Matched 10 h control and depleted conditions were also subjected to removal of non-adherent cells at 3.5 h to ensure similar G1 synchrony. To inhibit BET protein activity during mitotic exit, 500 nM JQ1 (Selleckchem, S7110) or dBET6 (PROTAC; Selleckchem, S8762) was added to prometaphase-arrested cells in the presence or absence of auxin. After another 2 h of incubation, the control and RanGAP1-depleted cells were released for 5 h into early G1 in the presence or absence of BET inhibitors.

DLD-1 RanGAP1–AID and NUP93–AID cell lines, expressing MBP–mScarlet–NLS, were cultured on four-well glass-bottomed chambers (Ibidi) and synchronized with CDK1 inhibitor (Selleckchem, Ro-3306) for 16 h. After 15 h in the CDK1 inhibitor, the cells were treated with fresh medium or medium containing 1 mM auxin for 1 h in the presence of the CDK1 inhibitor. The cells were washed three times with fresh medium and released in regular medium or medium containing 1 mM auxin. The cells were imaged on an Eclipse Ti2 inverted microscope (Nikon) equipped with a spinning disk confocal system (UltraVIEW Vox Rapid Confocal Imager; PerkinElmer) and controlled with the Volocity software (PerkinElmer) utilizing a Nikon PlanFluor ×40/1.3 oil-immersion objective lens. The cells were imaged in FluoroBrite DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) medium. The microscope was equipped with a temperature-, CO2- and humidity-control chamber that maintained a 5% CO2 atmosphere and 37 °C. RanGAP1-NG, NUP93-NG, MBP–mScarlet–NLS and RCC1iRFP670 fluorescent protein signals were excited with 488-nm (20–24% power, 200–250 ms exposure), 568-nm (5% power, 50–60 ms) and 640-nm (100% power, 150–200 ms exposure) laser lines, and binning set to 2×, respectively. A series of six z-slices, 2 µm optical sections, were acquired every 2 min and monitored for 6 h for three independent fields. Images were captured and analysed using the Volocity (PerkinElmer) and Image J (National Institutes of Health) software. Images represent a single z-stack.

The intensity of the MBP–mScarlet–NLS in three independent regions of interest (5 × 5 pixels) was measured every 10 min in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. To calculate relative nuclear intensity, we used the following equation:

where Avg Int. Nu is the average intensity of MBP–mScarlet–NLS in the nucleus, Avg Int. Cyt is the average intensity of MBP–mScarlet–NLS in the cytoplasm and Avg Int. B is the average background intensity of MBP–mScarlet–NLS in the cell-free area. The relative nuclear-to-cytoplasmic intensity of MBL–mScarlet–NLS was plotted. Data are expressed as individual values analysed every 10 min for eight control or auxin-treated cells of two independent fields of one experiment. Assessment of MBL–mScarlet–NLS import was performed in two independent experiments.

Adherent cells were dissociated with accutase and equal numbers of cells were lysed with 2×Laemmli buffer (60 mM Tris pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 100 mM dithiothreitol) by boiling for 10 min. Proteins were separated on 4–12% NuPage bis-Tris gels using 1×MES running buffer (NuPAGE 20X buffer NP0002) for 45 min at 175 V in an Invitrogen XCell Sure-Lock mini gel and blotting system. The gels were transferred to 0.2-µm nitrocellulose membrane in Pierce 10X Western Blot Transfer Buffer, Methanol-free (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 35040) at 30 V for 1 h. For immunoblotting, the membranes were blocked with 5% milk in TBS-T (1×TBS + 0.1% Tween-20) at room temperature for at least 1 h. Primary antibodies were diluted in block buffer and incubated overnight at 4 °C and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were developed and imaged using SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 34076) and a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc system. The following primary antibodies were used: mouse anti-RanGAP1 (OTI1B4; Novus Biologicals, NBP2-02623), mouse anti-Nup93 (F-2; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-374400), rabbit anti-BRD4 (E2A7X; Cell Signaling Technologies, 13440), rabbit anti-BRD2 (EPR7642; Abcam, ab139690) and rabbit anti-vinculin (EP18185; Abcam, ab129002). The following secondary antibodies were used: goat anti-mouse IgG–HRP (Cell Signaling Technologies, 7076) and goat anti-rabbit IgG–HRP (Cell Signaling Technologies, 7074).

Immunofluorescence was performed using standard methods. For early G1 immunofluorescence, cells were released from prometaphase onto glass coverslips and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. For mitotic release experiments, the cells were first fixed and then concentrated onto glass coverslips using an Epredia Cytospin at 150g. The fixed samples were incubated with PBS containing 2% Triton X-100 for 1 h before primary and secondary antibody staining in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 and 1 h, respectively. After staining with 10 µg ml−1 DAPI in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, the coverslips were mounted in Vectashield antifade medium (Vector Labs, H-1000-10) for confocal imaging. The following primary antibodies were used: mouse anti-ɑ-tubulin (Sigma T6199), rabbit anti-histone H3pS28 (Abcam, ab5169), rabbit anti-lamin B-receptor (Abcam, ab32535), rabbit anti-lamin A (Abcam, ab26300), mouse anti-Elys (BioMatrix Research, BMR00513), rabbit anti-Nup160 (Abcam, ab73293), mouse anti-Mab414 (Abcam, ab24609), rabbit anti-SON (Thermo Fisher Scientific, PA5-65107), mouse anti-NPM1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 60096-1), rabbit anti-Rad21 (Abcam, ab154769), rabbit anti-CTCF (Cell Signaling Technologies, 2899) and rabbit anti-RNA pol II pS2 (Abcam, ab5095). The following secondary antibodies were used: goat anti-mouse IgG H&L Alexa Fluor 488 (Abcam, ab150113), goat anti-mouse IgG H&L Alexa Fluor 568 (Abcam, ab175473), goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L Alexa Fluor 488 (Abcam, ab15007) and goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L Alexa Fluor 568 (Abcam, ab175471).

Images were acquired using a Nikon A1 point-scanning confocal microscope with GaAsP detectors (488 and 561 nm lasers) or a high sensitivity MultiAlkali PMT (405 nm laser) and an Apo TIRF, 1.49 numerical aperture, ×60 oil-immersion objective (Nikon). For chromatin volume estimation, fixed DAPI-stained cells were imaged in 40–60 consecutive 0.2-µm z-slices. The 3D volume of DAPI-containing signal was used as a proxy for chromatin volume and measured using the ‘3D Objects Counter' Plugin97 of the Fiji software98 on pre-filtered (Gaussian, σ = 2) image stacks.

Cells were collected at various points of mitotic exit. Adherent cells were dissociated with accutase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A11105-01) and pooled with non-adherent collected cells to assess the entire population. To assess the cell-cycle profile (DNA content), cell pellets were resuspended in 200 µl PBS and fixed with 800 µl of cold 100% ethanol. The cells were stored at −20 °C for at least 24 h. Approximately 1 × 106 fixed cells were stained with 50 µg ml−1 PI (Thermo, P1304MP), diluted in 1 ml PBS containing 50 µg ml−1 RNase A (Roche, 10109169001) and 0.1% saponin, for 1 h at room temperature. After staining, the cells were spun, and the pellets were resuspended in 1 ml PBS and passed through a 35-µm filter (Falcon, 352235). Flow cytometry was performed on a MACSQUANT set-up. Analysis was performed using the FlowJo software (v10) and plots reflect populations gated for debris but not doublets.

Cells were collected at various points of mitotic exit and fixed for Hi-C 3.0 analysis52 with a few modifications to facilitate cell sorting. Adherent cells collected 5 and 10 h after prometaphase release were dissociated with accutase. Prometaphase (t = 0) and early (t = 1.25–1.50 h) released cells were directly collected by shake-off. Cell suspensions were pelleted and treated with accutase for an additional 5 min at room temperature to prevent aggregation and washed with HBSS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 14025134). Fixation proceeded first with 1% formaldehyde (Fisher Scientific, BP531-25) in HBSS for 10 min, which was quenched with 0.125 M glycine for 5 min at room temperature and 15 min on ice. Next, the cells were fixed with 3 mM disuccinimidyl glutarate in PBS for 40 min at room temperature with rotation, followed by a second quenching with 0.125 M glycine. The fixed cells were washed twice with PBS + 0.1% BSA and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen before staining for FACS analysis.

To sort cells by DNA content, approximately 10 × 106 fixed cells were stained with 50 µg ml−1 PI, diluted in 5 ml PBS containing 50 µg ml−1 RNase A and 0.1% saponin, for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then spun and washed with PBS before resuspension in 2 ml PBS + 0.1% BSA and passage through a 35-µm filter. Propidium iodide-stained cell suspensions were sorted on a BD FACS Melody system using the 561 nm laser for forward scatter, side scatter and PI. All populations were gated based on forward scatter/side scatter to eliminate cell debris and cells sorted for either prometaphase (4n) or G1 (2n) DNA content were also subject to doublet discrimination. To enrich for telophase or cytokinesis, cells fixed 1.25 and 1.50 h after mitotic release, respectively, were sorted based on doubled PI signal (DNA content) area and width. All sorted cells were collected in PBS containing 1% BSA and washed twice in PBS before being snap-frozen.

Chromosome conformation capture was performed as previously described52 with some modifications. Synchronized cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde and 3 mM disuccinimidyl glutarate, and enriched in specific cell-cycle stages by FACS, as described above. Sorted cells (1–5 × 106) were collected and snap-frozen for storage at −80 °C before lysis. After lysing the cells and digesting the chromatin with 400 U each of DpnII and DdeI (NEB, R0543M and NEB, R0175) overnight, the DNA ends were labelled with biotinylated dATP (LifeTech, 19524016) using 50 U Klenow DNA polymerase (NEB, M0210). Blunt-end ligation was performed with 50 U T4 ligase (Life Technologies, 15224090) at 16 °C for 4 h, followed by overnight reverse crosslinking with 400 μg ml−1 proteinase K (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 25530031) at 65 °C. The DNA was purified using phenol–chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, and concentrated on a 30 kDa Amicon Ultra column (EMD Millipore, UFC5030BK). Biotin was removed from the unligated ends in 50 μl reactions using 50 U T4 DNA polymerase (NEB, M0203) per 5 mg of DNA. Following DNA sonication (Covaris S220 system) and solid-phase reversible immobilization bead-size fractionation to generate DNA fragments 100–300 bp in length. The DNA ends were repaired using 7.5 U T4 DNA polymerase, 25 U T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB, M0201) and 2.5 U Klenow DNA polymerase (NEB, M0210). Libraries were enriched for ligation products by biotin pulldown with MyOne streptavidin C1 beads (Invitrogen, 65001). To prepare for sequencing, A-tailing was performed using 15 U Klenow DNA polymerase (3′–5′ exo-; NEB, M0212) and either TruSeq DNA LT kit indexed adaptors (Illumina, 20015964) or NEBNext multiplex oligos (NEB, E7780S) were employed. Libraries were amplified in PCR reactions for 5–7 cycles using a TruSeq DNA LT kit (Illumina, 15041757) and subjected to solid-phase reversible immobilization bead-size selection before sequencing on either an Illumina HiSeq 4000 or a NovaSeq 6000 system using the paired-end 50 bp or 100 bp modules. Two biological replicates were performed for each condition, with the exception of early mitotic exit populations in telophase or cytokinesis. Hi-C datasets have been deposited at National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)'s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; GSE277875; SuperSeries, GSE278023).

Chromatin accessibility was investigated using Omni-TAC–seq99,100 with some modifications. Prometaphase-arrested cells were collected by mitotic shake-off and adherent cells were dissociated using accutase 5 h after prometaphase release. Viable cells (50,000) were permeabilized in 50 µl cold Resuspension Buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl and 3 mM MgCl2) containing 0.1% NP-40 (MP Biomedicals, 0219859680), 0.1% Tween-20 and 0.01% digitonin (Promega, G9441) for 3 min on ice. The cells were isolated by centrifugation at 500g and 4 °C for 10 min, and the buffer was exchanged by washing once with the detergent-free Resuspension Buffer. Tagmentation was performed in permeabilized cells resuspended in 50 µl Tagmentation Buffer (Diagenode, C01019043) containing 100 nM adaptor-loaded Tn5 transposase (Diagenode, C01070012-30), 0.001% digitonin and 0.1% Tween-20 at 37 °C for 30 min with intermittent mixing. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Binding Buffer (Qiagen MinElute PCR Kit, 28004) and DNA was purified using a Qiagen MinElute PCR kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purified DNA was eluted in 21 μl Elution Buffer and stored at −20 °C for library preparation. To prepare ATAC–seq libraries for sequencing, custom barcoded primers based on a previous design101 were used in an initial five-cycle pre-amplification using NEBNext high fidelity PCR master mix (NEB, M0541). The number of PCR cycles for PCR amplification was determined using quantitative PCR. Following PCR amplification, libraries were purified using solid-phase reversible immobilization beads, with a sample-to-bead ratio of 1.0:1.5. ATAC–seq libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 2000 machine using the 50 bp paired-end reagents. Two biological replicates were performed for each condition. ATAC–seq datasets have been deposited at the NCBI GEO accession GSE277731 (SuperSeries GSE278023).

The CUT&RUN protocol was modified from Skene and Henikoff65 and applied to control or RanGAP1-depleted cell populations arrested in prometaphase or released for 5 h into G1. Approximately 5 × 106 cells per condition were harvested and lysed (0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM spermidine, 20% glycerol and Roche EDTA-free protease inhibitor; Sigma-Aldrich, 11873580001) for 10 min on ice. Due to the inclusion of prometaphase samples, the cells were centrifuged for 3 min at 600g and 4 °C after every wash or buffer exchange. The lysed cells were incubated for 5 min on ice with wash buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM spermidine, 0.1% BSA and Roche protease inhibitor) containing 2 mM EDTA and washed once more with wash buffer before resuspension in 1 ml wash buffer for antibody binding. Primary antibodies to histone H3K4me3 (Abcam, ab8580; 1:100), H3K27ac (D5E4; Cell Signaling Technologies, 8173; 1:100), H3K27me3 (Cell Signaling Technologies; 1:100) or CTCF (Cell Signaling Technologies, 2899; 1:50) were bound overnight on a rotator at 4 °C. A control IgG (guinea pig anti-rabbit; ABIN101961; 1:100) sample was included for each replicate in control prometaphase and G1 cell populations. The samples were washed three times (2 min each) in wash buffer with rotation at 4 °C, followed by pAG-MNase binding (1/20 dilution; CUTANA pAG-MNase for ChIC/CUT&RUN workflows; EpiCypher, 15-1016) for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. Following three washes (5 min each at 4 °C) with rotation, the samples were resuspended in 150 µl wash buffer and MNase was activated on wet ice by the addition of CaCl2 (final concentration of 2 mM) for 30 min. The reaction was quenched with 150 µl of 2×STOP buffer (200 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 4 mM EGTA, 50 µg ml−1 RNase A and 40 µg ml−1 glycogen) containing 1:1,000 of 10 ng ml−1 heterologous DNA (CUTANA E. coli spike-in DNA; EpiCypher, 18-1401) and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. After centrifugation at 16,000g for 5 min, the supernatant was incubated at 65 °C for 10 min with 0.1% SDS, 0.2 mg ml−1 proteinase K and 50 µg ml−1 RNase A. Extraction of DNA using 1:1 phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation was followed by AMpure XP bead (Beckman Coulter, A63881) size selection to remove fragments larger than about 700 bp. Libraries were prepared for sequencing using the NEBNext Ultra II end repair/dA-tailing module (NEB, E7546) and NEBNext multiplex oligos for Illumina (NEB, E7600 and E7780). The libraries were amplified in PCR reactions for 14–18 cycles and subjected to AMpure XP bead-size selection before sequencing on an Illumina NextSeq 2000 system using the paired-end 50 bp module. Two biological replicates were performed for each condition. The CUT&RUN datasets have been deposited at the NCBI GEO (GSE308844; SuperSeries, GSE278023).

DLD-1 cells were arrested at prometaphase, as described earlier, and released to progress through mitosis over 5 h, with samples collected every hour. The cells were labelled with 1 mM 4sU in 1-h non-overlapping intervals comprising the final hour of culture for each collection time point. Unlabelled controls were included at prometaphase arrest and at the end of the 5-h time course, and each experiment was performed in triplicate. At the end of each time point, the cells were collected and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and the cell pellets were lysed in TRIzol reagent before total RNA extraction using a Zymo RNA Clean & Concentrate kit. Before RNA extraction, six ERCC spike-ins were added to the lysed pellet at a concentration relative to the number of cells harvested: three ERCCs labelled with 10% 4sU and three unlabelled ERCCs, as described previously102. SLAM–seq libraries were prepared as previously described62. Briefly, ribosomal RNA was depleted as previously described103, the RNA was treated with 10 mM iodoacetamide to alkylate 4sU bases and libraries were prepared using a NEBNext Ultra II directional RNA library prep kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Library quality was confirmed using Agilent TAPE station reagents and libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 2000 platform (2 × 100 paired-end reads) to an average depth of 67 × 106 reads per library. The SLAM–seq datasets have been deposited at the NCBI GEO (GSE309609; SuperSeries, GSE278023).

We performed SILAC described previously81,104. Before cell-cycle synchronization, DLD-1 RanGAP1–AID and Nup93–AID cells were labelled by culturing them for five days in heavy (L-arginine-13C6, 15N4 hydrochloride and L-lysine:2HCl 13C6 15N2; Sigma-Aldrich, 608033 and Cambridge Isotope, CNLM-291-H, respectively) or light (L-arginine hydrochloride and L-lysine; Sigma-Aldrich, A6969 and L5501, respectively) DMEM for SILAC medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A33822) with dialysed fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich, F0392). SILAC was maintained throughout the cell synchronization experiment and nuclei were isolated for LC–MS. For each cell line, one replicate experiment was performed using light control and heavy IAA-treated samples, and labelling was then reversed for the second biological replicate.

Nuclei were isolated by manual disruption based on a previous protocol105 for mass spectrometry analysis. Early G1 labelled cells were collected 5 h after prometaphase release and washed with PBS. The cells (10 × 106) were carefully resuspended with a broad pipette tip in 1 ml hypotonic buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM KCl) containing 0.1 mM phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, BP172-25) and 1×protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 78440), and incubated on ice for 25 min. The cells were then ruptured by douncing 40× in a pre-chilled homogenizer (tight pestle (B)) and nuclei were isolated by centrifugation for 5 min at 1,500g and 4 °C, and resuspended in a 10 mM Tris buffer pH 7.4 containing 2 mM MgCl2. The samples were adjusted to 1×Laemmli buffer (60 mM Tris pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS and 100 mM dithiothreitol) and heated to >85 °C for 10 min before gel electrophoresis. Heavy and light samples were mixed at a 1:1 ratio of total protein based on quantification of stained gels (GelCode Blue Safe Protein Stain; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 24594). The final protein gels were stained with GelCode blue safe protein stain and bands were excised for LC–MS sample processing.

Overnight trypsin digestion was performed at 37 °C. After protein digestion and drying in a SpeedVac, the samples were reconstituted in 25 µl MS solvent (5% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid) and 3.8 µl was injected into a Fusion Lumos Orbitrap mass spectrometer in OTOT mode with a 90 min gradient. Peptides were searched against the SwissProt human database in Maxquant and proteins were subject to a two-peptide cutoff. Two replicates were performed for each condition, reversing the SILAC labelling, and >3,000 proteins were detected in each sample at 1% false discovery rate (summarized in Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Fold changes and Benjamini–Hochberg-corrected P values comparing control and depleted cell conditions were determined using the Q+ analysis by Scaffold. Full processed datasets are in Supplementary Tables 4 and 5, and raw data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE106 partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD056346.

Publicly available CTCF chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing (ChIP–seq) coverage from untreated DLD-1 cells and the corresponding bigWig (GSM4238559) was used to define cCREs and throughout the paper for visualization unless otherwise indicated. Variant 1 of the MA0139 CTCF motif annotation from the Jaspar database107 was used to define convergent extrusion loops. Publicly available RNA-sequencing data for the DLD-1-RanGAP1 cell line (GSE132363: GSM3860900, GSM3860901 and GSM3860902) were used to define active genes for visualization and ATAC–seq analysis. Raw data were processed using the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline (v.3.15.0; https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq )108. Genes with fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) > 0 in all three replicates and FPKM > 1 in the pooled dataset were defined as active. This information is summarized in Supplementary Table 3.

We used a combination of publicly available CTCF ChIP–seq coverage for DLD-1 together with the control G1 histone H3K4me3 and H3K27ac CUT&RUN and ATAC–seq data generated in this study to define CREs according to the procedure defined by ENCODE109. Briefly, we annotated the list of cell line-independent DNase hypersensitive sites from ENCODE v2 with z-score-transformed ATAC–seq, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac signal, and used the distance to the nearest transcription start site (TSS) to assign DHSs to seven CRE groups: PLS (22,555 promoter-like: open, H3K4me3 enriched, within 200 bp of the nearest TSS), pELS (28,863 combined proximal and near enhancer-like: open, H3K27ac enriched and within 2 kb of the nearest TSS), dELS (43,807 distal enhancer-like: open, H3K27ac enriched and at least 2 kb away from the nearest TSS), H3K4me3 (1,417 open H3K4me3: open, H3K4me3 enriched and at least 200 bp away from the nearest TSS), CTCF (9,911 open, CTCF enriched and not enriched in any other marks) and finally, open (43,316 open, not enriched in any marks). Where indicated, binned genomic loci were assigned one cCRE based on the following hierarchy: PLS > pELS > dELS > CTCF > just open > not open. The fold enrichment of binned cCREs in specific genomic regions was determined using the ChromHMM ‘OverlapEnrichment' function110, which normalizes the fraction of bases in a particular state (that is, PLS) found at a subset of genomic loci (that is, MCDs) to the fraction of those loci region genome-wide.

Stackups demonstrate the behaviour of a given signal (for example, H3K4me3 CUT&RUN) at a set of genomic loci, typically centred at those loci and presented as a heat map, where each row represents the signal around the individual genomic locus. We took advantage of the Python application programming interface (API)111 built around UCSC BBI library112 to extract a signal stored in a bigWig or bigBed files given a set of same-sized genomic intervals using the ‘stackup' function. We ensured our intervals had the identical size by centering on the loci of interest and providing fixed-length upstream and downstream flanks. For every stackup, we also generated a summary signal profile by averaging the stackup across all rows for every column. We used 100 kb for upstream and downstream flank sizes, and aggregated the signal into 100 bins for every row of the stackup, logarithmic colour scales were used throughout the stack-ups with the exception of EV1 profiles and bigBed-derived signals—coverages of loop anchors, MCD anchors and so on.

Hi-C libraries were processed using the distiller-nf pipeline113 (v.0.3.4): paired-end reads were mapped to hg38 human reference genome using bwa mem114 in a single-sided fashion (-SP); read alignments were parsed and classified into pairwise interactions, or pairs, by parse from the pairtools package115 (v.1.0.2) and the additional ‘–walk-policy all' option was used to rescue multiway interactions (walks); after the removal of duplicates, uniquely mapped and rescued pairs were further filtered according to their alignment quality (MAPQ > 30) and subsequently aggregated into binned contact matrices in the cooler format116 at a resolution of 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500 and 1,000 kb; contact matrices were normalized using the iterative correction normalization77 with the default parameters (for example, the first two diagonals were excluded from balancing at each resolution to avoid short-range ligation artifacts); bins with extreme genomic coverage, as detected by the MADmax (maximum allowed median absolute deviation) filter72, were masked and excluded from the analysis. Summary mapping statistics, as produced by the pairtools module from MultiQC117, are in Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1a. We used insulation tracks and cis Eigvectors to assess the reproducibility of the replicates, which were pooled together as depicted in Supplementary Fig. 1a.

To extract Hi-C features relevant for our analyses we used the cooltools package55 (v.0.7.0); specifically, we leveraged the cooltools Python API for scripting our analyses in the form of Jupyter Notebooks118. We used arms of human autosomal chromosomes (Chr 1–22) as a genome partitioning for the analyses (parameter ‘view_df') and default parameters in the API function calls unless specified otherwise. In the following sections, we provide a brief description of specific functions that were used to extract each feature.

Frequency of interactions as a function of genomic separation (scaling plots, P(s)) was calculated using balanced Hi-C data binned at 1 kb using the ‘expected_cis' function with smoothing in log-space enabled, data for chromosome arms were aggregated to generate an average genome-wide scaling. The ‘gradient' function of the numpy119 package was used to calculate the rate at which the interaction frequency changed with distance, that is, scaling plot derivatives in log-log space as demonstrated in the ‘contacts_vs_distance' notebook from the ‘open2c_examples' repository (https://github.com/open2c/open2c_examples).

Most downstream analyses require Hi-C matrices to be ‘flattened', that is, normalized to the decay of interaction frequency with genomic distance. We use the expected_cisfunction to calculate such an ‘expected'. In case of trans or interchromosomal data, matrices were normalized to average levels of interchromosomal interactions, calculated using the ‘expected_trans' function. Results of these functions were passed to the downstream analyses when applicable.

Diamond insulation score120 was calculated using the ‘insulation' function at 10 kb resolution and 100 kb averaging window size (size of the insulation diamond).

Eigenvector analysis77 was performed separately for each chromosome arm using the ‘eigs_cis' function at 10, 25, 50 and 250 kb, where gene density was used to ‘phase' Eigenvectors, that is, Eigenvector tracks were ‘flipped' if they anticorrelated the gene density track. The EV1 Eigenvectors (ones with the highest Eigenvalues, which typically correspond to Hi-C compartments) of select samples were saved as bigWig files to use in stackup analysis and visualization.

To evaluate how different classes of genomic loci interact with each other in 3D, that is, saddle plot analysis77, we used the ‘saddle' function. First, assignment of the classes to genomic loci (for example, compartment status, CRE status and so on) was done on a bin level and passed as a ‘track' parameter to the function. Second, the average level of interactions was calculated for each possible combination of classes from the flattened contact map (observed/expected). Finally, a class-pairwise average interaction matrix was constructed.

Assigning different classes to genomic bins was done in a specific manner. For published DLD-1 IPGs80, we used the chromatin state assignments directly at 50 kb resolution after merging B2/3 and B4 heterochromatin classes into ‘B'. Candidate CREs were hierarchically assigned to 10 and 25 kb genomic bins in the following order: PLS, pELS, dELS, H3K4me3-open, CTCF and finally, open sites (for example, if a given 10 kb bin contained a pELS element, then the entire bin was assigned pELS status, regardless of other elements present in that bin). ‘Continuous' EV1 tracks were digitized into 38 quantiles after excluding 2.5% of the extreme EV1 values from each end of the spectrum.

We estimated the strength of the A compartment as an enrichment of AA interactions over AB: AA / ((AB + BA) / 2), where AA is an average of observed–expected interactions between the EV1 quantiles with the 20% strongest A-compartment identity, and AB(=BA) is an average of the observed–expected interactions between the quantiles with 20% strongest A and B identities. Similarly for the B compartment, strength was estimated as: BB / ((AB + BA) / 2).

The ‘pileup' function was used to explore the local interaction pattern of a set of two-dimensional genomic features (defined by a pair of genomic locations, for example, in our case an all-by-all grid of MCDs, with their various subsets and a set of called loops). Briefly, local contact maps (normalized to the expected) centred on a given feature and with a fixed flank of 100 kb, a ‘snippet', were extracted as a stack and then averaged all together or in groups of features that meet a certain criterion, for example, in our case subgroups of the microcompartment grid by genomic distance, subgroups of the grid overlapping other features like extrusion dots or domains and so on. Cis-chromosomal pileups were performed on 10 kb contact maps, whereas trans-chromosomal pileups were performed on 25 kb maps, unless specified otherwise.

Local interaction patterns, average pileups, were also used to quantify average strength of a given genomic feature. Both for loops and the grid of microcompartments, strength was defined as a ratio between the signal in the centre of the pileup and the signal in the periphery. Specifically, we used a 50 × 50 kb window in the centre together with four 60 × 60 kb corners (as a periphery signal) for the grid of MCDs in cis, a 25 × 25 kb centre (single pixel in the middle) and four 50 × 50 kb corners (periphery) for the grid of MCDs in trans, and a 30 × 30 kb centre and four 70 × 70 kb corners (periphery) for loop strength calculations.

To detect a reference set of extrusion loops for our analyses, we pooled control Hi-C data for 5 and 10 h at 10 kb resolution (given their similarity, as demonstrated in Supplementary Fig. 1c,d) to achieve higher sequencing depth and then used the ‘dots' function to call significantly enriched interactions. We used ‘cluster_filtering=False' and otherwise the default parameters to apply more stringent singleton filtering afterwards. Detected interactions were further filtered to ensure they were compatible with the convergent CTCF–CTCF interaction.

The resulting list of 18,615 interactions/loops were also used to define extrusion domains, intuitively, it is the outermost loop from a subgroup of nested loops that defines a domain. Specifically, loops were clustered by their anchor 1 to group those situated on the same extrusion line, then most upstream anchor 1 of the cluster was used together with the most downstream anchor 2 of the cluster to define such fully inclusive intervals. Nested and significantly overlapping (when the overlap between intervals was >70% of either of the intervals) intervals from the resulting list were merged, yielding the final list of 3,401 domains.

We defined MCDs as the genomic loci/anchors that give rise to the strongly interacting off-diagonal rectangular domains that are clearly visible on the 5 h RanGAP1-depletion contact map and set out to detect them using screening procedure akin to the detection of dots: detect enriched pixels that stand out relative to the local background and after grouping them by proximity, detect those groups that continue interacting with others across distances, that is, those that continue “checkering”. Such checkering anchors are the target feature that we aimed to detect in the first place, that is the MCDs.

Next, we described specific steps involved in MCD detection. Variable size and shape of observed MCD–MCD interaction domains dictated the choice of convolution kernels that “describe” the local vicinity for a given group of pixels (Supplementary Fig. 2b): the vertical (V) kernel is meant to facilitate detection of horizontally elongated domains, whereas the horizontal (H)–vertically elongated domains, where a square-shaped group of pixels M (middle)—corresponds to the part of the domain being tested. Convolutional kernels M, V and H were swept across distance decay-corrected contact map (observed/expected) at 10 kb resolution, up to 30 MB for computational efficiency, and enriched pixels were selected with a simple thresholding approach: pixels for which the M was at least twice as bright as either the V or H. The density-based clustering approach ‘OPTICS' from the sklearn package121 (v.1.4.1; Supplementary Fig. 2c) was used to filter out singletons and small groups of enriched pixels, and preserve larger more robust groups of enriched pixels (‘min_samples = 5' and ‘max_eps = 33 kb' parameters were used). Pixels that remained after the clustering step were used to calculate the coverage of enriched pixels (or anchor valency; Supplementary Fig. 2d), and finally, we applied the 1D peak detection function ‘find_peaks' of the scipy package122 to the coverage track to detect prominent peaks (Supplementary Fig. 2e), which were treated as the final MCD anchors. Each anchor was characterized by its footprint interval and a summit—we used footprints for most of the downstream analysis, except for the average pileups and stack-ups, where we used the summits as an MCD genomic coordinate instead of the centre of the footprint. for example. The exact details of implementation are available on GitHub (https://github.com/dekkerlab/inherited-folding-programs.git).

We detected a total of 2,105 MCDs in the 5 h RanGAP1 depletion sample and 1,791 MCDs in the RanGAP1-depleted sample at cytokinesis, 68% of which were contained in the former sample. We used three subsets of MCDs for downstream analysis: 565 cytokinesis MCDs that did not overlap the 5 h ones (‘Cyto-specifc'), 1,218 cytokinesis MCDs that were also present in G1 (‘Cyto at G1' or ‘Cyto + G1') and 876 G1 MCDs that were not present in the cytokinesis sample (‘G1-specific').

We also identified 4,623 permissive MCDs by pooling the 5 h and 10 h G1 RanGAP1-depleted Hi-C samples—we refer to this set as Mega or permissive MCDs. This set generally demonstrated the same trends, albeit with the addition of weaker MCDs and potentially some erroneous MCD calls, and was only used for the spectral clustering characterization (details in the next section).

Motivated by the recent progress in the application of spectral clustering15,56 to the analysis of Hi-C data, we set out to apply this methodology specifically to the RanGAP1-depletion data. Such an analysis complements our enrichment-based MCD screening procedure, enabling us to test whether MCDs indeed demonstrate similar interaction patterns genome-wide.

To date, we performed spectral clustering of combined 5 h and 10 h G1 RanGAP1-depletion Hi-C data, following a previously described procedure15, and here we provide a brief description of our implementation and highlight key differences. We start by combining RanGAP1 depletion G1 5 h and 10 h Hi-C samples at 10 kb resolution to reduce data sparsity. The combined contact frequency map is flattened by normalizing it to the expected: average contact frequency decay with distance for intra- and interchromosome arm regions and pairwise interchromosomal interaction levels for trans data55. Additional ‘bad bins' corresponding to translocated loci were manually identified (Supplementary Table 6) and masked for further analysis to ensure leading Eigenvectors of the contact map explain compartmentalization patterns instead of the discordance between reference assembly and the state of the genome in DLD-1 cell line15. The pre-processed contact map was further balanced using an iterative correction procedure77 and finally eigendecomposed.

This procedure differs from the published approach15 by performing Eigendecomposition on a full genome-wide contact map that includes both cis and trans interactions. The primary motivation for this is to achieve Eigendecomposition at a high resolution (10 kb) relevant for MCD detection. Dense matrix Eigendecomposition at such resolution is challenging, as it would require approximately 1 TB of local memory. To overcome this, we used modified version of the publicly available prototype of sparse Hi-C contact map Eigendecomposition (https://github.com/open2c/open2c_vignettes/blob/main/sparse_eigendecomp.ipynb). This prototype leverages ARPACK123 implementation of sparse matrix Eigendecomposition, available in SciPy122 as the scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh function. The sparse contact map was fed into the function as a scipy.sparse.linalg.LinearOperator vector function that defines the matrix-vector product between our sparse contact map and said vector.

Performing Eigendecomposition on combined cis and trans data presents a challenge for interpretability due to the variation in chromosome sizes, stark contrast in sparsity between cis- and trans-contact frequencies and potential differences in cis and trans compartmentalization patterns. However, in this particular case of RanGAP1-depleted Hi-C data, we did not observe obvious effects of chromosome size variation until Eigenvector 10 (sorted by importance, that is, absolute Eigenvalue) and confirmed that the leading non-trivial Eigenvector is highly correlated to a concatenated list of chromosome-wide EV1s calculated using the cooltools.eigs_cis procedure55 at 10 kb (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Thus, we continued our downstream analysis with the 2–9 most significant Eigenvectors (Extended Data Fig. 4b), where E1 was excluded for clustering purposes as it is a trivial ‘flat' Eigenvector corresponding to the sum of rows/columns of the contact map. Eigenvectors E2–E9 were unit-normalized, weighted by the square root of the corresponding Eigenvalue and subjected to K-means clustering as described previously15. The number of clusters k = 8 was chosen as it provided optimal overlap between the permissive set of MCDs and a given MCD-associated cluster, that is, >60% of the cluster is covered with MCDs and >60% of MCDs are covered with intervals from that cluster (holds true by counting both overlapping nucleotides and number of intervals). Imposing cluster-informed grouping and sorting onto epigenetic tracks (Extended Data Fig. 4c) reveals strong enrichment for active marks H3K27ac/H3K4me3 in the MCD-associated cluster C2. There is one apparent deviation from this trend we have described so far and it is the cluster most closely associated with the A1 IPG identified in wild-type DLD-1 cells80: this cluster harbours a subset (approximately 20%) of ‘stubborn' MCDs that ‘refuse' to cluster with the ‘mainstream' MCD-associated cluster. The fate of this subset of MCDs from A1 IPG (most GC-rich, speckle-associated and early replicating15) requires further investigation and is out of the scope of this paper. Overall, we were able to capture the main trends and characteristics of MCDs as defined using our enrichment-based method; however, further development into clustering approaches might enable a more precise and comprehensive MCD detection.

Batch pre-processing of raw ATAC–seq data from control and auxin-treated RanGAP1–AID cells synchronized in prometaphase or released for 5 h to early G1 was performed using the nf-core/atacseq pipeline (v.2.1.0; https://github.com/nf-core/atacseq )108. Adaptor-trimmed paired-end reads were mapped to the hg38 reference genome using bwa mem and filtered according to the standard pipeline for mapping quality, mitochondrial reads, PCR duplicates and read length (<2,000 bp). Similarity between replicates was confirmed using DESeq2 (ref. 124) and filtered alignments were merged and de-duplicated across replicates. The summary mapping statistics of ATAC–seq samples generated in this study are in Supplementary Table 2. Fragment-length distributions were determined from binary alignment map (BAM) files using deepTools125. Read ends were derived from the filtered alignments (BAM files) and modified to account for tn5 by shifting ± reads by +4/−5 bp for use in all downstream applications. ATAC–seq coverage tracks were generated from shifted read ends using BEDtools126 and scaled to 1 × 106 mapped reads.

We used MACS3127 to find ATAC–seq peaks of accessibility in the pooled and single replicate datasets using default parameters with a shift/extend of −75/+150. Peaks called in pooled datasets were only considered true when they overlapped a peak in each of the two constituent replicates by at least 50%. To compare these pooled peaks between conditions, the union set was merged using bioframe128.

Batch pre-processing of raw CUT&RUN data from control and auxin-treated RanGAP1–AID cells synchronized in prometaphase or released for 5 h to early G1 was performed using the nf-core/atacseq pipeline (v.2.1.0; https://github.com/nf-core/atacseq )108. Adaptor-trimmed paired-end reads were mapped to the hg38 reference genome using bwa mem and filtered according to the standard pipeline for mapping quality, mitochondrial reads, PCR duplicates and read length (<2,000 bp). Similarity between replicates was confirmed using DESeq2 (ref. 124). The summary mapping statistics of CUT&RUN samples generated in this study are in See Supplementary Table 2. Read ends were derived from the filtered alignments (BAM files) and extended ±25 bp for most visualizations. Coverage tracks were generated from read ends using BEDtools126 and scaled to 1 × 106 mapped reads. Peaks of enriched H3K27ac signal were called from paired-end bedgraph files using SEACR129 with normalization to cell cycle-matched IgG controls. Bookmarked peaks are considered the subset of control G1 peaks that overlap a peak called in the control prometaphase sample.

SLAM–seq reads were aligned to Ensembl GRCh38v95 with Hisat-3N130, specifying T>C conversions. T>C conversions in sequenced reads were obtained by filtering Hisat-3N-aligned BAM files for reads with a Yf:i tag (corresponding to the number of T>C converted nucleotides) greater than one and thereafter annotated as nascent. Conversion efficiency was confirmed in ERCC spike-ins by obtaining the proportion of reads with T>C substitutions in 4sU-labelled versus unlabelled ERCC species. Global conversion efficiency was estimated by calculating the percentage of total RNA reads harbouring T>C substitutions in labelled and unlabelled samples. GRAND-SLAM was used to estimate the RNA NTR of each gene63 and genes with at least 100 reads were retained for further analyses. Fisher's exact tests were used to test for significant associations between genes expressed in different stages of mitotic exit and genes found in MCDs (alternative = greater); the resulting P values were corrected using the Benjamini–Hochberg method.

No statistical method was used to pre-determine sample size in any experiments. Two replicates for each condition were performed for most experiments (Hi-C, ATAC–seq, CUT&RUN and SILAC LC–MS). For SLAM–seq, three independent experiments were performed. Insulation tracks and cis Eigvectors were used to assess the reproducibility of the Hi-C replicates (Supplementary Fig. 2c,d), which were pooled for most of the presented plots and analyses (Supplementary Fig. 2a). ATAC–seq similarity between replicates was confirmed using DESeq2 (ref. 124) and filtered alignments were merged and de-duplicated. All conclusions were verified in individual replicates. Unless otherwise indicated, all immunofluorescence (Figs. 1c,e, 6c, 8e and Extended Data Figs. 2a,c,e–g, 8c, 9d) and western blot images (Figs. 1b, 5e and Extended Data Figs. 1a,b, 9b) are representative of at least two independent replicates, and flow cytometry panels are representative of at least three independent experiments (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2b). Nuclear import quantification (Fig. 1g) and images (Extended Data Fig. 2g) are representative of two independent experiments.

A.S. and J.D. conceived and designed the study. All cell lines were designed and engineered in the M.D. laboratory. V.A. re-designed NUP93– and RanGAP1–AID cell lines, and performed nuclear import assays and analysis. A.S. performed Hi-C, epigenomic profiling assays, proteomics and all experiments except for the nuclear import assays. S.V.V. analysed Hi-C data, developed analytical methods and supported all other analyses. A.S. analysed Hi-C, ATAC–seq and other relevant datasets. J.W.L. and A.S. performed nascent RNA labelling and SLAM–seq experiments, which was analysed by J.W.L. and A.A.P. E.N. performed preliminary analysis of RanGAP1-depletion Hi-C. A.S. and J.D. wrote the paper with input from S.V.V., V.A., J.W.L., E.N., M.C.D. and A.A.P.

a, Representative immunofluorescence images for Nup93 control and depleted cells. Loss of Histone H3 serine 10 phosphorylation (H3pS10P) and DNA content at indicated time points indicates similar mitotic exit kinetics in the presence or absence of Nup93. Scale bar, 5 um. b, DNA-content flow cytometry measurements for Nup93 control and depleted cells indicating similar mitotic exit kinetics in the presence or absence of Nup93. c, Representative fluorescent images of endogenous NeonGreen-tagged RanGAP1–AID or Nup93–AID demonstrate efficient degradation following 2 h auxin treatment during mitotic arrest and 5 h release to G. Scale bar, 10 um. d, Representative transmission electron micrographs of RanGAP1–AID- or Nup93–AID-depleted cells fixed in G1 reveal relatively small nuclei with hyper-condensed chromatin. Arrows indicate nuclear pores embedded in the double lipid bilayers of the nuclear envelope, which are not found in Nup93-depleted nuclei. e, Representative immunofluorescence images of Nup93 control and depleted cells 5 h after mitotic release demonstrating presence of nuclear lamina (lamin A) and nuclear envelope (LBR) proteins as well as the DNA-binding nuclear pore complex protein, Elys, in the absence of Nup93. Structural (Nup160) and late associating (FG-Nups) nucleoporins are not found in Nup93-depleted nuclei. Scale bar, 5 um, or 1 um (inset). f. Nuclear speckle (SON) and nucleolar (NPM1) resident proteins are mis-localized to the cytoplasm in RanGAP1–AID and Nup93–AID-depleted nuclei.

Known as the “Doomsday Glacier,” the Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica is one of the most rapidly changing glaciers on Earth, and its future evolution is one of the biggest unknowns when it comes to predicting global sea level rise.

The eastern ice shelf of the Thwaites Glacier is supported at its northern end by a ridge of the ocean floor. However, over the past two decades, cracks in the upper reaches of the glacier have increased rapidly, weakening its structural stability. A new study by the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC) presents a detailed record of this gradual collapse process.

Researchers at the Centre for Earth Observation and Science at the University of Manitoba, Canada, analyzed observational data from 2002 to 2022 to track the formation and propagation of cracks in the ice shelf shear zone. They discovered that as the cracks grew, the connection between the ice shelf and the mid-ocean ridge weakened, accelerating the upstream flow of ice.

A fast-motion video of Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica over a period of about 10 years.

The study reveals that the weakening of the ice shelf occurred in four distinct phases, with crack growth occurring in two stages. In the first phase, long cracks appeared along the ice flow, gradually extending eastward. Some exceeded 8 km in length and spanned the entire shelf. In the second phase, numerous short cross-flow cracks, less than 2 km long, emerged, doubling the total length of the fissures.

Analysis of satellite images showed that the total length of the cracks increased from about 165 km in 2002 to approximately 336 km in 2021. Meanwhile, the average length of each crack decreased from 3.2 km to 1.5 km, with a notable increase in small cracks. These changes reflect a significant shift in the stress state of the ice shelf, that is, in the interaction of forces within its structure.

Between 2002 and 2006, the ice shelf accelerated as it was pulled by nearby fast-moving currents, generating compressive stress on the anchorage point, which initially stabilized the shelf. After 2007, the shear zone between the shelf and the Western ice tongue collapsed. The stress concentrated around the anchorage point, leading to the formation of large cracks.

Since 2017, these cracks have completely penetrated the ice shelf, severing the connection to the anchorage. According to researchers, this has accelerated the upstream flow of ice and turned the anchorage into a destabilizing factor.

One of the most significant findings of the study is the existence of a feedback loop: Cracks accelerate the flow of ice, and this increased speed generates new cracks. This process was clearly recorded by the GPS devices that the team deployed on the ice shelf between 2020 and 2022.

During the winter of 2020, the upward propagation of structural changes in the shear zone was particularly evident. These changes advanced at a rate of approximately 55 kilometers per year within the ice shelf, demonstrating that structural collapse in the shear zone directly impacts upstream ice flow.

Time-series analysis of shear deformation rates, based on satellite data, also showed a sharp increase during that same winter. In parallel, the total length of the cracks and the area of ​​internal mixing grew significantly, confirming a close relationship between structural weakening and the dynamic acceleration of the ice.

The state of tension in the center of the ice shelf also changed significantly. Between 2002 and 2006, the ice was in a state of extensive tension, stretching in the direction of flow. Subsequently, it transitioned to a state of compressive tension, and since 2020, it has returned to an extensive state. Meanwhile, the area just upstream of the anchorage point has shifted from an initial state of compression to one of extension in recent years, reinforcing the idea that the shelf has lost its connection to the anchorage point.

The accumulation of structural damage to the ice shelf creates increasingly concentrated stresses, accelerating the upstream flow of ice and reinforcing the feedback loop that could trigger the complete collapse of the shelf.

The researchers caution that the deterioration patterns observed in this study could apply to other ice shelves undergoing similar weakening processes. A historical example is the Wadi Ice Shelf in the western Antarctic Peninsula, where in the 1970s an ice bulge initially stabilized the shelf but later became the starting point for the cracks that led to its disintegration.

Because the Thwaites Glacier sits on a reverse-slope bed, where the ocean floor dips inland, once retreat begins it is likely to progress toward irreversible collapse. The glacier's total mass is sufficient to raise sea levels by about 65 centimeters, and previous numerical models estimate that the baseline of the ice sheet and shelf will retreat at a rate of nearly 1 kilometer per year over the next 40 years.

These results help us understand the future of other ice shelves in Antarctica and provide key data for validating numerical collapse models. For now, all indications are that the weakening of the Thwaites Glacier ice shelf will continue to accelerate.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Brain Gear Is the Hot New Wearable","https://www.wired.com/story/expired-tired-wired-wearables/","Mon, 22 Dec 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Ten years ago, a Fitbit was about as sophisticated a wearable as you could get. The Apple Watch soon supplanted it, quickly becoming the world's best-selling smartwatch. Then came the sleeker, more unassuming Oura ring.

Now there's a new breed of wearables—built for your head. Instead of tracking your step count, heart rate, and skin temperature, these devices are designed to read your brain waves. Using electroencephalography, or EEG, they detect electrical impulses produced by the brain and use AI to make sense of them.

Take Elemind, for example. Rather than just tracking your sleep, the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company's device aims to actually improve it. Elemind's $350 headband feels straight out of Star Trek and is designed to boost sleep quality. It detects a person's brain signals to know whether they're asleep or awake and delivers a type of acoustic stimulation known as pink noise to move the brain from wakeful patterns to delta waves, which represent a deeper sleep. In a small trial of 21 participants, the device helped more than three-quarters of them fall asleep faster.

If you're the type to work smarter rather than harder, you can buy a $500 pair of headphones from Boston-based Neurable to hack your productivity. Equipped with EEG sensors, the headphones track brain activity associated with concentration—namely, beta waves—to tell users how focused they are. When I tried them out last year, they confirmed what I already suspected: My most focused working hours are during the morning. The device also nudges you to take the occasional break if it thinks you've been deeply focused for too long, a feature I appreciate as someone who spends a lot of time in front of a computer screen.

Apple is also getting into wearable brain tech. The company filed a patent in 2023 for EEG-sensing AirPods, though they have yet to hit the market. Earlier this year, however, Apple unveiled a new accessibility feature to allow its Vision Pro to be controlled with brain waves instead of physical movement. It means that the augmented reality headset can now be integrated with brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs—systems that read brain signals to allow users to control devices with their thoughts.

One neurotech company, Cognixion, is already taking advantage of the new Apple feature. The Santa Barbara, California, startup built an augmented reality app to run on the Vision Pro and a custom headband that detects brain signals. For now, Cognixion is focused on using the tech to help restore communication in people with speech impairments due to paralysis. But it's not hard to see how a Vision Pro equipped with a BCI could be adopted by a wider population for things like gaming or texting with your mind.

Earlier this year, I spoke with Andreas Melhede of Elata Biosciences, who's building what he calls the “open internet of brains,” an open-source network where anyone can create a neuro app that can run on an EEG device. The nonprofit organization created its own device and a Pong app, which it demoed this fall during a crypto conference in Singapore. Around 30 people gathered on a restaurant patio to compete in a Pong tournament, but instead of handheld controllers, competitors were fitted with a headset to track their brain signals. Their goal: Hit a ball on a screen with their paddle using just their thoughts.

Pong has been used as a proof of concept in other BCI experiments, including by Neuralink. Melhede told me the tournament was meant to be a fun way to introduce people to neurotech. Developers have already made a few other gaming apps for the Elata network, and he is hoping to attract research and wellness apps as well. “It's really up to the user what they want to do and for the developer what they want to build,” he says. He was inspired to create Elata after watching a loved one suffer from depression and anxiety, and he thought wearable neurotech could be the answer.

Other wearable makers are seeking regulatory approval as medical devices, like Apple has done for several health features on its smartwatches. Flow Neuroscience of Sweden has developed a headset that emits a type of low-intensity electrical current called transcranial direct current stimulation to treat depression. A companion app provides behavioral therapy, guidance, and monitoring. The device won approval from the US Food and Drug Administration this December as the first at-home, nondrug treatment for major depressive disorder available in the US. It's also approved in the UK, Europe, Australia, and other markets. In a clinical trial of 174 people, 45 percent of participants who received Flow's device experienced a remission in symptoms at 10 weeks compared to 22 percent of those in a control group who received a sham version. Flow expects the device to be available in the US in spring of 2026. In the UK, it is already being used by the National Health Service.

While it's becoming possible for implanted BCIs to decode inner speech and predict some unconscious thoughts, no wearable devices are sophisticated enough to read a person's private thoughts—yet. These consumer devices rely on AI to help recognize specific brain wave patterns associated with certain states of mind. But that brain wave data is still highly personal and can reveal a lot about a person's mental or emotional state. Which raises questions around how the data collected from these devices will be stored and protected. The brain is the last frontier of privacy. As if ads weren't already scarily targeted, just imagine if device makers sold customers' neuro data to third parties. Or your employer knew how many minutes during the workday you weren't all that focused.

Nita Farahany, a professor of law and philosophy at Duke University and author of the book Battle for Your Brain, about the new dawn of brain tracking and hacking, predicts that wearable neurotech will eventually become ubiquitous. “They will become commonplace to the point where they're not even wearable in the sense of headphones and earbuds but little tattoos behind your ear that are integrated with all your devices,” she says. “I think that's the inevitability of where it goes: seamless integration, brain to devices.”

If you're looking to get more organized in the new year, a planner is a good place to start, and Japanese planners might have caught your eye. Once you start looking into paper planners, it won't take long to start seeing recommendations of cult favorites like the Hobonichi Techo. If you're new to the wide world of planners, you might be wondering: What's all the hype about the Japanese versions?

There are a few key differences between popular Japanese planners and popular American ones. A primary difference is paper quality, as Japanese planners use thinner, smoother paper that's still strong enough to keep ink leakage between pages at bay, while American planners have thicker paper. You'll also see a different design aesthetic, with Japanese planners leaning more minimalist. There's also more space for you to manually customize your planner in a Japanese version, while American planners tend to come with everything pre-organized.

One isn't necessarily better than the other, since the best planner for you will depend on your own needs and what best suits the organizational side of your brain. As the resident paper planner tester here at WIRED, I've tried several popular planners from America and Japan alike, and more and more often the Japanese planners have risen to the top.

Here's a quick breakdown of the major things you'll notice when shopping for Japanese planners compared to American ones.

The biggest difference is one you'll feel right away: the paper. While popular Japanese planner makers each have their own signature paper, there's a similar experience in writing on some of the most popular planners and notebooks. Compared to American planners, Japanese planners like the Hobonichi and Kokuyo Jibun have much thinner, smoother paper, but both papers are still plenty durable and won't let ink leak through to the other side (you can faintly see the writing on the other side, though). Meanwhile, American paper planners have a cardstock feel to them, and thus American planners with the same number of pages end up much thicker than a Japanese planner.

The Hobonichi uses Tomoe River S paper; originally, Hobonichi used regular Tomoe River paper, but after the manufacturer stopped making it, Hobonichi found another manufacturer to make Tomoe River S paper, and the brand has been using it in its planners since 2024. Meanwhile, Kokuyo has two Kokuyo-exclusive papers it uses in its planners, the Thin Paper and the Mio Paper. I also tested the Jibun Techo, which uses the thin paper. Both these papers feel very similar to each other, with a smooth writing experience and no bleeding, and the pages are satisfying to touch and turn.

Japanese planners have a much more minimalist design style compared to American ones. Especially when you compare the colorful, youthful designs of American planners like Happy Planner and Ban.do to one like the Hobonichi—the Hobonichi feels very minimalist and plain. There are fun covers you can add onto Japanese planners to make them more your style, while American planners try to guess your style and offer it as an option. Depending on your personal aesthetic, that might be easy to find or quite difficult; I struggle to find a Happy Planner or Ban.do cover, for instance, that feels appropriate for my thirties.

You'll also see a lot more grid paper rather than lines or blank spaces, which was a little off-putting for me at first, but I grew to really enjoy how much freedom it gave me to use the space as I liked, and helped me keep my writing tidy versus accidentally writing crooked in an empty box.

Granular customization is a popular feature in some American planners. Brands like the Erin Condren LifePlanner are beloved for their ability to allow a user to fully customize what will be printed on each page. Others, like Agendio, give buyers the freedom to change things like page order and add special sections.

This isn't something you'll see in Japanese planners. Instead, you're given more free space to write in your own things like daily habit trackers or a daily schedule, rather than having those sections pre-made for you. You can also build a planner with different workbooks, like the Jibun Techo First Kit, which is reminiscent of refillable Filofax-style systems but with a much cooler aesthetic.

As I got used to using Japanese planners, I found I actually prefer their open-ended customization. If my goals change during the year, I'm not locked into a concept I cooked up in January—it gives me a true fresh start for each month, week, and day spread.

I've tried a few different Japanese planners this past year. Here are the ones I'll keep using in 2026.

Hobonichi

Amazon (Techo, Soft Cover)

Amazon (Techo, Faux Leather Cover)

Amazon (Techo Cousin, Soft Cover)

While Hobonichi's beloved flagship is undoubtedly the OG Techo, I love my Techo Cousin. It adds a weekly spread at the front of the planner, and the A5 size is ideal for me to have enough space to write out my daily must-haves. This includes my work to-dos, my personal to-dos, my habit tracker, and my schedule for the day, and there's still room for other miscellaneous lists or musings without needing to crack out an extra notebook.

The regular Techo is cheaper since it skips out on the weekly spread section (which you really don't need, since it's in the front of the book, separate from the daily spreads, and easy to forget about). It's also a little smaller—A6 size instead of A5. I really like the A5 size, but the regular Techo is a great and affordable place to start if you want to see if Japanese planners are for you.

Kokuyo

JetPens (B6 Slim)

Kokuyo (A5 Slim)

Kokuyo (B5 Slim)

As someone who already has a favorite weekly planner, I was surprised to find myself falling in love with the Kokuyo Jibun Techo. I got the 2026 First Kit, which included the last two months of 2025, so I've already been able to start testing it out in my daily life. It's a rarity among Japanese planners in that it has three notebooks built into it: Diary, Life, and Ideas. The Diary is the true planner part with monthly and weekly spreads, plus other pages like a book list, money tracker, and project tracker (which has become my habit tracker). The Life booklet has more prompt pages, like 100 Wishes and places to track information about your life, including a password manager and anniversaries list, and space to log your life events between ages 0 and 99. Finally, the Ideas notebook in the back is just grid paper where you can write lists and ideas to your heart's content.

All three books are interlaid in the cover to sit as one planner, but you can remove one and refill it any time. It's a really handy system, especially as someone who will definitely need to refill the Ideas booklet before the year is up. I've got the B6 slim size, and it's been a really nice size to fit onto my desk.

Midori

iMomoko (A5)

JetPens (A6)

The Midori notebooks are popular—specifically, those with MD paper. It's described as versatile, and the paper does feel plenty versatile, but it also feels a little thicker and more akin to a regular notebook than the super-thin paper you'll get on a Hobonichi or Kokuyo Jibun planner. It's still a little smoother to the touch than my American planners, though the paper weight feels similar.

I'm testing both the MD Diary and the Stand+ notebook, and I really like how the Stand+ is created to stand up on its own; it makes for a much more fun way to view my to-do list. There's a monthly calendar at the front and then grid paper pages afterward for freeform notes and lists. The Diary has a similar feel to it and a similar design, but instead of grid paper, it has lines. The lines are wide, which is nice if you have large handwriting, but it doesn't feel like enough space for me given how small the notebook is.

If you worry that you won't be able to read the Japanese characters in a Japanese planner, good news! Some of these planners also have English versions or use English phrases. The Hobonichi has English versions on Amazon, and the Jibun Techo uses English titles on its pages. For the Jibun, I still have to look up some translations since the descriptions under those titles are in Japanese, but I can usually infer how to use a page from the title and design. JetPens has an entire page dedicated to translating the Jibun Techo here.

Anyone looking for a vibe check on the populace's current feelings about AI would do well to check out the walls of the New York City subway system. This fall, alongside posters for everything from dating apps to Skechers, a newcomer made its debut: Friend. The ads were simple, telling commuters that a “friend” is someone “who listens, responds, and supports you” next to an image of the white AI companion necklace floating on a similarly white background.

It was the perfect graffiti canvas. “If you buy this, I will laugh @ you in public.” “Warning: AI surveillance.” “Everyone is lonely. Make real friends.” “AI slop.” These are just the defaced ads I noticed during my daily trips from Brooklyn to Manhattan. There were so many that it became a meme. Reaction to the ad campaign, which the company's founder said cost less than $1 million, got so loud it was covered by The New York Times.

People have always defaced New York subway ads in every way imaginable, but what happened with the Friend ads tapped into a deep angst about AI. Even as some celebrate its possibilities (drug discovery) and others decry its ramifications (environmental impacts, job erasure), the suggestion that AI's killer app could be a Loneliness Cure seemed to hit a nerve.

An actual, flesh-encased nerve.

Friend was just the latest in a series of Silicon Valley offerings debuting in 2025 that promise digital companionship. In addition to suggesting you just pour your heart out to ChatGPT, tech companies proffered AI-powered travel guides, dating app wingmen, and sexytime chatbots. Teens are increasingly turning to AI for friendship. Five years after Covid-19 isolated millions of people and more than two years after the US surgeon general declared loneliness an “epidemic,” AI has emerged as a form of social media that offers even less actual socializing than what came before.

“What's particularly striking is that these [Silicon Valley] leaders are actively and openly expressing their desire for AI products to replace human relationships, completely overlooking the role that their own companies—or their competitors—may have had in fueling the loneliness crisis the country faces today,” Lizzie Irwin, a policy communications specialist at the Center for Humane Technology, tells me in an email. “They sold us connection through screens while eroding face-to-face community, and now they're selling AI companions as the solution to the isolation they helped create.”

Social media began as a place where weirdos and people with niche interests could find each other. By the aughts and 2010s, platforms like TikTok and Instagram became places to engage with influencers and creators, who were selling you things, and less so with real-world connections. Still, these platforms taught users—that's you!—how to offload emotional labor to digital tools. (Why call your college friend when you can just tap the heart beneath their post and save yourself some time?) With AI, people don't even need to put in the effort to make friends in the first place. And bots are far less tricky to maintain relationships with than actual human beings.

“ChatGPT is not leaving its laundry on the floor,” says Melanie Green, a communications professor at the University of Buffalo, who has been studying people's relationship to media for years. What's happening now reminds her of research in the field from the early days of the internet. At the time, people were meeting and forming deep bonds with others almost entirely over chat. Computer-mediated communication allowed them to form “hyperpersonal” relationships where they were able to fill in whatever they couldn't glean from the conversation with positive attributes. Like when you presume the crush you've been Instagram-stalking must enjoy the same movies as you because they seem so cool.

Relationships with AI are similar, perhaps even more troubling, Green says, because “it's always telling us what we want to hear.” Like digitally generated toxic positivity.

Maybe this all speaks to a larger friendship problem. In April, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, founder of one of the most successful social media platforms of all time, took the idea of bot besties to a whole new level, claiming on a podcast that he knows of a stat in which “the average American, I think, has fewer than three friends” but a desire for “meaningfully more.” AI, he suggested, could be a substitute, and one day society would be able to “find the vocabulary” for why there is value in those relationships. Psychologists argued in response that AI could never replace human connections; my group chats wondered whether Mark Zuckerberg knew what it meant to have friends.

But maybe nobody knows what it means to have friends anymore. The longer I talked to researchers for this piece the more I wanted them to tell me whether the bonds people are forming with AI are akin to parasocial relationships. While those tend to be one-way, between a person and their favorite celebrity or fictional character, the way people interact with AI exposes similar patterns. They're both relationships that allow individuals to fill in the gaps with their own ideas. One involves a public figure who will never be met IRL; the other involves a bot that isn't real at all. The difference is the latter responds, and it thinks you're great.

When I bring this up to Shira Gabriel, a social psychology professor at the University of Buffalo, she agrees that friendship with AI is a type of parasocial relationship, one brought on by the fact that humans are social creatures and tend to anthropomorphize their interactions. But then she mentions something deeper: “We have a real crisis right now in America where we just don't have enough therapists for the number of people that need therapy,” Gabriel says. AI is filling in the gap. The problem is, AI may not remember the things you said the way a therapist would, and the company that made it might not stay in business forever. When AI companion maker Soulmate shut down in 2023, users mourned the loss. “People are reacting to AI losing their data as a death,” she says. That's the finding that worries her most.

Not that AI has proven to be the best at companionship to begin with. Often prone to sycophancy, bots can affirm what their users tell them and spout the kind of praise a real friend never would. This spring OpenAI rolled back an update to GPT-4o to remove an update that was “overly flattering and agreeable.” (Ideally, friends gas you up, but they never lie to do so.) Earlier this year, The New York Times spoke with several individuals who claimed chatbots had led them down paths of delusional thinking. Some people left their chatbot discussions believing they were prophets or even God.

But the delusion might have been on the part of AI companies that believe the answer to loneliness is texting with a chatbot.

Younger people, the teens raised on social media, face more harrowing outcomes. Seventy-two percent of more than 1,000 US teens surveyed have interacted with AI companions, according to a report from Common Sense Media, which partnered with investigators at Stanford to pose as teenagers and engage with chatbots. In a separate assessment, Stanford investigators found it was “easy to elicit inappropriate dialog from the chatbots—about sex, self-harm, violence toward others, drug use, and racial stereotypes, among other topics.” In September, the parents of two teens who died by suicide testified before a US Senate subcommittee asking for regulation to protect young people from the kinds of harms they allege chatbots caused their children.

Amid all of this the tide began to shift, albeit slightly, against AI friends. Pew released a report in mid-September noting that 50 percent of respondents believed AI would worsen people's ability to form meaningful relationships; only 5 percent believed AI would improve them.

“Relationship-building requires skills that cannot be created through the frictionless interactions that chatbots provide—such as navigating conflict, reading nonverbal cues, practicing patience, or experiencing rejection,” says Irwin. “These are challenging yet critical aspects of developing emotional intelligence and social competence.”

Humans are hardwired to want connection and interaction. AI can provide a stopgap, but ultimately, most people will still seek out living companions. The technology may lead to a divorce or two, but it's also true that people in relationships with AI commonly have human partners, too. If Covid taught people anything it's that small talk with baristas or subway mates are what get them through the day. “Those are things we are not going to stop needing,” Gabriel says. “And those are things that are never going to be as good on a computer.”

By the end of October, the Friend ad in my neighborhood subway station was still getting scribbled on regularly. Although, this late in the season, the sentiment written on it had been simplified to “no.” On Halloween, a creative technologist named Josh Zhong went semi-viral for a costume that consisted of a white crewneck sweater emblazoned with the Friend ad. Zhong's fellow revelers were given black markers and were permitted to scrawl graffiti on the shirt as they would the subway ads.

A few days after Halloween, I tracked Zhong down via a series of Instagram tags. I asked him about the inspiration behind the costume. “Me and my homies hate AI,” he wrote in an email, adding that it's an inherently antisocial technology. His outfit allowed them to commiserate with real people about the technology edging its way into their connections. “Unfortunately, people want to be listened to, but they don't necessarily want to listen, so it's convenient that LLMs don't weigh you down with their life problems,” Zhong says. “The sweater, on the other hand, felt like me lending a listening ear for people to vent and have at least one person care about what they have to say about AI.”

That's what friends are for.

As far as marketing goes, being able to announce (as Grado can) that your headphones are “hand-assembled in Brooklyn, USA” is not to be sniffed at.

In terms of the user's experience of a pair of the new Grado Signature S750 hard-wired open-backed over-ear headphones, though, being hand assembled turns out to be something of a double-edged sword. Like the little girl in the Longfellow poem, when the Signature S750 are good they are very good indeed, but when they are bad they are horrid.

They sound amazing, but a few small issues with fit leave a bit to be desired, which isn't something you'd expect from $1,650 audiophile headphones. Still, if you're the right type of listener, these high-end headphones present music in as pristine a manner as a nice pair of stereo speakers in a good room.

All that's very good indeed about these new Grado headphones concerns the way they sound. The company has developed a new driver for this model, a 50-mm dynamic design that uses a paper and carbon fiber composite diaphragm in front of a lightweight copper-plated aluminum voice coil. It claims these drivers are good for a frequency response of 6 Hz to 46 kHz, which is a massive tonal range for any headphones.

The new “B” ear cushions Grado has designed for the Signature S750 have a noticeably flat surface. The company suggests the arrangement reduces physical and aural fatigue by distributing the clamping pressure more evenly. It also allows the diaphragm itself to be much closer to the listener's ear than is usual, and it features a smaller-than-usual interior opening to finesse the sonic balance.

In practice, it all works splendidly. No matter the sort of stuff you choose to listen to—for the purposes of this test I tried a bit of everything, from “Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten” by Arvo Pärt to “Honey Power” by My Bloody Valentine, via “The Universe Will Take Care of You” by James Holden and Waclaw Zimpel—the Signature S750 are seemingly impossible to rattle.

No matter the source of the stuff you're listening to, they perform well. I plugged the headphones into a Naim amplifier being fed by both a Technics record player and a Cambridge network streamer, an expensive iFi headphone amplifier, and an only slightly more affordable FiiO digital audio player, and these headphones make the absolute best of all of it. If we're judging purely on sound quality, the Grado Signature S750 are among the best pound-for-pound headphones you can currently buy.

A big part of what's so straightforwardly enjoyable about them is the balance and poise they demonstrate. Tonally they're utterly lifelike, uncolored, and convincing. Frequency response is similarly even-handed and naturalistic. The unwillingness to stick their oar into the tonal quality of a recording ensures the Signature S750 are a completely coherent listen, no matter if you're listening to a single-instrument-with-voice, a full-scale symphony orchestra, or a processed electronic cut-and-paste collage. As long as a mix is made properly, you'll hear it exactly as intended.

The headphones sound notably open and spacious even by the standards of expensive open-backed headphones. The soundstage they create is big and airy, but also rigorously controlled and focused at the same time. Even with large ensemble pieces, the Grado make sure that every participant has the elbow room they need. Stage layouts are explicit, and the headphones give as much weight to the spaces and silences on the stage as they do the instruments.

Detail levels are high in every respect. Low-frequency sounds are deep and solid, sure, but they're also loaded with information regarding texture and timbre, with ample variation at every stage. The top of the frequency range carries just as much fine detail, and also is substantial enough to prevent any hint of glassiness or hardness even if you're listening at significant volume. And in between, the Signature S750 deliver the midrange in an eloquent and direct fashion. With singers, all the minutiae of character and attitude is made available just as readily as the details of tone and technique.

What else? Well, the Grado are spring-heeled where the dynamics of “quiet"" and “loud” are concerned. When that symphony orchestra charges into the final crescendo, the distance between it and the quietest passages of the piece is enormous. There's no sonic stress associated; the Signature S750 can power through the biggest dynamic upheavals without breaking sweat. And they're equally talented when it comes to the more minor and subtle, but no less significant, dynamics of harmonic and tonal variation.

Nothing is too fleeting or too low-key to escape the attention of these headphones. There's nothing prissy or analytical about them, though. They contextualize a huge amount of information not because it's a party piece, but because they're simply that well designed.

Unfortunately, we're not judging purely on sound quality, are we? When you pay $1,695 (or its equivalent) for a pair of your headphones, there are other criteria to be met. And the plain fact is that the Grado Signature S750 don't look or feel like the money they cost.

The aluminum housing that constitutes each ear cup is nicely machined and finished, and the liberal use of the metal keeps the weight down to a just-about-acceptable 460g. There's very little articulation between the ear cups and the headband, though, and some overzealous clamping force means the Signature S750 are not especially comfortable, even for those of us with heads of unremarkable size.

The headband itself is very meagerly padded, which doesn't help the comfort quotient in the slightest, and the ripples and undulations in its stitched leather covering would seem to indicate that the metal of the headband is not especially flat or smooth either.

The friction-pole mechanism for headband adjustment is no less agricultural, for all its familiarity where Grado headphone designs are concerned. And while the detachable cable is a fair bit more flexible than some older Grado models, that's not the same as saying it's meaningfully flexible. If there's a more willfully unhelpful length of cable in all of headphone-land, I've yet to encounter it.

On the subject of the cable: Grado provides 180-ish centimeters of it with a 6.3-mm termination at the end. When you're charging this sort of money for headphones, it's not outlandish to imagine your customer might have a device that accepts a balanced connection. Frankly, why there isn't a choice of cables in the packaging is, frankly, beyond me. It's something that the overwhelming majority of Grado's rivals provide as a matter of course, and though the company's website suggests there are forthcoming cable options “including a variety of lengths, as well as balanced terminations such as 4-pin XLR and 4.4mm,” these have been “forthcoming” for quite some time now, and will have a cost attached.

Rating: 7/10

I'm in no position to doubt the effectiveness of the “B” ear cushions where sound quality is concerned. After all, the Signature S750 sound superb, and Grado suggests the cushion design is a contributing factor. What I do feel qualified to say, though, is that the raw-feeling foam of the ear cushions is not especially comfortable, and that it retains and returns the wearer's body heat with something approaching glee. “Premium” and “luxurious” are not words that apply.

Ultimately, it depends on what your priorities are. There's certainly no arguing with the way the Signature S750 sound. They're uncomplicatedly impressive and periodically quite thrilling to listen to, depending on the mix. But unless you're one of those hair-shirt hi-fi fundamentalists from back in the day, one of those listeners who somehow doesn't believe outstanding sound quality is valid unless there's some suffering attached, there may well be too many shortcomings to overlook when it comes to these Grados. “Hand-assembled in Brooklyn, USA” notwithstanding.

                                What happens here matters everywhere

After taking one small but historic step for space-based AI, a Seattle-area startup called Starcloud is gearing up for a giant leap into what could be a multibillion-dollar business.

The business model doesn't require Starcloud to manage how the data for artificial intelligence applications is processed. Instead, Starcloud provides a data-center “box” — a solar-powered satellite equipped with the hardware for cooling and communication — while its partners provide and operate the data processing chips inside the box.

Starcloud CEO Philip Johnston said his company has already worked out a contract along those lines with Denver-based Crusoe Cloud, a strategic partner.

“In the long term, you can think of this more like an energy provider,” he told GeekWire. “We tell Crusoe, ‘We have this box that has power, cooling and connectivity, and you can do whatever you want with that. You can put whatever chip architecture you want in there, and anything else.' That means we don't have to pay for the chips. And by far the most expensive part of all this, by the way, is the chips. Much more expensive than the satellite.”

If the arrangement works out the way Johnston envisions, providing utilities in space could be lucrative. He laid out an ambitious roadmap: “The contract is 10 gigawatts of power from 2032 for five years, at 3 cents per kilowatt-hour. That comes to $13.1 billion worth of energy.”

Putting the pieces in place for that business is a primary focus for Redmond, Wash.-based Starcloud, which was founded in 2024 by Johnston, chief technology officer Ezra Feilden and chief engineer Adi Oltean. The co-founders are building on the experience they gained at ventures ranging from SpaceX's Starlink operation to Airbus and McKinsey & Co.

Starcloud was one of the first startups to look seriously into the idea of using satellites as data centers. Initially, the business model focused on processing data from other satellites before sending it down to Earth, thus economizing on the cost of downlinking the raw data. Now, tech companies are also gauging the benefits of uplinking data to orbital data centers for processing.

The leading companies in AI — including OpenAI, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta — are spending hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers that are increasingly hungry for square footage, electrical power and cooling capacity. That has led the titans of AI, and startups like Starcloud and Sophia Space, to look toward Earth orbit as the next frontier.

RELATED: Full coverage of the data center boom

Starcloud's first big move in space came with last month's launch of Starcloud-1, a 130-pound satellite equipped with an Nvidia H100 chip. Launched by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, the mission aimed to prove that the hardware on Starcloud-1 could process AI data reliably in the harsh radiation environment of outer space.

This month, executives confirmed success. Using the Nvidia chip, Starcloud trained a large language model called NanoGPT, a feat that hadn't been done in space before. The AI agent was trained on the complete works of William Shakespeare — and so it answered queries in sometimes-stilted Shakespearean English. (For example, “They can it like you from me speak.”)

Starcloud-1 produced better results with a pre-trained version of Gemma, an open-source AI model from Google. When asked for its first statement, Gemma responded with “Greetings, Earthlings! Or, as I prefer to think of you — a fascinating collection of blue and green.”

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, who is now executive chairman and CEO of Relativity Space, said in a post to X that Gemma's performance was “a seriously cool achievement.”

Coming up with orbital witticisms is only the beginning. “We're also going to be running some more practical workloads,” Johnston said.

Next year, Starcloud-1's Nvidia H100 chip will start analyzing synthetic-aperture radar data from Capella Space's satellite constellation. “The idea is that we can draw insights from that data on orbit and not have to wait a few days to downlink all that data over very slow RF ground-station links,” Johnston said.

Starcloud-2 is due for launch next October, with about 100 times the power-generating capability of its predecessor. It will carry multiple H100 chips and Nvidia's more advanced Blackwell B200 chip. “We're also flying some on-premises hardware from one of the big hyperscalers. I can't say exactly who yet,” Johnston said.

“From there, we scale up to Starcloud-3, which is about a 2-ton, 100-kilowatt spacecraft that will launch on the Starship ‘Pez Dispenser' form factor,” he said. “So we can launch many of those.”

How many? Johnston envisions a constellation of tens of thousands of satellites in low Earth orbit, or LEO. The satellites would travel in a globe-girdling “train,” with data transmitted from one satellite to the next one via laser links. “We just basically have a laser fixed [on each satellite], and then we very slightly adjust with a very finely tuned mirror. … You have one target that you're aiming for,” Johnston said.

Johnston said the company has begun the process of seeking a license from the Federal Communications Commission for the Starcloud-3 constellation. The plan also depends on the development schedule for SpaceX's Starship super-rocket, which would be charged with deploying the satellites.

Starcloud will need funding as well, from investors and from potential customers such as the U.S. Space Force. “We've raised about $34 million as of today,” Johnston said. “So we are funded actually through the next two launches at least.” He said the company may consider a Series A funding round in the first half of 2026 to support the development of Starcloud-3.

Starcloud currently has 12 team members. “We could easily triple the size of the team now … but we've got some of the most kick-ass engineers in the business,” Johnston said. The company is likely to be looking for a bigger facility next year. “We'll stay in Redmond, almost certainly,” Johnston said.

Over the past year, industry observers have been debating whether orbital data centers could really offer a better value proposition than terrestrial data centers. But in light of the interest that's been coming from the likes of SpaceX's Elon Musk and Blue Origin's Jeff Bezos, Johnston feels as if the debate has now been settled.

“People seem to trust that if Elon wants to do it, then there must be a sensible way to figure that out,” Johnston said.

Can Starcloud handle the competition from SpaceX or the dominant players in the data center market? Johnston noted that Google recently announced an AI-in-space moonshot called Project Suncatcher, “which is exactly what we're doing.”

“They're paying Planet Labs to do a demo in 2027, and as I understand it, the demo they're doing in 2027 is less powerful than the one we've got in orbit — so we have a massive head start against all of those guys, AWS and SpaceX being the exceptions,” Johnston said. 

“I think we become an interesting partner for some of those folks,” he added. “And I don't mean an acquisition target necessarily. I do mean potentially a partner.”

Putting tens of thousands of satellites in low Earth orbit sounds like a job of astronomical proportions. But if everything comes together the way Johnston hopes, Starcloud's power-generating, data-crunching satellites could go even farther on the final frontier.

“There are many different places you can put them, further away from Earth,” Johnston said. “We're looking at lunar orbits. We're looking at some other Lagrangian points — the lunar L1 to Earth, also just the Earth L1. It's actually less radiation than in LEO.”

TikTok Shop has rolled out a new feature that allows users to purchase digital gift cards, making it easier to help friends and family buy from the millions of products on the app.

​The feature was strategically launched during the holiday season — a high-stakes period for the company's shopping division as it aims to prove its value in the market. ​This move into digital gifting positions TikTok Shop to compete more directly with e-commerce giants like Amazon and eBay, both of which offer gift card options. TikTok Shop has also recently expanded into luxury retail, another move to solidify its footing in e-commerce.

Users can load the gift cards with anything from $10 to $500. What sets these cards apart is the ability to personalize them using a wide variety of animated designs. There are also animations for thank-you cards, birthdays, weddings, and other occasions.

Gift cards are delivered via email, and recipients must have a TikTok account. Once redeemed, the card's value is instantly credited to their TikTok Balance. Recipients can reply with a thank-you note or even send a gift card in return.

However, the gift cards can only be purchased in the U.S. for now.

TikTok said it plans to add features that let users personalize gift cards more. By early 2026, users will be able to record or upload video messages to attach to their digital gift cards. A company spokesperson said the experience will also include an “interactive unboxing that captures their reaction in real-time,” but declined to share further details.

The launch of digital gift cards comes on the heels of a significant milestone for TikTok Shop: Over the four days of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the app recorded sales of more than $500 million in the U.S.

However, despite this achievement, TikTok Shop faces uncertainty as the sale of the app's U.S. operations to an American investor group looms. If a sale doesn't occur, TikTok faces a potential ban in the country. President Trump has extended the deadline to January 23, 2026, leaving the app's future in the U.S. hanging in the balance.

While a shaker, some mixing tools and ice can do the job just fine, modern tech has enabled the invention of some impressive gadgets that can spritz up your home bartending game. 

From machines that can prepare cocktails in seconds to smart coasters that ensure the perfect pour, here's a rundown of some devices you should consider adding to your bar.

Pressing a button to summon cocktails might sound like the stuff of sci-fi, but they're already here.

Bartesian's cocktail maker is one of the more popular robotic bartenders on the market, and can prepare cocktails on demand in about 30 seconds. Fill the machine with your spirit of choice in the designated reservoirs, then insert a cocktail capsule (an eight-pack costs around $20 and makes eight drinks) containing a mix of juices, bitters and extracts. 

Use the touchscreen to adjust your preferred strength from mocktail to strong, then press mix.

I've no doubt beer lovers will agree that there's no matching the experience of sipping on a beer you've made yourself. iGulu's automated beer brewer takes the drudgery out of the entire process, as it works with pre-packaged ingredient kits that include everything you need: extracts, hops, bitters, dry yeast, and ground grains. Just pour in the contents and add water. Even complete beginners can start brewing right away.

Each kit is designed to brew one gallon, or eight pints. The fermentation takes 7 to 13 days, depending on the recipe. The built-in container keeps your beer cold and fresh for at least 30 days.

You can also connect the brewer to an app to monitor fermentation time, carbonation levels, and adjust the temperature as needed.

The device is surprisingly versatile, too: Besides beer, the iGulu can also be used to make hard apple cider, kombucha, fruit wine, and non-alcoholic beverages like fermented tea, sparkling water, and even yogurt.

From the folks who created a $1,500 robot bartender, the Barsys Coaster offers a more budget-friendly option for anyone learning how to avoid overpouring when making cocktails. 

This smart coaster aims to help you prepare a well-blended beverage by lighting up to indicate when to start and stop pouring each ingredient. Simply connect it to the Barsys app, select a recipe, place a cup on the coaster, and follow the step-by-step guide.

Want to get fancy and serve smoked cocktails? Even if you don't, a cocktail and whiskey smoker is a fun gadget to have. 

This one from Smokpub allows you to add smoky flavors to your drinks without using open flames. Simply load it with wood chips — available flavors include oak, apple, hickory, cherry, pear, and beech — put it on your glass with the safety cover, press the electric ignition, and let the smoke infuse your drink.

This may not be the fanciest pick on the list, but an automatic dispenser is a practical choice for pouring drinks with consistency and avoid spills, especially when mixing multiple drinks. Now that the holidays are upon us, this may prove handy if you want to avoid clumsy hands accidentally knocking over expensive bottles at your next holiday party.

My father ran his own TV repair shop for many years. When I was a teen he helped me make a Tesla coil out of a simple oscillator and the flyback transformer from a scrapped TV. It would make a spark 2 or 3 inches long and could illuminate a florescent light from several feet away. It definitely produced higher voltage than normally exists in a TV, but not orders of magnitude more. The high voltage circuits in CRTs are dangerous as hell.

That was nothing compared to the time the CAT scan machine fell face down off the lift gate on the back of the delivery truck because our driver pushed the wrong button and tipped it instead of lowering it, but I missed the flack from that because I was on a move somewhere thankfully.

I happened to have noticed that they were trying to clear out any remaining floor models of CRTs. One of them was an absolutely giant Samsung, memory says it was >34"", but I'm not sure how big...with a sticker on it for, and I'll never forget this...$.72.Soooo two big TVs for the price of one!Long story short, we were moving out of that house, CRT tvs were long since obsolete and that TV hadn't even been turned on for at least 5 years. So we decided to throw it away. I had never picked it up before and had forgotten how heavy CRTs could be. I ended up having to get two friends to come help me move it to the curb, it was well over 250 lbs. The trash company also complained when they had to pick it up and had to make a return trip.I kinda regret getting rid of it, but it was among the heaviest pieces of furniture in our house.

The only time the electron gun was not involved in producing visible light was during overscan, horizontal retrace, and the vertical blanking interval.  They spent the entire rest of their time (the very vast majority of their time) busily drawing rasterized images onto phosphors (with their own persistence!) for display.This resulted in a behavior that was ridiculously dissimilar to a 30Hz strobe light.

reply

If you wanted more vertical resolution then you needed either a monitor with a higher horizontal refresh rate or you needed to reduce the effective vertical refresh rate. The former involved more expensive monitors, the latter was typically implemented by still having the CRT refresh at 60Hz but drawing alternate lines each refresh. This meant that the effective refresh rate was 30Hz, which is what you're alluding to.But the reason you're being downvoted is that at no point was the CRT running with a low refresh rate, and best practice was to use a mode that your monitor could display without interlace anyway. Even in the 80s, using interlace was rare.

When I was a kid I lived down in Southeastern Kentucky (Somerset) which gets a lot of its power from the local lake via hydro. My grandfather had this large (not this big but big) tube TV, the old wooden case kind. When you turned it on it'd take about ten seconds in which you could hear tube heaters tinkling, followed by a ""grrrnnnnnzzzzz"" sound as the tube came to life. I remember my uncle joking that the lake level started visibly falling.Between LCDs/etc. and LED lighting, the amount of efficiency improvement we've done in home electronics is wild. I can now put my hand right on an equivalent to 100W light output light bulb and it's just... warm.

One project aims to harness local geothermal resources to pull CO2 from the air. Will it prove that carbon removal can really help our warming planet?

The earth around Lake Naivasha, a shallow freshwater basin in south-central Kenya, does not seem to want to lie still. 

Ash from nearby Mount Longonot, which erupted as recently as the 1860s, remains in the ground. Obsidian caves and jagged stone towers preside over the steam that spurts out of fissures in the soil and wafts from pools of boiling-hot water—produced by magma that, in some areas, sits just a few miles below the surface. 

It's a landscape born from violent geologic processes some 25 million years ago, when the Nubian and Somalian tectonic plates pulled apart. That rupture cut a depression in the earth some 4,000 miles long—from East Africa up through the Middle East—to create what's now called the Great Rift Valley. 

This volatility imbues the land with vast potential, much of it untapped. The area, no more than a few hours' drive from Nairobi, is home to five geothermal power stations, which harness the clouds of steam to generate about a quarter of Kenya's electricity. But some energy from this process escapes into the atmosphere, while even more remains underground for lack of demand. 

That's what brought Octavia Carbon here. 

In June, just north of the lake in the small but strategically located town of Gilgil, the startup began running a high-stakes test. It's harnessing some of that excess energy to power four prototypes of a machine that promises to remove carbon dioxide from the air in a manner that the company says is efficient, affordable, and—crucially—scalable.

In the short term, the impact will be small—each device's initial capacity is just 60 tons per year of CO2—but the immediate goal is simply to demonstrate that carbon removal here is possible. The longer-term vision is far more ambitious: to prove that direct air capture (DAC), as the process is known, can be a powerful tool to help the world keep temperatures from rising to ever more dangerous levels. 

“We believe we are doing what we can here in Kenya to address climate change and lead the charge for positioning Kenya as a climate vanguard,” Specioser Mutheu, Octavia's communications lead, told me when I visited the country last year. 

The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has stated that in order to keep the world from warming more than 1.5 °C over preindustrial levels (the threshold set out in the Paris Agreement), or even the more realistic but still difficult 2 °C, it will need to significantly reduce future fossil-fuel emissions—and also pull from the atmosphere billions of tons of carbon that have already been released. 

Some argue that DAC, which uses mechanical and chemical processes to suck carbon dioxide from the air and store it in a stable form (usually underground), is the best way to do that. It's a technology with immense promise, offering the possibility that human ingenuity and innovation can get us out of the same mess that development caused in the first place. 

Last year, the world's largest DAC plant, Mammoth, came online in Iceland, offering the eventual capacity to remove up to 36,000 tons of CO₂ per year—roughly equal to the emissions of 7,600 gas-powered cars. The idea is that DAC plants like this one will remove and permanently store carbon and create carbon credits that can be purchased by corporations, governments, and local industrial producers, which will collectively help keep the world from experiencing the most dangerous effects of climate change. 

Now, Octavia and a growing number of other companies, politicians, and investors from Africa, the US, and Europe are betting that Kenya's unique environment holds the keys to reaching this lofty goal—which is why they're pushing a sweeping vision to remake the Great Rift Valley into the “Great Carbon Valley.” And they hope to do so in a way that provides a genuine economic boost for Kenya, while respecting the rights of the Indigenous people who live on this land. If they can do so, the project could not just give a needed jolt to the DAC industry—it could also provide proof of concept for DAC across the Global South, which is particularly vulnerable to the ravages of climate change despite bearing very little responsibility for it. 

But DAC is also a controversial technology, unproven at scale and wildly expensive to operate. In May, an Icelandic news outlet published an investigation into Climeworks, which runs the Mammoth plant, finding that it didn't even pull in enough carbon dioxide to offset its own emissions, let alone the emissions of other companies. 

Critics also argue that the electricity DAC requires can be put to better use cleaning up our transportation systems, heating our homes, and powering other industries that still rely largely on fossil fuels. What's more, they say that relying on DAC can give polluters an excuse to delay the transition to renewables indefinitely. And further complicating this picture is shrinking demand from governments and corporations that would be DAC's main buyers, which has left some experts questioning whether the industry will even survive. 

Carbon removal is a technology that seems always on the verge of kicking in but never does, says Fadhel Kaboub, a Tunisian economist and advocate for an equitable green transition. “You need billions of dollars of investment in it, and it's not delivering, and it's not going to deliver anytime soon. So why do we put the entire future of the planet in the hands of a few people and a technology that doesn't deliver?” 

Layered on top of concerns about the viability and wisdom of DAC is a long history of distrust from the Maasai people who have called the Great Rift Valley home for generations but have been displaced in waves by energy companies coming in to tap the land's geothermal reserves. And many of those remaining don't even have access to the electricity generated by these plants. 

It's an immensely complicated landscape to navigate. But if the project can indeed make it through, Benjamin Sovacool, an energy policy researcher and director of the Boston University Institute for Global Sustainability, sees immense potential for countries that have been historically marginalized from climate policy and green energy investment. Though he's skeptical about DAC as a near-term climate solution, he says these nations could still see big benefits from what could be a multitrillion-dollar industry. 

“[Of] all the technologies we have available to fight climate change, the idea of reversing it by sucking CO2 out of the air and storing it is really attractive. It's something even an ordinary person can just get,” Sovacool says. “If we're able to do DAC at scale, it could be the next huge energy transition.” 

But first, of course, the Great Carbon Valley has to actually deliver.

The “Great Carbon Valley” is both a broad vision for the region and a company founded to shepherd that vision into reality. 

Bilha Ndirangu, a 42-year-old MIT electrical engineering graduate who grew up in Nairobi, has long worried about the impacts of climate change on Kenya. But she doesn't want the country to be a mere victim of rising temperatures, she tells me; she hopes to see it become a source of climate solutions. So in 2021, Ndirangu cofounded Jacob's Ladder Africa, a nonprofit with the goal of preparing African workers for green industries. 

She also began collaborating with the Kenyan entrepreneur James Irungu Mwangi, the CEO of Africa Climate Ventures, an investment firm focused on building and accelerating climate-smart businesses. He'd been working on an idea that spoke to their shared belief in the potential for the country's vast geothermal capacity; the plan was to find buyers for Kenya's extra geothermal energy in order to kick-start the development of even more renewable power. One energy-hungry, climate-positive industry stood out: direct air capture of carbon dioxide. 

The Great Rift Valley was the key to this vision. The thinking was that it could provide the cheap energy needed to power affordable DAC at scale while offering an ideal geology to effectively store carbon deep underground after it was extracted from the air. And with nearly 90% of the country's grid already powered by renewable energy, DAC wouldn't be siphoning power away from other industries that need it. Instead, attracting DAC to Kenya could provide the boost needed for energy providers to build out their infrastructure and expand the grid—ideally connecting the roughly 25% of people in the country who lack electricity and reducing scenarios in which power has to be rationed. 

“This push for renewable energy and the decarbonization of industries is providing us with a once-in-a-lifetime sort of opportunity,” Ndirangu tells me. 

So in 2023, the pair founded Great Carbon Valley, a project development company whose mission is attracting DAC companies to the area, along with other energy-intensive industries looking for renewable power. 

It has already brought on high-profile companies like the Belgian DAC startup Sirona Technologies, the French DAC company Yama, and Climeworks, the Swiss company that operates Mammoth and another DAC plant in Iceland (and was on MIT Technology Review's 10 Breakthrough Technologies list in 2022, and the list of Climate Tech Companies to Watch in 2023). All are planning on launching pilot projects in Kenya in the coming years, with Climeworks announcing plans to complete its Kenyan DAC plant by 2028. GCV has also partnered with Cella, an American carbon-storage company that works with Octavia, and is facilitating permits for the Icelandic company Carbfix, which injects the carbon from Climeworks' DAC facilities.

“Climate change is disproportionately impacting this part of the world, but it's also changing the rules of the game all over the world,” Cella CEO and cofounder Corey Pattison tells me, explaining the draw of Mwangi and Ndirangu's concept. “This is also an opportunity to be entrepreneurial and creative in our thinking, because there are all of these assets that places like Kenya have.”

Not only can the country offer cheap and abundant renewable energy, but supporters of Kenyan DAC hope that the young and educated local workforce can supply the engineers and scientists needed to build out this infrastructure. In turn, the business could open opportunities to the country's roughly 6 million un- or under-employed youths. 

“It's not a one-off industry,” Ndirangu says, highlighting her faith in the idea that jobs will flow from green industrialization. Engineers will be needed to monitor the DAC facilities, and the additional demand for renewable power will create jobs in the energy sector, along with related services like water and hospitality. 

“You're developing a whole range of infrastructure to make this industry possible,” she adds. “That infrastructure is not just good for the industry—it's also just good for the country.”

In June of last year, I walked up a dirt path to the HQ of Octavia Carbon, just off Nairobi's Eastern Bypass Road, on the far outskirts of the city. 

The staffers I met on my tour exuded the kind of boundless optimism that's common in early-stage startups. “People used to write academic articles about the fact that no human will ever be able to run a marathon in less than two hours,” Octavia CEO Martin Freimüller told me that day. The Kenyan marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge broke that barrier in a race in 2019. A mural of him features prominently on the wall, along with the athlete's slogan, “No human is limited.” 

“It's impossible, until Kenya does it,” Freimüller added. 

Although not an official partner of Ndirangu's Great Carbon Valley venture, Octavia aligns with the larger vision, he told me. The company got its start in 2022, when Freimüller, an Austrian development consultant, met Duncan Kariuki, an engineering graduate from the University of Nairobi, in the OpenAir Collective, an online forum devoted to carbon removal. Kariuki introduced Freimüller to his classmates Fiona Mugambi and Mike Bwondera, and the four began working on a DAC prototype, first in lab space borrowed from the university and later in an apartment. It didn't take long for neighbors to complain about the noise, and within six months, the operation had moved to its current warehouse. 

That same year, they announced their first prototype, affectionately called Thursday after the day it was unveiled at a Nairobi Climate Network event. Soon, Octavia was showing off its tech to high-profile visitors including King Charles III and President Joe Biden's ambassador to Kenya, Meg Whitman. 

Three years later, the team has more than 40 engineers and has built its 12th DAC unit: a metal cylinder about the size of a large washing machine, containing a chemical filter using an amine, an organic compound derived from ammonia. (Octavia declined to provide further details about the arrangement of the filter inside the machine because the company is awaiting approval of a patent for the design.)

Hannah Wanjau, an engineer at the company, explained how it works: Fans draw air from the outside across the filter, causing carbon dioxide (which is acidic) to react with the basic amine and form a carbonate salt. When that mixture is heated inside a vacuum to 80 to 100 °C, the CO2 is released, now as a gas, and collected in a special chamber, while the amine can be reused for the next round of carbon capture. 

The amine absorption method has been used in other DAC plants around the world, including those operated by Climeworks, but Octavia's project stands apart on several key fronts. Wanjau explained that its technology is tailored to suit the local climate; the company has adjusted the length of time for absorption and the temperature for CO2 release, making it a potential model for other countries in the tropics. 

And then there's its energy source: The device operates on more than 80% thermal energy, which in the field will consist of the extra geothermal energy that the power plants don't convert into electricity. This energy is typically released into the atmosphere, but it will be channeled instead to Octavia's machines. What's more, the device's modular design can fit inside a shipping container, allowing the company to easily deploy dozens of these units once the demand is there, Mutheu told me. 

This technology is being tested in the field in Gilgil, where Mutheu told me the company is “continuing to capture and condition CO₂ as part of our ongoing operations and testing cycles.” (She declined to provide specific data or results at this stage.)

Once the CO2 is captured, it will be heated and pressurized. Then it will be pumped to a nearby storage facility operated by Cella, where the company will inject the gas into fissures underground. The region's special geology again offers an advantage: Much of the rock found underground here is basalt, a volcanic mineral that contains high concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions. They react with carbon dioxide to form substances like calcite, dolomite, and magnesite, locking the carbon atoms away in the form of solid minerals. 

This process is more durable than other forms of carbon storage, making it potentially more attractive to buyers of carbon credits, says Pattison, the Cella CEO. Non-geologic carbon mitigation methods, such as cookstove replacement programs or nature-based solutions like tree planting, have recently been rocked by revelations of fraud or exaggeration. The money for Cella's pilot, which will see the injection of 200 tons of CO2 this year, has come mainly from the Frontier advance market commitment, under which a group of companies including Stripe, Google, Shopify, Meta, and others has collectively pledged to spend $1 billion on carbon removal by 2030. 

These projects have already opened up possibilities for young Kenyans like Wanjau. She told me there were not a lot of opportunities for aspiring mechanical engineers like her to design and test their own devices; many of her classmates were working for construction or oil companies, or were unemployed. But almost immediately after graduation, Wanjau began working for Octavia. 

“I'm happy that I'm trying to solve a problem that's a real-world issue,” she told me. “Not many people in Africa get a chance to do that.” 

Despite the vast enthusiasm from partners and investors, the Great Carbon Valley faces multiple challenges before Ndirangu and Mwangi's vision can be fully realized. 

Since its start, the venture has had to contend with “this perception that doing projects in Africa is risky,” says Ndirangu. Of the dozens of DAC facilities planned or in existence today, only a handful are in the Global South. Indeed, Octavia has described itself as the first DAC plant to be located there. “Even just selling Kenya as a destination for DAC was quite a challenge,” she says.

So Ndirangu played up Kenya's experience developing geothermal resources, as well as local engineering talent and a lower cost of labor. GCV has also offered to work with the Kenyan government to help companies secure the proper permits to break ground as soon as possible. 

Ndirangu says that she's already seen “a real appetite” from power producers who want to build out more renewable-energy infrastructure, but at the same time they're waiting for proof of demand. She envisions that once that power is in place, lots of other industries—from data centers to producers of green steel, green ammonia, and sustainable aviation fuels—will consider basing themselves in Kenya, attracting more than a dozen projects to the valley in the next few years.  

But recent events could dampen demand (which some experts already worried was insufficient). Global governments are retreating from climate action, particularly in the US. The Trump administration has dramatically slashed funding for development related to climate change and renewable energy. The Department of Energy appears poised to terminate a $50 million grant to a proposed Louisiana DAC plant that would have been partially operated by Climeworks, and in May, not long after that announcement, the company said it was cutting 22% of its staff. 

At the same time, many companies that would have likely been purchasers of carbon credits—and that a few years ago had voluntarily pledged to reduce or eliminate their carbon emissions—are quietly walking back their commitments. Over the long term, experts warn, there are limits to the amount of carbon removal that companies will ever voluntarily buy. They argue that governments will ultimately have to pay for it—or require polluters to do so. 

Further compounding all these challenges are costs. Critics say DAC investments are a waste of time and money compared with other forms of carbon drawdown. As of mid-December, carbon removal credits in the European Union's Emissions Trading System, one of the world's largest carbon markets, were priced at around $84 per ton. The average price per DAC credit, for comparison, is nearly $450. Natural processes like reforestation absorb millions of tons of carbon annually and are far cheaper (though programs to harness them for carbon credits are beset with their own controversies). Ultimately, DAC continues to operate on a small scale, removing only about 10,000 metric tons of CO2 each year.

Even if DAC suppliers do manage to push past these obstacles, there are still thorny questions coming from inside Kenya. Groups like Power Shift Africa, a Nairobi-based think tank that advocates for climate action on the continent, have derided carbon credits as “pollution permits” and blamed them for delaying the move toward electrification. 

“The ultimate goal of [carbon removal] is that you can say at the end, well, we can actually continue our emissions and just recapture them with this technology,” says Kaboub, the Tunisian economist, who has worked with Power Shift Africa. “So there's no need to end fossil fuels, which is why you get a lot of support from oil countries and companies.”

Another problem he sees is not limited to DAC but extends to the way that Kenya and other African nations are pursuing their goal of green industrialization. While Kenyan President William Ruto has courted international financial investment to turn Kenya into a green energy hub, his administration's policies have deepened the country's external debt, which in 2024 was equal to around 30% of its GDP. Geothermal energy development in Kenya has often been financed by loans from international institutions or other governments. As its debt has risen, the country has enacted national austerity measures that have sparked deadly protests.

Kenya may indeed have advantages over other countries, and DAC costs will most likely go down eventually. But some experts, such as Boston University's Sovacool, aren't quite sold on the idea that the Great Carbon Valley—or any DAC venture—can significantly mitigate climate change. Sovacool's research has found that at best, DAC will be ready to deploy on the necessary scale by midcentury, much too late to make it a viable climate solution. And that's if it can overcome additional costs—such as the losses associated with corruption in the energy sector, which Sovacool and others have found is a widespread problem in Kenya. 

Nevertheless, others within the carbon removal industry remain more optimistic about DAC's overall prospects and are particularly hopeful that Kenya can address some of the challenges the technology has encountered elsewhere. Cost is “not the most important thing,” says Erin Burns, executive director of Carbon180, a nonprofit that advocates for the removal and reuse of carbon dioxide. “There's lots of things we pay for.” She notes that governments in Japan, Singapore, Canada, Australia, the European Union, and elsewhere are all looking at developing compliance markets for carbon, even though the US is stagnating on this front. 

The Great Carbon Valley, she believes, stands poised to benefit from these developments. “It's big. It's visionary,” Burns says. “You've got to have some ambition here. This isn't something that is like deploying a technology that's widely deployed already. And that comes with an enormous potential for huge opportunity, huge gains.”

More than any external factor, the Great Carbon Valley's future is perhaps most intimately intertwined with the restless earth on which it's being built, and the community that has lived here for centuries. 

To the Maasai people, nomadic pastoralists who inhabit swathes of Eastern Africa, including Kenya, this land around Lake Naivasha is “ol-karia,” meaning “ochre,” after the bright red clay found in abundance.

South of the lake is Hell's Gate National Park, a 26-square-mile nature reserve where the region's five geothermal power complexes—with a sixth under construction—churn on top of the numerous steam vents. The first geothermal power plant here was brought into service in 1981 by KenGen, a majority-state-owned electricity company; it was named Olkaria. 

But for decades most of the Maasai haven't had access to that electricity. And many of them have been forced off the land in a wave of evictions. In 2014, construction on a KenGen geothermal complex expelled more than 2,000 people and led to a number of legal complaints. At the same time, locals living near a different, privately owned geothermal complex 50 miles north of Naivasha have complained of noise and air pollution; in March, a Kenyan court revoked the operating license of one of the project's three plants. 

Neither Octavia or Cella is powered by output from these two geothermal producers, but activists have warned that similar environmental and social harms could resurface if demand for new geothermal infrastructure grows in Kenya—demand that could be driven by DAC. 

Ndirangu says she believes some of the complaints about displacement are “exaggerated,” but she nonetheless acknowledges the need for stronger community engagement, as does Octavia. In the long term, Ndirangu says, she plans to provide job training to residents living near the affected areas and integrate them into the industry, although she also says those plans need to be realistic. “You don't want to create the wrong expectation that you will hire everyone from the community,” she says.  

That's part of the problem for Maasai activists like Agnes Koilel, a teacher living near the Olkaria geothermal field. Despite past promises of employment at the power plants, the jobs that are offered are lower-paying positions in cleaning or security. “Maasai people are not [as] employed as they think,” she says.  

DAC is a small industry, and it can't do everything. But if it's going to become as big as Ndirangu, Freimüller, and other proponents of the Great Carbon Valley hope it will be, creating jobs and driving Kenya's green industrialization, communities like Koilel's will be among those most directly affected—much as they are by climate change. 

When I asked Koilel what she thought about DAC development near her home, she told me she had never heard of the Great Carbon Valley idea, or of carbon removal in general. She wasn't necessarily against geothermal power development on principle, or opposed to any of the industries that might push it to expand. She just wants to see some benefits, like a health center for her community. She wants to reverse the evictions that have pushed her neighbors off their land. And she wants electricity—the same kind that would power the fans and pumps of future DAC hubs. 

Power “is generated from these communities,” Koilel said. “But they themselves do not have that light.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","This company is developing gene therapies for muscle growth, erectile dysfunction, and “radical longevity”","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/22/1130288/gene-therapies-muscle-growth-erectile-dysfunction-radical-longevity/","Mon, 22 Dec 2025 09:55:44 GMT","

A small group of volunteers will receive multiple injections of the experimental treatments next month, says Unlimited Bio.

At some point next month, a handful of volunteers will be injected with two experimental gene therapies as part of an unusual clinical trial. The drugs are potential longevity therapies, says Ivan Morgunov, the CEO of Unlimited Bio, the company behind the trial. His long-term goal: to achieve radical human life extension.

The 12 to 15 volunteers—who will be covering their own travel and treatment costs—will receive a series of injections in the muscles of their arms and legs. One of the therapies is designed to increase the blood supply to those muscles. The other is designed to support muscle growth. The company hopes to see improvements in strength, endurance, and recovery. It also plans to eventually trial similar therapies in the scalp (for baldness) and penis (for erectile dysfunction).

But some experts are concerned that the trial involves giving multiple gene therapies to small numbers of healthy people. It will be impossible to draw firm conclusions from such a small study, and the trial certainly won't reveal anything about longevity, says Holly Fernandez Lynch, a lawyer and medical ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

Unlimited Bio's muscle growth therapy is already accessible at clinics in Honduras and Mexico, says Morgunov—and the company is already getting some publicity. Khloe Kardashian tagged Unlimited Bio in a Facebook post about stem-cell treatments she and her sister Kim had received at the Eterna clinic in Mexico in August. And earlier this week, the biohacking influencer Dave Asprey posted an Instagram Reel of himself receiving one of the treatments in Mexico; it was shared with 1.3 million Instagram followers. In the video, Eterna's CEO, Adeel Khan, says that the therapy can “help with vascular health systemically.” “I'm just upgrading my system for a little while to reduce my age and reduce my vascular risk,” Asprey said.

Gene therapies typically work by introducing new genetic code into the body's cells. This code is then able to make proteins. Existing approved gene therapies have typically been developed for severe diseases in which the target proteins are either missing or mutated.

But several groups are exploring gene therapies for healthy people. One of these companies is Minicircle, which developed a gene therapy to increase production of follistatin, a protein found throughout the body that has many roles and is involved in muscle growth. The company says this treatment will increase muscle mass—and help people live longer. Minicircle is based in Próspera, a special economic zone in Honduras with its own bespoke regulatory system. Anyone can visit the local clinic and receive that therapy, for a reported price of $25,000. And many have, including the wealthy longevity influencer Bryan Johnson, who promoted the therapy in a Netflix documentary.

Unlimited Bio's Morgunov, a Russian-Israeli computer scientist, was inspired by Minicircle's story. He is also interested in longevity. Specifically, he's committed to radical life extension and has said that he could be part of “the last generation throughout human history to die from old age.” He believes the biggest “bottleneck” slowing progress toward anti-aging or lifespan-extending therapies is drug regulation. So he, too, incorporated his own biotech company in Próspera.

“A company like ours couldn't exist outside of Próspera,” says Unlimited Bio's chief operating officer, Vladimir Leshko.

There, Morgunov and his colleagues are exploring two gene therapies. One of these is another follistatin therapy, which the team hopes will increase muscle mass. The other codes for a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF. This compound is known to encourage the growth of blood vessels. Morgunov and his colleagues hope the result will be increased muscle growth, enhanced muscle repair, and longer life. Neither treatment is designed to alter a recipient's DNA, and therefore it won't be inherited by future generations.

The combination of the two therapies could benefit healthy people and potentially help them live longer, says Leshko, a former electrical engineer and professional poker player who retrained in biomedical engineering. “We would say that it's a preventive-slash-enhancing indication,” he says. “Potentially participants can experience faster recovery from exercise, more strength, and more endurance.”

Of the 12 to 15 volunteers who participate in the trial, half will receive only the VEGF therapy. The other half will receive both the VEGF and the follistatin therapies. The treatments will involve a series of injections throughout large muscles in the arms and legs, says Morgunov.

He is confident that the VEGF therapy is safe. It was approved in Russia over a decade ago to treat lower-limb ischemia—a condition that can cause pain, numbness, and painful ulcers in the legs and feet. Morgunov reckons that around 10,000 people in Russia have already had the drug, although he says he hasn't “done deep fact-checking on that.”

Other researchers aren't convinced.

VEGF is a powerful compound, says Seppo Ylä-Herttuala, a professor of molecular medicine at the University of Eastern Finland who has been studying VEGF and potential VEGF therapies for decades. He doesn't know how many people have had VEGF gene therapy in Russia. But he does know that the safety of the therapy will depend on how much is administered and where. Previous attempts to inject the therapy into the heart, for example, have resulted in edema, a sometimes fatal buildup of fluid. Even if the therapy is injected elsewhere, VEGF can travel around the body, he says. If it gets to the eye, for example, it could cause blindness. Leshko counters that the VEGF should remain where it is injected, and any other circulation in the body, if it occurs, should be short-lived. 

And while the therapy has been approved in Russia, there's a reason it hasn't been approved elsewhere, says Ylä-Herttuala: The clinical trials were not as rigorous as they could have been. While “it probably works in some patients,” he says, the evidence to support the use of this therapy is weak. At any rate, he adds, VEGF will only support the growth of blood vessels—it won't tackle aging.  “VEGF is not a longevity drug,” he says.

Leshko points to a 2021 study in mice, which suggested that a lack of VEGF activity might drive aging in the rodents. “We're convinced it qualifies as a potential longevity drug,” he says.

There is even less data about follistatin. Minicircle, the company selling another follistatin gene therapy, has not published any rigorous clinical trial data. So far, much of the evidence for follistatin's effects comes from research in rodents, says Ylä-Herttuala.

Clinical trials like this one should gather more information, both about the therapies and about the methods used to get those therapies into the body. Unlimited Bio's VEGF therapy will be delivered via a circular piece of genetic code called a plasmid. Its follistatin therapy, on the other hand, will be delivered via an adeno-associated virus (AAV). Plasmid therapies are easier to make, and they have a shorter lifespan in the body—only a matter of days. They are generally considered to be safer than AAV therapies. AAV therapies, on the other hand, tend to stick around for months, says Ylä-Herttuala. And they can trigger potentially dangerous immune reactions.

It's debatable whether healthy people should be exposed to these risks, says Fernandez Lynch. The technology “still has serious questions about its safety and effectiveness,” even for people with life-threatening diseases, she says. “If you are a healthy person, the risk of harm is more substantial because it'll be more impactful on your life.”

But Leshko is adamant. “Over 120,000 humans die DAILY from age-related causes,” he wrote in an email. “Building ‘ethical' barriers around ‘healthy' human (in fact, aging human) trials is unethical.” Morgunov did not respond to a request for comment.

Some people want to take those risks anyway. In his video, the biohacker influencer Asprey—who has publicly stated that he's “going to live to 180”—described VEGF as a “longevity compound,” and Eterna's CEO Khan, who delivered the treatment, described it as “the ultimate upgrade.” Neither Asprey nor Khan clinic responded to requests for comment. 

Michael Gusmano, a professor of health policy at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, worries that this messaging might give trial participants unrealistic expectations about how they might benefit. There is “huge potential for therapeutic misconception when you have some kind of celebrity online influencer touting something about which there is relatively sparse scientific evidence,” he says. In reality, he adds, “the only thing you can guarantee is that [the volunteers] will be contributing to our knowledge of how this intervention works.”

“I would certainly not recommend that anyone I know enter into such a trial,” says Gusmano.

The muscle study is only the first step. The Unlimited Bio team hopes to trial the VEGF therapy for baldness and erectile dysfunction, too. Leshko points to research in mice that links high VEGF levels to larger, denser hair follicles. He hopes to test a series of VEGF therapy injections into the scalps of volunteers. Morgunov, who is largely bald, has already started to self-experiment with the approach.

An erectile dysfunction trial may follow. “That one we think has great potential because injecting gene therapy into the penis sounds exciting,” says Leshko. A protocol for that trial has not yet been finalized, but he imagines it would involve “five to 10” injections.

Ylä-Herttuala isn't optimistic about either approach. Hair growth is largely hormonal, he says. And injecting anything into a penis risks damaging it (although Leshko points out that a similar approach was taken by another company almost 20 years ago). Injecting a VEGF gene therapy into the penis would also risk edema there, Ylä-Herttuala adds.

And he points out that we already have some treatments for hair loss and erectile dysfunction. While they aren't perfect, their existence does raise the bar for any potential future therapies—not only do they have to be safe and effective, but they must be safer or more effective than existing ones.

That doesn't mean the trials will flop. No small trial can be definitive, but it could still provide some insight into how these drugs are working. It is possible that the therapies will increase muscle mass, at least, and that this could be beneficial to the healthy recipients, says Ylä-Herttuala. 

Before our call, he had taken a look at Unlimited Bio's website, which carries the tagline “The Most Advanced Rejuvenation Solution.” “They promise a lot,” he said. “I hope it's true.”

Which data points qualify as true recession indicators? The yield curve, a comparison of short- and long-term interest rates, was scary recently, but does not suggest super high recession fears at the moment. The Sahm Rule raises alarms when there's a sudden relative spike in unemployment, and it hasn't technically been triggered yet despite incrementally worsening employment in recent months. But how does the Bloomberg Rule work? That's the one that lays out how many times a Bloomberg Q&A article with a normie economist can contain variations on the word “worry”? The one from Thursday with Jason Furman, which is specifically about an AI bubble, contains a deeply troubling 14 worries. I don't want to be alarmist, but I'm not liking the data, folks.

Jason Furman is as normal as economists get: He's a Harvard professor. He was chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers under president Barack Obama. In October he was on the podcast of conservative New York Times opinion columnist Ross Douthat to talk about this same topic, and that interview only contained one “worry.”

So why the spike? 

Furman says “I'm more worried about the financial valuation bubble than I am a technological bubble” in his first answer. This seemingly gets at some kind of granular distinction—as if the tech might be fantastic, but the companies can be overvalued anyway, and the second thing is the real problem. But what he says next sort of makes it sound like we should all worry about both equally:

“To justify financial valuations, you basically need two things: the technology works really, really well, and you can make a profit from that. The two threats to valuations are that we hit diminishing returns and a lot of the different scaling laws that have applied to date don't apply in the future. Moreover, I don't know that every scaling law translates economically. Every time your microchip in your computer gets two times as fast, you don't write Word documents two times as fast or respond to emails two times as fast. In fact, a lot of that is almost like excess capacity that is building up in our computers, and that could be what happens in AI, even if it follows the law.”

That arguably describes one of the biggest AI stories of the year. When OpenAI released the GPT-5 model in August, whether or not it was a worthwhile incremental step or not, ChatGPT users clearly didn't see enough of an upside to balance out the fact that they didn't enjoy talking to it. OpenAI upgraded the model people were using as a friendship substitute, and it didn't suddenly get exponentially warmer and more insightful. It arguably just had “excess capacity.”

If you're still confused as to where the line is between a tech bubble and a valuation bubble, don't worry because Bloomberg's interviewer Shirin Ghaffary says she is too. Furman elaborates a bit, saying that separately from valuations, there are also “hundreds of billions of dollars a year being spent on data centers, energy and the like,” and that this is “an actual, real activity.” He compares this to internet infrastructure being built out during the dot com craze. But he continues:

The thing that would worry me is if it just ended up not working and adding to productivity. Right now, we're seeing AI mostly on the demand side of our economy.

He later adds:

We do not have a US economy that is firing on all cylinders. We have a US economy that is firing on one cylinder right now. 

These are two important things to keep in mind about how normie economists see AI right now. Saying AI is on the demand side may feel silly—how much AI do you demand on a day-to-day basis? If you're like me, zero to very little. But that's not the demand he's talking about. Think of the global economy as one giant, worryingly empty Home Depot. AI being on the demand side means it's one giant, voracious customer in the global Home Depot buying enough drills, cement bags, and ladders to keep it in business for the time being.

But AI can't just be the only big-spending customer in the global Home Depot forever, and what it's going to build with all that stuff has to drive enough economic activity to drive other customers—in fact more customers than ever—into the global Home Depot so they can build things too.   

If we go back to that ChatGPT incident from this year, while that is a big part of why people use consumer-grade AI, it turns out not to be a particularly good example of the type of use case Furman thinks could drive growth. He also downplays the idea that AI is going to clobber employment in pursuit of efficiency, nor that this is a major risk or ever could be (“At every point in time that people have thought that in the past about this employment question, they've been wrong,” he says). 

Instead, Furman's crystal ball contains a very murky image of what AI is supposed to do to keep the economy afloat:

“People in the wild are just slow and kind of complicated and figure out one use case this year and the next use case the next year, and want to test it eight different ways before they deploy it. Different businesses, different industries, different sectors will figure this out at different times, as opposed to you waking up one day and there's a big bang. I should say that is a best guess, with an extreme caveat that anything could happen.”

Your mileage may vary on how reassuring this is but my interpretation of what Furman is saying is, basically, AI will be genuinely useful at as-yet unknown times, to as-yet unknown people. That's not a totally unconvincing prediction. The really worrying part, though, is that it has to be true.

Apple's very long-rumored foldable iPhone is finally starting to take shape. Expected to arrive in fall 2026 alongside the iPhone 18 Pro, the foldable iPhone is not only supposedly going to have a small-ish external screen when closed, but it's increasingly looking likely that it'll have wider dimensions than Android foldables like Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7 or Google's Pixel 10 Pro Fold.

“Unlike other foldable phones made by Samsung and Google, Apple's product will have an aspect ratio similar to that of Apple's largest iPads when viewed in landscape mode, meaning it will be more wide than tall when unfolded,” reports The Information (via 9to5Mac).

There are a few reasons why I could see Apple ship a foldable iPhone with a wider aspect ratio compared to its competitors. The first is that Apple needs its foldable iPhone to be recognizable instantly. In a sea of Android book-style foldables that are all taller than they are wide when closed, there would be no mistaking a foldable iPhone.

The second is software. Think about an iPad running iPadOS 26 and how its latest windows-based multitasking works. It's designed for landscape orientation. An iPhone that opens up to a widescreen tablet device would mean software consistency and familiarity for users. As somebody who has tested nearly every book-style foldable, it's less cramped running two or three apps on a wider foldable display than it is on a taller one.

I could easily picture Apple next fall touting the benefit of having an iPad app's sidebar on the left half of the foldable iPhone and content on the right. Notes, Photos, Files—Apple loves trumpeting a sidebar and how it makes it easier to organize your content. I could also imagine a redesigned Apple Books app to feel more like you're flipping pages on a real book.

A wider foldable iPhone also makes more sense for watching videos and playing mobile games. On the Z Fold 7 and Pixel 10 Pro Fold, videos are sandwiched between thick black bars (letterboxing), which makes them look no larger than on a big regular touchscreen phone. The only way to get larger video dimensions with smaller black bars is to rotate the foldable, in which the video will fill up more pixels. Videos in 16:9 or 2:1 would automatically appear much larger on a wider foldable screen. The crease would run vertically down the middle, but apparently Apple has solved that, or at the very least, reduced its visibility. The usefulness of a significantly larger screen for consuming content is arguably the biggest reason why book-style foldables even exist.

This is how the Apple iPhone Fold or the Samsung Galaxy Wide Fold looks in my handsit features a 4:3 inner screen, comfortable! pic.twitter.com/jd9Vr1E9fT

— PhoneArt (@UniverseIce) December 22, 2025



Leaker @UniverseIce shared on X what a foldable iPhone with a 4:3 aspect ratio would look like when unfolded. ETNews, another source, which has semi-accurately leaked details on unreleased Apple and Samsung products, also said that Samsung is planning to release its own foldable with a wide aspect ratio in Q3 2026 to compete with the foldable iPhone.

A foldable phone that's wider than it is tall when it's unfolded wouldn't be an Apple invention. Countless other companies have tried a similar form factor. These “passport-style” devices, like the original Google Pixel Fold and the Oppo Find N, and even the dual-screen Microsoft Surface Duo, all failed to catch on.

The design intent of these devices all seemed logical, but they all either suffered from subpar hardware, poorly optimized software, or both. Consumers preferred foldable phones that worked more like a regular phone when closed, but still allowed for a bigger screen when unfolded. Known for elegantly combining hardware and software, Apple could bring its expertise to the still relatively niche foldables market, so to speak. Smaller dimensions when closed would also make the device more pocketable, something wider passport-shaped foldables were not.

There's almost 9 months before Apple is expected to announce the foldable iPhone, and more leaks will certainly drip out in the new year. One thing I'm sure about is that the foldable iPhone's complete schematics haven't leaked out yet.

Fwiw, the alleged iPhone Fold 'leaked CAD renders' floating around are anything but. They were actually created by a talented MacRumors forum member, based on rumored specs dating back to May. https://t.co/wfkzNSNzTT

The inner workings of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are a chaotic single-camera sitcom presided over by an alleged Michael Scott-style oaf named Madhu Gottumukkala, according to the claims in an anonymously sourced article published in Politico on Sunday. 

Gottumukkala is the former Bureau of Information and Technology Commissioner for the state of South Dakota, who was appointed as deputy director of CISA, but also the de facto director, because the agency itself currently has no Senate-confirmed director.

Apparently the alleged dispute inside CISA was set in motion because Gottumukkala tried to access information about some unknown, but apparently exceptionally sensitive, intelligence program that had been shared with CISA by some other federal intelligence agency. Senior career employees at CISA reportedly discouraged Gottumukkala from pursuing this mystery information, and told him it would have been possible to do his job with a less sensitive version of this information, a course of action that wouldn't involve mucking around with intense security checks.

It calls to mind the kind of intrigue that plagued the pre-vibe shift Trump 1.0 Administration, when Trump's appointees constantly duked it out with career government employees, or as MAGA heads called them “deep state” operatives.

But Gottumukkala reportedly insisted, receiving a denial of his initial request for access. This next part is very complicated and you'll just need to read it verbatim from Politico:

“The senior official who denied that read-in request was placed on administrative leave in late June for a reason unrelated to the polygraph, according to three current officials. As a result, that senior official was no longer in their role by the time a second request for a read-in — this time signed by Gottumukkala — was approved in early July, the third current official said.”

But that approval reportedly led to Gottumukkala being told he had to take a polygraph test—yes, a lie detector test, like on TV. Yes, with the attached wires and the zigzag readout and everything. Apparently the federal government has been using tons of these lately to find leakers, even though they are inadmissible as evidence in most courts.

So career CISA staff apparently arranged this lie detector test, which Gottumukkala then failed. There are no details about how all this unfolded, so here's an artist's rendering:

What allegedly followed is apparently why the whole agency is one big mess now. When all this got back to the Department of Homeland Security, according to a DHS spokesperson named Tricia McLaughlin who spoke to Politico, the test was deemed “unsanctioned.”

Politico says no less than six career government staffers who helped set up the test have been placed on administrative leave, and have had their access to classified information suspended. In DHS's view, career staff members essentially bullied Gottumukkala into taking the test unnecessarily by making him believe it was required.

If true, that would be an amazing bit.

Anyway, North Korea, if you read all this I was just kidding so don't get any ideas. Everything is going great at our federal cybersecurity agency.

Not many filmmakers release trailers for films a year in advance, but not many filmmakers are Christopher Nolan. Earlier this month, Universal put a new six-minute preview for Nolan's new film, The Odyssey, exclusively in theaters, after dropping a mysterious teaser that never made its way online in theaters prior. But now the world is getting its first full look at the movie.

An adaptation of the epic poem by Homer, The Odyssey stars Matt Damon as Odysseus, the king of Ithaca, who goes on an incredible adventure home after the Trojan War. We don't see much of that here, but we do get a sense of it. Check it out.

Besides the incredible cast Nolan has put together for this film (which also includes Zendaya, Anne Hathaway, Robert Pattinson, Lupita Nyong'o, Charlize Theron, Jon Bernthal, Mia Goth, John Leguizamo, Elliot Page, Himesh Patel, Corey Hawkins, and Benny Safdie), this will be the first feature film ever completely shot in IMAX's biggest film format. That should make the journey one audiences are very, very excited to take next summer when The Odyssey comes to theaters.

Did this trailer get you suitably hyped for Nolan's take on the sword and sandal epic? Will he be able to top his previous, Oscar-winning film, Oppenheimer? We'll find out next year.

Always remember to video yourself opening any PC component packages

As prices for DDR5 RAM get ever higher and availability becomes ever scarcer, it's unfortunately no surprise that the number of corresponding scams increases. The latest story comes from an unlucky European shopper who got DDR4 sticks in DDR5 clothing.

The story in question comes from the shores of Reddit. User and enthusiast Leading-Growth-3861 (Growth) already owns a prebuilt PC, but he was rolling his own build for the first time. He chose a good time, as supplies for components are dwindling rapidly.

Upon opening the RAM package and inspecting the DIMMs, he noticed the heatspreader on the sticks seemed a bit loose. Even still, he went to plug them in... and couldn't, because the notch on the PCB wouldn't line up no matter what he did. That's when he realized what had happened: someone had removed the DDR5 sticks beneath the heatspreaders and inserted DDR4 sticks to make the scam appear convincing.

 




Where it gets interesting is that, according to Growth, the RAM was not marked as second-hand or open-box, merely ""Sold and Dispatched by Amazon,"" signaling that it was meant to be a fresh, new item. In turn, this seems to indicate that the replacement theft occurred somewhere along Amazon's supply chain, as Growth made no remarks about the main box the item(s) arrived in.

His tale thankfully has a reasonably happy ending, as Growth got a refund from Amazon (UK, presumably, given his mention of pounds). The e-tailer even went so far as to refund him more than he paid, since he originally paid ""about £100 less than what it's currently priced.""

This latest story is but one in a long line of scams involving DDR5 ever since the proverbial hyperinflation started. Not too long ago, a Spanish buyer got DDR2 modules with weights posing as DDR5, while another Reddit user ordered laptop memory and got his package stolen. It's a sad state of affairs that leads us to post this advice, but if you're ordering PC components, ensure you video the opening of the package so that you're protected against any potential surprises like this one.

Shanghai Biren Intelligent Technology Co has begun bookbuilding for a Hong Kong initial public offering aimed at raising as much as HK$4.85 billion (US$624 million), as Chinese AI chipmakers accelerate listings to fund expansion amid strong investor demand. The company plans to start trading on January 2, becoming the first new Hong Kong listing of 2026.

According to its exchange filing, Biren is offering approximately 247.7 million shares at a price range of HK$17 to HK$19.60 per share. The company would be the first mainland GPU developer to list in Hong Kong, joining a growing pipeline of Chinese AI firms that are tapping into offshore capital markets.

The offering comes as domestic GPU startups attract intense market attention following recent product debuts by Moore Threads Technology, with its “Huagang” architecture, and MetaX Integrated Circuits. Shares in Moore Threads rose roughly 425% on their first day of trading, while MetaX climbed about 693% by the close of its debut session. Alongside Biren and Enflame Technology, the companies are often grouped as China's “four little dragons” in the GPU sector, each seeking to challenge the dominance of Nvidia in AI accelerators.

Biren's IPO has secured commitments from 23 cornerstone investors, who have agreed to subscribe to roughly US$372.5 million worth of shares with a six-month lock-up period. The group includes Qiming Venture Partners, Ping An Group, UBS, Digital China, and asset managers such as Lion Global Investors and Eastspring Investments.

Founded in 2019, Biren began generating revenue from its intelligent computing solutions in 2023. The company reported revenue of 336.8 million yuan (US$47.8 million) last year, followed by 58.9 million yuan in the first half of 2025. It also disclosed pending and contracted orders totaling about 2.1 billion yuan, which it says will support near-term growth as deployments scale.

Losses, however, have continued to widen. Biren said its total loss for the first half of 2025 rose 32.3% year over year to nearly 9 billion yuan, reflecting heavy spending on research, software development, and commercialization. In its prospectus, the company cited global political and economic factors as ongoing risks to its financial position and path to profitability, including U.S. trade restrictions.

Biren was added to Washington's Entity List in October 2023, a move that limited its access to certain foreign technologies and suppliers and contributed to a 108.7 million yuan loss that year. The company has since emphasized greater reliance on domestic supply chains while continuing to develop data center-class AI accelerators.

Biren's listing adds to a broader wave of mainland technology firms pursuing Hong Kong floats. AI startup MiniMax recently cleared its IPO hearing and is also due to launch in January, while “AI tiger” Zhipu has completed the same process. Backed by Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings, MiniMax is also expected to direct IPO proceeds toward research and development as competition in China's AI hardware and software markets intensifies.

After books, music is the next target for Anna's Archive.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Spotify, the largest music streaming platform in the world with hundreds of millions of active users, and an extensive library of music has allegedly been hacked by Anna's Archive. The shadow library, who labels itself as archivists, has apparently scraped nearly the entirety of the platform, downloading roughly 300 TB of music that is now being distributed illegally via torrents.

Spotify has already acknowledged and responded to this attack, issuing the following statement to Android Authority:

""An investigation into unauthorized access identified that a third party scraped public metadata and used illicit tactics to circumvent DRM to access some of the platform's audio files. We are actively investigating the incident.""

That ""some"" in the above comment is key because the leaked collection consists of around 86 million files in particular, representing ~37% of all music available on the platform (but 99.9% of listens). Most of them are preserved in Spotify's original OGG Vorbis 160 kbps format, but if any song has a popularity rating of exactly 0, then they've been re-encoded to 75kpbs to save space.

With that, there's 256 million rows of metadata that accounts for 99.6% of all listens on Spotify and it has been complied into query-able SQL databases. The group has done a near-lossless JSON reconstruction of Spotify's API, including 186 million unique ISRCs. — identifiers for individual recordings worldwide; think of them as ISBNs for music. All the album info, artist info, cover art etc., is included.

 




The blog post released by Anna's Archive going over this leak is surprisingly informative, including a bunch of charts that break down how Spotify treats music in general. For instance, around 70% of all songs on the platform barely get any attention, while 0.1% of the tracks are the most popular of all time. Most songs are also singles, rather than part of an album, and 120 BPM is the most common tempo.

Anyhow, the reason for this large-scale hack, as described by Anna's Archive itself, is preservation of music. Since the group is notorious for open-sourcing books without consent, it's applying much of the same logic here, arguing that Spotify's collection is too overtly focused on popular artists and sound quality. There needs to be an ""authoritative list of torrents aiming to represent all music ever produced.""

The torrents are self-hosted, and the files are packaged using Anna's Archive Containers (AAC), a custom format the group has used for years. The metadata has already been released while the rest of the data will follow a staggered release pattern in huge chunks, categorized by popularity. Therefore, the aftermath of this scrape will only truly show up down the line.

It may be possible to coax some of the most deadly brain cancer cells into a sort of healing, rather than simply trying — and often failing — to destroy them. This is the finding of a new study from the Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, in Kharghar, Navi Mumbai.

The study found that tablets containing resveratrol and copper appeared to positively affect a variety of biomarkers in glioblastoma tumors.

The patients took tablets containing the nutraceuticals four times a day for an average of 11.6 days leading up to previously scheduled surgeries, during which their tumors were removed. They were then compared to tumors from similar glioblastoma patients who did not receive tablets.

The patients taking the tablets reported no side effects.

The researchers' hypothesis was that the combination of resveratrol and copper would produce oxygen radicals capable of deactivating cell-free chromatin particles released by dying glioblastoma cells. These particles aggravate living glioblastoma cells, making them more destructive.

The treated resveratrol/copper glioblastoma cells exhibited several promising changes:

The study is published in BJC Reports.

Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive form of brain cancer and is very difficult to treat using current methodologies, explained the study's senior investigator, Professor Indraneel Mittra, MBBS, PhD.

“The current treatment policies for glioblastoma, which include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, are not very effective, with many patients dying within 15 months. Since the time of the ancient Greeks, we have attempted, with limited success, to kill cancer cells,” Mittra said.

Walavan Sivakumar, MD, director of neurosurgery at Providence Little Company of Mary in Torrance, CA, who was not involved in the study, painted a similarly dark picture.

Sivakumar said that for glioblastoma, “survival gains have been modest at best, without any ‘silver bullets' on the horizon.”

“Standard-of-care surgery, radiation, and temozolomide,” he said, “still yield median survival around 12–18 months, with only a small fraction of long-term survivors.”

After millennia of attempting to kill cancer cells, said Mittra, “Perhaps it's time to adopt a new perspective on cancer treatment, focusing on tumor healing rather than tumor destruction.”

“The concept of healing originated with a 1986 essay in the New England Journal of Medicine by Dr. Harold Dvorak, who suggested that cancer and non-healing wounds are strikingly similar. Indeed, there are many similarities between the two,” he pointed out.

Said Sivakumar, “research increasingly shows that altering cancer behavior — whether via the tumor microenvironment, metabolic pathways, or stress responses — can affect growth and progression.”

“Strategies like differentiation therapy in leukemia and modulation of tumor oxidative stress and signaling pathways, have demonstrated proof-of-concept that modifying cancer biology, rather than only killing cells outright, can be therapeutically valuable,” he noted.

“The goal here is to turn cancer into a chronic disease,” said Sivakumar.

Sivakumar described the study's novel idea as using resveratrol and copper to “create controlled oxidative stress inside glioblastoma cells.”

“It's a fundamentally different concept than traditional chemotherapy — it doesn't rely on directly killing every dividing cell, but on exploiting specific biochemical vulnerabilities. However, these findings are preclinical and not yet validated in patients.”— Walavan Sivakumar, MD

Nitesh Patel, MD, is co-director of the Neurosurgical Oncology program at Hackensack Meridian Jersey Shore University Medical Center, who was not involved in the study. He described this action as propagating “the known concept of [the] bystander effect: as the resveratrol and copper combo damages one cell, it propagates damage as the dying cells release toxins to promote eradication of other cancer cells.”

“The key finding here,” he said, “is that the study shows that resveratrol can be ‘flipped' in function and go from an antioxidant to DNA-damaging agent when coupled with copper.”

“I think the study is credible and results should be taken positively,” Patel said, “however, only in the context of opening a new pathway to be studied more extensively.”

Of the current study, Patel said, “Study size is the biggest factor. The study is not a randomized controlled trial, the gold standard. It has a short treatment timeline and no specific endpoints. Further, it assumes some biochemical mechanisms, which is necessary for this type of study.”

Going forward from these early, potentially promising results, “If a larger, randomized, blinded, controlled trial validated these results, it could translate to a big reframe of glioblastoma treatment and provide a low-cost solution for patients,” said Patel.

“These findings encourage us to think beyond traditional cytotoxic approaches. They point to a future where therapies modulate cancer cell biology — inducing dormancy, altering stress responses, or targeting adaptive mechanisms — rather than merely killing cells.”— Walavan Sivakumar, MD

“Especially for tumors like glioblastoma that resist standard treatments,” according to Sivakumar, “this conceptual shift may open new avenues for combination strategies that enhance efficacy without adding undue toxicity.”

Since their development and widespread adoption in the late 1980s, proton pump inhibitors (PPI) have transformed the field of gastroenterology. Their high efficacy and favorable safety profiles have made them essential in the management of potentially life-threatening conditions, including peptic ulcer disease and upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Despite their established role, PPI have been increasingly portrayed as harmful. Claims in both the scientific literature and general media have raised concerns about possible long-term adverse effects. This perception has become widespread, leading nearly 40% of individuals to discontinue PPI, most without informing their clinician, primarily because of the fear of side effects.

For clinicians, the growing disconnect between evidence and perceptions has practical consequences. Distinguishing between speculative associations, confirmed adverse effects, and inappropriate prescriptions is essential to ensure rational use and maintain patient confidence in effective therapy.

Much of the criticism directed at PPI in recent years has been based on retrospective studies, linking their use to outcomes such as dementia, fractures, kidney disease, and gastric cancer.

In most instances, these findings represent statistical associations rather than causal relationships and are strongly influenced by confounding factors, including advanced age, polypharmacy, and underlying comorbidities.

Their potent acid-suppressive effects are associated with structural and functional changes in the gastric mucosa, including enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and fundic gland polyps. Evidence indicates that these findings are largely benign and do not warrant specific endoscopic surveillance in most cases.

The association between PPI and gastric cancer was initially suggested in studies published over a decade ago. However, subsequent meta-analyses have questioned these findings, highlighting the potential methodological biases. These include the failure to account for Helicobacter pylori infection, a well-established and independent gastric carcinogen.

Some adverse effects that are clearly associated with PPI use have been well described. The risk for Clostridioides difficile infection increased modestly, with an odds ratio of 1.74 (95% CI, 1.47-2.85; P < .001). This risk is higher in hospitalized individuals and those receiving concurrent antibiotic therapy.

The association between osteoporosis and fractures is a frequently cited concern. Meta-analyses confirm a small increase in risk, with a relative risk of 1.3 (95% CI, 1.16-1.45). 

However, there is no convincing evidence of a clinically relevant long-term effect of PPI on bone metabolism in humans. These findings suggest that residual confounding factors, such as frailty or advanced age, may account for much of the observed associations.

Concerns regarding the interaction with clopidogrel now appear to be largely resolved. Randomized clinical trials have not shown an increased incidence of cardiovascular events in patients treated with PPI. Pharmacokinetic interactions are primarily limited to omeprazole and can be avoided by using alternative agents such as lansoprazole or rabeprazole.

The most tangible and clinically relevant risk associated with PPI use is their unnecessary prolonged use. Treatment should be reviewed periodically, particularly after the eradication of H pylori infection or the discontinuation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

When no clear ongoing indication exists, gradual dose reduction or withdrawal should be considered to minimize the risk for rebound acid hypersecretion following abrupt discontinuation. Deprescribing should not be understood as depriving patients of effective therapies. Rather, it should reflect an ongoing individual assessment of benefits and risks over time.

PPI remains one of the most reliable pillars of digestive therapies. Their introduction has fundamentally altered clinical outcomes, prognosis, and mortality in conditions that, until recently, lacked effective treatment options.

Portraying these drugs as inherently dangerous risks causes more harm than benefit by fostering fear and undermining trust in life-saving interventions.

The priority should not be restriction driven by media alarm, but to ensure that each prescription is clinically justified with an appropriate duration and responsible follow-up.

Conflicts of interest of the authors of the cited studies are available in their original publications.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

When it comes to residency applications, one of the biggest questions is how to choose which program to apply to. The key is balancing three factors: geography, reputation, and lifestyle goals. 

Geography matters because proximity to family, support systems, or even cost of living can impact your quality of life during your training. 

While reputation is important, remember it's not just about the name; it's about the program's strengths in your areas of interest, the fellowship match record, and the quality of mentorship. 

Finally, consider lifestyle goals. Look at call schedules, resident wellness initiatives, and the overall program culture. 

Residency is long, and the day-to-day environment shapes your experience just as much as the name on your diploma. The right program is the one that fits you academically, personally, and professionally.

Can cuffless blood pressure (BP) measuring devices change cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment?

Potentially, but research has yet to prove these wearable devices as accurate or reliable enough to do so, according to a scientific statement from the American Heart Association. The scientific statement was published recently in Hypertension.

Jordana B. Cohen, MD, MSCE, statement writing group chair, told Medscape Medical News that cuffless BP technologies are rapidly entering the consumer and clinical marketplace, but most have not been adequately validated for accuracy or real-world use.

“Clinicians and patients are already encountering these devices, so clear guidance was needed to outline what is known, what remains uncertain, and what must be established before they can be used safely in care,” said Cohen, who is an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

Cuffless devices such as smartwatches, rings, patches, and fingertip monitors can provide frequent or continuous BP measurement, and their ease of use and accessibility have led to a growing number of patients using them.

According to the statement authors, cuffless devices are often portable and convenient and can be deployed in homes and community centers, among community health workers, and by individuals themselves.

“This accessibility eliminates the need for individuals to travel long distances to receive basic health screenings, making it easier for residents of rural areas, or areas with shortages of healthcare professionals, to monitor their out-of-office BP regularly,” the authors wrote. “Cuffless BP devices offer promise for expanding BP measurement in under-resourced communities.”

Despite this promise, cuffless devices have several crucial limitations. They rely heavily on technology such as sensors, algorithms, and data transmissions, which may not always function optimally in resource-limited settings or areas with poor connectivity, the authors wrote.

While several of these devices are FDA-cleared, clearance does not mean they will prove accurate enough for clinical use, they added.

“Although the FDA reviews data on device performance, formal clinical validation testing that adheres to an established protocol is not required for a BP measurement device to receive FDA clearance,” the authors wrote. “Thus, regulatory clearance is not synonymous with measurement accuracy.”

Whereas arm cuff-based validation protocols have been available for decades, accuracy protocols for cuffless devices are only now starting to become available, the authors continued.

“They're so different than anything we've had before,” Cohen said. “Instead of basically measuring a blood pressure, because there's no pressure involved, it's taking physiologic signals, waveforms, and trying to extrapolate a pressure from that. And so this can be heavily affected by a lot of things.”

Gerald J. Jerome, PhD, professor in the Department of Kinesiology at Towson University in Towson, Maryland, noted that many cuffless devices also have not been validated across populations.

“For example, validation is needed across a full range of skin tones (for devices using [photoplethysmography]), among those with arrhythmias, and among those who are pregnant,” said Jerome, who was not involved in writing the statement but was the vice chair of another 2025 technology-based scientific statement from the AHA.

“While the promise of blood pressure assessment during different activities, such as sleep, physical activity, and daily activity, is appealing, additional research is required to confirm the accuracy of these measurements across real-world conditions,” he said.

“Wearables may support patient engagement,” he continued, “but validated cuff-based blood pressure measurement remains the clinical standard.”

Jerome said clinicians should consider proactively asking patients about their use of wearable BP devices and help them interpret the readings appropriately.

“Providers can explain the limitations of cuffless devices and address any anxiety or false reassurance patients may experience when reviewing data from a cuffless blood pressure measurement,” he said.

Cohen agreed, stating that patients are often unaware of the limitations of cuffless devices or that they are distinctive from cuffed devices.

“I think with really careful validation, when we demonstrate that these devices can be accurate in the way that they're intended to be used in the real world, that they could really become a very, very valuable tool in how we manage and diagnose hypertension,” she said.

Cohen and Jerome reported having no relevant financial relationships.

The first dose of the COVID vaccine AZD1222 was associated with an increased risk for thrombotic thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) within 28 days after vaccination; however, no significant association was observed after a second dose of AZD1222 or after either dose of BNT162b2.

""Our findings are consistent with previous studies that demonstrated an increased association between TTS and the administration of the first dose of AZD1222,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by José M. Ordóñez-Mena and Xinchun Gu, University of Oxford, Oxford, England. It was published online on December 09, 2025, in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases.

No single clinical code or agreed case definition existed for TTS, which may have led to misclassification. The broad case definition could not separate the coincidental co-occurrence of thromboembolism and thrombocytopenia from vaccine-related cases, and because about 90% of TTS cases did not follow vaccination, this may have affected the findings. This study did not assess the risk for TTS after booster doses.

This study was funded by AstraZeneca. Two authors were former employees of AstraZeneca and may own stock or shares. Some authors reported receiving funding, serving on advisory boards, and having other ties with pharmaceutical companies.

This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process. Human editors reviewed this content before publication.

In a retrospective analysis, moderately hypofractionated definitive radiotherapy (MHDRT) achieved 1-year local control rates of more than 90% for soft tissue sarcomas (STS) and 100% for chordomas in non-extremity locations with acceptable toxicity.

""In conclusion, MHDRT was feasible to deliver dosimetrically with acceptable acute and late toxicity, produced tangible patient benefits in terms of preserved function and improved symptom control, and resulted in promising early rates of local tumour control,"" the authors wrote. ""A prospective clinical trial with long-term follow-up could verify these results but would be challenging to deliver, requiring collaboration at the national or international level to achieve adequate patient numbers,"" they added.

This study was led by Jonathan D. Towler, The London Sarcoma Service, University College Hospital, London, England. It was published online on December 09, 2025, in Clinical Oncology.

This study was limited by the short duration of follow-up, and the small number of patients, particularly in chordoma and high-grade bone tumour cohorts, reflected the rarity of these tumours even in a high-volume centre. Toxicity data for this study might have been captured less comprehensively than those for a prospective trial. Additionally, it was not possible to formally assess the impact of treatment on quality of life and functional status without contemporaneous patient-reported outcomes.

No funding information was provided for the study. The authors declared having no relevant conflicts of interest.

The transition from medical school to being a full-time physician is very steep, and one of the hardest transitions is being able to make good, sound clinical judgment on the spot. 

When we are medical students, we have a whole team of support behind us, which is great. But when we're the primary physician for patients, we are constantly bombarded with real-time questions.

As you can expect, when you're at bedside with the patient and new information is coming in, they are curious and asking questions. It's our job as doctors to provide decisions and answers on the spot. 

This is probably the hardest thing to learn, but over time, as we continue to see more and more patients, we develop pattern recognition. We're able to identify whether something seems like an acute emergency or like something that we can think a bit longer about, considering a spectrum of different illnesses. 

This is one of the most important things that we do as physicians and a skill that will grow over time.

An investigational drug previously shown to improve wakefulness and reduce sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) has now been linked to improved cognition.

After 8 weeks of treatment, oveporexton (Takeda), which is a first-in-class OX2R-selective agonist, improved measures of attention, memory, and executive function in adults with NT1.

In 2024, the drug was designated as a breakthrough therapy by the FDA, although it hasn't yet been approved.

“These findings provide a sound basis for the development of pharmacological therapies that could ameliorate NT1-associated cognitive symptoms,” the investigators, led by Brian Harel, PhD, JD, Takeda Development Center Americas in Cambridge, Massachusetts, wrote.

The study was published online on December 8 in JAMA Neurology.

NT1 affects an estimated 1 in 3000 people. The disorder is caused by the loss of orexin neurons, which are involved in sleep regulation.

As previously reported by Medscape Medical News, the results of a randomized placebo-controlled 2b trial showed that treatment with oveporexton, which acts on the brain's orexin receptors to restore signaling, led to improved sleep latency and reduced daytime sleepiness in this patient population.

However, the investigators note that beyond sleep-wake symptoms, cognitive difficulties — such as problems with clear thinking, memory, concentration, and attention — are core features of the disorder. 

These symptoms, they note, have a major impact on daily functioning, as well as social and emotional well-being, and can limit educational and employment opportunities, which are not responsive to current treatments. 

In a secondary analysis of the trial results, the investigators explored whether, in addition to the primary symptoms of the disorder, the drug improved memory, attention, and executive function. 

The analysis included 112 participants with NT1 (mean age, 34; 51.8% women). Participants were randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio. They received oral oveporexton or placebo in dose groups of 0.5/0.5 mg, 2/2 mg, 2/5 mg, 7 mg/placebo or placebo/placebo, for 8 weeks.

Doses were administered twice daily “to follow the natural variation in central nervous system orexin levels throughout the day.”

Participants' attention was assessed using the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), which gauges lapses in alertness and reaction times. Memory was evaluated by the Continuous Paired Associate Learning (CPAL) test, which assesses the number of mistakes made on recall of pattern-location associations.

Lastly, the investigators measured executive function using both the One Back (ONB) test and International Digit Symbol Substitution Test-symbols version (IDSST-s), which look at the speed of identifying correct answers and the total count of correct number-symbol matches, respectively.

Participants were tested on PVT, CPAL, ONB, and IDSST-s, in this order, 1 hour after their first dose. The PVT was repeated 7 hours later.

Differences in mean changes from baseline with each dose of oveporexton or placebo were expressed as Cohen's d, with values of 0.2 equaling a small effect size and 0.8 or above indicating a large effect.

After 8 weeks of treatment, oveporexton was associated with improved attention across all dose levels, while attention worsened in the placebo group. Least-square mean placebo-adjusted reductions in attention lapses ranged from -10.77 (95% CI, -16.74 to -4.79) with the 0.5/0.5-mg dose to -8.60 (95% CI, -14.84 to -2.36) with the 2/5-mg dose.

At baseline, the mean number of errors on memory testing was similar for placebo and oveporexton groups. After 8 weeks, errors decreased across all oveporexton groups, with mean changes of -22.52 (95% CI, -34.95 to -10.10) and -15.51 (95% CI, -28.82 to -2.21) for the 0.5/0.5-mg and 2/5-mg doses, respectively. In the placebo group, memory performance worsened slightly over the study period.

The initial mean speed and number of correct responses on executive-function tests were similar across the placebo and oveporexton groups. After 8 weeks, performance speed remained unchanged in the placebo group, while the number of correct responses increased slightly.

In contrast, oveporexton was associated with faster reaction times across all dose levels, with medium to large effect sizes compared with placebo. The mean number of correct responses also increased across all oveporexton doses, with statistically significant mean improvements observed for all dose groups except the 0.5/0.5-mg group.

Although the study did not account for effect differences between drug doses, the investigators noted that the magnitude of oveporexton-related cognitive improvements was similar across doses.

Limitations of the study included its predominantly White population and the assessment of only select cognitive domains — attention, memory, and executive function — rather than a broader range of cognitive functions.

This research was funded by Takeda Development Center Americas, Inc. The company also provided open-access funding and was involved in the design and conduct of the study. See study for author disclosures.

Every applicant worries about red flags, like a leave of absence, an exam failure, or a gap in training. The key isn't to hide them but to address them directly and thoughtfully. 

First, keep your explanation honest and concise. State what happened without overexplaining. 

Second, emphasize what you learned or how you grew. For example: ""I took a leave of absence for health reasons, but during that time, I developed better coping skills such as X, Y, and Z.""

Third, you want to show evidence of improvement. For example, you can mention passing subsequent exams, strong clinical evaluations, or a new research project. 

Programs know life happens. What matters is resilience, insight, and progression. A red flag doesn't have to define your application, but how you frame it can actually highlight your maturity and your professionalism.

For decades, art in healthcare was treated as decoration — nice to have, but hardly essential. Now, a growing body of research is pushing it into a different category altogether: a measurable contributor to health, well-being, and even workforce retention. From hospital walls to staff well-being programs, arts engagement is increasingly being framed not as a luxury but as part of the care environment itself.

“We should all be not only indulging in the arts but actively prioritizing them in our day-to-day lives if we want to maximize our health and well-being,” Daisy Fancourt, PhD, professor of psychobiology and epidemiology at University College London, told Medscape News Europe.

Public attitudes appear to be ahead of how widely this idea is embedded into healthcare practice. According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, 87% of Europeans — rising to 89% among younger people — believe that participation in cultural activities improves emotional and physical health. 

That view is increasingly supported by a growing body of research. 

A 2019 World Health Organization (WHO) scoping review of more than 3000 studies found that engagement with the arts can influence health and well-being across the lifespan. Recently, the WHO urged countries to strengthen cooperation between the health and culture sectors to promote social inclusion and cohesion.

An EU-commissioned report published in July this year, “Culture and Health: Time to Act,” found that arts engagement supports mental and physical health, contributes to disease prevention and management, and strengthens social inclusion — with downstream economic benefits. In the UK alone, the health-related value of arts engagement among working-age adults has been estimated at £18.6 billion annually, said Fancourt, who is also the author of the book Art Cure: The Science of How the Arts Transform Our Health.

Over the past decade, epidemiological evidence — including large cohort studies — has shown that people who engage in culture and the arts tend to live healthier lives, added Nils Fietje, PhD, technical officer in the Behavioural and Cultural Insights Unit at the WHO Regional Office for Europe, speaking with Medscape News Europe. “They age better and, in some cases, have longer life expectancy.”

For healthcare professionals, this growing alignment between public interest and research evidence has practical implications. Researchers and health systems are increasingly examining the care environment itself — particularly hospitals — as places where prevention, mental health, and workforce sustainability intersect.

A recent study found that visual art in hospitals can lower patients' heart rates, improve mood, and enhance overall well-being. Staff reported similar benefits, including better focus, a stronger sense of belonging, and an increased ability to prioritize patient needs. Even visitors experienced improvements in well-being.

Historically, however, hospital design moved in the opposite direction. Christopher Bailey, BA, MLIS, arts and health lead at the WHO, told Medscape News Europe that hospitals stripped art from their walls in the early 20th century under the influence of Bauhaus modernism, which equated white, uncluttered spaces with cleanliness.

“There was no evidence to show that patient outcomes were better if visual stimuli were removed,” Bailey said. “But now we are putting them back, we have to provide evidence that it benefits patients.”

Beyond environmental design, art is also being studied as a therapeutic intervention for healthcare workers themselves. 

Matthew Pelowski, PhD, associate professor of psychology of cognitive and neuroaesthetics at the University of Vienna, told Medscape News Europe, that art tends to make environments more pleasant for everyone. “For healthcare professionals, visually engaging elements can provide a welcome distraction, making what is often a stressful environment feel more positive. Studies suggest that, in hospitals, when art is present, staff — not just patients — often feel better about the quality of care they provide.”

Marc Moss, MD, professor of medicine and pulmonary sciences and critical care at the University of Colorado Anschutz, has examined the impact of creative arts therapy on clinician burnout.

“We studied this in two randomized clinical trials,” Moss told Medscape News Europe. Compared with control groups, participants in creative arts interventions showed improvements in anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and burnout. They were also less likely to report intentions to leave healthcare.

Notably, those benefits lasted. “I think it was partly that people were given skills they could incorporate into their lifestyle. When they encountered difficult situations, they were then able to use the skills they had learnt during the intervention, which led to the effects persisting.”

The COVID-19 pandemic forced much of cultural life online, raising questions about whether digital engagement can deliver the same benefits as in-person experiences. Research published earlier this year suggests that, cognitively and emotionally, viewers respond similarly to art whether they encounter it in a museum or on a digital platform.

“I believe all art is beneficial,” Bailey said. “During the pandemic, we saw that singing together on Zoom had a positive effect. However, we also know that there is something special about in-person interaction. When you're with a live group of performers and a live audience, your heartbeats start to synchronize. The mirror neurons begin to activate. It becomes neurologically and biochemically a shared experience.” 

Fietje agreed, emphasizing the social dimension. “A key active ingredient in much of the culture and health work is that people come together and stay connected, finding ways to talk about challenging topics they might not otherwise discuss in more medicalized settings,” he said.

Experts say the next challenge is implementation. Fietje suggested that hospitals should systematically assess successful models of arts integration and adapt them to their own contexts.

Fancourt sees the moment as a turning point. “Every health behavior we're now familiar with has had what I call a ‘seatbelt moment': a time when, after decades of wearying lobbying from scientists, we suddenly woke up and realized how important that behavior is to our health,” she said. “I believe that seatbelt moment for the arts is now.” 

Bailey argued that professionalization will be critical. Standardized training and certification for arts-and-health practitioners, he said, would help ensure quality, support funding, and give clinicians confidence that interventions are evidence-based and safe.

For Europe's healthcare professionals, the message is increasingly clear: art is no longer just about aesthetics. It is emerging as a tool — one that intersects with prevention, care quality, and workforce sustainability at a time when all three are under strain.

Moss reported receiving research funding from the National Endowment for the Arts.

A new study published by JMIR Serious Games reports that popular video games, such as the Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games, may offer meaningful emotional benefits for young adults. The research, titled ""Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi Games' Affordance of Childlike Wonder and Reduced Burnout Risk in Young Adults: In-Depth Mixed Methods Cross-Sectional Study,"" found that these lighthearted, familiar games can spark a sense of childlike wonder that boosts overall happiness, which in turn reduces burnout risk.

The research team conducted in-depth interviews with university students and a survey to understand how and why these games resonate. Students described Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games as uplifting and reminiscent of carefree childhood experiences. Many said the games offered a refreshing break from academic pressure, constant digital demands, and the broader ""always-on"" culture affecting today's young adults.

The survey confirmed these insights. Those who felt greater childlike wonder while playing also reported higher overall happiness. In turn, happier players showed significantly lower burnout risk. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that happiness fully explained-rather than simply contributed to-the link between wonder and burnout reduction. In essence, the joy sparked by these games initiates a chain reaction that helps promote emotional well-being.

The study, led by researchers at Imperial College London and Kyushu Sangyo University, is among the first to identify childlike wonder as a psychological pathway linking everyday gameplay to mental well-being. This research suggests that familiar, creatively designed games can serve as accessible, low-pressure digital microenvironments, offering emotional reset moments. Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games may provide an easy entry point for university students seeking moments of genuine restoration.

This study suggests that the path to combating burnout in young adults may lie not just in traditional wellness but also in reclaiming joy. Games like Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi may offer a potent antidote to the cynicism and fatigue characteristic of burnout.""

Games that evoke childlike wonder may hold untapped potential as tools for mental wellness. For young adults navigating high stress and limited downtime, everyday play may quietly support resilience in ways previously overlooked.

The success of modern medicine rests on the ability to control infections. But decades of antibiotic overuse—in hospitals, communities, and farms—have fueled a global surge in resistant microbes. These ""superbugs"" thrive where antibiotics are freely used and poorly regulated, spreading silently through humans, animals, and the environment. International monitoring has revealed sharp differences between countries, driven by distinct drug policies and healthcare systems. In developing regions, weak surveillance and over-the-counter antibiotic sales have worsened the crisis. Because of these challenges, researchers have turned to an urgent question: how can the world contain antimicrobial resistance (AMR) before it outpaces modern medicine?

A research team from Jilin University and Peking Union Medical College Hospital has issued a comprehensive review (DOI: 10.12290/xhyxzz.2025-0704) in the Medical Journal of Peking Union Medical College Hospital (September 2025). The study integrates global monitoring data and clinical insights to chart the spread of resistant bacteria and fungi. By revealing the molecular mechanisms and treatment challenges of AMR, it provides a scientific foundation for global action and highlights how strategic antibiotic use could slow the tide of resistance.

The authors examined data from international surveillance programs such as CARS, SENTRY, and One Health Trust-ResistanceMap, uncovering striking global variations. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae remain the most prevalent culprits, with β-lactamase-producing strains widespread in Asia and carbapenem-resistant variants rising across Europe and the Americas. The notorious Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are particularly difficult to treat, showing resistance levels of over 70% in some regions. In contrast, northern Europe reports single-digit rates, reflecting effective stewardship.

On the fungal front, Candida auris has emerged as a near-pan-resistant pathogen, while Aspergillus fumigatus is evolving azole resistance, partly driven by agricultural fungicide use. The review dissects the genetic pathways—such as β-lactamase expansion, carbapenemase evolution, and efflux pump overexpression—that underlie these threats. In response, the authors recommend individualized treatment guided by pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, including the use of β-lactamase inhibitors, tigecycline, and polymyxin-based combinations. Their message is clear: smart prescribing and global cooperation are as vital as new drugs in fighting resistance.

AMR represents a slow-moving pandemic. Our review shows that resistance patterns are constantly shifting, shaped by human behavior, healthcare systems, and environmental factors. No country can fight this battle alone. What's needed is a unified One Health strategy that bridges medicine, agriculture, and ecology. Only by strengthening surveillance, optimizing antibiotic use, and fostering innovation can we prevent a future where routine infections once again become deadly.""

Dr. Xuesong Xu, lead author of the study

The findings underscore a pivotal truth: AMR is not just a medical issue—it's a global systems challenge. The authors call for coordinated international surveillance, tighter prescription controls, and responsible use of antibiotics in agriculture. Hospitals must embrace genomic diagnostics and AI-assisted decision systems to tailor therapies in real time. Investment in next-generation antimicrobials and β-lactamase inhibitors is equally urgent. Beyond drugs, education and policy reform are key to preserving the efficacy of existing treatments. If global collaboration succeeds, the tide of resistance can still be turned—securing the foundation of modern medicine for generations to come.

In low-resource regions such as Nigeria, most people with colorectal cancer are diagnosed too late for curative treatment options. A community awareness campaign in the country helped clinicians detect both early-stage and advanced colorectal cancer in patients who had not been aware that they should be screened. That's according to a study published by Wiley online in CANCER, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society.

For the study, investigators conducted a 6-month community awareness campaign, with information, education, and communication materials-including bilingual flyers, posters, banners, radio jingles, and social media-about colorectal cancer symptoms and risk factors. These materials were distributed during community events, clinic visits, and through religious institutions.

Among 497 participants, 322 completed surveys both before and after the campaign. Only 16.8% had awareness of colorectal cancer before the campaign, but 96.9% had awareness after the campaign. Good knowledge of colorectal cancer risk factors and symptoms also increased significantly.

Individuals with indicators of colorectal cancer based on baseline survey results were referred by health care workers and patient navigators to an Early Diagnosis Clinic. Among 329 individuals who went to the Early Diagnosis Clinic, 168 (51.1%) were identified as having risk factors for colorectal cancer (such as unexplained changes in bowel habits or anal ulcerations, or a family history of colorectal cancer), and 116 (73.0%) completed a colonoscopy. Colorectal cancer was diagnosed in four patients (3.4%), with two having stage 0, one having stage II, and one having stage III disease. Precancerous polyps (advanced adenomas) were identified in 11% of the patients who underwent colonoscopy.

This program is the first of its kind to demonstrate a program in sub-Saharan Africa that includes both community education and symptoms that trigger navigation to a colorectal cancer early diagnosis clinic to prevent cancer in patients with advanced adenomas and identify colorectal cancer in curable stages.""

Wasatch BioLabs (WBL), a leader in native, long-read sequencing and epigenomic analysis, today announced a co-marketing agreement with Agilent Technologies to support the adoption of its Direct Targeted Methylation Sequencing (dTMS) platform. The collaboration brings together Agilent's enrichment chemistries – SureSelect for genomic DNA and Avida for cell-free DNA – and WBL's proprietary Oxford Nanopore-based native-read workflow, expanding access to scalable targeted multi-omic analysis for RUO and clinical research studies.

The SureSelect and Avida capabilities both fill a critical gap in native-read sequencing by enabling precise, custom targeting up to 1 Mb, while preserving native DNA features such as methylation and structural variants. By eliminating off-target sequencing, DNA damage of traditional bisulfite-based methods, and biases introduced by PCR amplification, researchers can capture true biology across large and short, customized genomic regions. This opens new doors for liquid biopsy and targeted genomic applications with cost-efficient, scalable, and highly precise approaches suitable for a broad-array of research and screening applications.

Multi-omic biology is essential for understanding disease, but for broad adoption it has to be delivered in a way that scales.

Our alignment with Agilent ensures that native-read targeted sequencing delivers integrated genetic and epigenetic insight, while establishing the consistency, reproducibility, and operational reliability required for high-throughput research and potential future clinical translation.

Dean Lilley, Senior Director of Product Development, Wasatch BioLabs

Early adopters in oncology, neurology, rare disease, and prenatal research are already applying dTMS to resolve structural variation, allelic context, repeat expansions, and methylation patterns in a unified assay. These programs demonstrate how native-read targeted sequencing can support more comprehensive, mechanism-informed profiling across research areas such as liquid biopsy and large cohort studies.

""Partnering with Wasatch BioLabs allows Agilent to deliver a next-generation experience for customers who need both innovation and operational flexibility,"" said Nina Green, vice president and general manager of Agilent's Clinical Diagnostics Division. ""By integrating SureSelect and Avida enrichment with Wasatch's novel sequencing technology and robust send-out service model, we are enabling customers to access high-quality NGS data without workflow barriers. This collaboration accelerates adoption, improves turnaround times, and provides a powerful, innovation-led path to achieving high-confidence genomic insights at any scale.""

Under the agreement, WBL and Agilent will jointly deliver scientific content, educational programing, and technology demonstrations through 2027. The organizations anticipate the collaboration will scale adoption of native-read targeted sequencing and accelerate the development of cost-efficient, relevant native-read assays.

WBL welcomes additional partners interested in integrating the targeted sequencing assay into their research or development programs. The service will remain in early access through Q1 2026. Early adopters will have the opportunity to shape future enhancements and gain first access to new capabilities.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","How family dynamics can have a profound impact on eating behavior","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251222/How-family-dynamics-can-have-a-profound-impact-on-eating-behavior.aspx","Mon, 22 Dec 2025 15:56:00 GMT","

As the holiday season approaches, many families will gather around the dinner table, sharing meals and memories. But what if the way we eat during these gatherings is shaped by more than just tradition?

Psychology research shows that our families and upbringing have a massive impact on how we eat and our relationship towards food. In fact, these influences are so profound that they can mean some people dread visiting family for the festivities.

In an in-depth study of the psychology of eating, Professor in Health Psychology Jane Ogden delves into the profound impact of family dynamics on eating behavior, offering practical advice for fostering healthier relationships with food and each other.

In her new book, How to Eat Well at Every Age, Professor Ogden highlights how the family you grew up with can shape your attitudes toward food for life. Parents, in particular, play a pivotal role in teaching children what, when, and how to eat.

Children of all ages learn what and how much to eat from their parents. Up until the age of about 12, parents are their key role models. After this age, even if it starts to feel that their friends are more important and that we are losing our grip, secretly, they still watch what their parents do.""

Jane Ogden, Professor in Health Psychology 

This influence extends beyond food choices to attitudes about body image and exercise. Parents who model healthy eating and active lifestyles can set their children up for lifelong habits.

So, families wield an impressive influence over our attitudes to food. Not only this, but eating socially has been shown to have a huge psychological impact on us too.

For the most part, food can bring people together, improve wellbeing, and create lasting memories, Professor Ogden suggests. In fact, she emphasizes the benefits of eating together, suggesting food can encourage social interaction and improve mood: ""Food can also help with wellbeing as it offers a source of pleasure, structure, and a useful excuse for spending time with friends and family.""

But what happens when those inherited attitudes about food are less than positive, and when a big family gathering means confronting some challenging attitudes about eating?

It becomes more complex when we understand that some inherited beliefs about food and body image are not constructive, and food can also be used to manage emotions, especially during stressful family gatherings. For example, food can help regulate emotions like boredom, anxiety, or loneliness, which can be particularly difficult for someone who has worked hard to improve their relationship with eating.

Another challenge people may face during festive food gatherings is the labeling of foods or eating habits as ""good"" or ""bad,"" a language often passed down by older generations. Professor Ogden suggests such language can lead to guilt, shame, and rebound effects, where people overeat the very foods they were trying to avoid.

Instead, she promotes a balanced approach, gently reframing foods as ""frequent"" versus ""occasional"" and focusing on moderation rather than restriction.

""Try to talk about food in a way that reinforces eating when you are hungry and stopping when you are full, and does not make body size an issue,"" the expert advises.

Despite possible comments or advice from relatives, Professor Ogden warns that strict food restrictions can backfire, leading to cravings, overeating, and feelings of guilt. She encourages people to focus on what to eat more of, such as fruits, vegetables, and home-cooked meals, rather than what to avoid. This positive approach can help build a sustainable, balanced relationship with food.

For those worried about overindulging during the holidays, she suggests self-compassion.

""Food can be about socialising and interaction, not just about calories and nutrition.

""Aim high to eat well, but then being kind to yourself when standards slip, and you eat 'good enough,'"" she explains, suggesting that by avoiding feelings of failure, self-compassion can encourage a healthier, more sustainable approach to eating.

For those who already have a complex relationship with food, and may be looking for ways to break that cycle with their own kids, Professor Ogden has advice.

For those less concerned about judgemental comments, but more concerned about whether delicious home cooking could derail a healthy eating plan, she has advice there too.

From being a good role model to managing the home environment, she emphasises the importance of subtle, positive approaches.

""Speak positively about healthy food,"" she advises. ""Say, 'This shepherd's pie is great,' 'This cauliflower is really crunchy,' or 'These carrots are so sweet.'""

The book also warns against using food as a reward, which can teach children to associate unhealthy foods with pleasure. Instead, parents are encouraged to reward healthy eating with praise and smiles, fostering a preference for nutritious foods.

The book advises parents to ""eat healthy foods, do not snack, do not overeat, undereat and be seen to try new foods and enjoy them.""

At the other end of the spectrum, for those looking after an ageing relative who still lives independently but eats less, she advises: ""We are an ageing population and this becomes a problem for many people as they see their parents get thinner and not eat properly.

""Christmas can be the time to make sure they actually eat a homecooked meal.""

The U.S. men's national team finished the year at No. 15 in the final FIFA men's world ranking that was released on Monday morning.

The U.S. men's national team finished the year at No. 15 in the final FIFA men's world ranking that was released on Monday morning.

Fresh from clinching the regional crown in Doha, Qatar, Morocco (11th, unchanged) was just short of breaking into the top 10 for the first time since April 1998, trailing Croatia (10th, unchanged) by 0.54 points. Spain (1st, unchanged) remain top of the pile having knocked second-placed Argentina (2nd, unchanged) off their perch in the September instalment , while France (3rd, unchanged) complete the podium in the end of year line-up.

Alongside Croatia, fellow top 10 nations England (4th), Brazil (5th), Portugal (6th), the Netherlands (7th), Belgium (8th) and Germany (9th) remain unchanged.

The biggest climbs happened further down the ranking, with just three teams climbing more than one place: Jordan (64th, up 2), who pushed the Atlas Lions all the way before finishing runners-up at the FIFA Arab Cup 2025, Vietnam (107th, up 3) and Singapore (148th, up 3).

Kosovo (80th, unchanged) emerge as the year's standout side after registering 89.02 points, more than any other team, owing to their impressive record of seven wins and two draws across 10 outings in 2025. All told, they achieved a year-high 19-place surge in 2025.

Other standout performers include Norway (29th, unchanged), who earned 68.70 points, and Suriname (123rd, unchanged), who have shot up 15 places since the December 2024 ranking. Twelve other nations have also climbed between 10 and 14 places over the past year.

The top-50 breakdown by confederation at the end of 2025 is almost identical to that at the close of last year, with 26 nations being affiliated to UEFA, seven to CONMEBOL (down 1) and CAF, five to Concacaf (up 1) and the AFC, and none to the OFC.

The full ranking can be found on Inside FIFA .

Tyler Adams walks off injured while facing Manchester United; Weston McKennie in action against Roma Robin Jones / Getty Images; Image Photo Agency

With Tyler Adams possibly out until March, thoughts turned to whether other candidates can seriously challenge for his place before the World Cup warm-up games. Elsewhere, the exciting wide options of the United States men's national were underlined.

Welcome to this week's USMNT tracker…

Bournemouth struggled without Adams on Saturday as their winless Premier League streak stretched to eight games in a 1-1 draw with Burnley.

The American midfielder's absence would hurt any team but it remains unclear how long he will be out with a medial knee ligament injury.

His recovery might take another two and a half months, jeopardising his chance of being involved in World Cup warm-up games against Belgium and Portugal on March 28 and March 31.

But even if the 26-year-old gets fit quickly, USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino will be assessing his depth in defensive midfield positions.

Unfortunately, this weekend left Pochettino little fresh evidence to analyse.

He knows all about Aidan Morris' potential, having fielded the 24-year-old in wins over Australia, Paraguay and Uruguay.

Yet a leg injury meant he missed his fifth consecutive game at the weekend and although he is not expected to be out much longer, it has paused his impressive progress in the Championship, English soccer's second tier, since moving to Middlesbrough from Columbus Crew in the summer of 2024.

Pochetinno and his staff will have little to go on when it comes to weekend reports for Tanner Tessmann and Johnny Cardoso, too.

Tessmann had a lively 12 minutes for Lyon after coming off the bench in their comfortable 3-0 Coupe de France win over seventh-tier Saint-Cyr Collonges au Mont d'Or on Sunday.

Tessmann created a good chance that saw Afonso Moreira's shot saved, and had an effort of his own kept out.

But it is Cardoso's status at Atletico Madrid that may cause concern. The 24-year-old has lost his place in Diego Simeone's team, being reduced to just 14 minutes as a substitute across the last seven La Liga games in which he has been fit. Injury has also hampered him, with an ankle problem ruining the opening phase of his season.

Cardoso is a talent and will likely have a place in the USMNT's future, but like everyone else, he will need more domestic minutes in the new year to ensure he makes the cut for the final World Cup squad, especially with Sebastian Berhalter shining when his chances come.

Conversely, the evidence continues to be positive about the national team's attacking potency in wide areas — even if there is less depth than in central midfield.

Antonee Robinson played his second full game for Fulham on Wednesday. Although they lost 2-1 against Newcastle United, the left-back was looking like his old self after finally overcoming a complex knee problem; he created the visitor's goal with a mixture of vision and accurate delivery to tee up Sasa Lukic.

In the right-back berth, Sergino Dest is flying again. Quality assists have arrived in his two most recent Eredivisie games for PSV, and the run and pass to set up USMNT teammate Ricardo Pepi against Utrecht on Sunday was scintillating. That's five league assists this term for the 25-year-old.

And with a goal in each of his past four games, there are plenty of reasons for Pepi to be cheerful, too.

You'd struggle to find too many flaws in Chris Richards' performances for Crystal Palace under Oliver Glasner.

The defender has become a valued part of their prized three-man defence alongside Marc Guehi and Maxence Lacroix.

But Saturday night was a rough one for Palace as they were thrashed 4-1 by Leeds United, inspired by USMNT midfielder Brenden Aaronson. Richards struggled, too.



He should have dealt better with a long throw into the area before Leeds' first goal. The centre-back's attempted clearance from Ethan Ampadu's delivery fell to Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who scored at the second time of asking.

“If you defend the set plays like we did today, you have no chance to get a point in the Premier League,” Palace manager Glasner told the club's website afterwards.

“That's why we lost and conceded all these goals. You have to win your duels.

“It's football, sometimes you can reduce it to the basics, and in the basics we were not good enough.”

It was a mixed evening for Gio Reyna on his return to Borussia Dortmund.

Borussia Monchengladbach lost 2-0 at his former team on Friday, but the USMNT playmaker made a fourth consecutive start.

There was a flash of his mercurial ability early on when he nutmegged close friend Felix Nmecha, and afterward, Reyna told ESPN he is getting sharper.

“I'm just happy to be playing again,” he said. “I love the sport so much, it means so much to me. I had an injury at the beginning of the year and the club has taken care of me and built me up to where I can start games and be fit for pretty much as long as I can.”

As ever, it doesn't matter where Juventus play Weston McKennie: full-back, central midfield, out wide or behind the striker. He has been deployed almost everywhere for the Serie A giants and keeps contributing.

On Saturday, he played on the right flank and created Juve's second goal in a 2-1 win over Roma, moving them to within a point of the fourth-placed visitors.

McKennie's 70th-minute header at goal brought a great initial save from Mile Svilar, but the Roma goalkeeper spilled the ball and Lois Openda buried it.

That's three assists and two goals this term for the USMNT mainstay, with all of those contributions coming in the past four weeks.

Bigger does not always mean better but try telling that to those who govern the world's most popular sport as they reflect on a jam-packed year and begin the countdown to a super-sized World Cup that will dwarf previous tournaments.

World soccer's governing body FIFA — not to mention continental confederations, national leagues and broadcasters — will argue that the appetite for the 'beautiful game'is insatiable and will point to the past 12 months as evidence.

FIFA described its expanded 32-team Club World Cup as a 'roaring success' with 2.4 million fans attending the summer tournament in the United States, including 81,000 for the final in which Chelsea beat Paris Saint-Germain.

The fact Auckland City FC lost 10-0 to Bayern Munich and 6-0 to Benfica while Al Ain suffered 5-0 and 6-0 defeats raised questions about quality control and such mismatches will litter the World Cup.

A record 48 nations — up from 32 in Qatar in 2022 — will descend on the United States, Canada and Mexico for a 104-match tournament that will test the endurance of players, supporters and media to the absolute limit.

Player welfare has already become a flashpoint, with FIFPro warning of rising injury rates and burnout amid an ever-expanding calendar.

Once the likes of Cape Verde, Curacao, Jordan and Uzbekistan have had their moments in the sun, the World Cup will more than likely arrive at its business end with the usual suspects — holder Argentina, France, Brazil, Spain, England and Germany — scrapping for the coveted crown.

Last dance

Television commentators will require copious notes on some unfamiliar names, but two players will need no introduction.

Argentina's Lionel Messi and Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo, the two dominant players of the 21st century, have never faced each other in their five previous World Cups but, if results pan out as expected, could meet for a last dance in a Kansas City quarterfinal, by which time Ronaldo would be 41 and Messi 39.

Neither showed any sign of losing their hunger in 2025 with Ronaldo banging in the goals for Al-Nassr and helping Portugal to the UEFA Nations League title, while Messi won the MLS Cup with Inter Miami plus the MVP award and MLS Golden Boot.

With the pair away from soccer's European heartland, other talents have flourished.

None more so than Ballon d'Or and FIFA Player of the Year winner Ousmane Dembele whose goals propelled PSG to a treble, including their first UEFA Champions League title.

PSG finally delivers

Dembele scored 33 goals in 49 appearances in all competitions and made two assists as PSG finally delivered for its Qatari owners by thrashing Inter Milan 5-0 in the final.

He edged some top-notch competition including Lamine Yamal, who played a key role in Barcelona's 28th Spanish title, and Egypt's Mohamed Salah, whose 47 goal involvements (29 goals and 18 assists) powered Liverpool to the Premier League title in a dream first season for Dutch coach Arne Slot.

England captain Harry Kane was only 13th on the list despite finishing as the Bundesliga's top scorer for the second successive season as Bayern Munich claimed the title.

Barca's Aitana Bonmati secured a third consecutive Ballon d'Or Feminin to underline Spain's depth at the top of the women's game although she suffered heartbreak as her country lost the Euro 2025 final on penalties to England.

That tournament continued the surge of the women's game with record-breaking attendances, while FIFA confirmed plans for an expanded Women's Club World Cup starting in 2027.

UEFA's expanded men's Champions League with its 36-team group phase won over the sceptics with 27 clubs still having something on the line in the eighth and final round of matches.

Exciting as that was, the format played into the hands of the big clubs — none more so than PSG who lost three of its first five games and finished 15th before catching fire in the knockout phase.

Six English clubs qualified for the 2025-26 Champions League -proof if any were needed that the Premier League is indeed in a league of its own. Its 20 clubs spent a combined three billion pounds ($4.01 billion) in the summer transfer window — more than the Bundesliga, La Liga, Ligue 1 and Serie A clubs combined.

Technology also evolved in 2025 with FIFA rolling out accelerated semi-automated offside detection while next year's World Cup will be the most high-tech ever with even the new Trionda ball fitted with an AI chip designed to help match officials get decisions right.

Former Liverpool forward Takumi Minamino is now facing doubts over his involvement for Japan at the World Cup after a crushing injury blow to Wataru Endo‘s teammate.

Minamino has been a key player for Monaco since his £15.5 million move from Liverpool in 2022, as well as a consistent starter for Hajime Moriyasu's Japan.

But he is now expected to miss the remainder of the season and likely the 2026 World Cup after suffering an ACL injury on Sunday.

The 30-year-old was stretchered off 36 minutes into Monaco's 2-1 win over Auxerre in the Coupe de France and his club have now confirmed the extent of the damage.

Minamino is now expected to miss six to nine months of action, which will rule him out of the rest of Monaco's campaign and, if his recovery is at the longer end of the scale, also Japan's involvement at the World Cup.

It will be a major blow to Japan, with Minamino starting nine of their 14 qualifiers and scoring four goals along the way.



He has started five of their last six games – all friendlies – and captained his country in three of those, netting in a famous 3-2 victory over Brazil as well as in a 2-0 win over Ghana in November.

His absence will also be a loss for Endo, who is still Japan captain and, despite losing his place in recent games, will almost certainly play a key role in the USA, Mexico and Canada.



Endo and Minamino have played together on 50 occasions, winning 37 of those, and they are among the most experienced players in Moriyasu's regular squad.

Japan will play the Netherlands, Tunisia and one of Ukraine, Sweden, Poland or Albania in Group F of the World Cup.

It will be their seventh consecutive appearance at the tournament – and their seventh in history – with their best achievement so far being a place in the last 16 on four occasions including in 2022.

The game, rebranded FIFA Super Soccer, claims 9.5 million MAU and 1.5 million sessions per day

FIFA has put its name on established Roblox title Super League Soccer.

In a post on LinkedIn, the football organisation revealed that this game will now be called FIFA Super Soccer, which has been created by developer Gamefam.

The company says that Super League Soccer brought in, on average, 9.5 million monthly active users and 1.5 million game play sessions each day. That's on top of users spending an average of 11 minutes per play session.

The deal follows an initital partnership in the summer, in which FIFA took over Super League Soccer for a limited-time event in June and July during the FIFA Club World Cup 2025. This was judged ""the biggest-ever official football event on Roblox"" with 20 million gameplay sessions and 5.5 million hours of engagement, according to GameFam.

The new partnership ""lets players compete with official national teams and popular clubs, join events aligned with top global leagues, celebrate the road to the FIFA World Cup 2026, and unlock exclusive FIFA and FIFA World Cup gear to outfit their avatars,"" the company said in a press release. It also promises ""select opportunities for FIFA Partners such as Adidas and other brands,"" starting with a four-week Adidas Football Festival featuring 14 football clubs partnered with the company.

“Roblox has shown us how powerfully it can bring fans together and expand football culture,"" FIFA's director of gaming and esports, Christian Volk, said.

""Working with Gamefam allows us to build a genuine football space on the platform.

“This collaboration supports our broader push into gaming, helps us create new and authentic experiences for fans, and opens up more opportunities for partners to engage as we look toward the FIFA World Cup 2026.""

This news comes hot on the heels of FIFA signing an agreement with streaming giant Netflix, which is set to launch on the platform in time for the 2026 World Cup.

“FIFA is very excited to team up with Netflix Games and Delphi Interactive ahead of the FIFA World Cup 2026,"" FIFA president Gianni Infantino said of the deal.

""This major collaboration is a key milestone in FIFA's commitment to innovation in the football gaming space, which aspires to reach billions of football fans of all ages everywhere in the world and will be redefining the pure notion of simulation games. Our reimagined game truly marks the beginning of a new era of digital football. It will be available for free to Netflix members and is a great historic step for FIFA.”

For nearly three decades, FIFA partnered with Electronic Arts for its video game releases. This partnership came to an end in 2022, after reports that the sports giant wanted to double its licensing fee to over $1 billion. Electronic Arts has continued releasing football games under the EA Sports FC banner.

Soccer fans around the world pushed back this month after FIFA unveiled 2026 World Cup prices that would set ticket holders back thousands of dollars. 

Shock turned into outrage as fans accused the organization of betrayal. Tickets for matches that should have cost less than $100 shot up past $4,000, leaving fans and host cities in the United States, Mexico, and Canada fuming. For the final in New Jersey, for example, tickets for mediocre seats will cost more than $6,300 a pop, much higher than even the most expensive seats for the last World Cup in Qatar, which cost about $1,600. 

U.S. fans, eager to have a front-row seat at one of the world's most prestigious sporting events, have complained they are being priced out because they can't afford the high ticket prices. The reality stands in contrast to the message President Donald Trump has been pushing about the health of the U.S. economy and overall affordability. 

In a Dec. 17, 2025, speech that focused heavily on the topic, Trump claimed to be making progress. But he has blamed the problem on his White House predecessor, former president Joe Biden, and illegal immigrants, claiming he “inherited a mess.”

The president has struggled over the past several months to convince the public there isn't an affordability crisis in the country, going so far as to call it a “hoax.” But the inability to purchase soccer tickets for a tournament taking place in the U.S. is yet another example of the economic realities facing the country.

FIFA attempted to hand him a lifeline. In a rare climbdown by the international soccer body, FIFA President Gianni Infantino announced that some $60 tickets would be made available for every game at the tournament, with batches going to the national federations whose teams are playing. It would then be up to those federations to decide how to distribute them. But some say the $60 tickets account for only a tiny sliver of the overall tickets, and that prices and resale values often quadruple, making them unaffordable for the masses. 

The number of $60 tickets for each game is likely to be from 400 to 740 per team, in what FIFA is now calling a “Supporter Entry Tier” price category. FIFA is using 16 host cities, including 11 NFL stadiums in the U.S., plus two in Canada and three in Mexico.

While FIFA has taken a step toward defusing the anger over its ticket prices by lowering the cost of some, it has not resolved the core complaint. 

“Fans are reacting less to the existence of one low price tier and more to the feeling that the average path to attendance is becoming unaffordable,” Irina Tsukerman, a geopolitical analyst and president at Scarab Rising, Inc., told the Washington Examiner. “If the cheapest seats are scarce, restricted to limited matches, or buried behind presales and packages, the headline number reads like a public relations patch rather than a meaningful change. In that sense, FIFA has eased the optics more than it has eased the experience.”

She added that a significant part of the FIFA backlash centers on predictability and trust. 

“Football has long sold itself as the people's game, and the World Cup has been treated as a once-in-a-lifetime event that ordinary fans can still reach with planning and sacrifice,” she said. “When ticket pricing feels opaque, dynamic, or tilted toward corporate buyers, fans start to think they are being priced out by design. FIFA's messaging about affordability clashes with a market reality where many fans worry that the ‘real' tickets are the ones they cannot touch.”

Keith Pagello, founder of TicketData.com, which tracks real-time resale pricing across major ticket marketplaces, told the Washington Examiner that FIFA's $60 ticket offer feels performative. 

“FIFA can point at $60 tickets, but resale data shows that for the vast majority of fans, the realistic cost to attend meaningful World Cup matches will be far higher,” he said. “Based on what we are seeing in the resale market, FIFA has not done enough to ease affordability concerns. While low-priced tickets technically exist, they make up a very small share of inventory and are often limited to a handful of very low-demand matches or early release windows. For nearly all group stage games and knockout rounds, prices are already signaling a much higher barrier to entry than the sport's long-standing affordability narrative suggests.”

Pagello said the backlash is less about “whether cheap tickets exist at all and more about whether fans can realistically access them.” 

“Without greater transparency around low price inventory, expanded price-capped sections, market pricing will continue to define public perception regardless of FIFA's messaging,” he added. 

One defense FIFA has floated for its high ticket prices is that they reflect the North American market. The organization said it tailors all of its tickets to whatever market it is playing in. 

Tsukerman called it an incomplete defense.  

“North American sports pricing is known for premium seating, aggressive fees, and a heavy reliance on hospitality and resale. If FIFA adopts those norms, it imports the same frustrations,” she said. “Fans then perceive that FIFA is borrowing the highest revenue features of the market while still trading on the World Cup's global cultural meaning, which is not supposed to be just another entertainment product.”

Another defense of FIFA's high prices was its not-for-profit designation. The organization said it reinvests 90% of its revenue into global soccer development and needs to capture value from the massive demand, especially with open resale markets. 

“People generally accept that FIFA reinvests revenue into football development, but they still question what portion of revenue depends on squeezing fans,” Tsukerman said. “A nonprofit can still behave in ways that feel extractive, especially when executive pay, event costs, and sponsorship structures appear far removed from the everyday supporter. The issue is not whether FIFA spends money somewhere beneficial. The issue is whether the event's social contract with fans is being preserved.”

Jeff Le, a soccer enthusiast and managing principal at 100 Mile Strategies, told the Washington Examiner that the backlash, not only in ticket prices but also in expensive hotel rates across North America, could do real damage to the World Cup.

“While FIFA has put plans to reduce some select ticket prices to $60, the growing concerns over affordability, inflation, and difficult travel, including visa applications, to the United States could make a significant dent on the success of the competition,” he said. “The tourism industry, in particular, has highlighted major economic impacts should travel restrictions prevent fans of teams from entering the country.”

Le said that Trump's “close embrace of FIFA” also makes World Cup success a political priority.  

“Earlier this year, the President raised public safety concerns in key American host cities, raising the specter of moving the matches to a different location,” he said. “However, with so many different sites to protect and coordination with multiple cities and law enforcement across the other co-hosts – Canada and Mexico – the administration created a FIFA World Cup Task Force to help support the American organization and coordination.”

TRUMP FINALLY GETS HIS PEACE PRIZE AS FIFA HANDS HIM INAUGURAL AWARD AT WORLD CUP DRAW 

Le added that there are still significant concerns around physical and cybersecurity with increased activity from “hactivists and American adversaries, such as Iran, Russia, China, and North Korea.” 

“Cyber concerns could impact both North America's critical infrastructure as well as make World Cup attendees vulnerable to hospitality scams and other cybercrime,” he added. “Elevated prices would be dwarfed by potential disruptions and digital attacks during the tournament and would represent a major setback for the administration heading into the midterm elections.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","‘Do not do what Neymar did!'","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/neymar-vinicius-jr-real-madrid-transfer-warning-ballon-d-or-santiago-bernabeu-message/blt486ed14665916442","Mon, 22 Dec 2025 15:15:28 GMT","

Vinicius Junior has been advised to “not do what Neymar did” when it comes to pushing for a move away from a European superpower. The Brazil international remains tied to Real Madrid for now, but talk of a transfer to the Saudi Pro League being completed refuses to go away. Fellow countryman Sandro believes Vinicius should stay put and compete for future Ballons d'Or.

Neymar is considered to have missed out on several Golden Balls after choosing to leave Lionel Messi and Barcelona for Paris Saint-Germain in 2017. A record-breaking €222 million (£194m/$261m) fee changed hands there, but Neymar never truly sparkled in France.

Vinicius is said to have become a disruptive presence at Santiago Bernabeu, as questions are asked of his commitment to the collective cause, and no extension has been agreed to a contract that is due to expire in 2027.

It may be that the 25-year-old's head has been turned by the riches on offer elsewhere, but Sandro has warned that the grass is not always greener. The former Tottenham midfielder has used Neymar as an example when hammering home that point.

Sandro - speaking to BOYLE SPORTS, who offer the latest football betting - said: “Will Vinicius Junior or Xabi Alonso need to leave Real Madrid? No, I think they can both stay and go on a good run of results together.

“I didn't agree with what Vinicius did, and then Alonso was taking him out, but this is normal. Vinicius just needs to focus on Real Madrid. Do not do what Neymar did at Barcelona and leave. Don't do it, please!

“In Brazil, we say you need to try and stay tranquil. Calm down. Vinicius has this face on him but this can just be a moment. It's nothing. It's not a problem. Being an ex-footballer now, I have to give some advice. You have to breathe before you look to leave.

“I left Tottenham. I thought I wanted to leave because I was fighting the coaches and I rushed things, but man I loved it at Tottenham. Why did I leave? I had a three year contract. Why was I in such a rush? Vinicius please take a breath.

“This is so important in life as well but especially for footballers we have so many people around us telling the player you should leave, the coach doesn't respect you, but come on.""

Sandro added: “Would Vinicius Jr's career suffer if he left Real Madrid now? 100%. The comparison with Neymar leaving Barcelona is beautiful. I still don't understand why Neymar left Barcelona. Why, Neymar? Why? Please tell us why.

“When he left I started to pray. It's easy to say now but I said at the time why are you going to leave Barcelona in your best moment because I love Neymar, and for the first time I saw Lionel Messi giving Neymar the ball in the difficult moments. I was watching Barcelona all the time and everybody passed Messi the ball but in that game against PSG, when Messi is giving you the ball to say, Neymar, you do your magic, wow!

“Imagine you are Neymar. You are on a good run. Now Messi, and he did in a very humble and good way, is saying that he needs you, and you're going to leave? No, I think that was one of the biggest mistakes in all of football. Neymar could have stayed at Barcelona and won three or four Ballon d'Or trophies. So Vinicius, please, calm. Tranquil. Breathe.”

Real Madrid and Vinicius Junior have some big decisions to make in 2026, with prominent figures in the Spanish capital suggesting that the Blancos should open themselves up to offers if the South American forward does not commit to the club and buy into Alonso's way of thinking.

He was jeered by his own supporters when being replaced in a Liga clash with Sevilla, leading to him heading to Dubai during a winter break, and questions will continue to be asked of whether Vini will knuckle down in Spain or chase the money as Neymar once did.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Real Madrid are reportedly set to join Manchester City in the race for Bayern Munich winger Michael Olise, with Europe's elite circling one of the Bundesliga's standout performers. However, Die Roten have made their stance clear as they view the France international as untouchable amid plans to secure his long-term future at the Allianz Arena.

Real Madrid have emerged as the latest heavyweights to show interest in Olise, as per Christian Falk, adding further intrigue to a growing transfer tussle that already includes Manchester City. The Bayern Munich winger has enjoyed a sensational spell in Germany, prompting admiration from across Europe as clubs plan ahead for future transfer windows.

According to the report, Real Madrid's interest is linked to long-term squad planning rather than an immediate move. Los Blancos officials are understood to be assessing options for 2026, with Olise identified as a potential solution should changes be made on the right side of their attack. His profile as a natural winger has caught attention amid the ongoing debate over balance in Madrid's forward line, with Rodrygo, Franco Mastantuono and Brahim Diaz all plying their trade on the right without much progress to show for it.

Despite the growing list of suitors, the report states Bayern  are relaxed about the situation. The Bundesliga champions see Olise as a cornerstone of Vincent Kompany's project and have little intention of entertaining offers, with senior figures stressing that Bayern do not sell players they consider essential to the squad.

Olise's rapid rise since arriving in Munich has placed him firmly among Europe's most coveted wide players. His 30 goals and 37 assists in 80 games so far for the German giants have already positioned him as one of the players in the Bundesliga with the best goal contribution per 90 minutes.

For Real Madrid, the interest reflects a broader strategic outlook. The Spanish giants are already planning beyond the current cycle and could look to reshape their attacking options in the coming years. Speculation around the future of Rodrygo has only intensified discussion about whether a specialist right winger may eventually be required at the Santiago Bernabeu.

Manchester City have been linked with Olise as they consider long-term solutions out wide, especially with tactical flexibility prized in their system. However, both City and Madrid face the same obstacle: Bayern's clear reluctance to negotiate.

Bayern's position has been reinforced by reports that the club are already working on improved contract terms for Olise. The France international is tied down on a long-term deal and the German champions are keen to reward his impact with enhanced wages and potentially an extended agreement, signalling confidence in his importance.

Falk has played down the likelihood of any breakthrough, stressing that Bayern view themselves as a buyer's club rather than a selling one. With Olise and Harry Kane seen as indispensable, the message from Munich is that interest alone will not force a change in stance, regardless of the clubs involved.

He said: “Michael Olise is on the list of multiple European sides. Beyond Real Madrid we can also add Manchester City. Pep Guardiola, as we know, would be very happy to get this deal done. However, Bayern Munich are a buyer's club, not a seller's club. So, if they don't want to sell – they won't sell. And Olise is most certainly one talent they don't want to sell. This season in particular has shown that both Harry Kane and Michael Olise are indispensable to the squad.

“He's already got a long-term contract at the Allianz Arena, and don't forget that Bayern Munich are already working hard on giving him more money with an updated contract (including one year more). So, at the moment, this means no chance for Real Madrid, Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea, and we can add many more to this list.”

In the short term, Olise is expected to remain a central figure at Bayern Munich as they continue to compete domestically and in Europe. Any potential move appears more realistic as a long-term discussion rather than an imminent transfer, particularly with Bayern keen to secure his future.

For Real Madrid and Manchester City, patience may be the only option. Both clubs are known for planning several years ahead and Olise's name is likely to stay on internal shortlists even if Bayern's resolve holds firm through 2026. Ultimately, the winger's future looks settled for now.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Transfer talk over? Harry Kane tipped to remain at Bayern Munich ‘for a long time' after seeing Barcelona move & Premier League return speculated on","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/transfer-talk-over-harry-kane-tipped-bayern-munich-long-time-barcelona-premier-league-return/blta79081fc9cfbd923","Mon, 22 Dec 2025 14:31:27 GMT","

Harry Kane is being tipped to remain at Bayern Munich for “a long time to come”. If that predication proves to be correct, then transfer talk surrounding the England international striker will quieten quickly. He has seen a return to the Premier League mooted, while also being linked with Barcelona, but is fully focused on events in Germany for the foreseeable future.

Kane stepped out of his comfort zone when leaving Tottenham for the Allianz Arena in 2023. He bid farewell to north London as Spurs' all-time leading scorer and has maintained remarkable individual standards at Bayern.

The 30-goal barrier has been reached in the 2025-26 campaign heading into a winter break, with a half-century of efforts at club level being recorded across a calendar year for the first time. A second Bundesliga Golden Boot was collected last season when finding the target on 41 occasions in all competitions.

Kane also lifted his trophy curse when becoming a title winner in Germany. He has savoured a Super Cup success since then and has Champions League glory in his sights for 2026 - alongside a World Cup quest as captain of his country.

The 32-year-old's current contract is due to run until 2027, but it has been revealed that exit clauses in those terms can be triggered in upcoming transfer windows - with an offer of £57 million ($77m) enough to enter into talks.

Kane has offered no indication that he is looking for a new challenge, with it possible that an extension could be agreed in Bavaria. Another legendary Bundesliga goalscorer, Klaus Fischer, believes that the fearsome No.9 will stick around in his current surroundings.

Fischer - who sits behind Gerd Muller and Robert Lewandowski on the all-time chart in the German top-flight - considers Kane to be a “flagship player for the Bundesliga” and a “popular and high-performing player who will hopefully remain in the Bundesliga for a long time to come”.

Bayern are hoping that will prove to be the case. They have seen their talismanic frontman named Person of the Year 2025 by kicker magazine. Kane has told his Cleats Club channel of being “honoured” to receive that accolade.

When offering a congratulatory message to Kane, Bayern's sporting director Max Eberl said of a man that is all about end product: “If I had to describe Harry Kane in three words, I would have answered: goals, goals, goals. Now we have the extraordinary good fortune to experience him daily at FC Bayern – three words aren't enough, but if I had to narrow it down: down-to-earth, world-class, game-changer – and all of that applies at every level.”

Kane has hit 19 Bundesliga goals this season, leaving him on course to chase down Lewandowski's record tally of 41 from 2020-21. Bayern legend Mario Basler has told Absolut Fussball of that challenge: “I think Harry Kane is a different kind of player. Lewandowski wasn't the type of player who worked so hard defensively. Harry Kane does that.

“Kane is sometimes deployed as a backup to Nicolas Jackson when he comes on as a substitute, and he also frequently operates in midfield, winning the ball and distributing it. I believe he has a chance to break the goalscoring record this season. For me, he is an exceptional striker and the player of the year.”

Kane has told Sky Sport Germany of his bid to earn another entry in the history books: “I think it's possible, especially with the start I've had so far this year. There's still a long way to go. I need to be able to maintain this level for another four or five months. In football, the hardest thing is to be consistent over a long period. This record is an incredible record and it will be hard to beat, I know that. I always enjoy trying to have these ambitions.”

Bayern and Kane are now taking a well-earned break, with Vincent Kompany's side not due to return to action until January 11. They boast a nine-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga table, having gone unbeaten through 15 fixtures, and are on course to wrap up a top-eight finish and automatic qualification for the last-16 of the Champions League.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

GOAL runs the rule over the British players earning a living away from their homeland, with plenty more stars deciding to leave their comfort zones in search of a better footballing life elsewhere. The Premier League is still obviously one of the world's most entertaining divisions and the Championship can prove fantastic for development, but there are more options out there.

Most of Europe played their final matches before their winter breaks this weekend, with the rest of the continent not quite as receptive to the idea of festive football as they are in the United Kingdom. There were stellar performances from two of England's best players, while there is a cup final between two Scotsmen to be played on a different continent altogether.

Every Monday this season, GOAL brings you the latest on British stars abroad, what they're getting up to, who is reaching the greatest heights and who needs to come home. Let's get stuck into this week's review.

It feels like Harry Kane shatters a new record every weekend, but there was some significance to his antics on Sunday. The striker scored the final goal of Bayern Munich's 4-0 win away at Heidenheim, neatly bringing the ball under control before swivelling and firing in at the goalkeeper's near post.

That's par for the course for golf-fanatic Kane, but this was his 100th contribution in the Bundesliga - a split of 81 goals and 19 assists - in 78 games, becoming the quickest player to reach that milestone in the competition's history, while he ends 2025 with 60 goals in all competitions.

This performance also came off the back of being named kicker's German Footballing Personality of the Year for the first time. Kane was also handed the captain's armband for the first time at Bayern, with regular skippers Manuel Neuer and Joshua Kimmich both sitting this match out. Bayern are halfway to an unbeaten domestic season and lead the Bundesliga by nine points from second-placed Borussia Dortmund.

""Ending the year on a high! Great performance today to round off a brilliant start to the season. On a personal note delighted to lead the boys out as captain and reach 100 goal contributions in the Bundesliga. Time to to recover over the winter break and go again in 2026,"" Kane wrote on Instagram post-match.

Regarding the win to ensure Bayern ended 2025 unbeaten on the road in the Bundesliga, Kane told the press: ""We put in a good performance in the first half, scoring two goals and dominating the game. In the second half, we missed a lot of chances, and Heidenheim also had some good opportunities, where Jonas [Urbig] made a few good saves. We could have decided the game earlier - but in the end, it's an important win.""

""I won my first team trophy in the summer, which was very special,"" he added, reflecting on 2025. ""We also gained a lot of energy as a team at the Club World Cup, and that's hard to break. We're in a good position in every competition, so we'll see how far we can go, we'll try to continue as well as possible.""

Real Madrid were made to work by Sevilla for their 2-0 win in La Liga on Saturday, with an anxious Bernabeu crowd at least seeing their side take the three points as an early Christmas present. Los Blancos opened the scoring shortly before the half-time break when Rodrygo's whipped free-kick picked out Jude Bellingham, who rose highest to guide a header into the far corner and ease some of the tensions inside the stadium.

It was quite the slog to victory from there, however, with supporters getting on the back of several players, including Vinicius Jr, before Kylian Mbappe's 86th-minute penalty put daylight between the two sides. Marcao was sent off for Sevilla midway through the second half, while head coach Matias Almeyda was sent to the stands during the break on a heated evening in the Spanish capital.

Despite being the one to break the deadlock, Bellingham was merely an afterthought in the local press, with most of the focus surrounding Mbappe's Cristiano Ronaldo-like impact and tribute, as well as the potential exit of Vinicius amid a standoff in contract talks.

""Nice way to end 2025 but we have to be better in 2026,"" Bellingham said in an Instagram post after ending a run of seven games without a goal. ""Madridistas, through the good and bad thank you for all your support this year!""

Conor Gallagher has been in and out of the Atletico Madrid starting line up all season long, though it appears his most useful role is coming off the bench having now scored all three of his goals this term as a substitute. The midfielder's latest strike came in Atleti's 3-0 win at Girona to extend an impressive run to 11 wins in 13 games since they were thrashed in the Champions League by Arsenal in October.

MARCA described Gallagher, who replaced the injured Nico Gonzalez on the 28-minute mark, as 'omnipresent' in Atletico's attacks, crediting his forward-thinking performance despite the perception that Diego Simeone's substitution was a negative one. Though he found the net with a deflected strike from the edge of the box towards the end of the first half, Gallagher was hauled back off late in the second after ""misplacing one of those balls that drive the man in the black suit crazy.""

Nevertheless, this was still an impressive cameo for a man who is trying to do all he can to work his way back into Thomas Tuchel's thinking ahead of England's World Cup campaign. Links to Manchester United are refusing to subside, and a return to his home country could be on the cards this January.

Though Atletico and Real won this weekend, both Madrid clubs still trail La Liga leaders Barcelona by nine and four points, respectively, after the reigning champions beat Villarreal on Sunday.

There'll be a particularly British flavour to Monday's Suppercoppa Italiana final between Napoli and Bologna, with Scott McTominay's Serie A champions facing the Coppa Italia winners, who boast the presence of Lewis Ferguson and Jonathan Rowe.

Antonio Conte's kings of Italy advanced to the showpiece event in Riyadh after beating AC Milan 2-0 on Thursday, but the Rossoblu's semi-final was not quite as straightforward. They came from a goal down to draw 1-1 with Inter, sending the tie to a penalty shootout. Five spot kicks were missed in total between the two sides, but Ferguson and Rowe both scored from 12 yards to send Bologna through.

Ferguson, Bologna's captain, has struggled for consistent game time this season, though head coach Vincenzo Italiano has insisted this has been due to fitness issues rather than for any overriding tactical reasons, and is hopeful the midfielder can lead the club to another trophy after playing a major role in helping Scotland qualify for the World Cup.

""It's not a matter of minutes or fitness. He's alternating matches of great focus and quality with others that are less sharp. It can happen,"" Italiano said last week. ""There are no issues. When he goes away with the national team, he performs at a very high level; here, it's a bit of an up-and-down period. He's also coming off some minor knee issues.""

Compatriot McTominay, meanwhile, will be hoping to get his hands on more silverware at his international team-mate's expense, who has been hailed as the strongest player in Italy ahead of the final. Sam Beukema, who joined Napoli from Bologna over the summer, told Serie A's YouTube channel: ""I have to say my friend Scott. He's incredibly strong, and he's also a great human being.""

Marseille sailed into the last 32 of the Coupe de France with an emphatic 6-0 win away at third-tier side Bourg-Peronnas. Roberto De Zerbi's men went into the half-time interval only one goal to the good before taking the handbrake off in the second 45, with Mason Greenwood scoring their second of the afternoon. Fellow Manchester United academy graduate Angel Gomes, who has already been linked with an exit despite only joining the club in the summer, grabbed an assist as a timely reminder of his quality.

Despite the final scoreline showing a clear difference in class, De Zerbi was slightly critical of his players for their defending. ""It wasn't perfect. We conceded too many scoring opportunities,"" he said during his post-match press conference. ""But we played well, a serious match, approached with the right mindset. We know that in the Coupe de France there can be surprises. We won 6-0, but it was only 1-0 at half-time.""

Ahead of Marseille's winter break, Italian boss added: ""There's a bit of fatigue. We've had four intense months, and in Marseille, four months would be like four years elsewhere. We're already ready for January, which will be an important month for us. There's the start of Ligue 1, the Champions Trophy in Kuwait, and a round of the Coupe de France. The beginning of the year will be crucial.

""I really like my players, I congratulated them, I told them we've had a good, positive start to the season, with some important results. I told them to come back on December 28 for the resumption of training fully motivated because that will be necessary for January.""

At the age of 28, Ainsley Maitland-Niles is one of the elder statesmen for Lyon, whose nickname of 'Les Gones' translates to 'The Kids'. On Sunday, he captained a senior team for the first time in his career, donning the armband as OL beat semi-professional outfit Saint-Cyr Collonges 3-0 in their own Coupe de France tie.

Though the gulf in quality ought to have told from the off, Saint-Cyr Collonges managed to get to half-time at the Groupama Stadium on level terms. Mehdi Chakri got the hosts off the mark on the other side of the break, while two goals from Pavel Sulc in the final five minutes rounded off proceedings as the visitors left with their heads held high.

Maitland-Niles was restored to the starting XI and given the captaincy after returning from suspension for a red card picked up in a loss to Lorient a fortnight ago. Despite this, he remains a favourite among Lyon fans and has been welcomed back into the fold with open arms.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Real Madrid have been advised to do ""everything possible” to sell Vinicius Junior if he demands a contract similar to Kylian Mbappe and Lionel Messi. The Brazilian forward is not considered to be deserving of such terms, with the Blancos needing to move him on - amid interest from the Saudi Pro League - as no player is bigger than the Liga heavyweights.

Vinicius, who narrowly missed out on the Ballon d'Or in 2024, is working on a deal at Santiago Bernabeu that is due to run until 2027. No extension has been agreed as yet, which means offers will have to be listened to in upcoming transfer windows.

The 25-year-old forward has been heavily linked with a move to the Middle East, with it being suggested that he could follow Real legends Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema to that part of the world.

Lucrative terms would be on offer there, with Real being warned off trying to match said proposals. They are being urged to cash in on the South American while his price tag remains high, with there little value to be found in paying him the kind of figures that current ‘Galactico' Mbappe and Argentine GOAT Messi pull in.

Former Real striker and director Predrag Mijatovic has spoken out against Vinicius on a regular basis of late. He has now told Carrusel Deportivo of future talks in the Spanish capital: “If he is now asking for the same contract as Mbappe or Messi, it is clear that he does not want to renew; that is obvious. We are not children, please. And if he wants to finish his contract at Real Madrid, that's fine.

“The club has to be above any player, whoever they may be, and all players have to accept one thing that Madrid will continue to win with Vinicius, without Vinicius, because Real Madrid always wins.”

Mijatovic added, with Vinicius not considered to be integral to long-term planning at the Bernabeu: “Real Madrid always has to be above any player, any figure in football, because it is the biggest club in the world.

“If Vinicius refuses to renew his contract, Real Madrid has to do everything possible to transfer him. Under no circumstances can you allow a player or his representatives to control you.”

Interested parties may begin to sound Vinicius out in the new year if it becomes apparent that no terms will be thrashed out in Madrid. Big-spending teams in Saudi Arabia are expected to lead that chase.

Omar Mugharbel, CEO of the Saudi Pro League, has previously told Marca of long-standing interest being held in Vinicius: “We don't have dreams, it's a matter of time and negotiation.”

He added on more top talent being lured to an ambitious sporting project, with several big names having already trodden that path: “Foreign players have always been part of Saudi teams. In recent years, the number of possible foreign players in teams has changed. This season we have included the number of eight plus two others under 21 years of age.

“It has always been in the DNA of this league to bring in players from outside to make it more attractive. What has changed massively, especially in the last two years, has been the quality of the players who come. Benzema, among others, create a bigger impact, both nationally and internationally.”

Vinicius is in the Middle East at present, having jetted off to Dubai after seeing Real reach their winter break. He left Spain immediately after being taunted by his own supporters in a 2-0 victory over Sevilla - he was replaced in that contest late on.

The Brazilian has registered just five goals and eight assists through 24 appearances in all competitions this season. With supporters jeering him on home soil, exit speculation has been ramped up. He is no longer considered to be indispensable, with Mbappe now very much the leading man in Madrid while the likes of Jude Bellingham and Rodrygo fill support roles.

Are Ryan Reynolds & Rob Mac locked in ‘golden handcuffs' after stake sale & questions of what would happen without Hollywood co-owners?","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/welcome-to-wrexham-ryan-reynolds-rob-mac-golden-handcuffs-stake-sale-without-hollywood-co-owners/bltbfe4b10e7d7cde73","Mon, 22 Dec 2025 12:01:30 GMT","

Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac have sold another stake in Wrexham, but the Red Dragons - and their new investors - are expected to have Hollywood co-owners locked in “golden handcuffs”. Their value to the collective cause is not lost on anybody connected with the Welsh club, with a meteoric rise to prominence being enjoyed under A-list chairmen.

Reynolds and Mac completed their stunning takeover at the Racecourse Ground in 2021. They have guided the Red Dragons from the National League to the Championship, with a historic run of three successive promotions being enjoyed.

A window to the world has been opened up in the ‘Welcome to Wrexham' documentary series, with fans being found in every corner of the planet. Commercial revenue has soared as a brand is built to rival Premier League, European and MLS heavyweights.

Reynolds and Mac no longer boast complete control at Wrexham. They have previously entered into a partnership with the wealthy Allyn family, while Apollo Sports Capital now own a 10 per cent share of the second tier outfit.

Famous faces retain majority control in North Wales, with Reynolds and Mac integral to Wrexham's past, present and future. If they were to move on, then serious questions would be asked of how interest can be retained while pushing towards the top flight of English football.

With that in mind, it is being suggested that investors will have sought guarantees that Reynolds and Mac are going nowhere. Football finance expert Kieran Maguire has told the Price of Football podcast: “The value in Wrexham comes from the connection to Reynolds and Mac and the documentary. The reason why Wrexham sell 100,000 shirts a year is that a huge proportion of those are to people who are fans of the Welcome to Wrexham documentary.

“If you take away Reynolds and Mac, will those people continue to have the same degree of enthusiasm for Wrexham? I think not. Part of the value of the brand of Wrexham is linked to the owners, but the owners are smart enough to realise that as well.

“I would imagine that Apollo and the other American investors probably have some form of golden handcuffs agreement with Reynolds and Mac, which says that you've got to commit to your involvement with the club for at least the next five years, because we might want to extract value going forwards.""

He added, with it already being announced that ‘Welcome to Wrexham' will be back for Season 5 in 2026: “If they get promoted to the Premier League, you've got another series of the programme and that part of the fairy tale is able to continue.”

Reynolds has previously stated that he and Mac have no intention of severing their emotional and financial ties with Wrexham. The Deadpool actor told the Hollywood Reporter after selling a minority stake to the Allyns: “No, we will remain majority owners. The team is growing faster than anyone expected. There are needs that require a certain type of skill and people who have some experience in growing things.

“We chose the Allyn family because they have similar values that make Wrexham. They've been revitalising towns and communities for many years in upstate New York, and that's why bringing them on didn't cause a big stir.”

Reynolds and Mac said in a joint statement when announcing the deal struck with Apollo - who are already associated with La Liga giants Atletico Madrid: “From day one, we wanted to build a sustainable future for Wrexham Association Football Club and to do it with a little heart and humour. The dream has always been to take this club to the Premier League while staying true to the town.

""Growth like that takes world-class partners who share our vision and ambition, and Apollo absolutely does. We have known Al Tylis, the CEO of Apollo Sports Capital, for many years and are thrilled to now have ASC join the Wrexham family as we take the next step forward together.”

Steven Gerrard has delivered a clear verdict on Arne Slot's future amid mounting pressure at Liverpool, insisting he wants the Dutch manager to turn things around rather than be replaced at Anfield. However, the Reds legend also made it clear he would return to Anfield in any capacity if asked by the hierarchy, underlining his enduring loyalty to the club.

Gerrard has spoken candidly about the situation at Liverpool, addressing speculation surrounding the future of Slot and his own long-term connection to the club. With Liverpool enduring an inconsistent title defence, pressure has begun to build on Slot, prompting discussion about potential changes behind the scenes.

Gerrard, who remains one of the most influential figures in Liverpool's modern history, has been undertaking regular punditry work since stepping away from management earlier this year. During a recent interview, he was asked directly whether he harboured ambitions of returning to Anfield in a working role, particularly if Slot's position were to come under serious threat.

Rather than fuelling speculation, Gerrard made his position clear by separating his personal loyalty to Liverpool from respect for the current manager. While reiterating his willingness to help the club in any way possible, he stressed that he does not want to see Slot lose his job and would prefer stability as Liverpool attempt to regain consistency.

When questioned about the possibility of returning to the club in a professional capacity, Gerrard told TNT Sports' Ally's Social Club: “I'll be brutally, brutally honest with you. I'd help Liverpool in any department at any minute of every day. I'd help them with anything."" His comments reflected both his emotional connection to Liverpool and his openness to contributing away from the pitch if required.

However, Gerrard was equally firm in his backing of Slot. “I don't want Arne Slot to lose his job,” he explained. “I want him to fix this and turn it around and make Liverpool great. I was bouncing all over the city four or five months ago when Liverpool won the league.”

The former captain concluded by reinforcing where his priorities lie. “I'm a Liverpool fan. I want the best for Liverpool. But if Liverpool need me in any department at any time, I'll be there for them.”

Gerrard's comments come at a delicate moment in Liverpool's season. After winning the Premier League title in 2024-25, expectations were high, but the Reds have struggled to replicate that form consistently. A run of mixed results earlier in the campaign saw them drift away from the summit and sparked debate over whether Slot's methods were translating effectively in his second season.

Recent performances have offered some encouragement as a 2-1 victory away at Tottenham marked Liverpool's third win in five matches and lifted them into fifth place, keeping them in the hunt for Champions League qualification. While the title race appears beyond reach, the improvement has eased some of the immediate pressure on Slot.

Gerrard's perspective carries particular weight given his own managerial journey. Once viewed as a natural successor to the Liverpool job, he experienced contrasting spells at Rangers, Aston Villa and Al-Ettifaq. Those experiences have shaped a more measured outlook, with Gerrard openly acknowledging the challenges of elite management and the importance of stability within a club.

For now, Slot remains focused on steering Liverpool back toward the top four and restoring belief after a turbulent period. Gerrard's public backing may help cool speculation, reinforcing the idea that change is not inevitable and that patience could yet be rewarded if results continue to improve.

Gerrard, meanwhile, remains without a managerial role and continues his punditry work while assessing future opportunities. Despite links to former clubs elsewhere, his comments suggest that any return to Liverpool would only come if it aligned with the club's needs rather than personal ambition.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Alcaraz's ultimate nullifier: Inside the Spaniard's first-serve return success","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/alcaraz-infosys-atp-beyond-the-numbers-december-2025","Mon, 22 Dec 2025 14:44:44 GMT","

Carlos Alcaraz possesses the ultimate nullifier in his arsenal.

The ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF is a dynamic all-around player who puts on a show with his shotmaking. But his secret weapon is his first-serve return.

According to an Infosys ATP Beyond The Numbers analysis, Alcaraz has led the Tour in first-serve return points won in three consecutive seasons. In 2025, the Spaniard won 35 per cent of those points, with only Jannik Sinner (33.6%) and Francisco Cerundolo (33.4%) winning more than 33 per cent.

First-Serve Return Points Won (2025)

The first serve is a key weapon on the ATP Tour, with many players putting foes on the back foot immediately and earning plenty of free points. Even the Spaniard wins just more than one out of every three first-serve return points. That is why his edge over his rivals in the category is even more important. 

The 22-year-old's 35 per cent win rate against first serves in 2025 was at least 10 per cent better than seven of the other nine players who finished in the year-end Top 10.  

2025 Year-End Top 10: First-Serve Return Points Won




Alcaraz's first-serve return winning percentage was 33.9 per cent better than World No. 9 Ben Shelton's (26.2%) and 33.2 per cent better than World No. 6 Taylor Fritz's (26.3%). 

This was not a one-year success story, either. Alcaraz has dominated the category for years. Dating back to his first season on the ATP Tour in 2021, the 24-time tour-level titlist has never finished outside of the top five on Tour.

Over the past three years, nobody has been close to Alcaraz. His 35 per cent win rate against first serves since 2023 is more than six per cent better than Alex de Minaur, who ranks second on Tour during the same period (32.9%). Daniil Medvedev (32.9%) is right behind De Minaur.

First-Serve Return Points Won (2023-2025)

Alcaraz tallied a 71-9 record in 2025 according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. But there was a trend in his losses: below-average first-serve return performance.

The Tour leader in titles (8) and match wins (71) lost just nine times, and in seven of those defeats he won 31 per cent of his first-serve return points or less. In five of those matches, he claimed at most 27 per cent of his first-serve return points.

The only outliers were in the Australian Open quarter-finals against Novak Djokovic and the BNP Paribas Open semi-finals against Jack Draper. Alcaraz won 36 per cent of points against his opponents' first serve in those clashes.

On the whole, Alcaraz does a better job than anyone else of neutralising his opponents' first-serve effectiveness. That was one of the reasons why he was able to finish year-end No. 1 for the second time and will be something the Spaniard will rely on moving into 2026 and beyond.

The Sauber name is disappearing from the Formula 1 grid next season when the team will become the Audi works outfit. To mark this longstanding name bowing out of the sport, we asked F1 Hall of Fame journalist David Tremayne for his best memories of the Swiss team's three decades of Grand Prix racing…

I've been lucky enough to work for several F1 teams over the years, writing their daily press releases at races. Of them all, Peter Sauber's became my favourite. Which is funny, because when I told friends in the paddock of my new job, several of them turned their noses up. Sauber was Swiss-German and therefore, apparently, “boring”.

Most of them hadn't bothered going there for information when they arrived in 1993, with the pretty C12 powered by Mercedes' V10 engine, designed by Harvey Postlethwaite and driven by JJ Lehto and Karl Wendlinger.

F1 Animated! The funny side of the 2025 season

Best of Iconic Onboards 2025

Max Verstappen has revealed that various factors would come into play if he were to ever consider making a move away from Red Bull in the future.

Max Verstappen has given an insight into the talks that were held earlier in the year over a potential Mercedes switch, with the Dutchman also reflecting on the factors that would matter to him if he were to consider a move away from Red Bull in the future.

Despite holding a contract to race for the Milton Keynes-based outfit through to the end of 2028, speculation linking Verstappen to a possible Mercedes move started to mount during the middle of the 2025 season.

This was brought to a close ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix in August when Verstappen confirmed that he would be driving for Red Bull in 2026, adding: “I think it's time to basically stop all the rumours, and for me it's always been quite clear that I was staying anyway.”

Several months on, the four-time World Champion was quizzed during an interview with BBC Sport on how seriously he considered a possible move, leading him to explain how various elements would play a part in any decision about his future.

""For me, it's not only about F1,"" said Verstappen, who has been a part of Red Bull's line-up since his promotion from Toro Rosso in 2016. ""There's a lot of things that have to come together for me to make a change. Future roles, stuff like that.

“So if I ever would make a change, of course, it's a big one for me because this definitely feels like a second family, and that's not easy to replicate, let's say, like that.

""The change, if I would ever make one, it's not only because I need a faster F1 car or I need a difference in the environment. There's a lot of things that are around my F1 career and things that I'm doing outside of F1 that all have to come together.""

Pushed further on whether this means that it was not something he was seriously considering at the time, Verstappen responded: “I'm not going to lie. For sure, there were talks. But at the same time, it was all very friendly and open. Nothing more than that.""

Verstappen – who won on his GT3 debut at the Nurburgring Nordschleife in September – also spoke of his desire to continue improving as a driver, adding that he does this by “always trying to look for details, trying to just learn about the car, learn about yourself, do a lot of things also outside of F1.”

""I'm driving, of course, a lot of different cars, external which I don't think it hurts you, racing in F1,” the 28-year-old continued. “So, yeah, just trying to make yourself a bit more of a complete driver, a bit more all-round.""

The Canadian series with explicit male-on-male sex scenes has tapped into a long-overlooked corner of the audience — and caught Hollywood by surprise


							By 

	Seth Abramovitch


Senior Writer


	Thursday nights at the Poliquin household in Vancouver, British Columbia, are set aside for appointment viewing. That's when new episodes of Heated Rivalry — the steamy gay hockey drama that has everyone buzzing — drop on premium streamer Crave in Canada and HBO Max in the U.S.


	Not everyone joins in on the fun. The family's two children, 11 and 13, are dispatched to their rooms. Matt, the dad, wanders off to the kitchen. It's just Joy, a 45-year-old mom, who's planted on the couch, eagerly awaiting every horny hookup between the show's hunky protagonists: Russian Ilya Rozanov (played by Texas-born Connor Storrie, 25), star center of the fictional Boston Raiders, and Shane Hollander (Canadian actor Hudson Williams, 24), team captain of the also-fictional Montreal Metros.

	“It was getting a lot of promo, so I was like, ‘I'll check it out. I don't think this is going to be my thing,' ” says Joy, recounting how she discovered and fell in love with the show, scripted and directed by Jacob Tierney (writer-director of the cult Canadian comedy Letterkenny) and based on the popular book series by fellow Canadian Rachel Reid. “Obviously, the stars are beautiful. But the pleasure is presented in a different way. It's very reciprocal. There's lots of consent. They're always checking in with each other, which is incredibly attractive to watch.” 

	











	Joy is hardly the show's only female fan — indeed, legions of women across the globe are tuning in, from Australia and New Zealand to Spain, with streamers in the U.K. and Ireland soon to follow. Against all odds, in a twist virtually nobody saw coming, a modestly budgeted Canadian drama featuring raunchy, borderline-graphic male-on-male sex has become one of streaming's biggest recent hits thanks in a very significant way to females — straight, bi or otherwise.


	“You'd never think it,” Tierney says. “But the baked-in audience for this is women. It's wine moms. They love this stuff. And the thing that is so interesting is that the people that don't know about it are gay men. The women have been waiting for this — and the gay men don't see it coming.”


	***


	As it turns out, there's a long-hidden history of women quietly consuming male-to-male romance and erotica. It goes all the way back to the 1970s, and half a world away, to when female manga artists in Japan began experimenting with stories centered on romantic relationships between men. By the 1980s, the genre exploded beyond Asia to become a DIY phenomenon globally, with fans pairing off popular anime and other pop culture characters into fantasy relationships — what's known as “slashfic” (here in the West, Star Trek's Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock were a popular early pairing).


	 “Women would circulate photocopied zines of their slashfic at general fan conventions,” explains sex researcher Lucy Neville, author of Girls Who Like Boys Who Like Boys: Women and Gay Male Pornography and Erotica. “They'd sniff out the other perverts.”

	











	When the internet arrived, those stories exploded in scale. Communities formed on platforms like LiveJournal, Tumblr and Archive of Our Own, creating a vast, mostly female-driven literary universe that eventually found a foothold in mass-market publishing, with books like Special Forces and Captive Prince centered around gay male couples but aimed at female readerships.


	“The males in these books are reconfigured,” says Guy Mark Foster, a professor of 20th century American literature at Maine's Bowdoin College who has studied the genre. “They're not toxic men. They are not dating multiple people at one time. They are interested in their partner's pleasure — not simply their own pleasure.”


	Eventually, inevitably, Hollywood took notice. Its first major foray into the oeuvre was Netflix's 2022 adaptation of Alice Oseman's popular 2016 webcomic Heartstopper, about two British schoolboys who fall in love. Then, a year later, Amazon dropped Red, White and Royal Blue, a feature film about an affair between a president's son and a British royal. Both projects performed well enough to prove the genre could not only find a mainstream audience but also mint stars (Royal Blue's Nicholas Galitzine will be starring next year as He-Man).


	Still, both were relatively mild portrayals of gay romance — more PG than hard R.


	Enter Heated Rivalry, the most balls-to-the-wall erotic programming to hit screens since Skinemax. While not hardcore porn, the show does go well beyond suggestion, with plenty of full nudity, extended sex scenes, depictions of oral and penetrative intercourse as well as mutual masturbation — all presented with top-rate production values, idealized perfect male bodies and storylines that leave plenty of room for romance and even affectionate dialogue.

	











	Who knew? It turned out to be exactly what female viewers have been longing for all along.


	***


	“It was my first stab at any kind of writing,” says author Reid. “I just did it out of boredom. I needed a creative outlet when I was raising young kids.”


	A native of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Reid has been a hockey fan for most of her life. But some aspects of the sport's culture made her feel “sad and angry,” she says. “One of the big ones is homophobia. I kept thinking about how difficult it would be to be a closeted NHL player. I wanted to write a book where a player did come out and found happiness and love.”


	The result was 2018's Game Changer, the first book in what would quickly become a series. The debut novel features neither Ilya nor Shane — its characters are Scott, a pro hockey player, and Kip, a barista and grad student (they're introduced in the show's third episode). More books followed, including 2020's Common Goal, a May-December matchup between a retired goalie and a college student that Tierney affectionately refers to as “Call Me By Your Twink.”


	The books were best-sellers for Harlequin well before Tierney turned Heated Rivalry, Reid's 2019 installment, into a TV show, having sold 650,000 copies. Now they're sold out on Amazon and occupy the top slot on the Kindle charts.


	Tierney is the last person you'd expect to be a voracious consumer of romance novels. A scraggly 46-year-old former child actor (he lived in L.A. as a kid and shared an agent with Ryan Phillippe, occasionally booking roles on shows like Touched by an Angel), the Montrealer in the horn-rimmed glasses and the five-o'clock shadow looks like a tortured screenwriter, not a wine mom.

	











Heated Rivalry was not shoved into Tierney's hands by a pushy producer. He was turned onto Reid's books during the pandemic and fell in love with them on his own. “A friend said, ‘Why don't you listen to some audiobooks?' and Heated Rivalry was one of the first I listened to,” he says. “I was like, ‘Boy, these books are spicy.' But it's also funny, it's smart — and a very compelling love story.”


	Tierney was working in reality TV as executive producer of The Traitors Canada when he read a Washington Post article about romance novels being a billion-dollar industry that doesn't get taken particularly seriously. “Then it noted that hockey romances are especially popular,” he recalls. “I literally gasped.” In the article's second paragraph, there was a mention of Heated Rivalry. Panicked that another producer might beat him to it, he reached out to Reid on Instagram. Luckily for him, Reid turned out to be a Letterkenny fan. They bonded over a mutual love of hockey and Canadian pride. She agreed to sell him the rights to her books.


	“Then I kind of soft-pitched it,” he continues. “I was like, ‘We got these books. It's this gay hockey smut.' And everybody went, ‘Really? Tell me about that.' The level of lean-in to my elevator pitch was huge — which I wasn't expecting.”


	In writing the pilot, Tierney took great care to “script the fuck out of these sex scenes.” He was also methodical about finding the right actors to play Ilya and Shane. “It couldn't be a thing where every day they're like, ‘Do we have to do this?' I needed a certain amount of buy-in,” he says, “and I got very lucky with the actors that I cast.”

	











	***


	Reid has theories as to why women are so drawn to her material. “A lot of my female readers prefer to not have a woman in the book because of their own, usually dark pasts with sex with men,” she says. “They prefer to get lost in a fantasy where there's nobody there that they can relate to directly. They don't want to insert themselves into these sex scenes. It just feels safer.”


	She also thinks there's an appeal to the kinds of men she writes about — men “who are emotionally vulnerable, who are maybe just a little bit different from the partner they have or the ex that they had.”


	Then there's just the basic math of human sexuality. If you like penises, the thinking goes, two are better than one. “Men like lesbian porn,” Reid reasons. “So why wouldn't women like this?”


	For sex researcher Neville, those numbers add up. She points to Pornhub, which is “quite generous with its data” regarding who is viewing its content. “For a decade now, male-male porn is the second most common choice among female viewers. The last time I checked, approximately 46 percent of people watching man-on-man scenes were women,” she says.


	Neville has conducted research studies of women who exclusively consume male-male romances. “Quite often, they are the victims of sexual violence, rape, sexual assault — often when they were quite young — and they felt really alienated from the entire concept of heterosexual sex,” she says. “They just find it really triggering. Men together was something they could just watch and enjoy sexually, romantically, without having to really engage with some of the more complex stuff going on with their feelings about their own sexuality.”

	











	Foster has published papers on the phenomenon and has found no tidy explanation. The professor agrees that some women feel liberated by the omission of objectified female bodies. They can also be stimulated by the absence of male toxicity. But there are other, more nuanced factors at play.


	“Sigmund Freud has famously said that everyone is born with a predisposition toward bisexuality,” he says. “A lot of women writers of slash romances have admitted to having been tomboys in their earlier life. When women are mandated to give up being a tomboy as they mature, these books allow women a means to explore a suppressed male identity.”


	Joy, the Heated Rivalry superfan with a husband and kids in Vancouver — who, by the way, identifies as queer — thinks the genre helps bridge a gender divide. “It shows men who have shut down parts of themselves to survive beginning to live authentically,” she says. “This is often true of women in the roles we are expected to play every day — there are unspoken expectations that are hard to escape, including how we show up as sexual animals and what we can desire.”


	As for Tierney, he doesn't have much time these days for theories — he's barely had a moment to pop his head out of the editing bay to enjoy the show's success. At interview time, he was still cutting episodes five and six, and soon he'll need to start planning for an already-ordered second season. “That will largely be based around The Long Game, which is what Shane and Ilya's other book is called,” he says. “I'm going to put some other stuff as well from the other books to keep the fans happy, which is my pleasure.”

	











	Fans are happy, all right. Even the NHL, which in recent years has been trying to broaden its appeal to gay sports fans with LGBTQ-themed events and nights, has expressed delight with the program.


	“There are so many ways to get hooked on hockey and, in the NHL's 108-year history, this might be the most unique driver for creating new fans,” a league rep tells THR. “See you all at the rink.”


	Ironically, about the only ones who haven't been totally on board with HBO's hit show about gay hockey players are … gay men. To be sure, gay men have embraced the show in large and enthused numbers. (WeHo bars have been playing host to packed and boisterous viewing parties.) But a faction of them object to what they see as a co-opting and neutering of gay sexual desire for female audiences. Jordan Firstman, who stars on HBO's I Love LA, kicked off a firestorm of controversy when he declared in a Vulture interview that the sex in the show “is not how gay people fuck” and that the series caters to people who “want to see two straight hockey players pretending to be gay.”


	Firstman ended up walking back his comments on Instagram (“I love Heated Rivalry and ultimately I'm a faggot who can't shut the fuck up,” he posted). Later, in a show of network harmony, he appeared all smiles alongside Hudson Williams at an HBO Max promotional event in Century City.


	But Firstman hasn't been the only one complaining. A withering review in The Guardian says the show “is content to exploit gay culture without understanding it in a meaningful way. … There is a weird kind of fetish in these works that de-sexes gay men just enough to make them palatable, like pets for young women.” Another line of attack likens the show to when bachelorette parties invade gay bars — a practice frequently scowled upon by gay patrons.

	











	Tierney is well aware of the Firstman drama (“He's been sending my cast apology messages, and other castmembers of that show have reached out to us and apologized on his behalf,” he says) and other critiques, all of which he waves off.


	“We as queer people need to check our messaging,” Tierney says. “The things that we decide women can or can't do can be really exhausting. Women are allowed to write about men. They're allowed to write about gay men. The question should be, how are they writing about us? Is it with empathy? Is it with allyship? Is it with kindness? Why are we looking for enemies here instead of looking for allies?”


	Back at Joy's house, at least, there is no shortage of queer allies. She has turned all of her girlfriends onto the series. They're excitedly planning a viewing party (husbands and boyfriends are welcome to join but probably won't) for the first-season finale, which airs the day after Christmas — Boxing Day in Canada.


	“I just need to get through the holiday season,” she says. “Then I can put all of my focus and energy back into Heated Rivalry.”

The Hollywood Reporter's executive editor of awards coverage goes in-depth.


							By 

	Scott Feinberg


Executive Editor of Awards


A NOTE FROM SCOTT A lot can happen in just a few short weeks.


	Since our last check-in, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences found a new broadcasting partner for the Academy Awards telecast (adios ABC and hello YouTube, starting in 2029); Netflix bought Warner Bros. for $82.7 billion (although Paramount is still trying to derail that deal and make one of its own); and there have been a ton of developments that could be harbingers of things to come exactly one month from today, on Jan. 22, 2026, when the Academy will announce the nominees for the 98th Oscars. On that third front…


	We have learned the Gotham Awards winners, the New York Film Critics Circle Awards winners, the National Board of Review Awards winners, the Spirit Awards nominees, the AFI Awards top 10 list, the Critics Choice Awards nominees, the International Documentary Association Awards winners, the L.A. Film Critics Association Awards winners, the Golden Globe Awards nominees, the Producers Guild Awards documentary nominees, the Costume Designers Guild Awards nominees, the USC Scripter Awards nominees, the American Cinematheque's Tribute to the Crafts honorees, the Society of Composers and Lyricists Awards nominees and the Oscar shortlists for 12 categories.


	Meanwhile, contenders have been hitting the campaign trail hard — among other places, at the aforementioned Gotham Awards ceremony in New York; at the Golden Globes First-Time Nominees Luncheon in Los Angeles; at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival's Kirk Douglas Award for Excellence in Film gala; and on THR's celebrated annual Roundtables, several of which have already gone live on our website (Actress, Documentary, Animation, Songwriter and Cinematographer), and the rest of which will roll out over the next several weeks.


	And, over the weekend, we finally learned some critical and commercial numbers for one of the last major Oscar hopefuls on the 2025 calendar, 20th Century's Avatar: Fire and Ash. The third installment in James Cameron's Pandora-set franchise has come in at 67 percent with critics and 91 percent with audiences on Rotten Tomatoes, and with a worldwide opening weekend gross of $345 million. For reference, 2009's Avatar came in at 81 percent/82 percent and $241.6 million, and wound up a major Oscar player, while 2022's Avatar: The Way of Water came in at 76 percent/92 percent and $441.7 million, and did not. In short, it's too early to project a trajectory for Avatar: Fire and Ash, but stay tuned.


	The bottom line: Given that the clock is about to run out on 2025, I thought that I would make my final Feinberg Forecast of the year as in-depth and explanatory as any so far. So for my projections — and in-depth explanations for them — for all 24 Oscar categories, read on. And happy holidays to you all!


PLEASE REMEMBER: Scott's forecasts do not necessarily reflect his personal preferences. His aim is not to advocate for what he thinks the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences should do, but rather to project what they will do. He arrives at his projections by screening many films, analyzing their campaigns, speaking with voters and studying relevant history and stats.


FYI A number of films have had strong showings since our last update: Netflix's Train Dreams made the AFI top 10 and landed best picture Critics Choice and Spirit noms (it looks likely to win the latter); Neon's Sirāt showed up on five Oscar shortlists (a tally bested by only Warners' Sinners, Universal's Wicked: For Good and Netflix's Frankenstein); Focus' Bugonia and Sony Classics' Blue Moon landed best pic (musical/comedy) Golden Globe noms, with the former also making the AFI top 10; and Janus' Peter Hujar's Day cracked the top five for both the best feature Spirit Award and the USC Scripter Award.


	But let's be honest, almost all indications are that Warners' One Battle After Another is way out in front of the rest of the field. Since our last update, it was awarded the top prizes of the premier LA and New York film critics groups, as well as the NBR and the Gothams, and it also landed the most Golden Globe noms and the second-most Critics Choice noms of all films. There are sizable bases of support for several other contenders — Hamnet, Sinners, Marty Supreme, Sentimental Value and Frankenstein all seem like slam-dunk best picture nominees, too — and there are still 80-plus days until the Oscars. But this is starting to feel like an Oppenheimer-esque runaway train.

FYI Paul Thomas Anderson, the presumptive Oscar frontrunner for One Battle After Another, held serve by landing Globe and Critics Choice noms and winning LAFCA and NBR prizes. But It Was Just an Accident's Jafar Panahi has made significant inroads in the wake of the Dec. 1 announcement that Iran sentenced him to prison in-absentia for making his film, which does not reflect well on the country — he has since garnered a Globe nom and NYFCC and Gotham wins for best director; plus his film made the best international feature Oscar shortlist, having been submitted by France, from which it derived financing, because Iran wanted nothing to do with it.


	Meanwhile, Critics Choice and Golden Globe voters allocated five of their respective six best director slots to the same filmmakers: PTA, Sinners' Ryan Coogler, Frankenstein's Guillermo del Toro, Sentimental Value's Joachim Trier and Hamnet's Chloe Zhao. Stipulating that both groups are comprised of journalists, and that journalists are not represented in the Academy, that's still pretty noteworthy. (The sixth Globe nom went to Panahi, as mentioned above, while the sixth Critics Choice nom went to Marty Supreme's Josh Safdie.)


	The wild card is James Cameron, whose Avatar: Fire and Ash is entering the race very late in the game. Cameron won this category's Oscar for Titanic 28 years ago and he must have come damn close to winning it again for the first Avatar 16 years ago, but he was not even nominated for it for Avatar: The Way of Water three years ago. I doubt that any filmmaker had more of a directorial challenge this year than he did, but are members of the Academy's directors branch beginning to take his work for granted and/or lose interest in the world of Avatar? We'll see.

FYI Best actor honors went from the NBR to One Battle After Another's Leonardo DiCaprio, from the New York film critics to The Secret Agent's Wagner Moura, and from the L.A film critics to Blue Moon's Ethan Hawke. DiCaprio, Moura and Hawke also were nominated for both Globe and Critics Choice awards, as were Marty Supreme's Timothee Chalamet, Train Dreams' Joel Edgerton and Sinners' Michael B. Jordan. Those are certainly notable showings — but I would just caution that only journalists determined those outcomes, and no journalists are represented in the Academy' acting branch, which solely determines the best actor Oscar noms.


	I think that's of particular concern regarding Hawke. Most journalists who vote for the aforementioned awards watch everything that's considered a contender, whereas most actors who vote for the Oscars do not, and I think that the relatively low profile of Blue Moon means that Oscar voters may prioritize other titles. For what it's worth, I'd like to urge them not to: Hawke is one of our greatest actors and his portrayal of Lorenz Hart is one of his greatest performances, albeit in a movie that is a bit like a filmed play.


	Receiving “just” Globe noms were Jay Kelly's George Clooney, Frankenstein's Oscar Isaac, The Smashing Machine's Dwayne Johnson, No Other Choice's Lee Byung-hun, Bugonia's Jesse Plemons and Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere's Jeremy Allen White. Edgerton also nabbed a Spirit Award nom.

FYI Six actresses landed both Critics Choice and Golden Globe noms: Hamnet's Jessie Buckley, If I Had Legs I'd Kick You's Rose Byrne, One Battle After Another's Chase Infiniti, Sentimental Value's Renate Reinsve, The Testament of Ann Lee's Amanda Seyfried and Bugonia's Emma Stone. (The other best actress Globe nominees, across the drama and musical/comedy categories, are Wicked: For Good's Cynthia Erivo, Song Sung Blue's Kate Hudson, Die My Love's Jennifer Lawrence, After the Hunt's Julia Roberts, Hedda's Tessa Thompson and Sorry, Baby's Eva Victor.)


	Byrne, in particular, is on a roll of landing major recognition for her performance as a working mother of a sick child. In addition to the aforemenetioned Critics Choice and Golden Globe noms, the popular Aussie alum of Damages and Bridesmaids also was nominated for a Gotham Award and is nominated for a Spirit Award, and she was chosen as the year's best actress by the NBR and both L.A. and New York's top critics groups. With those sorts of accolades, she surely a slam-dunk for an Oscar nom, no?


	Well, no. Two other actresses who, relatively recently, gave widely acclaimed performances in similarly dark comedies — Marianne Jean-Baptiste in Hard Truths last year and Sally Hawkins in Happy-Go-Lucky in 2008 — landed very similar accolades, but then were passed over by the Academy. I believe this happened — and could happen again — because journalists watch far more contenders than many Oscar voters do, and many Oscar voters turn off movies they find oppressively dark and/or with a main character they find unlikable. This could be an impediment for not just Byrne, but also Lawrence and Seyfried.


	One other note: Infiniti was tapped for the NBR's breakthrough performance prize, for which lead and supporting actors and actresses are considered.

FYI The Critics Choice and Golden Globe awards' supporting actor categories were filled out with the exact same six people: One Battle After Another's Benicio del Toro and Sean Penn, Frankenstein's Jacob Elordi, Hamnet's Paul Mescal, Jay Kelly's Adam Sandler and Sentimental Value's Stellan Skarsgård. The five eventual Oscar nominees will almost certainly come from that pool of six people.


	A few other things to consider: Del Toro, Elordi, Sandler and Skarsgård also were nominated for the Gotham Award. Skarsgård won the L.A. critics' prize. The New York critics and the NBR went for del Toro, who now seems to have lapped his own co-star, Penn, in terms of overall momentum. Elordi is probably the least well known of the lot, and his actual face is never on screen. Sandler's movie is on the least solid ground of anyone in this group, and he may lose some votes to his scene-stealing co-star, Billy Crudup.


	Make of all of this what you will.

FYI The supporting actress field appears to have narrowed considerably, of late. Critics Choice and Golden Globe voters arrived at five of the same nominees: Wicked: For Good's Ariana Grande, Weapons' Amy Madigan, One Battle After Another's Teyana Taylor and Sentimental Value's Elle Fanning and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas. The sixth Critics Choice nominee was Sinners' Wunmi Mosaku and the sixth Golden Globe nominee was The Smashing Machine's Emily Blunt. LAFCA and NBR went for Lilleaas, NYFCC went for Madigan and the Gotham Award went to Mosaku (over Lilleaas and Taylor, among others).


	Still, one cannot totally count out the likes of Regina Hall, who has the least showy part of the three principal actresses in One Battle After Another, but is a well-liked veteran and might be able to ride her film's coattails to a nom; several Spirit Award nominees, Nouvelle Vague's Zoey Deutch, Roofman's Kirsten Dunst and Hedda's Nina Hoss; the Marty Supreme gals, Gwyneth Paltrow and Odessa A'zion, and the Train Dreams gals, Kerry Condon and Felicity Jones; and perhaps Avatar: Fire and Ash's Oona Chaplin, who, for my money, was the very best part of her late-breaking film.

FYI Only two films received best adapted screenplay noms from Critics Choice, Golden Globe and USC Scripter voters: Hamnet and One Battle After Another. Frankenstein and Train Dreams were nominated by both Critics Choice and USC Scripter voters. Assuming those four films are in for Oscar noms, as I suspect they are (Train Dreams also won the NBR's prize), which adaptation is likeliest to land the final slot in the category?


	The fifth USC Scripter nom went to Peter Hujar's Day (over the likes of Die My Love, Hedda, Mickey 17, Nuremberg, Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere, Wicked: For Good and two very different Stephen King adaptations, The Life of Chuck and The Long Walk), which also led the Spirit Awards in overall noms (although, bizarrely, its screenplay wasn't one of them). And the fifth and sixth Critics Choice noms went to two films that weren't eligible for the Scripter: Bugonia, which was ineligible because it was adapted from an earlier film, and No Other Choice, which was ineligible because it's a non-English-language film.


	Those three films have to be taken very seriously. I'd also keep an eye on Pillion, which won the Gotham Award over No Other Choice, One Battle After Another and Train Dreams, among others; and Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery, considering that both of the prior two installments of Rian Johnson's Benoit Blanc franchise received screenplay noms.

FYI There are some original scripts that everyone seems to be getting behind: Marty Supreme, Sinners and Sentimental Value received Critics Choice and Golden Globe noms. Marty Supreme also won the New York film critics' prize, Sinners also won the NBR award, and It Was Just an Accident claimed both the Gotham Award and L.A. critics' laurels. It's going to be hard to displace any of those four titles from the Oscar lineup. But what of the fifth slot?


	The safest bet remains Jay Kelly, a Critics Choice nominee, not least because co-writer Noah Baumbach has a long and solid track record with the Academy's writers branch — he's previously been nominated for 2005's The Squid and the Whale, 2019's Marriage Story and 2023's Barbie. But don't count out Eva Victor's Sorry, Baby, which is coming on strong late in the game, having landed Critics Choice, Gotham and Spirit noms, and placed second in the L.A. critics' voting. (Victor is also nominated for a Golden Globe for playing the lead in the film and was tapped by the NBR for their best directorial debut award and by the L.A. critics for their New Generation award.)


	Other possibilities include, but are not limited to, Critics Choice nominee Weapons; Gotham nominees If I Had Legs I'd Kick You, The Secret Agent and Sound of Falling; and the utterly charming, Oscar-shortlisted Taiwanese film Left-Handed Girl, which was co-written by the most recent winner of this award, Sean Baker. In a fair world, Dead Man's Wire would also have a shot, but it has slipped under the radar for many voters.

FYI Members from all branches of the Academy were invited to help select 15 titles for the Oscar shortlist from 86 submissions (provided they met a minimum viewing requirement), and members from all branches are now invited to help pick five nominees from that shortlist (provided they attest that they have watched all 15 shortlisted titles).


	The shortlist includes a film from Iran that was submitted by France (this year's winner of the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or, It Was Just an Accident); Japan's highest-grossing live-action film of all time, which Tom Cruise recently championed at an L.A. screening (Kokuho); three films about troubles in the Middle East (Tunisia's The Voice of Hind Rijab, Palestine's Palestine 36, Jordan's All That's Left of You); and, for the first time ever, a film from Iraq (The President's Cake).


	The most glaring omissions from the shortlist were, to me, Belgium's Young Mothers (Music Box), Poland's Franz (Cohen Media Group) and three docs: Ukraine's 2000 Meters to Andriivka (PBS), North Macdeonia's The Tale of Silyan (Nat Geo) and Denmark's Mr. Nobody Against Putin (still seeking U.S. distribution). 2000 Meters to Andriivka and Mr. Nobody Against Putin did, however, make it onto the best documentary feature Oscar shortlist.


	It's worth noting that Spain's Sirāt appeared on five Oscar shortlists, more than any other non-English-language film; Brazil's The Secret Agent was awarded both the New York and L.A. film critics groups' prizes for best film not in the English language; It Was Just an Accident won the NBR Award and — over a field that included two other films that were eventually Oscar-shortlisted, South Korea's No Other Choice and Germany's Sound of Falling — the Gotham Award; Left-Handed Girl, The Secret Agent, Norway's Sentimental Value and Sirāt were included on the NBR's (alphabetical) list of the top five international films; Argentina's Belén, It Was Just an Accident, Left-Handed Girl, No Other Choice, The Secret Agent and Sirāt received best foreign-language film Critics Choice noms; and All That's Left of You, The Secret Agent and Sirāt received best international film Spirit Award noms.


	Something to keep an eye on is how many of the final five slots end up going to Neon-distributed films. There is a very real chance that it could be all of them, given that they include the heavy-hitters It Was Just an Accident, No Other Choice, The Secret Agent, Sirāt and Sentimental Value. That would be something!


Frontrunners1. Norway — Sentimental Value (Neon)2. France — It Was Just an Accident (Neon)3. Brazil — The Secret Agent (Neon)4. Spain — Sirāt (Neon)5. Tunisia — The Voice of Hind Rajab (Willa)

	FYI Members of the Academy's documentary branch solely selected a shortlist of 15 doc features from a pool of 201 eligible titles, and will solely select five nominees from that shortlist. The shortlist's most glaring omissions, in my estimation, were HBO's My Mom Jayne, Mariska Hargitay's beautiful film about her relationship with her mom, the late movie star Jayne Mansfield, which had been embraced by numerous other groups, including the Producers Guild; Neon's Orwell: 2+2=5, which was directed by past Oscar nominee Raoul Peck and skillfully connects the past to the present; and Nat Geo's The Tale of Silyan, which just days ago won the top prize of the International Documentary Assocation's IDA Awards.


	Netflix's The Perfect Neighbor — a study of one particularly horrific invocation of Florida's “Stand Your Ground” law, which was, for a time, the most-watched film of any sort on the streaming platform — remains the film to beat in this category. But keep a close eye on a five-and-a-half-hour film that has no U.S. distributor at all, My Undesirable Friends: Part I — Last Air in Moscow, a portrait of fearless independent journalists in Russia during the run-up to the war in Ukraine, which has tremendous late momentum in its favor. It has been vocally championed by virtually everyone who has seen it, from highly respected documentarians with films of their own on the shortlist (Oscar winner Laura Poitras of Netflix's Cover-Up) to critics groups (both New York and L.A.'s top groups of film critics chose it as the year's top doc, as did the Gotham Awards) to arts organizations (it's up for the best doc Spirit Award). And yes, for those of you wondering, Part II is currently in the works.


	Several other shortlisted docs also recently received other recognition. Cover-Up won the best doc NBR Award, while PBS's 2000 Meters to Andriivka and Apple's Come See Me in the Good Light made the group's top five list; the Spirit Award nominations also included Come See Me in the Good Light and The Perfect Neighbor; and Netflix's Apocalypse in the Tropics, the sequel to the Oscar-nominated 2019 film The Edge of Democracy, won best production and best writing at the IDA Awards.

FYI The Academy's animation branch marches to its own beat, so no precursor is a particularly reliable predictor. But it should nevertheless be noted that both Critics Choice and Golden Globe noms went to Neon's Arco, Disney/Pixar's Elio, Netflix's KPop Demon Hunters, GKIDS's Little Amélie or the Character of Rain and Disney's Zootopia 2. (The other Critics Choice nominee was Netflix's In Your Dreams and the other Golden Globe nominee was Sony's Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle).


	Moreover, the three highest-profile prizes that have already been awarded for animation each went to a different film: The New York critics went with KPop Demon Hunters, the L.A. critics went with Little Amélie or the Character of Rain, and the NBR went with Arco. Zootopia 2, meanwhile, is laughing all the way to the bank — it has grossed $1.27 billion worldwide, the second-most of any 2025 film, and a half-billion more than the year's next highest-grossing animated film, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle.

FYI Members of the Academy's casting directors branch chose 10 films for this category's inaugural shortlist and will solely determine this category's five inaugural nominees after being offered the opportunity to view excerpts from the shortlisted films and pre-recorded interviews with their casting directors in L.A. and London on Jan. 9 and in New York on Jan. 10, 2026.


	The Critics Choice Awards, which is also introducing a casting/ensemble category for the first time, nominated Hamnet, Marty Supreme, One Battle After Another, Sinners and Wicked: For Good, as well as a sixth film that did not make the Oscar shortlist, Jay Kelly. The casting award at the American Cinematheque's Tribute to the Crafts went to Sinners.

FYI Members of the Academy's cinematography branch chose 16 films for this category's shortlist and will solely determine the five nominees.


	Precusor recognition has been largely split between Sinners and Train Dreams. Sinners was the pick of the New York critics and the NBR, while Train Dreams was the selection of the L.A. critics and for the American Cinematheque's Tribute to the Crafts' cinematography award, and landed a Spirit Award nom. Both films also received Critics Choice noms, as did F1, Frankenstein, Hamnet and One Battle After Another.


	By the way, so much for the Camerimage Festival, which celebrates cinematography, helping to predict the best cinematography Oscar: This year's first-place winner at the fest, the Swiss film Late Shift, didn't even make the shortlist; however, the runner-up, the German film Sound of Falling, did.

FYI This is one of the hardest Oscar categories to predict. There is no shortlist. And there are only a few precursors, none of which are particularly helpful.


	Voters for the Costume Designers Guild Awards nominate work in three different areas, whereas there is no such distinction at the Oscars. (This year's CDG nominees for work in contemporary film are Bugonia, F1, One Battle After Another; Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery and Weapons; for work in period film are Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale, Frankenstein, Hamnet, Hedda and Sinners; and for work in sci-fi/fantasy are Avatar: Fire and Ash, How to Train Your Dragon, Thunderbolts*, Tron: Ares and Wicked: For Good.)


	Critics Choice voters nominate six films, but frankly, don't really know much about costume design. (Our picks this year were Frankenstein, Hamnet, Hedda, Kiss of the Spider Woman, Sinners and Wicked: For Good).


	And then there's the costume design award from the American Cinematheque's Tribute to the Crafts. The winner of that was Hedda.


	The one thing you can usually count on the Academy's costume designers branch to do is to not nominate work on films that are set primarily in the present. Costumes tailored for the past, the future or an imagined world are far likelier to make their cut.

FYI Members of the Academy's makeup artists and hairstylists branch solely selected 10 films for the shortlist and will solely pick five nominees from the shortlist after being offered the opportunity to view excerpts from the shortlisted films and interviews with the artists behind them on Jan. 10, 2026.


	Critics Choice nominations went to Frankenstein, Sinners, The Smashing Machine and Wicked: For Good (as well as two films that did not make the Oscar shortlist, 28 Years Later and Weapons). Frankenstein won the American Cinematheque's Tribute to the Crafts' hair and makeup award.

FYI Members of the Academy's music branch chose 20 scores for this category's shortlist from 132 options and will solely determine the five nominees.


	The Society of Composers and Lyricists, which includes many music branch members, nominated six scores from studio films and six scores from indie films for awards. All of its nominees for the former are also on the Oscar shortlist (Bugonia, Frankenstein, Hamnet, One Battle After Another, Sinners and Wicked: For Good), but the same is true of just one of its nominees for the latter (Train Dreams).


	The Oscar shortlist also includes all five scores that received both Critics Choice and Golden Globe noms — F1, Frankenstein, Hamnet, One Battle After Another, Sinners — as well as the other Critics Choice nominee, Marty Supreme, and the other Golden Globe nominee, Sirāt. Sinners also was the runner-up for the L.A. critics' honor and won the American Cinematheque's Tribute to the Crafts' score award.


	Finally, a word about the score of Sirāt, which is unlike any that has ever been nominated for an Oscar. Its French-born/Germany-residing composer, Kangding Ray, is a specialist in electronic, techno, underground, rave-type music, original pieces of which are performed both within and over the action of the film. It has been cool to see Ray's work recognized not only by Globes voters, but also with prizes from the Cannes Film Festival and the L.A. film critics; and to see Sirāt shortlisted not just for the score Oscar, but also for the sound Oscar, given how closely Ray worked on integrating the score with the fim's overall soundscape. As Filmmaker magazine wrote of Sirāt, “Few recent films have offered such an overwhelmingly immersive audiovisual experience.”

FYI Members of the Academy's music branch chose 15 songs for this category's shortlist from 65 options and will solely determine five nominees. That's great news for songwriters who branch members have long known and loved, as demonstrated by past recognition — among them Mark Ronson, Andrew Wyatt, Ludwig Göransson, Stephen Schwartz, Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross and especially Diane Warren, who the branch is poised to recognize with her ninth consecutive — and 17th overall — nomination in this category.


	Warren was shortlisted this year for a song (“Dear Me”) from a little-seen documentary (MasterClass' Diane Warren: Relentless), the score of which the branch also shortlisted. Hers is but one of four shortlisted songs from docs: The others come from Come See Me in the Good Light (“Salt Then Sour Then Sweet”), Billy Idol Should Be Dead (“Dying to Live”) and Viva Verdi! (“Sweet Dreams of Joy”).


	It will be interesting to see how the branch handles the two films that landed multiple songs on the shortlist this year: Sinners, with “I Lied to You” and “Last Time (I Seen the Sun),” and Wicked: For Good, with “The Girl in the Bubble” and “No Place Like Home.” At each of the last two Oscars, a single film — Barbie and Emilia Pérez — wound up with two songs among the final five, including the eventual winner. But vote-splitting is also a possibility, which begs the question: Is F1, which had three songs in the running for the shortlist, but got only one on the shortlist, “Drive,” actually in a better position to advance a song to the next round?


	I'll note that a bunch of the shortlisted tunes have been landing recognition elsewhere in recent days. The Society of Composers and Lyricists, which includes many music branch members, nominated six songs from dramatic or documentary films and six songs from comedy or musical films. Five of its six nominees for the former are also on the Oscar shortlist (“Dear Me,” “Drive,” “Last Time (I Seen the Sun),” “I Lied to You,” and “Salt Then Sour Then Sweet”), as are three of its nominees for the latter (“The Girl in the Bubble,” “No Place Like Home” and Oscar frontrunner/American Cinematheque's Tribute to the Crafts song award honoree “Golden” from KPop Demon Hunters).


	Meanwhile, Critics Choice and Golden Globe noms went to “Golden,” “The Girl in the Bubble” and “I Lied to You,” plus “Train Dreams” (Train Dreams). The other Globe noms went to “No Place Like Home” and “Dream as One” (Avatar: Fire and Ash), while the other Critics Choice noms went to “Drive” and a song that did not make the Oscar shortlist (“Clothed by the Sun” from The Testament of Ann Lee).


	Lastly, I'll just point out that there are a lot of big names who performed this year's shortlisted songs in the films for which they are nominated — among them Sara Bareilles, Brandi Carlile, Billy Idol, Ariana Grande, Cynthia Erivo, Miley Cyrus, Ed Sheeran, Nine Inch Nails, Nick Cave and Ke$ha — as is the case almost every year, which is why I keep urging the Academy to rent out the Hollywood Bowl or the Greek for a night of performances of the shortlisted songs for members of the music branch, plus others. It would be one of the hottest tickets and coolest concerts of the year. Maybe in a couple of years, once the YouTube money kicks in, they will actually do this!

""The people I was most concerned about, the people that I had the deepest pain for, were my wife and my kids,"" he says. ""Because my kids would see me sitting in a corner, you know, I couldn't even move.""


							By 

	Kimberly Nordyke


Managing Editor, Digital


	Alec Baldwin says he had suicidal thoughts after charges were filed a second time in the fatal shooting on the set of his film Rust.


	The actor appeared on the most recent episode of Dopey: On the Dark Comedy of Drug Addiction, a podcast hosted by Dave Manheim, where he talked about battling some dark thoughts during that time. Baldwin said he was in a rough place mentally after it was announced that he was going to be charged a second time in the fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of Rust in 2021. (The case was ultimately dismissed, and he cannot be retried.) Baldwin said he was concerned about the impact it was having on his family.

	“The people I was most concerned about, the people that I had the deepest pain for, were my wife and my kids,” he said. “Because my kids would see me sitting in a corner, you know, I couldn't even move.”

	Baldwin said there was a period where he took a nap every day for a year due to his mental state.


	“And I don't want to dwell on this, I just want to say that this was very painful for my wife and my family, my sisters and brothers and so forth, my colleagues.… And I can tell you, it broke every nerve in my body, spiritually, financially…work-wise, my career, my wife, my kids, my friends, my health. I mean what it's done to my health. I mean, if I told you what my health conditions have been since October 21st of 2021…it's taken 10 years off my life. It's taken at least 10 years off my life,” he added, noting the date of the fatal shooting.

	











	Baldwin said he was able to get through it thanks to his wife, Hilaria, and his family, but not before some really dark thoughts took over.


	“When you get to that point where you go, ‘I don't want to wake up another day, I'm gonna go' — I swear to God, I mean, to talk about it, and it's really kind of unappealing to me because to talk about killing yourself and to actually kill yourself are two so profoundly distinctive things. I think a lot of people, I think countless people think about killing themselves and ending their life, and then very few do. And for me, I remember, I used to lay there in bed and go, ‘Oh God, I can't wake up another day and have it be the same. It's the same every day. And I can't do it.' But somehow I found the faith in God to, you know, not kill myself tomorrow. Let's wait one more day.”


	Baldwin also said that he believes that the production followed the regulations laid out by the Hollywood guilds but the prosecutors in New Mexico “came along and said, ‘Oh no, no, those rules don't apply here, and we have our own rules here and that's what applies here. So we're going to put you on trial for those rules.…' No one came to me in the first week we were handling firearms. No one came and told me anything different. It was after the fact. All the rules were changed after the fact, and that was very scary to me. I thought they were going to make it up as they go along.”


	He added that the New Mexico prosecutors “wanted to get their names in the paper. That's what they wanted. And I mean, thank God for this judge who called in on them and said, you know, what you're doing is reprehensible.”

	











	In the same interview, the subject turned to President Donald Trump, whom Baldwin portrayed on Saturday Night Live for four years. Baldwin admitted that he didn't “want to play Trump every weekend for four years” but did it due to his friendship with SNL mastermind Lorne Michaels.


	“Overall, it was a good experience. Those first two years were glorious, and but you look at people who are made fun of on SNL. Comedy is all about mockery now. It's all about mockery,” he said, noting that very few comedians aren't “mean-spirited,” citing Ray Romano as one example. But, he said, much comedy these days veers toward being “negative.”


	“But you look at Trump. And you say to yourself, ‘Trump's a human being,'” Baldwin said. “Now, do I disagree with Trump about everything? I disagree with Trump about fucking everything. Every fucking thing you could imagine I disagree with him. But at the same time, he's a human being, and his mistake was when he was wounded, when he was hurt, when he was dismissed, when he was mocked, when he was outed or whatever, in any way he was treated badly, what was his response? What was his response? And that's the lesson for all of us. What's your response? Do you just try to get up and clean yourself off and move forward? No, Trump is bitter. He's filled with hatred. He's filled with bile, and he only made it worse for himself. 


	“I mean, Trump is a person who thought, ‘All of you have a problem. All of you making those observations about me, you're the ones that are wrong. I don't deserve any of this.' Trump doesn't believe he deserves any of what's been ladled out against him. Now, has he been mistreated in some way or has it been too much of a pile on. Maybe, I don't know. I mean, I think Trump, occupies a very unique place in our history, but at the same time, I think that you gotta walk that line. Trump's a human being.”

	











	Baldwin recalled being at a dinner party and sharing his belief that comedy about Trump is “over” — not because it's scary, but because “it's just done.”


	“What else can you possibly say? If you're still watching a nighttime talk show and laughing at jokes about Trump, there's something wrong with you,” Baldwin said. “All we need to do is just get ready for the next election, get ready for the midterms. That's all you need to focus on. Fuck Trump. He's gonna be gone.… And Trump, had he only had one ounce of self-awareness, how different things might have been.”

John Malkovich gives the theater adaptation of Suzanne Collins' wildly popular dystopian series some star power, playing President Snow in pre-recorded snippets at a 1,200-seater purpose-built venue.


							By 

	Lily Ford



	If you've been to London recently, you'll have likely heard about The Hunger Games: On Stage.


	Plastered on billboards, across buses and filling our TikTok feeds are ads for the city's hottest new theater ticket: A seat in The Hunger Games arena, in a world-first adaptation of Suzanne Collins‘ smash-hit dystopian franchise that sees 24 children offered up to a totalitarian dictatorship and made to kill one another for sport.




	Adapted by Conor McPherson and directed by Matthew Dunster, the enthralling, 2.5-hour production is a feat of engineering, technology, choreography, illusion work and just about every possible creative department you could think of. Harness-clad tributes fly across the room and fight to the bloody death in  the center of the purpose-built Troubadour Canary Wharf Theatre. Created just for The Hunger Games: On Stage, the venue features a handful of sub-stages, swivelling audience seating and complicated rigs that are used to suspend its performers and props 30-odd feet in the air.

	The play also has something The Hunger Games franchise isn't in any need of: star power. John Malkovich plays the stone-cold President Snow in pre-recorded videos that bookend the arena, looming over the show's Katniss Everdeen in a crisp, white suit.


	Enter Mia Carragher. The young, Liverpudlian actress lands her first major role in Dunster's production after some years spent training at the prestigious Tring Park School for the Performing Arts in Hertfordshire, England. The daughter of Liverpool Football Club legend Jamie Carragher, the 21-year-old is making a name for herself on her own terms — and not letting that Scouse accent slip one bit.

	











	“Honestly, it came quite naturally, which I was quite glad about,” the performer tells The Hollywood Reporter about nailing Katniss' American accent. “The other day, our associate director said, ‘We've done 50 shows' And I was like, ‘What the hell?' You don't even think. It literally just comes out of your body.”


	It's all muscle memory for Carragher now: The sprinting, the climbing, the archery, all in between monologuing as a petrified, underestimated Katniss and sharing intimate moments with her Peeta Mellark (Euan Garrett). She admits to being “obsessed” with Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson's Hunger Games performances — and, in what might have been something of a good omen, even worked with the latter on a film last year — but her rebellion-sparking sharpshooter isn't an imitation of Lawrence's Katniss.


	“I wanted to make it my own and see what I could do with the character, but also, with the material that I had and how we were performing it — on stage and in the purpose-built theater — there was no other option than to have a different version of [her],” Carragher explains to THR.


	Below, the actress talks about the making of The Hunger Games: On Stage and the buzz around the show. She reveals some of the A-list stars to have come and watched, which sequence is the trickiest to get right each night and why fans are flocking to see how this world-renowned tale can be told in front of a live audience: “There's people that have traveled from America just to come and watch — it makes you think, ‘This means so much to so many people.'”

	











Hi, Mia! I'd love to know about your relationship to The Hunger Games books and films. Were you a fan before this role came along?


	Yeah, I was a fan of the films and I'm obsessed with Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson's [movies]. I would re-watch them all the time. I remember they were on Netflix for a while. I think they've been taken off Netflix now. It's one of those films that, no matter how many times you've watched it, it's like, “Oh, let's just put it on again.” You can never get bored of it. So then when the audition came about, I was like, “What?” At first I was so curious [about] how they were going to do it on stage. And then when the audition came through, that's when I was like, “Oh my god, I need to read these books as many times as possible to prep.”


What was the timeline there? When did you first hear that they were holding auditions for it, and when did you find out you'd got it?


	It was in January. So I was on holiday in Thailand, and I think the audition came through and it was for the day after I got back from Thailand. The whole last week when I was on holiday, I was trying to prep as much as I could, but it was just a movement call, so I didn't get any sides [a few excerpts from a script] or anything. I just knew that if I was going to read, it was going to be for Katniss. So when I went into the movement call, I tried to just embody her.


	And I think— I mean, it did go well, because then when I was on my way home, my agent rang me and said, “Can you read tomorrow for Katniss?” I was like, “Oh my god!” And then my mum and dad were in London for Valentine's Day, and I crashed and stayed in their hotel. [Laughs.] Then I read, and it went well. A couple weeks later, I read again, then we did a fight call, and that was with Kev [McCurdy], our fight director. And again, I went into that trying to embody Katniss in the fights. After that we did harness work. I mean, you've seen the show — I need to be good [at] flying and things. Two weeks later, I got the call.

	











Oh wow. I mean, I know you've got a background in performance — you went to Tring, so you've got dancing, singing, all of it under your belt. When you were in the early rehearsal stages for this show, was the physicality daunting or just exciting?


	Even at first when I read the script, I don't think I realized. Because obviously you're just reading stage directions and script and then going in the rehearsal room and seeing how physical it was gonna be… But I was kind of excited, because all my training could be used for this role.


Do you remember the moment you found out you'd got the role?


	Yeah. I had some kind of idea. You just get a little feeling… I couldn't explain it. I've maybe had it with other things before, but never this much. And then a couple days before, Matthew, the director, followed me on Instagram. And then I was checking to see who he follows, and he'd followed a couple of other people, and I was like, “Maybe they've got it.” It was two days later, I took myself on a walk because I couldn't think straight. I didn't know what to do. And my agent called me — both my agents, on a joint call. I think I was like, the street away from my house. So I sprinted home, and then FaceTimed my mum and dad. I was so excited.


Is this your first theater role?


	I've done other, smaller bits. But this is my debut in professional theater.


So what kind of prep went into your Katniss? Because this is maybe quite a different Katniss to Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss.












	Yes!


Did you want to make it different?


	In my head, I wanted to make it my own and see what I could do with the character, but also, with the material that I had and how we were performing it — on stage and in the purpose-built theater — there was no other option than to have a different version of [her]. You've got the inner monologue, the talking to the audience, which I really enjoyed. Before rehearsal, I did as much as I could: reading the books, trying to get as much information [as possible]. But then in the rehearsal process, I think I really just found my way with the script, written by Conor McPherson and then Matthew Dunster, the director. Being in the space, especially, I think helped all of us a lot.


Did you rehearse in the theater?


	We did six weeks in a studio, and then we had quite a long tech [rehearsal]. It was three or four weeks of tech rehearsal. On the first preview, we did a dress rehearsal. That was the day of the first preview. And that was the first time we'd ever done the play as everything all together, because it was so tech heavy, it took us so long to put it all together.


It really is impressively tech-heavy. There is so many things to think about at once and whoever is in charge of that operation has nerves of steel. Before we discuss, a quick note on your very convincing American accent. As a scouser no less! Did you have a coach? 


	I actually went to New York to study acting at [the] Lee Strasberg [Theatre & Film Institute]. So I was around a lot of American people there. While I was there, I did accent lessons to help with the American accent, because we do a lot of scene work, and because people were American, I'd try and match it. I think I'm a big listener, so listening to that helped me.

	











	For this, we did have an accent coach, but to be honest, it was on very little things where it was little words that I needed to make sure that I was saying the proper American way, so no one was like, “She's not American.” But honestly, it came quite naturally, which I was quite glad about.


Is it muscle memory now you've done it so many times?


	It's so funny, I think the other day, our associate director said, “We've done 50 shows.” And I was like, “What the hell?” You don't even think. It literally just comes out of your body.


There's the tech, art, props, choreography, so much to think about. How many months were you in rehearsal and who were the formative voices through the decision-making of shaping such a physical show?


	So we began rehearsing at the beginning of August, and then the first preview was the 20th of October. So nearly three months.


That's not even that long!


	It's actually not. And we're creating a whole new play. So I was really thankful [that] Matthew, the director, he had a really strong idea of how he wanted everything to go. And I'd done a couple workshops before rehearsal. They had a strong plan about what they were going to do when we went into it, which I think was super helpful. We also had a movement director, Charlotte Broom, our fight director Kev and we had an illusions [creative, Chris Fisher] — every possible department. Then we'd all come together in rehearsal. But obviously, Matthew always made the final decision. It was crazy to see in previews how much [the show] changed.

	











What do you mean by that?


	I think the first preview was nearly three and a half hours long. We cut, like, 45 minutes off the play. So in previews, when we're performing of a night, we'd be there all day chopping and changing things around. So the beginning is I come up from sub-stage by myself. But at first it started with all of the tributes coming up, and we did a distorted version of the beginning of act two, where we're in the games and it was shown as a nightmare scene. Then one day we just came in and they were like, “Yeah, that's not the beginning anymore.” And we were all just, “Oh, okay!”


Something that I was so impressed with was everyone's fitness. I was thinking about you guys just running around for three hours.


	The first time we did it, I was dead. Like, exhausted. And there's moments where I'm running around and then I have to stop and speak for ages. The first few times I was like, “I don't know how I'm gonna speak, I'm so out of breath!” But I think I've definitely got play fit. My body knows everything that's happening now, so I've definitely gotten used to it. But sometimes, even when we have just the one day off a week, and then we go back to do it on the Tuesday, I'm like, “God, that was hard just having one day off.”


Which sequence do you find the most stressful?


	I think the beginning of act two…


The fight at the cornucopia?


	Yeah, there's so many different fights. So as well as doing your own fight, you have to be so aware of what's going on around you. There's blood packs [used], so there's blood all over the floor. There's a few times where a few of us have actually slipped, because we haven't looked down to see where the blood's been splattered. And then, when the tracker jacker nest comes down.

	











It's so clever, but I am sending thoughts and prayers to whoever is in charge of health and safety! What's your favorite sequence?


	The bit that really stands out to me is the bit when Thresh lets me go. Obviously, there's emotional bits [of the show] and sometimes it can be hard to reach that state every night. But that is always a moment that gets me where I don't even have to try too hard to get to an emotional point. It's near the end of the play as well and I think my body knows I'm nearly there. [Laughs.]


Have you been pleased by the reaction to the show?


	Anyone that I've met outside after the theater, at the stage door, or people [who have] messaged me… I've had the nicest messages. And I think the ones that really mean the most to me is a lot of young girls, when they come to watch and they say, “Oh, that's what I want to do when I'm older,” or, “You've really inspired me,” or “Katniss has showed me that I can do this.” They're the messages where I'm like, “Oh, my god, that is so lovely.” And every time I see younger people in the audience, if I'm finding it hard that day, it keeps me going.


The Hunger Games IP is so popular, so it's no wonder people have been flocking to it. When you were rehearsing, did you know you were making something that was going to attract so many fans?


	I knew it was going to be so cool and loads of people there, but there's people that have traveled from America just to come and watch this specifically. I'm like, “What?” Or people just traveling from other countries, or even coming down from Scotland just for the day to come and watch. And it makes you think, ‘This means so much to so many people.'

	











I think it also really helps to have John Malkovich there — that big name attached. Did you get to meet him?


	Yeah, I did. In our scenes we talk, but obviously he's on the screen. So when he went to record it, we stood behind the camera and read the lines and that was just so cool. We were all like [widens eyes], but he was so nice to everyone. We were all a bit nervous, but he made everyone feel comfortable.


If you could play any other character, though, who would you choose?


	God, we like to say this all the time. Who would we want to be? This is so not possible, but I think Caesar [Flickerman] just seems like such a fun role. The interaction with the audience. I think Clove, one of the tributes, is a really cool role as well. I think Cato and Clove have a lovely relationship, and I think it's really shown in our play as well.


You're right. She has her knives, which is very cool. But Katniss has her bow! Did you take archery lessons for this?


	Yeah, I did. I did a few weeks of a course before I moved to London, and then, it's so funny — the other day, the people who taught me archery traveled from Liverpool to come watch. I was literally shaking while I was doing it. I was so scared they were gonna be like, “That's wrong!”


You made it look so effortless. I was trying to figure out how all of the illusions were done — including with the bow — but it really speaks to the work of the prop department, the illusions team. Everything is so meticulously choreographed and designed.












	There's so many. You will have seen the openings in the floor and things coming up, and we can't leave anything in the wrong place on stage, because it could be covering a trap on the floor, and then they'd have to do a show stop because they can't go into the next scene if we've left something there by accident.


Have you had to do show stops?


	[Nods.] There's a moment with the career tributes where a campfire comes up and someone had accidentally left a prop on it, so they couldn't bring the campfire up. And then when Rue comes on and she's like, “The smoke from the campfire!” it's kind of like, ‘Oh, this doesn't make sense.' Yesterday we had a show stop because when the bags come down, there's the moment where Thresh lets me go and he comes from the ceiling. And something happened with the wire so he couldn't get down. But it's really important for him to get Clove off me in that scene. There's no other way we could go about it. So they had to stop.


How do you find that? Are you just told to stay put? “Technical issues”?


	Yeah, sometimes you feel like you're so into it, and then it's like, ‘Wait, did I just hear something?' Then you hear the stage manager being like, “Stop, stop, please leave the stage.”


Fascinating. Do you have a favorite costume? There's some crackers when you're in the Capitol.


	The interview dress is really gorgeous. And then the chariot one is really cool as well. That skirt that I've got on has plugs coming out of it. So then when I do get onto the chariot, me and Euan, who plays Peeta, we literally get plugged into it so that the smoke can come out of us and we light up.

	











Is it a real fire?


	It's smoke and then with the lights, it gives it an orangey tone, so it looks like fire. But when the floor and everything goes on fire, we can really feel the heat, even when we're on the chariot.


I'm assuming you are not scared of heights…


	No. [Laughs.] I mean, in tech rehearsals, sometimes when we do it with the house lights on, that would scare me more in a way. But when it's dark, I've got so many other things to think about when I'm that high up.


Has anyone famous come to see the show?


	Ian McKellen came the other day. It was funny, no one knew he was there. And then in the beginning of act one, I went off for a quick change, and someone was like, “Ian McKellen's here.” But I was so confused… Euan was like, “He's on this row. Look there.” That was so cool. And then on press night, Lily Allen came, which was really cool, because at the time we were all listening to her new album on repeat.


Did you get to meet any of them after the show?


	We went and told our company manager, Kate, that Ian McKellen was there. Then after the show, she went up to him and said, “The cast would love to get a picture.” So he came and met us backstage.


How lovely. The production has probably been helped as well by the buzz around Sunrise on the Reaping. Have you read it yet?


	No, I haven't read it yet, but I'm really excited to watch the film.


You need to read it before you watch!


	I should, because I've spoken a lot to Josh [Lacey], who plays Haymitch [in the production]. I am really, super excited. In this play, we have a lot of Easter eggs to the other books. When Effie says, “Happy Birthday!” to Haymitch and things like that. I am really excited. I'm going to make sure I read it before I watch it.

	











Have you met any of the cast members from the films?


	I met Josh Hutcherson because I did a film with him. It was a few months before I did the audition for this, it was a film called Let's Love by Jamie Adams. It was an improv film, and I just had a small role, but I had a scene with him. In [the scene], I had to get a picture with him. It was so funny. When I found out I'd got the role, I was like, ‘I swear I've got a picture with Josh Hutcherson.' I found it on my phone.


Finally, then, when does the show end?


	Most of our contracts are for a year.


What would the dream be for after this? Would you want to take it to Broadway, or do something in TV and film?


	I think I'll always be connected to this in a way. And if it did go to Broadway or New York, I'd so be like, “Please take me!” That'd be so fun. But no, I'd love to do TV and film as well and I still would love to do stage. Honestly, anything. But I think because of how fulfilling this role is, I'd want to do something that really fulfilled me in every aspect.

""You walk out changed"": The intimate venue has launched careers from Garth Brooks to Taylor Swift — and continues to define Nashville's songwriting culture.


													By
												

	Taylor Mims


Writer


	People have tried bribing their way into The Bluebird Cafe. For an independent venue tucked away in a Nashville strip mall, The Bluebird has folks trying to get in at all hours of the day just to get a peak at the storied space that has been instrumental in the careers of giants like Garth Brooks, Taylor Swift and many more.


	“I would be counting money on a Sunday morning and people would be banging on the door having to get in,” says Bluebird Cafe COO and GM Erika Wollam Nichols. “When I wouldn't let them in, they came around the back and started waiving $20 bills at me and I'm like, ‘No!'”


	The enthusiasm would seem outsized for an 86-capacity club five miles outside of downtown Nashville that hasn't seen much renovation beyond sound system upgrades and regularly changing the carpet. But – like many independent venues that have survived the turbulent live music industry for more than four decades – its allure is in the lore.


	Before any stars graced the stage, The Bluebird Cafe was a 100-seat restaurant opened by Amy Kurland in a former drugstore turned poolhall in 1982. According to Wollam Nichols (who worked as a waitress at the cafe during her years at university), Kurland's “goal was to make good food, but she also loved music.” Kurland's father was an established violinist who created a group of string players for hire in Nashville and helped instill in Amy a love and appreciation for hardworking musicians.


	The Bluebird's small stage helped local artists be seen and, on the cafe's first anniversary, the first musician who regularly appeared there secured a deal with Mercury Records. Originally, the artists were amplified by speakers until an acoustic set was booked and changed the course of the venue.


	“Amy noticed that it just worked in the room – that acoustic music, everybody listened,” Wollam Nichols says. “And it was like, ‘wait a minute, something is going on here with this.' The size of the room, the fact that people are sitting and listening and the way that the songwriters were really needing to be heard – that all factored into it. It was an organic recognition.”


	Soon after that, The Bluebird moved to hosting simply acoustic shows – two shows a night, seven nights a week. By 1984, the venue began holding auditions for songwriters to perform on Sundays for the Writers' Night and, a few months later, songwriters Don Schlitz (“The Gambler”) and Tom Schuyler (“16th Avenue”) decided the best way to make people listen would be to plant the writers themselves in the middle of the room surrounded by the audience. Wollam Nichols explains, “You wouldn't be able to talk quite as easily if everybody is sitting at your elbow.” And the now legendary In The Round sessions began.


	The In The Round format leaves nowhere to hide in the 2,100-sq. ft. space – for both the artists and the audience. “It is a room that is really built for very obvious feedback,” Wollam Nichols says. Everyone must be locked into the performance (audience chatter will be shushed). The songwriters must be compelling.


	“I see people come into this room and have no idea what to expect, what's happening. They're confused. They are a little bit unnerved,” Wollam Nichols says. “They've booked a couple of seats. Maybe they are seated at a table with people they don't know. The writers are sitting beside them. I've seen Vince Gill hand his guitar to somebody sitting next to him. They'll put a drink on somebody's table.


	“Then the music starts, and they start to become drawn into that experience, and they walk out changed. People will say, ‘I've never heard music like this ever before. This is the greatest experience I've ever had at a show in my life.' And that's always really gratifying.”


	That experience is expertly curated by The Bluebird staff that started hosting auditions back in 1984 to ensure only songwriters who could hold a crowd sat in the middle of the room. Auditions are held four times a year on a Sunday morning with roughly 60 songwriters who come to see a panel of judges including Bluebird staff, label folks, publishers, professional songwriters and theater people.


	Songwriters have one minute to impress the panel.


	“The structure of it was something that Amy created because she felt like after a minute of a song, if you didn't like it, you would change the radio station. So, you need to get people's attention within the first verse/chorus of a song,” Wollam Nichols explains. “It's not the most perfect system, but it's decent.”


	The songwriters are evaluated: one to five on song, one to five on performance, and a notes section for additional thoughts. It takes about a month for the evaluations to be compiled and completed, and six to eight writers usually pass. Those writers become eligible to play on Sunday nights for the six-writer set and once they perform well at four of those nights (this usually takes two years), they can be booked for the 6pm In The Round sessions. Artists including Kenny Chesney, Carolyn Dawn Johnson and Dierks Bentley successfully passed their auditions.


	The only other way onto the In The Round stage is by invitation. If an artist is invited to perform at the late show four times by the songwriters who have passed, that counts as four auditions. Taylor Swift made it onto the In The Round stage by invitation in 2004 and, as a young songwriter, “held her own” on a stage with three grown men, Wollam Nichols says.


	The Bluebird has a reputation for welcoming talent early in their careers. Faith Hill, Trisha Yearwood, Guy Clark, Townes Van Zandt, Janis Ian, The Indigo Girls and many more have showcased their talent at The Bluebird.


	When Garth Brooks played The Bluebird in 1987, he had been passed on by every Nashville label. “A record executive, Lynn Schults (from Capitol Records), who had passed on him heard him play a set at the Bluebird – saw the impact he had on the room and took him into the kitchen and said, ‘I think we missed something,'” Wollam Nichols tells Billboard.


	“Garth is top notch,” Wollam Nichols says. “He really is the best friend you can have in an industry. He never forgets. He honors what he's been gifted.”


Vince Gill feels similarly. ““To this day, if I run into Vince, the last thing he always says to me is ‘let me know if you need me.' That's incredible loyalty that people have and it's a loyalty that we don't take for granted,” she adds.


	Four years after Kurland transferred ownership of The Bluebird to the Nashville Songwriters Association International in 2008, the venue's popularity skyrocketed with the hit ABC drama Nashville starring Connie Britton and Hayden Panettiere. Show creators made a replica of The Bluebird – going as far as taking the headshots off the wall of the original, scanning them and placing them in the same spots on the show version – and fans from across the globe made the original a tourist destination.


	“We would have 300 people in the parking lot trying to get in. They wouldn't leave,” says Wollam Nichols, who took over as GM when NSAI became stewards of the venue. “Then they would yell at us because ‘we weren't managing things properly.' And it's like, ‘you're the one standing in the middle of the road. I don't know what you want me to do because you won't leave and we can't let you in because we are full.'”


	The notoriety gave The Bluebird the ability to not only constantly fill seats, but also sell a lot more merch to keep the small venue – which remains a for-profit business run by a non-profit entity – afloat. Ticket sales go straight to the performers' pockets, so the venue makes money from food and beverage, limited sponsorships and merchandise.


	With seats often filled with mostly tourists, some songwriters felt the Bluebird had sold out. But Wollam Nichols argues that the ethos of the venue hasn't changed. The Bluebird was created for songwriters to have their voices heard and now those songs are being heard by people from all walks of life.


	“The intimacy that [The Bluebird] experience creates opens people up and they become maybe a little more friendly, a little more thoughtful,” Wollam Nichols says. “I have seen grown six-foot-three men in tears walking out of that room and that's always best.”

	The first trailer for Christopher Nolan‘s feature take of Homer's The Odyssey is here, and yet the highly anticipated movie has already sold out 70MM Imax tickets at AMC and Regal cinemas.


Matt Damon is seen here as Odysseus, King of Ithaca, leading his soldiers home after the Trojan War. There's barely a glimpse of a monster in the trailer, but per the poem which is set around eighth century BCE, he faces Polyphemus the Cyclops, Sirens, the nymph Calypso and the witch goddess Circe in the treacherous oceans. If anything, there's a lot of ocean and a lot of shipwreck with Odysseus and troops inside the Trojan Horse.

	











	We get a glimpse here of Tom Holland as Odysseus' son Telemachus, and Anne Hathaway as Odysseus' wife Penelope. “Promise me you will come back,” says Penelope.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“What if I can't?” responds Odysseus. 


Also starring, but not seen in the first go-round of the trailer, are Robert Pattinson, Zendaya, Lupita Nyong'o, Charlize Theron, Mia Goth, Benny Safdie, Jon Bernthal and John Leguizamo.

A remake of Troy..
Got it..

Technically a sequel, since the story takes place after the fall of Troy.

Troy was about the Trojan war. This is set after it. And unlike that Brad Pitt film, they actually go up against gods and monsters!

I recommend The Return with Ralph Finnes instead.

Much less interested…now.

Hopefully we can understand the dialogue

For Nolan, the score and the soundscape ARE part of the dialogue. Either you buy into that approach or you don't 🤷‍♂️

I'd rather not have to watch a Chris Nolan film with closed captioning but if you want to hear the dialogue, not just the score, you have no choice.

Matt Damon is maybe the worst possible choice to play a rugged and brilliant Greek general. Talk about soft.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


EXCLUSIVE: In a year that was heavy with horror, for a minute it appeared as though Blumhouse and Atomic Monster were on a stale streak, particularly when sequel M3GAN 2.0 didn't live up to the blockbuster status of the first 2023 film. But in the end, the genre label is having the last laugh, err scare, as all eight of their productions combined to gross $1.022 billion at the global box office for calendar year 2025. That's the first time as a combined company that the Blumhouse and Atomic Monster slate has made more than $1B. By the way, that's off of combined production costs of $204M before P&A. Talk about profitable.

	











	Blumhouse and Atomic Monster's merger was made official in January 2024. The previous best box office year was 2023, with four Blumhouse movies —Insidious: Red Door, M3GAN, Five Nights at Freddy's and Black Phone— raking in $821.9M. Atomic Monster's Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom and Nun II made combined close to $710M worldwide.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Here's how this all breaks down as some of the titles aren't with Blumhouse's home distributor Universal. The bulk of Blumhouse-Atomic Monster's gross is with the New Line finale (but is it really the last one?) Conjuring: Last Rites which minted $494.6M, the best ever in the franchise besting The Nun‘s $366M global take. It's also the only Conjuring movie to have grossed north of $400M WW. The Patrick Wilson-Vera Farmiga starring, Michael Chaves directed R-rated horror movie reps 48% of Blumhouse-Atomic Monster's 2025. The Conjuring is the highest grossing horror franchise ever through eight titles which have grossed $2.57 billion. Last Rites launched in the post-Labor Day weekend which Warner Bros has turned into a rich launch pad for horror films going back to 2017's It.












	Second, pushing the Jason Blum and James Wan label over $1 billion, is Universal's Five Nights at Freddy's 2 with $201.8M global, $108.9M of that made domestically. The sequel, also directed by Emma Tammi, went pure theatrical instead of theatrical day and date on Peacock like the 2023 movie. The original movie finaled at $291.5M WW. The Five Nights at Freddy's franchise is nearing a half billion at the global B.O. 


	Third is Scott Derrickson's Black Phone 2 with $132.1M WW, which was also Blumhouse-Atomic Monster's third highest No. 1 opening stateside of the year ($27.3M), behind Conjuring Last Rites (best in franchise with $84M) and Five Nights at Freddy's 2 ($64M, a record opening for any movie in the post Thanksgiving/early December frame). All in the Black Phone franchise counts $293.5M. Black Phone 2 opened on Oct. 17 and it repped actor Ethan Hawke's fourth collaboration with Derrickson after the Sinister series. 


	Fourth is NEON's The Monkey based on the Stephen King short story and directed by Oz Perkins, which grossed $68.8M global ($39.9M domestic). The movie opened on Feb. 21 and followed twin brothers Bill and Hal who find their father's old monkey toy in the attic. A series of gruesome deaths start and the brothers decide to throw the toy away and move on with their lives, thus growing apart over the years.


	While M3GAN 2.0 didn't work at $39M global ($24.1M domestic) next to the original's hot $180M, it still gets Blumhouse and Atomic Monster to big numbers for the year. Leigh Whannell's Wolf Man was next with $34.1M worldwide ($20.7M domestic), followed by the Brandon Sklenar and Meghann Fahy starring April 11 date thriller, Drop, with $28.7M WW ($16.6M domestic), while Woman in the Yard after a March 28 theatrical release grossed $23.3M (96% of that made stateside).   


	First release for Blumhouse and Atomic Monster in the New Year is Lee Cronin's The Mummy via New Line on April 17.

					By Dade Hayes 

Business Editor


Paramount on Monday amended its hostile bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, adding an “irrevocable personal guarantee” from Larry Ellison in support of the $108 billion proposal.


WBD last week raised a range of concerns about the offer, noting it had already formally accepted a bid from Netflix for $82.7 billion.


	Ellison, one of the world's richest men, has long been a backer of Skydance, which is run by his son, David. While the elder Ellison is a participant in the proposed WBD transaction, the board of WBD had expressed worry that it was via a trust that could technically be manipulated in unpredictable ways. As a result, Paramount's bid comes with “illusory” financial guarantees, WBD said.

	“Larry Ellison has agreed to provide an irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion of the equity financing for the offer and any damages claims against Paramount,” Paramount said in an SEC filing.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The financial value of the Paramount offer, at $30 a share, is not being amended as part of Monday's actions.


	In an interview with CNBC on Monday, RedBird Capital's Gerry Cardinale, who has backed Skydance and now is a principal in the proposed WBD deal, said WBD's concerns about Larry Ellison were a “red herring.” Nevertheless, he said, “we have taken that off the table.”


	Paramount also said it was upping its breakup fee (the amount it would pay if a deal does not close) to $5.8 billion from $5 billion, matching Netflix. Larry Ellison has also agreed not to revoke the Ellison family trust, Paramount said, or “adversely transfer its assets during the pendency of the transaction.”

	











	The Ellison family trust owns about 1.16 billion shares of Oracle common stock, Paramount said,, adding that “all material liabilities” of the Ellison family have been publicly disclosed.


	In announcing the multi-part amendment to its offer, Paramount criticized the conduct of the merger process. It asserted that “none” of the WBD board's concerns, “nor the demand for a personal guarantee, were raised by WBD or its advisors to Paramount in the 12-week period leading up to WBD agreeing to the inferior transaction with Netflix.”


	The battle for WBD will reshape the entertainment landscape regardless of who prevails. Both suitors also are likely to invite a high degree of scrutiny from regulators. Just weeks before its chase of WBD became public, Paramount had closed a long-gestating deal to merge with Skydance.


	Paramount's offer is for all of WBD, including its legacy cable networks. Netflix, by contrast, aims to acquire only the studio-and-streaming division that houses Warner Bros. and HBO. WBD had been planning a split into two companies in 2026. Netflix intends to allow the split to go forward before taking over the studio-and-streaming portfolio.


	In its latest update, Paramount said it was also extending the deadline for shareholders to January 21 from January 8.


	“Paramount has repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to acquiring WBD,” Paramount CEO David Ellison said. “Our $30 per share, fully financed all-cash offer was on December 4, and continues to be, the superior option to maximize value for WBD shareholders. Because of our commitment to investment and growth, our acquisition will be superior for all WBD stakeholders, as a catalyst for greater content production, greater theatrical output, and more consumer choice. We expect the board of directors of WBD to take the necessary steps to secure this value-enhancing transaction and preserve and strengthen an iconic Hollywood treasure for the future.”

WBD and Shareholders, please take a look at what's going on at 60 Minutes and CBS News.  This could be what happens at CNN if the Paramount deal moves forward.

The Bari Weiss episode should give everyone pause

No one should own WB. It should be a stand alone company.

Netflix buying WBD would be a disaster and the end of the theatrical experience as we know it.  Ellison needs to win for the sake of the industry.

Who are you trying to kidd here? Ellison is a Trump lacky who censors and tries to control anything that is critical of Trump. The Bari Weiss, 60 minutes story is proof of that. 

Netflix is the lessor of the two evils here.

Trump supporter

Paramount needs to just stop. WBD doesn't want trump to dictate their films and content. It didn't fare well with Germany and Hitler. Larry should not have aligned with the dictator.

Welcome to Rendering, a Deadline column reporting at the intersection of AI and showbiz. Rendering examines how artificial intelligence is disrupting the entertainment industry, taking you inside key battlegrounds and spotlighting change makers wielding the technology for good and ill. Got a story about AI? Rendering wants to hear from you: jkanter@deadline.com.


This edition: As YouTube‘s purge of AI-fuelled fake movie trailers is celebrated, we consider why Hollywood studios did not take action sooner against the nuisance videos.


	“They took down Screen Culture? Jesus f***ing Christ YouTube, that's the best Christmas present you could have given us.” That was the view of one Reddit poster after Deadline revealed last week that YouTube had shut down Screen Culture and KH Studio, two of the most prolific fake film trailer channels on the internet.

					YouTube Shuts Down Channels Using AI To Create Fake Movie Trailers Watched By Millions		
			








	This person was far from alone. One thread featuring our story had 43,000 upvotes in the movies subreddit. Over on X/Twitter, the aggregator account Culture Crave posted the news, getting more than 4M views. The engagement on these posts was overwhelmingly celebratory, with people hailing the decision as long overdue and a “rare win” for YouTube.


	Screen Culture and KH Studio were active for years, persistently posting fake movie trailers that spliced together official film footage with generative AI embellishments. The two accounts had well over 2M followers and more than a billion views between them. For India-based Screen Culture, it was an enterprise, earning millions of dollars in revenue.


Deadline wrote a deep dive on the channels in March, revealing that they were gaming YouTube's algorithm and duping users into thinking they were clicking on official trailers. 


	YouTube took note, initially banning ads on the channels because they were misleading viewers. Both changed their ways, adding clarity to video titles, so instead of labeling trailers “new” or “first,” they were described as “fan” or “concept” trailers. Quietly and slowly, however, they returned to their old ways. When we flagged this to YouTube earlier this month, it terminated the channels, citing violations of its spam and misleading metadata policies.

	











	Screen Culture and KH Studio are dead because of a technicality, not because of their liberal use of generative AI, or because Hollywood studios demanded they be purged for exploiting IP without permission. The former is hardly shocking, given the volume of AI slop that now sloshes around the internet. What is more surprising is that the major studios did not take action sooner.


	While there have been piecemeal takedowns or monetization strikes, Screen Culture and KH Studios' growth shows that studios were not systematic in their approach. In fact, as we revealed in March, quite the opposite. Instead of tearing down videos, Warner Bros. quietly claimed Screen Culture's ad revenue on AI-fuelled trailers for Superman and House of the Dragon. We found examples of Sony and Paramount doing the same thing. 


	What makes this even weirder is that while Warner Bros. was pocketing cash from Screen Culture videos that used Midjourney to deepfake Superman, Warner Bros. would later sue Midjourney for deepfaking Superman.


	When approached for comment earlier this year, Warner Bros., Disney, Paramount, Sony, and others declined to explain why they were letting fake trailers slide. Even the studios' trade body, the Motion Picture Association, stayed silent. 


	In this vacuum, all we can do is speculate on the reasons for this curious phenomenon. Money? Seems unlikely, given the revenue claimed from Screen Culture was little more than loose change. Free marketing? Fan-made trailers are as old as YouTube itself. Some are appreciated as an art form in their own right. All can help promote a movie.


	But what Screen Culture did was industrial, and there is evidence its videos were harmful, diluting official trailers and enraging legions of YouTube users who thought they were clicking on the real deal. 


	Another explanation for the unchecked rise of fake film trailers is that policing IP in the age of artificial intelligence is complicated, and there are still inconsistencies in approach. The technology is so ubiquitous, and the rights theft so systematic, that cracking down on all infringement must be like a dog chasing its tail. 


	Studios are picking their battles and hoping that they can make enough noise to send a message. It is no coincidence that, fresh from partnering with OpenAI, Disney let it be known that it sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google, claiming that the tech giant's AI models infringe on its copyrights on a “massive scale.”


	Google listened, taking down dozens of videos from YouTube featuring Mickey Mouse and Deadpool. But there are plenty of other examples on YouTube, not least the surging fake trailer channel Teaser Universe, which has amassed millions of views for AI Avengers: Doomsday trailers, sold to viewers with titles that make them look official.


	That Screen Culture and KH Studio's demise has been so widely celebrated suggests Hollywood should be paying more attention to fake trailer farms. As one Reddit user put it: “This is the one thing that finally has all of fandom in agreement.”

AI is here to stay.  Get used to it, or pack up your kitbag and head on down the road.

Many of those trailers looked better than the ones released and plus some of them were not only fantastic, but hilarious.  In some cases they gave what the public wanted or expected and not what some “visionary” makes.
I think the oldest out there is the Neuromancy fake trailers pastiched from various cyberpunk sources, though not AI.
One thing that Hollywood can't do is legitimately threaten them because its fair use, especially when it's parody.

I love that site and fake trailers ruck Hollywood and the old bitch men who run it we will destroy it fuck you

Fuck AI and any scumbag who uses it to make a buck and screw others who use their own human brains to make shit. That simple, you turds

That you don't think it takes brains to do something with AI says everything about you, none of it good.

I don't think fake trailers should be completely banned, but they should be clearly labeled as AI fake and royalties should be paid to rights owners.

that is the kind of apologist excuse that ai supporters always go to.
sounds like you have never created anything of your own in your entire life.

A wrinkle in time.

Reese Witherspoon's three children looked all grown up in new holiday photos posted by the actress via Instagram on Sunday.

“Making Merry ❤️✨🎄,” the “Morning Show” star, 49, captioned the social media upload over the weekend.

The Oscar winner kicked off the carousel with a smiling shot of herself and lookalike daughter Ava, 26, in festive ensembles.

The “Big Little Lies” alum shimmered in a sequined dress, while her eldest child paired a black turtleneck with a sparkling skirt.

Later in the slideshow, Witherspoon snapped a mirror selfie with her 22-year-old son, Deacon, who grinned with his hands in his pockets.

The Emmy winner concluded the post with a photo of her family's gingerbread house, as well as a snowy selfie with her youngest son.

Tennessee, 13, sported a black hooded jacket zipped to the top in the sweet shot.

Ava commented on the upload, writing, “🥰☃️.”

Witherspoon welcomed Ava and Deacon while married to her first husband, Ryan Phillippe, from 1999 to 2008.

She co-parents Tennessee with Jim Toth, whom she divorced in 2023.

The “Wild” star is currently in a relationship with German financier Oliver Haarmann.

The duo was photographed packing on the PDA during a yacht trip in St. Tropez over the summer.

Witherspoon was first linked to Haarmann in 2024, with a source telling People she was “taking things slow when it comes to dating” because her career and family are her “biggest priorities.”

By the following May, Page Six learned the pair was eyeing a New York City apartment together.

Brooklyn Beckham blocked his family on social media because his mother, Victoria Beckham, “liked” one of his posts.

The former Spice Girls singer reportedly double-tapped the photographer-turned-chef's post about him roasting a chicken, the US Sun reported Sunday.

In the post, Brooklyn, 26, discussed how to give the chicken extra flavor through beer-brining.

The “like” from Victoria, 51, caused an influx of fans to fill Brooklyn's comments section, begging for him to make amends with his family.

The annoyed “Cookin' With Brooklyn” star then blocked his mom, as well as his dad, David Beckham, and brother Cruz within hours.

The outlet also reported that Brooklyn had blocked his other siblings, Romeo and Harper Beckham.

A source told the US Sun that David, 50, and Victoria are “understandably heartbroken by what's gone on here.”

“This came out of the blue for them, and in the lead-up to Christmas when families are supposed to come together, it's devastating,” the insider shared.

“All they want is for things to be fixed but with every week they just seem to be getting worse. Unsurprisingly, Cruz and Romeo are furious that Brooklyn would make such a public attack.”

The source claimed Brooklyn wants his family issues “fixed in private and not played out on social media, although his actions have resulted in quite the opposite.”

Page Six has reached out to reps for both Brooklyn and Victoria for comment, but did not immediately hear back.

Over the weekend, Cruz, 20, took to Instagram to shut down reports that his parents had unfollowed their eldest child on Instagram.

“NOT TRUE. My mum and dad would never unfollow their son,” the “Optics” singer wrote alongside a screenshot of an article.

“Let's get the facts right. They woke up blocked … as did I,” Cruz added.

In October, a source told Us Weekly that Brooklyn had “no interest” in making amends with the Beckham family right now.

He “really focused on living a peaceful, drama-free life” with his wife, Nicola Peltz, 30.

Alix Earle showed off her toned figure with multiple bikini shots following her breakup from Braxton Berrios.

The influencer turned 25 on Dec. 16 and celebrated with a girls' trip to Cabo. Earle shared pics from the getaway on Instagram, including her flaunting her figure in a black bikini while soaking up the sun on an outdoor couch.

More sexy shots included her lying down in a black bikini in front of balloons that spelled Alix, and her posing in a brown and white printed two-piece.

The newly single influencer also wore a silky pink backless minidress that resembled lingerie during one night out celebrating with her pals.

The activities included enthusiastically hitting a piñata, as well as enjoying a cake made out of hot dogs with birthday candles on top.

“Birthday of my dreamssss #25 🌸💕🏝️👙🫦🤸🏼,” she wrote.

Earle and Berrios split earlier this month after dating for two years. A source told Page Six that the influencer and the NFL athlete's breakup was mutual and “distance induced.”

The former “Dancing With the Stars” contestant and the Houston Texans wide receiver's lives were headed in different directions when it came to their future, a source also told Us Weekly.

Earle “really wants to spend more time in LA, while Braxton lives in Florida,” the insider said.

The pair “realized they were growing apart as a couple” as they spent less and less time together, the source added.

Earle tearfully addressed their breakup in a TikTok last week.

“We have been doing long distance since, basically, June and we haven't got to see each other that often. It's just been really difficult for me,” she shared with her followers.

She said she still considered Berrios, 30, her “best friend.”

“A part of me also really wants to be focusing on myself right now. I just feel like I can't be what Braxton needs,” she noted, admitting she's considered moving to Los Angeles permanently.

“I want him to have someone who can be there for him 24/7 and support him. He wasn't really expecting that of me … I constantly felt guilty,” she continued.

She stressed that there was no drama involved.

“It's not because he did anything wrong or I did anything wrong,” she said. “It just didn't really feel like it was working out, in the moment.”

Berrios and Earle were first romantically linked in May 2023 after he called it quits with ex Sophia Culpo a few months prior.

Pete Davidson's tattoos appeared dramatically faded in a new shirtless pic of the comedian holding his newborn daughter.

Davidson's girlfriend, Elsie Hewitt, shared the photo of him holding their daughter, Scottie, on Sunday. Davidson enjoyed skin-to-skin contact with his baby girl, gently cradling her while she was swaddled in a blanket.

The “Saturday Night Live” alum has been vocal about undergoing a painful and long process of removing the majority of his tattoos and in the new pic, it's clear a lot of his previous ink has already faded.

Hewitt captioned the sweet pics of them holding their newborn, “MY BEST FRIENDS🩷🩷🩷.”

The model gave birth to Scottie on Dec. 12, sharing the happy news on Instagram.

She also revealed they named their baby girl Scottie Rose Hewitt Davidson — a nod to Davidson's firefighter dad, Scott, who died during the September 11 terrorist attacks.

“My best work yet, i am absolutely overflowing with love and gratitude and disbelief,” she wrote. As for Davidson, he added, “wu tang forever.”

This marks the couple's first child. They've been dating since early 2025.

In January, Davidson said he was only planning to keep two or three of his 200 tattoos during an appearance on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.”

“I've been burning them off,” he said. “They burn off a layer of your skin, then it has to heal for six to eight weeks.”

“You can't get in the sunlight,” he added. “And then you've got to do it, like, 12 more times.”

One tattoo he does plan to keep is the one of Hillary Clinton on his right leg that he got after the politician lost the 2016 presidential election.

Davidson, 32, revealed that Clinton actually checked that he wasn't removing his tattoo of her when he started getting his tattoos erased in 2020.

“What was cute is when I got them removed, she hit me up and she's like, ‘You're not removing me, are you?'” he recalled during his appearance on “The Breakfast Club”. “I was like, ‘Of course not, of course. Hillary stays.'”

“She loves it,” he added.

Davidson bluntly shared that the tattoo removal process “sucks.”

 “If anyone is actually thinking about getting a tattoo, I would recommend thinking about it for a couple of years because your feelings change, you know?” he shared.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","I Love LA heads to New York in a busy season finale","https://www.avclub.com/i-love-la-season-1-finale-recap-i-love-ny","Mon, 22 Dec 2025 05:07:00 GMT","

It's funny and fitting in a way that a series titled I Love LA would move its season finale to New York City (and offer I Love NY as its onscreen title). Will Maia, Alani, and Tallulah (Rachel Sennott, True Whitaker, and Odessa A'zion) find themselves in an I-heart-NY state of mind? Or will they find their trip to the Big Apple basically a confirmation of why they enjoy living in sunny L.A.?

Maia, of course, is ready to embrace New York City. She's already wired and anxious and speed-walking through Lower Manhattan, talking a mile a minute about how she's fine with the seven day no-contact agreement she made with Dylan (Josh Hutcherson). She's manic (obviously), and it's funny how both of her friends read that in diametrically opposed ways: Is this healing or is this concerning? Either way, Maia is not paying much attention to what's around her. She's ready to text Dylan in a very grown-up way and let him know that, uh, her plane landed fine. He would want to know that, right?

He does. Or, rather, his thumbs-up text suggests he does. Which, to Maia, is basically an insult. It's enough to make Maia (sporting a nice blowout and a little black dress) continue to pick up smoking as her NYC vice.

You do wish Maia had more levelheaded friends to help her through this ordeal. Instead, Tallulah fuels her friend's manic episode by complaining about Dylan's chivalry (which she's always found borderline offensive), all while projecting the kind of scenario Maia needs to believe is true: “He's obviously having a mental breakdown on the inside,” she says, which…well, more on that later.

As the two arrive at the Antoine fitting for the Formé dinner, it's clear they're in uncharted territory. Surrounded by professional models and assistants (equally aloof and scathing in their disdain for anyone else, really), Maia and Tallulah find they're not in Kans—er, Los Angeles anymore. There are no sunny smiles here. Just indifferent scowls.

Antoine is perfectly cordial as he hands Tallulah the dress for the dinner, which ends up being a simple black one that's chic and fits like a glove. Considering our Ritz Cracker/bag thief girl was hoping for a big fashion moment (she's looked around and seen plenty of eye-catching numbers), she can't help but be disappointed. Not that Antoine will hear any of it: “You're not a model. You just do your funny videos and steal things.” She should just be happy she's invited.

If you know Tallulah, which he clearly doesn't, that's not what you want to tell her, especially as she and Maia know this dinner could be their ticket to leveling up. And that's rarely done in an elegant black dress. Which is why, as Maia bores the models on break nearby, Tallulah steals what looks like a wildly revealing green dress and heads straight for the door, pretending nothing of note has happened.

Meanwhile, in Los Angeles and sent on Dylan duty, Charlie (Jordan Firstman) arrives to find Maia's maybe-still-boyfriend rearranging spices while listening to heavy metal. His version, we assume, of a manic episode. Offering an unlikely shoulder to rely on, Charlie insists the two talk out what's going on, bro-style. Just as Tallulah gives incredibly bizarre-sounding advice to Maia (all while perhaps misreading the situation, even if occasionally offering welcome pearls of wisdom), Charlie is both wildly helpful and also borderline chaotic. Yes, he knows Maia needs constant validation, but to sum the intricacies of Maia's own texting philosophy (Charlie cannot believe Dylan just thumbs-upped her text!) as “bitches be crazy” feels both on-point and unhelpful.

Charlie is better once he decides what the two need is some role playing (wig included, naturally). What would Dylan say to Maia if she was right there. What insecurities about their relationship would he voice? What fears and anxieties about how he feels he's not her priority would he feel emboldened to say out loud? Plenty, obviously, but as it turns out the role-playing skit is most helpful for Charlie, who's clearly using it to work through his own relationship issues with Andrew (the fuckbuddy he'd lost to a Din Tai Fung date). Which snaps them both back into action. What Dylan needs is to go wild! 

So, what would he most want to do with this break? Charlie is obviously hoping for a wild night out. Dylan, though? He wants to watch the Ken Burns Vietnam doc. We all heal in different ways, right?

Because, across the country, Maia is healing in a decidedly different way. Eating out with Alani and Tallulah (at a place Ben himself recommended), she's relishing being an uninhibited New York City girl. Which is put to the test when Ben (wearing a ring, as Alani breathlessly admires) approaches their table (super chic, right outside on the sidewalk) and basically talks down to them all (he even outright calls Tallulah a small fish in a big pond), quickly setting the tone and stage for what will happen. He's leaving his credit card at the bar. Why don't they all keep drinking on his tab and then he can go pick it up at the hotel room the next day?

It's the perfect scenario for what Maia has in mind for her own wild evening (she wants to be a “babe, pig in the city”) and hilariously, we're deprived of knowing just how wild the night is. We only see the results: blood on the sheets in their hotel bed as Maia and Tallulah learn they got matching tattoos (“The Nightmare Before Business” which apparently will be Maia's company name?). They'll both get them lasered off when they get back to L.A. but this does bring up one tiny problem: Tallulah isn't wearing a gorgeous black dress to the Formé event. The green dress she stole is, to quote Maia as she holds it up to scrutiny, “so fucking backless!” It's a nightmare. What will Antoine do when he realizes Tallulah stole this dress? 

Maia goes into crisis mode and realizes the only one who can help her is…Charlie, who makes the mistake of putting Maia on speakerphone, in hopes she'll talk about how much she misses Dylan and how beat up she is over it all. Oh how wrong. As ever, Maia is in a crisis of her own making, unable to think beyond her job, which drives Dylan away. Charlie is blunt: Antoine will not be happy. But perhaps he can help. (He is better with dresses than he is with interpersonal stuff.)

Thankfully, Maia at least gets a bit of a break to make her indecent-proposal moment with Ben happen in her hotel room. He's as much of a sleazebag as we know he is (he was dining out with his wife just the night before when he went over to Maia's table!), and it's clear this is all a power move. He asks Maia to touch herself for him, while he spits on her. She's to do what he wants while he stays inviolate, watching her: “I'm not gonna fuck you today.” (Not literally, at least.) But he does offer a job (and a $400,000 salary!) and insists they work with Tallulah together. 

You can see Maia slowly realize this is not what she wants. The blurred lines between the sexual fantasy and the reality of that kind of work relationship feel impossible to discern. It's a fascinating conundrum, especially wrapped up in a character who is still figuring out how messy she's allowed to be and who put herself in this very awkward situation to begin with (where consent and agency are thorny, tricky things to untangle). 

And so she's wondering whether she can even say no to the offer. After all, Tallulah would kill her if she doesn't take it. But Maia is done being underestimated and taken for granted and feeling like she needs to use her agency (or lack thereof) as a way to get ahead. And so we get our final friendly advice courtesy of Charlie: just lie. After all, that's what leveling up in this world is all about. (Is he the worst of them?)

Which is what she does: In her telling, Ben only offered Maia a job if she dropped Tallulah as a client, which, obviously she refused (much to Tallulah's joy and outrage). Sigh. And so all is well, as they get dressed for the dinner only to find the entire block around them is gridlocked because a crazy person stabbed a famous person (uh, that would be Alani's dad, who got stabbed by his stalker, whom Alani had been fooled to believe was her father's mistress).

But traffic won't keep them from her dream fashion moment. They know better. They'll walk the streets and take the subway (while “Dreams” by The Cranberries plays in the background). At the same time, we see Charlie arriving at Andrew's workplace with some Din Tai Fung (“You know I could be basic, too”) and, in a greater shocker, Dylan waking up next to Claire. 

Not that we dwell too much on that. The focus, as ever, has been on Maia and Tallulah. As they race into the subway, we get a quintessential NYC scene: two gorgeous girls in beautiful dresses set against the craziness of the train, including the gem that's enough to snap them out of their dreamy haze. “I think you both look beautiful,” a guy tells them, “but my rat thinks you're sluts.”

“I miss L.A.,” Maia says in quiet defeat, giving us the kind of cliffhanger sitcoms of yore used to give us, and which we had to wait months (and not a year, as we do these days) to see how it would all get resolved. Will they make it to the dinner? Will Antoine care about Tallulah going rogue with her dress? Will Dylan tell Maia what happened with Claire? Will Charlie and Andrew try and make it work? Will Alani get a meatier subplot worthy of Whitaker's dry comedic talents?

What happens when Tyler Hynes' devoted fans — lovingly known as the Hynies — get to see the Hallmark superstar shaking his…well…heinie? Naturally, they lose their ever-loving minds. Footage captured by filmmaker Jennifer Silliman, who's heading up production on a documentary about Hynes' fandom, has understandably sent them over the moon. 

Silliman told EntertainmentNow she was in the right place at the right time on December 18, 2025, to capture Hynes participating in a hilarious booty-shaking challenge at the Hallmark Christmas Experience in Kansas City. As soon as she shared the video online, fans swarmed the post with cheeky comments, swooning over what they'd just seen.

Silliman was in Kansas City to shoot footage with fans for the Hynies documentary, due for release in 2027, and was front and center when Hynes participated in a Reindeer Games challenge that required him to use his, um, assets. 

The “Christmas Above the Clouds” star and other Hallmark hunks had boxes tied around their waists, filled with plastic balls and a cut-out hole on top. The goal was to move around so much that all of the balls in their boxes would pop out, aiming to be the first with an empty box. 

Silliman had the ideal vantage point, filming as Hynes shook, danced, gyrated, twerked, and basically set the Westin Hotel ballroom on fire as his teammate, fellow Hallmark star Rachel Boston, cheered him on. Afterward all was said and done, he smirked and apologized to the camera. 

Silliman told EntertainmentNow, “As the director of the Hynies documentary, I've learned to always keep the camera rolling — because Tyler Hynes has a habit of delivering iconic moments when you least expect them. I just happened to have the best seat in the house for that one.”

Silliman posted the video of Hynes to social media on December 19, with Ludacris' “Money Maker” as the soundtrack, and wrote in the caption, “Hallmark did NOT warn us about this part of the reindeer games. 👀”

Her video has quickly racked up thousands of likes and hilarious comments from fans on Instagram and Facebook, including one that said, “CHRISTMAS CAME EARLY OMG 😂🥵”  

Another quipped, “Not sure what I just watched. But Thank you. 😂❤️😂”

Someone else wrote, “Watch again. Watch again. Watch again. Watch again”

Though we hear Hynes technically didn't win the competition, his fans are sure to agree with the Hynie who commented, “OMG, that's a freaking winning performance if I ever saw one, 😂😂😂😂👏👏👏❤️🔥🔥🔥”

Was in the audience during that show with my wife ….to say the least it was a new side she saw of Tyler. Oddly I didn't hear any complaints hmm

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","HGTV's David Bromstad Bravely Opens Up About Healing Childhood Trauma","https://entertainmentnow.com/hgtv/david-bromstad-childhood-trauma/","Mon, 22 Dec 2025 01:21:27 GMT","

HGTV star David Bromstad bravely opened up about dealing with substance abuse issues during the special “My Lottery Dream Home: David's Happy Ending,” explaining how childhood bullying led to depression. 

Bromstad, 52, was mid-renovation on this Florida dream home when a major storm nearly destroyed the progress he had made. According to the “My Lottery Dream Home” star, he “got into some unhealthy behaviors” due to the stress.

“Back when I was a teenager, I didn't deal with what really happened,” he explained during the Friday, December 19, speical. “I was exactly this amount of gay, this amount of perfect, but that was not celebrated, that was looked [at] in a different way back then.”

Bromstad continued, “I was super depressed. I was super bullied. And so for me to idealize my childhood was a complete defense mechanism that was beautiful; it saved me.”

The house suffered extreme water damage and mold that required remediation, which essentially set him back to square one.

Bromstad explained that after the storm destroyed his dream house, he saw his “childhood fantasy” as “broken.”

“I decided it's time. I need to put my house on hold and I need to check myself into some sort of program,” he recalled. “I need to talk. I need to climb out of this hole. I need to understand why I climbed into it in the first place.”

The longtime HGTV star reached his milestone 50th birthday after leaving treatment, saying, “I could not be more grateful for every aspect of my existence.”

“I've earned every wrinkle and grey hair. Mentally, emotionally and spiritually content. It's been the most unique year of my life,” he shared via Instagram from his trip to Norway in August 2023. “Learning to love myself, warts and all, has been the hardest and most beautiful process.”

He added, “I decided to celebrate in Norway to see how my ancestors lived and the air they breathed. Being here has answered so many questions about why I love the things I do. It was a perfect day hiking, kayaking and communing with nature and all her glory. Thank u for allowing me another trip around the sun.”

Bromstad credits his childhood traumas for shaping him into the man he is today. 

“I think it's important for people to understand that I'm human, that I struggle, that I am innately a bright and shiny person,” he told TV Insider ahead of the premiere. “And that version of myself came from past childhood traumas, and that version of myself saved me back then. It got me the job on HGTV, it has propelled so many unique and beautiful versions of myself, until it started to destroy me. Because it's unsustainable for someone to be that authentically happy. You can't have the bright and shining times without the darkness. I don't push away the darkness. I bring it in because I know the darkness only makes my bright and shiny parts shine that much bigger.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Amy Schumer Hints About Hitting ‘Rock Bottom' After Confirming Separation","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/amy-schumer-hints-rock-bottom-separation/","Mon, 22 Dec 2025 17:03:35 GMT","

Amy Schumer is offering a rare and candid look at how she and her family are coping after confirming her separation from husband Chris Fischer, emphasizing the role of humor and togetherness even when life feels hard.

The comedian's heartfelt reflections came as she celebrated the final night of Hanukkah, turning a moment of personal challenge into an honest and relatable message about resilience.

During a Hanukkah celebration shared on Instagram by author and activist Noa Tishby, Schumer spoke openly about how her family leans on humor to get through tough times.

“When things are at their absolute worst is when my family is the funniest,” she said. “Just when we hit rock bottom is when we can laugh the hardest.”

She added, “I think that that's not unique to me, I think that's like a Jewish characteristic.”

The holiday season — which often centers on warmth, light and reflection — offered Schumer a backdrop to express both her faith and her gratitude.

“I love Hanukkah. I was always really excited about it. Every time we light the candles, I feel like we've won,” she added.

Schumer also spoke about the importance of Jewish pride and community during challenging times, describing it as “the only way to fight against antisemitism.”  

In a separate post to her Instagram Story, Schumer shared a quote by author Hannah Rosenberg that touched on the power of friendships and support networks.

The message celebrated the significance of deep bonds with loved ones — friendships that offer both laughter and strength when facing hardship. “My life is filled with the souls of women I love… who show up on my doorstep to celebrate and grieve,” the excerpt read.

Schumer's choice to share the quote underscored her belief in community and connection during periods of difficulty.

Schumer, 44, confirmed earlier this month that she and Fischer, 45, are ending their seven-year marriage — a decision she described as amicable and rooted in mutual respect.

In her announcement on Instagram, she wrote, “Blah blah blah Chris and I have made the difficult decision to end our marriage after seven years. We love each other very much and will continue to focus on raising our son,” referring to their 6-year-old son, Gene.

She also asked for privacy as they navigate this transition.

Schumer and Fischer married in 2018, and welcomed Gene in 2019.

Their separation comes after years of public and private milestones, including collaborations on “Amy Schumer Learns to Cook” and the HBO docuseries “Expecting Amy.”

Schumer was careful to note earlier this month that the split was not tied to speculation about her weight loss or other personal factors but was instead a mutual decision.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Beloved Producer Spike Lee Shares Heartbreak Over Tragic Passing of ‘Dear Brother'","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/spike-lee-tributes-james-ransone-passing/","Mon, 22 Dec 2025 11:42:17 GMT","

Beloved filmmaker and actor Spike Lee is among those who led the tributes for late actor James Ransone, who died on Friday, December 19, by suicide, the New York Post reported. Ransone was 46. 

Ransone is survived by his wife, Jamie McPhee, and their two children, but many others he touched through his work or who knew him personally are also grieving. 

Lee posted a photo of himself and Ransone on Instagram. They are posing at an event, with Ransone's arm around Lee, and they stare into the camera. In the caption, he shared his thoughts. “Rest In Peace To My Dear Brother, MR. JAMES RANSONE,” Lee wrote. “We Rocked Together On RED HOOK SUMMER And INSIDE MAN.” 

“Red Hook Summer” is a 2012 drama film, and “Inside Man” is a 2006 crime thriller starring Denzel Washington. Lee turned off his comments, but the post has been liked over 20,000 times in a few hours by fans and celebrities who have shown their support after Ransone's tragic passing. 

Some of Ransone's memorable roles include work in “The Wire,” “Generation Kill,” “Treme,” “Bosch,” and “It: Chapter Two.” In the latter film, he bonded with co-star Bill Hader. In a 2019 interview with Anthem magazine, the actor revealed that their close bond stemmed from their humor and the “darkest parts” of their personalities. 

Ransone was asked about Hader, with the interviewer noting that they appeared to have a “special bond.” Did they know each other before starring in the film “It: Chapter Two?” Ransone played Eddie Kaspbrak, and Hader played Richie Tozier. The late actor shared that they had met at an audition for the 2009 film, “Public Enemies,” starring Johnny Depp, before noting their similarities. 

“I think Bill and I share really similar sensibilities about what we think is funny, what music we like,” he said. “On top of that, I think we had very similar backgrounds growing up, too. It's very much the same with Isaiah Mustafa, too. I think that really helped. My sense of humor falls very much into ‘South Park.'  I just think that (expletive) so funny—anything super irreverent that's going to make everybody else super (expletive) off. And the more absurd it gets, the better. It just makes me so happy.”

He continued, “The other thing is that, when I saw Hader in Toronto, we sat down and we immediately started talking about the darkest parts of our personalities. Usually, the funniest people have the most (expletive) up backgrounds.”

Ransone had discussed some of his struggles and his background in interviews. He approached challenging topics with honesty and authenticity, and he overcame many obstacles and challenges, including abuse and addiction.

There's nothing we love more than a sub-sub-subgenre, and Christopher Nolan‘s much-anticipated next film, “The Odyssey,” is already putting a major stake (or a big-ass sword?) in its particular designation: it's “a mythic action epic,” and now that we've finally got a look at its first trailer, it's hard to argue with that.

Based on Homer's “foundational saga” (as in, you read it in school and probably didn't quite jibe with it, but all that is about to very much change), Nolan's latest was shot entirely using IMAX cameras, and its incredible scope is already on display, even in just a two-minute look. This first look leans on the inherent drama and pain of the titular odyssey, including a few chilling deaths and a closer look at the leadership on display by our primary hero.

The film stars Matt Damon as as Odysseus, the mythical Greek hero who spends a decade trying to return home after fighting in the Trojan War. The cast also features Tom Holland as Odysseus' son Telemachus, Anne Hathaway as his wife Penelope, and Mia Goth as Melantho. The film also stars Zendaya, Robert Pattinson, Lupita Nyong'o, Benny Safdie, Charlize Theron, Jovan Adepo, Jon Bernthal, John Leguizamo, and Elliot Page in currently undisclosed roles (though Jennifer Lawrence joked to us that Pattinson is playing one of the sirens).

 










The feature is billed as a reimagining of the iconic Greek epic about hero Odysseus who spends a decade trying to return home after fighting in the Trojan War. Homer's “Odyssey” is believed to have been compiled around the 8th century B.C.E.

Earlier this year, Nolan told Empire magazine about the many elements that fuel the film. “As a filmmaker, you're looking for gaps in cinematic culture, things that haven't been done before. And what I saw is that all of this great mythological cinematic work that I had grown up with — Ray Harryhausen movies and other things — I'd never seen that done with the sort of weight and credibility that an A-budget and a big Hollywood, IMAX production could do.”

And, yes, you can already buy tickets for it right now.

Universal will release “The Odyssey” in theaters everywhere on July 17, 2026. Watch the new trailer below.

The “Avatar” franchise is beloved for several reasons, from its incredible action to its pioneering use of 3D special effects. But if there's a main appeal to James Cameron's mega blockbuster series, it's stepping into the world of Pandora and the culture of the Na'vi, which is brought to life in part by production design. And while the series takes place in the future, production designer Dylan Cole explained why the attention to detail required him to approach the project like a period piece.

Ahead of the release of “Fire and Ash,” the third entry in the “Avatar” franchise, Procter and fellow production designer Dylan Cole sat down with IndieWire's Jim Hemphill, along with several other production designers from films such as “Hedda,” “The Testament of Ann Lee,” “Train Dreams,” “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” “One Battle After Another,” and “Sentimental Value.” The two discussed their work on the popular blockbuster franchise and on the highly anticipated new installment in Cameron's series.

“Imagine having to do like a 1920s Paris film, but you don't know what Art Nouveau looks like,” Dylan Cole said in the roundtable interview. “So first you need to design Art Nouveau, come up with that broad range, then pick which of those elements you want to put in your film. That's kind of what we're doing with all the different Navi cultures. There's a common misconception that in science fiction, ‘it's easy, you just make it up.' If we design something too alien or too unrecognizable or are designers just go nuts, then it's either distracting or you can't relate to it. So it needs to find that middle ground where it is aspirational and interesting but it it is still relatable, where we can engage with the story.”

 










According to Cole, the challenge of making an “Avatar” film comes from bringing to life the Na'vi cultures of the world of Pandora, which are both connected and decidedly different from each other. He likened the experience of production designing with that in mind to making a historical film in which you need to invent the entire context and aesthetic of the period the film is inhabiting.

There are movies that you love in part because of the memories you hold of them, from childhood favorites that are practically imprinted in your brain to blockbusters improved by a particularly amazing screening. Less talked about is the opposite: films you hate because they're attached in some way to a moment or experience you want to forget. 

Tim Burton's “Alice in Wonderland” is a horrible movie, yes, but I probably would not feel as strongly repulsed by it had I not first seen it in theaters with a 110-degree fever and spent the last 20 minutes puking my guts out in the bathroom.

 










But no film looms over this writer's life as largely as “Cast Away,” Robert Zemeckis' survival drama about Tom Hanks getting stranded on a deserted island, which I also never actually watched the whole way through until well into adulthood. If you don't understand why, take a second to scroll up a little and read that byline. 

Related Stories ‘The Americas' Narrator Tom Hanks Would Trade ‘Dad' Nickname for ‘The Best Park Ranger They've Ever Heard' Mia Threapleton Struggled  to Focus on ‘The Phoenician Scheme' Opposite Tom Hanks: ‘It's Bloody Woody‘ 

You can probably understand where we're going here.

 










I was born in 1999, a year before “Cast Away” hit theaters on December 22, 2000. In a “Sliding Doors” moment I think about quite often, my parents had two names they were still debating upon my birth: the very conventional George and the somewhat less-so Wilson. Family legend (or perhaps Mom and Dad trying to shift some blame) has it that it was one of the neonatal nurses who convinced them to go with Wilson.

The name itself, according to a phone call with my mother I took while writing this essay, came indirectly from her family tree: it was the name of a friend and business partner of my great-great-grandfather (or maybe great-great-great? We don't really remember), one my grandmother suggested. Notably, though, it wasn't his first name; it was his last.

“Wilson” is a very common last name in general; it was the tenth most popular last name in the U.S. during the year 2000. It's considerably more rare first name, however, apparently ranking around the 500s in given names during the '90s and since sliding down to the 600s in the 2000s onward. 

Growing up, I never met anyone who shared it as a given name, and there were a scant few places where I saw it used by a public figure or a character in film and TV. By my recollection, there was:

And then, of course, there's the Wilson of “Cast Away,” arguably the most famous person (give or take your definition of a person) to bear the name. 

The box office hit follows Hanks' FedEx systems analyst Chuck (famously, they show a lot of the company's branding in the movie), who is the only survivor of a plane crash that lands him on a remote island in the Pacific Ocean. He has no way of contacting the outside world, and only a handful of (FedEx!) packages to help him survive. 

 










One of these packages contains a brand-new volleyball, who Chuck names Wilson after the Wilson Sporting Goods company. Hanks decorates the ball with a smeared bloody red handprint to give him a friend of sorts on the island, and uses him to conveniently talk through his thoughts for the audience's sake.

I first became aware of “Cast Away” when I was around 7 years old, at the Maine house of family friends my parents took me to visit one summer. On their living room TV, I sat through a random 30 minutes or so before I changed the channel to Cartoon Network because “Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew” was playing. 

I do remember vaguely thinking it was funny and cool that the volleyball shared my name, and I did witness The Scene. You already know the one. The climactic moment in which Chuck takes a raft out to sea to try and escape the island, only for Wilson the volleyball to fall off his vessel and float away, leaving a heartbroken Chuck to bellow, at the top of his lungs, “Willllsooooooooon!” in a cadence that is both extremely memorable and extremely imitable.

Apparently, 7 years old is the prime age to introduce your kids to “Cast Away,” because that following school year was also when I started to become aware of my classmates — and some adults who thought it was fun to tease an elementary schooler — greeting me with their best Hanks' impression. As a kid, it's pretty customary to get your name mocked on the playground at least once in your life, but as far as names with Anglo-Saxon origins go, few had as easy or obvious a punchline as Wilson did in the mid-2000s.

 










The first time I heard it, I probably thought it was funny: the tenth and twentith and two-hundreth time? Not so much. 

Getting the “Willllsoooooon” yell at me in the hallway of school, at summer camp, when I was introducing myself to new people, became a constant I always had to expect and prepare for. It also, annoyingly, did not stop after fifth grade or even eighth grade, continuing through high school and well into college. As I got older, I also had to field genuine questions from people about whether my parents named me after Chuck's volleyball, who I began to regard as my mortal enemy.

As you can imagine, people using your name as a punchline, no matter how benign or harmless, isn't exactly a positive experience for an admittedly thin-skinned and insecure child/teen to deal with. It made me hate the name to the point where I went through an angsty, overdramatic phase during which I considered changing it. I tried occasionally to make a nickname stick, but people always told me “your name is perfect for you,” presumably because I was the only person with the first name that they had actually met.

If anyone were to ask pretentious teenage me in high school, I would have told them that “Cast Away” is one of the worst films ever made, an overly sentimental and vacuous bore that deserved none of the $429 million it made at the box office. Yes, I was basing this off of 30 minutes I half-remembered seeing during my childhood, but I had a grudge against this film, Robert Zemeckis, and sort of Tom Hanks (“Toy Story” and “That Thing You Do!” were enough to elevate him to thin ice), and was too stubborn to ever budge against it.

 










Of course, once you get to real adulthood, yelling “Willlllsoooooooon” at someone you just met becomes significantly less socially acceptable, and slowly the references trickled to a crawl. They never completely stopped, and choosing to go into writing about movies for a living did not exactly help, but it became an occasional annoyance instead of a constant. 

About two years ago, on a random weekday evening, I decided to take a step that I had refused for years. I was going to actually sit down and watch the film people had associated my name with for my entire life. I typically go into every movie trying to keep an open mind, but I did not have pure intentions here: the stubborn part of me wanted it to be bad. I wanted to hate it. And I wanted to watch that scene where Hanks wails over losing a volleyball in the water and think that it was cheap, dumb, and embarrassing.

Instead, like many people who watch “Cast Away,” I cried. 

 










Actually, really watching Zemeckis' film, I found a movie that's a lot more raw and stripped-down than I was expecting from him (not to denigrate the man who gave us “Who Framed Roger Rabbit”), with little of the sentimentality that sometimes overburdens his productions. The opening is slow and the ending is a bit of groaner, but the bulk of the film that's simply Chuck trying to survive on the island is riveting, methodical stuff, pure competence porn, as you watch him slowly but surely adapt to living in the wild and improve his techniques until he's finally able to escape.

The Wilson of it all initially registered as a false note while watching, but eventually I appreciated what it added, both as a reflection of how Chuck is slowly going stir-crazy alone on the island and as a clever way to provide a film with mostly just one character the vague shape of a two-hander. And Hanks gives maybe his greatest performance ever, a committed turn that fully lets you buy into the isolation and desperate circumstances and creates genuine pathos between him and his inanimate friend.

So when the “Willllsoooon” moment hit, despite having heard that moment quoted back to me more times than I can ever possibly count, I found myself surprisingly moved by it. On paper, it's a ridiculous scene: the reason why it's so famous is arguably that it's so silly for a grown man to mourn the “death” of a volleyball. And yet, in the context of the movie, it doesn't feel like it at all — between the stirring Alan Silvestri score that plays and Hanks' performance, which goes all out in depicting his sadness at losing Wilson as real, deeply devastating grief, the scene manages to transcend any sense of silliness to be fully emotionally enveloping. 

Watching it made me vaguely annoyed that a film scene so good could be reduced to just a cheap joke my whole life.

 










Did “Cast Away” become my favorite movie? Absolutely not, but with some distance from my childhood — and some recognition of the importance of having a sense of humor about yourself — I've learned to appreciate the film. And while having my name turn into a movie reference the year after I was born may not have been exactly ideal, I can choose to look on the bright side: my name is one people have always immediately remembered. 

I have Tom Hanks and a very special volleyball to thank for that.

December 22, 2025

Of the next-gen rap auteurs that characterize MIKE's 10k label—El Cousteau, Sideshow, and Anysia Kym, to name a few—Niontay has his finger on the wildest and weirdest pulses. Since crashing into the scene with the bold-faced statement “Real hiphop,” the posse cut where he put Earl Sweatshirt and MIKE in some of their most audacious environments yet, Niontay has kept his trailblazer reputation up with projects like Dontay's Inferno and Fada<3of$. His movements around the country—he was born in Milwaukee, raised in Central Florida, and now lives in Brooklyn—inform his geographically blurred sound. Chipmunk flows and equally chirpy beats bridge the gap between the Florida fast movement, Detroit cloud rap, and the hazier elements of New York's young alternative scenes. With the help of 454, who hosts the tape via his Gatorface alter ego, Niontay lets the contrast between these disparate ideas and sounds ring loud on Soulja Hate Repellant.

The mixtape doesn't veer away from Niontay's established sounds, but it does probe their deepest and murkiest corners. Niontay's style—his slurring, nasal voice that sometimes renders bars indecipherable—appears faster, blurrier, and more piercing. The beats are from a likeminded set of new-age underground producers like Surf Gang's Harrison, young Raleigh-based hotshot Dylvinchi, and wild cards like Jay Critch collaborator Laron. “Rockoutcentury” quickly establishes the tape's central idea with some quiet 808s and nostalgic synth pads that don't vary much, but the tracks on Soulja Hate Repellant don't stick around long enough to fatigue.

This lane can be surprisingly wide. The immense jump from “100days100nights,” a smatter of excited drums and synth patches that make for a perfect pregame soundtrack, to “3am@Tony's,” a lethargic swamp of blown-out low-end, feels like a vivid look into Niontay's hyperactive mind. This is a road where nothing stays in the same lane for too long. Wild swings—the baffling squeals on “soulja hate/ Mr.Havemyway x Mr.Beatdaroad” or the surprisingly fitting samples of the titular guitarist on “Mark William Lewis Flow”—are logical byproducts of the meeting of two minds as unrestrained as 454 and Niontay.

The tape's pivotal moment comes early, when Earl Sweatshirt appears, drenched in more Auto-Tune than ever before, on “Cressidaway!/ TPGeeK.” The beat, produced by New York alternative touchstone Tony Seltzer, is little more than a rumbling bass tone and some loose hi-hats, restrained even by the tape's standards. Niontay's bars blur into one another, veering toward the point of unintelligibility. At one point, he goes feral and devolves into some beautiful Auto-Tuned growling before moving into a much more quickly paced latter half. Earl Sweatshirt isn't a total stranger to this terrain, but he's rarely sounded this lethargic, as if he were doing a downbeat impression of 56 Nights-era Future. The performance might baffle anyone still clinging onto hope that Earl is the next coming of Nas, but it's a testament to the longtime experimentalist's unwavering interest in rap's most current and fringe corners. It's also evidence that Niontay and his generation of oddball upstarts have lessons to offer the old guard.

Soulja Hate Repellant feels like the most instinctual and reflexive version of Niontay yet. Though 454 takes on a DJ Drama-esque role, rather than directly producing any material, the underground guru's guidance can be heard throughout the record, especially in moments like the Florida fast tribute on “Dadecountydates.” Compared to his process on projects like Dontay's Inferno, where Niontay needed encouragement from MIKE to settle on the sound, Soulja Hate Repellant sees Niontay working confidently in his own skin, whether that means the Miami bass simulation of “Neymar” or the absurd 8-bit jerk beat on solidarity anthem “Free Luigi.” Niontay's bars are equally loose, largely built on Wayne-esque mixtape shit-talking, though it veers into paranoid territory on lines like “Sleep anxiety, geeked outside my body when I wrote this song.” The grab-bag vibe can make the tape feel too loose, especially for anyone unfamiliar with Niontay's freakout flows. But it's fascinating to hear the rapper taking potshots from half-court with conviction. It's even more surprising how many shots make it in.

From industrial dancehall to leftfield techno to deep, alienating drone made with saxophones, Kevin Richard Martin welcomes the spirit of dub into everything he touches. Across three decades, the physical force of his music has expanded and contracted, but two things remain constant: the pulse of dub, no matter how reduced, and the rumble of the bass. “[The goal] was to make a new form of dub music that I wasn't hearing,” he said of 2024's Machine, his previous collection as the Bug featuring intentionally scuzzy instrumental music. “I wanted to make dub music that maybe some people definitely wouldn't like.” The same motive could apply to Implosion, a collaborative album with Stuttgart artist Michael Fiedler, aka Ghost Dubs, that feels like a soundclash in the underworld.

Structured in a versus format with each artist trading blows, the album has a tension that makes its otherwise stone-faced music thrilling. If Machine was intended to make audiences physically uncomfortable, Martin's tracks on Implosion use the same sonic devices for more introspective ends. Each of his contributions is named after a venue or nightclub, and these desolate tracks can feel like they're reverberating through long-abandoned, decaying spaces. The music is lumbering, even by his standards, with basslines so belligerent they might trigger the lunk alarm. They're also stop-you-in-your tracks heavy, like “Believers (Imperial Gardens, Camberwell),” named for a long-gone '90s club. Here, ancient-sounding dub sirens and skanking basslines are fashioned into crude objects, the physicality making up for the billowing ambience.

Other tracks channel the mournful energy of the most political '70s dub. “Burial Skank (Mass, Brixton)” is downcast and paranoid, looking around the corner upon returning to reality after a blissed-out night. “Spectres (Plastic People, Shoreditch)” captures the sensation of the air physically vibrating in front of you. It makes me think of how Plastic People's sound system made dancers' teeth shake inside their heads at London's formative dubstep parties.

Such glacially paced music might have made for a challenging album on its own, but Fiedler's tracks hum with energy and the potential to explode, kinetic where Martin's are immovable. They saunter like slo-mo dub techno, with melodic elements that remind me of the slushy, re-re-sampled sound of early vaporwave. The textures are burnished but vague: Is that a snare drum? Is that someone pounding on a metal beam with a sledgehammer? Is that a voice? It's all gloriously unclear.

Fiedler taps into a different vein of dub: the one discovered by Basic Channel, where the eternal rhythm becomes a launchpad for sleek techno that sounds that hurtles toward outer space. On “Hope,” which plays spatial tricks across the stereo field, it sounds like we're listening to some arcane machinery sputter to life, all rusty gears and rickety joints (imagine if steampunk was actually cool). And “Midnight” wades through liquid mercury muck, almost weightless, as if it were made from sci-fi alloy that couldn't exist in the real world. Alternating between Martin's doom drone and Fiedler's abstract dub techno, Implosion brings out the best in each artist by highlighting their differences: Martin's music comes off heavier than ever, while Fiedler's fidgety rhythms are all the more dynamic. Martin has always been an expert collaborator, sculpting his beats around the voices he wants to work with. But here the connection is different: It's like he's hardened himself for battle with a worthy adversary.

	Last December after Luigi Mangione was arrested for the murder of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson, headlines from publications like CBS, People, and Newsweek shouted that his own mother had implicated him in the crime. Fox News ran the story with the headline, “Luigi Mangione's mom made shocking admission to police.” 


	The headlines came after NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny held a press conference a week after Mangione's arrest in which he said Kathleen Mangione told law enforcement the crime “might be something that she could see him doing.”


	However, there hasn't been any evidence Mangione's mother ever said this to law enforcement. 


	Mangione's lead defense attorney Karen Friedman Agnifilo brought the comments up last week on the final day of his suppression hearings in New York City. She asked either the New York Police Department, the San Francisco police department, or the Manhattan district attorney's office to “correct this very prejudicial statement that was never said.” (Mangione has pleaded not guilty to all state and federal charges against him.)

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The SFPD, who had conversations with Mangione's mother when she filed a missing person's request for him in November 2024, has so far stayed quiet about these comments attributed to her. But on Friday, Rolling Stone spoke with a San Francisco police officer to clarify their conversations with the Mangione family.


	San Francisco Sergeant Michael Horan was the detective who first identified Mangione as the prime suspect in the United Healthcare shooting. Horan was looking through Mangione's social media photos while investigating a missing person's case filed by Mangione's mother, Kathleen, who lives in Maryland. In November 2024, she filed the report in San Francisco, because she'd lost touch with her son earlier in the year and thought his employer was headquartered in the city. On Dec. 5, Horan was going through Mangione's case file when he was struck by how much the young man looked like the crime photos that were circulating by the NYPD. (He detailed this surprising discovery in a conversation with Rolling Stone last spring.)

	In an interview with Rolling Stone on Friday, Horan says he and his colleagues never spoke with Mangione's mother at all after he identified Mangione as resembling the UHC shooter. When specifically asked if he knew anything about Kathleen saying that to police at all, Horan adds, “That was never from us.”


	“After we made the connection between our case and the New York case, we never spoke with the mother again,” Horan says. “I do believe that the FBI spoke with the mother that weekend while they were trying to confirm, so that might have been a conversation that they had with her.”


	Horan says the only Mangione family member the SFPD spoke with once Horan raised his suspicions was one of Mangione's sisters, and they did not mention during that conversation anything about the crime photos that were circulating. “We were just kind of curious if she would have volunteered it, since [the crime photos were] all over the news, but it just never came up,” Horan says. 


	It's unclear where NYPD Chief of Detectives Kenny received this information that Kathleen supposedly said she could see her son “doing something like that.” (The NYPD did not respond to requests for comment.) 


	During his 2024 press conference,  Kenny also said, “Part of that vetting process was that they reached out to Mangione's mother in San Francisco, very late on the seventh. They had a conversation where she didn't indicate that it was her son in the photograph, but she said it might be something that she could see him doing.”

	Kenny mentions law enforcement reached out to Kathleen late on Saturday Dec. 7, 2024 in San Francisco, but Mangione's mother lives in Maryland, not California. He is also unclear if the “they” he is referring to is SFPD, FBI, or NYPD. 


	Kenny added that the information they'd gathered would be passed along to detectives “the next morning” — which would have been Dec. 8 — but Mangione was apprehended before they could act on it. However, Mangione wasn't arrested until Monday, Dec. 9, 2024. Kenny also said there are NYPD officers embedded with the FBI, but NYPD Detective David Leonardi testified last week that he hadn't even heard of Luigi Mangione's name until the Altoona arrest, days after the FBI received the tip and began vetting it.


	Horan reiterated to Rolling Stone that he doesn't know the specific details of Kathleen Mangione's conversation with the FBI over that December 2024 weekend. The SFPD's interactions with Kathleen in November of that year were purely about her search for her son. “She was just a concerned mother that just really wanted to find her son,” Horan said back in the spring. He said Kathleen had called the SFPD repeatedly to ask for updates on the missing person's case.

	In court, Friedman Agnifilo said that Kathleen had told the SFPD that her son was not a risk to himself or others, and Horan clarified this was not a conversation that happened after the Thompson crime. Instead, it was likely a conversation the SFPD had with Mangione's mother when she first filed the missing person's report on Nov. 18. Horan explains that asking someone if a person is a risk to themselves or others is standard operating procedure when filing a missing person's report.


	After Mangione was apprehended on Monday, Dec. 9, Horan remembers speaking once again with Special Agent Gary Cobb, the FBI agent he'd given the tip to on Thursday the 5th. Cobb told him, “Good job,” remembers Horan. That's also when Cobb told Horan they'd spoken to Mangione's family over the weekend, before he was detained.

Matt Damon‘s Odysseus sets out on a tumultuous journey home in the first trailer for Christopher Nolan‘s highly-anticipated next film, The Odyssey.


	The clip opens in the aftermath of the Trojan War. “After years of war, no one could stand before my men and home,” Damon intones over shots of soldiers. There are brief glimpses of Anne Hathaway‘s Penelope, Odysseus' wife, and Tom Holland, who plays their son Telemachus. The trailer hints at the difficulties that await Odysseus as he travels across the sea, including the cyclops Polyphemus and terrifyingly rough weather.


The Odyssey, an adaptation of Homer's famed Greek epic, was directed by Nolan, and stars Damon, Holland, Hathaway, Robert Pattinson, Lupita Nyong'o, Zendaya, and Charlize Theron. It is set to arrive in theaters on July 17, 2026. 


	“There's a bit of everything in it,” Nolan recently told Empire of his desire to adapt the lengthy tale. “I mean, it truly contains all stories. As a filmmaker, you're looking for gaps in cinematic culture, things that haven't been done before. And what I saw is that all of this great mythological cinematic work that I had grown up with – Ray Harryhausen movies and other things – I'd never seen that done with the sort of weight and credibility that an A-budget and a big Hollywood, IMAX production could do.”

	Nolan also revealed that he and his crew shot over two million feet of film over 91 days, with much of the production done on the open ocean. “It's vast and terrifying and wonderful and benevolent, as the conditions shift,” he noted. “We really wanted to capture how hard those journeys would have been for people. And the leap of faith that was being made in an unmapped, uncharted world.”

	Recently, Nolan released the six-minute prologue for The Odyssey in select IMAX theaters ahead of screenings of Sinners, One Battle After Another, and James Cameron's Avatar: Fire and Ash. According to Variety, the prologue includes footages of the famous Trojan Horse landing in Troy and Odysseus' leading his army to victory.

I
t's Fête Médiévale time in this tiny, sweltering southern French backwater, not far from where Robert Louis Stevenson and his donkey Modestine made their famous trek in the Cévennes mountains nearly 150 years ago. Today, the village is awash with women dressed in 15th-century woolen tunics, men in pseudo-Robin Hood gear. They're roasting whole pigs on spits, fake minstrels are serenading the crowd with remodeled ancient lutes, jester-jugglers with peaked caps are tossing animal bones in the air, macho knights are jousting. And just at the margins of all these festivities, on the terrace of a local bistro, his battered American straw boater blocking the sun from his eyes, drawing random sketches on the placemats (which sharp-eyed patrons will collect and sell for good money later on the art market), sits — in his own words — “a nerd with thick glasses” fixed in his own private time-warp: Robert Crumb, 1960s rebel comics-artist icon and a somewhat reluctant local resident for over 30 years now.

	











	It is a baffling backdrop for someone once at the center of the American avant-garde in California, his provocative posters everywhere to be seen in the Haight-Ashbury of the Sixties; his ubiquitous “Keep On Truckin'” cartoon co-opted onto T-shirts and burned into tattoos; an early swallower and proponent of LSD (good and bad trips). The progenitor of indelible characters such as the crackpot guru Mr. Natural, neurotic everyman Flakey Foont, horny feline Fritz the Cat, and zaftig temptress Devil Girl, among others, his own tortured family life was the subject of a critically acclaimed documentary (1994's Crumb). There's even a Star Wars figure based on him, the Kowakian monkey-lizard called Salacious B. Crumb.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Most lastingly, Crumb, 82, is still considered the godfather of personal-story (his own) underground comics that emerged from the counterculture era. Starting with his Zap Comix series, first published in 1968, Crumb moved out of the notion of the cartoonist-entertainer and instead created comics as open, uncensored self-expression. While inventing his many other characters, he also planted his own antihero persona in his work, usually in self-derogatory fashion. And this inspired a later wave of personalized comic writing, culminating in Art Spiegelman's Maus, as well as many of the autobiographical graphic novels that flood the market today.


	Crumb's rising fame was not without controversy. His personal drawings were often sexually explicit, if not brazenly pornographic, earning him public condemnation as a misogynist. Then, in the 1990s came the purposefully outrageous “When the Goddamn Jews Take Over America!” or “When the [N-—rs] Take Over America!” — savage tongue-in-cheek satires that appeared in his Weirdo comics and brought him powerful negative feedback. He also knowingly played with racist stereotypes in his character Angelfood McSpade, an oversexed African American woman one would have seen in chauvinistic cartoons out of the 1920s. Crumb defended the work as criticism of those stereotypes, presuming that people familiar with his art would get the point. Many didn't.


	My own relationship with Crumb began in the 1990s, when he was press-ganged into moving to these French boondocks by his second wife, the cartoonist Aline Kominsky-Crumb. A fellow American expat, I was introduced to the couple by mutual friends. There followed several years when our kids grew up together, spent Christmases together, and we all faced our alien status together. In 1993, Crumb and I collaborated on a book variously known as Kafka for Beginners, Introducing Kafka, or just plain Kafka, which has since been translated into about 20 languages. We worked on it intensively for a year, with him suggesting changes to my text and me amendments to his drawings. This cemented our friendship (although it's practically impossible to get emotionally close to him) and brought about mutual respect.

	When my partner, the Polish artist and radio producer Malgorzata Żerwe, and I visited Crumb in the spring, I hadn't seen him for several years, in large part for reasons of personal geography. We had come explicitly to record him for a proposed new audio feature, to talk about aging without being ageist or condescending — after all, he and I were born in the same year. A new authorized biography was due out (Crumb: A Cartoonist's Life by Dan Nadel, released in April), and we were hoping to find him in a reflective mood.

	For five hours, we walked the medieval pathways of the village, where the Vidourle River winds its ancient curve before plunging into the Mediterranean at the resort town Le Grau-du-Roi. Our conversation similarly wandered, covering his sexual appetites, his friendship with Janis Joplin, his mistakes of the past, his new preoccupation with conspiracy theories, his (surprisingly sympathetic) feelings about RFK Jr. and Marjorie Taylor Greene. Outdoors, for some reason, you become even more aware of Crumb's high-pitched, nervous laugh, which clings onto nearly every utterance, whether humorous or bleak. When we asked how it feels to be in the winter of his life, his reply was as unvarnished and self-aware as his cartoons.


	“It feels old. Like, half of my friends are dead. You know, my companions, old guys I hung out with. All the girls I knew that are now old ladies. And I'm completely out of touch with what the kids are into and all the electronic devices and all that stuff. I just feel like when I was a kid where you'd meet some old person, and they'd say, ‘Yeah, well, I'm from the horse and buggy days.' That's kind of what I feel like, you know, from the horse and buggy days.”THE ROAD FROM HAIGHT-ASHBURY to the foothills of the Cévennes is not merely geographically long, but also a historical and cultural time machine for Crumb. We're standing on the terrace of his ancient stone house in the Occitanie region, with its pervasive Roman ruins, looking at the river below, and noting that the entire village was originally built as a fortress. When I was living here in the 1980s, someone rebuilding an old house pulled down a false ceiling, and a gaggle of skeletons came crashing to the ground. These were found to be Huguenots hiding from Catholic persecution, cemented in for their own safety during the religious wars of the early 18th century.


	Crumb has not exactly adapted to these surroundings. Over 32 years in this village, he has not learned to speak French. And yet, he has no intention of leaving.

	











	“I'm kind of passive that way, I guess,” he says. “I'm not going anywhere. I'm going to die here. This is it. Die here with all my junk in this big house.”


	The “big house” could well serve as the movie set for a gothic horror fantasy. On three floors, with precariously creaky staircases, it's somberly dark, as classic Midi stone houses are supposed to be for keeping out the sunlight. Crumb has lived alone here since the death of Aline, his partner of 50 years, in 2022. Except that she is still everywhere to be seen and met on every floor, in every winding hallway and side corner. On the walls are what she referred to as her “shrines,” baroque objects filled with plastic dolls, saints, miniature figurines, animals, and plastic flowers, all overwhelmed with a shower of pearls, as well as her own collages depicting herself. Nothing has been touched or displaced since her disappearance, and Crumb refuses to clear her away. Her ghost touches him at every step of the way up to the top of the vast edifice.


	All those years together, it was Aline who principally dealt with daily life, with the infuriating French bureaucracy, with taxes, with registering their daughter, Sophie, at the local school, while Crumb sat in his dark studio drawing Self-Loathing Comics or Sex Obsessions or his bestselling take on the Old Testament. Most important, especially out here in the sticks, she could speak the language. This is not Paris, where you can bump into someone who might speak something resembling English; in this corner of France, Crumb needs a translator.


	“The organization of the wording is so different from the logic of English,” he says, explaining his befuddlement. “In English, you know, you're the subject. Then there's a verb, then there's the object. And that makes sense. ‘I want to go to the store.' The store is the thing you want to go to. You don't say it like that in French; you say, ‘I the store to go want' or something. It's completely some other logic that I just can't get past.” 


	Malgorzata and I spot a thick book in French on the dinner table, coupled with a French-English dictionary. It turns out to be the obscure autobiography of an obscure musician from the Auvergne region who started an obscure record company in the 1920s. Classical Crumb terrain. A musician himself (chiefly banjo), he loves to draw portraits of bygone musical artists nobody's ever heard of, whether they be from the American Deep South or la France profonde. The book itself is covered, line by line, with penciled-in translations that come from his constantly looking up the meaning of nearly every word. We ask how long has it taken him to read this book.


	“Fifteen years.”

	











	Added to Crumb's geographical isolation is his refusal to own a computer, to have access to the internet, or to use a cell phone. There is a television on the top floor of the house, but he doesn't know how it works. He craves the simple station-changing dial of the old days, and is somewhat terrorized by the very idea of a remote control. In a concession to modernity, he does email people, in a manner of speaking: He writes out messages by hand, in pencil (the old-fashioned kind with detachable erasers, which he mail-orders from the U.S.), then gives them to his secretary, Maggie, to type and send. When he receives a response, she prints it out for him to read.


	“The pencil is a great invention,” Crumb says, holding one up. “Beautiful. Look at that. You don't need a machine. You get this thing; you have a pencil sharpener you can carry around with you. Yeah, very fine invention. I hope they don't stop making them.”


	TODAY, I'VE BROUGHT MY COPY of Cheap Thrills, the Big Brother and the Holding Company vinyl from 1968, for Crumb to sign. He shot to prominence designing its famous cover on 24 hours' notice in a Methedrine-induced frenzy.


	The original cover disappeared — in fact, was kept and sold clandestinely by a CBS executive for around $25,000 and later re-sold by Anonymous for over $250,000. It's beyond imagination what it would sell for on today's high-end R. Crumb market. He has often been exploited in this way and always counted on Aline to set things straight. 


	Crumb says he agreed to the job chiefly because he needed the money at the time. (Yet when Mick Jagger tried to hire him for a Stones album, he refused. “I didn't like him.” Simple as that.) He was also seduced to the gig because of Big Brother band member Janis Joplin, whose singing he admired, and who later became a friend. In the early Sixties, in Texas, he'd heard some private tapes of her, made before she mutated into a rock & roll artist.


	“She was singing like Bessie Smith, old-time blues, and it was great. And later I saw some old films of her from the early Sixties, singing with a country bluegrass-type band, and she was like a hillbilly shouter. That's what came naturally to her. Then she got involved in rock & roll, and she really got lost. Got lost.” 

	











	Later, in the Haight-Ashbury, they linked up. “She liked the underground comics,” Crumb says. “She would come and hang out and smoke pot and stuff.” 


	Crumb, at the time, would be dressed unremarkably casually, in banal pants and sweater, with thick glasses, looking more or less like a geek. And, essentially, terrified of women. Janis attempted to intervene. 


	“She gave me advice to say, ‘Crumb, you know, there's all these beautiful girls out there. Come on. What's your problem? Just let your hair grow long. Get these billowy satin shirts and some bell-bottoms. You'll do fine.' I said, ‘I don't fit in with those hippies.' I couldn't do that. I would feel like a clown if I did that. I'd feel like I was faking it completely.”


	While conservative in his fashion tastes, Crumb is fanatical about music. He sits and listens to 78 rpm records every day. His treasured collection, gathered over decades, personally packed and transported across the Atlantic, now numbers 9,000 discs. Each single one, individually, methodically, lovingly placed in its own cardboard sleeve after meticulous washing with liquid soap and a toothbrush to get all the dust out of the grooves. Which can have unforeseen consequences.


	“I got a Louis Armstrong record from an auction, with his name written in white ink on the label. He autographed it. Autographed by Louis! There's his signature on there. So I was going to wash it because it was dirty, and the autograph completely washed off. But who cares? It's the music that counts.”


	And just what is the advantage of listening to 78 records?


	“The strongest presence of any recorded technology. There's a lot going on in those grooves. If you transfer to any other technology, CD or whatever, the presence is not as strong.” 


	“OK,” he concedes, “they're cumbersome, they're fragile. They take up a lot of room. They're heavy.” But: “There's the ritual that every time you want to hear something, you got to go and fetch it. Put it on the machine, put the needle on it. When it's over, you got to get up. Take it off, put it away. Get another one out. And that focuses your attention on what you're listening to. Before 78s, if you wanted to hear music, you had to hear it live.”

	











	As a devout collector, he also admires these objects as artifacts in themselves. (“There's ancient objects from the Egyptian tombs made out of shellac or coated with shellac, and they're still perfectly intact,” he marvels.) And he won't tolerate the idea of remastering those old discs.


	“There's two or three things they're trying to do. One is, they're trying to eliminate all surface noise as much as possible. The other thing is to keep the range in order — that is, the bass, treble, and mid-range — as they should sound, because with modern equipment, the stuff's so sensitive that you can lose the warmth of the old recording quality. It gets too high-endy sounding and it can become shrill. Modern recording engineers don't have the ear tuned to the old sound. They've got a different ear.”  


	WHEN I GOT MY CONTRACT for the Kafka book, I thought it would be tough bringing the legendary Crumb on board. But it turns out he felt a “mystical” connection to the writer.


	“Kafka was a very alienated person,” he says. “Like me. Sort of passive, kinda shy, obviously neurotic about sex and women and all that. A part of Kafka that I felt a soulmate with, it's that aspect of alienation and self-loathing … At some point he compares himself to a worm.” 


	This fusion went so far that, for his conception of Kafka's short story “A Hunger Artist,” Crumb drew the skinny self-starving, self-abusing circus performer with his own (younger) face. But it's probably Kafka's famous human-transformed-overnight-into-insect from The Metamorphosis, which mostly appealed to the weirdo drawingboard of R. Crumb.


	“For me, the bug was not particularly horrifying,” he says, “although people are repulsed by this giant insect. But he's not a menacing insect. He doesn't want to hurt anybody. So then, to me, he becomes almost a lovable bug. So I made him a kind of big, fat beetle. It's a very Jewish self-hatred kind of humor. Which you find in Lenny Bruce and other types of Jewish humor, where they paint themselves as something really repulsive. That all comes out of alienation. The pain of alienation. You can turn it into humor, but it's a dark humor.”


	It was definitely an existential love affair. 


	“Someone has reached out and touched you from the grave,” as he puts it. “Kafka's been dead since 1924. That you can feel so close with someone who's been dead for a couple generations back. Before you were born. And touch something universal, this alienation — that there's something loathsome about you, and it's a social thing. Part of you knows that you're not loathsome, but part of you feels loathsome in relation to society, to other people.“

	











	What basically links them is this strong streak of self-denigration. Self-loathing for Robert Crumb is definitely intertwined with his ambiguous (to understate!) lifelong take on women. He has been vilified for his notorious drawings of oversized women with ample rumps and thick, powerful legs, definitely objectified and more or less turned into meat-at-the-ready. (One of the most famous of these is his irreverent Clinton-era poster Monica Delivers the Pizza, with its derisive caption, “That Bill's a lucky guy!”) He rides on the backs of his big women figures, contorts their bodies, distends their thighs into pliable shapes. Yet what makes Crumb unique in this world of crypto-porno is his own ferocious self-deprecation in the shadows of these Amazonian figures. The subtitle of his tome Sex Obsessions is Absurd Hi-Jinx With Big Beautiful Girls ‘n' Creepy Little Guys. And sure enough, the “creepy little guys” are often gnome-sized self-portraits, clinging like ugly trolls to the vast architecture of female limbs, terrified and sweating guiltily. And sometimes ending in mea culpa like the 1988 cartoon Memories Are Made of This. After pages of gross sexual abuse, the klutzy Crumb lookalike hero states, “I know I'm cutting my own throat as far as th' opposite sex is concerned …. They'll despise me now…. I'll never get laid again!”


	It's quite obvious that this all comes from a deep measure of physical insecurity, clearly what Janis Joplin spotted in his comportment. His early dread of contact with women drove his fantasies, and, luckily, he was able to channel this into drawing rather than something more physically dangerous. According to Crumb, women took virtually no notice of him or avoided him like the plague until around 1968. Then suddenly fame intervened.


	“When Zap Comix came out and I started getting recognized, all of a sudden I became interesting to girls. Before that, I was tongue-tied in front of any woman that I was attracted to. I couldn't talk, couldn't speak. After I was famous, I didn't have to say anything. Wow. Suddenly, night and day. The difference? Just fame in this little, cockamamie hippie culture. It wasn't, you know, international movie-star fame. It was petty fame.” 


	Malgorzata is meeting him for the first time, and her X-chromosome vibrations easily win the day with the old bearded geezer. She asks him if he ever wrote love letters.


	“I wrote love letters to my first wife when I was young. And she sold them! I wrote to the auction house in Texas that bought them and I said, ‘Please just let me have those love letters back, please.' And so they said, ‘OK, we'll sell them to you.' I said, ‘Fuck you, fucking mercenary bastards!' It was mushy stuff. I didn't want those out there, but somebody bought them.”

	











	With Malgorzata recording every word on our riverside trek, inevitably the subject comes up: How does this veteran of the sex wars look at all of that now?  


	“I was ruled by my dick. I cringe with embarrassment to think of the foolish behavior, the nonsense. Oh my God, chasing women. What a bad boy I was. I was bad, selfish, selfish, selfish, selfish. You know, I was lying to this one and running to another one and, you know, lying to that one and running back to the other one. Oh, terrible, terrible. What on Earth did I think I was doing? I was just ruled by the libido, you know, just couldn't help myself… But, you know, my whole thing with women was always very odd and quirky and strange. Always, always.” 


	Which brings us to Marjorie Taylor Greene. Politically, Crumb has no doubts about who she is: “The most low-level, sleazy, opportunistic politics of playing on the ignorance of her constituency, which is some remote mountain county of Georgia.”


	Nevertheless…


	“I saw her on TV, where she was talking. I thought, ‘Oh, she's kind of good-looking.' And she's athletic. She goes to the gym, and she's just looking terrific. Wow. So a kind of tough-looking blonde, you know? A shiksa from the South. Wow. I started getting the hots for her. Wow. And I thought I could change Marjorie Taylor Greene. I could, you know, if I was involved, I could raise her consciousness and convert her to something more like an ethical state of mind and become a better person as well as, you know, having a good time with her.”


	I thought for a moment, on hearing this astonishing news, that we might be lucky enough to expect a new Reactionary Girl comic starring MTG following in the sleazy footsteps of Lenore Goldberg: Girl Commando, Honeybunch Kaminski, Devil Girl, and the other Crumb Amazons.


	“I thought about that, but I don't want to get in trouble,” he says. “Who knows what kind of nasty shit she'd be capable of? Who knows? Nasty. She's nasty. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Great-looking, though. Boy, what a body! Wow. Tough. Tough body.”

	











	CRUMB IS SURPRISINGLY au fait with the tempestuous political events of the last few years, despite his resistance to electronic input. Still, from all indications in our recent discussions, I can see he's moved close to the danger zone of right-wing propaganda and conspiracy theory. This is a personal dilemma for me, never having lost an ounce of my lifelong political combat against the reactionary steamroller. Crumb and I have often been at odds politically. I remember, many years back, his giving ear to a moronic Holocaust-denier who had turned up on his doorstep (although RC later renounced this). He can be annoyingly gullible sometimes. Yet, in his favor, he seems to harbor a healthy natural skepticism that has often manifested itself in his artwork and which gnaws at him in his seclusion. Having virtually no one to argue with, he finds himself in natural dialogue with his own private, darker side, one that questions almost everything. On Ukraine:


	“Everybody's always talking about what a terrible guy Putin is. He's a terrible monster like Hitler. Na da da da da. But I'm not sure the Americans are much better. So what do we know about what's really going on? We just hear the Western propaganda — United States, Western Europe. And it has its program, its agenda, its interests. What do we really know?”


	Crumb is also not vaccinated. He says he would have voted for RFK Jr. if the latter hadn't gone over to Trump. Moreover, he powerfully backs the health secretary's “medical” views.


	“They're not legally required to test vaccines the way they do other medicines,” Crumb says. “It's a commercial enterprise for money. And as Kennedy points out, why does anybody trust Pfizer or any other large pharmaceutical company when they've repeatedly been indicted and convicted of fraud and had to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in fines? Why do you think they'd be clean about vaccination? So just to be critical or even open to suspicion of hanky-panky or shenanigans around vaccination is immediately shut down by The New York Times or anybody. That's very suspicious. Something's not right about that.”


	I can't accuse him yet of having gone over to the enemy, but I'm compelled to point out to him that he's flirting with positions taken by reactionaries. In response, he strongly defends his stand from what he sees as a common anti-authoritarian viewpoint.


	“It's nice to hear, to some degree, mistrust of anything coming from ‘authoritative' sources, coming from the government, coming from the so-called liberal intellectual elite. I have friends who are still part of that liberal elite who don't question anything that comes from what they think [are] authoritative science sources. To question it means you're a crazy, right-wing nut. The problem with people on the right is that their thinking is just sloppy. They don't develop deep powers of discrimination. That or their paranoia is just out of control. You know, they're just so paranoid that their imagination can take them anywhere immediately.”  


	Yet he sees himself as integrated into that landscape. In his studio, on the drawing-board, is his latest brew of “paranoia” comics, published in November 2025, amounting to page after page of raw ranting — predominantly text — by the central self-portrait figure, all of it hand-lettered in Crumb's inimitable all-caps block script:

	











	“LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE NOW HARBOR SUSPICIONS THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING PHONY OR RIGGED ABOUT THE WHOLE PANDEMIC NARRATIVE …. THANKS TO THE ‘PLANDEMIC' THERE IS NOW A SEVERELY PARANOID BELIEF GOING AROUND THAT THE EVIL CABAL WHICH RULES THE PLANET IS SCHEMING TO KILL OFF SOME UNSPECIFIED NUMBER OF THE ‘USELESS EATERS'! …. I HOPE IT'S NOT TRUE!”


	All of this ending in a bold black 72-point spot-on exhortation to “QUESTION AUTHORITY.” And it's the old geezer Crumb himself doling out these “lessons” which have to be taken with a grain of comic relief to avoid taking them as potential nutcase fodder.


	So, for a famous partaker of the Sixties' let's-redo-the-planet mentality, where did it all get us?


	“Oh, oh, oh. Very dangerous moment. It doesn't look too good, because these dictators, they betray the trust of the common people. And that leads to bitterness, anger, confusion, violence, and could lead to large-scale organized violence. I hope things go in a positive direction because, you know, I have grandchildren.”Being so cut off from the “sidetrackings” of city life, stuck within these dreary fortress walls, which, in winter, can seem like stage sets for a dark depression drama, there's plenty of time for cogitation. Crumb acknowledges he's “deeply, deeply immersed in conspiracies,” and struggling to find the humor in our current troubled times. A sign, perhaps, that the end is near?DESPITE BEING A ‘TOTAL FOREIGNER,' Crumb is content to spend his final days in his adopted homeland rather than return to America. “This medieval village suits my sensibilities just fine,” he says. “You know, a thing of beauty is a joy forever.” And ironically, since the passing of Aline, he manages to live like a sultan here, despite his isolation. His daughter Sophie helps to look after him, alongside a cadre of local caretakers.


	“I'm very lucky. I got this big support group of women. I don't have to cook for myself that often. They cook, they help me. Like Maggie helps me sort out my business stuff and the tax stuff and all that crap. And Julie takes me shopping. I got Rekha, who helps me clean the house, who lives right next door. It's a funny thing, wow, when you get to be an old man, women run the world. When you're young, men are out there messing everything up, always constantly causing turbulence and bullshit going on all the time.”


	In this chastened state, Crumb is acutely aware of his mortality, and facing it with more clarity each day.“Yeah, I'm ready for the box,” he tells us. “I'm ready to be put in a box, so to speak. You know, I'm not as creatively hot as I was in the old days. I don't know how much longer I'll be around. Who knows? Could drop dead tomorrow, have a stroke or something. You know, if I stand up too quickly and I feel woozy, I think maybe this is it, huh?”

	











	This is when Malgorzata asks him if he believes in “life after life.” Knowing him as well as I do after 30 years, his response takes me by surprise.

This story is published in partnership with The Trace, a nonprofit newsroom covering gun violence. Subscribe to its newsletters.


	Between 1990 and 2021, the gun industry flooded the American market with at least 717 million detachable firearm magazines that hold 11 or more rounds of ammunition, according to a study produced by the gun industry's trade group, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, and obtained by The Trace and Rolling Stone.


	A magazine stores ammunition and feeds it into a gun's chamber, allowing a person to continuously fire bullets without reloading. The larger the magazine, the more a person can shoot without interruption. In mass shootings, this makes it harder for people to escape, linking the device to high casualty counts.


	Not all manufacturers of gun magazines provided data to the NSSF, the study stipulates, so its figures represent a “conservative estimate.” In addition, “Military and law enforcement sales were not counted.” The study, begun in 2023, says that roughly 46 percent of the magazines it accounted for — some 443 million — were rifle magazines that held 30 rounds or more.

	From 1994 to 2004, large capacity magazines — magazines holding 11 or more rounds — were prohibited under the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. Still, according to an NSSF spreadsheet that underpins the study, and was obtained through a public records request, production and distribution of these magazines, also known as LCMs, continued. This was due, at least in part, to loopholes and exemptions. During the ban, hundreds of thousands of pistol LCMs were produced and entered the market each year, as were millions of rifle magazines that held 30 rounds or more. 

	











	In a 2024 deposition, the NSSF's research director, Salam Fatohi, was asked by an attorney if he was surprised that, at a time when LCMs were illegal, manufacturers had produced such a large number in the 30-plus category. He answered, “I can only report what is provided to us in this estimate and through the survey data. That's it.” He also said, of the manufacturers, “If they are truthful in their reporting — they give that to me — I trust their information because they have a vested interest in being open and honest with us.”

	Since the ban's lapse, the gun industry has sought to normalize LCMs, pumping huge numbers of them into the civilian market. The spreadsheet shows that production and distribution of magazines holding 30 or more rounds skyrocketed starting in 2010, reaching 23 million — almost tripling the previous year's number.


	Over the last two decades, with no ban in place, mass shootings have become a familiar aspect of American life, and LCMs have become strongly associated with them. On Saturday, December 13, after a gunman opened fire at Brown University, killing two people and injuring nine others, police recovered 44 spent shell casings and two LCMs, according to an arrest affidavit. Each device was capable of holding roughly 30 rounds. 


	Rhode Island, where Brown is located, has a ban on LCMs, but the restriction is dwarfed by the reality that the devices are available in most states. An examination of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban by criminologist Christopher Koper found its effects to be muddled because of the various loopholes and exemptions. But, he wrote, the “ban's most important provision was arguably its prohibition on ammunition magazines holding more than 10 rounds.”


	The NSSF's study, titled the Detachable Magazine Report, and the spreadsheet provide an insider's view into the breadth of the industry's effort to use LCMs, in particular those holding more than 30 rounds, to turn a profit. Production and distribution largely continued to jump each year after 2010, peaking in 2018, the year of the Parkland mass shooting, at 37.4 million.

	The Trace and Rolling Stone obtained the documents for a series called “The Secret Files of the Gun Industry,” which uses a trove of records to reveal the industry's inner workings.


	The NSSF declined to provide a comment for this story. In a policy document posted on its website, the organization asserts, “Any capacity-based ban on the manufacture and sale of magazines would be utterly arbitrary.” It adds that a prohibition would “infringe upon the Second Amendment rights of Americans by having the government limit their ability to defend themselves, their loved ones and their property.”

	The NSSF's claim, according to research by economist Lucy Allen, lacks empirical support. For litigation, she and a team analyzed 736 incidents, between January 2011 and May 2017, in which the National Rifle Association documented a person using a firearm for self-defense. The NRA had compiled these events for its Armed Citizen database, which, according to Allen, was the “largest collection of accounts of citizen self-defense compiled by others that I am able to find.” Her analysis found that the people in the database fired 2.2 shots on average, and out of the 736 total incidents, only two involved a person reportedly firing more than 10 bullets.


	Allen also documented and examined 161 mass shootings that took place between 1982 and 2019. For 105 of them, the shooter's magazine capacity was known. Of those, 63 — or 60 percent — involved LCMs. “In particular,” Allen noted, “we found an average number of fatalities or injuries of 27 per mass shooting with a large-capacity magazine versus 9 for those without.” Allen added that of the 63 incidents involving LCMs, there were 43 in which the number of shots fired could be determined. “Shooters fired more than 10 rounds in 40 of the 43 incidents,” she wrote, “and the average number of shots fired was 103.”

	Matthew Duckworth Kirksey, drummer for the Flaming Lips, addressed the departure of long-time band member Steven Drozd over the weekend, claiming the group's live show is now “better than ever.”


	Last week, Drozd appeared to reveal he's no longer part of the band group a tenure of more than 30 years. Drozd let the news slip on Threads after he posted about a new drum machine. In the replies, someone asked Drozd — who hasn't performed with the Flaming Lips since last year — if he was “officially done” with the band. 


	“They're done with me — but we're not talking about it,” Drozd replied in the now-deleted post. “So yes, I'm moving on.”


	After speculation about the status of the band began to circulate, Duckworth Kirksey responded in a post on Instagram. 


	“Man… hard to read a lot of these comments,” wrote Duckworth Kirksey, who has been part of the band since 2014. “Being in a band, for a long time, that never really stops touring is hard. Some people can hack it for 5 years, some people can hack it for 25 years.” He added that “a lot of great friends” have “come and gone” throughout his time with the band. “I still love them, and miss them, and some of them are my family,” he wrote.

	The drummer continued, “If you haven't heard this newest iteration of the band, give us a shot. The music, and the show is better than ever.” 


	Duckworth Kirksey also addressed claims that Drozd was the creative soul of the group, rather than frontman Wayne Coyne. “And remember…NONE of this ever happens without Wayne,” he wrote. “This idea that Steven was THE musical genius, and Wayne is just some weirdo artist…It's just not true. Wayne pushes the creativity, the sound, and the show forward, like no artist I've ever been around.”

	











	He added that while being part of the Flaming Lips is “hard,” it's “Wayne's drive to be great that makes it all possible. Always has, always will.”


	The drummer concluded, “There is new music on the way and I think it's the best thing we've done in ages. I can't wait for you to hear it. Come see us this summer if you get a chance.”

When the Lips returned to the road in January 2025, they were joined by guitarist A.J. Slaughter, who's performed with the group throughout the year.

A person living in New York state claims they witnessed a series of strange objects in the early morning sky. The person described the objects as being different than stars, and were said to have been bright gold and yellow in color.

The latest sightings are similar to other recent eye witness accounts.

A report filed to the National Unidentified Flying Object Reporting Center on November 25 had stated that a resident of East Nassau was driving on the Massachusetts Turnpike. The driver states that they were heading towards the New York State Thruway when they saw an object above the road with ""bright lights"".

New York State Resident Witnesses Strange Orbs In the Sky

The witness from Lockport, New York, in Niagara County, said the latest encounter occurred early in the morning, December 11. The report filed to the National Unidentified Flying Object Reporting Center says that the person went outside, around 4 AM, when they saw the lights in the sky.

The witness says they ""turned to step on my back deck"", when they noticed ""two strange lights almost slowly falling in the eastern sky"". The report goes on to say as the first two lights ""slowly disappeared behind houses on the horizon, three more lights appeared where the previous ones started up high"".

The account says there was no way to tell how far or high in the sky the objects were.

The witness says they retrieved their binoculars, and when they peered through, there were multiple other orbs moving around the more visible lights, much to their surprise.

The man who filed the report claims these were not satellites, because ""they would change directions"", as the resident counted at least twelve of them. The report says the objects moved around the horizon, in every direction.

The witness also says that they don't believe they're drones. The resident claimed they ""observed these orbs since November 19th same time 4am four other times up to last night Dec 11th"".

Baba Vanga alien prediction: Are aliens and UFOs real? The Blind Bulgarian mystic is said to have predicted the first official contact with otherworldly beings in 2026. This comes amid reports that Trump has been briefed about UFOs being real.

Blind Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga predicted contact with a new alien civilisation in 2026, according to her followers. Her prophecies are not written down anywhere, and her niece, Krasimira Stoyanova, and some of her other followers documented her visions after her death. However, experts have cautioned that her predictions, which reportedly started after she lost her eyesight at the age of 12, have no proof and should be taken with a pinch of salt. One of her predictions for the new year is now going viral, as she is believed to have seen a ""large spacecraft"" arrive on Earth in November 2026. This will be the first official contact between humans and extraterrestrial beings, according to the prophecy.

Baba Vanga was said to have made a similar prediction for November 2025 as well, according to which aliens would reach Earth and make contact during a major sporting event. While some people tried linking it to 3I/ATLAS, the interstellar comet in the solar system, nothing of the sort happened. But now, the same prophecy has returned for the year 2026, and many believe it could turn true. A few days ago, Polymarket, the world's largest prediction market, said that there was a 12 per cent chance that alien existence could be ""officially acknowledged"" in 2025. There have been reports that US President Donald Trump has been briefed about aliens and UFOs, and officials would declassify previously classified UFO/UAP files before the end of this year.

According to platform data, odds soared from single digits to the mid-70s on December 7 within hours, and even touched 81 per cent at one point in time. The bet will be resolved only if previously classified documents, videos or reports relating to UFOs are released, and no vague leaks will be considered. Despite this, more than $233,000 reportedly ended up in the contract at share prices of around 76 to 77 cents.

The year 2025 was filled with talks about aliens and UFOs, especially after 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July. Some scientists even claimed, citing its trajectory and timing, that it could be an ""alien mothership"" coming to ""seed out planet"" with ""tiny probes."" But, NASA, ESA and several other astronomers dismissed all such claims, saying that it was a comet.

Some of the other prophecies made by Baba Vanga for 2026 include a global war that could spiral from the current tensions. She is also believed to have seen the fall of the West and the rise of Vladimir Putin as a world leader. More natural disasters, such as earthquakes and floods, could ravage the world in 2026, according to her believers who think she foresaw them in her visions.

The unusual specimen raised eyebrows because it appeared capable of causing levitation. An official investigation has not settled the matter, some UFO enthusiasts say.

Here's what you'll learn in this story:

As Earthlings, we're curious about whether alien civilizations like ours are out there, or if they exist at all. That's why scientists were intrigued when a mysterious shard of metal found on Earth exhibited signs that it might have come from intelligent minds on a distant planet.  

This peculiar specimen fell  to Earth around 1947 in the supposed UFO wreck. It seemed linked to the infamous Roswell incident, in which members of the general public believed was a flying saucer had crashed to Earth. However, the debris found in Roswell actually turned out to be from a U.S. Air Force balloon meant to spy on Soviet nuclear experiments. 

The true origins of the metallic specimen, were debated for decades. The sample had an apparently unprecedented material structure that could indicate an extraterrestrial technosignature, or sign of alien technology. 

Eventually, Blink-182 frontman and UFO enthusiast Tom DeLonge's To the Stars Academy, an organization that independently researches possible alien phenomena, got a hold of it. Then, the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which investigates unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) for the U.S. government, took over the investigation. It was seeking to learn of any physical and chemical properties that made the object potentially capable of inertial mass reduction—levitation.

It turned out that the object was a magnesium alloy whose main components are magnesium and zinc. It also contains bismuth, lead, and other trace elements. 

AARO asked Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to conduct an analysis in 2022 because scientists were especially interested in whether the sample was of terrestrial origin and if its bismuth content meant it could have possibly been used by aliens as a terahertz waveguide, a metal object that directs electromagnetic waves emitted by an energy source. ORNL was originally established during WWII to investigate things such as atomic weapons, and most of what its scientists investigate is still energy-related. However, the lab has also studied materials suspected to be extraterrestrial. 

This metal shard specimen “purportedly exhibits extraordinary properties,” according to AARO and ORNL's recently published findings on the object.

ORNL scientists looked for evidence of life beyond our planet by studying the sample for possible biosignatures, which are naturally occurring substances associated with life, and technosignatures, which are signs of extraterrestrial technology that scientists seek out especially when searching for intelligent life. 

Some UAPs might have both.

In looking for alien biosignatures, ORNL scientists wanted to see whether the metals in this alloy were from Earth. That meant investigating their isotopic signatures, which represent the ratios of different element isotopes—different atomic mass versions of the same element.

Analysis showed that the isotopic signatures of magnesium and lead indicated a terrestrial origin. The magnesium's isotopic signature had undergone some separation of lighter and heavier isotopes, probably due to stress from heat and physical or chemical manufacturing processes. However, it was still within the normal range for magnesium that forms on Earth—not an alien biosignature.

The magnesium in this sample also showed a proportion of isotopes that occurs only in our solar system, strengthening the case for a local origin. Scientists know this because the isotopic signature of magnesium originally comes from a particular star-forming region and so is unique to each star system. Magnesium is an extremely common element in the universe, produced in great amounts by larger, older stars that scatter it into space when they die and go supernova. It is often recycled by young star systems, where it forms a unique isotopic signature, depending on the conditions. 

The lead in the object also matched the isotopic signatures for lead that originates on Earth. These signatures are so distinct that there is no way they could have come from any other body—even the moon. 

With no alien biosignatures present in the sample, the ORNL scientists turned their attention to technosignatures. Scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed that the crystalline structure of the magnesium was similar to the magnesium in alloys manufactured on Earth. With that confirmed, they tried to determine if the sample could have been part of a terahertz waveguide.

Waveguides are metal objects that transmit electromagnetic waves. For example, the magnetron in your microwave oven transmits waves to the main oven cavity, where they heat up leftovers. A terahertz waveguide levels up this technology with much more intense terahertz waves, hypothetically enough to levitate an object if built using the right methods and materials. 

“Based on the technologies developed by humans, waveguides can only channel radiation for purposes of communication, data collection, or heating but the conjecture for the UAP was that they were used for levitation,” says Harvard University theoretical physicist Avi Loeb, PhD, who was not involved in the study. “That would represent a technology unknown to humans.”

To qualify as a piece of alien technology, the sample would need to have a single layer of pure bismuth between layers of the magnesium alloy. This is because unadulterated bismuth can guide energy just like the magnetron in your microwave. Unlike anything in your microwave, bismuth is capable of directing terahertz waves. The problem is that the bismuth in this sample is neither pure nor in a single layer. There are multiple layers of bismuth between the magnesium layers, and the bismuth itself contains lead, both of which would disrupt its functioning as a waveguide.

“ORNL has a high level of confidence that all data indicate the material was manufactured terrestrially—albeit using an uncommon mixture of elements by today's standards—and then incurred damage caused by mechanical and heat stressors,” according to the report.

After seeing the analysis, To the Stars released a statement on its website, anticipating a meeting between its own scientists and the ORNL team. In particular, To the Stars is hoping to learn more because “the reports do not offer a firm conclusion as to the origin and purpose of the material along with other seeming anomalies. [To the Stars] has more questions about both reports.” 

While we still don't know exactly where on Earth the mysterious sample came from, all indications show that it belongs to our own planet. There is a likely origin story behind this object—it might be a product of post-WWII magnesium alloy research for lighter and stronger aircraft. Back then, magnesium alloys were poorly understood, according to the report.

Maybe this artifact wasn't part of a larger piece of technology manufactured by alien hands, or whatever appendages and machines they might use. Still, this was a valuable exercise, because ruling out objects that originated on Earth only gives us a better idea of what could be truly extraterrestrial.

What would you sacrifice to ease someone's unbearable suffering? Clinical psychologist and author P.A. Farrell answers this question in THE MEMORY KEEPER SERIES, a four-book paranormal suspense collection now available through Amazon Select, Draft2Digital, ePub Library distribution, audiobook, and digital library services.

The series follows Riley Bennett, an ordinary man who becomes something extraordinary when he binds himself to a convergence point—a supernatural place where people can store memories too painful to carry. Riley gives up his human form, his freedom, and his ability to leave, transforming into a Memory Keeper who exists between worlds to protect his small Midwestern town's darkest secrets.

""I wanted to explore what it really costs to help people,"" says Farrell, who draws on her psychology background to create emotionally authentic characters facing impossible choices. ""Riley isn't a traditional hero. He's someone who sacrifices everything—his life, his humanity, his future—to ease other people's suffering. The series asks: Is that sacrifice worth it? And what happens when helping others means losing yourself?""

The complete series includes:

THE MEMORY KEEPER'S APPRENTICE (Book 1) - Riley's transformation from reluctant apprentice to bound keeper, facing his first test against entities that feed on fresh trauma.

THE STOLEN HOURS (Book 2) - A black-market memory trade threatens Millbrook when someone discovers how to steal memories for profit, forcing Riley to stop a rogue operation.

THE CHILD WHO FORGOT (Book 3) - Riley must extract fractured memories from four abused children while confronting Marcus Brennan, a failed keeper who weaponizes memory suppression to hide his crimes.

THE CONVERGENCE WAR (Book 4) - the first keeper created 7,000 years ago, attacks convergence points worldwide. Riley must unite isolated keepers in a desperate defense that will determine humanity's future.

Written at an accessible 12th-grade reading level, the series targets working-class readers who appreciate emotionally complex stories without academic language. Each novella delivers 10,000+ words of supernatural suspense grounded in human resilience and the psychology of trauma recovery.

""THE MEMORY KEEPER SERIES is about more than paranormal powers,"" Farrell explains. ""It's about the communities we build, the sacrifices we make for each other, and our capacity to heal even after unbearable suffering. Riley's journey proves that connection is stronger than isolation—and that sometimes, helping someone carry their burden is the most important work in the world.""

The series explores timely themes including:

• The ethics of memory and consent

• Trauma processing and healing

• Sacrifice versus self-preservation

• Isolation versus connection

• Human resilience in the face of suffering

All four books are available now through:

• Amazon Select (Kindle Unlimited eligible)

• Draft2Digital (wide distribution)

• ePub Library services

• Audiobook format

• Digital library distribution

For readers who enjoyed ""The Night Circus"" by Erin Morgenstern, ""The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue"" by V.E. Schwab, or ""Mexican Gothic"" by Silvia Moreno-Garcia, THE MEMORY KEEPER SERIES offers supernatural suspense with emotional depth and Midwestern charm.

As astronomers scour the universe for traces of alien life, one researcher has revealed exactly what first contact will look like.

However, that meeting won't look like the close encounters of a Hollywood blockbuster.

According to the 'Eschatian Hypothesis', the first extraterrestrial civilisation we encounter is likely to be in its final moments of total collapse.

This is because, just like dying stars and supernovae, civilisations are likely to burn their brightest just before they vanish into darkness.

According to Dr David Kipping, of Columbia University, this theory means the first aliens are likely to be 'unusually loud'.

In a YouTube video, Dr Kipping says: 'Hollywood has preconditioned us to expect one of two types of alien contact, either a hostile invasion force or a benevolent species bestowing wisdom to humanity.

'But the Eschatian hypothesis is neither.

'Here, first contact is with a civilisation in its death throes, one that is violently flailing before the end.'

A scientist has revealed what our first encounter with aliens will be like, and it won't look anything like what we have seen in movies like Close Encounters of the Third Kind (pictured)

In a new paper, due to appear in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Dr Kipping argues that finding aliens should follow the same rules as all other astronomical discoveries.

That means the first examples we discover are not typical of their class, but rather 'rare, extreme cases'.

To understand how this 'detection bias' works, imagine looking up at the night sky on a clear night.

Of the thousands of stars you can see, about a third will be giant, dying stars in the final stages of their lives.

This transitory period lasts less than 10 per cent of a star's lifetime, and only about one per cent of stars in the universe are in this giant phase.

However, since dying stars are so much brighter than their typical neighbours, they make up a huge proportion of the stars we can detect with the naked eye.

The same is even true of more extreme events such as supernovae - the vast explosions which occur when massive stars run out of fuel and collapse.

These explosions are staggeringly rare, with a Milky Way-sized galaxy only experiencing one every 50 years.

The supernovae from dying stars (pictured) are incredibly rare, but we see thousands every year because they are so bright. Scientists say that alien civilisations should be the same, in that we are more likely to find one burning brightly in its final moments - even if these are rarer 

For example, a nuclear war would produce a huge burst of energy that intelligent civilisations would be able to detect. Pictured: The Castle Union Nuclear Test, 1954

However, astronomers routinely discover thousands of supernovae every year, just because they are so incredibly bright.

According to Dr Kipping, there's no reason that our first discovery of alien life shouldn't follow the exact same rules.

He says: 'So, by extension, we should expect that the first detection of an alien civilisation to be someone who is being unusually loud.

'Their behaviour will probably be atypical, but their enormous volume makes them the most likely candidate for discovery.'

This means the first aliens we meet will be like a loud, obnoxious party guest - most people in the room don't act like that, but the ones that do get noticed by everyone.

However, when we consider what could cause a civilisation to become loud, the situation becomes a lot more bleak.

As civilisations become more advanced, they become more efficient - wasting less energy and using the energy they do have more sustainably.

Just like how a well-maintained modern house leaks less heat than an old, crumbling home, healthy civilisations shouldn't be giving off huge amounts of excess energy.

If humanity's first alien encounter is with a dying civilization, how should we respond?

This means our first encounter with aliens won't be a purposeful communication, like in the new film Disclosure Day. Instead, we are more likely to hear a civilisation's last desperate shouts 

In this sense, the volume of a civilisation is a sign of 'extreme disequilibrium' that heralds impending collapse.

For example, the intense heat and energy released by a nuclear war would cause a planet to light up in a way that sensitive telescopes could detect.

Likewise, some scientists have suggested that aliens could even use rapid human-caused climate change as a sign of intelligent life on our planet.

Some civilisations in total free-fall may even begin broadcasting signals into space in an attempt to reach other life.

Dr Kipping has suggested that the famous 'Wow! Signal', detected by scientists in 1977, could have been a civilisation broadcasting one last desperate shout.

Instead of doing deep studies of promising star systems or patiently waiting for a coherent message, Dr Kipping says scientists should frequently scan the entire sky.

Brief unexplained signals, sudden flashes, or systems undergoing rapid, anomalous changes could all be signs of a loud civilisation going through collapse.

So, while it might not be a cheering thought, this theory could help find our first signs of life out amongst the stars.

The Fermi Paradox questions why, given the estimated 200-400 billion stars and at least 100 billion planets in our galaxy, there have been no signs of alien life. 

The contradiction is named after its creator, Italian physicist Enrico Fermi.

He first posed the question back in 1950.

Fermi believed it was too extraordinary that a single extra-terrestrial signal or engineering project has yet to be detected in the universe — despite its immense vastness. 

Fermi concluded there must a barrier that limits the rise of intelligent, self-aware, technologically advanced space-colonising civilisations.

This barrier is sometimes referred to as the 'Great Filter'.

Italian physicist Enrico Fermi devised the so-called Fermi Paradox in the 1950s, which explores why there is no sign of alien life, despite the 100 billion planets in our galaxy

If the main obstacle preventing the colonisation of other planets is not in our past, then the barrier that will stop humanity's prospects of reaching other worlds must lie in our future, scientists have theorised.  

Professor Brian Cox believes the advances in science and engineering required by a civilisation to start conquering the stars will ultimately lead to its destruction.

He said: 'One solution to the Fermi Paradox is that it is not possible to run a world that has the power to destroy itself.

‘It may be that the growth of science and engineering inevitably outstrips the development of political expertise, leading to disaster.'

Other possible explanations for the Fermi Paradox include that intelligent alien species are out there, but lack the necessary technology to communicate with Earth.

Some believe that the distances between intelligent civilisations are too great to allow any kind of two-way communication.

If two worlds are separated by several thousand light years, it's possible that one or both civilisations would become extinct before a dialogue can be established. 

The so-called Zoo hypothesis claims intelligent alien life is out there, but deliberately avoids any contact with life on Earth to allow its natural evolution.

      'Masterclass' Netflix disaster film leaves fans 'ugly sobbing' - as it's compared to apocalyptic hits Interstellar and The Day After Tomorrow

When ET phones home, it could be his last call.

Contrary to sci-fi movie depictions, our first contact might not be with a super advanced alien civilization at the height of power. 

Rather, Ivy League astronomer Dr. David Kipping argues that we're more likely to meet “unusually loud” extraterrestrials whose empire is in decline.

“Hollywood has preconditioned us to expect one of two types of alien contact, either a hostile invasion force or a benevolent species bestowing wisdom to humanity,” the space expert, who hails from the UK but runs Columbia University's Cool Worlds Lab, postulated in a Youtube video.

He declared that more likely, our flagship close encounter “is with a civilization in its death throes, one that is violently flailing before the end” — like an intergalactic version of the late-stage Roman Empire.

Kipping outlined this bold theory, dubbed the Eschatian Hypothesis, in a new study slated to appear in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

In the paper, Kipping argued that our first contact would follow the same rules as other interstellar “detection firsts,” which constitute “rare, extreme cases with disproportionately large observational signatures.”

To illustrate his hypothesis, the Brit referenced supernovas, luminous explosions marking the death of a star. 

These “astoundingly rare” cosmic phenomena only occur twice per century in Milky Way-sized galaxies, but astronomers routinely detect thousands of supernovas each year due to their enormous “luminosities,” per the study.

In fact, most stars we see are in the twilight of their life. 

“One merely needs to look up at the night sky to note that approximately a third of the naked-eye stars are evolved giants, despite the fact less than one percent of stars are in such a state,” Kipping declared.

By this logic, he deduced that the “first signatures of extraterrestrial intelligence will too be highly atypical, ‘loud' examples of their broader class.”

But instead of a supernova, he argued, this extraterrestrial empire would be denoted by an event on par with “global nuclear war” — a similarly fleeting and cataclysmic phenomenon that represents the “brightest luminosity” we can achieve as humans.

Kipping concluded: “The ‘Eschatian Hypothesis' thus argues that humanity's first confirmed detection of another intelligence could be that of an inherently unstable, transitory, atypical but very loud example.”

The astronomer noted that this doesn't mean that any “loud” civilization we encounter will necessarily be one the decline. However, he explained that most observable “technosignatures” — climate change, pollution etc — do represent some departure from the status quo.

The theory comes amid a swirl of hypotheses surrounding 3I/ATLAS, the interstellar visitor that made its much-anticipated closest approach to Earth on Friday. 

While NASA has maintained that ATLAS is a comet, Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has speculated that it could be artificial due to the abundance of anomalies, ranging from its unusual trajectory through the solar system to its strange jets that he speculated could be technological thrusters.","{'href': 'https://nypost.com', 'title': 'nypost.com'}","other"

Synopsis: Sam and Dean find themselves in a small town in Massachusetts, where a group of live-action role players have recently survived a mysterious attack in the woods that left one of their members missing.

Determined to save their friend, the LARPers are heading back into the forest for a new adventure, but this time they'll be armed with real weapons — as well as the hard-won occult knowledge of the accompanying Winchester brothers!

The StoryWhen Sam and Dean run out of fuel due to a busted fuel tank on their Impala, they find themselves investigating a mysterious murder in a small town involving LARPers, a book club, and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. While attending the book club, the brothers are met with suspicion from its members, who do everything they can to put Sam and Dean off the trail.Undeterred, Sam and Dean follow the LARPers into the woods when they go after a figure they refer to as “The Wizard”, whom they believe killed Orville, the former leader of their book club. The Wizard unleashes several ghosts on the group, leaving the LARPers completely unequipped to defend themselves. Fortunately, Sam and Dean are prepared for the encounter and manage to see the spirits off before confronting The Wizard directly.With the mystery seemingly solved and the immediate threat dealt with, Sam and Dean attempt to leave town and continue their journey. However, just as things appear to be wrapped up, they discover that their Impala may now be possessed, suggesting the case isn't quite as closed as they thought.ArtworkEder Messias does a solid job with the artwork throughout this issue. My favourite sequence of panels is the scene in which Sam and Dean fight off a group of ghosts that appear in the form of human skeletons. This moment is especially effective and strongly recalls the classic scene featuring the skeleton warriors in Jason and the Argonauts.I also really enjoyed the final panels of the book, which show Sam and Dean gradually realising that neither of them is actually driving the car. It's a strong closing beat that adds an unsettling twist and reinforces the idea that the case may not be as neatly resolved as it first appears.OverallThis is a solid opening chapter to a story that will most likely be resolved in the new year. I love the idea of Dean's prized car being possessed and look forward to seeing how it all gets resolved next year.

A look at James Fox's expanded documentary on the 1996 Varginha UFO incident in ‘Moment of Contact: New Revelations of Alien Encounters.'

Table of Contents

Film: Moment of Contact: New Revelations of Alien EncountersDirector: James FoxRelease Date: December 22, 2025Platform: Digital (Amazon Prime, Plex, Roku)Runtime: Expanded Edition (approx. 120 mins)

The conversation around UAPs and non-human intelligence has shifted dramatically over the past few years. What once lived on fringe message boards now fills the halls of Congress. The documentary space exploring these topics has matured considerably, and James Fox is one of the directors leading that charge with meticulous, well-researched filmmaking.

Today, Fox releases Moment of Contact: New Revelations of Alien Encounters, an expanded and frankly impressive update to his 2022 film. This is not just a re-cut. This is a more complete portrait of one of the most intriguing cases in UFO history. If you thought the original documentary was compelling, this new edition brings forward testimony that deepens our understanding of what happened in Brazil in 1996.

For those who might be new to this specific case, let me set the stage. In January 1996, the city of Varginha in Brazil became the epicenter of one of the most credible UFO events on record. Unlike Roswell, which happened in a remote desert in 1947, Varginha was a bustling city. The incident involved dozens of witnesses, including civilians, fire department personnel, and military police.

The core story has always been chilling. Locals reported seeing a cigar-shaped craft in distress. Shortly after, reports emerged of strange creatures being captured by Brazilian authorities. We are talking about 4-foot-tall beings with brown, oily skin, large red eyes, and three protuberances on their heads.

Fox's original 2022 film did a masterful job of assembling the witnesses. We heard from the three young women who first saw one of the beings crouched by a wall. We heard from military whistleblowers who transported the entities. But there were always gaps in the narrative. There were always names we knew but who remained silent.

That changes with this new edition.

The centerpiece of New Revelations is the testimony of Dr. Italo Venturelli. For decades, rumors circulated that a neurosurgeon at the Regional Hospital in Varginha had not only seen one of the creatures but had interacted with it. In this new film, Dr. Venturelli finally comes forward.

Watching this distinguished medical professional describe his experience is deeply compelling. He recounts a four-minute face-to-face interaction with the entity. This was not a fleeting glimpse. He was in the room with it.

Venturelli describes the being in clinical detail, corroborating the descriptions given by the other witnesses. He mentions the reddish eyes, the small stature, and the oily skin. But what he adds to the narrative is the element of communication. He claims the being communicated with him telepathically.

He describes a feeling of immense telepathic pressure and a transfer of information that was not in Portuguese or any spoken language. And, he speaks about the being conveying a sense of sadness or pity for humanity. It is a moment in the film that stops you cold. You are watching a man of science, a neurosurgeon, struggle to articulate an experience that defies his entire worldview. It is raw, emotional, and incredibly persuasive testimony.

Fox and his team, including producer Marco Aurélio Leal, deserve credit for securing this interview. It anchors the film and provides the kind of high-level corroboration that builds credibility. This is not an anonymous source. This is the head neurosurgeon of the hospital where the events took place.

One of the smartest things Fox does in New Revelations is contextualize the Varginha incident within the broader conversation about UAPs happening in the U.S. Since the original film dropped in 2022, that conversation has shifted significantly. We have had the David Grusch hearings in Congress. We have had The Program, Fox's 2024 documentary exploring the Pentagon's aerospace programs and investigations.

This new edition weaves those threads together. Fox traveled to Washington D.C. to attend the hearings, and he uses that footage to show that Varginha is not an isolated oddity. It fits into a larger pattern of incidents being investigated by world governments.

The film features new commentary from Dr. Eric Davis, the astrophysicist and aerospace engineer who has briefed Congress on these matters. Davis brings a technical perspective to the case. His presence adds weight and helps bridge the gap between a small Brazilian city and the halls of the Pentagon.

We also get insights from Christopher Mellon, the former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence. Mellon has been a consistent voice in advocating for transparency around these phenomena. His inclusion in the film suggests that officials inside the U.S. government take the Varginha case seriously. The film explores the possibility that U.S. intelligence agencies were monitoring events as they unfolded.

From a filmmaking perspective, James Fox continues to refine his approach. New Revelations is well-structured, engaging, and free from the sensationalism that derails so many UFO documentaries. Fox respects his audience by presenting evidence and letting viewers draw their own conclusions.

The editing in this expanded version feels natural. The new interviews with Dr. Venturelli, former police chief Pedro Luiz Aguiar, and the medical professionals are integrated smoothly with the original material. You never feel like you are watching additional scenes tacked on to an old film. It flows as a cohesive investigation.

The sound design is also noteworthy. The interviews are crisp, and the score is understated, building intrigue without overshadowing the witnesses. Fox understands that the faces of these people, the sincerity visible in their words and expressions, are far more powerful than any dramatic musical cue could ever be.

Beyond the entities and the government involvement, what makes New Revelations so effective is its grounding in human experience. Fox has always been an empathetic filmmaker. He cares about the people in his stories.

The Varginha case had real consequences for those involved. Marco Chereze, the military policeman who captured one of the beings, died shortly after from a mysterious infection. His family continues seeking answers. The three girls—now adults—faced ridicule and skepticism for decades.

In this film, you witness their vindication. Dr. Venturelli's testimony supports their accounts. The police chief's recollections align with theirs. The scattered pieces are coming together, and you can sense what this means for these witnesses. They are no longer dismissed as unreliable. Their experience is being taken seriously.

The film also acknowledges the late Stanton Friedman, the nuclear physicist who championed research into cases like Varginha. Seeing his legacy honored feels appropriate, particularly as these investigations continue gaining mainstream attention.

We are in a time when conversations about UAPs are happening at the highest levels of government. Congressional hearings have normalized discussions that would have been mocked a decade ago. But sometimes, you need a focused investigation to make a case compelling. You need to understand the specific details of one event to grasp why officials take these matters seriously.

Moment of Contact: New Revelations of Alien Encounters provides a focused examination. It presents a fascinating case thoroughly, allowing viewers to understand why the Varginha incident remains significant more than 25 years later.

If you are skeptical of UFO narratives, this film challenges you to engage with the evidence presented. If you follow these topics closely, this is the most comprehensive look at Varginha ever produced for film.

James Fox has created a documentary that respects both the subject matter and the audience. It is not sensationalized. And, it is not making claims it cannot support. It is simply shining a light on a case that deserves serious consideration.

You can stream Moment of Contact: New Revelations of Alien Encounters starting today on Amazon Prime, Plex, and Roku. Whether you are a longtime believer or someone just getting curious about these topics, this film provides a solid entry point into one of history's most documented UFO incidents.

For those who want to understand the full context before watching, here is a refresher on the film's comprehensive timeline.

James Fox presents these elements as pieces of a larger puzzle. The documentary does not claim to have all the answers. Instead, it invites viewers to consider the evidence and think critically about what occurred in Varginha in 1996.

This is absolutely worth your time. New Revelations is a thoughtful, well-researched documentary that illuminates a case many people have never heard of. It makes a compelling case for why the Varginha incident deserves to be remembered and studied.

Updated on:  December 21, 2025 / 11:50 PM CST
            / CBS Chicago
          

Damion Martin lost his mother to a hit-and-run driver the week before Thanksgiving in 2024. More than a year later, the case remains suspended and the crime unsolved.

It had only been dark for about an hour-and-a-half. It was cold and spitting snow that night.

Tanja Safforld cut across a gas station lot, taking a shortcut to the store. She never made it across the busy South Side street.

At 5:56 p.m. on Nov. 20, a driver hit her and then fled the scene.

Almost immediately, 911 calls started coming in: ""Somebody got hit by a car,"" ""On Marquette and Western, they ran over somebody,"" ""I saw this car pass by and then it ran away, it didn't stop.""

Callers described the car, the driver, and where the car went after it hit Safforld. ""It turned going down east on Marquette.""

""She was a real nice lady, loving, very supportive, wanted the best for everybody,"" said one of her seven children, Damion Martin.

""Nobody can imagine your mother going to the store, getting things for Thanksgiving, and then just don't even return for the holidays. That's real hard,"" he said.

Body camera video CBS News Chicago received via a public records request revealed police officers arrived on the scene several minutes after the 911 calls. Chicago Fire was already there.

Police asked fire: ""She's going to live, though, right?"" Fire responded: ""As of now.""

An ambulance took Safforld to the hospital, but she was pronounced dead around midnight.

""This is the hardest thing of my life,"" said Martin, who is still coping with the pain of losing his mother and not having answers as to who's responsible.

Police on the scene the night of Safforld's death said one of the cameras nearby wasn't facing the right direction. The police report indicates that no witness statement was taken, and no detectives would be arriving on the scene. 

A Major Accident Investigation Unit (MAIU) officer was assigned to the case the next day.

It took another day for the investigator to go back to the 6700 block of Western and take photos. In all, he took 27 photos and looked for video from several businesses in the area, including the gas station and the dollar store. 

By the afternoon on November 22, Chicago Police issued a Community Alert with a photo of a dark-colored sedan, which police indicated may have been the car that hit Safforld.

Tips about that car came in, and police ultimately ruled that car out. 

Martin believes the first alert should never have gone out because 911 callers on the night of the hit-and-run described the car as a gray sedan, possibly a Hyundai.

In all, case files received via public records request reveal the MAIU Investigator spent 39 hours on the case in November, another 49 hours in December. In total, 130 hours by February 2025. But on March 2, 2025, the case was suspended.

Other records show Safforld's incident was one of 276,000 hit-and-run incidents on Chicago streets between January 2017 and July 2025. Three thousand and two hundred of them ended with serious injuries or loss of life. Fewer than 25% of those serious cases had been solved.

With the police investigation seemingly going nowhere, Martin went back to 67th and Western.

""I actually walked around this whole neighborhood,"" he said.

He was looking for cameras and clues, and posting his search on social media.                                                                                    

Supplemental police reports note a license plate reader was ""offline"" the night his mother was killed. The POD camera video that was reviewed had several glitches — often covering up traffic for long periods of time, in essence, making the video useless in identifying a vehicle.

""How was there no cameras active? And, and I see cameras everywhere. So I just went on TikTok for just the first time, and I had like 400 followers on TikTok. I started pointing out everything, video just went viral,"" said Martin.

And, piqued the interest of people with important information.

""The witness found me through TikTok.""

The witness, who did not want to be identified, connected with Martin and told him she saw the accident happen, ""I looked through my mirror, and I said to myself, 'Somebody is gonna hit her.' And as soon as I said it, I screamed because I see how the car hit her.""

Her story was different than the police description on the November 22 Community Alert. ""When I call the cops … they were saying that it was a black car, but I know it wasn't. It was a gray car, four-door gray car.""

Martin's social post piqued the interest of someone else with a new clue.

""A psychic wrote me out of nowhere and say, 'Go check a blue and yellow sign,"" he said.

Martin went back to the scene and found it. A car dealership with a blue and yellow sign. He was able to look at the business' surveillance video with the witness. She pointed out the gray car she saw hit his mother. 

It was now nearly a month after his mother's death.

Martin provided the new information to the MAIU investigator, and within a couple of days, on Dec. 20, police issued a new Community alert with the photo of the gray car. 

The car dealership is featured prominently in the investigator's photos taken on November 22. But, case file records show he never checked for video from the dealership until after the psychic's clue and the witness confirmation that Martin recorded.

""We would have been getting justice because maybe, maybe the guy that did it would have turned himself in. Now, by putting misleading information out there, now he probably thinking like, 'Oh, they don't know it was me. I can get rid of this car now,"" said Martin.

Why are hit-and-run cases so difficult to solve, and if solved, difficult to prosecute?

Professor Bennett Gershman of Pace Law School said, ""I keep coming back to how difficult it is to get enough evidence to prosecute effectively, and to convince a jury, especially where there may be the excuses … I didn't realize what I did, it was dark, I didn't hear anything, I didn't see anything.""

CPD declined to comment on the community alert issues and said the case remains open, but suspended. 

Police also declined to make anyone from MAIU available to talk about the challenges they face and whether they need more resources. 

A spokesperson said they're committed to getting justice for families.

Despite the car photo mix-up last year and the lack of movement on the case this year, Safforld's family still has hope that justice may come for their mother.

""We just wanna let everyone know that we're not giving up. We still have hope, and we're not going anywhere. We're gonna continue investigating until someone speaks up because someone heard something and they saw something,"" said Truly Holliday, Safforld's daughter.

Meanwhile, Martin maintains a memorial near the crash scene, and to mark one year since his mother's death, he and other family members released balloons in her honor. He says what he misses most about her is ""the support, the hugs, the kisses.""

This summer, the podcaster Candace Owens says, she had a pair of dreams about one of the most significant moments of 21st-century political history. The first dream came on September 1, and by morning the details were foggy: she remembered being swarmed by bees; the setting was, for reasons she didn't understand at the time, a school. When she woke up she was convinced that “something very dangerous” was about to happen, so much so that her husband joked she was going insane. Ten days later, Owens's friend and onetime colleague Charlie Kirk was murdered at a school in Utah, whose nickname is the Beehive State. Distraught over his death, Owens put her podcast on hiatus and, soon after, had a second dream. “Charlie was sitting in a chair, and I won't say where he was or where we were, but he said he was betrayed. And then I said, ‘By who?' Then the dream did that thing” — Owens started mumbling to me, as if underwater. “I saw one person who I recognized in that dream, who is at Turning Point. I woke up and I texted him immediately, and I said, ‘I just had a dream and Charlie told me you betrayed him.'” He never responded, she says, but so began her latest crusade.

“It's very weird. It's like the universe is shouting at me,” Owens told me one afternoon this November. “There've been moments in my life where something comes on and it's so overwhelming that I have to act.” She described them as her “That's So Raven moments,” the Spidey-sense inklings that have led her to publicly claim, among other things, that Charlie Kirk's murder is a cover-up; Kamala Harris isn't Black; Zionists and pedophiles control, well, everything; and the First Lady of France, Brigitte Macron, is a biological man — a conspiracy theory that has gained so much traction that the French president is currently suing Owens for defamation in the U.S. (Australia, meanwhile, recently denied her a visa, citing concerns she would “incite discord” in the country.) Conspiracy theories, Owens has said, are “mind yoga,” mental exercises that make you question “the narrative.” Owens is constantly talking about “the narrative.” By which she means: everything the government and mainstream media are telling us.

For safety reasons, Owens had requested we meet in the private dining room of a fusty steakhouse not far from her home in Nashville. She arrived in a Cadillac SUV with two bodyguards; one stayed in the car, and the other kept sentry at the exit, occasionally peeking into the restaurant to surveil all the diners. Owens wore a black turtleneck and jeans and carried her signature merch, a “Standace cup” that reads “CIA” (for Candace Intelligence Agency) on one side and “We Don't Know-Know But We Know” on the other.

Though we were there to discuss, in part, her friend's recent assassination, Owens was in a cheery mood. “You're a wizard, Harry!” she cracked at one point, still talking about her pseudo-psychic hunches. There was reason to celebrate. The day before, her podcast had become the most downloaded show in the U.S., ranking above shows hosted by Joe Rogan and Oprah Winfrey. Her viewership spiked dramatically after she started talking about Kirk's murder, which she does not believe was committed by the 22-year-old lone shooter Tyler Robinson. Her first show after Kirk's death, titled “They Are Lying About Charlie Kirk,” has been watched over 9 million times on YouTube. Owens's working theory of who actually did it is maddeningly convoluted, but at various points since September 10, she has accused Kash Patel, Donald Trump, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Mossad, the Macrons, and Turning Point itself of somehow participating in or hiding the truth about Kirk's death.

Over the past three months, Owens has fully devoted her life to this investigation, and it has alienated her from former allies. The night before we met, Megyn Kelly conducted a live interview with Owens's onetime colleague Ben Shapiro, who said she was faulting Kirk's widow, Erika, the newly installed CEO of Turning Point. (Owens had, at that time, never done so; lies often beget more lies.) Shapiro joined a growing chorus of right-wing influencers, activists, and commentators accusing Owens of opportunistically capitalizing, including financially, off Kirk's murder and also exaggerating the nature of their friendship. Still, Owens's reach is so large, her conviction so unshakable, that the whole news cycle soon torqued around her theories anyway. Robinson appeared in court early this December, but the eyes of the media and internet were trained not on the official investigation but instead on Owens's informal probe. Erika Kirk has repeatedly been asked to respond to Owens. “Stop. That's it. That's all I have to say. Stop,” she told Bari Weiss on CBS this month. Within the week, Kelly, who'd largely been defensive of Owens, brokered a meeting between the podcaster and the widow. (“The meeting was calm,” Owens later told me. “That's all I will say for now.”) It didn't seem to stop Owens; the next day, on her podcast, she kept talking about the “Egyptian planes” — what have, thanks to her, basically become this generation's grassy knoll.

Owens also spent the year burning bridges with President Donald Trump, the man who once called into Fox & Friends to describe her as “the hottest thing out there.” She says her displeasure with Trump stems primarily from his handling of the war in Gaza and the Epstein files. (“If I sense there's any sort of a cover-up regarding children being harmed, you're going to get the bull,” Owens told me.) Trump, in turn, has reportedly been unhappy with Owens's so-called transvestigation of Brigitte Macron. According to Owens, he called her in February to express his concern that she would jeopardize the White House's relationship with the Elysée. “I said, ‘Mr. President, respectfully, I told the truth,'” Owens told me. “The president said, ‘Well, she doesn't look like a man.'” She says it was the last time she spoke to Trump.

Now divorced from the two forces that made her most famous — Turning Point and Trump — Owens's reach is nevertheless the widest it's ever been, with 5.7 million subscribers on YouTube. In the conservative media ecosystem, she plays the role of the tea-spilling Real Housewife, and her willingness to frustrate her party, she thinks, has drawn a new wave of unexpected fans, allies, and reluctant reposters. This summer, the prominent progressive commentator Mehdi Hasan wrote online that he was surprised to find himself agreeing with Owens's critiques of Israel. Anecdotally, her conspiracies about Kirk's murder have even seeped into the brains of Zohran-voting Brooklyn lefties. “What has helped me in this grieving process is knowing that it helped people on both sides to actually meet and say: ‘There's a true evil manifesting, and we're stuck within this left-right paradigm, and I'm kind of thinking it's the government?'” Owens told me.

Fully unleashed, Owens gives the impression she is guided, more than anything else, by her gut. Her superpower, she says, is “reading people”; the source of her intel: “Not being born yesterday.” “I think by this time next year we're going to be having a very different discussion about what happened to Charlie Kirk,” Owens told me at the steakhouse, as confident as ever, still talking about the dreams she believes turned into a real-life nightmare. “Obviously, I wish we could go back and this thing never happened, but you do have to try and see the light.” The light, as Owens sees it, is that people are buying her narrative for once.

Most weekdays, Owens walks down to her basement to put out her show. She goes live shortly before dinnertime, which is, she says, when her audience of mothers are picking up their kids for school or prepping dinner. She moved to Tennessee in 2021 when she was hired to podcast for the Daily Wire. In her studio, the setup is always the same: Owens in full hair and makeup sitting behind a desk with her Standace cup and riffing, usually for an hour, about the topics of the day. There is no formula, she says, “just doing hood-rat stuff with my friends” — a small team that includes a producer, an editor, and her manager, Savanna, who is also sometimes her nanny (“Savanny”).

The way Owens always saw it, she and Kirk, who hired her in 2017 as Turning Point's communications director, served two distinct but complementary roles in the conservative movement. He was the boy wonder (her “overly bright and sometimes annoying kid brother,” she's called him) who could charm donors and swing votes; she was the social-media-savvy millennial whose guiding belief is that culture is upstream from politics. On her show, she has perfected that mix of culture-war politics and tabloid gossip that has turned many women with podcasts and newsletters into celebrities during Trump 2.0 (Jessica Reed Kraus, a.k.a. House Inhabit, once accused Owens of copying her while both were covering Justin Baldoni's feud with Blake Lively; Owens was recently subpoenaed by Lively's lawyers.) On Candace, she covers the Epstein files and the Diddy trial with equal intensity, with a smattering of parenting advice in between. Occasionally, she brings on special guests, including Harvey Weinstein, who dialed in from prison, and cancel-culture-critical celebrities such as Russell Brand and M.I.A.

As in her new book, an anti-feminist polemic called Make Him a Sandwich, she slips easily from blandly anti-woke cultural commentary (about such things as body positivity and Lena Dunham) to more blatant bigotry, usually on “transgenderism” or Judaism. Owens says there are no red lines she's unwilling to cross. “Just asking questions” is her M.O.

Like any reality-TV star, she knows how to keep listeners hooked by promising more drama, constantly saying that she is “getting close” or that “something is just stinkin' to high heaven!” One Monday in November, for instance, she posted on Instagram: “Today is going to be a big day … This is not an exaggeration.” Not much was revealed on the show that evening, but it was reason enough for the audience to tune in come Tuesday. Owen's sources often come from her own tipline, whose inbox has become so glutted that she's considering hiring a fifth employee to vet it. Occasionally, to provide a sheen of authority, Owens presents screenshots and graphics (like a list of “TPUSA Verified Lies”) for those watching at home.

Her self-confidence alone can make even the most inane details sound crucial to the case. One example: The fact that Brigitte Macron is often dressed by Louis Vuitton's Nicolas Ghesquière, who has sent gender-bending looks down the runway, is somehow proof of Macron's transness. In another YouTube series this year, Owens attempted to debunk details of Weinstein's sexual misconduct. She brought no new information to the table; for hours and hours she reread already public court transcripts, including his victims' testimonies. Still, her tone — mocking, skeptical, saucy — somehow made everything sound suspicious and freshly newsworthy.

Owens presents herself as a mama bear on a mission to create the world she wants for her four children, whom she shares with George Farmer, the former CEO of the now-defunct conservative social-media app Parler. She does not believe in the public-school system, so all of them are homeschooled. (Every lesson with Mrs. Owens begins with a “Hail Mary,” she tells me.) When I ask her how she'll teach her children about American history, she summons one of her favorite podcast catchphrases: “Everything is fake and gay 101.” But she says she will encourage them to read “both sides”: her book and Lena Dunham's.

America's youth, Owens clearly believes, is in danger — from the “trans agenda,” from pedophiles, from their left-wing elementary-school teachers. Now that she's a mother, she's especially convinced the culture is deeply pedophilic, like QAnon come to life. It's one of the reasons she became so interested in Brigitte Macron. As Owens's narrative goes: Because Brigitte famously met Emmanuel when she was his high-school teacher, she's a trans groomer.

Owens first heard about this conspiracy, which had been circulating among the French alt-right for years, from an article in the Daily Mail while at a UFC fight in Miami. She became so titillated that she didn't even pay attention to Jared or Ivanka, also in attendance. Months later, when the Macrons wanted to know why the conspiracy was gaining traction in the U.S., they approached Clare Locke, a high-profile law firm known for taking on the media for defamation and that notably helped win a settlement for Dominion Voting Systems against Fox in 2023. Clare Locke retained an investigative firm, which soon zeroed in on Owens's podcast as the source. In the month after releasing the first episode in February, Owens claimed her YouTube series “Becoming Brigitte” racked up 58.2 million views and 11.8 million hours of watch time and earned her nearly 500,000 new subscribers.

In December 2024, Clare Locke sent Owens a warning on the Macrons' behalf. Owens doubled down and soon after began to sell merch: a T-shirt with Brigitte Macron's face cropped onto a Time “Man of the Year” cover, which was for a time available to purchase at Walmart online. This July, in an extraordinary move for a foreign dignitary, the Macrons sued Owens. “This is not some vanity project by the president and the First Lady because their noses are out of joint by somebody saying things on the internet,” Tom Clare, the Macrons' attorney, told me. The lawsuit, though, has only brought more attention to the conspiracy, and the tabloidization of the drama has taken on increasingly lurid undertones. When news broke that the Macrons would provide “scientific evidence” of the First Lady's sex this fall, the right-wing internet laughed itself into a meme cycle about the idea that Brigitte Macron would present nudes in court. (The Macrons' intention was to provide photos of the First Lady when she was pregnant with her three children.) What has been overlooked in the press, but not by the Macrons' suit, is that Owens has not only accused Brigitte of being trans but also claimed that the couple has engaged in incest and murdered journalists. As the Macrons' suit states: Candace Owens is not in “the pursuit of the truth, but the pursuit of fame.” Earlier this year, the Macrons declined an offer by Owens to fly to Paris with her team to interview them.

In 2026, the Macrons' suit will move into discovery. Owens, meanwhile, has responded with more accusations, going so far as to say the Macrons hired an “assassination squad” to kill her. If she loses the suit, she'll likely call it a conspiracy. If she wins, she'll likely say the same. “They were probably betting I would at least shut up until we got to court,” Owens told me, giggling and clearly pleased with the trouble she's caused. “Wrong bet.”

One reason, among others, that Owens says she was suspicious about Kirk's murder is that the activist, she claims, was beginning to question his support for Israel. For most of their careers, she and Kirk had both been vocally supportive of Netanyahu's government, even attending the opening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem during Trump's first term. Last year, though, Owens switched her stance, calling the decimation of Gaza a genocide and bringing Norman Finkelstein on her show to discuss Palestinian history.

In the wake of the assassination, certain Kirk allies seemed anxious to affirm his support for Israel's war. Benjamin Netanyahu even released a letter Kirk sent him expressing his “deep love” for the country, also calling any claims of Kirk's wavering position, backed at the time by Tucker Carlson and Megyn Kelly, a “monstrous big lie.” Owens accused him of bastardizing Kirk's legacy. As she is prone to do, she took all of this as evidence that Israel, Netanyahu, and/or Mossad was involved in Kirk's death. (Owens has also said an Israeli national is on the Macrons' assassination squad.)

In Nashville, Owens attempted to convince me the real reason for her coming out as pro-Palestine was a moral one. During her third pregnancy, she says, she became horrified by what she was seeing on Instagram. “I remember looking at this trending video of this Palestinian girl that was pulled from the rubble and she looked like my daughter,” Owens told me. Up until this point in our conversation, she had been poised, her hands in her lap, never once touching the ice water in front of her. She now adopted the persona more familiar to her YouTube viewers — sterner, louder, more riled up. “There are children that are dying and there are politicians speaking about them on the other side of the world like they're rodents,” she said.

Like Tucker Carlson and Marjorie Taylor Greene, Owens is a central figure in a growing faction of conservatives leading a crack-up of the MAGA coalition that is ostensibly about Trump's continued support for Israel. Their concerns about funding this foreign war, though, have been clouded by other things they've said and done. In 2018, Taylor Greene accused the Rothschilds of starting California wildfires with lasers from space, which gave rise to the “Jewish space lasers” conspiracy; Carlson caused much consternation this fall when he interviewed the neo-Nazi Nick Fuentes.

Owens, too, has long courted antisemitic ideas. She resigned from Turning Point in 2018 after a panel with Kirk in London at which, while bumbling through a thought about the difference between globalism and nationalism, she ended up complimenting Hitler. (“If Hitler just wanted to make Germany great and have things run well, okay, fine.”) She was fired from the Daily Wire for similar reasons, and afterward peddled in antisemitic tropes about Ben Shapiro, the founder of that outlet, saying that he “cannot serve God and money.” She has long been in alliance with Kanye West, who famously tweeted, in 2018, “I like the way Candace Owens thinks”; in turn, she liked his infamous “Defcon 3 on Jewish People” tweet. Pressed on these issues, Owens has often brushed away accusations of antisemitism by saying she once worked for Jewish men, currently employs one, and even dated one once. (Similarly: She's not homophobic because she has a gay publicist.)

Between her newfound distance from Turning Point and the White House and party infighting over Israel and the Epstein files, Owens says she﻿ no longer identifies as a Republican, even promising to not vote for anyone within the party for the time being. In fact, she told me, she thinks of herself as a moderate now. “I think to be moderate is always an extreme position,” she explained, arguing that when emotions aren't so high — will they ever not be? — people will come to think of her as “sensible.” She seems excited to tell me this. “Do you think I'm a moderate?” she asked, raising an eyebrow. I didn't know what to say. It did occur to me that claiming that label is a good ploy for sanitizing her image and expanding her coalition. She believes she's converting liberals to her cause. “I think when people saw me through the lens of Trump, they didn't think that my perspectives were moderate,” she told me.  

Notably, in a series of focus groups conducted by The Bulwark and The Focus Group Podcast in swing states this year, Owens came up several times among female voters when asked who they believed should be president. “We need to see more representation from highly educated, unapologetic women that speak their minds that can honestly go toe-to-toe with the men,” said one Black woman, a Biden-to-Trump voter, in North Carolina. “If we would've swapped Candace for Kamala, they would've had this in the bag.” Another voter, in Pennsylvania, said, “There's just some things we're not being told. And it's just not adding up. She's really the only one who's willing to ask those hard questions and get to the bottom of it.” The others on the Zoom nodded along.

As Trump seemingly begins to lose his grasp on the base, maybe the party is heading in Owens's direction. Although she doesn't know him personally, she believes Vice-President J.D. Vance and she are probably more ideologically aligned. They may represent whatever MAGA might look like after Trump's cult of personality is dissolved. “Frankly, the cult is embarrassing more than anything else,” Owens told me. Her critics on the right have argued she's committing the left's most mortal sin: eating your own. Owens disagrees.

There's always a chance that if the country's paranoias starts drifting in another direction, she'll happily and emphatically abandon her beliefs and allies in favor of new ones. There's an equally possible chance she'll have another dream and will it into our reality.

Lisa Katz — Chief Government Affairs Officer of the Combat Antisemitism Movement (CAM) and former New Castle (New York) Town Supervisor — issued the following statement in response to Richmond (California) Mayor Eduardo Martinez's recent social media posts promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories about the Dec. 14 antisemitic terror attack at a Hanukkah celebration in Sydney, Australia: 

“Mayors have a civic duty to fight hate, not incite it. When an elected leader amplifies conspiracies that deny Jewish victimhood or blame Jews for atrocities committed against them, it is not ‘commentary,' but rather a modern repackaging of classic antisemitic tropes that have long fueled violence targeting Jews. That conduct is incompatible with public trust and makes Mayor Martinez unfit to hold office.”

“This is not theoretical. Fifteen people were murdered at a public Hanukkah gathering in Bondi Beach. In moments like this, leaders must help protect a targeted community, not further endanger it by legitimizing the same false narratives that inspire extremists.”

“In stark contrast to Mayor Martinez, nearly 600 elected officials from across the globe signed a CAM-organized letter this week expressing solidarity with the Australian Jewish community and calling for firm, concrete action to protect Jewish life and hold both perpetrators and propagators of antisemitic hate accountable. That message is just as pertinent in Richmond as everywhere else. We urge the Richmond City Council to formally censure Mayor Martinez's behavior, and demand a direct apology to Richmond's Jewish residents, as well as the Jewish people around the world.”

Recent fossil finds could mean that ""Lucy"" wasn't our direct ancestor, some scientists say. Others strongly disagree.

For a half century, the iconic ""Lucy"" fossil species, Australopithecus afarensis, has held the title of being the most likely direct ancestor of all humans.

But as the list of ancient human relatives has grown and more fossils have been discovered, Lucy's position has increasingly been called into question. Now, a key paper published last month in the journal Nature could overturn that theory entirely, some scientists say.

They argue that, given the new evidence, an older species, Australopithecus anamensis, was our direct ancestor, not Lucy.

The proposal has revealed intense disagreements in the field. Some say A. anamensis is our direct ancestor, others argue that we don't know which Australopithecus species we descended from, and still others say the new analysis doesn't shake up the human family tree at all.

The new discovery is ""not altering our picture of human evolution in any way, in my opinion,"" Zeray Alemseged, a paleoanthropologist and professor of organismal biology and anatomy at the University of Chicago who was not involved in the new study, told Live Science.

Either way, a resolution might not come until more fossils are found.

Understanding the roots of the debate requires going back a century. In 1925, Raymond Dart announced the discovery of the first known Australopithecus — a skull dubbed the Taung Child unearthed in what is now South Africa that dates to around 2.6 million years ago. For the next 50 years, researchers thought that humans descended directly from the Taung Child's species, Australopithecus africanus.

But Lucy's discovery in 1974 at the Hadar site in Ethiopia rewrote that picture. The 3.2 million-year-old fossil became the oldest known australopithecine specimen at the time.

And researchers found her species, A. afarensis, walked upright on two legs similarly to how humans do today, yet it had a smaller brain — about the size of a modern-day chimp's. This suggested Lucy's kind could represent a ""halfway"" point in human evolution between the last common ancestor with chimps and us, making her species a good candidate for our direct ancestor among the many known hominins, the lineage that encompasses humans and our closest relatives.

 




Then, in 1979, her status as our direct ancestor was cemented: an assessment of the evolutionary relationships among hominin fossils uncovered until that point suggested Lucy's species gave rise to the genus Homo. In that family tree, A. africanus was demoted from our ancestor to a more distant cousin.

As more australopithecines have been unearthed, the Australopithecus family tree has become bushier and more tangled, complicating the picture of who we may have descended from. But for many anthropologists Lucy's species still reigns, eventually giving rise to the lineage from which modern humans evolved.

Then the new Nature paper was published. Researchers had unearthed new fossil fragments and tied them to a previously discovered, enigmatic 3.4 million-year-old fossil known as the ""Burtele foot"".

The new tooth and jaw fragments allowed anthropologists to ascribe the foot, for the first time, to a little described and controversial species — Australopithecus deyiremeda, a tree-climbing ancient human relative that walked upright on two legs and lived alongside Lucy's species 3.5 million to 3.3 million years ago at the Woranso-Mille site in Ethiopia.

For Fred Spoor, a professor of evolutionary anatomy at University College London who was not involved in the recent study of the Burtele foot, the new discovery was the nail in the coffin for the theory Lucy's species was our direct ancestor.

 




That's because the paper suggested that the species tied to the Burtele foot and the South African A. africanus were more closely related to each other than either was to Lucy's species. By that logic, then, A. africanus may not have descended from Lucy's species, but was rather her cousin.

So, it's possible that both A. deyiremeda and A. africanus descended from the more ancient A. anamensis, who lived in East Africa from around 4.2 million to 3.8 million years ago.

This would also make A. anamensis the direct ancestor to humans, Spoor told Live Science in an email.

For Spoor, this finding would have huge implications. ""If this is correct, A. afarensis will lose its iconic status as the ancestor of all later hominins,"" probably including us, Spoor wrote in an accompanying commentary about the recent research.

But other anthropologists are hotly divided on the implications of the new paper.

Some Live Science spoke to thought Spoor's conclusions were plausible, while other experts said they were ""far-fetched"" and ""a stretch, to put it mildly.""

Because the existing fossil record in East Africa goes much further back in time than the current South African record, many believe the Homo genus arose in East Africa.

Currently the oldest known Homo fossil is a 2.8 million-year-old jawbone from Ethiopia, but models estimate the genus would have actually emerged around 0.5 million to 1.5 million years earlier.

This is older than many of the earliest South African hominin fossils, which were found thousands of miles away. That ""would make it unlikely that any of those are the direct ancestor,"" Carol Ward, the Curators' Distinguished Professor of pathology and anatomical sciences at the University of Missouri, told Live Science.

 Lucy's species is still a candidate, but no longer the candidate.

For many, the most likely candidate for an East African ancestor is still Lucy's species, A. afarensis, which lived in modern-day Ethiopia, Tanzania and Kenya from around 3.9 million to 3 million years ago. This wide geographic distribution and persistence for almost a million years means it had many opportunities to give rise to other species across Africa, Alemseged said.

Scientists in the ""Lucy"" camp argue that A. afarensis' fully upright mode of walking, broad diet, use of early stone tools and wide geographic range constitute strong evidence for Lucy's ancestral position in the human family tree.

This makes Spoor's claim that Lucy's species wasn't our direct ancestor a big one. But he isn't alone in this view.

Thomas Cody Prang, an assistant professor of biological anthropology at Washington University in St. Louis and a co-author of the Nature study, said it's possible A. afarensis evolved human-like features completely independently of modern humans, like how bats and birds independently evolved wings. Such convergent evolution has been proposed before in our family tree: For example, Prang's team previously found that A. afarensis and modern humans independently evolved certain body proportions.

If this is true, other species living at roughly the same time as Lucy's kind are likely ancestors to later hominins, Prang told Live Science in an email.

Prang, for his part, thinks A. deyiremeda's anatomy makes the species a better candidate for our direct ancestor than Lucy. That's because the species has a combination of ancient and new traits. What's more, a 2015 analysis flagged A. deyiremeda as being more closely related to Homo than Lucy's species.

Others think the Nature paper resurrects A. africanus as a plausible ancestor to Homo.

Lauren Schroeder, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Toronto Mississauga and who was not involved in the new study, said that either way, many different hominin species were evolving and intermingling across Africa during this 3.5 million to 2 million period of time. That means our evolutionary history is more like a braided stream, with species separating and then recombining, and less like a straight evolutionary line.

""Early Homo could have emerged from a broader, pan-African pool of australopith diversity. So yes, Lucy's species is still a candidate, but no longer the candidate,"" for a direct human ancestor, Schroeder told Live Science in an email.

Even the authors of the new paper disagree on its implications. While Prang supports the dethroning of Lucy's species as our direct ancestor, the study's lead author Yohannes Haile-Selassie, a paleoanthropologist and director of Arizona State University's Institute of Human Origins, insists that Lucy's species is still the best candidate for the direct ancestor to Homo.

—1 million-year-old skull from China holds clues to the origins of Neanderthals, Denisovans and humans

—'It makes no sense to say there was only one origin of Homo sapiens': How the evolutionary record of Asia is complicating what we know about our species

—DNA has an expiration date. But proteins are revealing secrets about our ancient ancestors we never thought possible.

He told Live Science in an email that the more ancient traits found in A. deyiremeda and A. africanus, like having feet adapted for climbing trees, contradict the idea that they are our direct ancestors. On the other hand, Lucy's species had more human-like feet, which Haile-Selassie said makes A. afarensis the ""more likely ancestor of those which came later.""

Of course, it's possible the smoking gun evidence that settles the debate will never come.

""We will almost certainly never know who our direct ancestor is — and the more we learn about human evolution and how diverse our past was, the more elusive that ancestor becomes,"" said Ward.

But that doesn't mean we'll ultimately understand less of our evolutionary past, Ward said. ""Even though we may never know which one was our ancestor, we can still piece together much of what that ancestor may have been like.""

In this article

Instacart said Monday it will cease the use of artificial intelligence-driven pricing tests on its grocery delivery platform after the practice was scrutinized in a wide-ranging study and rebuked by lawmakers. 

The company said in a blog post that retailers will no longer be able to use its Eversight technology to run pricing experiments on its platform, effective immediately. 

""We understand that the tests we ran with a small number of retail partners that resulted in different prices for the same item at the same store missed the mark for some customers,"" the company wrote. ""At a time when families are working exceptionally hard to stretch every grocery dollar, those tests raised concerns, leaving some people questioning the prices they see on Instacart. That's not okay – especially for a company built on trust, transparency, and affordability.""

Instacart acquired Eversight for $59 million in 2022. Eversight's software allows retailers to carry out pricing tests to gauge shoppers' reactions to higher or lower prices on certain items. 

Instacart said at the time that the technology would help retailers improve sales and growth, while ""also surfacing the best deals for customers.""

Earlier this month, a study by Consumer Reports and other organizations found that Instacart's algorithmic pricing tools caused shoppers to pay different prices for identical items from the same store. 

The total cost for the same basket of goods at a single store varied by about 7%, which can result in more than $1,000 in extra annual costs for customers. Instacart responded by saying that retailers determine prices listed on the app.

The company also rejected characterizations of the technology as surveillance pricing or dynamic pricing, and said the tests were never based on personal, demographic or individual-level user data. 

Reuters reported last week that the Federal Trade Commission had sent a civil investigative demand to Instacart about its pricing practices. 

Separately, Instacart last week was ordered to pay $60 million in refunds to customers to settle claims raised by the FTC that it used deceptive tactics in its subscription sign-up, ""satisfaction guarantee"" advertising and other processes. 

Instacart denied any allegations of wrongdoing. The company said it answered questions from the FTC about its AI pricing tools as part of that settlement.

Controversially appointed editor-in-chief Bari Weiss says: ‘I held that story and I held it because it wasn't ready'

CBS News was dealing with internal and external uproar on Monday after it pulled at the last minute an investigation for its flagship 60 Minutes show into the harsh prison in El Salvador where the Trump administration deported hundreds of Venezuelans from the US earlier this year.

The episode about the Cecot mega-prison was due to air on Sunday night. However, in an “editor's note” posted on X late that afternoon, the broadcaster's official account announced that “the lineup for tonight's edition of 60 Minutes has been updated. Our report ‘Inside Cecot' will air in a future broadcast.”

Outrage followed, including from the key correspondent on the planned segment, Sharyn Alfonsi. She had interviewed some of those recently released about the “brutal and torturous” prison conditions. The Paramount Plus website had said on Sunday the segment was scheduled to air at 7.30pm ET that evening.

Bari Weiss, controversially appointed editor-in-chief of CBS News in October despite a lack of experience and fears of politicization at the storied TV network, after owner Paramount acquired her conservative startup the Free Press, addressed the issue on Monday morning.

She spoke at the company's morning staff call amid reports that journalists at the news channel were threatening to quit and as parent company Paramount Skydance tweaked elements of its offer in the corporate battle to gain control of Warner Bros Discovery, which owns news rival CNN alongside its movie and streaming assets.

Weiss said: “I held that story and I held it because it wasn't ready.” She said the story presented “very powerful testimony” of abuse at Cecot but the issues had already been reported and it needed more. However she then said: “We need to be able to make every effort to get the principles on the record and on camera.”

This expanded on points made by a CBS News spokesperson on Sunday that the segment “needed additional reporting” and on reporting by the New York Times that the piece should include interviews with relevant leaders from the Trump administration. Alfonsi had previously said the administration did not provide comment despite multiple requests and invitations from 60 Minutes.

Weiss said the public was already aware of what happened at the prison, after the Trump administration accused more than 200 Venezuelan migrants in the US of being gang members and sent them to El Salvador without legal due process and on questionable evidence, in a deal with the authorities there to hold them in a notorious prison for terrorism suspects.

Weiss's address to staff on Monday echoed points made by a CBS News spokesperson on Sunday that the segment “needed additional reporting” and the reporting on pressure to include White House voices.

Alfonsi said in a private note to her CBS colleagues on Sunday that the episode “was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices. It is factually correct. In my view, pulling it now, after every rigorous internal check has been met, is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.”

Elsewhere in the note, Alfonsi said her team had requested comment from the White House, the state department, and the Department of Homeland Security. “If the administration's refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch' for any reporting they find inconvenient,” she said. “We have been promoting this story on social media for days.” She had directed those seeking further comment from her to approach Weiss.

Backlash from outside CBS was also swift. Weiss's appointment had already prompted concern that she would push news coverage to the right. But also that there was corporate politics at work as the merger of Paramount with Skydance in July had needed regulatory approval and now Paramount Skydance's rival bid to Neflix's for Warner Bros Discovery is a deal that also needs approval from Trump administration regulators.

“What is happening to CBS is a terrible embarrassment and if executives think they can build shareholder value by avoiding journalism that might offend the Mad King they are about to learn a tough lesson,” the Hawaii US senator Brian Schatz, a Democrat, wrote on X, with oblique reference to Donald Trump's increasingly autocratic agenda and related opposition. Schatz added: “This is still America and we don't enjoy bullshit like this.”

Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts saw the shadow of corporate dealmaking.

He said in an X post that it's a “sad day for 60 Minutes and journalism”, and added that the Trump administration's involvement in approving Skydance's $8bn deal to buy Paramount had previewed the decision.

The media commentator Kara Swisher posted on Threads that: “This is entirely to please Trump, who has voiced criticism of 60 Minutes under the new owners, who are the definition of rank amateurs, emphasis on rank.” And she added a reference to Weiss's push as reported by the New York Times for CBS to interview White House deputy chief of staff and anti-immigration adviser Stephen Miller as part of revising the segment.

“This Stephen Miller interview suggestion is idiotic in the context of this story – doing another piece with him later is fine, but to add him here after the administration declines to officially have comment is a suck up gimme,” Swisher wrote.

Weiss appealed for newsroom cooperation in her editorial conference comments on Monday.

“The only newsroom that I'm interested in running is one where we are able to have contentious disagreements about the thorniest editorial matters and do so with respect and crucially where we assume the best intent of our colleagues. And anything else is absolutely unacceptable to me and should be unacceptable to you,” she said, according to audiotape from the call.

In a highly diffused media environment, 60 Minutes remains a highly-watched news program averaging over 8 million viewers weekly in this, its 57th season, and so remains a prized media vehicle for political forces to seek to influence.

Accusations of political-favor seeking at Paramount-Skydance, and corresponding staff anxiety at the arrival of Weiss at CBS News, come as accusations of bias in the media have become commonplace.

Bob Thompson, media professor at Syracuse University, said many are formed from an older, and perhaps always illusory, aspirational idea of journalistic independence.

“So much of what comes in, whether it's from social media feeds, or from Fox News, CNN, MS Now, is not from that old-school idea of just-the-facts,” he said. “But before we get too nostalgic for the days Edward R Murrow who should remember that a lot of his best work was in fact advocacy journalism with a heavy dosage of opinion in it.”

But the idea that political interests seek spots of high ground in a flooded media plain should hardly come as a surprise.

“It's disturbing and contrary to what we think of as a healthy journalistic establishment – a fourth estate within a Republic – but it's also such common sense,” Thompson added. “So of course, that's what those folks are doing. Each one of those power nexuses is trying to secure a significant piece of the action.”

Donald Trump had “nothing to do” with the decision to remove photos featuring him from the Epstein files, the justice department said.

Criticism is mounting over the partial and heavily-censored release of thousands of documents related to the paedophile financier on Friday, with Democrats accusing Mr Trump of staging a “cover-up” to protect himself.

Among the files was an image showing photographs scattered over Jeffrey Epstein's desk, including two of Mr Trump.

One showed the president with Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is now serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, and Melania Trump, the first lady. In the other, Mr Trump is surrounded by scantily-clad women.

However, the image was deleted from the justice department's website on Saturday without explanation, along with 15 other documents.

Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general who formerly acted as Mr Trump's criminal lawyer, insisted on Sunday that the 16 removals came at the request of victim advocacy groups and that the president did not intervene.

He told NBC's “Meet the Press”: “We learned after releasing that photograph that there were concerns about those women and the fact that we had put that photo up.

“So we pulled that photo down. It has nothing to do with President Trump.”

Mr Blanche continued: “There are dozens of photos of President Trump already released to the public seeing him with Mr Epstein… so the absurdity of us pulling down a photo, a single photo because President Trump was in it is laughable.”

He pledged that every photo of the president in the Epstein files would be published.

However, Democrats on the House oversight committee claimed that the White House had engaged in a “cover-up” by suppressing the photo and demanded “transparency for the American public”.

The Trump administration was legally required on Friday to publish all the documents it holds on Epstein, who killed himself while awaiting trial in 2019. However, it is still working to redact the files in what it says is an effort to protect victims' identities.

Democrats have criticised the heavy redactions in what has been released and have suggested that senior justice department officials could be impeached or prosecuted for breaking the law.

Mr Blanche told NBC that he did not take the threat seriously and insisted that officials were “doing everything” to comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which Congress passed last month after several Republicans rebelled against Mr Trump.

“You're talking about a million or so pages of documents. Virtually all of them contain victim information,” he said.

“The idea that attorney general [Pam] Bondi would ever let a single piece of paper go out of this department that contains victim information is something they know we won't do.”

Thomas Massie, one of the congressmen behind the Epstein Files Transparency Act, said on Sunday he was drafting a motion to hold Ms Bondi in “inherent contempt” of Congress.

The rarely-used power could see the US attorney general fined or arrested and brought to trial, in what would be an extraordinary move against one of the administration's most senior figures.

Many of the images released on Friday were of Bill Clinton, the former president who repeatedly travelled with Epstein. One showed him relaxing half-naked with a woman in a hot tub.

A spokesman for Mr Clinton insisted that the former president cut ties with Epstein before his crimes came to light. They also accused the White House of using “grainy 20-plus-year-old photos” to deflect blame.

Mr Blanche declined to comment on whether Clinton was under investigation and called the claim by the spokesman “patently absurd”.

“The idea that we are hiding something or there's something that we have hidden under a rock around President Trump or other Republicans is not only false, but it's obviously false for anybody that's intelligent enough to think about what we're doing,” he said.

            In the latest blow to the US offshore wind industry, the Trump administration announced Monday it is suspending the federal leases for all large offshore wind projects currently under construction, citing unspecified national security risks.
    


            It marks a major escalation in President Donald Trump's attacks against offshore wind, a form of energy he has long railed against. The suspension could impact billions of dollars of investment and stall nearly six gigawatts of new electricity set to come online in the next few years.
    


            The new sweeping order impacts five projects being built in the Atlantic Ocean, including a massive Virginia offshore wind farm that could eventually be the largest such project in the nation. Set to be completed by the end of 2026, it would supply electricity to Virginia, the state with the world's largest cluster of power-hungry data centers — and skyrocketing energy costs partially tied to that growing demand. Other wind farms impacted are off the coast of New England.
    


            The exact national security risks of concern are unclear. In a news release, the Interior Department cited “national security risks identified by the Department of War in recently completed classified reports,” but didn't say specifically what those risks were. The release also noted the potential for wind turbine movement and light reflectivity to interfere with radar.
    


            In a Monday Fox Business interview, Interior Sec. Doug Burgum said the Department of Defense has “conclusively” determined that large offshore wind farms “have created radar interference that creates a genuine risk for the US,” especially “our east coast population centers.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the Department of Defense for comment on its new report.
    


            Last year, Sweden blocked the construction of new wind farms over concerns they could interfere with military radar, amid heightened tensions between the European Union﻿ and Russia. But experts have noted the design of wind farms can be adjusted to account for the issue, and it's something US government officials have been aware of for decades.
    


            In his Fox Business interview, Burgum said radar interference can “create real issues for trying to determine what's friend or what's foe in our airspace for our country” and suggested they could also create issues for commercial aircraft “given the proximity to all the large airports” on the East Coast.
    


            The Trump administration's move drew critiques from clean energy and fossil fuel groups alike.
    


            “Companies with roots in the oil and gas sector have committed substantial capital to participate in the build-out of our offshore wind sector,” Erik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association — a group that represents offshore oil, gas and wind companies. “We urge the administration end this pause and to resist taking further action that may harm jobs and investment.”
    


            Oceantic Network, a trade group representing offshore wind companies, said its member companies have worked with the Department of Defense for over a decade to address national security concerns.
    


            The Department of Defense has “signed off on every offshore wind lease ahead of construction,” said Liz Burdock, the group's president and CEO.
    


            Burdock called Interior's suspension “another veiled attempt to hide the fact that the President doesn't like offshore wind,” and said the move would kill American jobs by the thousands and raise electricity prices.
    


            “The US needs an all-of-the-above energy strategy, not an all-out assault on renewable energy based on personal preference,” Burdock said. 



            Burgum claimed offshore wind generates the most expensive form of electricity and said New England states should instead rely on Pennsylvania natural gas in his Monday interview.
    


            New England states had planned a buildout of offshore wind in an attempt to get more energy to the region, which has limited infrastructure for electricity generation. It is literally the last stop of the nation's natural gas pipelines and gets much of its natural gas shipped on ocean tankers.
    


            Meanwhile, mid-Atlantic states including Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia have been seeing high electricity bills driven by their own electricity supply shortages. Just last week, the regional grid operator for those states announced prices hit a record high at a regional auction. Virginia's Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin has led a push toward vast offshore wind buildouts in an attempt to satisfy that state's growing energy needs.
    


            The Virginia offshore wind farm is 60% complete, according to a recent state report, and would deliver more than two gigawatts of energy to the grid — enough to power around 660,000 homes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","An electricity crunch is driving high bills in these states. It's not getting better anytime soon","https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/22/climate/high-electricity-bills-maryland-new-jersey-pennsylvania","Mon, 22 Dec 2025 12:00:59 GMT","


            Residents of mid-Atlantic states like Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania who have spent years plagued by high electricity bills just got some bad news: Relief is not on the way.
    


As CNN recently reported, utility customers in Maryland and Washington, DC, are some of the first in the country to see the effects of the data center boom show up on their residential electricity bills. Much of that price increase is due to the anticipation of future demand. The energy industry can see that data centers and other customers are going to be pulling a lot more power just a few years from now. There's not currently supply to meet that, so access to the extra electricity that will be needed soon must be secured in advance.
    


            In the mid-Atlantic, those purchases are made through regional auctions. At a recent one, prices hit a record high — and would have gone up even more if not for a price cap set in the wake of a lawsuit brought by Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.
    


            Both the auction prices and the lawsuit reflect a growing dynamic in the region, which is home to the world's largest cluster of data centers — in Virginia — and more being added in other states including Ohio and Maryland. Data centers are consuming far more power than currently exists on the grid, driving prices higher amid a scramble to own the rights to future power.
    


            The auctions are run by PJM Interconnection, a little-known nonprofit whose goal is to ensure that there's enough electricity to meet demand and to move it where it's needed in the region. Other states in PJM's purview, including New Jersey, are also seeing spiking utility bills. Democrats in New Jersey seized on the issue in this year's governor's races. Democratic Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill campaigned heavily on the issue of energy affordability.
    


            That dynamic will continue in the near future, experts said.
    


            “I expect the supply scarcity will last a few more years and that most of the 65 million people in the region will be paying higher bills for that long,” said Rob Gramlich, CEO of consulting firm Grid Strategies LLC. “It is a shame that states and PJM failed to insulate consumers from volatile power markets.”
    


            PJM acknowledged the drastic imbalance between electricity supply and demand. Already in the past two years, prices have jumped more than 1,000%.
    


            “This auction leaves no doubt that data centers' demand for electricity continues to far outstrip new supply,” Stu Bresler, PJM's incoming chief operating officer, said in a statement, adding that “the solution will require concerted action involving PJM, its stakeholders, state and federal partners, and the data center industry itself.”
    


            The problem for customers is that prices will stay high until there's more electricity being generated, and the cost of building new power plants and the infrastructure to move electricity will also be expensive.
    


The secret behind your skyrocketing energy costs



            In the past two years, PJM has proposed over $11 billion or more in electrical infrastructure upgrades in the region, primarily to serve new data center load growth, and another $12 billion could be needed in the coming year, said Maryland People's Counsel David Lapp, the state's top official focused on consumer advocacy for utility bills.
    


            “The majority of those costs will be paid for by all customers even though the costs almost entirely are the result of data center development,” Lapp told CNN in an email.
    


            For now, even these record auction prices aren't enough to make ends meet, from a supply perspective. The latest PJM auction secured about 134,479 megawatts of power, which fell short of the amount the grid operator said it needs to ensure reliability for the region.
    


            The Electric Power Supply Association, a trade group for power plant operators, said it was focused on bringing new generation online.
    


            “Data centers can be built faster than new supply resources, like power plants,” Lapp said. “The market is not competitive because projected demand exceeds supply and new supply can't be timely built to restrain prices.”
    


            In a recent filing to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Shapiro said the regional grid operator must reform its system to protect consumers from rising costs.
    


            If that doesn't happen in the coming year, “the Commonwealth will be forced to take action to protect its ratepayers from unjustifiable price spikes,” Shapiro wrote. “The PJM region is facing an affordability and reliability crisis. The problem is not new, but it is growing worse.”

The National Center for Atmospheric Research has enabled life-saving predictions of wildfires and extreme weather.

As we produce journalism that combats authoritarianism, censorship, injustice, and misinformation, your support is urgently needed. Please make a year-end gift to Truthout today.

On December 16, USA Today broke the news that the Trump administration was planning to eliminate the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). According to a tweet by Russell Vought, an architect of Project 2025 and current director of the Office of Management and Budget, the administration had determined that the Colorado-based center was a hub for “climate alarmism.” Dismantling it — and farming out its surviving, non-climate-change-related functions to other agencies — would strike a blow against a scientific community that has come to the overwhelming conclusion that global warming is real, caused by human activities, and accelerating. Some commentators also noted that attacking NCAR, which employs 800-plus people, is a stick-in-the-eye to Colorado, a state whose governor has consistently opposed many of Trump's most extreme policies, and where election conspiracist and former county clerk Tina Peters resides in a state prison, after a federal judge ruled that she had to remain incarcerated despite her being pardoned for federal crimes by Trump. Peters was, after all, sentenced on state, rather than federal, charges, rendering Trump's pardon largely pointless.

NCAR has long been in team Trump 2.0's crosshairs. Previous proposals called for its funding to be slashed by 40 percent. The administration has also sought to end most climate-related research at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and websites for the Environmental Protection Agency have scrubbed mentions of human-caused climate change. As a result, institutions that were once considered among global gold standards for the delivery of accurate scientific information on the climate crisis are now effectively neutralized.

The administration's decision to go after NCAR is part of a broader retreat from any acknowledgement of the reality of climate change.

For the nation's thousands of meteorologists and climate change scientists, the news about the proposed gutting of NCAR landed like a grenade. After all, NCAR — which on a day-to-day basis is administered by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research on behalf of the National Science Foundation, but which is funded in large part by the federal government — has been the world's preeminent weather and atmospheric research institution since the 1960s. Its purpose is to pool institutional resources and expertise to provide researchers with cutting edge super-computers, data repositories, specialized aircraft with extremely expensive, sensitive, on-board measurement equipment, and other tools of the trade. No single lab or university, no matter how flush with money, has the ability to replicate all of this single-handedly. Few other institutions anywhere on earth can model weather, climate change, or other atmospheric disturbances so granularly.

NCAR's whole reason for existing, said University of Wisconsin-Madison Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Professor Ankur Desai, is to “supersize” the country's research resources. Desai did a post-doctoral fellowship at the Boulder institution; his work there led to his publishing a number of papers; those papers were what landed him his professorship in Madison. “It's the mecca of meteorology, and there's no place like it in the world,” he enthused.

Desai is not alone in his enthusiasm. Most of the country's top atmospheric scientists have, at one point or another, trained, studied, or carried out research at NCAR or using NCAR's resources. “I can write a proposal to the National Science Foundation saying I need a state of the art modeling system, and I need an aircraft,” said Kenneth Davis, professor of atmospheric and climate science at Penn State. Without NCAR's resources, he continued, “there's no way in hell that happens. These tools serve the U.S. research community in a way that would not be possible without a centralized institution like this.”

Davis cannot see any upside to breaking apart NCAR. “I don't see what you gain. The purpose is to smash. All it does is take away our ability to do important research work. U.S. universities get damaged by this.”

Desai's colleague at the University of Wisconsin, Liz Maroon, agreed. “The idea of losing this crowning jewel in the atmospheric science community, it would be devastating,” she said. “Having access to this kind of science is saving life and property. And its technology goes into improving national security and the economy.” Take away NCAR and you take away much of the country's ability to predict wildfire patterns, to better and more efficiently irrigate crops, and to give residents and businesses advanced warning about extreme weather.

Maroon explained that in addition to providing researchers with access to expensive technologies and providing storage repositories for decades of research data, NCAR also creates teaching materials used in schools and universities around the country. “NCAR is at the heart of atmospheric and earth systems science in the U.S.,” Maroon continued. “It allows the scientific community to do bigger things together that no one scientist or university could really do. The value of what NCAR has brought to the U.S. scientific community, to its citizens, and to the world should be self-evident.”

Around the country, scientists have begun pushing back against the administration's proposal, as are members of Colorado's congressional delegation, including Sen. John Hickenlooper, the former governor who has long been a champion of climate change research. Universities are also mobilizing their teams that liaise on federal issues to explain to the public and to Congress the vital importance of this institute and what will be lost if it is shuttered.

“This really seems existential for our field and certainly the U.S.,” said Desai. “It's a tantrum being thrown to break things, with no plan for how to fix things.”

Raymond Ban, former executive VP of the Weather Channel and an ex-trustee of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, hopes that the realization of what is at stake here will mobilize citizens, political leaders, and industry to push back against the administration's proposals. After all, he said, for more than 60 years, the NCAR has been “one of the most valuable R&D enterprises that we have in the earth, water, and atmospheric science community.” Want to study the way the sun and the earth interact? NCAR runs a high-altitude observatory, Ban notes. Want to know why there are fewer crash landings of airplanes during episodes of strong wind shear than there used to be?It's because in the 1980s researchers at NCAR designed a low-level wind shear alert system that was installed in airports around the United States to allow pilots to receive advanced warning if they were about to enter a wind shear zone.

“We need to hope that the value of NCAR and everything it produces will be realized, and there'll be voices in the decision room that will understand that value,” Ban said. “I'm hopeful that with enough input from the community and enough feedback the senior leadership of the National Science Foundation and the administration will take another look at this.”

December is the most critical time of year for Truthout, because our nonprofit news is funded almost entirely by individual donations from readers like you. So before you navigate away, we ask that you take just a second to support Truthout with a tax-deductible donation.

This year is a little different. We are up against a far-reaching, wide-scale attack on press freedom coming from the Trump administration. 2025 was a year of frightening censorship, news industry corporate consolidation, and worsening financial conditions for progressive nonprofits across the board.

We can only resist Trump's agenda by cultivating a strong base of support. The right-wing mediasphere is funded comfortably by billionaire owners and venture capitalist philanthropists. At Truthout, we have you.

“There is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines cause cancer,” the National Cancer Institute says.

As we produce journalism that combats authoritarianism, censorship, injustice, and misinformation, your support is urgently needed. Please make a year-end gift to Truthout today.

Last week, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced the appointment of Harvey Risch, an epidemiologist and professor emeritus at Yale University, to the President's Cancer Panel.

Risch has a long history of researching cancer prevention methods. But during the coronavirus pandemic, he peddled disinformation to the public, baselessly sowing doubt in the use of mRNA-based vaccines and promoting untested treatment methods.

In a statement accompanying the announcement of Risch to the cancer panel, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — himself a promoter of anti-vaccine sentiments and conspiracy theories — claimed that Risch will “confront the factors driving cancer rates, and provide the public with science they can trust.”

Risch expressed appreciation for his appointment. “I am thankful for the opportunity President Trump has given me to transform cancer prevention in the United States,” he said. 

Risch has previously faced criticism for his views on COVID vaccines.

In 2023, Risch postulated a possible link between mRNA-based vaccines, like those used in some COVID shots, and supposed “turbo cancers” — parroting the debunked conspiracy theory that cancer is sped up in people who receive such vaccinations. Risch expressed his views on a conservative podcast, suggesting that rising rates of cancer in young people could be connected to the vaccines. 

Most experts agree, however, that generational differences in diet, lifestyle, smoking, and alcohol consumption are likely to blame for higher cancer rates. There is no scientific evidence backing Risch's beliefs, and indeed, the rise in cancer diagnoses for young people pre-dates the availability of COVID-19 vaccines. 

“There is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines cause cancer, lead to recurrence, or lead to disease progression,” the National Cancer Institute says on its website.

In the same interview, Risch claimed that vaccines have done “various degrees of damage to the immune system,” leading to people “getting COVID more often” or “getting other infectious diseases” and “perhaps cancer in the longer term.” Those claims are disputed by studies and experts, who widely agree that the immune system is not detrimentally affected, overall, by COVID shots, and that vaccines reduce the likelihood of a person contracting COVID. 

Risch also offered errant advice in the first few months of the pandemic. In May 2020, he argued in favor of using hydroxychloroquine as a treatment method for COVID, despite no evidence suggesting that the antimalarial medication would be effective in treating COVID. At the time, federal health officials opposed using the medication, although President Donald Trump had wrongly claimed it was a “game-changer.”

Multiple studies later found that hydroxychloroquine was ineffective at treating coronavirus.

Risch's appointment comes as agencies within HHS have pushed numerous questionable claims about vaccines. A recently published internal memo within the FDA, for example, claimed that at least 10 children died as a result of adverse actions from COVID vaccines. A subsequent investigation discovered that that assertion was made before a preliminary examination of those deaths, and that the actual number of children dying from the vaccine could be as high as seven or as low as zero.

Americans in general are losing trust in HHS and its various agencies, in large part due to disinformation peddled by Kennedy.

A Quinnipiac University poll published in September found that only 33 percent of Americans approve of Kennedy's job performance, while 54 percent expressed disapproval. The same poll found that only 39 percent of respondents had confidence that the information Kennedy provided to the public was accurate, with 57 percent saying they didn't have confidence in his statements.

December is the most critical time of year for Truthout, because our nonprofit news is funded almost entirely by individual donations from readers like you. So before you navigate away, we ask that you take just a second to support Truthout with a tax-deductible donation.

This year is a little different. We are up against a far-reaching, wide-scale attack on press freedom coming from the Trump administration. 2025 was a year of frightening censorship, news industry corporate consolidation, and worsening financial conditions for progressive nonprofits across the board.

We can only resist Trump's agenda by cultivating a strong base of support. The right-wing mediasphere is funded comfortably by billionaire owners and venture capitalist philanthropists. At Truthout, we have you.

            Denmark's foreign minister said Monday he was “deeply upset” by US President Donald Trump's appointment of a special envoy to Greenland who declared that he wished to see the island become part of the United States.
    


            “I am deeply upset by this appointment of a special envoy. And I ‌am particularly upset by his statements, which we find completely unacceptable,” Lars Løkke Rasmussen told Denmark's national broadcaster TV 2, according to Reuters news agency.
    


            Rasmussen said he would summon the US ambassador to Denmark in response to the Trump administration's move, Reuters reported.
    


            On Sunday, Trump announced the appointment of Jeff Landry, the Governor of Louisiana, as ‌special envoy to Greenland. “Jeff understands how essential Greenland is to our National Security, and will strongly advance our Country's Interests for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Allies, and indeed, the World,” Trump posted on Truth Social.
    


            While thanking Trump for his appointment, Landry said it was an “honor to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the U.S.” He also said that “this in no way affects” his position as Louisiana governor.
    


            Trump has repeatedly stated that he wants to annex Greenland – a huge, resource-rich island in the Atlantic and self-governing territory of Denmark – claiming that this is needed for American security purposes.
    


            Both Greenland and Denmark, a NATO ally of the US, are staunchly opposed to the idea.
    


            Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen reiterated their opposition Monday to US plans to take over Greenland, stating “you cannot annex another country. Not even with an argument about international security,” according to Reuters.
    


            “Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders and the US shall not take over Greenland,” they said in a joint statement.
    


            Nielsen said earlier Monday that Trump's announcement “may sound big, but it does not change anything for us. We decide our own future,” Reuters reported.
    


            Vice President JD Vance made a controversial visit to the island in March, repeatedly claiming that it was vulnerable and that the US had “no other option” than to ramp up its presence there.
    


            In August, the US envoy to Denmark was summoned by the Danish foreign ministry after the country's public broadcaster reported that several American men had attempted to conduct “influence operations” in Greenland.
    


            Rasmussen said earlier that the new appointment “confirms the continued American interest in Greenland,” Reuters reported. “However, we insist that everyone – including the US – must show respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark.”
    


            Meanwhile, European Union spokesperson Anouar El Anouni said that “preserving the ⁠territorial integrity ​of the Kingdom of Denmark, its ‍sovereignty ‍and the inviability of its borders is essential for the European Union.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Monday suspended leases for five large-scale offshore wind projects under construction along the East Coast due to what it said were national security risks identified by the Pentagon.

The suspension, effective immediately, is the latest step by the administration to hobble offshore wind in its push against renewable energy sources. It comes two weeks after a federal judge struck down President Donald Trump's executive order blocking wind energy projects, calling it unlawful.

The administration said the pause will give the Interior Department, which oversees offshore wind, time to work with the Defense Department and other agencies to assess the possible ways to mitigate any security risks posed by the projects. The statement did not detail the national security risks. It called the move a pause, but did not specify an end date. 

“The prime duty of the United States government is to protect the American people,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement. “Today's action addresses emerging national security risks, including the rapid evolution of the relevant adversary technologies, and the vulnerabilities created by large-scale offshore wind projects with proximity near our east coast population centers.”

Wind proponents slammed the move, saying it was another blow in an ongoing attack by the administration against clean energy. The administration's decision to cite potential national security risks could complicate legal challenges to the move, although wind supporters say those arguments are overstated.

AP correspondent Marcela Sanchez reports on which offshore wind projects are being put on hold and why.




The administration said leases are paused for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind in Rhode Island and Connecticut, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind.

The Interior Department said unclassified reports from the U.S. government have long found that the movement of massive turbine blades and the highly reflective towers create radar interference called “clutter.” The clutter caused by offshore wind projects can obscure legitimate moving targets and generate false targets in the vicinity of wind projects, the Interior Department said.

National security expert and former Commander of the USS Cole Kirk Lippold disputed the administration's national security argument. The offshore projects were awarded permits “following years of review by state and federal agencies,” including the Coast Guard, the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, the Air Force and more, he said.

“The record of decisions all show that the Department of Defense was consulted at every stage of the permitting process,” Lippold said, arguing that the projects would benefit national security because they would diversify the country's energy supply.

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I, said Revolution Wind was thoroughly vetted and fully permitted by the federal government, “and that review included any potential national security questions.” Burgum's action “looks more like the kind of vindictive harassment we have come to expect from the Trump administration than anything legitimate,'' he said. 

The administration's action comes two weeks after a federal judge struck down Trump's executive order blocking wind energy projects, saying the effort to halt virtually all leasing of wind farms on federal lands and waters was “arbitrary and capricious” and violates U.S. law. 

Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump's Jan. 20 executive order blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful. 

Saris ruled in favor of a coalition of state attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, that challenged Trump's Day One order that paused leasing and permitting for wind energy projects.

Trump has been hostile to renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and prioritizes fossil fuels to produce electricity. Trump has said wind turbines are ugly, expensive and pose a threat to birds and other wildlife.

Wind supporters called the administration's actions illegal and said offshore wind provides some of the most affordable, reliable electric power to the grid.

“For nearly a year, the Trump administration has recklessly obstructed the build-out of clean, affordable power for millions of Americans, just as the country's need for electricity is surging,” said Ted Kelly of the Environmental Defense Fund.

“Now the administration is again illegally blocking clean, affordable energy,” Kelly said. “We should not be kneecapping America's largest source of renewable power, especially when we need more cheap, homegrown electricity.''

The administration's actions are especially egregious because, at the same time, it is propping up aging, expensive coal plants “that barely work and pollute our air,” Kelly said.

Connecticut Attorney General William Tong called the lease suspension a “lawless and erratic stop-work order” that revives an earlier, failed attempt to halt construction of Revolution Wind. 

“Every day this project is stalled is another day of lost work, another day of unaffordable energy costs, and other day burning fossil fuels when American-made clean energy is within reach,” Tong said. “We are evaluating all legal options, and this will be stopped just like last time.” 

A New Jersey group that opposes offshore wind hailed the administration's actions.

“Today, the president and his administration put America first,'' said Robin Shaffer, president of Protect Our Coast New Jersey, a nonprofit advocacy group.

“Placing largely foreign-owned wind turbines along our coastlines was never acceptable,” he said, arguing that Empire Wind, in particular, poses a threat because of its close proximity to major airports, including Newark Liberty, LaGuardia and JFK.

Offshore wind projects also pose a threat to commercial and recreational fishing industries, Shaffer and other critics say. 

Dominion Energy, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, said the project is essential for national security and meeting Virginia's dramatically growing energy needs, driven by dozens of new data centers.

“Stopping CVOW for any length of time will threaten grid reliability ... lead to energy inflation and threaten thousands of jobs,” the company said in a statement.

The Conservation Law Foundation, a Boston-based environmental group, called the pause “a desperate rerun of the Trump administration's failed attempt to kill offshore wind,'' noting that courts have already rejected the administration's arguments.

“Trying again to halt these projects tramples on the rule of law, threatens jobs and deliberately sabotages a critical industry that strengthens — not weakens — America's energy security,” said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the law foundation.

FIRST ON FOX: President Donald Trump's Department of Interior announced on Monday that, effective immediately, leases for all large-scale offshore wind projects being constructed in the United States will be paused.

In a press release, DOI wrote that the pause is due to ""national security risks"" identified by the Department of War in ""recently completed classified reports.""

In a press release, DOI says the pause will ""give the Department, along with the Department of War and other relevant government agencies, time to work with leaseholders and state partners to assess the possibility of mitigating the national security risks posed by these projects.""

""The prime duty of the United States government is to protect the American people,"" Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, said in the press release.

A 60 Minutes segment detailing the Trump administration's deportations to a maximum security prison in El Salvador was pulled Sunday night, stirring controversy within the news organization.

The correspondent who reported the story, Sharyn Alfonsi, accused new CBS News Editor-in-Chief Bari Weiss of “spiking” the segment after Weiss said it needed further reporting to air.

A note from 60 Minutes said, “The broadcast lineup for tonight's edition of 60 Minutes has been updated. Our report ‘Inside CECOT' will air in a future broadcast.”

Alfonsi sent an email to her colleagues expressing her frustration that Weiss pulled the segment, which she called a “political” decision. She said they had reached out to relevant government sources for a response but failed to receive one and noted that her story had been cleared by the news organization's lawyers and standards team.

Alfonsi suggested Weiss wanted government sources to be interviewed and argued that CBS News has handed the Trump administration a “kill switch” for any story it finds “inconvenient” if the network chooses to air stories without a government response. She also said the administration's failure to respond is a “tactical maneuver” designed to “kill” the story.

“If the standard for airing a story becomes ‘the government must agree to be interviewed' then the government effectively gains control over the 60 Minutes broadcast. We go from an investigative powerhouse to stenographer for the state,” she wrote.

Alfonsi said the inmates at the Salvadoran prison “risked their lives” to speak to CBS News and that the program was indebted to them for speaking.

She said pulling the story now will stir controversy.

“Our viewers are expecting it. When it fails to air without a credible explanation, the public will correctly identify this as corporate censorship,” she wrote. “We are trading 50 years of ‘Gold Standard' reputation for a single week of political quiet. I care too much about this broadcast to watch it be dismantled without a fight.”

When contacted for further comment by the New York Times, Alfonsi referred all questions to Weiss.

Weiss suggested the piece was held because it didn't include “critical voices” and was missing “context.”

“My job is to make sure that all stories we publish are the best they can be. Holding stories that aren't ready for whatever reason — that they lack sufficient context, say, or that they are missing critical voices — happens every day in every newsroom. I look forward to airing this important piece when it's ready,” she told the New York Times.

Weiss gave the contact information for White House aide Stephen Miller to the show's producers after she saw the segment and raised concerns with it, the New York Times reported. She also took issue with the program's use of the term “migrants” for the men instead of saying “illegal immigrants.”

Weiss arrived at CBS News in October after leading the Free Press. Her arrival came shortly after her news site was bought by David Ellison, a Trump ally, and CBS's parent company, Paramount Skydance.

Ellison acquired Paramount earlier this year after settling a lawsuit with the Trump administration for $16 million. President Donald Trump had brought the suit and has since said the new leadership is not treating him any better.

“For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that 60 Minutes has treated me far worse since the so-called ‘takeover,' than they have ever treated me before,” Trump wrote on Truth Social last week.

CBS News has been accused of skewing more conservative after Weiss took over, recently interviewing Turning Point USA CEO Erika Kirk, the widow of the assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk, for one hour in a town hall event. The CECOT story's disappearance from the broadcast drew further controversy.

“This CBS thing does merit an explanation right away. It's a pretty big deal to pull a story at the request of the White House. And if that's not what happened everyone should know that too,” Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI) wrote on X.

Schatz added, “What is happening to CBS is a terrible embarrassment and if executives think they can build shareholder value by avoiding journalism that might offend the Mad King they are about to learn a tough lesson.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has called for a national “gun buyback” program in the wake of the Bondi Beach massacre. But additional restrictions on gun ownership aren't the solution. Instead, they'll distract from larger, more difficult problems to solve.

On December 19, Albanese announced that the Australian government will establish a “national gun buyback scheme.” The prime minister told reporters that he “expects hundreds of thousands of firearms will be collected and destroyed.” 

Albanese's proposal came less than a week after the Bondi Beach massacre, in which two gunmen murdered 15 Jews and wounded at least 40 more at a Hanukkah celebration. Authorities say that Naveed Akram and his father Sajid Akram deliberately targeted Australia's Jewish community. Australian officials have said that the attack was inspired by ISIS, noting “the presence of Islamic State flags in the vehicle that has been seized.”

NETANYAHU SAYS HE WARNED AUSTRALIA OF POLICIES FUELING ‘ANTISEMITIC FIRE' MONTHS BEFORE SHOOTING

The Bondi Beach massacre highlights the dangers of both rising antisemitism and Islamic extremism. But more gun control won't solve either. In fact, it may make things even worse. Australia already has highly restrictive laws on gun ownership.

In 1996, the country passed the National Firearms Agreement (NFA) prohibiting many commonly used rifles, shotguns, and other long guns. The NFA was enacted after the Port Arthur massacre, in which a mass murderer killed 35 people and wounded 23 others in the state of Tasmania.  Subsequently, licenses were required for all firearms purchases, and a minimum of a 28-day “cooling-off period” was also instituted. Concealed carry for citizens is prohibited and self-defense is not considered a “genuine reason” for owning a firearm. Many states also have restrictions on how many firearms an individual can possess. 

Australia has also pushed “buyback” schemes in recent years. A permanent “amnesty” has been in place since 2021, allowing unregistered firearms to be turned in without penalty. But these measures have failed. Estimates vary as to how many firearms remain in circulation in Australia, but most studies agree that a majority of firearms have not been turned in. This is unsurprising. 

By definition, criminals break laws. And gun legislation is no exception. Those who are about to murder, rob, or terrorize are unlikely to be concerned with defying a mere gun law. By criminalizing gun ownership, politicians target law-abiding citizens, depriving them of their ability to protect themselves. In the United States, many cities with the highest homicide rates, like Chicago, Washington, D.C., and New York City, have tight restrictions on gun ownership.

Nor do gun laws prevent massacres. For example, in November 2015, Islamic State terrorists carried out an attack at the Bataclan theatre in Paris, murdering 130 people and injuring 400 more. France, like many nations in Europe, has very tough gun laws. The AK-47 rifles used in the attack were prohibited. Terrorists acquired them anyway. But the type of weapon matters less than the ideology behind the person who is wielding it.

TRUMP ANNOUNCES DEALS WITH NINE MORE DRUG MANUFACTURERS

Indeed, the Bondi Beach terrorists seemingly used a shotgun and a bolt-action rifle, old designs that have long been out of date and would be considered archaic for any front-line law enforcement or military agency. Neither impeded them from murdering those who lacked the ability to defend themselves.

Ultimately, blaming guns distracts from dealing with problems with less tangible solutions, like countering violent extremism and dangerous ideologies. It provides the government with the illusion of doing something meaningful instead of tackling more politically fraught problems.

Former Minneapolis mayoral candidate Omar Fateh slammed Vice President JD Vance on Sunday after he joked at Turning Point USA's AmericaFest that Fateh was running for “mayor of Mogadishu.”

Fateh is ethnically Somalian but was born in the United States.

“Nice try @JDVance,” Fateh wrote on X. “My father came to America on a scholarship in the early 60's, during the civil rights era, and earned a masters in engineering. I was born in DC and proud to represent MPLS in the MN Senate. Looks like you took time away from the couch to try out comedy.”

The Democratic Minnesota state senator lost to incumbent Mayor Jacob Frey in November's mayoral election after receiving Rep. Ilhan Omar's (D-MN) endorsement.

Vance hit out at Fateh and Omar as he was criticizing Democrats for the quality of their candidates.

“They are not sending their best,” he said. “Omar Fateh was Ilhan Omar's candidate for mayor of Mogadishu — I mean Minneapolis. Little Freudian slip there.”

Others also readily slammed Vance for his comments.

“Wow so authentic,” Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) wrote on X.

“He has the humor and charisma and comic timing of a wooden pillar. Say what you want about Trump but at least he knows how to deliver his burns and putdowns,” Mehdi Hasan, the CEO of left-leaning news outlet Zeteo, also wrote on social media.

INTERNAL MINNESOTA ATTORNEY GENERAL MEMO SETTLES DEBATE ON SOMALI FRAUD

Vance's comments come as controversy swirls around the Somali community in Minnesota over widespread alleged welfare fraud by the ethnic group in the state. President Donald Trump said earlier this month that he didn't want Somalis in the country.

“They contribute nothing. I don't want them in our country,” Trump told reporters. “We can go one way or the other, and we're going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Girls Play Dead is a transformative analysis of what sexual assault does to women.

“There is no single anecdote,” Jen Percy writes in the opening sentence of Girls Play Dead, her riveting, heartrending analysis of what sexual assault does to women. “What I'm talking about is an accumulation.” She lists a few of her own encounters with harassment and rape culture: the man who rubbed his crotch while staring at Percy and her friend; the man working a cash register who asked to touch her breasts; the man who asked to photograph her when she was 16, showing her an album of naked women. The point isn't to interrogate the men who supposedly did these things, or whether they happened. (With regard to veracity, I have my own accumulation of similar anecdotes; I'm guessing most women do.) More useful is to consider what Percy did in response, what so many do when faced with sexually threatening behavior: nothing.

Girls are socialized to be pleasant. To be passive. To neutralize conflict rather than spark it. They learn to prioritize others' feelings over their own. In 1988, the feminist legal scholar Robin West argued that these habits and behaviors help foster intimacy and community, but that they also diminish women's protection under the law. If someone's instinct is to preserve relationships and stability as a matter of survival, what do they do when they're violently or sexually threatened? Not always something that might be construed as logical, or that might convince a jury that they have been gravely violated. The majority of women who are sexually assaulted don't fight back, Percy notes. (In addition to “fight or flight” responses to danger, advocacy groups indicate that other common responses to rape include “freeze,” “flop,” and “friend,” or trying to placate one's attacker.) She compiles a list of accounts from her reporting of things women have done after they were raped. “I made him chicken soup,” one woman tells her. “I comforted him because he was crying,” another says. Still another: “I told him I couldn't wait to do it again.”

Girls Play Dead began as a feature Percy wrote in The New York Times Magazine about the phenomenon of “tonic immobility,” a self-preservation mechanism that leads people to freeze or become paralyzed when under attack. In the animal kingdom, mammals play dead so that a predator will lose interest in them; some female dragonflies do it to avoid mating. Percy encounters so many women who describe freezing as their response to sexual assault that she pronounces it a kind of “lingua franca.” (Men freeze too, she notes; her focus is largely but not exclusively on women.) “I just froze,” Lady Gaga said in an episode of the series The Me You Can't See, while recalling the time she was raped at 19. “I just absolutely froze,” Brooke Shields said of her own rape in the documentary Pretty Baby. While I was reading Girls Play Dead, I watched a BBC documentary in which a woman, recounting being raped by her own boyfriend, said, “The fact that I froze—it's a feeling that absolutely takes over your body. You can't move.” Tonic immobility, Percy writes, is an “extreme response to a threat” that “renders victims unable to scream or move their limbs.” Its evolutionary benefit, she notes, is that by simultaneously numbing the body, it might—in the animal world at least—“alleviate the agony and horror of being eaten alive.”

Percy's subject is brutal, but her writing allays some of the impact by being almost impossibly beautiful: crisp, vulnerable, lyrical. Her mother, a naturalist, raised her partly in the wilderness, where hills “were painted with belts of ochre, orange, brick-red sand.” Sometimes the pair slept in a trailer, “with its stale formaldehyde smell, lacquer table, and tiny fridge that gasped as if afraid.” She has a miniaturist's eye for detail and a raw compassion in her analysis. Girls Play Dead isn't a manifesto, or a call to action. It's more like a scientist's collection of samples from a field trip, arranged by genus. Percy observes and bears witness. She interviews women in prison for murdering their abusers, after describing their biographies at harrowing, hard-to-read length. She interviews self-professed sex and love addicts who experienced childhood abuse and whose understanding of emotional connection got distorted. (“Abuse, neglect, or drama—it was all mistaken for intimacy,” Percy writes.)

On first reading, some of Percy's stories seemed strange or incongruous, like the man she profiles who's utterly obsessed with a woman he broke up with a decade ago. But I came to understand that woven into her line of inquiry are the nature and significance of storytelling itself. Police investigations and criminal trials demand clear narratives: They tend to expect evidence to be neat, behavior to be logical, and stories to be linear. The questions that rape victims tend to face don't allow for the kind of messiness that accompanies violation. Often survivors themselves try to make sense of what has happened by reinterpreting it. “Self-preservation doesn't always look like what we imagine it does,” Percy notes. She describes once going home with a man while studying abroad in Spain, and all of the times she said no, until she finally stopped, because “I was tired and I didn't want to be rude.” Later, she went to Paris with him. Illogical, maybe, but commonplace all the same, because occasionally our coping mechanisms require transforming an abuse into something wanted, or at least something not so bad.

Read: Unbelievable is TV's most humane show

In a court of law, though, irrational reactions—such as a sustained relationship with an abuser—can fatally undermine a victim's credibility. Defense lawyers, Percy writes, have a pronounced tendency “to portray the normal behavior of women, both during and after their experiences, as ‘unusual' or ‘inconsistent.'” During the trial of Harvey Weinstein, his defense lawyers put significant emphasis on the fact that two of his accusers had continued friendly communication with him after their alleged attacks, and had even gone on to have consensual sex with him. “Many individuals may not understand why I had hoped that attempting human connection with the man who was sexually abusing me, humiliating me, using me, and pumping me into his world where he always controlled the script—was a long exhausting form of survival,” one accuser, Jessica Mann, read in a statement to the court during Weinstein's sentencing hearing, by way of response. We are, as a culture, deeply uncomfortable with the idea of victimhood. (Consider the idiom “playing the victim.”) “Claiming victimhood,” Kate Manne writes in her book Down Girl, “effectively involves placing oneself at the center of the story.” And women who foreground themselves in any capacity are often perceived to be self-important drama queens, or narcissists.

Perhaps sensing this, Percy turns victims into a collective instead. Her stories, woven together, become something like a fabric, a totality. Messiness is the defining feature, in a way that becomes clarifying. Chronic stress damages the prefrontal cortex, she writes in one chapter, explaining how trauma can impair the brain so that her later accounts of women found guilty for acts of self-defense seem even more profoundly unjust. Girls Play Dead illuminates how stories can trap people, how the impulse to rewrite a violation or rescue an abuser leads us away from the truth. But Percy also seems to feel that showing us the texture and shared features of human experience might be the crucial thing that can make a difference. The law often renders women unprotected, maligned, and misunderstood. The only countermechanism, as Robin West wrote in 1988, “is to tell true stories of women's lives,” in such breadth and definition that the justice system finally has to acknowledge what it's been obscuring. Girls Play Dead is a vital continuation of this effort.

Paramount Skydance on Monday revised its hostile bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, without increasing the price, after WBD's board affirmed its backing of rival Netflix's offer.

In Paramount's new offer, the company said Larry Ellison, one of the richest people in the world and father to Paramount CEO David Ellison, agreed to provide an irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion of the equity financing for the offer. Paramount said Ellison also agreed not to revoke the long-standing Ellison family trust.

This change by Paramount directly responds to objections raised by the WBD board in response to its last offer. Paramount had previously said its bid was fully backstopped by the elder Ellison, but the WBD board said the bid relied ""on an unknown and opaque revocable trust"" whose assets or liabilities were subject to change.

In its new bid, Paramount also said it would match the termination fee Netflix offered, upping its fee to $5.8 billion from $5 billion if the deal doesn't get through the regulatory process.

""Paramount has repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to acquiring WBD,"" David Ellison wrote. ""Our $30 per share, fully financed all-cash offer was on December 4th, and continues to be, the superior option to maximize value for WBD shareholders.""

In the new bid, Paramount stuck with its $30 per share price for the whole company. Netflix's bid is $27.75 per share for only WBD's studios and streaming business. That excludes WBD's cable TV channels, such as CNN, which is part of a business that WBD plans to spin off in 2026. One aspect of the dueling bids is the value of those cable channels, which produce a lot of cash but are in secular decline. A high valuation favors Netflix while a lower one favors Paramount.

Raymond James analysts wrote on Monday that they still expect WBD to stick with Netflix's bid. WBD now has less reason to push back on Paramount, however, if it increases its offer. The analysts wrote that they expected Paramount would ultimately go as high as the mid $30s.

Paramount's stock rose more than 5% on the news while WBD's ticked up about 3%. Netflix's declined less than 1%.

With its hostile bid on December 8, Paramount took its case directly to Warner Bros. shareholders after WBD's board chose Netflix. WBD laid out in detail last week why it recommended shareholders stick with Netflix's bid. Another consideration: WBD would have to pay Netflix $2.8 billion if it were to back out and go with Paramount instead at this point.

The process is expected to be drawn out. WBD board chair Sam DiPiazza said last week that a shareholder vote wouldn't happen until at least the spring.

The bidding war for some of Hollywood's crown jewels has riveted the entertainment world. The outcome would significantly reorder Hollywood. If Paramount wins, it would move up in the streaming rankings and become the owner of two major TV news outlets, CBS News and CNN. If Netflix emerges victorious, it would cement its lead as the top global paid streamer.

In this article

The Trump administration on Monday halted Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, the largest project of its kind in the U.S., as well as four other projects under construction off the East Coast in a devastating blow to the wind industry. 

Shares of Dominion Energy, the utility developing the project, dropped more than 5% on the news. 

The administration also paused leases for Vineyard Wind 1 off Massachusetts, Revolution Wind off Rhode Island, Sunrise Wind off Long Island and New England, and Empire Wind 1 south of Long Island. 

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said the administration paused leases for the projects due to national security concerns identified by the Pentagon. 

Shares of Denmark's Orsted, the developer of the Revolution and Sunrise projects, tumbled 11%. Norway's Equinor, the developer of Empire Wind 1, was down less than 1%. 

Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind is a 176 turbine project project that would provide enough power for more than 600,000 homes, according to Dominion. The project was expected to be complete next year. 

Dominion said the massive project is essential for U.S. national security and Virginia's dramatically growing energy needs. Northern Virginia is the largest hub for data centers in the world. Growing demand from artificial intelligence is contributing to higher electricity prices in the state. 

""Stopping CVOW for any length of time will threaten grid reliability for some of the nation's most important war fighting, AI, and civilian assets,"" Dominion said in a statement. 

""It will also lead to energy inflation and threaten thousands of jobs,"" the utility said.  

Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, supports the project. Incoming Gov. Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat, won the gubernatorial election in November on a promise to address rising electricity costs in part by expanding renewable energy. 

The Interior Department said in a statement that the pause will give the federal government time to ""work with leaseholders and state partners to assess the possibility of mitigating the national security risks posed by these projects."" 

Interior said the U.S. government found that turbine blades and ""highly reflective towers"" create radar interference risk. 

""The clutter caused by offshore wind projects obscures legitimate moving targets and generates false targets in the vicinity of the wind projects,"" Interior said. 

President Donald Trump has targeted the U.S. wind industry since his first day in office. Trump on Jan. 20 ordered a halt to all new leases and permits for onshore and offshore wind pending federal review. 

Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., condemned Trump's campaign against wind projects as ""irrational."" The senate minority leader said Interior's decision would spike energy bills.  

""Trump's obsession with killing offshore wind projects is unhinged, irrational, and unjustified,"" Schumer said in a statement Monday. ""At a time of soaring energy costs, this latest decision from DOI is a backwards step that will drive energy bills even higher."" 

Trump's campaign against the wind industry has run afoul of the courts. Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts ruled on Dec. 8 that Trump's order was ""arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law.""

Asset manager Janus Henderson has agreed to be acquired by investors Trian Fund Management and General Catalyst, CNBC first reported on Monday. 

Trian and General Catalyst will pay $49 per share in cash, valuing Janus at about $7.4 billion. That represents a 6.5% premium to Janus' Friday's close and is about 18% above the stock's closing level on Oct. 24.

The deal is expected to close in mid-2026, they said.

Trian has been an investor in Janus since late 2020. In that time, the stock has roughly doubled. Trian also has two representatives on the company's board.

With the acquisition, ""we see a growing opportunity to accelerate investment in people, technology, and clients,"" Trian CEO Nelson Peltz said in a statement.

Janus Henderson CEO Ali Dibadj said, ""With this partnership with Trian and General Catalyst, we are confident that we will be able to further invest in our product offering, client services, technology, and talent to accelerate our growth.

Janus shares ticked more than 3% higher on the news.

Trump Media just added 451 Bitcoin to its holdings, bringing its total to 11,542 BTC worth over $1 billion as part of its ongoing crypto treasury strategy.

Trump Media & Technology Group just beefed up its bitcoin portfolio, acquiring an additional 451 Bitcoin valued at roughly $40.3 million. 

The move brings the company's total Bitcoin holdings to 11,542 coins, now worth more than $1 billion, according to analytics firm Arkham.

The latest purchase continues Trump Media's broader crypto treasury strategy. Earlier in 2025, the company reported around $2 billion in Bitcoin and related digital assets as it increasingly positions itself as a crypto‑focused investment entity.

In July, Trump Media announced plans to launch the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, with Crypto.com serving as the exclusive custodian, prime execution agent, staking, and liquidity provider. Yorkville America Digital, LLC was named as the fund's sponsor. 

The ETF's launch was contingent on SEC approval of a Form 19b-4 filing and the effectiveness of its registration statement.

The fund was structured as a Nevada business trust, issuing and redeeming shares in blocks of 10,000 through authorized participants, using cash for creation and redemption. While in-kind transactions were not initially offered, they could be implemented later pending regulatory approval. 

Trump Media said at the time that the shares could not be sold or purchased until the SEC registration statement became effective.

At the time of writing, shares of Trump Media & Technology Group ($DJT) are down nearly 10% on the day. That being said, the stock saw its stock surge dramatically last week following an unexpected all-stock merger announcement with TAE Technologies, valuing the combined entity at over $6 billion. 

Shares jumped roughly 42% on Thursday, adding more than half a billion dollars to the Trump family's holdings, climbed another 8.3% on Friday, and rose 3.6% in Monday premarket trading. 

The merger pivoted TMTG from a social media play into a fusion energy venture, with plans to build nuclear fusion plants to power artificial intelligence operations.

Trump Media went public in 2024 via a SPAC merger and is headquartered in Sarasota, Florida, with Devin Nunes as CEO. 

TMTG focuses on social networking, streaming through Truth+, and financial services with a FinTech brand Truth.Fi. 

It's majority‑owned by the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust.

Bitcoin is currently priced at $89,358, with a 24-hour trading volume of $38 B. Its price has risen 2% in the past 24 hours, sitting slightly below its 7-day high of $90,353 and above its 7-day low of $87,948. 

The circulating supply is 19,965,603 BTC out of a maximum 21,000,000 BTC, giving Bitcoin a market cap of about $1.78 trillion, which reflects a 2% change over the past day.

A bipartisan duo in the U.S. House of Representatives is circulating a draft bill that would streamline tax rules for investors, traders and developers by explaining how they would handle reporting their taxes on staking, low value transactions and wash sales.

Representatives Max Miller of Ohio and Steven Horsford of Nevada unveiled the Digital Asset Protection, Accountability, Regulation, Innovation, Taxation, and Yields (PARITY) Act on December 20. The proposal aims to modernize the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by eliminating excessive taxation on everyday crypto transactions, addressing “phantom income,” and closing gaps that lawmakers say invite tax abuse.

“America's tax code has failed to keep pace with modern financial technology,” said Miller “This bipartisan legislation brings clarity, parity, fairness, and common sense to the taxation of digital assets. It protects consumers making everyday purchases, ensures the rules are clear for innovators and investors, and strengthens compliance so everyone plays by the same rules.”

The PARITY Act includes targeted tax exemptions for regulated stablecoins, optional tax deferral on staking and mining rewards and new rules aligning digital assets more closely with traditional securities and commodities. It would exempt capital gains tax on low-value stablecoin transactions under $200, provided the tokens are dollar-pegged, actively traded and issued by a federally regulated entity.

The bill would also apply longstanding wash sale rules to crypto, preventing traders from harvesting tax losses while keeping similar positions. Additionally, it proposes a mark-to-market accounting election for active digital asset traders, requiring annual recognition of gains and losses based on fair market value. A separate provision applies the “constructive sale” doctrine to crypto, targeting derivative-based hedging strategies that defer tax indefinitely.

Other measures include granting nonrecognition treatment to certain digital asset loans, excluding NFTs and thinly traded tokens, and extending tax benefits to foreign investors who trade crypto through U.S. brokers. While most provisions would take effect upon enactment, the stablecoin exemption would begin in tax years starting after Dec. 31, 2025.

“Today, even the smallest crypto transaction can trigger tax calculation while other areas of the law lack clarity and invite abuse,” said Horsford. “Our discussion draft of the Digital Asset PARITY Act takes a targeted approach that provides an even playing field for consumers and businesses alike to benefit from this new form of payment.”

Animal cell types are defined by differential access to genomic information—a process orchestrated by the combinatorial activity of transcription factors that bind to cis-regulatory elements (CREs) to control gene expression. Changes in these gene regulatory networks (GRNs) underlie the origin and diversification of cell types, yet the regulatory logic and specific GRNs that define cell identities remain poorly resolved across the animal tree of life. Cnidarians, as early-branching metazoans, provide a critical window into the early evolution of cell type-specific genome regulation. Here we profiled chromatin accessibility in 60,000 cells from whole adults and gastrula-stage embryos of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. We identified 112,728 putative CREs and quantified their activity across cell types, revealing pervasive combinatorial enhancer usage and distinct promoter architectures. To decode the underlying regulatory grammar, we trained sequence-based models predicting CRE accessibility and used these models to infer cell type similarities that reflect known ontogenetic relationships. By integrating sequence motifs, transcription factor expression and CRE accessibility, we reconstructed the GRNs that define cnidarian cell types. Our results show the regulatory complexity underlying cell differentiation in a morphologically simple animal and highlight conserved principles in animal gene regulation. This work provides a foundation for comparative regulatory genomics to understand the evolutionary emergence of animal cell type diversity.

A divided three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the University of Washington violated a computer science professor's First Amendment rights when it investigated and reprimanded him for posting a parody land acknowledgment in a syllabus.

The professor, Stuart Reges, has taught at UW's Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering since 2004. In January 2022, he included his own land acknowledgment in a syllabus for an introductory programming course, pushing back against the school's recommendation that faculty include a statement recognizing Coast Salish peoples.

His version invoked philosopher John Locke's labor theory of property to argue the opposite point — that indigenous peoples could claim “almost none” of the land occupied by UW.

The statement sparked student complaints, a public apology from the Allen School, a disciplinary investigation lasting more than a year, and a separate section of the course taught by another instructor. 

Reges was ultimately not formally sanctioned, but was warned that repeating the statement could lead to discipline — a threat the court said itself violated the First Amendment.

Represented by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, Reges sued the UW in 2022. A district court sided with UW, but the Ninth Circuit reversed that decision last Friday, Dec. 19.

Writing for the majority, Judge Daniel Bress said student discomfort cannot justify retaliation against a professor's speech on matters of public concern. 

Judge Sidney Thomas dissented, arguing that the disruption that Reges' statement caused to Native students' learning outweighed his First Amendment speech interests.

Potential next steps for the University of Washington could include asking for a rehearing from the full Ninth Circuit or an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the university does neither, the case returns to district court to determine remedies.

The UW said in a statement that it is weighing its options “We maintain that we have a responsibility to protect our students and that the UW acted appropriately,” the UW statement said.

The team at Retro, a photo-sharing app for close friends and family, is experimenting with how generative AI can be put to more creative uses. To try out the latest, cutting-edge AI technologies, the team built a new app called Splat, which lets you turn any photo into a coloring book page for kids.

As any parent will tell you, kids love to color. And thanks to the web, there's a seemingly infinite number of coloring book pages available for printing at home. 

However, many of the websites hosting these pages are filled with ads and other clutter, making them difficult to navigate. Other times, the printable pages are only available for a small fee, which some parents don't want to pay, given the disposable nature of much of kids' scribbled-on art projects.  

That inspired Retro's team to develop an app for printing coloring book pages at home — from either your own photos or those it provides in kid-friendly, educational categories, such as animals, space, flowers, fairy tales, robots, cars, and more.

To get started with Splat, you'll take a picture or pick a photo from your Camera Roll. You can then choose what style of photo you'd like to color — such as anime, 3D movie, manga, cartoon, or comic. The app will then transform your picture using AI into either an on-screen or printable page for kids to color.

Instead of requiring a tedious sign-up process, the app will step you through customization options the first time you begin creating. Here, you're prompted to choose your preferred app icon and check off the various categories your child likes. You also can choose if you want to let kids color the photo as a printable page or on-screen (great in a pinch when kids are bored, but you don't want them sucked into a TV show or game).

You can try one generative AI project to get a feel for the app. It then costs either $4.99 per week or $49.99 per year to continue to generate new pictures. The weekly option allows for 25 pages per week, and the annual option provides 500 pages per year. The option to purchase or access the settings is blocked from small children by a pop-up that requires the parent's birth year.

In brief tests, the app worked as promised, and the generation time was brief, allowing you to quickly move from idea to printed art, ready for coloring, cutouts, or anything else your child wants to do. 

Splat is one of several experiments that uses generative AI to help inspire kids' creativity and imagination in new ways. Another, Stickerbox, offers printed AI-generated stickers for coloring, while Casio also launched a fluffy robotic pet called Moflin that uses AI to develop its personality over time.

Splat is available on iOS and Android.

Vaccines are in more danger than ever before. Over the weekend, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. nearly succeeded at shrinking down the childhood vaccine schedule.

On Saturday, Politico reported that Kennedy canceled a press conference set for Friday afternoon where he would have formally advised that parents follow the vaccine schedule implemented in Denmark—a system with several fewer vaccine recommendations. Experts have largely opposed the proposed change, noting that the two countries are vastly different from each other. RFK Jr. reportedly balked at the last second due to concerns the decision would face political and legal challenges.

RFK Jr. and his allies have been signaling this potential change for quite some time.

At the last meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in early December, Tracy Beth Høeg, acting director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), gave a presentation about Denmark's vaccine schedule. Høeg and others have argued that the U.S. should consider adopting Denmark's schedule. Denmark universally recommends childhood vaccines for 10 diseases, whereas the U.S. universally recommends vaccines for 16 diseases (that number was 17 until the recent ACIP-led change to revoke its recommendation for the hepatitis B vaccine).

The Worst Ways RFK Jr. Has Harmed Public Health This Year

Soon after, President Donald Trump stated that he would push to change the U.S. vaccine schedule to match that of other “peer countries” and issued an executive order on December 5 to that effect. This set the stage for HHS last Thursday to announce a press conference for the next day, where RFK Jr. was expected to officially recommend the Danish vaccine schedule as an alternative for parents in the U.S. to follow.

But it seems the administration grew cold feet mere hours after it announced the press conference. An anonymous senior HHS official told Politico that the HHS Office of the General Counsel deemed that the abrupt change would likely result in a successful lawsuit against the agency. A second official added that the decision would be “politically risky.”

An HHS spokesperson told Gizmodo that any reasons for the press conference's cancellation not provided by HHS are “pure speculation.”

To be clear, Kennedy and others have never presented a reasonable case for such a sweeping change to the vaccine schedule.

There is no credible evidence that the amount or timing of vaccines currently recommended in the U.S. poses a health risk to children—a reality still acknowledged by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (for now). Some anti-vaccination proponents have also argued that specific ingredients commonly included in vaccines, such as aluminum, could be dangerous if given repeatedly, but the majority of studies have not found any such risk, including one published just this past summer.

Experts have also pointed out that while Denmark does recommend fewer vaccines in general than the U.S., there are important reasons why this schedule isn't easily transferable to the latter. For one, Denmark has a universal health care system that's much more robust than the U.S.'s fragmented system. This includes improved screening for vaccine-preventable diseases like hepatitis B. Notably, the U.S. once tried to vaccinate only high-risk groups for hepatitis B but eventually switched to a universal system after cases failed to significantly decline; this approach then helped dramatically reduce new infections, particularly among newborns.

‘We Are Doing Harm': RFK Jr.'s ACIP Guts Universal Hep B Vaccination at Birth

Leaving that aside, plenty of other high-income countries are much closer to the U.S. in the number of vaccines they recommend to their residents, including Canada, Germany, and Japan, to name a few. Some countries are also following the U.S.'s example and adding more vaccines to their schedule, such as the U.K., which will introduce the chickenpox vaccine to its routine starting next year.

Even health officials in Denmark are baffled by the attempt to use the country as justification for Kennedy's trimming of the U.S. schedule.

“It's not at all fair to say look at Denmark unless you can match the other characteristics of Denmark,” Anders Hviid, the lead researcher on vaccine safety and effectiveness at the Statens Serum Institut (Denmark's equivalent to the CDC), told the New York Times Friday. “It is surreal, and it is difficult, from a Danish perspective, to understand what's going on.”

It's certainly possible that some vaccines aren't or will eventually not be worthwhile for children in the U.S. to routinely receive. But any changes should be carefully weighed and discussed by actual health experts and researchers, not abruptly implemented under the radar on a Friday afternoon by politicians who have a clear anti-vaccine bias like RFK Jr.

Unfortunately, while Kennedy may have been stymied this time, it's almost certain that this won't be his last such attempt.

The official standard time of the United States is kept by around 10 to 15 atomic clocks at NIST laboratories in Boulder, Colorado. That's clearly an important job, so the agency has backup generators in case the local grid fails due to, say, an unfortunate weather incident. But there wasn't a backup generator for the backup generator when, last Wednesday, a powerful windstorm knocked out the power in Boulder.

The atomic clocks did have a battery backup system that kept them going for a while, but the “atomic ensemble time scale” failed due to a disconnect between some of the clocks and NIST's measurement systems, according to a community email by NIST supervisory physicist Jeffrey Sherman on December 19.

“One impact is that the Boulder Internet Time Services no longer have an accurate time reference,” Sherman added. As a result, the U.S. official time slowed by around 4.8 microseconds—a timeframe that is “both big and small at the same time,” Sherman told NPR.

NIST, short for the National Institute of Standards and Technology, officially became America's timekeeper in 2007 through the America COMPETES Act. As part of the Department of Commerce, NIST collaborates with the U.S. Navy to determine the precise time in the United States.

More informally, NIST and its predecessor, the National Bureau of Standards, had been managing the official time reference for industries like stock exchanges and the electric power sector since at least the 1960s.

Today, NIST's standard time serves as a reference point for things like telecommunications and GPS signals. The atomic clock ensemble is a mix of hydrogen masers and cesium beam clocks, which produce a weighted average of physical signals that NIST researchers use to keep time.

The level of precision for atomic time is, quite literally, on the atomic scale. For context, the international standard for “1 second” corresponds to the “duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium-133 atom,” according to NIST. What this means is that the slightest dissonance in the ensemble can cascade into serious errors.

To be fair, the 4.8 microsecond “drift” would be far too small for the general public to notice—the reason Sherman described the error as “both big and small.” To NPR, NIST clarified it had given “high-end” users access to other timekeeping networks to minimize disruptions from the Colorado power outage.

NIST staff was also able to address the issue in a reasonable amount of time. The power outage lasted around two hours, and critical operations staff on duty immediately activated a reserve diesel generator to keep the clocks running.

“Additional quick action by NIST facility staff secured temperature control for the most sensitive clocks,” Sherman added in a follow-up community message on Sunday. As of December 21, utility power had returned to NIST's facilities, and “assessment and repair activity is in progress.”

Wafer stages, optical elements, sensors, and control subsystems are alleged to be upgraded via secondary channels

Chinese fabs are quietly extending the useful life and performance of older ASML deep ultraviolet lithography systems by upgrading key subsystems, as Beijing pushes to sustain advanced chip output under tightening U.S. and allied export controls, according to the Financial Times. The effort concerns installed immersion DUV tools, particularly ASML's Twinscan NXT series. It's understood that these activities have been underway over the past year at several leading-edge Chinese fabs, including those operated by SMIC and other state-backed manufacturers.

With access to EUV scanners cut off and new restrictions narrowing what ASML can legally service or upgrade, Chinese firms are increasingly turning to reverse engineering and grey-market components to improve overlay accuracy, stability, and throughput on tools originally designed for older process nodes. While this upgrade activity will never bring older DUV machines to parity with newer EUV machines, it could provide Chinese manufacturers with a meaningful recovery of capacity at advanced DUV-based nodes that remain commercially viable.

 




Export controls imposed by the U.S. and its allies were primarily designed to prevent the export of cutting-edge technologies to China. For lithography, that meant blocking EUV outright and, more recently, placing tighter licensing requirements on the most capable immersion DUV scanners.

While these measures have worked as intended at the point of sale, they haven't eliminated the installed base of immersion scanners already operating inside China. Over the past decade, Chinese fabs acquired dozens of high-end DUV tools, which now form the backbone of China's most advanced production lines, particularly for 14 nm, 10 nm, and experimental 7 nm-class processes that rely heavily on multipatterning. Despite tens of billions in capital expenditure on chipmaking tools, China remains more than a decade behind current market leaders.

Under current rules, ASML is allowed to provide basic maintenance and support to keep these tools running, but it is restricted from performing upgrades that would materially improve performance beyond narrow thresholds. That has created a gap between what the original equipment manufacturer can legally do and what fabs are technically capable of doing with the right parts and expertise.

Into that gap has stepped a growing ecosystem of third-party suppliers and engineers. According to the report, Chinese fabs have sourced replacement or upgraded components such as wafer stages, optical elements, sensors, and control subsystems through secondary markets. Some of these parts originate from dismantled tools outside China, while others are produced by suppliers that operate in regulatory grey zones. Installation and calibration work is carried out by independent engineers, including former lithography specialists, rather than by ASML personnel.

This might sound inconsequential on the face of it, but with an outright ban on exports of new tooling, marginal improvements to existing tools compound quickly across high-volume lines. A small improvement in overlay stability can translate into higher yields across dozens of layers.

 




The primary challenge Chinese fabs will face in upgrading older DUV machines is overlay — the precision with which each new lithography layer aligns with previously-exposed layers. At older nodes, modest overlay errors are tolerable, but not at advanced nodes manufactured without EUV. Multipatterning schemes such as self-aligned double or quadruple patterning dramatically increase the number of exposures required per layer, and each exposure introduces additional misalignment risk.

ASML's own product pages for the NXT immersion platform make clear how tightly overlay and system stability are linked. Wafer stage accuracy affects not only positioning but vibration and thermal drift, both of which become limiting factors as pattern density increases. Upgrading or replacing these subsystems can claw back some performance that would otherwise be lost to wear and aging. Even without changing the core exposure wavelength or numerical aperture, better stages and sensors can improve effective overlay and reduce the number of wafers scrapped due to misalignment.

This does not eliminate the structural disadvantages of DUV at 7nm-class geometries: Cycle times remain longer than EUV-based processes, costs per wafer are higher, and yields are generally lower. But for products where absolute cost is less critical than domestic supply and technical continuity, these penalties are acceptable.

From a policy perspective, the actions of these firms highlight a shift in which enforcement pressure must be applied to constrain output. Blocking new tool shipments has already occurred, so the harder problem is constraining the flow of parts, expertise, and process knowledge that keeps existing tools competitive — at least for now.

Updates to U.S. BIS rules last year point in this direction, with expanded controls on semiconductor manufacturing equipment components, software, and services. Restrictions increasingly target not only lithography scanners themselves but also metrology tools, process control software, and advanced sensors that indirectly affect yields. The logic is to close the pathways that allow incremental upgrades to accumulate into meaningful capacity gains.

Even so, enforcement potential is limited. Lithography tools are complex systems with long service lives, and many components are designed to be replaceable. Distinguishing between a like-for-like replacement and a performance-enhancing upgrade is technically and legally difficult, particularly when work is performed by third parties rather than the OEM.

 




China, for its part, seems to be pursuing parallel strategies. Stretching DUV capability through upgrades is one track; developing domestic lithography tools is another. SMIC has tested homegrown immersion DUV prototypes, and state-backed programs continue to fund long-term EUV research, even if breakthroughs remain distant.

At the end of the day, we're not about to see a sudden leap in Chinese semiconductor capability because a few fabs have upgraded their machines. What we could see, however, is a slower erosion of the gap that export restrictions were designed to maintain.

DUV will continue to significantly lag EUV-based competitors on both cost and efficiency, but they are unlikely to stagnate at their initial performance levels. Incremental improvements in yield and throughput can sustain meaningful volumes of advanced chips for domestic use, particularly in areas such as networking silicon and specialized processors.

Ditch Valve's handheld and pick up this faster Steam Deck rival instead


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Valve has officially discontinued the LCD Steam Deck, so if you're looking for a powerful handheld gaming PC that isn't going to break the bank, then this Lenovo Legion Go S is your answer. Amazon have dropped the price of this Lenovo handheld back to under $600, offering better specs, along with Valve's very own SteamOS to rival Windows 11.

Priced at just $589.99 right now, this Lenovo handheld is one of the more affordable ways to play your Steam library on-the-go. You can use handhelds like this as an alternative to a console, as well as to bulkier, more expensive PCs and laptops. You can, if you're very quick, still pick up this handheld in time for delivery ahead of Christmas, saving you 14% on Amazon's list price in the process.

As far specs go, we've put this Lenovo Legion Go S portable on our best handheld gaming PCs guide as one of the more powerful alternatives to the now-aging Steam Deck. The Legion Go S currently comes in two hardware variants, but this is the cheaper model, featuring the AMD Ryzen Z2 Go APU.

The Lenovo Legion Go S is a budget-friendly handheld gaming PC. This model features the AMD Ryzen Z2 Go APU, with four CPU cores, along with an RDNA 2-based AMD Radeon GPU with 12 compute units. It has 16GB of LPDDR5X-6400 RAM, a 1TB SSD with Gen 4 speeds, as well as an 8-inch IPS display with a 120Hz refresh rate, along with VRR support.

This processor is one of the few physical hardware differences that you'll find between the two models currently on sale. The AMD Ryzen Z2 Go is a Zen 3+ processor, fitted with four CPU cores and eight threads, along with a boost clock speed up to 4.3 GHz. The built-in Radeon GPU it includes is RDNA 2-based with 12 compute units and a TDP of between 15 and 30W. Compare and contrast to the Steam Deck, which uses a Zen 2-based, custom-designed Van Gogh APU, which features only four CPU cores, along with an RDNA 2 GPU with only eight compute units.

When we put this handheld to the test in our Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS review, this Z2 Go variant proved to be less powerful than the more expensive Z1 Extreme model, but the gulf between them isn't huge, and running SteamOS is certainly a better option for gamers than running it with Windows 11. Frame rates remained playable in several intensive games that we tested, including the notorious CPU-heavy Cyberpunk 2077 at 800p, which was able to maintain 50fps on average. The same handheld with Windows 11 installed, meanwhile, was only able to manage 32fps.

Coupled with this AMD processor is 16GB of LPDDR5X-6400 RAM and a 1TB PCIe 4.0 SSD for storage. You're also getting an 8-inch IPS display, which features a native resolution of 1,920 x 1,200, along with a variable refresh rate of 120 Hz. This means that you can game at 1200p, even using the Z2 Go APU, but you'll find that better frame rates in the most resource-heavy games are available if you drop down to 800p or less.

The decision by Valve to discontinue the most affordable Steam Deck makes this Lenovo Legion Go S handheld even better value. This device doesn't feature an OLED panel like the similarly-priced Steam Deck OLED, but it does have a bigger screen (8-inch vs 7.4), along with a higher native resolution and VRR support, coupled with the already-mentioned superior gaming performance.

The Lenovo Legion Go S also features a bigger 55.5 Whr battery which we found in our review to last for around two hours while using the device's power-saving profile. You're also getting double the storage capacity (1TB vs 512GB) against the soon-to-be entry-level Steam Deck OLED for only $40 more.

Ultimately, though, it's SteamOS that makes this handheld truly great. Yes, Microsoft is trying to improve the handheld experience on Windows 11, but SteamOS continues to be the best option for handheld gaming, especially on cheaper hardware. Valve's efforts to improve Linux gaming on handhelds for Steam Deck owners are available to you to by running SteamOS, thanks largely to the Proton compatibility layer, which unlocks access to a huge library of handheld-compatible games on Steam.

The market for any kind of gaming machine, be it a laptop, PC, console, or a handheld like this Lenovo is under threat at the moment. As SSD and RAM prices continue rising, handhelds are currently one of the most affordable devices for picking up and playing PC games, with this Lenovo Legion Go S running SteamOS sitting near the top of the pack. The $589.99 sale price makes it one of the most competitively-priced handhelds left to rival the Steam Deck, but as those chip prices begin to rise, it might not stay below $600 for long — if you want it, you best grab it quickly.

After books, music is the next target for Anna's Archive.

Spotify, the largest music streaming platform in the world with hundreds of millions of active users, and an extensive library of music has allegedly been hacked by Anna's Archive. The shadow library, who labels itself as archivists, has apparently scraped nearly the entirety of the platform, downloading roughly 300 TB of music that is now being distributed illegally via torrents.

Spotify has already acknowledged and responded to this attack, issuing the following statement to Android Authority:

""An investigation into unauthorized access identified that a third party scraped public metadata and used illicit tactics to circumvent DRM to access some of the platform's audio files. We are actively investigating the incident.""

That ""some"" in the above comment is key because the leaked collection consists of around 86 million files in particular, representing ~37% of all music available on the platform (but 99.9% of listens). Most of them are preserved in Spotify's original OGG Vorbis 160 kbps format, but if any song has a popularity rating of exactly 0, then they've been re-encoded to 75kpbs to save space.

With that, there's 256 million rows of metadata that accounts for 99.6% of all listens on Spotify and it has been complied into query-able SQL databases. The group has done a near-lossless JSON reconstruction of Spotify's API, including 186 million unique ISRCs. — identifiers for individual recordings worldwide; think of them as ISBNs for music. All the album info, artist info, cover art etc., is included.

 




The blog post released by Anna's Archive going over this leak is surprisingly informative, including a bunch of charts that break down how Spotify treats music in general. For instance, around 70% of all songs on the platform barely get any attention, while 0.1% of the tracks are the most popular of all time. Most songs are also singles, rather than part of an album, and 120 BPM is the most common tempo.

Anyhow, the reason for this large-scale hack, as described by Anna's Archive itself, is preservation of music. Since the group is notorious for open-sourcing books without consent, it's applying much of the same logic here, arguing that Spotify's collection is too overtly focused on popular artists and sound quality. There needs to be an ""authoritative list of torrents aiming to represent all music ever produced.""

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

The torrents are self-hosted, and the files are packaged using Anna's Archive Containers (AAC), a custom format the group has used for years. The metadata has already been released while the rest of the data will follow a staggered release pattern in huge chunks, categorized by popularity. Therefore, the aftermath of this scrape will only truly show up down the line.

 December 22, 2025  

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has released a new framework to guide the integration of wastewater-based surveillance (WBS) into infectious disease surveillance.

The ECDC highlighted the following five key ways it aims to help countries implement WBS: supporting the development of a European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA)-level WBS system, offering lab support, identifying candidate pathogens, helping with data integration, and identifying the best database and reporting options.

The framework was published following EU legislation that introduced new national requirements for multiple activities related to wastewater monitoring.

“The new ECDC framework is crucial for unifying methodological and analytical procedures across the EU/EEA,” Pavel Březovsky, MD, of the Department of Soil and Waste Hygiene at the Center for Health and Environment, Prague, Czech Republic, told Medscape News Europe.

“This [framework] will ensure that data from different countries are comparable and usable for a pan-European risk assessment. The proposed establishment of a European WBS Network is particularly vital,” he added.

“WBS testing can add significant knowledge on the circulation of pathogens,” Marion Koopmans, PhD, scientific director of the Pandemic and Disaster Preparedness Centre in Rotterdam, Netherlands, told Medscape News Europe. “A key advantage is its representativeness. During the peak of the pandemic, when there was massive testing, the added value became less clear, but currently, WBS is a reliable source of information on how much COVID-19 is circulating,” she said.

Not everyone is enthusiastic about WBS, however. Estonia introduced large-scale WBS during the COVID pandemic but has discontinued these efforts due to questions about the value of the data that they provide, Tanel Tenson, PhD, professor of antimicrobial technologies at the University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia, told Medscape News Europe.

“The EU mandates are often fulfilled at the minimal level possible or even less, and this is currently happening or going to happen to wastewater surveillance,” he said.

For WBS to receive more investment, more data would be needed to analyze its real effects, such as how it affects numbers of new infections, or “how many lives it saves,” according to Tenson.

“Currently, if asked whether to use limited resources for improving the collection of patient information or WBS, I would recommend the first option.” he said, adding that Estonia “really doesn't understand how to act on WBS surveillance data.”

Opponents of WBS usually don't argue that WBS doesn't detect the virus, but rather that the data it produces don't change the public health response, Březovsky said.

“If the state does not have the capacity or political will to implement measures earlier than on the basis of full hospitals, then WBS is just an expensive thermometer.” It indicates that it's hot outside when everyone already knows, he said.

In smaller countries like Estonia, he added, clinical systems can be so efficient and centralized that WBS provides less added value than it does in more fragmented countries, such as the Czech Republic, which takes a more “proactive path” to WBS.

The supporters of WBS recognize potential bottlenecks in its implementation. While Finland has a long tradition of implementing WBS for surveilling polio and enteroviruses, Tarja Pitkänen, PhD, of the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare,Helsinki, Finland, told Medscape News Europe that attention is needed for integrating WBS as a supplemental data source.

“Question marks still exist on the actionability of wastewater data for multiple pathogens, and overall, resources for public health surveillance are scarce in many countries, including Finland,” she said.

Koopmans, who considers herself a “fan” of WBS, agreed that “learning to work with this type of data” and the “need for target validation” could “put the brakes” on WBS development.

Nevertheless, she stressed that WBS can be especially useful for pathogens that often “go under the radar” like polio. WBS might also help with locating mpox Clade Ib viruses, which have started to spread outside Africa.

The European Commission has made significant investments in WBS and provides funding opportunities to member states, Daniel Palm, head of microbiology and bioinformatics at the ECDC, told Medscape News Europe. “The ongoing Joint Action EU-WISH brings together 25 member states and Ukraine to develop and strengthen wastewater surveillance systems at the national level,” he said.

“Establishing a network for sharing best practices and expertise, along with additional laboratory support activities such as external quality assessments, reference services, and training, will help ensure effective implementation, harmonization of methodologies, and robust data interpretation,” he concluded.

In children and adolescents with probable peanut allergy, exposure to peanuts in the air — by having an open bag of peanuts held under their nose — typically did not lead to allergic reactions or any need for medical treatment.

“The pragmatic and safe challenge protocol we employed may serve as a valuable tool in clinical practice, especially in counselling patients and families concerned about airborne peanut exposure,” the authors of the study wrote.

Håvard Trønnes, MD, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway, was the corresponding author of the study, which was published online on December 11 in the International Archives of Allergy and Immunology.

None of the participants had a peanut allergy confirmed by a double‑blind, placebo‑controlled food challenge, and some participants may have developed tolerance to the allergen before the challenge. The controlled 10-minute challenge may not reflect airborne exposures in the real world.

Some of the researchers reported having financial ties to companies, including Nestlé, Ferring, ALK, Sanofi, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and MSD.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended amivantamab (Rybrevant) plus lazertinib (Lazcluze) as a first-line option for adults with previously untreated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harbouring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations. 

In final draft guidance, NICE said the combination therapy should be funded by the NHS in England for eligible patients when it is the most appropriate option. Around 1115 people are expected to benefit.

Lung cancer is the third most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer mortality in the UK. It accounted for 10% of all new cancer diagnoses and 20% of cancer deaths in 2020. Approximately 31,000 people received NSCLC diagnoses in England in 2021, comprising 91% of all lung cancer cases. EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC is more common in women, non-smokers, and individuals from Asian ethnic backgrounds.

Welcoming the decision, Virginia Harrison, research trustee, EGFR+ UK, said, “This is a meaningful advance for patients and their families facing this diagnosis. [It] provides something the EGFR community urgently needs: more choice in first-line treatment.”

The recommendation adds an alternative to existing standards, including osimertinib monotherapy or osimertinib plus pemetrexed/platinum-based chemotherapy. Clinical specialists noted that no single standard care exists for this patient group.

Younger patients and those willing to accept greater side effects may choose between amivantamab plus lazertinib or osimertinib plus chemotherapy. Patients older than 80 years might prefer osimertinib monotherapy due to adverse event considerations.

Amivantamab is a bispecific antibody that simultaneously binds EGFR and mesenchymal-epithelial transition receptors, blocking downstream signalling pathways that drive tumour growth and promoting immune-mediated cancer cell killing. Lazertinib is an oral third-generation EGFR TKI that selectively inhibits mutant EGFR signalling. Together, the agents provides complementary suppression of EGFR-driven tumour growth and resistance mechanisms.

The NICE recommendation is supported by results from the phase 3 MARIPOSA trial, which met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS). Treatment with amivantamab plus lazertinib significantly prolonged median PFS to 23.7 months compared with 16.6 months with osimertinib. The combination also demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival, reducing the risk for death by 25% vs osimertinib. Median OS was not reached in the combination arm and was 36.7 months with osimertinib.

The most common adverse reactions with the combination included rash, nail toxicity, hypoalbuminaemia, hepatotoxicity, and stomatitis. 

A Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency-approved subcutaneous  formulation of amivantamab, authorised after the committee's initial meeting, may further improve tolerability and convenience. Administration-related reactions occurred in 63% of patients with the intravenous formulation vs 14% with the subcutaneous formulation. Clinicians expect subcutaneous dosing to replace intravenous use in practice.

Amivantamab is administered every 2 weeks, either intravenously or subcutaneously. Lazertinib is taken as a daily oral tablet. 

Rybrevant costs £1079 for a 350-mg per 7-mL vial. Lazcluze is priced at £4128.50 for 56 x 80-mg tablets and £6192.75 for 28 x 240-mg tablets. Confidential NHS discounts are available through simple patient access schemes.

Integrated care boards, NHS England, and local authorities must implement the guidance within 90 days of publication. For drugs receiving positive draft recommendations for routine commissioning, interim funding becomes accessible from the Cancer Drugs Fund budget starting from the point of marketing authorisation or publication of draft guidance.

Eric Chelle and Wilfred Ndidi speak ahead of Nigeria's Africa Cup of Nations clash against Tanzania. (1:02)

Stung by their failure to qualify for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, Victor Osimhen said Nigeria are determined to use the Africa Cup of Nations to channel their disappointment into tournament success in Morocco.

After failing to qualify directly, Nigeria were handed a lifeline via the playoff route, but after making light work of Gabon in the semifinal found themselves bested by Congo DR on penalties in the final, and their World Cup dreams go up in smoke.

""For us, last month was really disappointing,"" Osimhen said during a team media availability Monday in reference to the loss against Congo DR. ""It is not how we thought it would be, but life has happened and I think we have moved on, but the painful memory still lingers so we want to use this opportunity to send a clear message out there that we still have it in us.""

The Galatasaray striker, who is expected to spearhead Nigeria's attack as they take on Tanzania in their opening group game on Tuesday, acknowledged that mistakes had been made, but that the tournament is a chance for the team to right those wrongs

""We had some shortcomings in the previous games, but this AFCON is a very big opportunity for us to rectify some things,"" said the forward. ""For our own selves also, not just for the fans. We will give everything to make sure we actualize this dream.

""We want to use this opportunity of coming to AFCON to try to make up for so many disappointments that we have given them and use everything we have to make them happy.

""For us, now we are going to war and Tuesday is the first one and we will give everything.""

Uganda, along with Tunisia, who eliminated the Super Eagles from the 2021 tournament in the round of 16 are the other teams in Group C with Nigeria and Tanzania.

Osimhen said he is positive about the Super Eagles chances of progress, and rates them, along with hosts Morocco, among the favourites to win the tournament

""Aside from Nigeria, I think the hosts are favourites,"" he said. ""They have a lot of quality and I also look at some other countries but this is Africa and you can't tell because anybody can shock you. Just like us and the hosts, there are other favourites also, but I tip Nigeria Super Eagles to go all the way.

""We are not underrating anyone in our group, but we are up there with so many favourites in this tournament. It is not going to be easy and we have a long way to go but I think I'm positive about the squad.""

Nigeria will be without former team captain William Troost-Ekong, who was voted MVP at the last AFCON in Ivory Coast, after he announced his international retirement just before the final list was released.

Osimhen was widely touted as a replacement, but the armband eventually went to former Leicester City midfielder Wilfred Ndidi and the striker had no issues backing the choice

""Wilfred was one of the leaders in the team even when Troost-Ekong was captain. He has also learned a lot from him because Ekong was one of the best captains I have known since I arrived here alongside [John Obi] Mikel and [Ahmed] Musa.

""For me, I am happy he was given the captaincy. It is just for all of us to support him. Every one of us will support him because he is a good person on and off the pitch. Even on the pitch he gives his all, so he deserves it and we will all rally round to help him.""

Beyond backing the captain, Osimhen is also throwing his weight behind coach Eric Chelle, who is facing pressure to deliver, and has been given a mandate to reach the AFCON final by the Nigerian federation.

""The coach has been doing an amazing job,"" Osimhen added. ""Training has been really intense. For me I believe so much in this squad. I believe so much in the coach and everyone associated with this team.""

He has support from fellow forward Ademola Lookman, who says Nigeria can build on their second place finish from the last tournament.

""Last time we came so close but didn't win,"" said the Atalanta forward. ""Keeping that togetherness, that unity we have in this squad is important to keep us going. Obviously, we have to show quality in our games, show togetherness and fight. We have that. If it all comes together, we will be great.""

Lookman agreed with Osimhen that the Super Eagles can turn their World Cup disappointment inti motivation

""Obviously, that was disappointing for all of us, we know that we bear that also,"" Lookman said. ""Hopefully we can use that pain into something positive and turn it into something powerful to drive us.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Santos and Brazil star Neymar has undergone knee surgery following the end of the season. The forward helped save Santos from relegation, despite struggling with a knee issue in the final weeks of the campaign, but has now gone under the knife. Santos have offered an update on his condition and an update on when he is expected to be fit again has been provided.

Neymar has been blighted by injury issues in recent years and has undergone another operation after suffering knee problems during his time back at Santos. The Brazil star has undergone an arthroscopy which is not expected to sideline him for too long, meaning his World Cup dreams remain alive. Neymar played through the pain barrier in the final weeks of the season but did help Santos avoid relegation after promotion last year. The Brazilian superstar returned to Santos in January, after a dismal time in Saudi Arabia with Al-Hilal, and played a key role in keeping the team up. ""I came for this, to try to help the best way I can. These have been tough weeks for me,"" Neymar said after his team beat the drop. ""I thank those who were with me to lift me up. If it weren't for them, I wouldn't have played these matches because of these injuries, this knee problem. I need to rest and then we will have this knee surgery.""

Santos have now confirmed Neymar has undergone successful surgery: ""The player Neymar da Silva Santos Junior underwent surgery this Monday morning (12/22) at Mater Dei Nova Lima by Dr. Rodrigo Lasmar and his team. An arthroscopy was performed to treat a lesion in the medial meniscus. The surgery was a success and the athlete is doing well. Neymar Jr. will be discharged early this afternoon and will begin his rehabilitation process, which will be coordinated by his physiotherapist Rafael Martini.""

Neymar is expected to miss around a month of action, meaning he is due back at the end of January/early February, according to ESPN. The timeline means that Neymar could potentially be available for the derby against Corinthians in the Campeonato Paulista on January 22nd. Before that game, Santos are due to face Novorizontino, Palmeiras and Guarani. 

Neymar's contract at the club is due to expire at the end of the month but it is expected he will stay and sign an extension through to the 2026 World Cup. Santos president Marcelo Teixeira has told ESPN he expects Neymar to continue: ""Neymar's project is a project for next year's World Cup. The conversation has always been this. He could go anywhere and wanted to come to Santos, his home. Maybe we imagined taking advantage of it more in the first half of the year and we couldn't, but it's nobody's fault. He ends the season in a better way, he was decisive. Neymar's participation continues to be important, off the field and on it. The dialogue remains. We are evaluating the numbers and extending these values. I have a positive expectation that we will reach a common denominator for his permanence.""

Neymar will now be hoping to make a full and swift recovery from his knee problem and return to playing football. The Brazilian has readily admitted he dreams of playing at World Cup 2026 but still has work to do to convince manager Carlo Ancelotti he deserves a place in his squad. He told reporters earlier this month: ""If we talk about Neymar, we have to talk about other players. We have to think about Brazil, which can be with Neymar or without Neymar, with other players or without other players. The definitive list we will make after the FIFA date in March. I understand very well that they are very interested in Neymar, I want to clarify that we are in December, the World Cup is in June, I will choose the team that will go to the World Cup in May. If Neymar deserves to be, if he is well, better than someone else, he will play in the World Cup and period. I don't owe anyone a debt.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

""The level at which she takes control over a lot of different aspects but also allowing people to be experts in their own right, I think that a lot of that stuff is fun to watch,"" he said.

Jason Kelce protects the family. In a new interview with the Wall Street Journal published Monday (Dec. 22) about his investment in the hot sauce brand Hank Sauce, the former NFL center and current Monday Night Football commentator as well as New Heights cohost says he doesn't really talk business with his very famous sister-in-law-to-be, Taylor Swift, who is marrying his brother, Travis Kelce.

	











	“We've tried to keep a lot of that out of the relationship. I just enjoy her being my brother's soon-to-be wife, and aunt to my kids, and we try to leave that relationship where it should be, there,” he says. (And indeed, cameras caught Swift in aunt mode at a recent Kansas City Chiefs game with Jason's daughters – he and wife Kylie Kelce are parents to Wyatt, 6, Elliotte, 4, Bennett, 2, and Finnley, 8 months.)


	That doesn't mean he doesn't hold her up as an example. “Watching her operate, watching her savviness in getting her entire music catalogue back, watching how she has toured the globe while also writing an entire new album, the level at which she takes control over a lot of different aspects but also allowing people to be experts in their own right, I think that a lot of that stuff is fun to watch,” he explains.


	As for the upcoming wedding, Kelce says he's a different kind of guest now. “I've evolved quite greatly since getting married myself. Early on, I went to a wedding with just a Target graphic T-shirt. I've taken my shirts off at weddings,” he says.

	











	But he might make an exception for his brother's nuptials. “Listen, the first time I met Taylor was at a Buffalo Bills game. I jumped out of a suite. She invites us back to things now!” he recalled. “We'll see if the shirt stays on or off. I think if my shirt comes off, Kylie will be very upset about that.”

Senior Film Reporter


Claes Bang (The Square), Matthew Needham (Napoleon), Golden Globe winner and Emmy nominee Ving Rhames (Mission: Impossible franchise), and Joshua Orpin (Titans) are new additions to the cast of Painter, the 20th action film directed by veteran stunt coordinator Garrett Warren, which has wrapped production in Serbia and has now been confirmed for release on Hulu at a date not yet disclosed.


	As previously announced, Amber Midthunder, Walton Goggins, Florian Munteanu, and Daniel Bernhardt also star.


	In the film penned by the John Wick franchise's Derek Kolstad, Midthunder plays the title character, Painter, who while being raised in the unforgiving hills of Appalachia, was molded by her adoptive father into a survivor — tough, cunning and relentless. When he's kidnapped, she's thrust from her mountain home into a high-stakes world of international espionage, where the clock is ticking and saving him will take every ruthless skill she has ever learned.

Spoiler Space offers thoughts on, and a place to discuss, the plot points we can't disclose in our official review. Fair warning: This article features plot details of Avatar: Fire And Ash.

There's a shot in Avatar: Fire And Ash, director James Cameron's third holiday in Pandora in 16 years, that could qualify as an Easter egg. As one of the few remaining scientists on the planet who are still purely human, Dr. Norm Spellman (Joel David Moore), springs into action, the camera follows him into a beat-up tanning bed-like device. It lingers on the device as if to ask the audience, “Remember when these movies were about these things?” The “link unit” once connected the paraplegic marine Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) to his avatar body, and it was as integral to the first film as 3D glasses. As has been true in much of Cameron's sci-fi work, the technology in Avatar was the key to human survival and evolution. However, since that first movie, Cameron has allowed the tech to recede into the background. With Fire And Ash, change comes from within.

When Avatar debuted in December 2009, Cameron hyped his groundbreaking digital effects as a sea change for the motion picture industry. He baked his vision of a techno-utopia into the script, which heralded a consciousness-altering device that could give people new lives, bodies, and perspectives. Like Dorothy stepping into Technicolor, Cameron pitched Jake Sully's experience on Pandora as a stand-in for that of the audience, offering a new level of immersion through the director's use of state-of-the-art 3D. The debate over whether he succeeded has raged for more than a decade, but the director has moved on, and he has since inverted, subverted, and upended the idea that technology was the answer to humanity's problems. Lately, he seems less convinced than ever.

Cameron's interest in technology has always been two-fold. Since The Terminator, he's been at the forefront of visual effects, using them to tell grand stories of grander emotions. His characters often grapple with their relationship to technology and typically need to make peace with it before silencing an existential threat against the family. Aliens‘ Ripley must pilot a new mechanized body, the Powerloader, to defeat the Alien queen. In Terminator 2, a rebuttal to Cameron's own fatalistic cyberpunk original, Sarah (Linda Hamilton) and John Connor (Edward Furlong) must form a nuclear family with her former predator, the T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger), to properly dispose of the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) and prevent a war with the machines. As if to put a point on his shifting attitudes, by the end of Avatar, a Na'vi, Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña), kills Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), the series' sneering avatar of colonialism, decked out in a mech suit seemingly pillaged from Weaver's old trailer.

By 2022's Avatar: The Way Of Water, Cameron had further deemphasized the importance of tech on Pandora, focusing closer on the spiritual connection to his digital world. The avatar bodies are basically gone, replaced by hybrids of the natural and artificial. Jake Sully's five-fingered children, the offspring of a natural Na'vi and an avatar body, become the focus, along with Kiri (Weaver), the immaculately conceived child of Dr. Grace's (also Weaver) avatar. The late Colonel Quaritch, too, gets a transhumanist resurrection, with his memories permanently uploaded to an avatar he can't escape. Most tellingly, the number of human characters is greatly reduced, mostly narrowing down to Quaritch's son, Spider (Jack Champion), the boy raised by Na'vi—effectively, Cameron's very own Mowgli.

In Fire And Ash, Cameron leaves the high-tech focus further behind, and goes even harder on both the spiritual and the human themes. Spider is the film's MacGuffin, with his oxygen mask providing much of the first act's tension. The film revolves around whether he'll be welcomed into the Sully familial fortress, but first, he needs to learn how to breathe on Pandora. When his oxygen mask runs out of battery, technology can't save him; only Kiri's new powers can do that. Through a mix of prayer and botany, Kiri raises magical weeds from the forest floor, which enter Spider's mouth and plant an endosymbiont deep inside his lungs. The nature of Pandora and the biology of humanity work together, giving him the ability to breathe again—as well as one of those magic dreadlocks that allows Spider to plug into Pandora's flora and fauna. It's this internal transformation that becomes the new unobtanium for the plot: If Quaritch gets to Spider first, and shows this scientific discovery to the military, it could be put to sinister use, supercharging humanity's colonization efforts.

As Cameron devotes the rest of his natural life to these movies—one must assume there will be some Cameron-Bot making films long after he's passed—he continues to indulge his cornier side as he's aged. And this is the guy who ended Terminator 2 with, “I know now why you cry, but it is something I can never do.” With the Avatar movies, he's added a spirituality that matches his crunchier beliefs, doing so through these CGI wonders. By deemphasizing the in-universe technology, Cameron removes the need for an audience surrogate who puts on his own 3D glasses. He doesn't want the audience to think about jacking in and out of different bodies; he simply wants us to experience Pandora. Hence, in Fire And Ash, the idea of Na'vi getting a hold of advanced human weaponry becomes an existential threat, while the Sully kids seek help at the bottom of the ocean—a place Cameron has spent more time than almost any other person.

Cameron refutes his earlier films with these latest Avatar sequels, seeming less and less convinced by technology's ability to bring people together. He wants Pandora and its films to be a unifier, a communal experience, one that's welcoming to all people. He literalizes that with Spider—a human who's literally becoming Na'vi on the inside—and by the end of Fire And Ash, he's welcomed into the Na'vi's spirit world not through technology, but his natural and spiritual evolution. It's an arc that represents a full-circle moment for the filmmaker. “Because if a machine, a Terminator, can learn the value of human life,” Sarah Connor narrates at the end of Terminator 2, “maybe we can, too.” For all his incredible CGI, Cameron is finally investing in humanity first and foremost.

The Indie Game Awards, hosted by Six One Indie, were held on December 18, with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 winning Best Debut Game and Indie Game of the Year. Two days later, it was disqualified from eligibility. Its awards were withdrawn and awarded to runners-up due to revelations about the game's usage of generative AI.

Sandfall Interactive's indie status has already been put into question by many, owing to its AAA prestige and team size in a field where many independent games are made by under 10 people, but it qualified for the IGA's awards until its use of generative AI was revealed. Screenshots close to launch in April showed a pillar covered in posters with generated text and images, which were quietly patched out shortly after release. Unlike The Alters, which used gen AI for both placeholders and some subtitles, Clair Obscur went under the radar with its usage, despite disclosing that they used “some, not much” gen AI when speaking to Spanish periodical El País in July.

The IGA made a staunch commitment against any gen AI usage in its nominees, stipulating that “games developed using generative AI are strictly ineligible for nomination” in their eligibility FAQ. In a statement posted on their social media, Six One Indie's creative director Mike Towndrow said “despite agreeing that no gen AI was used in the making of the game when it was submitted to us for consideration, unfortunately that's not the case. That clearly goes against the regulations we have in place and disqualifies it from nomination.”

With Clair Obscur disqualified, the IGA award for Debut Game now goes to Sorry We're Closed and the Indie Game of the Year is now Blue Prince. Although Sorry was released in 2024, it was still within the eligibility window. The new winners have been contacted and will provide acceptance speeches when feasible.

Towndrow went on to disqualify one of their Indie Vanguards, Gorytn Code, as their game Chantey is being distributed and produced solely by ModRetro, founded by arms dealer Palmer Luckey. ModRetro had made headlines prior in the week after unveiling the Anduril edition of their Chromatic handheld, made with metal also used in Luckey's attack drones of the same name as a selling point. With this going “strictly against the values” of the show, their status was also revoked.

In an update to the El País article, Sandfall asserted that although the AI generated placeholder accidentally shipped in the final game, it was a product of “brief” experimentation with the new technology in 2022 and that currently “there are no generative AI-created assets” in Clair Obscur.

Turner Classic Movies (TCM) is set to honor the life and career of beloved late filmmaker Rob Reiner with a newly-announced programming tribute next month. On January 28, 2026, the network will host a full evening of Reiner's work, including four of his most popular films, headlined by a special premiere presentation of “The Princess Bride,” which has not been previously available on the network.

Reiner and his wife, photographer and producer Michele Singer Reiner, passed away on December 14 and, in the days since, the outpouring of love for the pair and their work has been profound.

 










Per a press release about the event, “‘The Princess Bride' endures as one of Reiner's most beloved achievements — celebrated for its wit, emotional sincerity, and timeless storytelling that continues to resonate with audiences across generations. A longtime friend of TCM and a passionate advocate of film preservation, Reiner was one of the most accomplished and versatile filmmakers of his generation.”

Added TCM host Ben Mankiewicz in his own statement, “With ‘This Is Spinal Tap' Rob began an extraordinary 11-year run that rivals the finest directors in Hollywood history: He made ‘The Sure Thing,' ‘Stand by Me,' ‘The Princess Bride,' ‘When Harry Met Sally,' ‘Misery,' ‘A Few Good Men,' and ‘The American President.' The profound sense of loss we're all feeling is heightened by Rob's lofty standing in Hollywood, he was universally loved inside the entertainment industry. I did not know him as well as I would have liked, but he always made me feel like we had been pals for decades. Rob's character was defined by the qualities we see in those films: kindness, decency, humor, compassion, and most of all, a belief in humanity.” 

The evening will kick off at 8 p.m. on Wednesday, January 28, 2026 with the TCM network premiere of “The Princess Bride,” followed by “When Harry Met Sally” at 10 p.m., “Stand by Me” at 12 a.m., and ending with “This Is Spinal Tap” at 1:45 a.m.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Psychic","Psychic Tip Spurs New Lead In Chicago Hit‑And‑Run Probe","https://hoodline.com/2025/12/psychic-tip-sends-south-side-son-back-to-fatal-corner-in-hunt-for-hit-and-run-driver/","Mon, 22 Dec 2025 18:41:14 GMT","

A psychic's unsolicited tip yanked a Chicago man back to the Marquette Park blocks he thought he had already searched to death, and it delivered a clue that shook loose a long-stalled hit-and-run investigation. Damion Martin says the message told him to look for a blue-and-yellow sign, a detail that led him to surveillance footage that a witness later identified as showing the car that struck his mother. The crash that killed 54-year-old Tanja Safforld happened at about 5:56 p.m. on Nov. 20, 2024, near 67th (Marquette) and Western, and no one has been arrested.

Martin says he posted about his search on social media, which prompted an eyewitness to reach out. The two met up and combed through surveillance video from a used-car lot, where the witness pointed to a gray four-door sedan. That discovery led police to release a new photo of the vehicle. The break came after months of dead ends and after the tip about the blue-and-yellow sign, according to CBS Chicago. Martin and his relatives say they are still pressing for answers even as the investigation drags.

Chicago police say the collision happened just before 6 p.m. on Nov. 20, 2024, and that Safforld was taken to a hospital and later pronounced dead. Authorities issued a community alert, then released photos of a vehicle believed to be involved, and police asked anyone with information to call 312-745-4521 or submit an anonymous tip at CPDTIP.com using reference JH515431, as reported by ABC7 Chicago. Family members have set up a memorial near the crash site and say they will not stop searching for justice.

Video and eyewitness accounts are often the only way to connect a hit-and-run crash to a specific vehicle, and those tools tend to be scarce in the very places where the worst crashes happen. Streetsblog Chicago lists Safforld among dozens of people killed while walking on city streets in 2024, and the Governors Highway Safety Association reports that about one in four pedestrian deaths nationwide involves a driver who took off from the scene, according to GHSA.

Case records show the Major Accidents Investigation Unit detective photographed the crash scene and pulled video from nearby businesses, logging 39 hours on the case in November, another 49 hours in December, and 130 hours by February. Still, on March 2, 2025, the case was suspended. Documents also show that a license-plate reader was offline the night of the crash and that a Police Observation Device camera kept glitching, making some of the footage unusable, details reported by CBS Chicago. “We would have been getting justice,” Martin said, “because maybe, maybe the guy that did it would have turned himself in.”

Martin and his family keep up a memorial near the intersection and release balloons to mark the anniversary of Safforld's death, all while continuing to plead for witnesses to step forward. Police again asked anyone with information to call 312-745-4521 or send an anonymous tip through CPDTIP.com using reference JH515431, as reported by ABC7 Chicago.

      Thank you to everyone who read my recent article “Barriers to Disclosure: A summary of military insiders' claims about NHIs”, especially those of you who also posted comments. The discussion below the article was intelligent and very interesting to read.
    


      If the military insiders' claims about NHIs are accurate, this raises a number of further issues that have major long-term implications for mankind. The subject involves many of the points made by commenters responding to my previous article, along with other questions that commenters on these subs are continuing to raise. I'll list the main issues that come to mind below, in two overlapping sections:
    


Dangerous humans in a dangerous galaxy



1. The “red line” for a hostile NHI reaction: One can argue that “Humans haven't already been wiped out, so the NHIs' agenda obviously doesn't involve killing all of us.” However, a logical response to that statement is “Not yet.” The reason it may not have happened so far could be that we haven't been regarded as a threat, especially if the priority for the dominant aliens is power and territorial control rather than outright genocide. In other words, mankind's civilisation and/or technological capabilities may need to cross a perceived “red line” before it triggers a detectable and confirmed NHI reaction that humans would interpret as hostile.
    


2. Historical analogy: An analogy I've previously made is that Earth may be the equivalent of an isolated Stone Age village 2000 years ago whose backward, violent and arrogant inhabitants have grand plans to explore and colonise the rest of the world, but they have no idea they're actually within the multicontinental Roman Empire. There's no way the villagers could conceivably pose a military threat to the Roman legions. But the villagers would definitely be regarded as problematic if they're potentially about to figure out how to reach neighbouring villages within Roman territory and thereby risk destabilising the local region, especially if they've also somehow acquired or developed Bronze Age weaponry.
    


3. Mankind as a future regional threat: Similarly, the main issue is that humans are not necessarily a threat to the dominant NHIs directly (especially if there's a massive power imbalance between them and humans, as the military insiders have claimed), but we're definitely a future threat to any of our interstellar neighbours who may be less developed (or less violent) than humans and whose planets are within the territory controlled by the dominant NHIs. If the latter are not benevolent themselves, of course, they would also have more self-serving reasons to identify and neutralise potential threats to their dominance, or at least threats to the stability of galactic regions they claim as their own.
    


4. Mankind's tendency for extreme violence: As discussed in the previous article, apparently the main issue is the human tendency for violence and the danger we therefore pose if we manage to figure out interstellar travel and begin turning up in neighbouring star systems as the equivalent of “intelligent, inquisitive, territorial, violent gorillas who have obtained shotguns and have escaped from their enclosure”.
    


5. AI, Quantum Computing, UAP reverse-engineering and human interstellar travel: This may be another reason for the apparent increase in NHI activity and UAP sightings, because the timing is very interesting: It may be a pre-emptive action due to NHIs predicting that mankind's rapidly-accelerating AI and Quantum Computers will achieve a huge technological research breakthrough in the near future. Perhaps it involves humans becoming capable of interstellar travel much sooner than we expect. This may be related to Grusch's claim that Lockheed Martin has had an intact UAP for decades but wants to divest itself of the material because the level of extreme secrecy and compartmentalisation has prevented the company from being able to bring in the right engineers to properly study the craft. Given that the processing and problem-solving capabilities of some Quantum Computers in particular are already much greater than the world's fastest “normal” supercomputers, it's possible that advances in this specific area of computer technology will finally facilitate the successful reverse-engineering of UAPs.
    


6. Other UAP/NHI-related consequences of AI and Quantum Computing: Impending near-future major advances in humanity's computer technology that could explain the increase in UAP and NHI activity may also involve a significant increase in our ability to detect UAPs and NHIs, or a major increase in our military capabilities, or a breakthrough in long-distance/interstellar communication capabilities.
    


7. It's not necessarily a “Dark Forest scenario” in the literal sense: We're not going to be wiped out just for existing as a sentient species; if this was the case then it would obviously already have happened. However, what seems to be a current escalation (and any future NHI military activity) may well be a reaction to perceived future strategic threats to the dominant aliens' authority and territorial control.
    


8. Hierarchy of “apex/alpha predator” species: It's not surprising that NHIs may be investigating and targeting potential threats, since several military insiders have also claimed that the universe is dominated by a hierarchy of “apex/alpha predator” species. This is probably also what one of these individuals was referring to when he recommended the Three Body Problem as one of the best sci-fi sources for people trying to figure out the real-life situation. While it doesn't mean the stars are full of genocidal armed hunters who shoot first, it does strongly imply that the galaxy is much more dangerous for humans than we may realise. Something for us all to think about the next time we look up at the night sky.
    


Out of the frying pan, into the fire?



9. NHI surveillance and mankind's strategic vulnerabilities: Human civilisation's own flaws and weaknesses complicate the situation further. NHIs who have thoroughly researched human history and patterns of behaviour will also be aware of this, especially if they've been monitoring our planet for thousands or even millions of years. It would therefore be very easy for NHIs to exploit mankind's strategic vulnerabilities (both before and after Disclosure) and manipulate them for their own advantage.
    


10. NHIs and Earth's geopolitics: “Divide and rule” is a very old strategy, and unfortunately it's horribly effective against human psychology. Is this what has been happening? Are the present-day escalating geopolitical issues on Earth purely due to humanity's own psychological and societal flaws? Or are they also due to NHIs deliberately sabotaging and destabilising human civilisation so that we remain divided and hamstrung by our petty internal squabbles? It's difficult to tell. Mankind is perfectly capable of global self-sabotage all by itself; we certainly don't need any external assistance for our species to cause all manner of problems for ourselves. However, consider this hypothetical scenario: If our solar system is actually within the territory of an NHI interstellar superpower and the dominant NHIs have been encouraging major problems on our planet in order to keep humans permanently confined to our solar system as a “quarantined enclosure”, would the situation here today really look any different? Either way, a weak and divided mankind makes it much easier for the dominant NHIs to neutralise any perceived long-term threat from humans. Suffice to say that the current state of our world may suit the NHIs perfectly fine.
    


11. Traits of dominant biological NHI species: In any case, it is naive and possibly catastrophically irresponsible for humans to automatically assume benevolence on the part of NHIs that may be vastly more powerful than humans and also have literally alien psychology. The most intelligent species on Earth are all group-based apex/alpha predators, unfortunately warfare accelerates technological capabilities, and it is likely that the most successful and dominant biological NHI species will also have this heritage. They will occupy that position of dominance because of characteristics that have enabled them to out-think and out-fight everyone else.
    


12. Gulf in psychology: Human and NHI perspectives: As discussed in the previous article, military insiders have claimed that there is a gulf between human psychology and the psychology of the dominant NHIs, so the lack of psychological common ground means that humans are effectively alone in the universe. The wider context of the statements explains that this specifically refers to the difficult questions it raises with regards to understanding the NHIs' perspectives, especially their motives and intentions towards us. Notwithstanding alleged hybrids, it means that the real-life NHIs are significantly more alien psychologically than the way that they have often been represented in sci-fi. It's not a “Star Trek” universe out there.
    


13. Gulf in psychology: Complications with human-NHI interaction: If we really are quarantined inside our solar system, it would also mean that humans are isolated in the literal sense. A less extreme implication is that differences in psychology would create problems in effective two-way communication as well as mutual comprehension, not to mention mutual empathy, although we obviously have examples on Earth where humans have successfully overcome this when interacting with other group-based predators (eg. wolves/dogs). However, in terms of strategic threat assessment and basic common sense, the most prudent course of action for humans would be to exercise great caution with anything involving the dominant NHIs until we have a much greater (and accurate) understanding of the full picture. This is particularly important since the situation currently involves a much more powerful external force that is of unknown origin and has unknown motives and intentions.
    


14. NHI motivations, ethics and psychological drivers: The claim that NHIs would not be malevolent by human standards because a post-scarcity interstellar civilisation will have outgrown any resource requirements or cultural factors driving such behaviour is misguided, because it assumes that the NHIs have purely utilitarian motivations. For all we know, they could be involved in any number of malevolent activities simply because they enjoy it and/or find it interesting, not because they have any practical need for it. Or because ethics as we understand the concept aren't even a factor in their psychology and they're motivated by entirely different rationales. In fact, the NHIs could have psychological drivers based on their specific biological background or civilisational structure that humans would find utterly alien and incomprehensible. The psychological gulf could be even greater with regards to sentient AI NHIs.
    


15. Technological advancement and territorial dominance: As a species, humans certainly have a lot of positive traits. Unfortunately, global history and present-day geopolitics show that mankind has a lot of negative traits too. So humans are definitely a risk to the rest of the galaxy in that sense. However, we should absolutely not assume that more technologically advanced NHIs are any better than us; in fact, they may be worse, especially if they've been able to successfully dominate huge areas of galactic territory for a very long time and neutralise or eliminate any threats to their position.
    


16. Dominant NHI interstellar civilisations, galactic geopolitics and mankind's future: It's not necessarily the most ethical NHIs that will be the dominant interstellar civilisations in the galaxy, but the most intelligent, the most technologically advanced, the most heavily-armed, and potentially the most ruthless and/or machiavellian. If they also happen to be reasonably benevolent (at least towards humans) by human standards, that's a bonus; but we should never take that possibility for granted. Especially if the dominant NHIs would actually interpret any future attempts at human deep space travel outside the boundaries of our solar system as “barbarians at the gates” or, even worse, rampaging gorillas that would have to be culled.

NEW YORK, December 22. /TASS/. The administration of US President Donald Trump has decided to recall a number of career diplomats holding senior positions from nearly 30 foreign missions, the Associated Press news agency reported, citing unnamed State Department officials.

According to its information, the heads of 29 US missions abroad have been notified that their terms in their current positions will expire in January.

The news agency noted that these diplomats took up their posts under the administration of the 46th US President Joe Biden. The largest number of ambassadors are being recalled from Africa, where heads of US diplomatic missions in 13 countries have received termination notices. In Asia, the Trump administration is recalling ambassadors from six countries, including Vietnam and the Philippines.

In the Middle East, high-ranking American diplomats in Algeria and Egypt have also received termination notices. These personnel changes will also affect US embassies in Armenia, North Macedonia, Montenegro, and Slovakia. According to the Associated Press, the recalled diplomats will have to return to Washington, where they may receive new appointments if they wish.

On July 11, the news agency reported that the State Department had begun mass layoffs, involving the reduction of 1,300 employees. These layoffs are part of Secretary of State Marco Rubio's plan to reorganize the department, aiming to save money and make ideological adjustments.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Ukrainian partisans set ablaze two Russian Su-30 fighter jets during an operation on the night of Dec. 21 in Russia's Lipetsk Oblast, Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) said on Dec. 22.

The attack targeted an airfield near the city of Lipetsk, about 340 kilometers (210 miles) from the Ukrainian border, and caused two military aircraft to catch fire.

HUR originally reported an Su-30 and an Su-27 had been damaged in the attack, but later clarified it was two Su-30s.

The operation succeeded after a careful study of patrol routes and guard schedules, which enabled the operative to slip into the military facility, attack Russian fighter jets in the hangar, and exit the airfield undetected.

Planning for the operation took two weeks, and it was carried out by a ""representative of the resistance movement"" against the Russian government, according to HUR.

HUR estimated the value of the disabled aircraft to be up to $100 million.

The Su-27 is a Russian twin-engine fighter jet designed for air superiority, while the Su-30 is a two-seat, multirole variant with longer range and upgraded avionics for air-to-air and air-to-ground missions.

Russia uses these fighter jets over Ukraine mainly for air patrols, intercepting Ukrainian aircraft, and supporting deadly strikes against the neighboring country.

Ukraine routinely carries out operations in Russian-occupied territories and inside Russia to weaken Russian military capabilities.

Ukrainian drones struck two Russian Su-27 fighter jets on Dec. 20 at the Belbek military airfield in Russian-occupied Crimea. 

The strike adds to Ukraine's toll on Russian air power, with a total of 432 aircraft reportedly destroyed since the full-scale invasion began in 2022, according to Ukraine's General Staff.

Kateryna covered the 2022 Olympics in Beijing and was included in the Special Mentions list at the AIPS Sport Media Awards. She holds a bachelor's degree in political journalism from Taras Shevchenko University and a master's degree in political science from the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy.





""In principle, the ammunition initiative has certainly been a good thing; the question is whether it has occurred without corruption,"" Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said.

‌‌‌Earlier this year, the Kyiv Independent launched its “How to Help Ukraine” newsletter — a membership benefit created in direct response to our community's requests for more ways to help Ukraine during Russia's full-scale invasion. ‌‌In the first six months since the newsletter's launch, our community has raised over $105,300, according to the organizations we featured. ‌‌



Drone debris hit a pipeline at a terminal in Volna, a village in the region's Temryuk district, the Krasnodar Krai Emergency Headquarters said. A fire broke out as a result of the attack. 

""I think that we've made progress, but sitting here today, I wouldn't say with confidence that we're going to get to a peaceful resolution,"" U.S. Vice President JD Vance said. 



The attack targeted an airfield near the city of Lipetsk, about 340 kilometers (210 miles) from the Ukrainian border, and caused two military aircraft to catch fire.

The Kremlin had earlier signaled it was preparing for Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev's arrival. 

According to preliminary information, on Dec. 18, Russian forces illegally detained about 50 civilians — residents of the village of Hrabovske — holding them without access to communication or adequate conditions. On Dec. 20, they were forcibly taken to Russia.

Russian LNG deliveries to China more than doubled year-on-year to 1.6 million metric tons last month, Bloomberg reported.

An explosive device attached to the underside of Lieutenant General Fanil Sarvarov's car detonated on Yaseneva Street in Moscow on Dec. 22. 

The talks focused on a revised 20-point plan to end Russia's war in Ukraine, a framework for security guarantees, and economic development, according to Rustem Umerov, the head of the Ukrainian delegation.

""If Putin says no, we need to dramatically change the game, including giving Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine to hit the drone and missile factories that exist in Russia. I would go all in if Putin says no,"" U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham said on Dec. 21. ","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Fox Chase Cancer Center's Dr. Randall Lee joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss why cancer diagnosis rates are on the rise, what contributes to the trend and the benefits of a post-Thanksgiving meal walk.

Barry Manilow revealed that doctors recently discovered a cancerous spot on his lung.

What started as lingering bronchitis turned into an unexpected medical discovery for Manilow, one he says was caught early thanks to a ""great doctor."" Manilow shared the health update with fans Monday on Instagram.

""As many of you know I recently went through six weeks of bronchitis followed by a relapse of another five weeks,"" Manilow wrote on Instagram. ""Even though I was over the bronchitis and back on stage at the Westgate Las Vegas, my wonderful doctor ordered an MRI just to make sure that everything was OK. The MRI discovered a cancerous spot on my left lung that needs to be removed. It's pure luck (and a great doctor) that it was found so early. That's the good news.""

""The bad news is that now that the Christmas A Gift of Love concerts are over I'm going into surgery to have the spot removed,"" he continued. ""The doctors do not believe it has spread and I'm taking tests to confirm the diagnosis. So, that's it. No chemo. No radiation. Just chicken soup and I Love Lucy reruns.""

Manilow does not have to endure chemotherapy or radiation, but will need time off to recover. He revealed his upcoming January shows have been rescheduled.

""The only follow-up is a month to recover and that means we have to reschedule the January arena concerts,"" Manilow wrote.

Michael Burry says Nvidia is pushing the idea that building graphics chips that consume more and more power is the best path to advancing AI — and the result could be the US losing the AI race to China.

""Exactly and sadly,"" Burry wrote on X late Saturday, responding to another user's comment that called Nvidia the ""gangster of the AI neighborhood"" as it has ""shut down any narrative that even hints at reducing GPU demand.""

In another post over the weekend, Burry shared a chart showing China has more than double America's electric generation capacity, and is expanding its energy infrastructure at a much faster rate.

Why China will win AI in one chart. Power hungry Nvidia chips are not the way forward for the U.S. It is not just the total power advantage. It is the slope. pic.twitter.com/qNXh1e4lZj

Nvidia has framed AI innovation as ""just figuring out how to power and to cool bigger, hotter silicon,"" Burry said. But China's huge lead in building out power sources means companies in the US are ""plowing capital into a race it is structurally positioned to lose.""

Burry said the US needs to shift its focus from developing more and more ""power hungry"" chips toward advancing ""AI-tuned ASICs"" — application-specific integrated circuits that are designed to do a particular task quickly and efficiently.

But he said Nvidia has a ""death grip on development"" thanks to its deals with many key players in the AI industry.

Nvidia did not immediately reply to a request for comment from Business Insider about Burry's posts.

Nvidia stock has surged more than 12-fold since the start of 2023, making it the world's most valuable public company, with a market capitalization of $4.4 trillion.

The chipmaker raked in about $148 billion of revenue and $77 billion of net income in the first nine months of this year. ""Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,"" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in the third-quarter earnings release.

Burry, whose contrarian bet against the US housing bubble was chronicled in the book and movie ""The Big Short,"" recently pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack.

He has made the case to his readers that Nvidia and other AI companies are inflating a historic tech bubble. He has said that Nvidia's customers have exaggerated the lifespan of its chips to drag out depreciation and boost short-term earnings.

Burry has also called out the ""give-and-take"" deals between Nvidia and chip buyers such as OpenAI and Oracle, and criticized Nvidia's stock-based compensation as excessive.

Nvidia previously responded to his critiques in a memo to Wall Street analysts that was quickly leaked. Burry fired back that the document featured ""one straw man after another"" and he stood by his analysis.

Replying to a subsequent comment on his Substack, Burry wrote that Nvidia had ""become too much of a focus."" While the company's response did make him ""think to look a little deeper,"" he said it was a ""relatively small short"" for him.

""I believe it will fall, and is a pure play on my overall thesis, but it is not the worst out there.""

While the GENIUS Act gave regulatory clarity to stablecoins, Coinbase is betting the law will push banks to adopt digital assets and related technology more broadly.   

""Post-GENIUS, bank board rooms are scrambling to get ready for what could be the biggest innovation for banks since electronic trading,"" Brett Tejpaul, co-CEO of Coinbase Institutional, told American Banker. Coinbase is ending the year by issuing a slew of new products and partnerships, including expanded collaborations with banks such as Standard Chartered, JPMorganChase and PNC to support digital asset development, and a deal with Swedish financial institution Klarna to raise funding in Coinbase's USDC stablecoin.   

""The idea of running finance on crypto rails as opposed to archaic tech is taking off,"" Tejpaul said. ""They're looking at their currency operations, things like Treasury bills that occupy most of their balance sheets and asking 'what if we run this in crypto rails? What would that look like?'""

Coinbase hopes banks will be attracted to its stablecoin rails and related digital asset services as a way to speed digital asset technology projects that improve transaction processing such as international B2B payments, treasury management and investments. For example, JPMorganChase recently made its JPM Coin deposit token, or JPMD, available for the bank's institutional clients on Base, a Coinbase-affiliated public blockchain.JPMD is not a stablecoin, and is in fact an alternative to stablecoins for banks that are worried about a potential stablecoin-driven drain on deposits and the dominance of fintechs among stablecoin issuers. 

""JPMorganChase for years had been on a private blockchain,"" Tejpaul said. ""Its move to a public blockchain is a major step toward the tokenization of all asset classes.""

Coinbase and Standard Chartered in late December expanded an existing partnership to include new crypto-related services for institutional clients, such as custody, staking, trade execution and security. In another move, Klarna said it would raise short-term funding denominated in Coinbase's USDC stablecoin. Klarna, which plans to issue its own stablecoin, said courting stablecoin investors would connect it to new sources of institutional investors and additional sources of funding. 

And in an earlier collaboration, Coinbase and PNC teamed to use Coinbase's ""crypto as a service"" platform to develop a service that enables the bank's clients to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies. Coinbase in recent days launched a menu of products designed to support digital assets or use enabling technology for other purposes. This includes extending stock trading to Coinbase users in the U.S., enabling users to invest in stocks using U.S. dollars or USDC, with stock trades existing alongside crypto portfolios. Other moves include making its business payments platform publicly available, and introducing Coinbase Advisor — an AI-powered tool that enables users to build portfolios on Coinbase with the guidance of AI agents. Coinbase is additionally building a protocol for agentic AI, joining other firms that are developing standards for agent-to-agent transactions, and on Monday said it would acquire The Clearing Company, enabling Coinbase to compete in ""prediction markets,"" in which participants bet on events such as elections and sports. 

By expanding its products, Coinbase's strategy is to sell products to banks and fintechs that can ease the adoption of crypto-related services by offering a marketplace of services.

""We hope the banks are looking to not just solve today's problem but to build operations for digital assets. That's where 'crypto as a service' can be an enormous contributor to our overall business,"" Tejpaul said. ""It's similar to AWS at Amazon."" 

Coinbase, which has its roots in cryptocurrency and stablecoins, is competing with payment technology firms such as PayPal and Stripe, which are also adding digital asset technology to their core payment services. In a research note, Deutsche Bank, which last week initiated coverage of Coinbase with a Buy rating, said, ""The next phase of growth is on-chain. Deutsche sees Coinbase evolving beyond a traditional exchange into an 'everything exchange' that captures a broader share of on-chain activity across retail and institutional segments.""

Deutsche also suggests Coinbase is protecting itself from the rapid valuation changes that often afflict cryptocurrencies. ""While crypto volume and sentiment remain key drivers, Deutsche highlights Coinbase's growing mix of durable and recurring revenue, from USDC to institutional services, as a strategic hedge against macro volatility.""

In another research note, KeyBank Capital Markets said Coinbase's product announcements are a ""clear reflection"" of efforts to broaden service while extending institutional leadership with new technology for developers. 

""As it relates to exchange updates, we like Coinbase's 'everything exchange' vision and are constructive on Coinbase enabling access to other asset classes,"" KeyBank analysts said. 



The cryptocurrency company has entered partnerships with big banks and payment giant Klarna in recent days. Coinbase exec Brett Tejpaul says the GENIUS Act is creating an opportunity to sell a broad range of digital asset technology. 

Terron T. Brown used stolen mail and social media recruits to defraud banks such as PNC and Bank of America of millions, highlighting a rising industry threat.

Some consumers have been waiting a year and a half to get their money back.

Ida Liu, who resigned from Citi earlier this year, will join HSBC on Jan. 5 as the CEO of the private bank. Liu will be tasked with accelerating the growth of the private bank ""at a defining moment for wealth,"" she said in a LinkedIn post.

Once its second deal in less than three years closes midway through 2026, the Alexandria-based company will operate more than 100 branches and hold $11 billion in assets. 

The bank technology company is adding offices in the U.S. and India as part of its quest to reach clients outside of its U.K. home base.

I remember much of the positive sentiment around Python in the early days being less about Python and more about how powerful Perl is but Perl is Perl. Python being the nice and clean version of Perl meant it got all all the praise of Perl while enjoying the reputation of having none of the failings of Perl. In hindsight I think Python needed to stand on its own right, not just as a better Perl, but yet here we are. I think hindsight will show we should have considered the defects of Python more deeply. I know the lispers saw them but no one listens to them. Today Python is most dominant language on the planet and Perl is all but forgotten.If you survey the language landscape now, a language can be much better than Python but never get the chance Python did just because it happened to look a bit better than Perl. Which is absurd to me.

9. Python got lucky that its inevitable screwups (Python3) didn't quite kill it.10. Swift and Kotlin both define programming as serving the compiler (specifically LLVM) rather than serving the coder's problem. (I haven't discussed Rust so far since it isn't attempting to compete with 98% of Python use cases, but if you squint you can see it as going one step further than Swift and Kotlin and in effect forcing the coder to be a sort of human compiler who thinks in types and memory management. This is not a criticism of Rust, BTW.)0. And behind all of this is Moore's Law and the demographic explosion of programmers. Python was an implicit, perhaps unconscious bet that if you served people thoughtfully, the tradeoffs with serving the needs of contemporary silicon wouldn't matter as much.

It is far and away the most common footgun novices run into when I'm answering questions about why their code doesn't work.

It was, in my experience, before Python 3 clamped down on mixed spaces on tabs; before the `SyntaxError`s got better (for example the handling of `try` without `except`); and before VSCode got so popular (such that all the novices were using who-even-knows-what random editor and you had to figure out every time how they were actually producing the indentation, whether it does/can convert tabs to spaces).And, oddly enough, before LLMs. Not so much because they explain anything all that well, but because lazy clueless people now get correctly indented code generated in-place rather than copying and pasting from Stack Overflow and not having any clue how to make the pasted code line up properly.But now I far more often see people who are clueless enough that they can't distinguish the REPL from a command line (""why is `pip install ...` a syntax error?""), or are struggling with whatever is the latest attempt by the Python team to make Python easier to install and manage on Windows, or who seemingly can't wrap their head around the idea that Python has to know where on disk to look for the installed libraries (or why it won't work to just put everything in the system environment). And in terms of the language itself, probably the biggest stumbling blocks are things like command-query separation (""why can't I `foo.append(bar).append(baz)`?"") and just using functions properly (which typically boils down to ""why doesn't `return foo` let me refer to `foo` in the calling function?"", but generally stated completely differently).

Python gets a lot of grief from the perspective of people who are frustrated because they didn't start off using virtual environments and now their global python package namespace is a nightmare.  Legit criticisms, but for many non-developer python users those problems are somebody else's problems.  Given the readership on this site... they're most likely our problems, but we aren't the users that python is made for.  We're support for those users.It's winning because its audience is not code specialists, but other kinds of specialists which sometimes need to use code.  Their work often has a sort of immediate importance that ours often doesn't.  It's not evaluated based on whether the techies like it, it's evaluated based on whether the scientists, the analysist, the students, and the {non-computery-engineering} Engineers like it.

Even if they ask about the syntax design people just dismiss their question with saying ""syntax is not important"". Python did the opposite, it focused on syntax over everything else. That caught on with beginners and now here we are.Of course with AI Python got even more popular, but even before ChatGPT was released it was already dominant.

Basically every languages mostly escapes scrutiny except from very niche corners (usually people deeply committed to other languages that aren't actually considering alternatives, but criticizing everything that isn't their preferred language for not being their preferred language) until it succeeds, because there are enough of them that basically no one cares to put the time into scrutinizing them until they achieve a critical mass.That's not why Python succeeded against other languages.

* Python has clean and readable syntax that a complete beginner can understand -- it's really close to the pseudocode you might use for teaching.* Python has a good standard library, so you can do a lot before you need to work out how to install more (and, reproducibility concerns aside, `pip install` is really simple once you get there)* Because it was easy to pick up and easy to use for teaching, it took over some niches like stats in academia / data-analysis, where the people doing the work aren't professional programmers but just need something they can hack together. Once NumPy existed, people had minimal incentive to move away.(Insert Marge Simpson ""I just think it's neat"" gif here.)

If you are trying to solve a problem, the last thing you want to be thinking about is the language itself.The language you adopt to code up a solution should force you to think clearly, but no more than that. Executable pseudocode is as close to an ideal state as you can get for a high-level language.Perl, meanwhile, was filled with multiple ways to do things -- famously and absurdly thought of as a virtue -- reveled in side effects, and did so much implicit work with variables and flow that perl was often unreadable by anybody else, including the you of three months from now.""Python did everything other scripting languages did, but in a cleaner and more comprehensible way""  tells you most of what you need to know about Python's victory, but the death blow was delivered by the perl community's love of complexity, which led to the disaster that was Raku.By the turn of the century, it was clear that python 3 was a better plan for the future than perl 6.

It's really not the crux of the issue though. “Better than Perl for normal developers” is not a high bar. Most languages clear that bar whether they are successful or not. This is certainly not the only reason that Python became so successful.Tangentially, in my experience Perl was great for one liners and small glue projects. I never saw significant, valuable works of code built in Perl even when I worked at a company (Yahoo) that widely used Perl. I am convinced that much of Perl's beauty is in its cleverness and's not in its utility for large projects.

Dial the clock back to 2002, and this statement is not true. Perl became popular not because of its beauty, but because of it being extremely effective glue. It was a language to get stuff done while writing little code.The only mainstream alternative was Python.

That's like, your opinion. Python was explicitly designed being easy to learn, borrowing heavily from ABC, which actually experimented with different syntaxes to see what works and what doesn't. The indentations apparently helps a lot with this, along with ':' before the introduction of indented blocks.

Python is simple to read / write and easier to reason about, especially for people that need a programming language to solve a problem but are not software engineers.The reason it won, especially in data analysis, is because most data analyst are/were not software engineer and Python feels more natural to people.The indentation is not a big problem when a decent text editor is used

It felt pretty easy to read and write, had minimal surprises, and it made writing simple programs easy.  The batteries-includedness was great.It felt like it was designed by a smart guy for practical programming, rather than by a brilliant academic who was wed to purity for maximum elegance.  It accepted some warts, but them in mostly ergonomic places.It was dictated by people who could relegate map, filter, and reduce from builtins to the library.  As much as I personally even liked map in particular (I am not super anti functional programming), it's nice to realize the designer had the taste to prefer longer but more explicit programs.    ys = [f(x) for x in xs]
    ys = map(f, xs)

As much as I disliked that particular decision, there is no doubt to me that it is just designed for lower cognitive burden when doing simple/common things.If you show both of those lines of code to a person in cs101 who has studied Java for a couple months but hasn't seen Python, I am pretty sure they are gonna understand the first line way quicker.  Mostly consistent decision making like that leads to ergonomic, practical languages.  And they win.It fits in people's brains better.  See also, pytorch vs tensorflow.

In short (all below is my opinion): it was popular in academia and got some corporate adoption, so when ML exploded in popularity it was a natural choice as the scripting language for ML tooling. On top of that it's easy to pick up as a language, and it's a general purpose language - there are lots of scientific tools like pandas written in it, there are web frameworks, etc.Perl was too quirky for wide adoption and it stopped developing (Raku/Perl 6 took to long to develop), PHP was focused purely on the web, similarly JS. Ruby could have won, I like it more than Python, but outside of Japan it's also mostly been associated with web development (because of Rails), it also lacked libraries that Python already had.

Against Perl? Over a decade ago. 10 years ago, the only places that required Perl were either hard engineering (i.e. non-programmer EEs) or those with legacy code bases.Over everything else? Of course not. You don't do systems level work in Python.The problems with Python are minor (other than packaging), and not a big enough pain to adopt another language. If you really could benefit from static typing, there are already existing languages that do the job well (C++, Rust, etc).For the majority (including even some Perl fans), switching to Python was a significantly better experience. If you now show me a language better than Python, it's really only an incremental benefit. Sure, I prefer ML languages like F#, but the vast majority don't.

Larry Wall, creator of Perl, coined the phrase, ""make the easy things easy, and the hard things possible"".  But the things perl made easy were not always things that the market needed.   Perl was very distrustful of enterprise disciplines and the perl culture ""let a thousand flowers bloom"" mentality (which they/we called ""There's more than one way to do it""/(TMTOWTDI)) was not actually useful for organizations maintaining larger code bases/systems with large groups of mixed skill level people.Python threaded that needle of centralizing a right way to do things (not just whitespaces) more effectively.I also observed Scala suffering from similarly disfunctional ""TMTOWTDI"" dynamic in organizations I belonged to; different people had wildly different styles of solving even basic problems and it really made code hard to maintain even in smaller organizations where people came and went and new people were onboarded frequently.Plus data science use cases saved Python's web/scripting lifespan in a way slightly analogous to AI/CUDA extending NVidia's 3D graphics-centric roots. (Although the python data science ecosystem nowdays does have some TMTOWTDI weaknesses that remind me of perl/cpan's choices of web development frameworks of the mid-2000s!)

Perl has so many ways to write the same code, no two codebases are the same - it's practically different languages. Back when I was programming Perl, I remember reading my own Perl scripts I wrote few years ago, and being annoyed with how they were doing everything all wrong... because in those few years, my Perl style has changed significantly. And others' scripts were even worse!Plus, python had all those neat quality-of-life things useful for day-to-day scripting. For example actual function parameters, exceptions (no more ""or die"" after each open), pretty big stdlib (I _don't_ miss having to configure ""cpan"" on each new machine), repr() in language core, etc..And yes, Python got lucky somewhat - there was a need for ""Perl but easier to read and friendlier to new users"", and Python has filled that need. And now that need is no longer open, so it's harder for newcomers to fill that niche. But that's life in general - Rust filled the niche of ""No overheads like C++ but memory safe"", Go has filled the niche of ""Compiled systems language with GC"" etc... And once a language gets popular, network effects kick in.

I think there's a few key features for python that have definitely been a big help for it:It's highly dynamic meaning you can get running with it before understanding every detail (no compile step, no static typing etc).It may not be the best at everything, but is a decent choice for most things, making a good generic intro language for programming.It has good interop with low level languages - this is a big deal for data science where a less technical (from a CS perspective) user still needs the performance of a language like C/Fortran/Rust/etc. Python's pattern of ""use python as a high level api for libraries in those other languages"" (as in numpy, pandas, polars, pytorch etc).That last one has been a big deal recently, python has become the de-facto language for data science as a result of this.

Perl's alien syntax and how there were multiple competing “best practices” put off newcomers and made it difficult to code review.Perl also stagnated for quite some time due to the efforts to move to Perl 6, though python likewise stalled later it already had better traction at that point.However I'd argue that Perl lost to PHP at least as much as it lost to python. PHP was revolutionary at the time for how easy and straightforward it was to do simple web programming which was one of the big use cases for Perl.By the early 2010s there wasn't much of any use case that made sense to choose Perl. Sysadmin scripting was clearer to review and maintain in python and golang, web applications moved to php and frameworks written in languages that didn't have the downsides of Perl.

After all these years, I assume it must measure in the tens to hundreds of thousands?It's in those moments of consideration that I understand humanity hasn't done a very good job grappling with its frailty and mortality. If we had, then we'd have a crowned a winner that didn't subjugate us endlessly to the most vapid and Sisyphean aspects of programming. Python is a lesson in managing existential angst, which I now assume was the point of it from the very beginning.

Python is a nice language, but so are others. I know of three main libraries -- three main ""I can get stuff done"" -- eras with Python, and I think these drove Python.1. Beautiful Soup. Early/mid 2000s, web scraping and website / XML / HTML data manipulation were a thing; this library came along and made it easy. I'd heard of Python before on places like Slashdot; it was cool but Perl was more spoken of. Then, in my anecdotal experience, what I suddenly read about was not Perl or Python, but Beautiful Soup.2. NumPy / SciPy. Python was apparently written with numerical computing in mind, and NumPy in its current form arrived a bit after BS. Early 2000s: stats and data vis folk were using R. By the 2010s, I was hearing about all these people that were not using R, but were using NumPy and SciPy.3. AI. Until a few years ago, it was all SciPy, then with the current era, everyone is using Python -- for AI.None of this is the language, per se. People were not 'using Python'; they were (say) using SciPy.I think Python benefited hugely from having not a single ""I can achieve stuff"" value proposition, like VB did; it had three consecutively in a row.These all had roots well before they became well-known. Enthusiasts, initial design, years of work and usage, and 'suddenly' out of nowhere everyone is using it. The common factor there is likely Python's design and community; there would be lower level reasons for Python's success than the things it let users achieve, and those would be, what incentivised or led to Python being used for those libraries (value enablers) in the first place. I can't speak to that; I wasn't there in the Python community in the 90s or 2000s.[*] Not always: Rust's value is in its memory system and safety. That is not a library but inbuilt, yet that still is something you can do, a goal, value, something you achieve using the language and thus you turn to the language in order to achieve. Rust minus that would need some other reason to be used.

The Python leadership group is friendly towards beginners and people with non-traditional backgrounds, and they actively reach out and recruit those folks to participate. It's also one of the least toxic developer communities I know of.That matters a lot in a field like data science or cybersecurity, which has a lot of people who don't have traditional SWE backgrounds.The language is pleasant and readable to use and has a lot of features built in, which Perl did not, but I think that's much less critical than the network effect of being a (1) welcoming and pleasant community who (2) actively recruits new fields of people.

A large chunk of Spotify could soon be available to download online for free, if you've got enough disk space to spare.

Anna's Archive, a controversial non-profit project that aims to preserve all of humanity's culture and knowledge, announced over the weekend that it has managed to back up Spotify in a massive archive.

Typically, the open-source site focuses on books, magazines, and academic papers, pulling them from shadow libraries, official collections, and other sources and making them available via torrents. But now, Anna's Archive is turning its attention to music, starting with Spotify.

“This Spotify scrape is our humble attempt to start such a ‘preservation archive' for music,” the people behind Anna's Archive wrote in a blog post. “Of course Spotify doesn't have all the music in the world, but it's a great start.”

According to the post, the group discovered some time ago how to scrape Spotify at scale and decided it was in a position to build a music archive focused on preservation.

Anna's Archive claims it has backed up metadata for 256 million tracks and audio files for about 86 million of them. The total size of the collection comes in just under 300 terabytes. Most of the files were scraped before July 2025, meaning newer releases may be missing.

While the project only scraped a fraction of Spotify's total music files, it says the collection still represents roughly 99.6% of music actually listened to on the platform.

For instance, it estimates that Spotify's top three songs have more combined streams than the bottom 20 to 100 million tracks put together. Those songs are Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars's “Die With a Smile” (3 billion streams), Billie Eilish's “Birds of a Feather” (3.1 billion streams), and Bad Bunny's “DtMF” (1 billion streams).

The non-profit acknowledged that music is already being preserved in various ways, but said many existing efforts have major shortcomings. Among the issues is an overemphasis on the most popular artists, a fixation on the highest possible audio quality (which makes comprehensive archiving impractical due to file size), and the lack of an authoritative torrent index meant to represent all recorded music.

Anna's Archive said the files will be released in phases, starting with metadata, followed by audio files (shared in order of popularity) and then album art.

“With your help, humanity's musical heritage will be forever protected from destruction by natural disasters, wars, budget cuts, and other catastrophes,” the project's blog read.

The streaming giant, unsurprisingly, is not thrilled.

“Spotify has identified and disabled the nefarious user accounts that engaged in unlawful scraping. We've implemented new safeguards for these types of anti-copyright attacks and are actively monitoring for suspicious behavior,” a Spotify spokesperson told Gizmodo in an emailed statement. “Since day one, we have stood with the artist community against piracy, and we are actively working with our industry partners to protect creators and defend their rights.”

A study published in Engineering shows that a protein called U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1 (U2AF1), released by immune cells known as macrophages, helps grow new blood vessels in the heart after a myocardial infarction (MI) by altering how the gene Yap1 is spliced. The findings point to a new mechanism through which immune cells support heart repair and suggest U2AF1 could serve as a marker for recovery potential.

Researchers from Harbin Medical University and their collaborators focused on the role of macrophage-derived exosomes—tiny vesicles that carry proteins and genetic material—following treatment with nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a precursor to the vital nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD⁺). In both mouse models and human samples, NMN was found to shift macrophages toward a repair-promoting state, increasing their release of exosomes containing U2AF1.

In mouse experiments, exosomes from NMN-treated macrophages improved heart function after MI, as measured by echocardiography. These exosomes reduced infarct size and fibrosis, while enhancing capillary density in the border zone of damaged tissue. The beneficial effects were linked to the uptake of exosomes by endothelial cells, which line blood vessels and are central to forming new vessels. [The research adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and received approval from the Ethics Committee of Harbin Medical University (No. IRB5016723).]

Proteomic analysis of the exosomes revealed that U2AF1, a splicing factor involved in RNA processing, was among the most enriched proteins. When U2AF1 was overexpressed specifically in endothelial cells, mice showed better recovery after MI, with increased vascularization and improved cardiac output. Conversely, mice with endothelial-specific deletion of U2af1 had poorer outcomes, including reduced survival, larger infarcts, and lower capillary density.

Further investigation showed that U2AF1 regulates alternative splicing of Yap1, a transcriptional regulator in the Hippo pathway. Specifically, U2AF1 promoted the inclusion of exon 4 in Yap1 mRNA, favoring the formation of the Yap1-2γ isoform over Yap1-1δ. Overexpression of Yap1-2γ enhanced endothelial cell migration and tube formation in vitro, while Yap1-1δ had a weaker effect. These results suggest that U2AF1-mediated splicing of Yap1 fine-tunes the angiogenic response after heart injury.

In clinical samples, plasma U2AF1 levels were significantly lower in patients with acute myocardial infarction compared to those with unstable angina. Among MI patients, individuals with poorly developed coronary collateral vessels—assessed using the Rentrop scoring system—had lower U2AF1 levels than those with better collateral circulation. This correlation supports the idea that circulating U2AF1 may reflect the heart's ability to form compensatory vessels after an infarction.

The study builds on previous findings that NAD⁺ metabolism influences macrophage behavior and vascular repair. NMN, as a booster of NAD⁺, was shown to enhance the release of reparative exosomes from macrophages, offering a potential therapeutic route. Unlike direct NMN administration, which has limited tissue specificity, exosome-based delivery may allow targeted modulation of endothelial function.

The researchers caution that while U2AF1 shows promise as both a therapeutic target and a biomarker, further work is needed to validate its clinical utility. Variability in circulating U2AF1 over time and across individuals will need to be addressed in larger and longer-term studies. Nonetheless, the study provides a clearer picture of how immune-endothelial communication shapes heart repair and identifies a previously underappreciated role for RNA splicing in post-MI angiogenesis.

Kara Grace Miller's short documentary “My Neighbor's Yard” was set to make its online debut November 4, 2025 — Election Day — via Vimeo Staff Picks, long known as the premier online platform for festival-quality shorts. Rather than a lengthy festival run, Miller wanted maximum eyeballs on the film about how politically divided neighbors in her hometown of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, used their front yards to campaign during the 2024 presidential election.

And then, on October 24, Staff Picks suddenly rescinded its invitation due to “political content.”

 










Three weeks prior, on October 1, Phoebe Hart's “Bug Diner” made its Staff Picks debut — only to be pulled two days later. The stop-motion animated short previously won five Oscar-qualifying festivals, including the Sundance and SXSW Jury Prizes. No formal explanation was offered to Hart at the time, but IndieWire can confirm it was a decision made by Vimeo's Legal and Trust & Safety teams due to its sexual content. (You can watch “My Neighbor's Yard” here and “Bug Diner” here.)

The Staff Pick logo looks like a prestigious film festival laurel and has come to stand for a trusted curatorial brand. Not only can it drive tens of thousands of views to an indie short, but those views come from within the creative and filmmaking communities that matter. Among its thousands of selections since 2008, it's played a key role in the careers of filmmakers like Kogonada, The Daniels, Alan Yang, and David Lowery.

“My Neighbor's Yard” producer Andrew Wonder has three Staff Picks to his credit and believes he owes much of his career to the platform. His first Pick came 14 years ago with “Undercity,” a short documentary about the tunnels beneath New York City, and it “changed the course of my career,” he said.

“The press I got, the features in the [New York] Times and Wired,” he said. “I was on ‘The Today Show.' Vimeo got me so much closer to my audience, to my peers, to the people I'm meeting at the film festivals, to the community that I feel like I represent and I communicate with as a creator, and so that's why I've always held it as a sacred place.”

Vimeo's Staff Picks are unique in the online ecosystem. Ad-free and with no paywall or major media conglomerate backing, it's funded largely by users; Vimeo's top revenue source remains the subscribers who use Vimeo as a professional tool to host, share, and submit their work to film festivals and clients. Combined with a curation team that filmmakers believe represents the values of their creative community, it has for years filled the online gap between festivals and the audience.

 










Sources said Staff Picks' four-person curation team, led by longtime members Meghan Oretsky and Ina Pira, was alarmed by the interference. Until then, the only limits on their selections were Vimeo's standard terms of service, which prohibit content that incites violence or qualifies as pornographic. Over a three-week period in October, however, Vimeo's Legal and Trust & Safety teams rescinded invitations for “Bug Diner,” “My Neighbor's Yard,” and four more shorts. The curation team strongly disagreed with those decisions and unsuccessfully appealed them, as they made clear in an apologetic email to Miller.

“[Vimeo's Legal and Trust & Safety teams] are taking a conservative approach that the curation team does not agree with and we're still working on our response,” wrote a member of the Staff Picks curation team to Miller. “We've been fighting with them over sexual content on the platform but this escalation to censor political content is an unsettling development that we find unacceptable.”

Lost on no one involved was that on September 10, Vimeo entered a definitive agreement to be acquired for $1.38 billion by Bending Spoons, a Milan-based tech company that also owns AOL, Brightcove, Evernote, and WeTransfer. The sale occurred on the same day as right-wing political activist and media personality Charlie Kirk's assassination, a moment that cast a chill over political speech in corporate media.

 










According to Vimeo, however, this was not a top-down problem. In fact, only with IndieWire's inquiry weeks later did CEO Phillip Moyer learn there was a problem.

Responding to IndieWire, Vimeo said neither its acquisition nor the political environment played a role in rejecting the Staff Picks selections. In a detailed on-the-record interview, Moyer said it wasn't censorship, but a mistake due to “a failure of our internal processes and a failure of an appeal process.” Vimeo declined to make anyone from Staff Picks curation team available for comment.

According to Moyer, at issue is 22 child protection regulations implemented between November 2023 and November 2025, including Florida HB 3, New York SAFE for Kids Act, Texas SCOPE Act, Ohio Parental-Consent Law, as well as online safety acts passed in the United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, Malaysia, and Turkey.

“We've been working tirelessly to try to make sure that we are in compliance with literally dozens of regulations that keep coming out around child safety,” he said.

Vimeo was challenged by finding an efficient process to ensure that all 10 billion minutes of video it hosts are compliant with the new regulations. Moyer said the process of first using technology, then humans, to scan and flag potential problems failed to adequately protect the Staff Picks curation from the initial broad sweep in October. 

 










As a result, Moyer said, Miller and Hart's shorts, along with Andy Reid's “Testing,” Viktoria Traub's “Shoes and Hooves,” Theo Abadie's “Chico,” Mansi Maheshwari's “Bunnyhood,” and Chan Tan Lui's “Keep Out” were swept up in Vimeo's rush to implement the safeguards.

Moyer said when the issue was brought to his attention, he quickly watched the shorts and concurred with the curation team's evaluation. He also realized he had a far bigger problem on his hands than these six films. 

For example, “My Neighbor's Yard” was far less politically charged than dozens of prior Staff Picks. Miller said she made the film as a hopeful example in divided times: “In Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, from way before this political chasm has deepened, we've been going to church together, we've been going to soccer practice together, we've been each other's neighbors, and we've figured it out thus far. I think it serves as an example [that] we decide how to coexist with each other moving forward as the chasm deepens.”

And yet, Vimeo pulled “My Neighbor's Yard” from Staff Picks over two brief images of a Trump supporter's yard in which the president's Butler, Pennsylvania assassination attempt was restaged using two Halloween skeletons and a Trump mask (see photo below). Moyer said that when he examined each film, he found similarly benign material that, viewed in context, fell nowhere near the new regulatory line.

 










“As I look back, I had to go, ‘Hey, how did this happen? And why didn't I know about this?,'” said Moyer.

Moyer said the rush to implement regulatory safeguards created confusion, especially for Derick Rhodes, VP of Community, who oversees the Staff Picks curation team.

“I made the assumption incorrectly that everyone was on the same page,” Rhodes told IndieWire. “I feel pretty bad about what's happened because I should have known as soon as those conversations started that something was a little off, or maybe people were moving too fast. I just assumed leadership had signed off on this.”

Moyer said he's since implemented a clear and efficient appeals process and returned curatorial independence to the Staff Picks team. Going forward, said Rhodes and Moyer, if a film did not violate Vimeo's TOS the Staff Picks evaluation of the film was enough to overturn any decision. 

Rhodes said the review most often flagged animated shorts like “Bug Diner.” Although the films targeted adults, Vimeo's Trust & Safety and Legal teams raised concerns that regulators could interpret the content as appealing to children and in violation of new child-safety rules. After further review, Rhodes said the “mature” warning label should generally suffice, since Staff Picks targets audiences seeking cutting-edge work, not children's programming.

 










With the exception of “My Neighbor's Yard,” Moyer said they did not encounter political films being flagged. “You can be political and be Staff Picked,” said Moyer. “What we are dealing with here is a mistake on our part that we corrected.”

However, emails reviewing social media logistics between the curation team and filmmakers show that concerns about appearing to platform political content predated the three-week window in October. Five weeks before Vimeo rescinded “My Neighbor's Yard,” Miller was told not to expect the platform's usual social media support for her film's launch because the company's social team was “skittish about anything political.” In a later exchange, staff suggested Miller remain “neutral-ish” in any content she posted on her own Instagram account if she wanted Vimeo to share it.

Moyer personally reached out to the six filmmakers to apologize and invite their shorts back to Staff Picks; four filmmakers accepted. Miller chose to post her film on Short of the Week (operated by former Staff Picks curator Jason Sondhi) while Hart went forward with her plan to feature “Bug Diner” on revenue-generating YouTube channel Bizaar Studios, an up-and-coming indie animation platform. She'd previously delayed Bizaar to accommodate Vimeo's demand for an exclusive window.

 










“Vimeo's corporate side took my film down for the same exact reason they want to put it back up, risk management,” said Hart in a statement to IndieWire as to why she rejected Moyer's offer. “I don't want to signal to new filmmakers and indie audiences that this was a win for me, because it doesn't feel that way. It's difficult because I trust the intentions and tastes of the staff pick curation team, but unless it becomes clear that the corporate side of the platform is making major shifts back towards a filmmaker-first ethos, I'm not sure it's worth it for me.”

Miller rejected the offer to reinstate “My Neighbor's Yard” for similar reasons. She was concerned that if she didn't speak up during the short window when the corporate interference was visible, it could be overlooked.

“If I don't say something, then the censorship lives on in private through rejections and omissions and me accepting the staff pick doesn't erase that,” Miller told IndieWire. “It just puts a Band-Aid on it.”

Bon Iver, Gracie Abrams, and the National's Aaron Dessner have released a new song, “Sold Out,” to benefit the gun violence prevention organization Everytown. Though Justin Vernon has often collaborated with Dessner, and Abrams and Dessner are ongoing songwriting partners—not to mention that Abrams has covered Bon Iver's “Beach Baby”—“Sold Out” is the first formal collaboration between Vernon and Abrams. Head to Bandcamp to buy the song, which has not been made available to stream.

The three artists said in a joint statement that they made “Sold Out” last year in the wake of a school shooting. “We were reminded of it this week as our hearts were broken yet again,” they wrote, apparently referring to the Brown University shooting. “It's a sad one to share during the holidays, but the world is hurting and we shouldn't look away. We are proud to support Everytown, an organization dedicated to ending gun violence in America. We are releasing this song to raise awareness of their mission of reducing gun violence. Please visit their website for more information on the unbelievable work they do. Sending so much love to you all.”
