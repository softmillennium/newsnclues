Fox Chase Cancer Center's Dr. Randall Lee joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss why cancer diagnosis rates are on the rise, what contributes to the trend and the benefits of a post-Thanksgiving meal walk. Barry Manilow revealed that doctors recently discovered a cancerous spot on his lung. What started as lingering bronchitis turned into an unexpected medical discovery for Manilow, one he says was caught early thanks to a "great doctor." Manilow shared the health update with fans Monday on Instagram. "Even though I was over the bronchitis and back on stage at the Westgate Las Vegas, my wonderful doctor ordered an MRI just to make sure that everything was OK. The MRI discovered a cancerous spot on my left lung that needs to be removed. "The bad news is that now that the Christmas A Gift of Love concerts are over I'm going into surgery to have the spot removed," he continued. Just chicken soup and I Love Lucy reruns." Singer Barry Manilow announced he will undergo surgery to remove a cancerous spot on his lung after doctors discovered it following weeks of bronchitis. Manilow does not have to endure chemotherapy or radiation, but will need time off to recover. He revealed his upcoming January shows have been rescheduled. "The only follow-up is a month to recover and that means we have to reschedule the January arena concerts," Manilow wrote. A post shared by Barry Manilow (@barrymanilowofficial) He added: "I'm very sorry that you have to change your plans. Just like you, we were all looking forward to the January shows and hate having to move everything around." Barry Manilow said he will take time off to recover after surgery to remove a cancerous spot on his lung, prompting him to reschedule his January concerts. Manilow began his career writing ad jingles after studying at Juilliard. He created some of the best known jingles, including McDonald's "You Deserve a Break Today" and State Farm's "Like a Good Neighbor." Barry Manilow built a legendary music career after starting as a jingle writer before breaking through with his 1974 hit "Mandy." Manilow later released "I Write the Songs," "Could It Be Magic," "Copacabana" and "Looks Like We Made It," cementing himself as one of the most successful pop artists of the 1970s and 1980s. Manilow built his career through craftsmanship plus industry work and then seized the spotlight with a perfectly timed pop hit.

New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani joined Jewish actor Mandy Patinkin and his family in a video celebrating the first night of Hanukkah. New York Attorney General Letitia James and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., will swear in New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, his transition office announced. James will administer the oath of office to Mamdani at midnight on Jan. 1, while Sanders will swear him in again at the public inauguration later that day. "At a moment when democracy is under attack and cynicism about our politics runs deep, Zohran Mamdani represents a new generation of progressive leadership rooted in courage, integrity and solidarity," Sanders said in a statement. "His victory is not just about one city or one election, it is about the strength of a working class movement that says unequivocally: the future of New York belongs to the people, not the billionaire class. It is my honor to swear him in as the next mayor of New York City," he added. Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani will be sworn in on Jan. 1. Mamdani thanked the pair of politicians for their willingness to participate. "It is an honor to be sworn in by two leaders I have admired for years: Attorney General Tish James and Senator Bernie Sanders. Attorney General James has taken on powerful interests in her defense of New Yorkers and embodied the principle of equal justice before the law," Mamdani said in a statement. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., will swear in Mamdani at a public inauguration. I can think of no better leaders to help usher in a new era for New York City," he continued. New York Attorney General Letitia James will formally swear in Mamdani at midnight on Jan. 1. The Jan. public inauguration will be a much larger affair than for past mayors, whose inauguration events have traditionally been limited to roughly 4,000 tickets. Mamdani has instead opted to hold viewing areas and a public block party on Broadway. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK (AP) — The Senate's top Democrat urged his colleagues Monday to take legal action over the Justice Department's incremental and heavily redacted release of records pertaining to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer introduced a resolution that, if passed, would direct the Senate to file or join lawsuits aimed at forcing the Justice Department to comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the law enacted last month that required disclosure of records by last Friday. In lieu of Republican support, Schumer's resolution is largely symbolic. Even then, it'll likely face an uphill battle for passage. But it allows Democrats to continue a pressure campaign for disclosure that Republicans had hoped to put behind them. So far, the department hasn't given any notice when new records arrive. That approach angered some accusers and members of Congress who fought to pass the transparency act. Records that were released, including photographs, interview transcripts, call logs, court records and other documents, were either already public or heavily blacked out, and many lacked necessary context. Some of the most eagerly awaited records, such as FBI victim interviews and internal memos shedding light on charging decisions, weren't there. Nor were there any mentions of some powerful figures who've been in Epstein's orbit, like Britain's former Prince Andrew. Blanche pledged that the Trump administration would meet its obligation required by law. But he stressed that the department was obligated to act with caution as it goes about making public thousands of documents that can include sensitive information. Blanche, the Justice Department's second-in-command, also defended its decision to remove several files related to the case from its public webpage, including a photograph showing Trump, less than a day after they were posted. The missing files, which were available Friday but no longer accessible by Saturday, included images of paintings depicting nude women, and one showed a series of photographs along a credenza and in drawers. In that image, inside a drawer among other photos, was a photograph of Trump, alongside Epstein, Melania Trump and Epstein's longtime associate, Ghislaine Maxwell. Blanche said the documents were removed because they also showed victims of Epstein. “We are not redacting information around President Trump, around any other individual involved with Mr. Epstein, and that narrative, which is not based on fact at all, is completely false,” Blanche told NBC's “Meet the Press.” Blanche said Trump, a Republican, has labeled the Epstein matter “a hoax” because “there's this narrative out there that the Department of Justice is hiding and protecting information about him, which is completely false.” Associated Press reporter Kevin Freking in Washington contributed to this report.</p>

People attend a ceremony to mark the National Day of Reflection for victims and survivors, at Bondi Beach in Sydney, Sunday, Dec. 21, 2025, following the Bondi shooting on Dec. 14. MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — A man accused of killing 15 people at Sydney's Bondi Beach conducted firearms training in an area of New South Wales state outside of Sydney with his father, according to Australian police documents released on Monday. The documents, made public following Naveed Akram's video court appearance from a Sydney hospital where he has been treated for an abdominal injury, said the two men recorded footage justifying the meticulously planned attack. The 24-year-old and his father began their attack by throwing four improvised explosive devices toward a crowd celebrating an annual Jewish event at Bondi Beach, but the devices failed to explode, the documents said. Police described the devices as three aluminum pipe bombs and a tennis ball bomb containing an explosive, gunpowder and steel ball bearings. None detonated, but police described them as “viable” IEDs. CCTV recorded them carrying what police allege were two shotguns, a rifle, five IEDs and two homemade Islamic State group flags wrapped in blankets. Police also released images of the gunmen shooting from a footbridge, providing them with an elevated vantage point and the protection of waist-high concrete walls. An open car boot/trunk with what police say are explosives inside What police say is the men shooting during target practice What police say is the men shooting during target practice Authorities have charged Akram with 59 offenses, including 15 counts of murder, 40 counts of causing harm with intent to murder in relation to the wounded survivors and one count of committing a terrorist act. The New South Wales government introduced draft laws to Parliament on Monday that Premier Chris Minns said would become the toughest in Australia. That would have excluded Sajid Akram, who was an Indian citizen with a permanent resident visa. Sajid Akram also legally owned six rifles and shotguns. Police said a video found on Naveed Akram's phone shows him with his father expressing “their political and religious views and appear to summarise their justification for the Bondi terrorist attack.” Video shot in October shows them “firing shotguns and moving in a tactical manner” on grassland surrounded by trees, police said. “There is evidence that the Accused and his father meticulously planned this terrorist attack for many months,” police allege. Victims' funerals continued Monday with French national Dan Elkayam's service held in the nearby suburb of Woollahra, at the heart of Sydney's Jewish life. The 27-year-old moved from Paris to Sydney a year ago.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Minneapolis mayoral candidate Omar Fateh slammed Vice President JD Vance on Sunday after he joked at Turning Point USA's AmericaFest that Fateh was running for “mayor of Mogadishu.” Fateh is ethnically Somalian but was born in the United States. “My father came to America on a scholarship in the early 60's, during the civil rights era, and earned a masters in engineering. Looks like you took time away from the couch to try out comedy.” The Democratic Minnesota state senator lost to incumbent Mayor Jacob Frey in November's mayoral election after receiving Rep. Ilhan Omar's (D-MN) endorsement. Vance hit out at Fateh and Omar as he was criticizing Democrats for the quality of their candidates. “They are not sending their best,” he said. JD Vance: "They are not sending their best. “Wow so authentic,” Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) wrote on X. Say what you want about Trump but at least he knows how to deliver his burns and putdowns,” Mehdi Hasan, the CEO of left-leaning news outlet Zeteo, also wrote on social media. President Donald Trump said earlier this month that he didn't want Somalis in the country. I don't want them in our country,” Trump told reporters.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A 60 Minutes segment detailing the Trump administration's deportations to a maximum security prison in El Salvador was pulled Sunday night, stirring controversy within the news organization. Our report ‘Inside CECOT' will air in a future broadcast.” She said they had reached out to relevant government sources for a response but failed to receive one and noted that her story had been cleared by the news organization's lawyers and standards team. Alfonsi suggested Weiss wanted government sources to be interviewed and argued that CBS News has handed the Trump administration a “kill switch” for any story it finds “inconvenient” if the network chooses to air stories without a government response. We go from an investigative powerhouse to stenographer for the state,” she wrote. She said pulling the story now will stir controversy. When it fails to air without a credible explanation, the public will correctly identify this as corporate censorship,” she wrote. I care too much about this broadcast to watch it be dismantled without a fight.” When contacted for further comment by the New York Times, Alfonsi referred all questions to Weiss. “My job is to make sure that all stories we publish are the best they can be. I look forward to airing this important piece when it's ready,” she told the New York Times. Weiss arrived at CBS News in October after leading the Free Press. Ellison acquired Paramount earlier this year after settling a lawsuit with the Trump administration for $16 million. “For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that 60 Minutes has treated me far worse since the so-called ‘takeover,' than they have ever treated me before,” Trump wrote on Truth Social last week. CBS News has been accused of skewing more conservative after Weiss took over, recently interviewing Turning Point USA CEO Erika Kirk, the widow of the assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk, for one hour in a town hall event. “This CBS thing does merit an explanation right away. Schatz added, “What is happening to CBS is a terrible embarrassment and if executives think they can build shareholder value by avoiding journalism that might offend the Mad King they are about to learn a tough lesson.”</p>

Turning Point USA contributor Jack Posobiec and Heritage Foundation chief economist EJ Antoni discuss President Trump's speech in Pennsylvania and the changes he is making with affordability on ‘Fox News @ Night.' FIRST ON FOX: President Donald Trump's Department of Interior announced on Monday that, effective immediately, leases for all large-scale offshore wind projects being constructed in the United States will be paused. In a press release, DOI wrote that the pause is due to "national security risks" identified by the Department of War in "recently completed classified reports." In a press release, DOI says the pause will "give the Department, along with the Department of War and other relevant government agencies, time to work with leaseholders and state partners to assess the possibility of mitigating the national security risks posed by these projects." President Donald Trump, left, wind turbines, right (Getty) "Today's action addresses emerging national security risks, including the rapid evolution of the relevant adversary technologies, and the vulnerabilities created by large-scale offshore wind projects with proximity near our east coast population centers. President Donald Trump, with Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, takes a question from reporters after signing executive orders in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on May 23, 2025. The department highlighted unclassified reports from the U.S. government in the past that have "long found" that massive turbine blades in large-scale offshore wind projects can create radar interference called "clutter" that can obscure legitimate moving targets and generate false targets. In 2024, a Department of Energy report found that while the radar threshold for false alarm detection can be increased to reduce some of that "clutter," the radar can "miss actual targets" when that threshold is increased. "Today's action ensures that national security risks posed by offshore wind projects are appropriately addressed and that the United States government retains its ability to effectively defend the American people," the press release states.

Tragedy struck the world of NASCAR on Thursday when a plane carrying former racing star Greg Biffle, members of his family and others crashed in North Carolina. Three other people killed on board were identified as Dennis Dutton, his son Jack and Craig Wadsworth. NASCAR driver Greg Biffle (16) watches during the NASCAR Sylvania 300 auto race at the New Hampshire Motor Speedway in Loudon, New Hampshire, Sunday, Sept. 25, 2011. German's runner-up in the pairs Mandy Wotzel (L) and Ingo Steuer (2nd L) with winners Evgenia Shishkova (front right)and Vadim Naumov wave to fans in the awarding ceremony of the NHK Trophy figure skating grand prix in Nagoya, central Japan. The U.S. figure skating community took a hard hit in January 2025 when a U.S. Army helicopter collided with an American Airlines plane over the Potomac River. Six figure skaters associated with the Skating Club of Boston perished in the crash, including Jinna Han and Spencer Lane, two coaches, Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova, and Jin Han, the mother of Jinna, and Christine Lane, the mother of Spencer. Alan Kulwicki was a rising star in NASCAR. In April 1993, Kulwicki, two Hooters executives and the pilot of the jet they were on crashed on approach to landing in Tennessee. Davey Allison was victorious with the trophy after winning a race at Daytona International Speedway on Feb. 16, 1992. Davey Allison, the son of legendary NASCAR driver Bobby Allison, was a rising star in NASCAR when the helicopter he was piloting crashed in the infield at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama. The crash occurred in July 1993 – just a few months after Kulwicki died. Payne Stewart was an 11-time PGA Tour winner, who had won the U.S. Open twice and the PGA Championship once during his golf career. He died in 1999 when his private plane lost cabin pressure, killing all four passengers and both pilots. The plane continued on autopilot until it ran out of fuel and crashed in a field in South Dakota. But his humanitarian efforts are what took him from a terrific player to an all-time great. He was bringing emergency supplies to the survivors of a Nicaraguan earthquake when the overloaded plane crashed on takeoff from Puerto Rico on New Year's Eve in 1972. Five rescue workers search the wreckage of a plane crash in Huntington, West Virginia. Nearly 40 members of the Marshall Thundering Herd football team were among the 75 killed when Southern Airways Flight 932 crashed into a hill in West Virginia in 1970. Five coaches, seven staffers and 21 boosters were also on board as the team was returning home from a game against East Carolina. New York Yankees star catcher, Thurman Munson was killed Aug. 2, 1979, in a crash of his private plane near Canton, Ohio. Thurman Munson was on his way to becoming the next great New York Yankees catcher. He was named the team's first captain since Lou Gehrig. He bought a plane so he could fly it back to Ohio, his home, on his off days. Munson was paralyzed on impact and suffocated in a fire that ensued.

Roy Halladay was one of baseball's mythical pitchers, playing for the Toronto Blue Jays and Philadelphia Phillies. In 2019, Halladay crashed a sport plane he had purchased into the Gulf of Mexico. The NTSB said he was impaired by high levels of amphetamines and was attempting extreme aerobatic stunts when he lost control of the aircraft. New York Yankees pitcher Cory Lidle was killed in 2006 when the small plane he owned was blown by strong winds into a residential building in New York City.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has called for a national “gun buyback” program in the wake of the Bondi Beach massacre. But additional restrictions on gun ownership aren't the solution. Instead, they'll distract from larger, more difficult problems to solve. On December 19, Albanese announced that the Australian government will establish a “national gun buyback scheme.” The prime minister told reporters that he “expects hundreds of thousands of firearms will be collected and destroyed.” Albanese's proposal came less than a week after the Bondi Beach massacre, in which two gunmen murdered 15 Jews and wounded at least 40 more at a Hanukkah celebration. But more gun control won't solve either. In fact, it may make things even worse. Australia already has highly restrictive laws on gun ownership. In 1996, the country passed the National Firearms Agreement (NFA) prohibiting many commonly used rifles, shotguns, and other long guns. Concealed carry for citizens is prohibited and self-defense is not considered a “genuine reason” for owning a firearm. Australia has also pushed “buyback” schemes in recent years. Those who are about to murder, rob, or terrorize are unlikely to be concerned with defying a mere gun law. By criminalizing gun ownership, politicians target law-abiding citizens, depriving them of their ability to protect themselves. In the United States, many cities with the highest homicide rates, like Chicago, Washington, D.C., and New York City, have tight restrictions on gun ownership. For example, in November 2015, Islamic State terrorists carried out an attack at the Bataclan theatre in Paris, murdering 130 people and injuring 400 more. France, like many nations in Europe, has very tough gun laws. Indeed, the Bondi Beach terrorists seemingly used a shotgun and a bolt-action rifle, old designs that have long been out of date and would be considered archaic for any front-line law enforcement or military agency. Neither impeded them from murdering those who lacked the ability to defend themselves. Ultimately, blaming guns distracts from dealing with problems with less tangible solutions, like countering violent extremism and dangerous ideologies. It provides the government with the illusion of doing something meaningful instead of tackling more politically fraught problems. The writer is a Washington D.C.-based foreign affairs analyst.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Denmark's foreign minister said Monday he was “deeply upset” by US President Donald Trump's appointment of a special envoy to Greenland who declared that he wished to see the island become part of the United States. “I am deeply upset by this appointment of a special envoy. And I ‌am particularly upset by his statements, which we find completely unacceptable,” Lars Løkke Rasmussen told Denmark's national broadcaster TV 2, according to Reuters news agency. Rasmussen said he would summon the US ambassador to Denmark in response to the Trump administration's move, Reuters reported. On Sunday, Trump announced the appointment of Jeff Landry, the Governor of Louisiana, as ‌special envoy to Greenland. “Jeff understands how essential Greenland is to our National Security, and will strongly advance our Country's Interests for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Allies, and indeed, the World,” Trump posted on Truth Social. While thanking Trump for his appointment, Landry said it was an “honor to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the U.S.” He also said that “this in no way affects” his position as Louisiana governor. Trump has repeatedly stated that he wants to annex Greenland – a huge, resource-rich island in the Atlantic and self-governing territory of Denmark – claiming that this is needed for American security purposes. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen reiterated their opposition Monday to US plans to take over Greenland, stating “you cannot annex another country. Not even with an argument about international security,” according to Reuters. “Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders and the US shall not take over Greenland,” they said in a joint statement. Nielsen said earlier Monday that Trump's announcement “may sound big, but it does not change anything for us. Vice President JD Vance made a controversial visit to the island in March, repeatedly claiming that it was vulnerable and that the US had “no other option” than to ramp up its presence there. In August, the US envoy to Denmark was summoned by the Danish foreign ministry after the country's public broadcaster reported that several American men had attempted to conduct “influence operations” in Greenland.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lithium-ion batteries are found in everything from smartphones to cars, and while they are generally very safe if stored and charged correctly, there are thousands of documented cases of them catching fire — sometimes with deadly consequences. Lithium-ion batteries contain flammable electrolytes — liquid solutions of lithium salts dissolved in organic solvents that allow the electric charge to flow. The batteries can become unstable under certain conditions, such as physical damage like piercing, overcharging, extreme temperatures or manufacturing defects. Commercial aviation is especially exposed to the problem, because of how ubiquitous battery-powered gadgets are on planes and how dangerous a fire in the cabin or cargo hold can be. In the US, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has long prohibited carrying spare lithium-ion batteries in checked baggage and mandates that all batteries brought into the cabin must remain accessible. The agency recorded 89 battery incidents involving smoke, fire or extreme heat on passenger and cargo aircraft in 2024, and 38 in the first half of 2025. These incidents can lead to the total loss of an aircraft, like the Airbus A321 that was gutted by flames in January in Busan, South Korea. The fire was likely started by a power bank stored in an overhead compartment, according to investigators, which has led some airlines to ban the devices. But the risks of thermal runaways extend to homes, particularly vulnerable to e-bike or e-scooter battery fires, and businesses of all kinds: a survey conducted by insurance provider Aviva in 2024, among over 500 UK businesses found that just over half had experienced an incident linked to lithium-ion batteries, such as sparking, fires and explosions. Now, a team of researchers from The Chinese University of Hong Kong has proposed a change in lithium-ion battery design that could rapidly integrate into current manufacturing methods, because it simply involves swapping chemicals in the existing electrolyte solution. The method was detailed earlier this year in a study led by Yue Sun, now a postdoctoral fellow at Virginia Tech: “I think the most difficult thing for people to realize about batteries is that when you try to optimize performance, sometimes you compromise safety,” she said, explaining that increasing performance requires a focus on chemical reactions that happen at room temperature, while increasing safety focuses on reactions that happen at high temperatures. “So we came up with an idea to break this trade off by designing a temperature-sensitive material, which can provide a good performance at room temperature, but can also offer good stability at high temperatures.” Battery fires generally start when part of the electrolyte breaks down under stress and releases heat in a chain reaction. Sun and her colleagues' design uses a new electrolyte that includes two solvents to stop this chain reaction in its tracks. At room temperature, the first solvent keeps the battery's chemical structure tight, optimizing performance, but if the battery starts to heat up, the second solvent takes over and prevents a fire by loosening that structure and slowing down reactions that could result in a thermal runaway. In lab tests, a battery with this new design that was pierced with a nail saw its temperature rise by only 3.5°C (38.3° Fahrenheit), instead of the 555°C (1,031° Fahrenheit) spike that occurred with a traditional battery. The researchers say there is no negative impact on the battery's performance or durability, and it retained over 80% of its capacity after 1,000 charging cycles. But the electrolyte that we are swapping is a liquid, so you can directly inject it into the cell without any new equipment or new process,” Lu added. Donal Finegan, a senior scientist at the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory, said in an email that the new design is an exciting development, and it translates into a safety battery that can tolerate hot conditions and short circuiting without causing a fire: “The strategically chosen electrolyte solution is scalable and does not significantly impede the cycle life of the battery, which helps eliminate many barriers towards mass adoption in commercial battery systems,” he added. The study explored a range of electrolyte compositions and found options where there was a balance between battery cells lasting many cycles while also maintaining stability at higher temperatures, according to Gary Koenig, a professor of chemical engineering at the University of Virginia. “From a manufacturing perspective, implementing a new electrolyte can be achieved in a relatively short timeframe as long as there is not an unforeseen processing compatibility issue,” he said in an email. Jorge Seminario, a professor of chemical engineering at Texas A&M University, said in an email that the new design addresses one of the most critical challenges in high-energy lithium-ion batteries, which is achieving both safety and performance: “The study is highly innovative and impactful, offering a practical solution to a critical bottleneck in lithium-ion battery safety,” he added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Drenching rain from an atmospheric river-fueled storm triggered deadly flooding and evacuations over the weekend in Northern California. At least one person is dead after flash floods inundated Redding, roughly 150 miles north of Sacramento, according to Redding Mayor Mike Littau, who said police and fire crews carried out water rescues Sunday. Officials have not said how many water rescues were carried out in the city. Shasta County, where Redding is located, was hit particularly hard Sunday evening, with heavy rain flooding multiple roadways, including parts of Interstate 5, according to officials. Mast said they were on their way to a family Christmas gathering but had to turn around because floodwater had washed out part of the road. Shasta County wasn't the only area underwater on Sunday: Crews also performed water rescues in Humboldt County, where the floodwater was chest-deep in some places. Farther east, in Placer County, rising water on the South Yuba River prompted evacuations. Officials issued warnings for multiple properties in Cisco Grove in the Sierra Nevada on Sunday and at least nine people were evacuated from one home there, according to the Placer County Sheriff's Office. More flooding rain, debris flows and rock slides are widespread concerns with this week's multiple storms. Strong winds that could potentially knock out power are also expected. Much of California is under a flood watch until Friday. Heavy, potentially flooding rain will continue to focus on Northern California into Tuesday, especially from the northern Sierra Nevada foothills into the Bay Area. Then another, more widespread storm steps up to the plate. This strong atmospheric river is set to slam the entire state Tuesday night into Wednesday. A Level 3 of 4 flooding rain threat is in place for more than 17 million people in Southern California on Wednesday, including the Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Santa Barbara metros, according to the Weather Prediction Center. Another atmospheric river will be right on its heels, keeping stormy conditions locked in over the state Thursday into Friday. Rainfall totals in Southern California through Saturday could be as much as 4 to 8 inches in coastal and valley locations, while foothills and mountains see 8 to 12 inches. The National Weather Service in Los Angeles warned of significant issues from the upcoming storms, including “widespread urban flooding, mud and debris flows and very hazardous driving conditions.” “START TAKING PROTECTIVE ACTIONS NOW,” the NWS urged Sunday night. Recent wildfire burn areas will be particularly prone to debris flows. Some relief from this nonstop stormy pattern looks to finally arrive for the upcoming weekend.

ATLANTA (AP) — Millennial and Generation Z Christian influencers are increasingly filling a void in American religion, growing audiences across digital platforms by steering young people to biblical answers to tough questions that aren't always answered in Sunday sermons. “I can be that in-between — Monday to Saturday help — to give you practical things to make you feel like you're not walking this walk alone,” said Megan Ashley, 35, sitting cross-legged in sweats on the couch where she records her “In Totality” podcast. From myriad backgrounds, these influencers talk candidly to their listeners about everything from anxieties and doubts to dating and culture, delving into the Bible's complexities. Those of faith say Christian influencers are galvanizing young people looking for meaning in a culture that lacks it at a time when years of declining church attendance has slowed.

(AP Photo/Jessie Wardarski) Ashley and Moore are among a half-dozen popular influencers who described their work for this story. With and without formal theological training, they describe themselves as churchgoers who don't want their messages boxed in by denominational labels. Some grew up in church; others didn't, but they commonly describe experiencing a spiritual transformation that came out of hardship or a sense of emptiness they pin on secular lifestyles. It's OK,” said Arielle Reitsma, 36, co-host of podcast “Girls Gone Bible,” which gets more than a million listens or streams each month.

These algorithm-savvy podcasters fit comfortably in a long tradition of Christian celebrities, said Zachary Sheldon, a Baylor University lecturer on media, religion and culture who cited televangelist Billy Graham as an example. But he pointed to “potential dangers in granting them too much authority on the basis of their celebrity and their acumen with social media.” These influencers encourage church attendance and describe reaching a variety of people, including those who have been particularly disconnected from religion, which polls show is a growing number of young Americans. “People are spiritually hungry, emotionally hungry, and I think for the first time ever … people are encountering Jesus even through online platforms, and they're realizing, this is true life and fulfillment,” said Angela Halili, 29, Reitsma's co-host. At an event in Atlanta, they warned hundreds of fans against idolizing work or relationships, Bibles in hand, and recounted their days as Hollywood actors battling addiction, heartbreak and mental health disorders. Halili said God brought them “radical healing,” and they want listeners to know that God can perform “miracles” in their lives, too. Afterward, they hugged and prayed for people in the audience, where Anna Williams, 17, said she considers both Reitsma and Halili to be “a big sister” in her life. God “does make everything better, but that doesn't always come in the way that we think it's gonna come,” said “In Totality” host Ashley. She said her intensity grew after a healing encounter with God's “severity” as a freshly divorced single mom plagued by suicidal thoughts and depression. Bible themes, heavier challenges, day-to-day plights as well as topics like parenting and Black culture are covered on “With the Perrys,” a podcast led by husband and wife authors and spoken-word artists who also run a streetwear brand. “It is the all — how do we do all of this stuff in this weird flesh and weird world?” said Jackie Hill Perry, 36. She is an admired speaker who is working towards her seminary degree and wrote a book about leaving behind same-sex relationships. At just 22, Bryce Crawford teaches Bible chapters on his self-named podcast and posts videos of himself talking to people about Christianity at Pride parades, the Burning Man counter-culture festival and a satanic temple.

(Divij Vaswani via AP) Rather than shout “repent,” Crawford's street evangelism aims to change minds through kindness. His followers say they're attracted by his empathetic yet bold demeanor while delivering talking points against lifestyles such as same-sex marriage. “My issue with ‘repent or burn in hell' is that people get frustrated because they don't know why you're telling them that,” said Crawford, who describes being severely anxious and bitter toward God until God healed him at a Waffle House. “Our tactics have been one-on-one conversations, calmly listening, asking questions because we care about them, and in that explaining our worldview.” These influencers acknowledge that online Christianity has its challenges. A hyperfocus on online drama and Christianity's more esoteric beliefs can miss the basics, such as love and Christ's sacrifice, Hill Perry said. Some followers say these influencers provide a welcome alternative to the buttoned-up pastors they grew up with who spoke of God as a faraway deity that would reject them for breaking too many rules. She's involved with her church and likes her pastor, but feels like these influencers are like “one of the girls … walking out the faith with you.”</p>
