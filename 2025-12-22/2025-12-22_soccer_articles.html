                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vinicius, who narrowly missed out on the Ballon d'Or in 2024, is working on a deal at Santiago Bernabeu that is due to run until 2027. Lucrative terms would be on offer there, with Real being warned off trying to match said proposals. They are being urged to cash in on the South American while his price tag remains high, with there little value to be found in paying him the kind of figures that current ‘Galactico' Mbappe and Argentine GOAT Messi pull in. Former Real striker and director Predrag Mijatovic has spoken out against Vinicius on a regular basis of late. He has now told Carrusel Deportivo of future talks in the Spanish capital: “If he is now asking for the same contract as Mbappe or Messi, it is clear that he does not want to renew; that is obvious. And if he wants to finish his contract at Real Madrid, that's fine. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Interested parties may begin to sound Vinicius out in the new year if it becomes apparent that no terms will be thrashed out in Madrid. Big-spending teams in Saudi Arabia are expected to lead that chase. He added on more top talent being lured to an ambitious sporting project, with several big names having already trodden that path: “Foreign players have always been part of Saudi teams. Benzema, among others, create a bigger impact, both nationally and internationally.” Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Vinicius is in the Middle East at present, having jetted off to Dubai after seeing Real reach their winter break. He left Spain immediately after being taunted by his own supporters in a 2-0 victory over Sevilla - he was replaced in that contest late on. The Brazilian has registered just five goals and eight assists through 24 appearances in all competitions this season. With supporters jeering him on home soil, exit speculation has been ramped up. He is no longer considered to be indispensable, with Mbappe now very much the leading man in Madrid while the likes of Jude Bellingham and Rodrygo fill support roles.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Santos have offered an update on his condition and an update on when he is expected to be fit again has been provided. Neymar has been blighted by injury issues in recent years and has undergone another operation after suffering knee problems during his time back at Santos. The Brazil star has undergone an arthroscopy which is not expected to sideline him for too long, meaning his World Cup dreams remain alive. The Brazilian superstar returned to Santos in January, after a dismal time in Saudi Arabia with Al-Hilal, and played a key role in keeping the team up. These have been tough weeks for me," Neymar said after his team beat the drop. If it weren't for them, I wouldn't have played these matches because of these injuries, this knee problem. I need to rest and then we will have this knee surgery." Santos have now confirmed Neymar has undergone successful surgery: "The player Neymar da Silva Santos Junior underwent surgery this Monday morning (12/22) at Mater Dei Nova Lima by Dr. Rodrigo Lasmar and his team. An arthroscopy was performed to treat a lesion in the medial meniscus. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Neymar is expected to miss around a month of action, meaning he is due back at the end of January/early February, according to ESPN. Before that game, Santos are due to face Novorizontino, Palmeiras and Guarani. Santos president Marcelo Teixeira has told ESPN he expects Neymar to continue: "Neymar's project is a project for next year's World Cup. Maybe we imagined taking advantage of it more in the first half of the year and we couldn't, but it's nobody's fault. Neymar's participation continues to be important, off the field and on it. We are evaluating the numbers and extending these values. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Neymar will now be hoping to make a full and swift recovery from his knee problem and return to playing football. The Brazilian has readily admitted he dreams of playing at World Cup 2026 but still has work to do to convince manager Carlo Ancelotti he deserves a place in his squad. He told reporters earlier this month: "If we talk about Neymar, we have to talk about other players. We have to think about Brazil, which can be with Neymar or without Neymar, with other players or without other players. I understand very well that they are very interested in Neymar, I want to clarify that we are in December, the World Cup is in June, I will choose the team that will go to the World Cup in May. If Neymar deserves to be, if he is well, better than someone else, he will play in the World Cup and period. I don't owe anyone a debt."</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Liverpool forward Takumi Minamino is now facing doubts over his involvement for Japan at the World Cup after a crushing injury blow to Wataru Endo‘s teammate. Minamino has been a key player for Monaco since his £15.5 million move from Liverpool in 2022, as well as a consistent starter for Hajime Moriyasu's Japan. But he is now expected to miss the remainder of the season and likely the 2026 World Cup after suffering an ACL injury on Sunday. Minamino is now expected to miss six to nine months of action, which will rule him out of the rest of Monaco's campaign and, if his recovery is at the longer end of the scale, also Japan's involvement at the World Cup. It will be a major blow to Japan, with Minamino starting nine of their 14 qualifiers and scoring four goals along the way. He has started five of their last six games – all friendlies – and captained his country in three of those, netting in a famous 3-2 victory over Brazil as well as in a 2-0 win over Ghana in November. His absence will also be a loss for Endo, who is still Japan captain and, despite losing his place in recent games, will almost certainly play a key role in the USA, Mexico and Canada. Endo and Minamino have played together on 50 occasions, winning 37 of those, and they are among the most experienced players in Moriyasu's regular squad. Japan will play the Netherlands, Tunisia and one of Ukraine, Sweden, Poland or Albania in Group F of the World Cup. It will be their seventh consecutive appearance at the tournament – and their seventh in history – with their best achievement so far being a place in the last 16 on four occasions including in 2022.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If that predication proves to be correct, then transfer talk surrounding the England international striker will quieten quickly. He has seen a return to the Premier League mooted, while also being linked with Barcelona, but is fully focused on events in Germany for the foreseeable future. Kane stepped out of his comfort zone when leaving Tottenham for the Allianz Arena in 2023. He bid farewell to north London as Spurs' all-time leading scorer and has maintained remarkable individual standards at Bayern. A second Bundesliga Golden Boot was collected last season when finding the target on 41 occasions in all competitions. Kane also lifted his trophy curse when becoming a title winner in Germany. He has savoured a Super Cup success since then and has Champions League glory in his sights for 2026 - alongside a World Cup quest as captain of his country. The 32-year-old's current contract is due to run until 2027, but it has been revealed that exit clauses in those terms can be triggered in upcoming transfer windows - with an offer of £57 million ($77m) enough to enter into talks. Another legendary Bundesliga goalscorer, Klaus Fischer, believes that the fearsome No.9 will stick around in his current surroundings.

Kane has told his Cleats Club channel of being “honoured” to receive that accolade. Now we have the extraordinary good fortune to experience him daily at FC Bayern – three words aren't enough, but if I had to narrow it down: down-to-earth, world-class, game-changer – and all of that applies at every level.” Kane has hit 19 Bundesliga goals this season, leaving him on course to chase down Lewandowski's record tally of 41 from 2020-21. Lewandowski wasn't the type of player who worked so hard defensively. “Kane is sometimes deployed as a backup to Nicolas Jackson when he comes on as a substitute, and he also frequently operates in midfield, winning the ball and distributing it. I believe he has a chance to break the goalscoring record this season. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Kane has told Sky Sport Germany of his bid to earn another entry in the history books: “I think it's possible, especially with the start I've had so far this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tyler Adams walks off injured while facing Manchester United; Weston McKennie in action against Roma Robin Jones / Getty Images; Image Photo Agency With Tyler Adams possibly out until March, thoughts turned to whether other candidates can seriously challenge for his place before the World Cup warm-up games. Bournemouth struggled without Adams on Saturday as their winless Premier League streak stretched to eight games in a 1-1 draw with Burnley. The American midfielder's absence would hurt any team but it remains unclear how long he will be out with a medial knee ligament injury. But even if the 26-year-old gets fit quickly, USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino will be assessing his depth in defensive midfield positions. Unfortunately, this weekend left Pochettino little fresh evidence to analyse. He knows all about Aidan Morris' potential, having fielded the 24-year-old in wins over Australia, Paraguay and Uruguay. Yet a leg injury meant he missed his fifth consecutive game at the weekend and although he is not expected to be out much longer, it has paused his impressive progress in the Championship, English soccer's second tier, since moving to Middlesbrough from Columbus Crew in the summer of 2024. Tessmann had a lively 12 minutes for Lyon after coming off the bench in their comfortable 3-0 Coupe de France win over seventh-tier Saint-Cyr Collonges au Mont d'Or on Sunday. Tessmann created a good chance that saw Afonso Moreira's shot saved, and had an effort of his own kept out. But it is Cardoso's status at Atletico Madrid that may cause concern. The 24-year-old has lost his place in Diego Simeone's team, being reduced to just 14 minutes as a substitute across the last seven La Liga games in which he has been fit. Injury has also hampered him, with an ankle problem ruining the opening phase of his season. Conversely, the evidence continues to be positive about the national team's attacking potency in wide areas — even if there is less depth than in central midfield. Antonee Robinson played his second full game for Fulham on Wednesday. Although they lost 2-1 against Newcastle United, the left-back was looking like his old self after finally overcoming a complex knee problem; he created the visitor's goal with a mixture of vision and accurate delivery to tee up Sasa Lukic. Quality assists have arrived in his two most recent Eredivisie games for PSV, and the run and pass to set up USMNT teammate Ricardo Pepi against Utrecht on Sunday was scintillating. You'd struggle to find too many flaws in Chris Richards' performances for Crystal Palace under Oliver Glasner. The defender has become a valued part of their prized three-man defence alongside Marc Guehi and Maxence Lacroix. He should have dealt better with a long throw into the area before Leeds' first goal. It was a mixed evening for Gio Reyna on his return to Borussia Dortmund. Borussia Monchengladbach lost 2-0 at his former team on Friday, but the USMNT playmaker made a fourth consecutive start. There was a flash of his mercurial ability early on when he nutmegged close friend Felix Nmecha, and afterward, Reyna told ESPN he is getting sharper. I had an injury at the beginning of the year and the club has taken care of me and built me up to where I can start games and be fit for pretty much as long as I can.” As ever, it doesn't matter where Juventus play Weston McKennie: full-back, central midfield, out wide or behind the striker. He has been deployed almost everywhere for the Serie A giants and keeps contributing. On Saturday, he played on the right flank and created Juve's second goal in a 2-1 win over Roma, moving them to within a point of the fourth-placed visitors. McKennie's 70th-minute header at goal brought a great initial save from Mile Svilar, but the Roma goalkeeper spilled the ball and Lois Openda buried it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GOAL runs the rule over the British players earning a living away from their homeland, with plenty more stars deciding to leave their comfort zones in search of a better footballing life elsewhere. The Premier League is still obviously one of the world's most entertaining divisions and the Championship can prove fantastic for development, but there are more options out there. There were stellar performances from two of England's best players, while there is a cup final between two Scotsmen to be played on a different continent altogether. Every Monday this season, GOAL brings you the latest on British stars abroad, what they're getting up to, who is reaching the greatest heights and who needs to come home. It feels like Harry Kane shatters a new record every weekend, but there was some significance to his antics on Sunday. That's par for the course for golf-fanatic Kane, but this was his 100th contribution in the Bundesliga - a split of 81 goals and 19 assists - in 78 games, becoming the quickest player to reach that milestone in the competition's history, while he ends 2025 with 60 goals in all competitions. Kane was also handed the captain's armband for the first time at Bayern, with regular skippers Manuel Neuer and Joshua Kimmich both sitting this match out. Bayern are halfway to an unbeaten domestic season and lead the Bundesliga by nine points from second-placed Borussia Dortmund. On a personal note delighted to lead the boys out as captain and reach 100 goal contributions in the Bundesliga. In the second half, we missed a lot of chances, and Heidenheim also had some good opportunities, where Jonas [Urbig] made a few good saves. "I won my first team trophy in the summer, which was very special," he added, reflecting on 2025. "We also gained a lot of energy as a team at the Club World Cup, and that's hard to break. Real Madrid were made to work by Sevilla for their 2-0 win in La Liga on Saturday, with an anxious Bernabeu crowd at least seeing their side take the three points as an early Christmas present. It was quite the slog to victory from there, however, with supporters getting on the back of several players, including Vinicius Jr, before Kylian Mbappe's 86th-minute penalty put daylight between the two sides. "Nice way to end 2025 but we have to be better in 2026," Bellingham said in an Instagram post after ending a run of seven games without a goal. "Madridistas, through the good and bad thank you for all your support this year!" Conor Gallagher has been in and out of the Atletico Madrid starting line up all season long, though it appears his most useful role is coming off the bench having now scored all three of his goals this term as a substitute. MARCA described Gallagher, who replaced the injured Nico Gonzalez on the 28-minute mark, as 'omnipresent' in Atletico's attacks, crediting his forward-thinking performance despite the perception that Diego Simeone's substitution was a negative one. Nevertheless, this was still an impressive cameo for a man who is trying to do all he can to work his way back into Thomas Tuchel's thinking ahead of England's World Cup campaign. Though Atletico and Real won this weekend, both Madrid clubs still trail La Liga leaders Barcelona by nine and four points, respectively, after the reigning champions beat Villarreal on Sunday. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting There'll be a particularly British flavour to Monday's Suppercoppa Italiana final between Napoli and Bologna, with Scott McTominay's Serie A champions facing the Coppa Italia winners, who boast the presence of Lewis Ferguson and Jonathan Rowe. Antonio Conte's kings of Italy advanced to the showpiece event in Riyadh after beating AC Milan 2-0 on Thursday, but the Rossoblu's semi-final was not quite as straightforward. They came from a goal down to draw 1-1 with Inter, sending the tie to a penalty shootout. Five spot kicks were missed in total between the two sides, but Ferguson and Rowe both scored from 12 yards to send Bologna through. Ferguson, Bologna's captain, has struggled for consistent game time this season, though head coach Vincenzo Italiano has insisted this has been due to fitness issues rather than for any overriding tactical reasons, and is hopeful the midfielder can lead the club to another trophy after playing a major role in helping Scotland qualify for the World Cup. "It's not a matter of minutes or fitness. He's alternating matches of great focus and quality with others that are less sharp. When he goes away with the national team, he performs at a very high level; here, it's a bit of an up-and-down period. He's also coming off some minor knee issues." Compatriot McTominay, meanwhile, will be hoping to get his hands on more silverware at his international team-mate's expense, who has been hailed as the strongest player in Italy ahead of the final. Sam Beukema, who joined Napoli from Bologna over the summer, told Serie A's YouTube channel: "I have to say my friend Scott. Marseille sailed into the last 32 of the Coupe de France with an emphatic 6-0 win away at third-tier side Bourg-Peronnas. Fellow Manchester United academy graduate Angel Gomes, who has already been linked with an exit despite only joining the club in the summer, grabbed an assist as a timely reminder of his quality. Despite the final scoreline showing a clear difference in class, De Zerbi was slightly critical of his players for their defending. We conceded too many scoring opportunities," he said during his post-match press conference. "But we played well, a serious match, approached with the right mindset. We know that in the Coupe de France there can be surprises. We won 6-0, but it was only 1-0 at half-time." I told them to come back on December 28 for the resumption of training fully motivated because that will be necessary for January." On Sunday, he captained a senior team for the first time in his career, donning the armband as OL beat semi-professional outfit Saint-Cyr Collonges 3-0 in their own Coupe de France tie. Maitland-Niles was restored to the starting XI and given the captaincy after returning from suspension for a red card picked up in a loss to Lorient a fortnight ago. Despite this, he remains a favourite among Lyon fans and has been welcomed back into the fold with open arms.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac have sold another stake in Wrexham, but the Red Dragons - and their new investors - are expected to have Hollywood co-owners locked in “golden handcuffs”. Their value to the collective cause is not lost on anybody connected with the Welsh club, with a meteoric rise to prominence being enjoyed under A-list chairmen. Reynolds and Mac completed their stunning takeover at the Racecourse Ground in 2021. Commercial revenue has soared as a brand is built to rival Premier League, European and MLS heavyweights. Reynolds and Mac no longer boast complete control at Wrexham. They have previously entered into a partnership with the wealthy Allyn family, while Apollo Sports Capital now own a 10 per cent share of the second tier outfit. If they were to move on, then serious questions would be asked of how interest can be retained while pushing towards the top flight of English football. The reason why Wrexham sell 100,000 shirts a year is that a huge proportion of those are to people who are fans of the Welcome to Wrexham documentary. “If you take away Reynolds and Mac, will those people continue to have the same degree of enthusiasm for Wrexham? “I would imagine that Apollo and the other American investors probably have some form of golden handcuffs agreement with Reynolds and Mac, which says that you've got to commit to your involvement with the club for at least the next five years, because we might want to extract value going forwards." He added, with it already being announced that ‘Welcome to Wrexham' will be back for Season 5 in 2026: “If they get promoted to the Premier League, you've got another series of the programme and that part of the fairy tale is able to continue.” Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. There are needs that require a certain type of skill and people who have some experience in growing things. “We chose the Allyn family because they have similar values that make Wrexham. They've been revitalising towns and communities for many years in upstate New York, and that's why bringing them on didn't cause a big stir.” Reynolds and Mac said in a joint statement when announcing the deal struck with Apollo - who are already associated with La Liga giants Atletico Madrid: “From day one, we wanted to build a sustainable future for Wrexham Association Football Club and to do it with a little heart and humour.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Soccer fans around the world pushed back this month after FIFA unveiled 2026 World Cup prices that would set ticket holders back thousands of dollars. Shock turned into outrage as fans accused the organization of betrayal. Tickets for matches that should have cost less than $100 shot up past $4,000, leaving fans and host cities in the United States, Mexico, and Canada fuming. U.S. fans, eager to have a front-row seat at one of the world's most prestigious sporting events, have complained they are being priced out because they can't afford the high ticket prices. In a Dec. 17, 2025, speech that focused heavily on the topic, Trump claimed to be making progress. The number of $60 tickets for each game is likely to be from 400 to 740 per team, in what FIFA is now calling a “Supporter Entry Tier” price category. “If the cheapest seats are scarce, restricted to limited matches, or buried behind presales and packages, the headline number reads like a public relations patch rather than a meaningful change. She added that a significant part of the FIFA backlash centers on predictability and trust. “Football has long sold itself as the people's game, and the World Cup has been treated as a once-in-a-lifetime event that ordinary fans can still reach with planning and sacrifice,” she said. “When ticket pricing feels opaque, dynamic, or tilted toward corporate buyers, fans start to think they are being priced out by design. “FIFA can point at $60 tickets, but resale data shows that for the vast majority of fans, the realistic cost to attend meaningful World Cup matches will be far higher,” he said. “Based on what we are seeing in the resale market, FIFA has not done enough to ease affordability concerns. While low-priced tickets technically exist, they make up a very small share of inventory and are often limited to a handful of very low-demand matches or early release windows. For nearly all group stage games and knockout rounds, prices are already signaling a much higher barrier to entry than the sport's long-standing affordability narrative suggests.” “Without greater transparency around low price inventory, expanded price-capped sections, market pricing will continue to define public perception regardless of FIFA's messaging,” he added. One defense FIFA has floated for its high ticket prices is that they reflect the North American market. If FIFA adopts those norms, it imports the same frustrations,” she said. Another defense of FIFA's high prices was its not-for-profit designation. The organization said it reinvests 90% of its revenue into global soccer development and needs to capture value from the massive demand, especially with open resale markets. “People generally accept that FIFA reinvests revenue into football development, but they still question what portion of revenue depends on squeezing fans,” Tsukerman said. “A nonprofit can still behave in ways that feel extractive, especially when executive pay, event costs, and sponsorship structures appear far removed from the everyday supporter. The issue is not whether FIFA spends money somewhere beneficial. Jeff Le, a soccer enthusiast and managing principal at 100 Mile Strategies, told the Washington Examiner that the backlash, not only in ticket prices but also in expensive hotel rates across North America, could do real damage to the World Cup. Le said that Trump's “close embrace of FIFA” also makes World Cup success a political priority. “Cyber concerns could impact both North America's critical infrastructure as well as make World Cup attendees vulnerable to hospitality scams and other cybercrime,” he added.</p>
