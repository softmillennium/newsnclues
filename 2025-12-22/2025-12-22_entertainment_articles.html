Turner Classic Movies (TCM) is set to honor the life and career of beloved late filmmaker Rob Reiner with a newly-announced programming tribute next month. On January 28, 2026, the network will host a full evening of Reiner's work, including four of his most popular films, headlined by a special premiere presentation of “The Princess Bride,” which has not been previously available on the network. Per a press release about the event, “‘The Princess Bride' endures as one of Reiner's most beloved achievements — celebrated for its wit, emotional sincerity, and timeless storytelling that continues to resonate with audiences across generations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. There are movies that you love in part because of the memories you hold of them, from childhood favorites that are practically imprinted in your brain to blockbusters improved by a particularly amazing screening. Less talked about is the opposite: films you hate because they're attached in some way to a moment or experience you want to forget. Tim Burton's “Alice in Wonderland” is a horrible movie, yes, but I probably would not feel as strongly repulsed by it had I not first seen it in theaters with a 110-degree fever and spent the last 20 minutes puking my guts out in the bathroom. But no film looms over this writer's life as largely as “Cast Away,” Robert Zemeckis' survival drama about Tom Hanks getting stranded on a deserted island, which I also never actually watched the whole way through until well into adulthood. Related Stories ‘The Americas' Narrator Tom Hanks Would Trade ‘Dad' Nickname for ‘The Best Park Ranger They've Ever Heard' Mia Threapleton Struggled  to Focus on ‘The Phoenician Scheme' Opposite Tom Hanks: ‘It's Bloody Woody‘ You can probably understand where we're going here. I was born in 1999, a year before “Cast Away” hit theaters on December 22, 2000. In a “Sliding Doors” moment I think about quite often, my parents had two names they were still debating upon my birth: the very conventional George and the somewhat less-so Wilson. Family legend (or perhaps Mom and Dad trying to shift some blame) has it that it was one of the neonatal nurses who convinced them to go with Wilson. The name itself, according to a phone call with my mother I took while writing this essay, came indirectly from her family tree: it was the name of a friend and business partner of my great-great-grandfather (or maybe great-great-great? We don't really remember), one my grandmother suggested. Hanks decorates the ball with a smeared bloody red handprint to give him a friend of sorts on the island, and uses him to conveniently talk through his thoughts for the audience's sake. I first became aware of “Cast Away” when I was around 7 years old, at the Maine house of family friends my parents took me to visit one summer. On their living room TV, I sat through a random 30 minutes or so before I changed the channel to Cartoon Network because “Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew” was playing. I do remember vaguely thinking it was funny and cool that the volleyball shared my name, and I did witness The Scene. The climactic moment in which Chuck takes a raft out to sea to try and escape the island, only for Wilson the volleyball to fall off his vessel and float away, leaving a heartbroken Chuck to bellow, at the top of his lungs, “Willllsooooooooon!” in a cadence that is both extremely memorable and extremely imitable. Apparently, 7 years old is the prime age to introduce your kids to “Cast Away,” because that following school year was also when I started to become aware of my classmates — and some adults who thought it was fun to tease an elementary schooler — greeting me with their best Hanks' impression. The first time I heard it, I probably thought it was funny: the tenth and twentith and two-hundreth time? Getting the “Willllsoooooon” yell at me in the hallway of school, at summer camp, when I was introducing myself to new people, became a constant I always had to expect and prepare for. It also, annoyingly, did not stop after fifth grade or even eighth grade, continuing through high school and well into college. As you can imagine, people using your name as a punchline, no matter how benign or harmless, isn't exactly a positive experience for an admittedly thin-skinned and insecure child/teen to deal with. It made me hate the name to the point where I went through an angsty, overdramatic phase during which I considered changing it. I tried occasionally to make a nickname stick, but people always told me “your name is perfect for you,” presumably because I was the only person with the first name that they had actually met. If anyone were to ask pretentious teenage me in high school, I would have told them that “Cast Away” is one of the worst films ever made, an overly sentimental and vacuous bore that deserved none of the $429 million it made at the box office. Yes, I was basing this off of 30 minutes I half-remembered seeing during my childhood, but I had a grudge against this film, Robert Zemeckis, and sort of Tom Hanks (“Toy Story” and “That Thing You Do!” were enough to elevate him to thin ice), and was too stubborn to ever budge against it. Of course, once you get to real adulthood, yelling “Willlllsoooooooon” at someone you just met becomes significantly less socially acceptable, and slowly the references trickled to a crawl. They never completely stopped, and choosing to go into writing about movies for a living did not exactly help, but it became an occasional annoyance instead of a constant. About two years ago, on a random weekday evening, I decided to take a step that I had refused for years. I was going to actually sit down and watch the film people had associated my name with for my entire life. I typically go into every movie trying to keep an open mind, but I did not have pure intentions here: the stubborn part of me wanted it to be bad. Instead, like many people who watch “Cast Away,” I cried. Actually, really watching Zemeckis' film, I found a movie that's a lot more raw and stripped-down than I was expecting from him (not to denigrate the man who gave us “Who Framed Roger Rabbit”), with little of the sentimentality that sometimes overburdens his productions. So when the “Willllsoooon” moment hit, despite having heard that moment quoted back to me more times than I can ever possibly count, I found myself surprisingly moved by it. And yet, in the context of the movie, it doesn't feel like it at all — between the stirring Alan Silvestri score that plays and Hanks' performance, which goes all out in depicting his sadness at losing Wilson as real, deeply devastating grief, the scene manages to transcend any sense of silliness to be fully emotionally enveloping. Watching it made me vaguely annoyed that a film scene so good could be reduced to just a cheap joke my whole life. And while having my name turn into a movie reference the year after I was born may not have been exactly ideal, I can choose to look on the bright side: my name is one people have always immediately remembered. I have Tom Hanks and a very special volleyball to thank for that. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sandfall Interactive's indie status has already been put into question by many, owing to its AAA prestige and team size in a field where many independent games are made by under 10 people, but it qualified for the IGA's awards until its use of generative AI was revealed. Screenshots close to launch in April showed a pillar covered in posters with generated text and images, which were quietly patched out shortly after release. Unlike The Alters, which used gen AI for both placeholders and some subtitles, Clair Obscur went under the radar with its usage, despite disclosing that they used “some, not much” gen AI when speaking to Spanish periodical El País in July. The IGA made a staunch commitment against any gen AI usage in its nominees, stipulating that “games developed using generative AI are strictly ineligible for nomination” in their eligibility FAQ. In a statement posted on their social media, Six One Indie's creative director Mike Towndrow said “despite agreeing that no gen AI was used in the making of the game when it was submitted to us for consideration, unfortunately that's not the case. That clearly goes against the regulations we have in place and disqualifies it from nomination.” The new winners have been contacted and will provide acceptance speeches when feasible. Towndrow went on to disqualify one of their Indie Vanguards, Gorytn Code, as their game Chantey is being distributed and produced solely by ModRetro, founded by arms dealer Palmer Luckey. ModRetro had made headlines prior in the week after unveiling the Anduril edition of their Chromatic handheld, made with metal also used in Luckey's attack drones of the same name as a selling point. In an update to the El País article, Sandfall asserted that although the AI generated placeholder accidentally shipped in the final game, it was a product of “brief” experimentation with the new technology in 2022 and that currently “there are no generative AI-created assets” in Clair Obscur. In a time where we can only go on the word of developers and the scrutiny of consumers, Sandfall's statement here is as good as we can get.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: In a year that was heavy with horror, for a minute it appeared as though Blumhouse and Atomic Monster were on a stale streak, particularly when sequel M3GAN 2.0 didn't live up to the blockbuster status of the first 2023 film. That's the first time as a combined company that the Blumhouse and Atomic Monster slate has made more than $1B. Blumhouse and Atomic Monster's merger was made official in January 2024. The previous best box office year was 2023, with four Blumhouse movies —Insidious: Red Door, M3GAN, Five Nights at Freddy's and Black Phone— raking in $821.9M. Here's how this all breaks down as some of the titles aren't with Blumhouse's home distributor Universal. It's also the only Conjuring movie to have grossed north of $400M WW. The Patrick Wilson-Vera Farmiga starring, Michael Chaves directed R-rated horror movie reps 48% of Blumhouse-Atomic Monster's 2025. Last Rites launched in the post-Labor Day weekend which Warner Bros has turned into a rich launch pad for horror films going back to 2017's It. Second, pushing the Jason Blum and James Wan label over $1 billion, is Universal's Five Nights at Freddy's 2 with $201.8M global, $108.9M of that made domestically. The sequel, also directed by Emma Tammi, went pure theatrical instead of theatrical day and date on Peacock like the 2023 movie. 1 opening stateside of the year ($27.3M), behind Conjuring Last Rites (best in franchise with $84M) and Five Nights at Freddy's 2 ($64M, a record opening for any movie in the post Thanksgiving/early December frame). All in the Black Phone franchise counts $293.5M. Black Phone 2 opened on Oct. 17 and it repped actor Ethan Hawke's fourth collaboration with Derrickson after the Sinister series. Fourth is NEON's The Monkey based on the Stephen King short story and directed by Oz Perkins, which grossed $68.8M global ($39.9M domestic). The movie opened on Feb. 21 and followed twin brothers Bill and Hal who find their father's old monkey toy in the attic. While M3GAN 2.0 didn't work at $39M global ($24.1M domestic) next to the original's hot $180M, it still gets Blumhouse and Atomic Monster to big numbers for the year. Leigh Whannell's Wolf Man was next with $34.1M worldwide ($20.7M domestic), followed by the Brandon Sklenar and Meghann Fahy starring April 11 date thriller, Drop, with $28.7M WW ($16.6M domestic), while Woman in the Yard after a March 28 theatrical release grossed $23.3M (96% of that made stateside). First release for Blumhouse and Atomic Monster in the New Year is Lee Cronin's The Mummy via New Line on April 17. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amy Schumer is offering a rare and candid look at how she and her family are coping after confirming her separation from husband Chris Fischer, emphasizing the role of humor and togetherness even when life feels hard. The comedian's heartfelt reflections came as she celebrated the final night of Hanukkah, turning a moment of personal challenge into an honest and relatable message about resilience. During a Hanukkah celebration shared on Instagram by author and activist Noa Tishby, Schumer spoke openly about how her family leans on humor to get through tough times. The holiday season — which often centers on warmth, light and reflection — offered Schumer a backdrop to express both her faith and her gratitude. Schumer also spoke about the importance of Jewish pride and community during challenging times, describing it as “the only way to fight against antisemitism.” In a separate post to her Instagram Story, Schumer shared a quote by author Hannah Rosenberg that touched on the power of friendships and support networks. The message celebrated the significance of deep bonds with loved ones — friendships that offer both laughter and strength when facing hardship. “My life is filled with the souls of women I love… who show up on my doorstep to celebrate and grieve,” the excerpt read. Schumer's choice to share the quote underscored her belief in community and connection during periods of difficulty. Schumer, 44, confirmed earlier this month that she and Fischer, 45, are ending their seven-year marriage — a decision she described as amicable and rooted in mutual respect. She also asked for privacy as they navigate this transition. Their separation comes after years of public and private milestones, including collaborations on “Amy Schumer Learns to Cook” and the HBO docuseries “Expecting Amy.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last December after Luigi Mangione was arrested for the murder of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson, headlines from publications like CBS, People, and Newsweek shouted that his own mother had implicated him in the crime. The headlines came after NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny held a press conference a week after Mangione's arrest in which he said Kathleen Mangione told law enforcement the crime “might be something that she could see him doing.” However, there hasn't been any evidence Mangione's mother ever said this to law enforcement. Mangione's lead defense attorney Karen Friedman Agnifilo brought the comments up last week on the final day of his suppression hearings in New York City. She asked either the New York Police Department, the San Francisco police department, or the Manhattan district attorney's office to “correct this very prejudicial statement that was never said.” (Mangione has pleaded not guilty to all state and federal charges against him.) The SFPD, who had conversations with Mangione's mother when she filed a missing person's request for him in November 2024, has so far stayed quiet about these comments attributed to her. Horan was looking through Mangione's social media photos while investigating a missing person's case filed by Mangione's mother, Kathleen, who lives in Maryland. (He detailed this surprising discovery in a conversation with Rolling Stone last spring.) In an interview with Rolling Stone on Friday, Horan says he and his colleagues never spoke with Mangione's mother at all after he identified Mangione as resembling the UHC shooter. Horan says the only Mangione family member the SFPD spoke with once Horan raised his suspicions was one of Mangione's sisters, and they did not mention during that conversation anything about the crime photos that were circulating. “We were just kind of curious if she would have volunteered it, since [the crime photos were] all over the news, but it just never came up,” Horan says. It's unclear where NYPD Chief of Detectives Kenny received this information that Kathleen supposedly said she could see her son “doing something like that.” (The NYPD did not respond to requests for comment.) During his 2024 press conference,  Kenny also said, “Part of that vetting process was that they reached out to Mangione's mother in San Francisco, very late on the seventh.

Luigi Mangione's Lawyer Slams Prosecutors for ‘Illegally' Recording His Interrogation ‘It's F-cking Him, One Hundred Percent,' Cop Said After Finding Bullets in Luigi Mangione's Backpack Luigi Mangione's Alleged Checklist of Plans for Days Following Shooting Released Kenny added that the information they'd gathered would be passed along to detectives “the next morning” — which would have been Dec. 8 — but Mangione was apprehended before they could act on it. Horan reiterated to Rolling Stone that he doesn't know the specific details of Kathleen Mangione's conversation with the FBI over that December 2024 weekend.

I just enjoy her being my brother's soon-to-be wife, and aunt to my kids, and we try to leave that relationship where it should be, there,” he says. “Watching her operate, watching her savviness in getting her entire music catalogue back, watching how she has toured the globe while also writing an entire new album, the level at which she takes control over a lot of different aspects but also allowing people to be experts in their own right, I think that a lot of that stuff is fun to watch,” he explains.

And the leap of faith that was being made in an unmapped, uncharted world.” Recently, Nolan released the six-minute prologue for The Odyssey in select IMAX theaters ahead of screenings of Sinners, One Battle After Another, and James Cameron's Avatar: Fire and Ash.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"You walk out changed": The intimate venue has launched careers from Garth Brooks to Taylor Swift — and continues to define Nashville's songwriting culture. People have tried bribing their way into The Bluebird Cafe. For an independent venue tucked away in a Nashville strip mall, The Bluebird has folks trying to get in at all hours of the day just to get a peak at the storied space that has been instrumental in the careers of giants like Garth Brooks, Taylor Swift and many more. “I would be counting money on a Sunday morning and people would be banging on the door having to get in,” says Bluebird Cafe COO and GM Erika Wollam Nichols. “When I wouldn't let them in, they came around the back and started waiving $20 bills at me and I'm like, ‘No! The enthusiasm would seem outsized for an 86-capacity club five miles outside of downtown Nashville that hasn't seen much renovation beyond sound system upgrades and regularly changing the carpet. But – like many independent venues that have survived the turbulent live music industry for more than four decades – its allure is in the lore. Before any stars graced the stage, The Bluebird Cafe was a 100-seat restaurant opened by Amy Kurland in a former drugstore turned poolhall in 1982. According to Wollam Nichols (who worked as a waitress at the cafe during her years at university), Kurland's “goal was to make good food, but she also loved music.” Kurland's father was an established violinist who created a group of string players for hire in Nashville and helped instill in Amy a love and appreciation for hardworking musicians. The Bluebird's small stage helped local artists be seen and, on the cafe's first anniversary, the first musician who regularly appeared there secured a deal with Mercury Records. “And it was like, ‘wait a minute, something is going on here with this.' Soon after that, The Bluebird moved to hosting simply acoustic shows – two shows a night, seven nights a week. Wollam Nichols explains, “You wouldn't be able to talk quite as easily if everybody is sitting at your elbow.” And the now legendary In The Round sessions began. They are a little bit unnerved,” Wollam Nichols says. “Then the music starts, and they start to become drawn into that experience, and they walk out changed. People will say, ‘I've never heard music like this ever before. This is the greatest experience I've ever had at a show in my life.' That experience is expertly curated by The Bluebird staff that started hosting auditions back in 1984 to ensure only songwriters who could hold a crowd sat in the middle of the room. Auditions are held four times a year on a Sunday morning with roughly 60 songwriters who come to see a panel of judges including Bluebird staff, label folks, publishers, professional songwriters and theater people. Songwriters have one minute to impress the panel. “The structure of it was something that Amy created because she felt like after a minute of a song, if you didn't like it, you would change the radio station. So, you need to get people's attention within the first verse/chorus of a song,” Wollam Nichols explains. The songwriters are evaluated: one to five on song, one to five on performance, and a notes section for additional thoughts. It takes about a month for the evaluations to be compiled and completed, and six to eight writers usually pass. Those writers become eligible to play on Sunday nights for the six-writer set and once they perform well at four of those nights (this usually takes two years), they can be booked for the 6pm In The Round sessions. Artists including Kenny Chesney, Carolyn Dawn Johnson and Dierks Bentley successfully passed their auditions. If an artist is invited to perform at the late show four times by the songwriters who have passed, that counts as four auditions. Taylor Swift made it onto the In The Round stage by invitation in 2004 and, as a young songwriter, “held her own” on a stage with three grown men, Wollam Nichols says. The Bluebird has a reputation for welcoming talent early in their careers. Faith Hill, Trisha Yearwood, Guy Clark, Townes Van Zandt, Janis Ian, The Indigo Girls and many more have showcased their talent at The Bluebird. When Garth Brooks played The Bluebird in 1987, he had been passed on by every Nashville label. “A record executive, Lynn Schults (from Capitol Records), who had passed on him heard him play a set at the Bluebird – saw the impact he had on the room and took him into the kitchen and said, ‘I think we missed something,'” Wollam Nichols tells Billboard. “Garth is top notch,” Wollam Nichols says. “He really is the best friend you can have in an industry. They wouldn't leave,” says Wollam Nichols, who took over as GM when NSAI became stewards of the venue. “Then they would yell at us because ‘we weren't managing things properly.' I don't know what you want me to do because you won't leave and we can't let you in because we are full. Ticket sales go straight to the performers' pockets, so the venue makes money from food and beverage, limited sponsorships and merchandise. The Bluebird was created for songwriters to have their voices heard and now those songs are being heard by people from all walks of life. “The intimacy that [The Bluebird] experience creates opens people up and they become maybe a little more friendly, a little more thoughtful,” Wollam Nichols says.

The annoyed “Cookin' With Brooklyn” star then blocked his mom, as well as his dad, David Beckham, and brother Cruz within hours. The outlet also reported that Brooklyn had blocked his other siblings, Romeo and Harper Beckham. A source told the US Sun that David, 50, and Victoria are “understandably heartbroken by what's gone on here.” By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. “All they want is for things to be fixed but with every week they just seem to be getting worse. Unsurprisingly, Cruz and Romeo are furious that Brooklyn would make such a public attack.” The source claimed Brooklyn wants his family issues “fixed in private and not played out on social media, although his actions have resulted in quite the opposite.” Over the weekend, Cruz, 20, took to Instagram to shut down reports that his parents had unfollowed their eldest child on Instagram. My mum and dad would never unfollow their son,” the “Optics” singer wrote alongside a screenshot of an article. They woke up blocked … as did I,” Cruz added. He “really focused on living a peaceful, drama-free life” with his wife, Nicola Peltz, 30.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Footage captured by filmmaker Jennifer Silliman, who's heading up production on a documentary about Hynes' fandom, has understandably sent them over the moon. Silliman told EntertainmentNow she was in the right place at the right time on December 18, 2025, to capture Hynes participating in a hilarious booty-shaking challenge at the Hallmark Christmas Experience in Kansas City. As soon as she shared the video online, fans swarmed the post with cheeky comments, swooning over what they'd just seen. Silliman was in Kansas City to shoot footage with fans for the Hynies documentary, due for release in 2027, and was front and center when Hynes participated in a Reindeer Games challenge that required him to use his, um, assets. The “Christmas Above the Clouds” star and other Hallmark hunks had boxes tied around their waists, filled with plastic balls and a cut-out hole on top. Silliman had the ideal vantage point, filming as Hynes shook, danced, gyrated, twerked, and basically set the Westin Hotel ballroom on fire as his teammate, fellow Hallmark star Rachel Boston, cheered him on. Silliman told EntertainmentNow, “As the director of the Hynies documentary, I've learned to always keep the camera rolling — because Tyler Hynes has a habit of delivering iconic moments when you least expect them. Her video has quickly racked up thousands of likes and hilarious comments from fans on Instagram and Facebook, including one that said, “CHRISTMAS CAME EARLY OMG 😂🥵” Though we hear Hynes technically didn't win the competition, his fans are sure to agree with the Hynie who commented, “OMG, that's a freaking winning performance if I ever saw one, 😂😂😂😂👏👏👏❤️🔥🔥🔥” Was in the audience during that show with my wife ….to say the least it was a new side she saw of Tyler.

Since our last check-in, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences found a new broadcasting partner for the Academy Awards telecast (adios ABC and hello YouTube, starting in 2029); Netflix bought Warner Bros. for $82.7 billion (although Paramount is still trying to derail that deal and make one of its own); and there have been a ton of developments that could be harbingers of things to come exactly one month from today, on Jan. 22, 2026, when the Academy will announce the nominees for the 98th Oscars. Meanwhile, contenders have been hitting the campaign trail hard — among other places, at the aforementioned Gotham Awards ceremony in New York; at the Golden Globes First-Time Nominees Luncheon in Los Angeles; at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival's Kirk Douglas Award for Excellence in Film gala; and on THR's celebrated annual Roundtables, several of which have already gone live on our website (Actress, Documentary, Animation, Songwriter and Cinematographer), and the rest of which will roll out over the next several weeks. And, over the weekend, we finally learned some critical and commercial numbers for one of the last major Oscar hopefuls on the 2025 calendar, 20th Century's Avatar: Fire and Ash. The third installment in James Cameron's Pandora-set franchise has come in at 67 percent with critics and 91 percent with audiences on Rotten Tomatoes, and with a worldwide opening weekend gross of $345 million. For reference, 2009's Avatar came in at 81 percent/82 percent and $241.6 million, and wound up a major Oscar player, while 2022's Avatar: The Way of Water came in at 76 percent/92 percent and $441.7 million, and did not. In short, it's too early to project a trajectory for Avatar: Fire and Ash, but stay tuned. The bottom line: Given that the clock is about to run out on 2025, I thought that I would make my final Feinberg Forecast of the year as in-depth and explanatory as any so far. And happy holidays to you all! PLEASE REMEMBER: Scott's forecasts do not necessarily reflect his personal preferences. His aim is not to advocate for what he thinks the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences should do, but rather to project what they will do. He arrives at his projections by screening many films, analyzing their campaigns, speaking with voters and studying relevant history and stats. FYI A number of films have had strong showings since our last update: Netflix's Train Dreams made the AFI top 10 and landed best picture Critics Choice and Spirit noms (it looks likely to win the latter); Neon's Sirāt showed up on five Oscar shortlists (a tally bested by only Warners' Sinners, Universal's Wicked: For Good and Netflix's Frankenstein); Focus' Bugonia and Sony Classics' Blue Moon landed best pic (musical/comedy) Golden Globe noms, with the former also making the AFI top 10; and Janus' Peter Hujar's Day cracked the top five for both the best feature Spirit Award and the USC Scripter Award. But let's be honest, almost all indications are that Warners' One Battle After Another is way out in front of the rest of the field. Since our last update, it was awarded the top prizes of the premier LA and New York film critics groups, as well as the NBR and the Gothams, and it also landed the most Golden Globe noms and the second-most Critics Choice noms of all films. There are sizable bases of support for several other contenders — Hamnet, Sinners, Marty Supreme, Sentimental Value and Frankenstein all seem like slam-dunk best picture nominees, too — and there are still 80-plus days until the Oscars. But this is starting to feel like an Oppenheimer-esque runaway train. It Was Just an Accident (Neon)12. FYI Paul Thomas Anderson, the presumptive Oscar frontrunner for One Battle After Another, held serve by landing Globe and Critics Choice noms and winning LAFCA and NBR prizes. But It Was Just an Accident's Jafar Panahi has made significant inroads in the wake of the Dec. 1 announcement that Iran sentenced him to prison in-absentia for making his film, which does not reflect well on the country — he has since garnered a Globe nom and NYFCC and Gotham wins for best director; plus his film made the best international feature Oscar shortlist, having been submitted by France, from which it derived financing, because Iran wanted nothing to do with it. Meanwhile, Critics Choice and Golden Globe voters allocated five of their respective six best director slots to the same filmmakers: PTA, Sinners' Ryan Coogler, Frankenstein's Guillermo del Toro, Sentimental Value's Joachim Trier and Hamnet's Chloe Zhao. Stipulating that both groups are comprised of journalists, and that journalists are not represented in the Academy, that's still pretty noteworthy. (The sixth Globe nom went to Panahi, as mentioned above, while the sixth Critics Choice nom went to Marty Supreme's Josh Safdie.) The wild card is James Cameron, whose Avatar: Fire and Ash is entering the race very late in the game. Cameron won this category's Oscar for Titanic 28 years ago and he must have come damn close to winning it again for the first Avatar 16 years ago, but he was not even nominated for it for Avatar: The Way of Water three years ago. I doubt that any filmmaker had more of a directorial challenge this year than he did, but are members of the Academy's directors branch beginning to take his work for granted and/or lose interest in the world of Avatar?

FYI Best actor honors went from the NBR to One Battle After Another's Leonardo DiCaprio, from the New York film critics to The Secret Agent's Wagner Moura, and from the L.A film critics to Blue Moon's Ethan Hawke. DiCaprio, Moura and Hawke also were nominated for both Globe and Critics Choice awards, as were Marty Supreme's Timothee Chalamet, Train Dreams' Joel Edgerton and Sinners' Michael B. Jordan. Those are certainly notable showings — but I would just caution that only journalists determined those outcomes, and no journalists are represented in the Academy' acting branch, which solely determines the best actor Oscar noms. I think that's of particular concern regarding Hawke. Most journalists who vote for the aforementioned awards watch everything that's considered a contender, whereas most actors who vote for the Oscars do not, and I think that the relatively low profile of Blue Moon means that Oscar voters may prioritize other titles. For what it's worth, I'd like to urge them not to: Hawke is one of our greatest actors and his portrayal of Lorenz Hart is one of his greatest performances, albeit in a movie that is a bit like a filmed play. Receiving “just” Globe noms were Jay Kelly's George Clooney, Frankenstein's Oscar Isaac, The Smashing Machine's Dwayne Johnson, No Other Choice's Lee Byung-hun, Bugonia's Jesse Plemons and Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere's Jeremy Allen White. Edgerton also nabbed a Spirit Award nom. Wagner Moura for The Secret Agent (Neon)2. Leonardo DiCaprio for One Battle After Another (Warner Bros.)4. Michael B.

Bill Skarsgård for Dead Man's Wire (Row K) FYI Six actresses landed both Critics Choice and Golden Globe noms: Hamnet's Jessie Buckley, If I Had Legs I'd Kick You's Rose Byrne, One Battle After Another's Chase Infiniti, Sentimental Value's Renate Reinsve, The Testament of Ann Lee's Amanda Seyfried and Bugonia's Emma Stone. (The other best actress Globe nominees, across the drama and musical/comedy categories, are Wicked: For Good's Cynthia Erivo, Song Sung Blue's Kate Hudson, Die My Love's Jennifer Lawrence, After the Hunt's Julia Roberts, Hedda's Tessa Thompson and Sorry, Baby's Eva Victor.) Byrne, in particular, is on a roll of landing major recognition for her performance as a working mother of a sick child. In addition to the aforemenetioned Critics Choice and Golden Globe noms, the popular Aussie alum of Damages and Bridesmaids also was nominated for a Gotham Award and is nominated for a Spirit Award, and she was chosen as the year's best actress by the NBR and both L.A. and New York's top critics groups. With those sorts of accolades, she surely a slam-dunk for an Oscar nom, no? Two other actresses who, relatively recently, gave widely acclaimed performances in similarly dark comedies — Marianne Jean-Baptiste in Hard Truths last year and Sally Hawkins in Happy-Go-Lucky in 2008 — landed very similar accolades, but then were passed over by the Academy. I believe this happened — and could happen again — because journalists watch far more contenders than many Oscar voters do, and many Oscar voters turn off movies they find oppressively dark and/or with a main character they find unlikable. This could be an impediment for not just Byrne, but also Lawrence and Seyfried. One other note: Infiniti was tapped for the NBR's breakthrough performance prize, for which lead and supporting actors and actresses are considered. Renate Reinsve for Sentimental Value (Neon)3.

FYI The Critics Choice and Golden Globe awards' supporting actor categories were filled out with the exact same six people: One Battle After Another's Benicio del Toro and Sean Penn, Frankenstein's Jacob Elordi, Hamnet's Paul Mescal, Jay Kelly's Adam Sandler and Sentimental Value's Stellan Skarsgård. The five eventual Oscar nominees will almost certainly come from that pool of six people. A few other things to consider: Del Toro, Elordi, Sandler and Skarsgård also were nominated for the Gotham Award. The New York critics and the NBR went for del Toro, who now seems to have lapped his own co-star, Penn, in terms of overall momentum. Elordi is probably the least well known of the lot, and his actual face is never on screen. Sandler's movie is on the least solid ground of anyone in this group, and he may lose some votes to his scene-stealing co-star, Billy Crudup.

Andrew Scott for Blue Moon (Sony Classics)16. Ben Foster for Christy (Black Bear)17. FYI The supporting actress field appears to have narrowed considerably, of late. Critics Choice and Golden Globe voters arrived at five of the same nominees: Wicked: For Good's Ariana Grande, Weapons' Amy Madigan, One Battle After Another's Teyana Taylor and Sentimental Value's Elle Fanning and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas. The sixth Critics Choice nominee was Sinners' Wunmi Mosaku and the sixth Golden Globe nominee was The Smashing Machine's Emily Blunt. LAFCA and NBR went for Lilleaas, NYFCC went for Madigan and the Gotham Award went to Mosaku (over Lilleaas and Taylor, among others). Still, one cannot totally count out the likes of Regina Hall, who has the least showy part of the three principal actresses in One Battle After Another, but is a well-liked veteran and might be able to ride her film's coattails to a nom; several Spirit Award nominees, Nouvelle Vague's Zoey Deutch, Roofman's Kirsten Dunst and Hedda's Nina Hoss; the Marty Supreme gals, Gwyneth Paltrow and Odessa A'zion, and the Train Dreams gals, Kerry Condon and Felicity Jones; and perhaps Avatar: Fire and Ash's Oona Chaplin, who, for my money, was the very best part of her late-breaking film.

Hailee Steinfeld for Sinners (Warner Bros.) — podcast Jennifer Lopez for Kiss of the Spider Woman (Roadside) — podcast16. Kerry Condon for Train Dreams (Netflix)20. Felicity Jones for Train Dreams (Netflix) FYI Only two films received best adapted screenplay noms from Critics Choice, Golden Globe and USC Scripter voters: Hamnet and One Battle After Another. Frankenstein and Train Dreams were nominated by both Critics Choice and USC Scripter voters. Assuming those four films are in for Oscar noms, as I suspect they are (Train Dreams also won the NBR's prize), which adaptation is likeliest to land the final slot in the category? The fifth USC Scripter nom went to Peter Hujar's Day (over the likes of Die My Love, Hedda, Mickey 17, Nuremberg, Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere, Wicked: For Good and two very different Stephen King adaptations, The Life of Chuck and The Long Walk), which also led the Spirit Awards in overall noms (although, bizarrely, its screenplay wasn't one of them). And the fifth and sixth Critics Choice noms went to two films that weren't eligible for the Scripter: Bugonia, which was ineligible because it was adapted from an earlier film, and No Other Choice, which was ineligible because it's a non-English-language film. Those three films have to be taken very seriously. I'd also keep an eye on Pillion, which won the Gotham Award over No Other Choice, One Battle After Another and Train Dreams, among others; and Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery, considering that both of the prior two installments of Rian Johnson's Benoit Blanc franchise received screenplay noms.

FYI There are some original scripts that everyone seems to be getting behind: Marty Supreme, Sinners and Sentimental Value received Critics Choice and Golden Globe noms. Marty Supreme also won the New York film critics' prize, Sinners also won the NBR award, and It Was Just an Accident claimed both the Gotham Award and L.A. critics' laurels. It's going to be hard to displace any of those four titles from the Oscar lineup. But what of the fifth slot? The safest bet remains Jay Kelly, a Critics Choice nominee, not least because co-writer Noah Baumbach has a long and solid track record with the Academy's writers branch — he's previously been nominated for 2005's The Squid and the Whale, 2019's Marriage Story and 2023's Barbie. But don't count out Eva Victor's Sorry, Baby, which is coming on strong late in the game, having landed Critics Choice, Gotham and Spirit noms, and placed second in the L.A. critics' voting. (Victor is also nominated for a Golden Globe for playing the lead in the film and was tapped by the NBR for their best directorial debut award and by the L.A. critics for their New Generation award.) Other possibilities include, but are not limited to, Critics Choice nominee Weapons; Gotham nominees If I Had Legs I'd Kick You, The Secret Agent and Sound of Falling; and the utterly charming, Oscar-shortlisted Taiwanese film Left-Handed Girl, which was co-written by the most recent winner of this award, Sean Baker. In a fair world, Dead Man's Wire would also have a shot, but it has slipped under the radar for many voters. Sentimental Value (Neon) — Joachim Trier & Eskil Vogt4.

FYI Members from all branches of the Academy were invited to help select 15 titles for the Oscar shortlist from 86 submissions (provided they met a minimum viewing requirement), and members from all branches are now invited to help pick five nominees from that shortlist (provided they attest that they have watched all 15 shortlisted titles). The shortlist includes a film from Iran that was submitted by France (this year's winner of the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or, It Was Just an Accident); Japan's highest-grossing live-action film of all time, which Tom Cruise recently championed at an L.A. screening (Kokuho); three films about troubles in the Middle East (Tunisia's The Voice of Hind Rijab, Palestine's Palestine 36, Jordan's All That's Left of You); and, for the first time ever, a film from Iraq (The President's Cake). The most glaring omissions from the shortlist were, to me, Belgium's Young Mothers (Music Box), Poland's Franz (Cohen Media Group) and three docs: Ukraine's 2000 Meters to Andriivka (PBS), North Macdeonia's The Tale of Silyan (Nat Geo) and Denmark's Mr. Nobody Against Putin (still seeking U.S. distribution). 2000 Meters to Andriivka and Mr. Nobody Against Putin did, however, make it onto the best documentary feature Oscar shortlist. It's worth noting that Spain's Sirāt appeared on five Oscar shortlists, more than any other non-English-language film; Brazil's The Secret Agent was awarded both the New York and L.A. film critics groups' prizes for best film not in the English language; It Was Just an Accident won the NBR Award and — over a field that included two other films that were eventually Oscar-shortlisted, South Korea's No Other Choice and Germany's Sound of Falling — the Gotham Award; Left-Handed Girl, The Secret Agent, Norway's Sentimental Value and Sirāt were included on the NBR's (alphabetical) list of the top five international films; Argentina's Belén, It Was Just an Accident, Left-Handed Girl, No Other Choice, The Secret Agent and Sirāt received best foreign-language film Critics Choice noms; and All That's Left of You, The Secret Agent and Sirāt received best international film Spirit Award noms. Something to keep an eye on is how many of the final five slots end up going to Neon-distributed films. There is a very real chance that it could be all of them, given that they include the heavy-hitters It Was Just an Accident, No Other Choice, The Secret Agent, Sirāt and Sentimental Value. France — It Was Just an Accident (Neon)3. Tunisia — The Voice of Hind Rajab (Willa) South Korea — No Other Choice (Neon)8. Iraq — The President's Cake (Sony Classics)10. Germany — Sound of Falling (Mubi)12. Jordan — All That's Left of You (Watermelon/Visibility)14. FYI Members of the Academy's documentary branch solely selected a shortlist of 15 doc features from a pool of 201 eligible titles, and will solely select five nominees from that shortlist. The shortlist's most glaring omissions, in my estimation, were HBO's My Mom Jayne, Mariska Hargitay's beautiful film about her relationship with her mom, the late movie star Jayne Mansfield, which had been embraced by numerous other groups, including the Producers Guild; Neon's Orwell: 2+2=5, which was directed by past Oscar nominee Raoul Peck and skillfully connects the past to the present; and Nat Geo's The Tale of Silyan, which just days ago won the top prize of the International Documentary Assocation's IDA Awards. Netflix's The Perfect Neighbor — a study of one particularly horrific invocation of Florida's “Stand Your Ground” law, which was, for a time, the most-watched film of any sort on the streaming platform — remains the film to beat in this category. But keep a close eye on a five-and-a-half-hour film that has no U.S. distributor at all, My Undesirable Friends: Part I — Last Air in Moscow, a portrait of fearless independent journalists in Russia during the run-up to the war in Ukraine, which has tremendous late momentum in its favor. It has been vocally championed by virtually everyone who has seen it, from highly respected documentarians with films of their own on the shortlist (Oscar winner Laura Poitras of Netflix's Cover-Up) to critics groups (both New York and L.A.'s top groups of film critics chose it as the year's top doc, as did the Gotham Awards) to arts organizations (it's up for the best doc Spirit Award). And yes, for those of you wondering, Part II is currently in the works. My Undesirable Friends: Part I – Last Air in Moscow (still seeking U.S. distribution)3. Come See Me in the Good Light (Apple)8. Mr. Nobody Against Putin (still seeking U.S. distribution)10. Cutting Through Rocks (still seeking U.S. distribution)14. FYI The Academy's animation branch marches to its own beat, so no precursor is a particularly reliable predictor. But it should nevertheless be noted that both Critics Choice and Golden Globe noms went to Neon's Arco, Disney/Pixar's Elio, Netflix's KPop Demon Hunters, GKIDS's Little Amélie or the Character of Rain and Disney's Zootopia 2. (The other Critics Choice nominee was Netflix's In Your Dreams and the other Golden Globe nominee was Sony's Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle). Moreover, the three highest-profile prizes that have already been awarded for animation each went to a different film: The New York critics went with KPop Demon Hunters, the L.A. critics went with Little Amélie or the Character of Rain, and the NBR went with Arco. Zootopia 2, meanwhile, is laughing all the way to the bank — it has grossed $1.27 billion worldwide, the second-most of any 2025 film, and a half-billion more than the year's next highest-grossing animated film, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle.

The Critics Choice Awards, which is also introducing a casting/ensemble category for the first time, nominated Hamnet, Marty Supreme, One Battle After Another, Sinners and Wicked: For Good, as well as a sixth film that did not make the Oscar shortlist, Jay Kelly. One Battle After Another (Warner Bros.) — Cassandra Kulukundis4. Sirāt (Neon) — Nadia Acimi, Luís Bértolo & María Rodrigo5. The Secret Agent (Neon) — Gabriel Domingues Wicked: For Good (Universal) — Tiffany Little Canfield & Bernard Telsey8. Sentimental Value (Neon) — Yngvill Kolset Haga & Avy Kaufman10. FYI Members of the Academy's cinematography branch chose 16 films for this category's shortlist and will solely determine the five nominees. Precusor recognition has been largely split between Sinners and Train Dreams. Both films also received Critics Choice noms, as did F1, Frankenstein, Hamnet and One Battle After Another. One Battle After Another (Warner Bros.) — Michael Bauman5. Ballad of a Small Player (Netflix) — James Friend Song Sung Blue (Focus) — Amy Vincent FYI This is one of the hardest Oscar categories to predict. And there are only a few precursors, none of which are particularly helpful. Voters for the Costume Designers Guild Awards nominate work in three different areas, whereas there is no such distinction at the Oscars. (This year's CDG nominees for work in contemporary film are Bugonia, F1, One Battle After Another; Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery and Weapons; for work in period film are Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale, Frankenstein, Hamnet, Hedda and Sinners; and for work in sci-fi/fantasy are Avatar: Fire and Ash, How to Train Your Dragon, Thunderbolts*, Tron: Ares and Wicked: For Good.) Critics Choice voters nominate six films, but frankly, don't really know much about costume design. (Our picks this year were Frankenstein, Hamnet, Hedda, Kiss of the Spider Woman, Sinners and Wicked: For Good). The winner of that was Hedda. The one thing you can usually count on the Academy's costume designers branch to do is to not nominate work on films that are set primarily in the present. Costumes tailored for the past, the future or an imagined world are far likelier to make their cut. Kiss of the Spider Woman (Roadside) — Colleen Atwood & Christine Cantella7.

FYI Members of the Academy's makeup artists and hairstylists branch solely selected 10 films for the shortlist and will solely pick five nominees from the shortlist after being offered the opportunity to view excerpts from the shortlisted films and interviews with the artists behind them on Jan. 10, 2026. Critics Choice nominations went to Frankenstein, Sinners, The Smashing Machine and Wicked: For Good (as well as two films that did not make the Oscar shortlist, 28 Years Later and Weapons). Frankenstein won the American Cinematheque's Tribute to the Crafts' hair and makeup award. The Ugly Stepsister (still seeking U.S. distribution) FYI Members of the Academy's music branch chose 20 scores for this category's shortlist from 132 options and will solely determine the five nominees. The Society of Composers and Lyricists, which includes many music branch members, nominated six scores from studio films and six scores from indie films for awards. All of its nominees for the former are also on the Oscar shortlist (Bugonia, Frankenstein, Hamnet, One Battle After Another, Sinners and Wicked: For Good), but the same is true of just one of its nominees for the latter (Train Dreams). The Oscar shortlist also includes all five scores that received both Critics Choice and Golden Globe noms — F1, Frankenstein, Hamnet, One Battle After Another, Sinners — as well as the other Critics Choice nominee, Marty Supreme, and the other Golden Globe nominee, Sirāt. Finally, a word about the score of Sirāt, which is unlike any that has ever been nominated for an Oscar. Its French-born/Germany-residing composer, Kangding Ray, is a specialist in electronic, techno, underground, rave-type music, original pieces of which are performed both within and over the action of the film. It has been cool to see Ray's work recognized not only by Globes voters, but also with prizes from the Cannes Film Festival and the L.A. film critics; and to see Sirāt shortlisted not just for the score Oscar, but also for the sound Oscar, given how closely Ray worked on integrating the score with the fim's overall soundscape. As Filmmaker magazine wrote of Sirāt, “Few recent films have offered such an overwhelmingly immersive audiovisual experience.” FrontrunnersSinners (Warner Bros.) — Ludwig GöranssonOne Battle After Another (Warner Bros.) — Johnny GreenwoodFrankenstein (Netflix) — Alexandre DesplatSirāt (Neon) — Kangding RayJay Kelly (Netflix) — Nicholas Britell (podcast) Major ThreatsF1 (Apple/Warner Bros.) — Hans Zimmer (podcast)Hamnet (Focus) — Max RichterAvatar: Fire and Ash (20th Century) — Simon FranglenHedda (Amazon/MGM) — Hildur GuðnadóttirMarty Supreme (A24) — Daniel LopatinA House of Dynamite (Netflix) — Volker BertelmannTrain Dreams (Netflix) — Bryce DessnerTron: Ares (Disney) — Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross PossibilitiesWake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery (Netflix) — Nathan JohnsonWicked: For Good (Universal) — John Powell and Stephen SchwartzNuremberg (Sony Classics) — Brian TylerBugonia (Focus) — Jerskin FendrixCaptain America: Brave New World (Disney) — Laura KarpmanDiane Warren: Relentless (MasterClass) — Lesley BarberTruth and Treason (Angel) — Aaron Zigman FYI Members of the Academy's music branch chose 15 songs for this category's shortlist from 65 options and will solely determine five nominees. That's great news for songwriters who branch members have long known and loved, as demonstrated by past recognition — among them Mark Ronson, Andrew Wyatt, Ludwig Göransson, Stephen Schwartz, Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross and especially Diane Warren, who the branch is poised to recognize with her ninth consecutive — and 17th overall — nomination in this category. Warren was shortlisted this year for a song (“Dear Me”) from a little-seen documentary (MasterClass' Diane Warren: Relentless), the score of which the branch also shortlisted. Hers is but one of four shortlisted songs from docs: The others come from Come See Me in the Good Light (“Salt Then Sour Then Sweet”), Billy Idol Should Be Dead (“Dying to Live”) and Viva Verdi! It will be interesting to see how the branch handles the two films that landed multiple songs on the shortlist this year: Sinners, with “I Lied to You” and “Last Time (I Seen the Sun),” and Wicked: For Good, with “The Girl in the Bubble” and “No Place Like Home.” At each of the last two Oscars, a single film — Barbie and Emilia Pérez — wound up with two songs among the final five, including the eventual winner. But vote-splitting is also a possibility, which begs the question: Is F1, which had three songs in the running for the shortlist, but got only one on the shortlist, “Drive,” actually in a better position to advance a song to the next round? I'll note that a bunch of the shortlisted tunes have been landing recognition elsewhere in recent days. The Society of Composers and Lyricists, which includes many music branch members, nominated six songs from dramatic or documentary films and six songs from comedy or musical films. Five of its six nominees for the former are also on the Oscar shortlist (“Dear Me,” “Drive,” “Last Time (I Seen the Sun),” “I Lied to You,” and “Salt Then Sour Then Sweet”), as are three of its nominees for the latter (“The Girl in the Bubble,” “No Place Like Home” and Oscar frontrunner/American Cinematheque's Tribute to the Crafts song award honoree “Golden” from KPop Demon Hunters). Meanwhile, Critics Choice and Golden Globe noms went to “Golden,” “The Girl in the Bubble” and “I Lied to You,” plus “Train Dreams” (Train Dreams). The other Globe noms went to “No Place Like Home” and “Dream as One” (Avatar: Fire and Ash), while the other Critics Choice noms went to “Drive” and a song that did not make the Oscar shortlist (“Clothed by the Sun” from The Testament of Ann Lee). Lastly, I'll just point out that there are a lot of big names who performed this year's shortlisted songs in the films for which they are nominated — among them Sara Bareilles, Brandi Carlile, Billy Idol, Ariana Grande, Cynthia Erivo, Miley Cyrus, Ed Sheeran, Nine Inch Nails, Nick Cave and Ke$ha — as is the case almost every year, which is why I keep urging the Academy to rent out the Hollywood Bowl or the Greek for a night of performances of the shortlisted songs for members of the music branch, plus others. It would be one of the hottest tickets and coolest concerts of the year. Maybe in a couple of years, once the YouTube money kicks in, they will actually do this! “Golden” from KKPop Demon Hunters (Netflix) — EJAE and Mark Sonnenblick — listen2. “I Lied to You” from Sinners (Warner Bros.) — Raphael Saadiq & Ludwig Göransson — listen3. “Dream As One” from Avatar: Fire and Ash (20th Century) — Miley Cyrus (podcast), Simon Franglen, Mark Ronson (podcast) & Andrew Wyatt — listen5. “Salt Then Sour Then Sweet” from Come See Me In the Good Light (Apple) — Sara Bareilles, Brandi Carlile & Andrea Gibson — listen9. “Last Time (I Seen the Sun)” from Sinners (Warner Bros.) — Miles Caton, Ludwig Göransson & Alice Smith — listen10. “Drive” from F1 (Apple/Warner Bros.) — John Mayer, Ed Sheeran (podcast) & Blake Slatkin — listen “No Place Like Home” from Wicked: For Good (Universal) — Stephen Schwartz — listen12. “As Alive as You Need Me to Be” from Tron: Ares (Disney) — Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross — listen13. “Dying to Live” from Billy Idol Should Be Dead (Fremantle) — Tommy English, Billy Idol, Joe Janiak, J.

Plastered on billboards, across buses and filling our TikTok feeds are ads for the city's hottest new theater ticket: A seat in The Hunger Games arena, in a world-first adaptation of Suzanne Collins‘ smash-hit dystopian franchise that sees 24 children offered up to a totalitarian dictatorship and made to kill one another for sport. Adapted by Conor McPherson and directed by Matthew Dunster, the enthralling, 2.5-hour production is a feat of engineering, technology, choreography, illusion work and just about every possible creative department you could think of. Created just for The Hunger Games: On Stage, the venue features a handful of sub-stages, swivelling audience seating and complicated rigs that are used to suspend its performers and props 30-odd feet in the air. 'Emily in Paris' Creator Unpacks Love Triangle Chaos and Teases Potential Season 6 After Finale Jimmy Kimmel to Deliver Channel 4's Alternative Christmas Message 2025 The play also has something The Hunger Games franchise isn't in any need of: star power. The young, Liverpudlian actress lands her first major role in Dunster's production after some years spent training at the prestigious Tring Park School for the Performing Arts in Hertfordshire, England. The daughter of Liverpool Football Club legend Jamie Carragher, the 21-year-old is making a name for herself on her own terms — and not letting that Scouse accent slip one bit. “Honestly, it came quite naturally, which I was quite glad about,” the performer tells The Hollywood Reporter about nailing Katniss' American accent. “The other day, our associate director said, ‘We've done 50 shows' And I was like, ‘What the hell?' It literally just comes out of your body.” It's all muscle memory for Carragher now: The sprinting, the climbing, the archery, all in between monologuing as a petrified, underestimated Katniss and sharing intimate moments with her Peeta Mellark (Euan Garrett). She admits to being “obsessed” with Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson's Hunger Games performances — and, in what might have been something of a good omen, even worked with the latter on a film last year — but her rebellion-sparking sharpshooter isn't an imitation of Lawrence's Katniss. “I wanted to make it my own and see what I could do with the character, but also, with the material that I had and how we were performing it — on stage and in the purpose-built theater — there was no other option than to have a different version of [her],” Carragher explains to THR. She reveals some of the A-list stars to have come and watched, which sequence is the trickiest to get right each night and why fans are flocking to see how this world-renowned tale can be told in front of a live audience: “There's people that have traveled from America just to come and watch — it makes you think, ‘This means so much to so many people. Were you a fan before this role came along? Yeah, I was a fan of the films and I'm obsessed with Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson's [movies]. I would re-watch them all the time. I remember they were on Netflix for a while. I think they've been taken off Netflix now. So then when the audition came about, I was like, “What?” At first I was so curious [about] how they were going to do it on stage. And then when the audition came through, that's when I was like, “Oh my god, I need to read these books as many times as possible to prep.” So I was on holiday in Thailand, and I think the audition came through and it was for the day after I got back from Thailand. The whole last week when I was on holiday, I was trying to prep as much as I could, but it was just a movement call, so I didn't get any sides [a few excerpts from a script] or anything. I just knew that if I was going to read, it was going to be for Katniss. And I think— I mean, it did go well, because then when I was on my way home, my agent rang me and said, “Can you read tomorrow for Katniss?” I was like, “Oh my god!” And then my mum and dad were in London for Valentine's Day, and I crashed and stayed in their hotel. Then I read, and it went well. A couple weeks later, I read again, then we did a fight call, and that was with Kev [McCurdy], our fight director. And again, I went into that trying to embody Katniss in the fights. Two weeks later, I got the call. When you were in the early rehearsal stages for this show, was the physicality daunting or just exciting? Because obviously you're just reading stage directions and script and then going in the rehearsal room and seeing how physical it was gonna be… But I was kind of excited, because all my training could be used for this role. You just get a little feeling… I couldn't explain it. I've maybe had it with other things before, but never this much. And then a couple days before, Matthew, the director, followed me on Instagram. And then I was checking to see who he follows, and he'd followed a couple of other people, and I was like, “Maybe they've got it.” It was two days later, I took myself on a walk because I couldn't think straight. I didn't know what to do. But this is my debut in professional theater. So what kind of prep went into your Katniss? Did you want to make it different? In my head, I wanted to make it my own and see what I could do with the character, but also, with the material that I had and how we were performing it — on stage and in the purpose-built theater — there was no other option than to have a different version of [her]. But then in the rehearsal process, I think I really just found my way with the script, written by Conor McPherson and then Matthew Dunster, the director. Being in the space, especially, I think helped all of us a lot. We did six weeks in a studio, and then we had quite a long tech [rehearsal]. It was three or four weeks of tech rehearsal. On the first preview, we did a dress rehearsal. And that was the first time we'd ever done the play as everything all together, because it was so tech heavy, it took us so long to put it all together. There is so many things to think about at once and whoever is in charge of that operation has nerves of steel. Before we discuss, a quick note on your very convincing American accent. I actually went to New York to study acting at [the] Lee Strasberg [Theatre & Film Institute]. So I was around a lot of American people there. While I was there, I did accent lessons to help with the American accent, because we do a lot of scene work, and because people were American, I'd try and match it. For this, we did have an accent coach, but to be honest, it was on very little things where it was little words that I needed to make sure that I was saying the proper American way, so no one was like, “She's not American.” But honestly, it came quite naturally, which I was quite glad about. It's so funny, I think the other day, our associate director said, “We've done 50 shows.” And I was like, “What the hell?” You don't even think. It literally just comes out of your body. There's the tech, art, props, choreography, so much to think about. How many months were you in rehearsal and who were the formative voices through the decision-making of shaping such a physical show? And we're creating a whole new play. So I was really thankful [that] Matthew, the director, he had a really strong idea of how he wanted everything to go. And I'd done a couple workshops before rehearsal. They had a strong plan about what they were going to do when we went into it, which I think was super helpful. We also had a movement director, Charlotte Broom, our fight director Kev and we had an illusions [creative, Chris Fisher] — every possible department. Then we'd all come together in rehearsal. But obviously, Matthew always made the final decision. It was crazy to see in previews how much [the show] changed. I think the first preview was nearly three and a half hours long. We cut, like, 45 minutes off the play. So in previews, when we're performing of a night, we'd be there all day chopping and changing things around. So the beginning is I come up from sub-stage by myself. But at first it started with all of the tributes coming up, and we did a distorted version of the beginning of act two, where we're in the games and it was shown as a nightmare scene. Then one day we just came in and they were like, “Yeah, that's not the beginning anymore.” And we were all just, “Oh, okay!” I was thinking about you guys just running around for three hours. The first time we did it, I was dead. My body knows everything that's happening now, so I've definitely gotten used to it. But sometimes, even when we have just the one day off a week, and then we go back to do it on the Tuesday, I'm like, “God, that was hard just having one day off.” Which sequence do you find the most stressful? So as well as doing your own fight, you have to be so aware of what's going on around you. There's a few times where a few of us have actually slipped, because we haven't looked down to see where the blood's been splattered. And then, when the tracker jacker nest comes down. It's so clever, but I am sending thoughts and prayers to whoever is in charge of health and safety! The bit that really stands out to me is the bit when Thresh lets me go. Obviously, there's emotional bits [of the show] and sometimes it can be hard to reach that state every night. It's near the end of the play as well and I think my body knows I'm nearly there. And I think the ones that really mean the most to me is a lot of young girls, when they come to watch and they say, “Oh, that's what I want to do when I'm older,” or, “You've really inspired me,” or “Katniss has showed me that I can do this.” They're the messages where I'm like, “Oh, my god, that is so lovely.” And every time I see younger people in the audience, if I'm finding it hard that day, it keeps me going. The Hunger Games IP is so popular, so it's no wonder people have been flocking to it. I knew it was going to be so cool and loads of people there, but there's people that have traveled from America just to come and watch this specifically. I'm like, “What?” Or people just traveling from other countries, or even coming down from Scotland just for the day to come and watch. I think it also really helps to have John Malkovich there — that big name attached. In our scenes we talk, but obviously he's on the screen. So when he went to record it, we stood behind the camera and read the lines and that was just so cool. We were all like [widens eyes], but he was so nice to everyone. We were all a bit nervous, but he made everyone feel comfortable. God, we like to say this all the time. This is so not possible, but I think Caesar [Flickerman] just seems like such a fun role. I think Clove, one of the tributes, is a really cool role as well. I think Cato and Clove have a lovely relationship, and I think it's really shown in our play as well. She has her knives, which is very cool. Did you take archery lessons for this? I did a few weeks of a course before I moved to London, and then, it's so funny — the other day, the people who taught me archery traveled from Liverpool to come watch. I was so scared they were gonna be like, “That's wrong!” Everything is so meticulously choreographed and designed. You will have seen the openings in the floor and things coming up, and we can't leave anything in the wrong place on stage, because it could be covering a trap on the floor, and then they'd have to do a show stop because they can't go into the next scene if we've left something there by accident. Have you had to do show stops? There's a moment with the career tributes where a campfire comes up and someone had accidentally left a prop on it, so they couldn't bring the campfire up. And then when Rue comes on and she's like, “The smoke from the campfire!” it's kind of like, ‘Oh, this doesn't make sense.' And something happened with the wire so he couldn't get down. But it's really important for him to get Clove off me in that scene. There's no other way we could go about it. Are you just told to stay put? Yeah, sometimes you feel like you're so into it, and then it's like, ‘Wait, did I just hear something?' There's some crackers when you're in the Capitol. And then the chariot one is really cool as well. So then when I do get onto the chariot, me and Euan, who plays Peeta, we literally get plugged into it so that the smoke can come out of us and we light up. I'm assuming you are not scared of heights… I mean, in tech rehearsals, sometimes when we do it with the house lights on, that would scare me more in a way. But when it's dark, I've got so many other things to think about when I'm that high up. Has anyone famous come to see the show? And then in the beginning of act one, I went off for a quick change, and someone was like, “Ian McKellen's here.” But I was so confused… Euan was like, “He's on this row. And then on press night, Lily Allen came, which was really cool, because at the time we were all listening to her new album on repeat. Did you get to meet any of them after the show? We went and told our company manager, Kate, that Ian McKellen was there. Then after the show, she went up to him and said, “The cast would love to get a picture.” So he came and met us backstage. I should, because I've spoken a lot to Josh [Lacey], who plays Haymitch [in the production]. In this play, we have a lot of Easter eggs to the other books. When Effie says, “Happy Birthday!” to Haymitch and things like that. It was a few months before I did the audition for this, it was a film called Let's Love by Jamie Adams. It was an improv film, and I just had a small role, but I had a scene with him. In [the scene], I had to get a picture with him. Finally, then, when does the show end? Most of our contracts are for a year. What would the dream be for after this? And if it did go to Broadway or New York, I'd so be like, “Please take me!” That'd be so fun. But no, I'd love to do TV and film as well and I still would love to do stage. But I think because of how fulfilling this role is, I'd want to do something that really fulfilled me in every aspect.
