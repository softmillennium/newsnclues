                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The research, titled "Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi Games' Affordance of Childlike Wonder and Reduced Burnout Risk in Young Adults: In-Depth Mixed Methods Cross-Sectional Study," found that these lighthearted, familiar games can spark a sense of childlike wonder that boosts overall happiness, which in turn reduces burnout risk. The research team conducted in-depth interviews with university students and a survey to understand how and why these games resonate. Many said the games offered a refreshing break from academic pressure, constant digital demands, and the broader "always-on" culture affecting today's young adults. Those who felt greater childlike wonder while playing also reported higher overall happiness. In turn, happier players showed significantly lower burnout risk. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that happiness fully explained-rather than simply contributed to-the link between wonder and burnout reduction. In essence, the joy sparked by these games initiates a chain reaction that helps promote emotional well-being. The study, led by researchers at Imperial College London and Kyushu Sangyo University, is among the first to identify childlike wonder as a psychological pathway linking everyday gameplay to mental well-being. This research suggests that familiar, creatively designed games can serve as accessible, low-pressure digital microenvironments, offering emotional reset moments. Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games may provide an easy entry point for university students seeking moments of genuine restoration. Games like Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi may offer a potent antidote to the cynicism and fatigue characteristic of burnout." Games that evoke childlike wonder may hold untapped potential as tools for mental wellness. For young adults navigating high stress and limited downtime, everyday play may quietly support resilience in ways previously overlooked.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In low-resource regions such as Nigeria, most people with colorectal cancer are diagnosed too late for curative treatment options. A community awareness campaign in the country helped clinicians detect both early-stage and advanced colorectal cancer in patients who had not been aware that they should be screened. That's according to a study published by Wiley online in CANCER, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society. These materials were distributed during community events, clinic visits, and through religious institutions. Among 497 participants, 322 completed surveys both before and after the campaign. Good knowledge of colorectal cancer risk factors and symptoms also increased significantly. Individuals with indicators of colorectal cancer based on baseline survey results were referred by health care workers and patient navigators to an Early Diagnosis Clinic. Among 329 individuals who went to the Early Diagnosis Clinic, 168 (51.1%) were identified as having risk factors for colorectal cancer (such as unexplained changes in bowel habits or anal ulcerations, or a family history of colorectal cancer), and 116 (73.0%) completed a colonoscopy. Precancerous polyps (advanced adenomas) were identified in 11% of the patients who underwent colonoscopy. This program is the first of its kind to demonstrate a program in sub-Saharan Africa that includes both community education and symptoms that trigger navigation to a colorectal cancer early diagnosis clinic to prevent cancer in patients with advanced adenomas and identify colorectal cancer in curable stages."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But what if the way we eat during these gatherings is shaped by more than just tradition? In fact, these influences are so profound that they can mean some people dread visiting family for the festivities. In an in-depth study of the psychology of eating, Professor in Health Psychology Jane Ogden delves into the profound impact of family dynamics on eating behavior, offering practical advice for fostering healthier relationships with food and each other. In her new book, How to Eat Well at Every Age, Professor Ogden highlights how the family you grew up with can shape your attitudes toward food for life. Children of all ages learn what and how much to eat from their parents. Up until the age of about 12, parents are their key role models. After this age, even if it starts to feel that their friends are more important and that we are losing our grip, secretly, they still watch what their parents do." This influence extends beyond food choices to attitudes about body image and exercise. Parents who model healthy eating and active lifestyles can set their children up for lifelong habits. So, families wield an impressive influence over our attitudes to food. Not only this, but eating socially has been shown to have a huge psychological impact on us too. For the most part, food can bring people together, improve wellbeing, and create lasting memories, Professor Ogden suggests. In fact, she emphasizes the benefits of eating together, suggesting food can encourage social interaction and improve mood: "Food can also help with wellbeing as it offers a source of pleasure, structure, and a useful excuse for spending time with friends and family." But what happens when those inherited attitudes about food are less than positive, and when a big family gathering means confronting some challenging attitudes about eating? It becomes more complex when we understand that some inherited beliefs about food and body image are not constructive, and food can also be used to manage emotions, especially during stressful family gatherings. For example, food can help regulate emotions like boredom, anxiety, or loneliness, which can be particularly difficult for someone who has worked hard to improve their relationship with eating. Another challenge people may face during festive food gatherings is the labeling of foods or eating habits as "good" or "bad," a language often passed down by older generations. Instead, she promotes a balanced approach, gently reframing foods as "frequent" versus "occasional" and focusing on moderation rather than restriction. "Try to talk about food in a way that reinforces eating when you are hungry and stopping when you are full, and does not make body size an issue," the expert advises. Despite possible comments or advice from relatives, Professor Ogden warns that strict food restrictions can backfire, leading to cravings, overeating, and feelings of guilt. This positive approach can help build a sustainable, balanced relationship with food. For those worried about overindulging during the holidays, she suggests self-compassion. For those who already have a complex relationship with food, and may be looking for ways to break that cycle with their own kids, Professor Ogden has advice. For those less concerned about judgemental comments, but more concerned about whether delicious home cooking could derail a healthy eating plan, she has advice there too. The book also warns against using food as a reward, which can teach children to associate unhealthy foods with pleasure. Instead, parents are encouraged to reward healthy eating with praise and smiles, fostering a preference for nutritious foods. The book advises parents to "eat healthy foods, do not snack, do not overeat, undereat and be seen to try new foods and enjoy them." At the other end of the spectrum, for those looking after an ageing relative who still lives independently but eats less, she advises: "We are an ageing population and this becomes a problem for many people as they see their parents get thinner and not eat properly. "Christmas can be the time to make sure they actually eat a homecooked meal." How to Eat Well at Every Age, by Jane Ogden.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But decades of antibiotic overuse—in hospitals, communities, and farms—have fueled a global surge in resistant microbes. These "superbugs" thrive where antibiotics are freely used and poorly regulated, spreading silently through humans, animals, and the environment. International monitoring has revealed sharp differences between countries, driven by distinct drug policies and healthcare systems. In developing regions, weak surveillance and over-the-counter antibiotic sales have worsened the crisis. Because of these challenges, researchers have turned to an urgent question: how can the world contain antimicrobial resistance (AMR) before it outpaces modern medicine? By revealing the molecular mechanisms and treatment challenges of AMR, it provides a scientific foundation for global action and highlights how strategic antibiotic use could slow the tide of resistance. The authors examined data from international surveillance programs such as CARS, SENTRY, and One Health Trust-ResistanceMap, uncovering striking global variations. The notorious Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are particularly difficult to treat, showing resistance levels of over 70% in some regions. In contrast, northern Europe reports single-digit rates, reflecting effective stewardship. On the fungal front, Candida auris has emerged as a near-pan-resistant pathogen, while Aspergillus fumigatus is evolving azole resistance, partly driven by agricultural fungicide use. In response, the authors recommend individualized treatment guided by pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, including the use of β-lactamase inhibitors, tigecycline, and polymyxin-based combinations. Our review shows that resistance patterns are constantly shifting, shaped by human behavior, healthcare systems, and environmental factors. What's needed is a unified One Health strategy that bridges medicine, agriculture, and ecology. Only by strengthening surveillance, optimizing antibiotic use, and fostering innovation can we prevent a future where routine infections once again become deadly." The authors call for coordinated international surveillance, tighter prescription controls, and responsible use of antibiotics in agriculture. Hospitals must embrace genomic diagnostics and AI-assisted decision systems to tailor therapies in real time. Investment in next-generation antimicrobials and β-lactamase inhibitors is equally urgent. Beyond drugs, education and policy reform are key to preserving the efficacy of existing treatments. If global collaboration succeeds, the tide of resistance can still be turned—securing the foundation of modern medicine for generations to come.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wasatch BioLabs (WBL), a leader in native, long-read sequencing and epigenomic analysis, today announced a co-marketing agreement with Agilent Technologies to support the adoption of its Direct Targeted Methylation Sequencing (dTMS) platform. The collaboration brings together Agilent's enrichment chemistries – SureSelect for genomic DNA and Avida for cell-free DNA – and WBL's proprietary Oxford Nanopore-based native-read workflow, expanding access to scalable targeted multi-omic analysis for RUO and clinical research studies. The SureSelect and Avida capabilities both fill a critical gap in native-read sequencing by enabling precise, custom targeting up to 1 Mb, while preserving native DNA features such as methylation and structural variants. By eliminating off-target sequencing, DNA damage of traditional bisulfite-based methods, and biases introduced by PCR amplification, researchers can capture true biology across large and short, customized genomic regions. Multi-omic biology is essential for understanding disease, but for broad adoption it has to be delivered in a way that scales. Dean Lilley, Senior Director of Product Development, Wasatch BioLabs Early adopters in oncology, neurology, rare disease, and prenatal research are already applying dTMS to resolve structural variation, allelic context, repeat expansions, and methylation patterns in a unified assay. These programs demonstrate how native-read targeted sequencing can support more comprehensive, mechanism-informed profiling across research areas such as liquid biopsy and large cohort studies. "Partnering with Wasatch BioLabs allows Agilent to deliver a next-generation experience for customers who need both innovation and operational flexibility," said Nina Green, vice president and general manager of Agilent's Clinical Diagnostics Division. "By integrating SureSelect and Avida enrichment with Wasatch's novel sequencing technology and robust send-out service model, we are enabling customers to access high-quality NGS data without workflow barriers. This collaboration accelerates adoption, improves turnaround times, and provides a powerful, innovation-led path to achieving high-confidence genomic insights at any scale."
