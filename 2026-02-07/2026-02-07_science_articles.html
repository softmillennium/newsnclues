The Rab11 endosomal recycling pathway is exploited by important respiratory RNA viruses such as IAV and RSV, aiding viral egress from the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells. Late in infection, Rab11-containing vesicles specifically transport viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes towards the cell surface before packaging and budding. Rather than employing traditional Rab11-positive recycling endosomes, virus-infected cells generate remodelled Rab11-containing vesicles, as observed during IAV infection. Besides Rab11, no other conserved host co-factors have been identified among these various vRNP trafficking vesicles. Here we discover and confirm myoferlin's association with IAV vRNPs in the cytoplasm and colocalisation with Rab11 during late stages of infection. We also find that this role is conserved in late-stage vRNP trafficking of other viruses, including RSV and SeV. Myoferlin likely recruits the EHD family of proteins, which are involved in endosomal biogenesis, to these unique vRNP trafficking endosomes, highlighting myoferlin's pivotal role in viral replication.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Astronomers say the Milky Way may not contain a supermassive black hole at its center after all. Instead, the galaxy's core could be dominated by an enormous concentration of dark matter that produces the same powerful gravitational effects. This unseen material, which makes up most of the universe's total mass, may be able to explain two very different observations at once. Near the galaxy's center, stars move in fast, chaotic paths just light hours (often used to measure distances within our own solar system) from the core. These stars race around the galactic center at speeds reaching several thousand kilometres per second. The research team proposes that a specific form of dark matter made of fermions, which are lightweight subatomic particles, could instead form an unusual cosmic structure that fits what astronomers observe at the Milky Way's core. According to the model, this fermionic dark matter would naturally form a very dense and compact central core, surrounded by a much larger and more diffuse halo. Together, the core and halo would behave as a single, continuous system. A key piece of evidence comes from new observations by the European Space Agency's GAIA DR3 mission. They argue this strengthens the fermionic dark matter explanation. Standard Cold Dark Matter models predict halos that extend outward with a long power law tail. In contrast, the fermionic model produces a more compact halo with tighter outer edges. "This is the first time a dark matter model has successfully bridged these vastly different scales and various object orbits, including modern rotation curve and central stars data," said study co author Dr. Carlos Argüelles of the Institute of Astrophysics La Plata. The model had already cleared an important hurdle. In an earlier study by Pelle et al. (2024), also published in MNRAS, researchers showed that when an accretion disk shines light onto these dense dark matter cores, the result is a shadow like feature. The dense dark matter core can mimic the shadow because it bends light so strongly, creating a central darkness surrounded by a bright ring." More precise measurements from tools like the GRAVITY interferometer on the Very Large Telescope in Chile, along with searches for photon rings, could provide decisive evidence. Photon rings are expected around true black holes but would not appear in the dark matter core model. Note: Content may be edited for style and length.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What ‘6-7,' demons and The Big Bang Theory tell us about prime numbers Prime numbers have fascinated humankind for generations—here are three of the most intriguing primes For millennia, these numbers, divisible only by 1 and themselves, have fascinated humankind. They guard many secrets, including how they are distributed on the number line, and efforts to identify more and more primes have occupied generations of scholars. Euclid proved some 2,300 years ago that there are infinitely many prime numbers. And yet, some primes seem more interesting than others. I've compiled my personal short list of three extraordinary prime numbers and their stories. If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. A few years after the episode aired in 2010, mathematician Christopher Spicer of what is now Morningside University (then Morningside College) wondered if there were more “Sheldon primes” that shared these properties. In 2015 he worked with two of his then students, Jessie Byrnes and Alyssa Turnquist, to search the first 10 million prime numbers; they found no other Sheldon prime among them. Three years later, in 2019, Spicer and Carl Pomerance, a number theorist at Dartmouth College, showed conclusive proof that the Sheldon prime was unique. First, the researchers showed that there can be no Sheldon prime larger than 10⁴⁵. While 10⁴⁵ is unimaginably large, it is nonetheless a finite value, which means, in principle, a computer can systematically search all prime numbers between 2 and 10⁴⁵ for other Sheldon primes. Of course, today's computers aren't quite powerful enough to tackle that task directly. Anyone who was online in 2025 inevitably stumbled across the “6-7” phenomenon. The meme, pronounced “six-seven,” has no deeper meaning; it is not a code for sharing some message or expressing joy or annoyance. Sometimes it's attributed to a boy celebrating a basketball score; sometimes it's the rap song “Doot Doot (6 7),” by Skrilla. Occasionally people point to the height of basketball player LaMelo Ball: six feet, seven inches. The number 67 is certainly interesting from a mathematical perspective. And 67 is part of what mathematicians call the “lazy caterer's sequence,” which indicates the maximum number of pieces a pancake, pizza or other disk can be divided into with n cuts. But if the third cut is cleverly made, the disk can be cut into seven pieces instead of just six. With 11 cuts, a pancake can be divided into up to 67 pieces. You can easily add 0's between the 1 and the three 6's to this number for more beastly palindromes, such as 1,066,601, 100,666,001, 10,006,660,001, and so on. Only when there are 13 0's between each 1 and the 666 do you arrive at a prime number again. In shorter notation, this Belphegor prime number, which was named after a demon, can be written as 1030 + 666 × 1014 + 1. As it turns out, there are more palindromic primes of this form other than 16,661 and the Belphegor prime with 13 0's.
