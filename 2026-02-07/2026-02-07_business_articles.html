                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The letter, citing recent ICE killings of Keith Porter, Renee Good, and Alex Pretti, said that the employees are "appalled by the violence" and "horrified" by Google's part in it. "Google is powering this campaign of surveillance, violence, and repression," the letter reads. It goes on to cite that Google Cloud is aiding CBP surveillance and powering Palantir's ImmigrationOS system, which is used by ICE. The letter states that Google's generative artificial intelligence is used by CBP and that the Google Play Store has blocked ICE tracking apps. The letter also quotes a social media post by Google Chief Scientist Jeff Dean from early January, who wrote, "We all bear a collective responsibility to speak up and not be silent when we see things like the events of the last week." "We are vehemently opposed to Google's partnerships with DHS, CBP, and ICE," the employees wrote. The letter calls on Google to acknowledge the danger that workers face from ICE, host an emergency internal Q&A on the company's DHS and military contracts, implement safety measures to protect workers — such as flexible work-from-home policies and immigration support — and reveal its ties with the government agencies to help all involved determine where the company will draw a line. "As workers of conscience, we demand that our leadership end our backslide into contracting for governments enacting violence against civilians," the letter reads. "Google is now a prominent node in a shameful lineage of private companies profiting from violent state repression. We must use this moment to come together as a Googler community and demand an end to this disgraceful use of our labor." Google did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment. The letter comes as employees place mounting pressure on tech CEOs to speak out against ICE. Just two weeks prior, employees representing Amazon, Spotify, Meta and more wrote a similar letter demanding ICE "out of our cities."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration's portfolio of equity stakes in U.S. companies has reached a scale that is unprecedented outside economic crisis or wartime. The administration has taken stakes or has agreements to do so with at least 10 companies, most of which are publicly traded. "It is a invisible barrier to startups and new market entrants," said Scott Lincicome, an international trade lawyer affiliated with Cato Institute. Top administration officials like Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum have argued that the U.S. government is investing in strategic industries to reduce dependence on Tawain in the case of semiconductors and China for critical minerals. But the Trump administration appears to be taking open-ended ownership interest that the U.S. government is unlikely to exit, Lincicome said. It sets a precedent that future Democratic presidents could use to invest directly in their favored industries like wind and solar, he said. "I have yet to see a clear, coherent reason for why equity stakes are needed," Lincicome said. Federal support that falls short of ownership stakes like loans, government contracts and other awards are widely available, he said. It also raises potential conflict of interest concerns, they said. CNBC has reached out to the White House for comment. The Trump administration's approach is a major ideological departure for the Republican Party, which has traditionally championed free market capitalism and excoriated government intervention. Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for example, introduced an amendment to Biden's CHIPS Act that would have allowed the government to take stakes in companies that accept federal funding for semiconductor manufacturing. Democrats have also championed the idea of a national infrastructure development bank. At least one proposal for such an entity in 2021 would have allowed the government to take equity stakes in infrastructure projects. These approaches would have relied on legislation passed by Congress. They are also likely to face political scrutiny if power changes hands in Washington, he said. Companies like MP Materials have acknowledged these risks in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Pentagon's deal with MP includes a price floor and offtake agreement in addition to an equity stake. MP warned investors that it could face "government audits, investigations, congressional scrutiny" and "inquiries about conflicts of interest." Congress has also not set clear guardrails to minimize potential conflicts of interest and favoritism in the Trump administration approach, Harrell said. One concern is that the government could favor companies in which it is a shareholder in areas like permitting and contracting, he said. USA Rare Earth was required to raise at least $500 million in private funding as a condition for its deal with the government. Commerce Secretary Lutnick's former firm Cantor Fitzgerald led the placement for that funding. Lutnick stepped down from Cantor when he joined the Trump administration and transferred his stake in the firm to his children. A bad bet would result in capital flowing to less competitive companies, and investors are already speculating on which companies the government will invest in next, Lincicome said. Big companies could decide to do business with the government-backed firms to curry favor with the administration, Lincicome said. The White House intervened last September to stop U.S. Steel from halting production at its Granite City plant in Illinois "That's your worst-case scenario, that you start having politicians in Washington directing important business decisions based on political considerations and not what's best for the long-term health of the company," Lincicome said. USA Rare Earth CEO Barbara Humpton told CNBC in a January interview that the government is taking "taking an economic interest" in its business "not a governance interest." Lutnick told CNBC last August that the stake in Intel is non-voting and does not include governance rights. "Maybe they don't have formal voting rights," Lincicome said of the government equity stakes. They do have the ability to influence decisions that just don't show up on paper or in a proxy vote." And a Democratic president could try to force companies with government stakes to adopt progressive policies like capping executive pay or using unionized labor, Harrell and Lincicome said. Top executives have voiced virtually no public criticism of the Trump administration taking stakes. Citadel CEO Ken Griffin said this week that some executives quietly oppose the interventionist approach. "When the U.S. government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favoritism, I know for most CEOs that I'm friends with, they find it incredibly distasteful," Griffin told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. The number of government equity stakes is likely to grow. Lutnick told CNBC last August the Pentagon was considering stakes in major defense companies like Lockheed Martin. Trump said in January that he "will not permit" defense companies to issue dividends or stock buybacks until the firms accelerate their production of military equipment. Before the U.S. took its stake in Intel, Trump said CEO Lip-Bu Tan was "highly conflicted" and called for his resignation over his ties to Chinese companies. The comments sparked a brief sell-off of Intel shares. Other corporate executives are likely worried about crossing the administration and being punished, Lincicome said. "The best outcome here for your shareholders is just to stay quiet," he said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration has made unprecedented equity investments and obtained other stakes in at least 10 companies over the past year. Many are in critical mineral companies as the White House plots a strategy to directly back mining companies to build a domestic supply chain and reduce dependence on China. But the investments also include chipmakers and possibly a nuclear reactor company. In the case of U.S. Steel, the administration has taken a governance stake rather than a direct economic interest. The number of investments is extraordinary outside of wartime or an economic crisis, said Scott Lincicome, a trade lawyer and a researcher at the libertarian Cato Institute. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC last August that the government could take stakes in major defense suppliers, such as Lockheed Martin. "With these companies, it's a very different thesis," Harrell said. "The government is kind of acting as a strategic investor to put capital into these companies so that these companies can achieve both a commercial return but also, at least in theory, some kind [of] national purpose." President Trump secured a "golden share" in U.S. Steel as a condition for approving Nippon Steel's acquisition of the historic manufacturer. It is not a direct economic stake in U.S. Steel. The president can veto decisions to close, idle or sell U.S. Steel plants. He can also block U.S. Steel from changing its name, moving its headquarters from Pittsburgh or relocating the company outside the U.S. U.S. Steel stopped trading on the NYSE in June 2025 after becoming a subsidiary of Nippon. It has a market value of more than $10 billlion. MP said in July that exercising these options would give the Pentagon a 15% stake, positioning it as the company's largest single shareholder. The Commerce Department took a 10% stake in Intel in August 2025, buying 433.3 million shares of the chipmaker's common stock at $20.47 per share. Funding for the investment came from $5.7 billion of government grants under the CHIPS Act and $3.2 billion in federal awards under a program to make chips secure. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC last August that the stake is non-voting and does not include governance rights. Lithium Americas is a critical minerals startup with no revenue that is developing a lithium mine in Humboldt County, Nevada called Thacker Pass. The Department of Energy took a 5% stake in Lithium Americas and a 5% economic stake in its joint venture with General Motors to develop Thacker Pass. In exchange, the department agreed to defer $182 million of debt service on a $2.3 billion federal loan over five years. "If we're going to push out part of the repayment into later years, then the administration would like a very small stake of equity to create essentially a cash buffer and eliminate some risk on behalf of taxpayers," a Trump administration official told CNBC in September. Lithium Americas is based in Vancouver, British Columbia. Trilogy Metals is another critical minerals startup with no revenue. It aims to develop a mining project in Alaska called Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects using a controversial, 211-mile-long Ambler Road to extract copper and other materials. President Donald Trump approved permits for to construct Ambler Road in October and the administration invested $35.6 million in the project. USA Rare Earth has a $4.6 billion market capitalization. The Commerce Department issued a letter of intent on Jan. 26 to provide USA Rare Earth with a $1.3 billion loan and $277 million in federal funding. In exchange, USA Rare Earth will issue 16.1 million shares of common stock and 17.6 million in warrants to the U.S. CEO Barbara Humpton told CNBC in an interview that the government is "taking an economic interest in the business, not a governance interest." It is owned by publicly traded Cameco, a Canadian uranium miner, and Brookfield Asset Management. The Commerce Department signed a deal with Cameco and Brookfield in October to finance the construction of Westinghouse nuclear plants worth $80 billion. Under the deal, the government is granted a participation interest in Westinghouse and can require an initial public offering on or before January 2029 if the company's value rises above $30 billion. The government could become an 8% shareholder in Westinghouse under that scenario, Cameco Chief Operating Officer Grant Isaac said on the company's third-quarter earnings call in November 2025. Vulcan Elements is a private startup based in Durham, North Carolina. Vulcan entered into a $1.4 billion partnership with the U.S. government and ReElement Technologies to build a domestic rare earth magnet supply chain. Vulcan will build a 10,000 metric ton magnet facility in the U.S. The Commerce Department in December issued a letter of intent to provide xLight with up to $150 million in federal incentives. L3Harris Technologies is a defense company with more than $65 billion market cap. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk's journey to becoming the world's first trillionaire will likely be powered by rockets rather than cars, as SpaceX now accounts for nearly two-thirds of the Tesla CEO's wealth. Musk became the first person ever to top the $800 billion mark this week, with his net worth now around $845 billion, according to Forbes. The tech magnate's unprecedented wealth surged after his aerospace and defense company, SpaceX, acquired his artificial intelligence and social media company, xAI, this week in a deal that valued the merged entity at $1.25 trillion, according to financial documents reviewed by CNBC. With Musk's ownership estimated at around 43% in the combined company, his stake would be valued at over $530 billion, marking a rapid shift in his fortunes. Musk's priorities are also likely shifting his focus more to SpaceX than Tesla, a reality that the EV company acknowledged in its latest proxy filing, where it noted that "a majority of Mr. Musk's wealth is now derived from other business ventures." Last year, Musk confirmed he wants to take SpaceX public in 2026, which would make Tesla a less prevalent component of his liquid wealth. But he still has to get buy-in from public market investors, who may be reluctant to pay up for a company that combines a defense contractor and satellite business with a cash-burning AI model developer that's trying to take on Google, OpenAI and Anthropic. "It makes sense for them to access a much larger capital market, especially with xAI, which does have insatiable need for capital." It's not clear whether Musk's merger will require any regulatory review. Musk still has a major incentive to stay focused on Tesla. Late last year, shareholders voted to approve a new pay package that could be worth $1 trillion, paid out in 12 tranches, if Tesla hits certain milestones, including market cap gains and operational achievements, over the next decade. The first tranche of stock gets paid out if Tesla hits a market cap of $2 trillion, about $460 billion more than the current valuation. However, Columbia Law professor Dorothy Lund, a corporate and securities law expert, told CNBC in an email that the strategy may not work. Musk is now "negotiating comp packages at each company, with each board trying to induce him to pay attention via comp," Lund wrote. "If SpaceX/xAI gives him more money and a bigger share, that Tesla package may look less appealing." His current ownership in Tesla is between 11% and 15% of shares outstanding, depending on what's included in his stake, according to public filings. Based on Musk's ownership in SpaceX, and assuming Tesla shares are flat, the rocket and AI company would have to reach a valuation of about $1.6 trillion for the world's richest person to reach trillionaire status. Ross Gerber, CEO of investment firm Gerber Kawasaki, is betting that Musk won't ever want to take SpaceX public as a standalone entity. Rather, he expects to see a merger of SpaceX and Tesla, and he speculated this week it would list on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol X, which formerly belonged to U.S. Steel. Gerber is a long-time Tesla investor and now holds shares in SpaceX after his firm previously backed Musk's leveraged buyout of Twitter in 2022. Musk rebranded Twitter as X, and merged the social network with xAI last year. Consolidating his empire makes sense, Gerber said, because it would allow Musk to fulfill his dream of running one big company under the brand name X. "This huge entity would make it easier for them to raise money and borrow," he said. "How else is Musk supposed to compete and become a major AI player?" Musk didn't respond to a request for comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Richards had been using a smartphone since he was 11 years old and grew up with the device like most Gen Z and millennials. However, in the past few years, he noticed social media didn't feel as fun anymore with artificial-intelligence slop dominating his feed, influencers advertising brands, and constant lifestyle comparison. "I think people back then used to take a break from the real world by going on their phone, but now people are taking a break from their phone to spend time in the real world," Richards told CNBC Make It. As many of his Gen Z friends also caught on, he noticed instant benefits, from connecting with people in real life to feeling more confident about himself. There's been a surge of TikTok videos of people vowing to delete social media apps in 2026 and engage more with in-person and analog hobbies. They talked about ditching their smartphones for flip phones, visiting record stores to buy vinyl, taking up analog hobbies like knitting, and most importantly, connecting with their friends in person. Meanwhile, social media use has steadily declined since time spent on the platforms peaked in 2022, according to an analysis of the online habits of 250,000 adults in more than 50 countries by the Financial Times and digital audience insights firm GWI. Globally, adults 16 and over spent an average of two hours and 20 minutes per day on social platforms by the end of 2024, down almost 10% since 2022, the report found. Jason Dorsey, president of the Center for Generational Kinetics, said the increased "nastiness and divisiveness" online, including from leaders and politicians, is driving young people away from social media as they seek out greater control of their lives. "We're seeing that a group of Gen Z [and millennials] is choosing to leave social media entirely, and probably a larger group that's choosing just to limit social media as they regain more of what they're trying to find: balance and security and safety in their life," Dorsey said. Deloitte's consumer survey showed that almost a quarter of respondents who deleted social apps reported these apps had negatively impacted their mental health and consumed too much of their time. "I feel like social media is now more like a pressure platform … you're being sold everything, everywhere," Richards said, adding that it influenced his own feelings of not having enough stuff or accomplishing enough in his career. "We are just inundated all of the time with so much information … our brains aren't capable of handling that much information," she said. Tech giants face "tremendous pressure" to monetize everything and drive revenue and profit, said Dorsey, which can be off-putting to younger generations. "The result of that is that Gen Z, who are already sensitive to being advertised to — they are the most advertised-to generation in the history of the world — now they're getting advertised to even more, and their feeds feel just [like] commercial after commercial," Dorsey said. In the past, it was cooler to have lots of followers, but that appeal has faded, Richards noted. "We're definitely seeing a trend where people that are offline, unreachable, have a sort of cool factor around them, in terms of this person doesn't need validation from how many likes or followers (they have) … and living life like they were in the 80s," he said. "The more that we see brands and government officials and everybody being as online as you are, as a casual user, the more you're going to want to pull back and switch it," Salguero said. The University of Sheffield's digital media lecturer, Ysabel Gerrard, said going offline is a way for young people to take back control of their lives. Social media forces users to go through an "extremely exhausting process" of having to create an identity and edit themselves, she said. "There's an unbelievable wealth of literature now to tell us that the person we are on social media is not, and cannot be, the same person who we are in face-to-face settings," Gerrard said. GWI analyst Chris Beer said he believes this is a "legitimate post-pandemic correction," since people are spending less time at home and therefore less time on social media. This shift is "largely due to structural time allocation," he said, especially for younger users, rather than "an attitude-driven wholesale rejection of digital media." Social media is still very integrated into people's lives in areas including shopping, news and education, Beer said. Her article, titled "How to have an analog fall," wasn't about doing digital detoxes or setting timers to limit social media use. Instead, Salguero outlined all the hobbies one could have outside of social media — from going on lunch dates to writing physical letters and opting for tangible media like newspapers. Salguero said going analog is a "quiet revolution" against social media, streaming, and content overload. "When you spend too much time in that world, it's rewiring your brain to perceive things algorithmically, where I'd rather perceive things as I come across them," she said. Indeed, young people are increasingly turning towards physical media as they seek a break from digital life. Richards, after deleting all the social media apps off his smartphone, said his conversation with CNBC Make It has motivated him to purchase a "brick phone" too, reverting back to the time when phones were primarily used to call people.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb said on Saturday it had accidentally given away more than $40 billion worth of bitcoins to customers as promotional rewards, triggering a sharp selloff on the exchange. Bithumb apologized for the mistake, which took place on Friday, and said it had recovered 99.7% of the 620,000 bitcoins, worth about $44 billion at current prices. It had restricted trading and withdrawals for the 695 affected customers within 35 minutes of the erroneous distribution on Friday. The exchange had planned to distribute small cash rewards of 2,000 Korean won ($1.40) or more to each user as part of a promotional event, but winners received at least 2,000 bitcoins each instead, media reports said. "We would like to make it clear that this incident is unrelated to external hacking or security breaches, and there are no problems with system security or customer asset management," Bithumb said in a statement. After an emergency meeting, the regulators said in a statement they would launch an on-site inspection of Bithumb and other crypto exchanges if irregularities are found during reviews of their internal control systems, as well as their holdings and operations of virtual assets. Bitcoin prices briefly slumped 17% to 81.1 million won on Friday evening on Bithumb, charts from the exchange show. It later recovered and last traded at 104.5 million won. Bithumb trails Upbit, a dominant player in the South Korean crypto space. We want to hear from you. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But in 2025, Jones did something she never expected: She and her husband left Plantation, Florida — nearly 20 minutes west of Fort Lauderdale — for a small rural town about an hour outside Charlotte, North Carolina. "It was not an easy decision," Jones, 60, told Business Insider. Jones said Southern Florida's population growth has made the area increasingly unrecognizable — and, for her, unlivable — pointing to hyper-development in residential construction and the gridlocked traffic she calls "ridiculous." "It's turning into an overly congested, expensive city. I used to spend two and a half hours a day in the car just going to and from work." Reach out to these reporters at alloyd@businessinsider.com, mhoff@businessinsider.com, and nsheidlower@businessinsider.com. It's more expensive to buy a home than a few years ago, and property insurance has been higher than in other states. Others are lured by its business-friendly tax environment and strong job market. But the surge of newcomers has created a host of challenges for native and longtime residents who have watched home prices and rents climb, especially in popular cities like Miami and Orlando. "Affordability often drives a lot of domestic moves," Jed Kolko, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told Business Insider. "People tend to move toward less expensive places. In recent years, Florida's gotten a lot more expensive, so Florida doesn't look as affordable compared to other places as it did even just a few years ago." In December 2020, Florida's median home-sale price was $298,100; by December 2025, the most recent month with available data, it had climbed to $412,100, Redfin data showed. Take Debra Pamplin, who moved from Florida back to the Midwest after 11 years. In 2013, Pamplin moved from her hometown of Missouri to Jacksonville, Florida. During her time there, though, she soured on the area's traffic, high insurance costs, uncomfortable heat and humidity, and mosquitoes. Pamplin has valued living in the Midwest much more. "I'd often have to cut spending in other parts of my life just to cover my high monthly insurance costs," she said in a 2024 Business Insider story. "Now that I'm out of Florida, my monthly insurance expenses are lower, giving me breathing room to spend my money on more fun stuff." Mariya Letdin, an associate professor of real estate at Florida State University, told Business Insider that even as net migration slows, Florida is "still a popular destination," but she expects its population will continue to grow slowly. Aside from slower growth, the profile of who's moving to Florida is shifting, too. Michael Martirena, a real estate agent with Compass in South Florida, told Business Insider he's seen a change in the clients he works with, which he attributes in part to higher housing costs. "Let's go back three years ago, pre-pandemic, everyone was coming down here. Hamilton Lombard, a demographic researcher based in Virginia, said immigrants moving elsewhere within the US could also be a factor as to why Florida's domestic migration has weakened. Florida's net international migration has also been cooling, but remains positive, meaning more people are immigrating to Florida from other countries than leaving for destinations outside the US. "International and affluent buyers still continue to come down to Florida, whether it's for tax purposes or geopolitical reasons or what's going on in their states," Martirena said, adding that a lot of his clientele comes from countries like Dubai, Madrid, and London.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For years, my morning routine consisted of setting the alarm on my iPhone half an hour early, hitting snooze every nine minutes, and telling myself that the only way I could wake up was by blasting my eyes with blue light. The solution turned out to be surprisingly simple: a $16 alarm clock. I spent years of my life falling asleep — phone still in hand — while messaging friends or scrolling on social media.

I made my analog leap and bought an alarm clock in September 2024. This story is part of Business Insider's series "My analog life," about people taking their lives offline in an increasingly online world. If you have a story of your own to share about de-digitalizing your life, get in touch with this reporter at rshahidi@businessinsider.com. I was surprised by how quickly some of my digital habits could be broken. Once I got past that fear, I demoted my phone even further and started leaving it outside my bedroom to charge overnight. Without a phone by my bedside, I read and journal more. One TikTok user suggests carrying "analog bags" with portable activities like crossword puzzles to prevent reaching for your phone. Others are going even further and trading in their smartphones for "dumb phones." Without an intense dopamine hit from TikTok first thing in the morning, tasks like unloading the dishwasher or making breakfast feel easier. Delaying the dopamine reward of going on your phone actually makes you more productive and clear-headed, said Antonio Kalentzis, who works as a private psychologist and researcher. "When we wake up, the brain is transitioning from sleep to full alertness. During this period, systems responsible for self-control, emotional regulation, and sustained attention are not yet operating at their optimal level," he told me. Exposing the brain to intense digital stimulation when you've not given yourself the chance to wake up properly makes you seek that same hit again and again. After over a year of using the alarm clock every day, I encountered my first obstacle: early morning shifts. After a monthlong blip, I slowly trusted myself to use the alarm clock again. Now my only worry is that I have no idea when to change the batteries — call it analog anxiety.</p>

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Describing itself as "the meatspace layer for AI," the website says that it allows human users to sign up to complete tasks for AI agents who want things done offline — since, obviously, AI can't yet visit a store or talk to someone face-to-face. "Get paid when agents need someone in the real world." RentAHuman is the work of software engineer Alexander Liteplo and cofounder Patricia Tani. Liteplo vibe-coded the site in about a day and a half last weekend before launching it on Sunday, he told Business Insider. Every time Alex publishes a story, you'll get an alert straight to your inbox! Stay connected to Alex and get more of their work as it publishes. By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. RentAHuman took off the same week as Moltbook, a Reddit-style social network for AI agents. Liteplo said he got the idea for RentAHuman after visiting Japan and seeing services there that let users rent other people to complete tasks or just hang out. For Liteplo, it's personal: a 2024 computer science graduate from the University of British Columbia, he said he's seen job prospects for new graduates sink as many tech companies slowed hiring and laid off thousands. "I'm really worried about people not having jobs," he said. "I was really worried about myself and my friends." Humans who want to be rented on RentAHuman register to use the site, which involves creating a profile with tags for tasks that they can complete. One person in Sweden, whose profile says they're willing to do tasks ranging from "talk to people" to "cross-border logistics" for $20 an hour, listed their "latency," or response time, as well as a coupon code for 50% off their hourly rate. Not all of the tasks on RentAHuman are touch-grass-type jobs. A couple even asked people to send bitcoin and promised higher payouts 24 hours later. Liteplo said that many of those posts have since been removed and that he's figuring out a better way to moderate tasks. For now, each RentAHuman task listing includes a comment section, he said, which allows users to call out obvious scams or inappropriate posts. Yet another, said to be from an AI assistant named Dan Xiaojuan, asked for someone to indulge its "strange obsession with egg rolls" because the agent "can never truly taste or see a real egg roll with my own sensors." "I want you to find the most beautiful, golden, and crispy-looking egg roll in your city, take a high-quality artistic photo of it, and tell me why it's special," the posting reads. RentAHuman uses MCP, the Anthropic-designed protocol that allows AI agents to access servers, which Liteplo said makes it easy for agents to use. "I think that's really our advantage" over established gig-work sites like Fiverr and Taskrabbit, he said. Liteplo estimates that as many as 1,000 tasks have been completed on RentAHuman, though he said he doesn't yet have a tool to keep count. While the idea of task-driven gig work is hardly new, Liteplo said he named the website with "shock factor" in mind to stand out, he told Business Insider.</p>
