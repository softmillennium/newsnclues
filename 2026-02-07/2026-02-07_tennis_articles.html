Other milestones for the former Roland Garros junior doubles champion followed, including: She doubled her career total of Top 20 wins against World No. 11 Alexandrova, as she pulled away from the No. 2 seed in 1 hour and 39 minutes after a tense first set. While Bejlek led for much of it, Alexandrova looked on course to turn things around after saving two set points in the 12th game. But Bejlek, who won the first set in each of her prior matches, was not about to let that streak go, and won five of the final six points to take it. 75 in November of last year, Bejlek will blast past that into the Top 50 of the PIF WTA Rankings next week.
