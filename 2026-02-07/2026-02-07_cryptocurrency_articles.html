                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The company continues to frame its large Ethereum position and staking operations as part of a long term treasury approach, while continuing to accumulate ETH. Recent executive turnover, including the amicable separation of President Erik Nelson, is adding another layer of uncertainty for shareholders during heightened crypto market volatility. These moves follow a very large 1 year gain and a 96.6% decline over 5 years, which together highlight how tightly the company is tied to crypto market swings. The combination of a large Ethereum treasury, nearly $8b in unrealized losses, and leadership changes is likely to keep attention on how BitMine Immersion Technologies manages risk and liquidity. Investors may focus on how the company explains its long term ETH accumulation and staking plans, and what that could mean for BMNR shares if crypto volatility continues.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's rout is far from over, according to veteran commodities trader Peter Brandt. Over the past week, Bitcoin has dropped as much as 17% from over $90,000 to around $74,600 as markets weighed the nomination of former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh for chair of the central bank, escalating geopolitical tensions and a partial U.S. government shutdown. Amid the market uncertainty, recent posts from Brandt suggest that Bitcoin is likely to continue its decline to trade between $58,000 and $54,000, 54% and 57% below its record price of $126,000 in October. The AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share Professional traders demand transparency — see why Kraken Pro has become one of crypto's most trusted advanced trading platforms. However, Brandt on Monday shared another daily candle chart showing Bitcoin on Jan. 25 had broken out of a bearish channel it has been stuck in since November to the downside, setting a target of $54,000. The platform offers advanced order type and deep liquidity to help users execute complex strategies with precision. As for when this potential price bottom could materialize, Brandt on Jan. 29 suggested between August and October. "BTC to bottom in Aug-Oct then straight up," he said on X. Meanwhile, Brandt on Monday also appeared to question whether investors in pioneer Bitcoin treasury company Strategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) can hold on for the ride. "When on this journey will investors want to start jumping from the Sayl_boat?" "MS will do just great, but what about his investors?"

Still, the company on Monday announced the purchase of 855 BTC for approximately $75.3 million at an average price of $87,974 per coin, bringing its stash to 713,502 BTC. Along with Bitcoin's teetering price, Strategy's stock has tanked by more than 53% over the past year, most recently trading at $144.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After plunging to nearly $60,000 per coin this week, Bitcoin regained ground and briefly touched above $70,000 on Friday. By Saturday morning in New York, it was trading a little over $69,000, according to CoinGecko. But it's looking bleak for major digital tokens dubbed hot trades just a month ago after the altcoin market bore the brunt of this week's selloff. The biggest losers this week include privacy coin Monero, down nearly 31% over a seven-day period, and President Trump-backed World Liberty Financial, which has continued its slide to lose over 31% of its value this week. Monero was recently priced at $325 after recovering by 4%; World Liberty Financial dropped even further — shedding 10% of its value over a 24-hour period. Just one month ago, privacy coins were supposed to be the go-to trade for crypto speculators. That trade came undone with this week's crash, though. Dash is down 19% over the past week, priced at nearly $37. But privacy coins weren't the only category to get pummelled. It was recently trading for $3.39 and continued to drop on Saturday morning New York time. It was trading for a little over $86 on Saturday — more than 70% below its 2025 all-time high. Ethereum also took a beating this week and is down nearly 22% over that time frame. Investors were also spooked over Trump's Federal Reserve chair nomination last week: Kevin Warsh — who's typically been an inflation hawk in the past. It wasn't just crypto markets that got hit hard: Precious metals and stocks also experienced increased volatility this week.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin has recovered from a low near $60,000 to now stand around $69,000, having effectively given back the gains it made after Donald Trump's election in November 2024 this week. The cryptocurrency's drop was accompanied by a broader market sell-off that saw the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index lose more than 17% of its value in a week. While bitcoin dropped around 16.5% in the last 7-day period, other cryptocurrencies fared worse. The sell-off was driven by market-wide liquidations and what “felt like a ‘sell at any price' working order,” said Jasper De Maere, desk strategist and OTC trader at Wintermute in an emailed statement. De Maere added that the cascade came alongside a wider cross-asset deleveraging. In crypto options, implied volatility jumped into the 99th percentile, with skew tilting toward unusually expensive puts, he said. In bitcoin, he said positioning pointed to expectations of continued turbulence, with traders focused on a wide range that could run from about $55,000 to $75,000. Further hitting sentiment, this week crypto exchange Gemini said it plans to shutter operations in the U.K., European Union and Australia, and cut about 25% of staff as part of a restructuring.The firm will enter withdrawal-only mode for users in affected regions and partner with brokerage platform eToro for users to transfer their assets. Bitcoin's average 1% market depth, a measure of how much can be traded near the current price without moving the market, has fallen to around $5 million from more than $8 million in 2025, Kaiko research analyst Thomas Probst told Reuters. Data from SoSoValue shows about $1.25 billion of net outflows over the past three days. Jim Bianco of Bianco Research estimated on social media that the average ETF cost basis is near $90,000, leaving holders with about $15 billion in unrealized losses. If so, BTC should trade like a software stock,” Bianco said in an X post, adding that the recent decline shows it is trading alongside software stocks. Software stocks tumbled this week after Anthropic released a new automation tool for its AI models targeting legal and other knowledge-focused workflows. BTIG chief market technician Jonathan Krinsky also said bitcoin has been correlated with software stocks lately. “There's some pretty compelling evidence both of those [bitcoin and software stocks] have put in tactical lows,” Krinsky said during an interview with CNBC. “[Bitcoin] bottomed last night right around $60,000 so I think that's a pretty good level to trade against.” “On the upside you really need to see it back above $73,000, that was the key breakdown level, that would kind of confirm a tradable low is certainly in,” he added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Discussion among industry participants is all about pressing concerns like supply chain, ESG, and data integrity where the focus is no longer on coins, but on credibility. Companies are under growing pressure to measure “Scope 3” emissions, the indirect carbon output tied to suppliers, logistics and product use. Disputes between suppliers over data accuracy are common, making verification a major challenge. According to the World Economic Forum, just eight global supply chains generate more than 50% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions and this concentration has intensified scrutiny on procurement networks spanning hundreds or even thousands of vendors. For large corporations, the lack of consistent, trusted data across these networks has become both a regulatory and reputational risk. Consulting firms like Deloitte describe blockchain as a shared digital ledger that allows multiple parties to log and review data without retroactive tampering. Companies are betting on blockchain beyond crypto as pressure mounts to prove trust, trace emissions and secure data around 70–90% of corporate emissions come from Scope 3 sources, while the World Economic Forum estimates eight supply chains generate over 50% of global emissions. Blockchain offers tamper-resistant records that help track complex supplier data. In retail pilots, traceability tasks dropped from days to seconds, cutting risk and costs with global ESG reporting spend projected to exceed $15 billion annually, firms see blockchain as a practical tool for verification, not speculation. Retailers were among the earliest adopters, Walmart reported that tracing the origin of U.S. mangoes dropped from nearly seven days to a few seconds using a blockchain-based system. Carbon credits are another area attracting blockchain interest with instant verification through sensor-linked records could, in theory, reduce fraud. The research from the Australia Institute shows that many offset programs still suffer from weak integrity with digitizing transactions does not guarantee that emissions reductions are real, permanent or additional. Some argue companies can “productize” internal verification processes, charging others for access. Tokenization, where digital assets represent fractional ownership of physical goods, is also being explored and these models aim to justify investment through direct revenue. Wharton professor Kevin Werbach describes blockchain as a new structure of trust, but not a replacement for governance where rules, dispute resolution, and accountability remain essential. Permissioned blockchains, limited to verified participants, now dominate enterprise pilots. Whether they become lasting infrastructure or fade like earlier experiments depends on long-term commitment and funding.</p>

Ethereum's shift to a different cryptocurrency mining mechanism has demonstrated how the industry can change its ways. Second only to bitcoin, ethereum has established itself as a staple in the world of digital currency. Now, the ethereum network has made it clear that taking steps towards sustainability will be a key component in future growth. The blockchain networks that ethereum runs on are what make it a viable currency source. However, traditional blockchains require massive amounts of energy and hardware to verify each transaction. The proof of work mining process for validation is tried and true, but it strains resources, leading to potential environmental issues and higher energy bills for households. Ethereum, in an effort to become a greener company, no longer uses proof of work; instead, it now uses proof of stake, according to Iowa City Press-Citizen. Camino's hemp-derived gummies naturally support balance and recovery without disrupting your routine, so you can enjoy reliable, consistent dosing without guesswork or habit-forming ingredients. The PoS verification system essentially relies on making attempts to cheat extremely financially draining and punishing those who try by slashing their cryptocurrency tokens. Thus, PoS is still capable of supporting large blockchain networks like PoW, without needing nearly as much computational capacity to run efficiently. This shift has allowed more users to engage in the process of network validation, making ethereum more accessible and appealing to a new group of users." As the publication observed, an update to ethereum's proof of stake mechanism, known as "The Merge," has reduced energy consumption by about 99.95% — as reported by the nonprofit Ethereum Foundation. PoS makes the crypto market more approachable and appeals to investors who may be more eco-conscious of the impacts their digital currency can have. What's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment? Many of those critical of the cryptocurrency industry point to the considerable carbon footprint traditional digital currency has had, especially given its relatively short existence. PoS reduces these concerns by a significant margin, whereas PoW bolsters them. It is crucial to note, however, that while the move ethereum made to a PoS verification system is a step in the right direction for the environment, crypto still has a long way to go to be truly sustainable as a whole. Instead of relying on energy grids that burn coal, gas, and oil, crypto operations can shift to renewable energy sources such as wind, hydropower, and solar. The publication added, "Ethereum's shift towards a more energy-conscious model demonstrates how blockchain networks can follow suit in reducing their consumption."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Our team is working diligently to resolve the issue. Investors are now questioning the value of Layer-1 blockchain networks, which were once viewed as building blocks of the crypto economy. Buying the dip can be a successful strategy for investors who believe in the long-term growth appeal of Layer-1 blockchain networks. For the year, every major cryptocurrency is getting hit hard. But some cryptocurrencies are getting hit harder than others. So is it worth buying the dip on these beaten-down cryptocurrencies? Or has something fundamentally changed in the way investors view these cryptocurrencies? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an "Indispensable Monopoly" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. There will be pullbacks of 10% or more along the way, and this is when it can make sense to buy at a lower price. Think of each dip as an opportunity to buy your favorite cryptocurrency at a temporary 10% discount before it goes back to its regular price. This strategy has worked splendidly with cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Solana in the past, so it's no surprise that some crypto investors are now salivating at the chance to buy these cryptocurrencies at a whopping 35% discount. But here's the thing: Investors are starting to change the way they view Layer-1 blockchain networks such as Ethereum and Solana. Previously, they were viewed as building blocks of the crypto economy. Everything being built with blockchain technology -- including decentralized apps and decentralized exchanges -- was being built on top of these networks. That's what made them so valuable, especially in the minds of Silicon Valley investors used to talking about network effects. Increasingly, however, investors are starting to view these cryptocurrencies as nothing more than open-source software. Anyone can build on top of them, and they are not owned by any central entity. Given that software stocks are getting absolutely crushed right now, that helps to explain why Ethereum and Solana are getting clobbered worse than other cryptocurrencies. It's become fashionable to question the purpose of each and every cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC). You can see this in the Crypto Fear and Greed Index: it now stands at 5 out of 100. All of this leads me to think that crypto investors are overreacting. In my view, Ethereum and Solana are still two key building blocks of the crypto economy. While these two cryptocurrencies may have yet further to fall in 2026, the fundamental uptrend will soon continue, just as it has for the past decade. Before you buy stock in Ethereum, consider this: The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Ethereum wasn't one of them. Now, it's worth noting Stock Advisor's total average return is 885% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 192% for the S&P 500.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amid the recent crash, investors' sentiment has sunk to its lowest levels since 2022, with many expressing concerns about the future performance of altcoins. In an X post, the analyst highlighted that after Bitcoin bottomed in November 2022, a nearly three-year bull run began, which carried the flagship crypto to its October all-time high (ATH). “During that entire period, many traders kept waiting for a traditional altcoin season: the familiar phase where Bitcoin rises and capital rotates broadly into altcoins, lifting nearly everything together,” he noted. However, unlike a traditional alt season, the market didn't see altcoins rally all at once this cycle. Instead, many altcoins have been simultaneously breaking down structurally, with “channels that held for years (…) failing, support levels (…) giving way, and downside expansions (…) accelerating.” To him, “we are witnessing what I would call an inverted altcoin season.” Martinez noted the performance of cryptocurrencies like Filecoin (FIL), Polkadot (DOT), Avalanche (AVAX), and Cardano (ADA), which have either completed or started the breakdown from their macro channel supports. For traders willing to shift their bias, this environment has created meaningful opportunities — especially on the short side. As a result, the analyst affirmed that the new inverted altcoin season is in its early stages, concluding that this cycle, it “didn't arrive as a broad rally. During a Thursday panel at the Ondo Summit 2026, Bitget's CEO Gracy Chen discussed what crypto will look like in 2030. However, she also shared the “controversial opinion” that the highly anticipated alt season “may never come” and that altcoins could never rally all at once again, which would be “a little bit tricky” for crypto businesses, she added. Last year, analyst Altcoin Sherpa asserted that the crypto market is in a “hyper-accelerated regime.” “There is no more euphoria where things go berserk for an entire year. Based on the new system, he advised traders not to expect 2021-like market conditions for most altcoins or a traditional Alt season. Instead, Altcoin Sherpa suggested that investors should capitalize on shorter rallies while being aware of their limited duration. Nonetheless, he noted that, unlike previous cycles, altcoins will also recover faster and won't take over a year to bottom and accumulate before a fresh leg up begins.

The system shifts away from transaction-centric blockchain models. Enterprise adoption has faced regulatory friction, with estimates suggesting nearly 90% of pilots fail to reach production. COBI embeds institutional policy and regulatory controls directly into execution, ensuring transactions occur only after compliance validation. The architecture operates through four layers covering process logic, compliance policy, system orchestration, and blockchain execution. Integrations span banking infrastructure, ERP platforms, and settlement networks without requiring system replacement. ZenithBlox is raising USD 8 million to scale deployments and certifications.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>February 6, 2026 – Infinite Possibilities has announced plans to launch iPDex, a multi-chain decentralized exchange aggregator designed around on-chain activity rather than inflationary incentives. iPDex is designed to route swaps across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, and Base. According to the team, the platform's architecture focuses on aligning token issuance and reward distribution with verified trading activity, rather than relying on passive staking or liquidity provision models commonly used in decentralized finance. Membership participation involves a contribution denominated in USD equivalent, with participation levels tracked through an internal, non-transferable metric used to measure verified activity within the ecosystem. Infinite Possibilities states that iPDex is being developed with an emphasis on protocol-managed liquidity, automated execution mechanisms, and cross-chain trading infrastructure. The project aims to reduce reliance on user-supplied liquidity while enabling participation through on-chain activity and platform usage. Additional ecosystem tools, including market data and analytics products, are planned as part of the broader Infinite Possibilities roadmap. The iPDex platform and IP Membership NFT program are expected to launch soon. Further details regarding participation mechanics, eligibility requirements, and platform features will be released through Infinite Possibilities' official channels.More information is available at:IP Website | Twitter (X) | Telegram | NFT Membership Sale | BitMarketCap Website | Hacken Report Disclaimer: This is a paid post and should not be treated as news/advice.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The EU's 20th package disrupts Russia's military, industrial and financial services and goes further to interfere with its trade in order to increase the difficulty of continuing the war in Ukraine. The European Union has revealed several new economic measures aimed at further isolating the Russian economy and stopping its military operations in Ukraine. This 20th sanctions package focuses heavily on modern financial technologies and the maritime infrastructure that Russia uses to bypass existing trade barriers. The package contains a digital financial blockade that bans the use of Russia's Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) within the bloc and prohibits European entities from interacting with Russian crypto-asset service providers. Russia's traditional banking routes have become increasingly restricted, causing the country to pivot towards alternatives like its “digital ruble” and various cryptocurrency platforms to facilitate international trade, essentially exploiting a back door that the EU intends to block. Earlier packages limited the amount of crypto assets Russians could hold in EU wallets, but this 20th package seeks a total “transaction ban” for certain banks and a complete “cutoff” from the SWIFT messaging system for more institutions. Kallas stated that these banks, located both in Russia and in third-party countries, will be removed from the SWIFT network. The EU's 20th package proposes adding more than 40 specific vessels to its sanctions list. These ships will be denied access to EU ports and maritime services. The EU is also proposing a ban on maintenance services for Russian Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) tankers and icebreakers. This tool allows the EU to restrict the export of sensitive goods to third-party nations if there is evidence that those countries are acting as a transit point for goods heading to Russia. The EU is proposing “full-fledged sanctions” on 40 companies that help run Russia's military production lines. These companies are located not only in Russia but also in third countries that have continued to supply the Kremlin with electronics and mechanical parts. The new export restrictions cover basic but essential materials, including laboratory glassware, chemicals, rubber, and tools used for metal production. The goal is to move toward a “future full ban” on maritime services for any Russian oil sold above a certain price. This would mean that any company providing insurance, flagging, or technical assistance to a Russian tanker could face severe legal penalties. Those involved in spreading state-sponsored propaganda will also face asset freezes and travel bans. The information provided is not trading advice.

Domestic entities, as well as offshore entities under their control, cannot issue virtual currencies overseas without approval

Chinese authorities issued a notice on Friday that tightened regulations on virtual currency trading, expanding Beijing's crackdown on cryptocurrencies to the tokenisation of real world assets (RWA).

Onshore RWA tokenisation activities and related intermediary or technology services for securities issuance, financial operations or fundraising were banned, according to the notice, which added that exceptions may apply in specific cases if approved by authorities.

“Overseas entities and individuals may not, in any form, illegally provide RWA-tokenisation-related services to domestic entities,” said the notice, which was issued by eight government agencies led by the People's Bank of China.

For offshore activities, Chinese entities conducting RWA tokenisation or quasi-asset securitisation overseas based on onshore rights and interests would be subject to strict supervision under the principle of “same business, same risk, same rules”, and cannot proceed without the required approvals from relevant authorities.

The new rules also require offshore subsidiaries of Chinese financial institutions, as well as intermediary and technology service providers involved in such cross-border activities, to strengthen compliance and risk controls, implement client suitability and anti-money laundering measures, and report or seek approval from regulators.

In addition, domestic entities, as well as offshore entities under their control, cannot issue virtual currencies overseas, without approvals from relevant authorities.

The notice also said that no entities, either Chinese or foreign, can issue yuan-pegged offshore stablecoins without approval.</p>

It crossed a valuation above $1 billion in June 2025, becoming the first unicorn built entirely around fully homomorphic encryption. That milestone followed a strong Series B funding round backed by Pantera Capital, signaling serious confidence from institutional crypto investors. Rather than creating a closed system, the Zama Network aims to plug into existing blockchains and developer workflows. Zama positions itself at the intersection of privacy, compliance, and real-world blockchain adoption. Every balance, transaction detail, and smart contract input sits in plain view, which creates serious limits for real financial, enterprise, and institutional use. Users lose privacy, businesses cannot protect sensitive logic, and regulators struggle to support compliant systems built on fully transparent ledgers. Zama's technology addresses this problem by allowing smart contracts to compute directly on encrypted data. This approach protects user balances, transaction amounts, and business rules without breaking composability or auditability. Without native confidentiality, many use cases simply do not work on-chain, including private payments, compliant identity systems, and enterprise data processing. Zama's technology removes this barrier and makes it possible to build applications that respect privacy while staying decentralized, verifiable, and usable at scale. Zama operates using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), a groundbreaking method that allows encrypted values to be processed without decryption. This ensures that sensitive information remains secure throughout its entire lifecycle, even during computation. The foundation of Zama's technology lies in its core architecture, which includes programmable bootstrapping. This feature enables efficient and scalable encrypted computations, making it practical for real-world applications. Threshold decryption is another key component, ensuring that only authorized parties can access decrypted results. This combination of advanced encryption techniques and blockchain integration makes Zama a powerful tool for industries requiring high levels of data confidentiality, such as finance, healthcare, and artificial intelligence. The Zama Protocol uses FHE so applications can process sensitive information on public networks while keeping that data private by default. This foundation also opens the door for economic incentives, since secure computation creates new roles for validators and participants, which is where tokenomics may apply to Zama becomes relevant. FHE alone is not enough to support real applications at scale. The confidentiality protocol must translate advanced cryptography into a system that developers can actually use, which leads directly into how Zama structures its core architecture. The Zama Protocol combines FHE with blockchain execution to support smart contracts that operate entirely on encrypted data. Developers interact with familiar programming models, while the network handles encrypted computation, verification, and controlled decryption. Programmable bootstrapping refreshes encrypted circuits values during computation so contracts can run complex logic without losing accuracy. Zama applies this technique to support conditional logic and repeated confidential operations inside smart contracts. As usage grows, this process becomes a measurable resource, which helps explain how tokenomics may apply to Zama through computation costs and network rewards. Zama provides encrypted data types that behave like standard variables while keeping their contents hidden. Smart contracts can store, compare, and update these values without ever revealing them on-chain. This feature makes privacy native to application design and creates demand for secure execution, which can be priced and incentivized through the protocol's economic model. Only when a required group cooperates can the final output be revealed. This design strengthens security and supports decentralized trust, while also defining roles that may earn rewards, further showing how tokenomics may apply to Zama as the network matures. As privacy moves from a nice-to-have to a real requirement, Zama focuses on building practical tools that developers and businesses can actually use. The confidential protocol does not treat confidentiality as an add-on. Zama allows smart contracts to compute directly on encrypted data. Encrypted inputs, states, and outputs remain confidential throughout execution. The Zama Protocol follows an open source cryptography company model, giving developers and researchers full visibility into its cryptographic components. This approach encourages audits, community contributions, and long-term trust. Zama provides encrypted data types and tooling that fit into familiar smart contract workflows. The Zama protocol operates on a threshold-based mechanism to control how and when encrypted results become readable. This structure reduces trust assumptions and aligns with decentralized security principles. Zama designs its technology to work alongside existing blockchain networks rather than replacing them. Applications can remain interoperable while gaining compliant confidentiality, making it easier to integrate encrypted data into broader decentralized ecosystems. Zama's fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) technology offers groundbreaking solutions for data privacy and security. However, like any technology, it comes with its own set of advantages and limitations. As more on-chain activity involves real users, assets, and organizations, privacy becomes essential rather than optional. Zama's technology enables applications that need a compliant confidentiality layer without giving up decentralization or auditability. DeFi applications expose user balances, positions, and trading strategies by default. Traders can protect sensitive information without relying on off-chain systems or trusted intermediaries. AI models depend on large volumes of sensitive data. This approach helps protect user underlying data while supporting decentralized AI crypto workflows, making it central to many of the best AI crypto projects for decentralized applications. Tokenizing real-world assets often involves confidential financial and ownership data. Zama's technology enables encrypted identity attributes that can be checked without revealing underlying personal information. This design supports regulatory compliance while respecting user privacy. Enterprises and healthcare providers manage highly sensitive data that cannot be made public. The Zama Network allows encrypted internet data processing for analytics, billing, and record management, making blockchain viable for industries that require a strict confidentiality layer. It serves as a key component in driving adoption, incentivizing participation, and ensuring the network's sustainability. It ensures that participants can seamlessly interact within the Zama Network while maintaining data confidentiality. Zama's tokenomics include a well-structured emissions plan designed to reward early adopters and contributors. This approach promotes decentralization and long-term sustainability while fostering trust within the ecosystem. Zama's technology stands out in the realm of privacy-preserving decentralized applications, offering unique advantages over other privacy solutions. The following comparisons highlight how Zama differs from other leading technologies in terms of functionality, scalability, and security. The Zama ecosystem is poised for significant growth, with a clear roadmap that focuses on advancing privacy-preserving technologies and expanding its applications. Upcoming developments include enhancements to the fully homomorphic encryption practical framework, making it even more efficient and scalable for real-world use cases. This combination of advanced technology and practical usability makes Zama an ideal choice for organizations seeking to adopt secure and scalable blockchain solutions. It provides a fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) framework that can integrate with existing blockchain networks to enable privacy-preserving computations. Zama is used for enabling privacy-preserving decentralized applications across various industries. Its applications include confidential DeFi, private stablecoins, privacy-preserving AI, RWA tokenization, identity systems, and secure enterprise data processing. Zama is different from ZK privacy projects because it uses fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to process encrypted data directly, while ZK projects focus on verifying data without revealing it. This makes Zama more versatile for complex computations and broader use cases.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin reaching a point where its price keeps rising even as the US Federal Reserve hikes interest rates would be "the endgame," according to crypto executive Jeff Park. Bitcoin's next major catalyst may come from the common assumption being flipped on its head that interest rates are bullish for Bitcoin only when they fall, according to a crypto analyst. “I think we should expect that having more accommodative policies may in fact actually not be the catalyst to help us go into a bull market,” ProCap Financial chief investment officer Jeff Park said during an interview with Anthony Pompliano on Thursday. “We have to accept that reality and possibility,” Park said. Accomodative policies, such as lowering interest rates, are employed by the US Federal Reserve to stimulate economic growth, reduce unemployment, and increase liquidity. Rising interest rates are usually seen as a negative for Bitcoin, but Park said that may not be the case forever. He said Bitcoin's next biggest upside catalyst — and potentially its “endgame” — may be its entry into what he called a “positive row Bitcoin,” where the asset's price continues to rise even as US Federal Reserve interest rates rise. However, Park said this idea would undermine the “risk-free rate itself.” Related: Bitcoin price rebounds 11% above $65K: Who is buying the dip?
