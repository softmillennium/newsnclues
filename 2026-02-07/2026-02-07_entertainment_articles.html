                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the band celebrates 50 years of hair metal greatness, Twisted Sister‘s future is up in the air. On Friday, the band announced that lead vocalist was resigning due to “a series of health challenges,” and as a result, their Twisted Forever, Forever Twisted 50th anniversary tour has been canceled. “With regrets, Twisted Sister cancels 50th anniversary celebration performances,” the statement from guitarist/manager Jay Jay French and guitarist Eddie ‘Fingers' Ojeda reads. “Due to the sudden and unexpected resignation of Twisted Sister's lead singer Dee Snider brought on by a series of health challenges, the band has been forced to cancel all shows scheduled, beginning April 25th in Sao Paulo Brazil and continuing through the summer. Stay tuned for updates,” the band added. In September, when the tour was first announced, Snider raved about reuniting with fellow bandmates French, Ojeda, Rusell Pzütto and Joe Franco. “If you're lucky enough to be in a band that people still want to see after fifty years, how can you not answer the call?” he said. “In 2026, TWISTED Fucking SISTER will hit stages around the world because WE STILL WANNA ROCK!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A tow truck was called to Guthrie's residence, located in the Catalina Foothills north of Tucson, on Friday and removed a Blue Subaru SUV — which is believed to be owned by Guthrie, per Fox News. Authorities did not share why the vehicle was taken. Footage captured FBI agents scaling the roof of Guthrie's home before grabbing what is believed to be a camera. “Apparently on that roof, the agents recovered a new camera, a camera that apparently they hadn't been aware of and they took it into their custody. I don't know anymore than that as to why it hadn't been recovered, what it might see,” Mauro told Fox News' Jesse Watters on Friday. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. The Pima County Sheriff's Department did not immediately respond to Page Six's request for comment. A Circle K spokesperson alleged on Friday that law officials reached out to one of their stores on Oracle Road in Tucson after “receiving a tip regarding a vehicle of interest, and our team has provided them access to the store's surveillance video.” Nancy, who is the 84-year-old mother of Savannah Guthrie, was reported missing on Sunday, Feb. 1, after she missed church service. She was last seen on Jan. 31 around 9:45 p.m. after having dinner with some family members. On Monday, police declared Nancy's home was being treated as a crime scene. Since her disappearance, several ransom notes have been reported. On Tuesday, TMZ reported that the outlet received an alleged note demanding millions of dollars in Bitcoin be paid in exchange for Nancy's release. After the first deadline passed, Savannah's brother, Camron, issued a statement begging Nancy's purported captor to send proof that she's alive.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New details emerge as the search for Nancy Guthrie continues. On Friday, a car was towed away from Nancy's house, just hours after authorities returned to the residence as part of continued investigative efforts. In a video shared by Fox News, the vehicle, which looked like an SUV, can be seen being loaded on the back of a flatbed truck. It was accompanied by a police escort and taken to a lot near the Pima County Sheriff's Department, the outlet observed. One of them was seen taking something that looked like a camera. It is worth noting that the first ransom note sent to a handful of media outlets mentioned a floodlight at Nancy's home and an Apple watch. The FBI and local authorities are now investigating a “new message” connected to the disappearance of “Today” host Savannah Guthrie's mother, Nancy. On Friday afternoon, Arizona-based CNN affiliate KOLD 13 reportedly received a new ransom letter and forwarded it to law enforcement. A spokesperson for Circke K told the outlet that authorities visited one of their stores on Oracle Road in Tucson after “receiving a tip regarding a vehicle of interest.” They reportedly provided investigators access to the store's surveillance video. As of this writing, no suspect has been identified by authorities. “We respectfully ask that these messages be shared on social media and not through the PCSD non-emergency phone line,” Nanos said in a statement. “Calls expressing condolences have overwhelmed our communications staff, and it's critical that the line remain available for law enforcement purposes.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brooklyn Beckham and wife Nicola Peltz are reportedly planning to adopt a child as their feud with his parents, David and Victoria Beckham, deepens. “This is a subject Nicola and Brooklyn firmly align on,” the insider added. “They both want a brood of children, and for at least one to be adopted.” “They both know they come from a place of unimagined privilege and therefore strongly want to give back by offering a disadvantaged baby or child the best possible life,” the source explained. for her latest movie role so having a child that is biologically hers right now seems out of the question.” This new development comes weeks after Brooklyn, 26, declared that he had zero interest in reconciling with his entire family — including siblings Romeo, 23, Cruz, 20, and sister Harper, 14 — in a shocking social media rampage. David and Victoria, who are “two hugely family-orientated people” and “adore the idea of becoming grandparents,” are now facing fresh heartbreak as “it would cut them deep not to have a role in a prospective grandchild's life.” By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. “The prospect of reading about an adopted baby on Instagram does not bear thinking about for them but, sadly, it is a very real prospect,” the insider added. Brooklyn has not spoken to his parents in more than eight months, and the whole family is now currently estranged from him.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In one of the latest goodbyes to an entertainment figure, “Flashdance” star Jennifer Beals fondly remembered one of her former costars, Christa Lang, around February 4, 2026 in a heartfelt Instagram post. The exact cause of death has not been specified, but the report does say Samantha cited “a brief period of declining health.” Beals began her tribute by writing, “The extraordinary Christa Lang Fuller was not only a muse to the French New Wave, partner nonpareil to Sam Fuller, loving mother to her daughter Samantha but also brilliant, mischievous and magical in equal measure.” The 62-year-old then reminisced, “She loved nothing more than to throw her artist friends into a proverbial loving pot, stir, and watch what would happen. When I first knocked at the door of her and Sam's Parisian apartment, she threw the door wide open and stark naked embraced me. With a insouciant tilt of her head she bid me follow her into the living room where Sam sat with a cigar.” A fan responded to Beals' post with their own fond memories of Lang. They wrote, “I remember the German Creme scene film “Dead Pigeon in Beethovenstrasse” from 1972. Another fan chimed in, “Such powerful and poetic words you found to describe the impactful first moment of a meeting, and the lasting effects of a friendship. Independent filmmaker Jim Jarmusch, known for “The Dead Don't Die” among other projects, also paid tribute in a post of his own. We now have lost the remarkable and indefatigable Christa Lang Fuller. I hold in my heart memories of adventures together, & with Sam. The Hollywood Reporter's obituary points out that she showed artistic talent at an early age, having a poem published in a local newspaper at 15. The report says she moved to France at 17, where she saved money for acting classes while doing modeling jobs, including as an art model for actor Jean-Paul Belmondo's artist father, Paul Belmondo.

Bad Bunny is focused less on spectacle and more on feeling as he prepares to headline the Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show. In a new interview with Access Hollywood's Scott Evans, the global superstar, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, opened up about the mindset behind his highly anticipated halftime performance, reflecting on his journey from bagging groceries to one of the biggest stages in the world. “I just want to be there,” Bad Bunny said when asked how he's feeling in the final days before the show.

Rather than focusing on hits alone, Bad Bunny said he approached the show as a storytelling exercise. “I want people to feel happiness and joy. I want to make them feel proud and think that everything is possible.” The interview also revisited where Bad Bunny was just a decade ago. In 2016, he was working at a grocery store while making beats on the side — a reality he says still shapes his perspective. I was working in a grocery store, making beats at the same time,” he said. “Broke, with a lot of dreams and goals. When the call came confirming he would headline the Super Bowl halftime show, Bad Bunny said he was at the gym — and didn't tell anyone right away. Fresh off the 2026 Grammy Awards, where he added three more trophies to his career total, Bad Bunny also shared a moment with Lady Gaga that stuck with him. As for what he hopes audiences take away once his time on stage ends, Bad Bunny kept it simple. He added: “I'm just a normal guy that makes music.” Bad Bunny will headline the Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show on Sunday, Feb. 8, during Super Bowl LX, airing on NBC and Peacock.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inspired by the 1989 film starring Tom Hanks, the series centers on a new mom who begins to suspect something sinister is afoot in her idyllic neighborhood. Where Tom Hanks' Ray was an established local casting a suspicious eye on his eccentric new neighbors, Samira (Keke Palmer) and Rob Fisher (Jack Whitehall) are the new neighbors — at least for a little while, until even fresher meat arrives in the form of Gary (Justin Kirk), a sour-faced recluse. But if its ambitions are admirable, the execution is unwieldy. A lumpy, though not unpleasant, mélange of uneven tones, thin characters and less-than-airtight reveals, The 'Burbs may not send anyone running for the hills — but it's unlikely to inspire anyone to put down stakes there, either. Best Celebrity Halloween Costumes 2025: Lady Gaga, Niecy Nash-Betts, Keke Palmer and More Airdate: Sunday, Feb. 8 (Peacock)Cast: Keke Palmer, Jack Whitehall, Julia Duffy, Paula Pell, Mark Proksch, Kapil TalwalkarCreator: Celeste Hughey The dark comedy hails from Celeste Hughey, who, as a veteran of Apple TV's Palm Royale and Netflix's Dead to Me, knows from pretty towns hiding ugly secrets. Hinkley Hills (state unspecified) is a knowing cliché of white upper-middle-class bliss, right down to the literal picket fences…which should be a tipoff to anyone who's ever seen any show set in the suburbs that its oft-repeated slogan — “The safest town in America!” — probably conceals a more sinister truth. To Samira, who up until 18 months ago was a single lawyer in the big city, it's totally uncharted territory, though she's hopeful it'll turn out to be a comfortable haven while she takes maternity leave with their newborn, Miles. Hughey smartly connects Samira's obsession with Gary to her anxiety about finding her place when she's acutely aware of how much she stands out — not just as a Black woman but also for her unfamiliarity with the local culture and even her style, trendy and exuberant in a sea of drab cardigans and tasteful polos. “It's giving Get Out,” she remarks to Naveen (Kapil Talwalkar), Rob's childhood bestie and one of the few other non-white Hilltonians. It's not always clear what the series wants us to make of them, or even how deeply it intends for us to think about them — though there is, I guess, something endearingly honest about a series that seems to be working out its own ambivalence about its setting right there on the screen. The most winsome aspect of The 'Burbs (and the most persuasive case for sticking with it through a premiere, directed by Nzingha Stewart, that never quite seems able to decide how sardonic or goofy or earnest it means to be) is Palmer herself. The One of Them Days star is capable of sparking chemistry with just about anybody, and she's downright adorable trading smooches and inside jokes with Whitehall. The two are wholly believable as a couple still early enough in their commitment that they look at each other like they can't believe their luck. She's somehow even more delightful opposite RJ Cyler as Samira's brother, Langston. But the actor makes such a vivid impression with his limited screen time, and shares such a warm, comfortable rapport with Palmer, that I can only hope he'll be popping by to babysit more often should The 'Burbs get picked up for a second season. These are comedy professionals who can make the most of an affectionate zinger like Dana describing Tod as “adult Charlie Brown,” or wring laughs just from the way Tod awkwardly taps, rather than shakes, Samira's hand when they first meet. But for a long time, they're collections of quirks to be admired from a distance; they don't possess the interiority needed to make them feel knowable. It's not until the biggest puzzle piece falls into place around chapter five, finally clarifying who's trustworthy and who isn't, that the ensemble really starts to cohere and the show along with it — and even then, lapses in logic and unaddressed questions take away some of the satisfaction of getting real answers. Still, in the age of IP cash grabs that do little more than laboriously stretch out storylines that previously worked just fine at feather length, it's refreshing to see a series treat its source material as more launching board than bible, taking an old premise in totally new directions.

On Friday nights, IndieWire After Dark honors fringe cinema in the streaming age with midnight movies from any moment in film history. First, the BAIT: a weird genre pick, and why we're exploring its specific niche right now. Abandoned for free on YouTube in 2011, writer/director Fen Tian's truly rancid “Love on a Leash” has since slipped its collar to become one of the internet's most notorious “bad” movies. A rom-com so baffling, it's routinely described as one of the worst films ever made. Yes, that's a major claim — even narrowed down to other low-budget indies about magic, love, and part-time zoophilia. Related Stories ‘KPop Demon Hunters' and ‘Sinners' Among 2026 SCL Awards Winners ‘Dracula' Review: Caleb Landry Jones Has a Ball in a Gothic Saga from the Guy Who Made ‘Fifth Element' But starting with two minutes of dead air (yep, there's no audio! Over the last decade, “Love on a Leash” rose to cult status less through sincere affection than the aimless endurance it saw across niche streaming. From the popular “How Did This Get Made?” podcast to a series of bewildered Letterboxd reviews, it has been revisited endlessly by scattered audiences who broadly agree that the viewing experience itself is weird and unpleasant. And yet, this cracked meet-cute, between a struggling human woman and a toxic, cursed man-dog, is widely cited by people who admit they haven't seen it lately… or ever. Hostile to viewers and profoundly tone-deaf in its politics, “Love on a Leash” isn't just man's best friend gone bad. Part of what makes it such an uneasy sit is its sincerity. Tian's technical limitations are obvious from that radio-silent first act, but so is an eerie sense of belief in the story she's telling. Unlike “The Room,” which benefited from Tommy Wiseau's aggressive celebrity myth-making and lack of self-awareness, Tian vanished from the narrative around her film. The result is an almost reluctant cult object without a handler — possibly lovable but with a manginess that leaves you unsure whether to laugh, cringe, or get it checked for rabies. But at exactly one minute, 35 seconds into “Love on a Leash,” the opening credits voiceover (I truly did not think we would be starting this story from a canine POV and that's on me) instructs some people-petting Prince, the man turned into a dog who can still turn into a man at night, to “Lay off, man, I'm not GAY.” And I turned on this dog. I turned on this dog so fucking hard, Ali. She battles the temptations of a shape-changing devil (Prince the Dog, more like Prince OF DARKNESS) meant to draw her from Christ, and then suffers the sexy, sexy consequences inherent to a woman's nature: falling from grace into sin (and also some light bondage). It's trying to find the most playful, creative ways to explore its core concept, which is not a thing you can say about films with much larger budgets and more, um, polished storylines. But man, you gotta give me something at the beginning to not hate this fucking dog.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>

David Mamet has been trying to get a movie version of his 1988 Tony-winner Speed-The-Plow made for more than a decade at this point—even as, we can't help but notice, quite a few more current satires of the film industry have gone successfully whizzing by. Now he's finally gotten the project (apparently) together, as Deadline reports that the writer and director has wrangled Anthony Mackie, Ben Mendelsohn, Sharon Stone, and Emily Alyn Lind to star in a new film version of the play, with Mamet himself as director.

We'll be honest: It's going to be pretty odd to see how Mamet tries to update his original script—centered on two film executives (Mackie and Mendelsohn) trying to find a blockbuster hit while also engaging in a bet about whether one of them can successfully sleep with his secretary (Alyn Lind)—to reflect the nearly 40 years of cultural mutations that have gone down since. (To date this thing appropriately in your minds, just know that one of the big box office draws of the show's original Broadway run was the casting of Madonna in the secretary role.) 

Although Mamet took a 17-year-long break from directing for the screen after the failure of his 2008 film Redbelt, he returned last year with the lackluster Henry Johnson. As for his cast, Mackie, Mendelsohn, and Stone—the latter playing a “crazed movie star” not featured in the original play—are obviously well known quantities at this point, while Alyn Lind has begun making a name for herself in recent years in projects like We Were Liars and the Gossip Girl reboot.

The real question, though, is just going to be whether Speed-The-Plow has anything particularly new to say about making movies in the 2020s. Mamet wasn't exactly charting virgin territory when he portrayed the film industry as a cynical and transactional cesspool back in the late Reagan years, so finding an angle that hasn't already been covered by its many, many successors is likely to prove a daunting task.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although the recently released teaser trailer for Travis Knight's new He-Man movie Masters Of The Universe answered many questions about the long-gestating action figure film adaptation—including, to the consternation of people who manage to get themselves wrapped around the axle about parts of speech, its main character's pronouns—it failed to reveal one incredibly crucial aspect: What kind of weird, fucked-up voice was Jared Leto going to do as the film's version of ranting skeleton man Skeletor? And while we still don't know how nasal it's all going to get, a new interview with Knight centered on the character has given us a lot of exciting new phrases that we can already feel gnawing through our brains, in search of the perfect place to lay their eggs. For instance, Knight's assertion (in conversation with Empire) that “Skeletor's kind of the embodiment of toxic masculinity,” which is a wild thing to say about a guy who seems to basically be a muscle suit that's been carefully layered over some bones. Equally alarming: The news that nobody asked Leto to go out for this part, as Knight notes, “Jared approached us, because he loves Skeletor and has his own history with the character. He wanted to swing for the fences.” (“Oh me?” the tulpa of Leto who lives full-time in our minds may have remarked. “I have my own history with Skeletor.”) God bless Knight for knowing what he wants, though: The Empire piece also sees the director be asked about plans related to older version of Masters movies—because Hollywood has been trying to make this thing for 17 years at this point—that would have tried to de-goofify Skeletor by giving him a scary golden skull mask, instead of the full skeleton treatment. “Fuck that shit,” Knight declared. That's just the way it is.

But not even an extra campy Caleb Landry Jones — dressed in a vampire get-up that makes him look like albino Jar Jar Binks — can make the latest retelling of the classic gothic novel feel warranted or fresh. Released by Vertical on February 6 in the U.S., filmmaker Luc Besson‘s new take on the darkly romantic horror story is a narratively tedious and contrived tale that drains from its auteur's visually lush craft. The guy behind sci-fi favorite “The Fifth Element” once again announces himself as a connoisseur of bright colors and vaguely goofy fantasy concepts; here, through overwhelming scenes taken from a larger-than-life version of 19th-century Paris. Related Stories ‘KPop Demon Hunters' and ‘Sinners' Among 2026 SCL Awards Winners Cracked Cult Rom-Com ‘Love on a Leash' Dares to Ask: Should You Fall for a Toxic Golden Retriever? Opening 400 years earlier, Besson's “Dracula” begins with the not-yet-undead Prince Vladimir of Wallachia (Jones) going to war — after a sensuous morning spent in bed with his Princess Elisabeta (Zoë Bleu). Images of the couple making love and stuffing food into each other's mouths arrives before anything else. Still, underpinning their fiery connection with a palpable fondness, Besson's direction of “Dracula” can't drum up the soul lacking from such a weirdly stiff script When Elisabeta is murdered during a battle with the Ottoman Empire, her widowed prince vows to become a vampire and takes up the name of Dracula, promising to someday reunite with his love. It's a decent plan that Besson stretches far beyond the cold open he should've tried to instead insert obvious insecurity through dialogue that routinely repeat itself. From there, audiences are thrust back to France in 1889, where Dracula sets about the arduous task of carving out a special niche in overly tired literary adaptation history. Besson takes real liberties with Stoker's original saga too, hinting at a purposeful attempt to reframe Dracula as a sly romantic hero that winds up looking like just another ineffectual vampire movie instead. He'd fit right in on AMC's “Interview with the Vampire,” and someone should have his agent check to see if “28 Years Later” is hiring more Jimmys. As Dracula, Jones is giddy and joyous with flecks of depravity bursting through as the plot expands to include his ethereal bond with Harker's fiancée, Mina Murray (also Bleu). You earnestly believe in the love between the embattled prince and his princess, and watching Dracula seduce Mina in a super-saturated wonderland evocative of “Moulin Rouge!,” you buy that these second-generation soulmates may have seriously reincarnated their connection. But when digital gargoyles start flying down from the ceiling, the horror-action mechanics Besson can't help but include here overwhelm whatever intimacy his film had before. The filmmaker leans pop-comic rather than petrifying in his final draft, opting for earnestness that smothers atmospheric dread. That tonal choice might have worked with a more captivating ensemble, but as it stands, this vision never fully clicks into place. Notably, Christoph Waltz appears as a maddeningly nonplussed priest tasked with hunting the titular vampire. He offers intellectual conversations about God, the Devil, and moral ambiguity that tease at thematic depth. Running more than two hours, “Dracula” ultimately ignores the recognizable rhythms that make love stories and monster movies compelling — forcing audiences to stew in a historic dramedy that relies on flimsy humor to patch over too many technical problems. But not even Jones isn't funny or magnetic enough to sustain attention without the support of real suspense and allure. Immortality isn't the same thing as relevance, and for American audiences, Besson's “Dracula” is a fine excuse to go to the theaters but hardly a seductive one. With more than 200 “Dracula” films already in circulation, the genre feels ready to give both a rest.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Action film director Michael Bay is crying foul over Cadillac's upcoming F1 Super Bowl commercial, claiming in a new $1.5 million lawsuit that he was personally recruited to produce the pricey spot but later was cheated when Cadillac allegedly stole his ideas and left him on the sidelines. Then, midway through the production, after Bay and his team allegedly expended hundreds of hours “working nearly nonstop, Towriss abruptly decided to ‘go in a different direction' and use someone else to complete the project,” the lawsuit states. It claims Towriss and his Cadillac F1 team “have apparently stolen Bay's ideas and work for the commercial, without paying for them.” In his lawsuit, Bay includes an image of a written proposal allegedly used by Towriss and his ad agency to entice him to the job that said the “legendary project” called for “one of the most legendary storytellers of our generation to help bring it to life.” Bay says he was asked to complete the project on “an extreme rush basis,” by Feb. 2, 2026, so they could submit it for approval by the NFL in time for the televised championship Super Bowl LX game airing Sunday, Feb. 8. Bay says he was wary about working with the third-party agency and expressed his reservations to Towriss. In response, Towriss allegedly told him, “Well, I'm paying for this Super Bowl commercial, so Cadillac and I are in charge.” Bay says Towriss vaguely mentioned an idea about using a speech by John F. Kennedy in the commercial, and Bay pulled up a clip from Transformers 3, in which he had overlaid a JFK speech about the “race to the moon” with heart-pounding music and visuals of NASA rockets prepping for launch. Bay says he suggested gold colors, sun flares, dust, and heat ripples, citing The Right Stuff as his inspiration. Bay says he later showed clips from his prior films to the agency, including specific editing styles. After that, “Bay himself pulled a second all-nighter simply to prepare for his follow-up Webex with Towriss the following day,” the lawsuit says. Bay says his team approached the process “extremely seriously” and “understood it would cost defendants upwards of $15 million simply to pay for and broadcast this commercial once during the Super Bowl.” Jack White Slams Trump's Racist Post About the Obamas: 'Arrest This Man' Chris Brown Sued by Songwriter Claiming Star Stiffed Him Out of ‘Sensational' and ‘Monalisa' Royalties Martin Shkreli Sues RZA Amid Battle Over Single-Copy Wu-Tang Clan Album The director says he started hiring staff with the understanding he had a ballpark budget of $2 million for production costs and $1 million for post-production.
