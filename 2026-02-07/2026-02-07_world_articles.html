Donovan, Joint Task Force Southern Spear conducted a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by Designated Terrorist Organizations. President Donald Trump has claimed the US is in an “armed conflict” with drug cartels. Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle have unsuccessfully sought to pass war powers resolutions to stop the administration from attacking vessels and targets in Venezuela. Since attacking Venezuela, though, administration officials have all but admitted their goal in the South American country is to take control of its oil supply. One vessel had turned back toward Venezuela, away from the US, when it was struck. The strike on Thursday was announced soon after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth claimed that “some top cartel drug-traffickers… have decided to cease all narcotics operations INDEFINITELY due to recent (highly effective) kinetic strikes in the Caribbean.” Hegseth did not provide evidence for the claim.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and son-in-law Jared Kushner visited the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier on Saturday morning after completing talks with Iran on Friday. Kushner and Witkoff were invited to visit the carrier, which is part of the Lincoln Carrier Strike Group, by the commander of US Central Command, Adm. Brad Cooper, a senior US official told CNN. That presence has accelerated in recent weeks as Trump considered options for striking Iran, but there was no indication that any decision has been made to move ahead with options reviewed. Witkoff wrote on X after the visit that he, Kushner and Cooper “met with the brave sailors and Marines aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln, her strike group, and Carrier Air Wing 9 who are keeping us safe and upholding President Trump's message of peace through strength.” Central Command in a news release Saturday wrote that Cooper, Witkoff and Kushner met with the ship's crew, and that Cooper “expressed his gratitude for their service.” The visit came after Trump told reporters Friday that Witkoff and Kushner held “very good talks” with Iran after delegations from both countries participated in indirect discussions in Oman. But Trump added that a “big fleet” was still heading toward Iran and would be arriving soon. “Iran looks like it wants to make a deal very badly,” the president said aboard Air Force One. “We have to see what that deal is.” Witkoff and Kushner took part in the talks with Iranian Foreign Affairs Minister Abbas Araghchi. After the talks ended, in a sign that the US wants to keep up economic pressure, it rolled out new sanctions on Iranian oil and 14 vessels carrying it. Both parties have since agreed to hold follow-up discussions after consultations with their capitals, according to a source familiar with the negotiations. Trump said that another round of negotiations will be held again “early next week,” but Araghchi said no date had been set. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thousands of mourners yesterday gathered in Islamabad to start burying the 31 killed in a suicide bombing at a Shiite Muslim mosque, as residents expressed concern that there could be further attacks. A man opened fire at the Khadija Tul Kubra Imambargah compound on the outskirts of Pakistan's capital, then detonated a bomb that killed 31, as well as himself, and injured more than 170 people. Funeral prayers for some of the victims were held in an open area near the mosque under tight security, with police and a unit of elite commandos standing guard. The bomber had a history of traveling to Afghanistan, Pakistani Minister of Defense Khawaja Asif said, blaming India for sponsoring the assault, without providing evidence. “It is unfortunate that, instead of seriously addressing the problems plaguing its social fabric, Pakistan should choose to delude itself by blaming others for its home-grown ills,” New Delhi said. Civil society leaders and members of a left-wing coalition yesterday filed impeachment complaints against Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte, restarting a process sidelined by the Supreme Court last year. Both cases accuse Duterte of misusing public funds during her term as education secretary, while one revives allegations that she threatened to assassinate former ally Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. The filings come on the same day that a committee in the House of Representatives was to begin hearings into impeachment complaints against Marcos, accused of corruption tied to a spiraling scandal over bogus flood control projects. A Virginia man having an affair with the family's Brazilian au pair on Monday was found guilty of murdering his wife and another man that prosecutors say was lured to the house as a fall guy. Brendan Banfield, a former Internal Revenue Service law enforcement officer, told police he came across Joseph Ryan attacking his wife, Christine Banfield, with a knife on the morning of Feb. 24, 2023. He shot Ryan and then Juliana Magalhaes, the au pair, shot him, too, but officials argued in court that the story was too good to be true, telling jurors that Brendan Banfield set Jeremiah Kithinji had never touched a computer before he finished high school. A decade later, he is teaching robotics, and even took a team of rural Kenyans to the World Robotics Olympiad in Singapore. Guiding them is Kithinji, 27, who runs a string of robotics clubs in the area that have taken some of his pupils far beyond the rural landscapes outside.</p>

Please make this work possible with a quick donation. A series of fan-facing events in San Francisco promises to attract a majority of the Super Bowl tourists visiting the area this week, but nearby cities like San Jose are also trying to attract some of the tourists their way. “It's all about the optics,” said Todd Langton, executive director of Agape Silicon Valley, a volunteer-based organization designed to serve unhoused people throughout San Jose. The Super Bowl's sanitized optics have consistently relied on the erasure of thousands of unhoused people who set up near these high traffic areas in host cities. The Super Bowl's sanitized optics have consistently relied on the erasure of thousands of unhoused people who set up near these high traffic areas in host cities. Just last year, Louisiana ordered an emergency declaration to relocate people living on the streets near the Superdome ahead of Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans. “City council members proposed bringing a mothball fleet into San Francisco Harbor and moving all of the unhoused people there,” Aguirre told Truthout. This year, eager to avoid controversy, the region's solution to the “homeless problem” at first glance seems a bit more humane — investing heavily in temporary housing. This is especially true in San Jose, home to more than 6,000 of Santa Clara's 10,711 unhoused residents. San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan's “clean-up strategy” has been over a year in the making, with Mahan announcing a plan to build up to 1,400 new beds through the construction of temporary housing sites and interim housing communities before the end of last year. And as the cost of living swells, federal budget cuts further erode social safety nets and threaten to push more people into the grips of homelessness. In fact, the Trump administration has already cut funding from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), putting 170,000 vulnerable people at risk of homelessness. Nearly 1,000 vulnerable Santa Clara households are at risk of losing emergency housing vouchers within the next year as a result of HUD cuts. Mahan's plans to develop more temporary housing as a buffer against these federal aid cuts seems admirable, but San Jose's unhoused advocates are aware of the bitter truth that underlies these emerging policies. To build these temporary housing sites, the city utilized funds from its Measure E tax — a property transfer tax designed to fund construction of permanent, affordable housing. “The mayor convinced enough of the city council to take Measure E money — which was originally for building permanent supportive housing — to build temporary interim housing,” Aguirre told Truthout. The city's single largest revenue source for affordable housing has also been used to pay for operational costs of the city's shelters on multiple occasions. So far, an estimated $40 million that was originally intended for permanent affordable housing has instead been used to shelter unhoused residents in the short term. Aguirre added that these “tiny home villages” become sites for surveillance and further control by the state. “You're not allowed to have anybody come into your unit. “They don't want any kind of retribution, and they don't want to make trouble for the other people living in that same commune.” In fact, right after San Jose City Council made the decision to reallocate Measure E funds to short-term housing last year, the city conducted 530 encampment sweeps, including clearing Columbus Park — the largest encampment in San Jose and home to around 370 unhoused people and about 120 lived-in vehicles. Since San Jose has effectively criminalized homelessness, unsheltered people only have three chances to refuse temporary housing before facing arrest for trespassing. For Todd Langton, these accelerated abatements are the start of what he refers to as a cyclical “game of Whack-a-Mole,” especially as the city prepares for high-profile events. “In these transitional housing facilities, [unhoused people] can stay for up to six months, two years maximum,” he said. “So [the city] finds out where unhoused people are, then accelerates abatements, giving them no choice but to move someplace else, accept temporary housing, or lose everything,” Langton told Truthout. “Most of the time, they're not even offered housing. “Without enough permanent housing, there really is nowhere for them to go afterwards,” Langton told Truthout. While Santa Clara County has secured funding to develop a low-income housing project in San Jose, Aguirre says the city itself is still thwarting efforts to expand affordable housing. This new adjustment effectively raises the income threshold to qualify for housing, shifting its prioritization of extremely low- and moderate-income people toward middle-income and working professionals. With Mahan recently announcing his bid for California governor, both Aguirre and Langton insist that the city's policy of prioritizing abatements and building temporary housing has all been part of a bigger build-up — one that attempts to put San Jose in a better light. In the shadows of this misleading light, somewhere beyond the roaring fans in Levi's Stadium, are hundreds of displaced people forced to start over again and again.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Move will hit Michigan, Illinois, New York and other states with highest levels of lead drinking water pipes the hardest There is outrage among some politicians and activists after the US Congress voted to slash $125m for replacing toxic lead drinking water pipes that are particularly a threat to children. Lead pipe replacement funding was approved with bipartisan support in 2021, but Republican leadership on the interior, environment and related agencies committee that controls appropriations redirected it for wildfire prevention, over the objection of many Democrats. Many US states have called for more federal funding as millions of people in the US continue drinking dangerous lead-contaminated water. Tlaib's district in and around Detroit has among the highest levels of lead lines, “Our work to rapidly replace every lead service line in America is reaching a critical moment, and this is an insult to every one of our communities struggling for access to clean water,” said Tlaib, who is chair of the Get the Lead Out caucus in Congress. Republican interior committee leadership did not respond to requests for comment. Lead is considered among the planet's most toxic substances, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has said no level of exposure to it is safe. Removing the lines would prevent up to 900,000 infants from having low birth weight, save about 200,000 IQ points in children and avoid up to 1,500 premature deaths annually from heart disease, the EPA has estimated. Advocates say it should be an issue with broad bipartisan support that is amply funded without a fight. However, Republicans have repeatedly tried to sabotage lead line replacement efforts in recent years, in part because of pressure from an unlikely but powerful opponent – water utilities that don't want to make infrastructure upgrades. Removing the lines is a challenging task because so many remain. “You can replace a lot of lead pipes for $125m,” said Erik Olson, a senior adviser to the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund. An earlier draft of the bill proposed slashing $250m, but House Democrats, led by Tlaib and the Michigan congresswoman Debbie Dingell, who coordinated a letter to Senate leaders signed by 43 other members of Congress, were able to save half. It would take about $3bn to replace the remaining lines. The Democratic Illinois senator Tammy Duckworth said it was “obscene” for the Trump administration to cut funding for clean drinking water projects while increasing funding for ICE, which has carried out violent operations in Chicago. “We are worried about the signal this sends – that lead pipes aren't a high priority, and once you start clawing back money, it doesn't bode well for future funding,” Olson said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The documents confirm what many have long assumed: elites live by their own special rules and codes of immunity What makes these files so infuriating, however, is not just Epstein's horrific predatory behavior, which is well-known, but the more mundane examples of elite conduct that the documents continue to expose. They vividly illustrate a world whose existence many everyday people, whether fevered with visions of the Illuminati or just jaundiced by banal anti-establishment cynicism, already suspected exists: an informal global club of powerful, ultra-rich people who all seemingly know each other, help one another out, and protect each other from the consequences of their depravity. The new files will probably not provide satisfying answers to questions about, say, whether any of Epstein's famous friends participated in his sex trafficking, or if his death in custody in 2019 was truly a suicide, as authorities have said. But conspiracy theorists may still feel vindicated – and to some extent they should, Matthew Dallek, a political historian at George Washington University, said. Epstein was also a shameless wheeler-dealer who made it his mission to make the acquaintance, however tenuous, of every powerful person he could. Yet the files, especially Epstein's typo-filled email and text-message correspondences, are fascinating – and ultimately grim – in what they show of how elites act in private, among themselves. At the least, many of Epstein's powerful acquaintances remained friendly with him years after the notoriously lenient sweetheart bargain, in 2008, in which he pleaded guilty to soliciting an underage girl for prostitution, and as survivors continued to accuse Epstein of further crimes. Donald Trump's own decades-long friendship with Epstein is already well known, and seems to have ended in a falling-out sometime around 2004; the new files do not appear so far to implicate him in wrongdoing. But they do highlight Epstein's social ties with other members of the US president's coterie, including the current US secretary of commerce, Howard Lutnick. According to the files, Lutnick may have visited Epstein's private island in 2012. (Lutnick disputes this, and recently told the New York Times: “I spent zero time with him.”) Epstein, a private individual accountable to no voters, government authorities, or shareholders, was engaged in a near-constant stream of back-channel interventions in the political or business spheres: advising former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak on how to make money post-premiership; helping an Indian businessman try to get a meeting with Jared Kushner; communicating with high-ranking Kremlin officials in an effort (apparently unsuccessful) to meet Vladimir Putin; and generally conducting the sort of “diplomacy” that does not require an ambassadorial appointment or a foreign-service exam. Certain surnames favored by conspiracy theorists – Rothschild, Rockefeller, Soros – also pop up occasionally in the files, in contexts that are banal but would certainly buttress a conspiracist's belief that powerful people all know each other. Epstein may have been a convicted sex criminal and a lavishly hedonistic financier, but that did not stop the leftwing academic Noam Chomsky, beloved critic of capitalism, from joining Epstein on a private plane or trading friendly advice. It turns out that some of society's most famous populist outsiders are, in fact, very much inside. Epstein was actually a member of an elite nongovernmental organization that has been the center of countless conspiracy theories – the Trilateral Commission, founded by David Rockefeller in 1973 to promote international cooperation. Yet his induction involved no rituals of blood sacrifice: he was invited to join in the 1990s in appreciation, it appears, of some generous donations. In fact, money – plus intra-elite social trust – were usually more than enough to gain Epstein entry into whichever room he desired to be in next. Tech companies happily accepted investments from a convicted sex criminal, and investment banks gladly moved his funds around. Peter Thiel gave him advice on potentially investing in Palantir. (Thiel did not respond to a recent request from the New York Times for comment; Palantir told the newspaper that the company “was not aware of Epstein ever investing in or being a shareholder in Palantir”.) In other words, he helped rich people hide – albeit sometimes legally – their money, making them even richer, and they repaid him by making him rich as well. That itself is a rather on-the-nose encapsulation of the world that these files depict, but has not completely satisfied the many Americans who remain understandably skeptical of how a college dropout and failed math teacher from Coney Island somehow achieved the kind of wealth that is accompanied by butlers and private helipads. Not unreasonably, many of those same Americans have wondered, in message boards, social media posts and article comment sections, if his wealth was actually made by sexual blackmail of other elites. The hypothesis remains possible but ignores the simpler, and in some ways more outrageous, explanation: blackmail might not have been necessary. As detailed in a meticulous, 8,000-word New York Times investigation, Epstein was a charismatic operator who was adept at identifying and seducing useful elites and manipulating their insecurities. He thrived on the largesse of wealthy patrons, and sometimes outright stole from them. “The way that rightwing media functions today is creating conditions under which it's very hard for these folks to even comment on the Epstein files,” Matthew D Taylor, a scholar of contemporary Christian nationalism, said. This is partly for fear of antagonizing the administration, he believes, but also because of audience capture: “The audience just doesn't want bad news about Trump Republicans.” Yet the men at its center turned out not to be cunning New World Order ideologues but elite gladhanders, con artists, back-scratchers, and hedonists, in a world whose special rules they assumed, quite rationally, that they would never need to explain to the outside.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A rift between two of President Donald Trump's favorite prosecutors came to a head at the start of the year, when Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, the president's former personal lawyer, removed MAGA firebrand Ed Martin from a key post investigating the president's political enemies. One is a group that celebrates Blanche for what they consider as honoring guardrails around the rule of law. In recent weeks, disagreements over how aggressively prosecutors pursue Trump's political adversaries have become more acute — as the president has made it clear he is not happy with the Justice Department's progress in bringing criminal prosecutions against people he believed wrongly targeted him in investigations dating back to 2016. But Trump's current chief of staff, Susie Wiles, has made a point to tamp town public disagreement and drama in the second term. “It's not helping the president's agenda to have these things play out in public,” one Trump ally who knows both men told CNN. But Ed's ways ultimately don't help get what the president wants.” Blanche and Martin came to work for Trump through different paths. Martin — a former Missouri politician — won his MAGA accolades as an organizer with the “Stop the Steal” movement, a staunch defender of Trump's unfounded allegations of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election, and as an attorney for January 6, 2021, Capitol riot defendants. At the start of Trump's second administration, he was tapped to serve as the US attorney in Washington, DC, immediately getting to work implementing Trump's agenda, including demoting senior prosecutors who worked on cases related to January 6 and vowing to protect employees of the Department of Government Efficiency. “Let me be clear: this change is not temporary,” Martin wrote of demoting the prosecutors in a memo that was obtained at the time by CNN. After a 15-week tenure marked by chaotic management and social media posts that included threats against the president's critics, he failed to secure confirmation. His nomination was pulled in May 2025 and Trump then put him in two new positions at the Justice Department, including the director of the Working Weaponization Working Group and pardon attorney, which all fall under Blanche's chain-of-command. The Weaponization Working Group investigations that Martin was supposed to lead quickly stalled. He produced little to no results on investigating major Trump priorities, including what Trump alleges was widespread overreach in the Biden Justice Department's handling of the January 6 riot and into the now-defunct prosecutions of Trump and members of his staff by former special counsel Jack Smith. Still, Martin found other ways to please the president. Once inside the Justice Department's headquarters, Martin continued what he had done at the US attorney's office — pushing for prosecutions of Trump's political adversaries. Last summer, Martin posed for photos outside the Brooklyn, New York, home of Letitia James while conducting an investigation into whether she had committed mortgage fraud. The two butted heads over Martin's tactics — particularly over Martin's penchant to coordinate directly with the White House without Blanche's awareness. But it wasn't until December when Martin made a misstep major enough to prompt Blanche's effort to push him out from the Justice Department entirely. There was a report that he had mishandled secret grand jury evidence in an investigation into Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff — one of the foes high on Trump's list of targets. Justice Department review found Trump ally Ed Martin improperly leaked grand jury material in probe of president's foes Blanche's office swiftly initiated a review of the incident in December, ultimately finding that Martin had committed misconduct, two sources familiar with the review previously told CNN. In a statement to CNN Tuesday, Blanche said, “there are no misconduct investigations into Ed Martin. Ed is doing a great job as Pardon Attorney.” The division is not unprecedented — a similar divide played out during Trump's first term as president. Trump allies including Matthew Whitaker, former chief of staff to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and then Sessions' interim replacement, chafed at resistance from the president's own appointees over the handling of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. One ally of the president observed that while the Justice Department by design moves slowly, ultimately dispensing with its legal constraints has damaged the department's credibility and its ability to carry out his agenda, citing the rejection of prosecution attempts by grand juries and by judges in recent months. “The GOP keeps doing this, we do this to ourselves and we can't get sh*t done,” the person added. Last month, Trump railed at prosecutors during a White House meeting, saying he wanted more aggressive action on prosecutions of his political enemies, as well as on his longstanding complaints about the 2020 presidential election. The president has also complained directly to Attorney General Pam Bondi about those investigations lagging, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. The Department is apparently sensitive to these pressures. CNN reported on Monday the Working Weaponization Group would start meeting daily to figure out how to deliver the president's agenda. He has been actively involved in reviewing clemency applications. It is unclear where Martin will go if he leaves the Justice Department, but a source told CNN Martin spent all of last week working at the White House.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BUDAPEST, February 7. Hungary will not participate in the deployment of European troops to Ukraine, as this would mean direct military conflict with Russia, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban stated ahead of an anti-war rally planned in the western city of Szombathely. "When we talk about war, we must speak plainly. Today, the danger lies in sending Hungarian money to Ukraine. Tomorrow, young Hungarians could be sent to war. European troops in Ukraine would mean a direct conflict with Russia," he wrote on his page on social network X. "Hungary says: ‘No, we refuse to take part in this!'" Orban concluded. He intends to reaffirm this position at a meeting with activists of the ruling Fidesz party in Szombathely. The government refers to such gatherings as "anti-war rallies" and holds them ahead of the parliamentary elections scheduled in the country for April 12.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As ICE arrests increasingly look like kidnappings, Minnesotans fear the day they are taken, too Video recorded by observers tracking the agents shows what happened next. The agents, wearing tactical vests over plain clothes and with their faces covered by masks, handcuffed the man and led him to one of their vehicles. “I'm going with my husband,” she cried, falling to her knees in front of an agent. He made it across the street before slipping on a snowbank and being grabbed by two agents chasing him. “The immigration authorities are doing a very bad job right now, because they should actually be catching criminals,” Ms. Rivera said. This scene was emblematic of the thousands of immigration arrests made in Operation Metro Surge, as 3,000 federal agents have descended on the state. Officers from a wide range of agencies – Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) most prominently, but also Border Patrol, the Bureau of Prisons and others – usually with faces covered and no visible identification, trawl the streets in unmarked vehicles to conduct immigration raids and arrests that often look like kidnappings. Their tactics have included ramming and smashing up cars, racially profiling as they search for people to arrest, and pushing residents to inform on their neighbours. Agents have also clamped down on protests, frequently opening fire with pepper balls, deploying tear gas and arresting demonstrators. After federal officers fatally shot U.S. citizens Renee Macklin Good and Alex Pretti last month, the White House promised to wind down the operation. But it is pressing ahead with its plan to deport all of the country's undocumented immigrants, as well as many who entered the country with legal status. And there is no guarantee Mr. Trump won't soon target another city or state. ICE, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and their parent organization, the Department of Homeland Security, did not respond to requests for comment on this story. Clayton Kelly, a mechanic in his 20s, said he did nothing more than verbally criticize federal agents before they violently arrested him. On the morning of Saturday, Jan. 24, shortly after Mr. Pretti was shot in South Minneapolis, Mr. Kelly went to the area with his wife. “Your families are disappointed in you,” Mr. Kelly told The Globe and Mail he said to officers. Mr. Kelly had begun walking away when heard one agent say “that's him, get him.” Officers body-slammed Mr. Kelly into the window of a tattoo parlour, tackled him to the ground and put him in a headlock, he said. “I was trying to yell out that I couldn't breathe, and they were telling me to shut up,” he recalled. As he lay pinned, Mr. Kelly said, an officer put the nozzle of a can of pepper spray behind his glasses and shot it directly into his left eye. He was bundled into a vehicle and driven to the Whipple Federal Building near the airport, which agents are using as a detention centre. Many of those detained in Minneapolis end up at the Whipple complex, the nerve centre of Operation Metro Surge.Scott Olson/Getty Images; Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images At one point, an agent had Mr. Kelly confirm which phone was his. When he was released without charges that night, Mr. Kelly said officers refused to give him back the device and said they planned to go through it. Ten days before his arrest, Mr. Kelly had witnessed part of a police chase that ended with an ICE agent shooting Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, a Venezuelan migrant, in the leg. Mr. Kelly recorded the aftermath and described what he saw to a reporter. Activists across Minneapolis continue to risk arrest for following ICE vehicles, as these people were doing.Ryan Murphy/The Associated Press Brandon Sigüenza was arrested while observing federal agents in South Minneapolis on Sunday, Jan. 11. That day, Mr. Sigüenza and a friend, Patty O'Keefe, were in her car tailing agents in unmarked vehicles down a residential street. At Whipple, Mr. Sigüenza, like Mr. Kelly, was in a cell designated for U.S. citizens. He saw cells holding 15 people – too many for anyone to lie down – staring at the walls and ceiling. In one of these rooms, he said, a woman wearing a hijab was crying while ICE officers outside watched through the glass and laughed. Three times that day, agents interrogated Mr. Sigüenza, the son of a Mexican immigrant father. In the final interrogation, one agent asked him for the names of protest organizers and pressed him for information on any undocumented people he knew, he said. He and Ms. O'Keefe were released without charge after eight hours in detention. East Africans in Minneapolis have been wary of racial profiling for months, hence these warning signs at the Karmel Mall and the slow business at Somali-owned shops within.Tim Evans/Reuters In court documents, ICE has openly argued in favour of racial profiling, and its use of the practice is readily apparent to non-white Minnesotans. As the agency struggles to fulfill a White House edict to deport one million people every year, officers have cast a wide net. Samrawit Yadetie, a 51-year-old Ethiopian immigrant, said she was stopped by ICE agents while shopping at Macy's in the Mall of America in early January. The officers would ask her and other hotel employees: “How did you get here? It got so bad that she quit her job. “We gave up our original citizenship to be Americans. But these days, they're trying to change America into a third-world country,” she said as she marched with tens of thousands in the streets of downtown Minneapolis last Friday. My mum calls me every four hours to check in,” he said. In many immigrant families, parents aren't going to work and children are staying home from school to avoid getting grabbed off the street. Th store offers free grocery deliveries, doing about 15 to 20 per day. One Sunday last month, they held a fundraiser at which people could purchase boxes of food for families that can't work. “It's such a difficult story, especially seeing how they are separating families now,” said Tania Sigua, 26, a clerk at the store and immigrant from Ecuador.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It knocks on doors and learns how to flush tear gas from eyes. It takes knowledge from deep inside the apparatus of border enforcement and delivers it to people preparing to defy that apparatus. The city of Denver said it had received more migrants per capita than any other U.S. urban area. Hotels filled and Donald Trump took notice, accusing the city of harbouring Venezuelan gangs. Stand against the dictates of federal law enforcement and “we're going to come after you,” Attorney-General Pam Bondi said last year, a warning that became tangible when thousands of federal agents deployed to Minnesota. It has, instead, provoked defiance, an effort that has swept up retirees alongside school workers and legislators – and, in Denver, a group of bar workers determined to be ready. “The average person doesn't understand how much influence and power we have,” said Tiffany Hernandez, who has become an unlikely foot soldier in one campaign to prepare for a future immigration-enforcement surge to Denver. Born in California to Mexican immigrants, Ms. Hernandez – who calls herself a “tiny Latina” – is a bartender who thrills to the creation of cocktails, shaking together martinis from vinegar shrubs and cilantro oils. But over the past year, she has become a self-created lieutenant in a city of people marshalling whatever resources they can find to prepare. Ms. Hernandez has co-ordinated with lawyers, a local rapid-response hotline, employers and left-leaning politicians to organize training events. The have received backing from liquor makers, including Mexican tequila brands that have supported efforts in the U.S. to prepare for immigration enforcement. Immigrants make up roughly 40 per cent of hospitality workers in the U.S. Large numbers are undocumented. Five-year-old boy, father return to Minnesota after detention in Texas ICE facility But at a fraught moment, Ms. Hernandez's effort to train Denver bartenders has quickly drawn in support from unexpected places as this city – like others across the U.S. – organizes itself to resist the power of a federal government determined to deport those in the country illegally. Among them is a lawyer who previously worked with Border Patrol, the agency whose personnel have been involved in a series of violent confrontations, including the shooting death of Minneapolis nurse Alex Pretti. An anti-ICE poster sits in the Denver Alliance for Street Health Response (DASHR) office.Michael Ciaglo/The Globe and Mail It is important, the lawyer said, to distinguish Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, agents from those with Border Patrol, who receive only a few months of training and have been accustomed to working in remote areas with little oversight. “‘Understanding the enemy,' is how we talk about it.” In America's first sanctuary city, anti-ICE sentiment is revitalizing the movement After Mr. Pretti was shot dead, the numbers swelled to 430. Some 1,400 people have now filled out a form expressing interest in training, said Kellyn McClanahan, one of the group's founders. “People's reaction, instead of standing back or laying down before the intimidation, has instead been to rise up and try to support each other,” she said. Anxiety over what the future might bring has galvanized people of all ages and experiences. Former federal employees with USAID – the international aid organization shut down by the Trump administration – have helped to translate training documents into Croatian, Serbian and Nepali, languages spoken by some immigrants in Colorado. “We emphasize that ICE is running around mostly with administrative warrants, if anything,” said Joel. The Globe is not using their full names because they fear reprisal for their efforts as part of a group that has visited 1,500 Colorado businesses in the past few months alone. Like many others, they have also begun to build lives on Signal, the encrypted messaging app that has become a favoured tool for organization and rapid dissemination of information. In Denver, community group chats have been arranged in layers of communication: one for each quadrant of the city and then, below that, groups for individual neighbourhoods. San Diego braces for more ICE agents as residents protest and patrol the streets It is awareness, preparation – and community,” said Milo Schwab, a civil-rights attorney who has worked closely with Escuelitas. Ms. Hernandez holds to the idea that knowledge confers power, or at least that it will at some date in the future. “The best thing that we can do right now is get as much evidence as possible to when we inevitably have our own Nuremberg trials – to make sure that these people are held accountable,” she said. For those who have educated themselves, it has brought something else, too. At a time when blood has been shed in street confrontations, “getting to listen to lawyers and people on the ground doing actual work, felt very calming,” said Lizz Shrewsbury, a worker at a Denver speakeasy bar. The past few weeks have brought greater numbers of people into resistance movements. She doesn't see numbers so great that they might cause those enforcing immigration law to back down. “If we don't change Congress, I think the country's toast,” Joel said. DASHR executive director Vinnie Cervantes in front of the Colorado State Capitol.Michael Ciaglo/The Globe and Mail His group conducts street medic training: how to care for wounds and wash eyes stinging from tear gas. Classes have become so popular that they are full for the next six months. But for Mr. Cervantes, it's no longer enough to observe federal agents and help the hurt. He wants to create networks of Denver safe houses where protesters can seek shelter. He is encouraging new tactics for demonstrators, who he says should link arms to form solid blocks of humanity in confrontations with federal agents. “The most dangerous things happen when they're able to siphon individuals off,” he said. What it comes down to, he said, is moving past simple community organization. Instead, if armed federal agents descend, “we want some level of community defence, to mobilize and interrupt this level of violence – to intervene however we can.” Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sergio Mattarella, President of Italy, gives a speech during the opening ceremony of the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics at San Siro Stadium on February 06, 2026 in Milan, Italy. Four years later, Heraskevych is preparing to represent Ukraine at the Olympic Games again — at a time when the war continues to escalate, while restrictions on athletes from Russia and Belarus are gradually being relaxed. Thirteen Russian and seven Belarusian athletes will compete in the XXV Winter Olympic Games as "neutral," meaning they will not be allowed to participate under their national flags or use national symbols. While this is the smallest Winter Olympics delegation in the history of both countries, a troubling trend is emerging: despite the ongoing war, restrictions from international sports organizations are loosening, and mentions of Ukraine are being increasingly avoided. "But from a more realistic, pragmatic perspective, this was to be expected for many reasons." When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) acted quickly, recommending that international sports federations suspend Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing entirely. At the time, it seemed the sporting world was taking a clear stand — but that position would soon begin to shift. Next year, the IOC had softened its approach, recommending that Russian and Belarusian athletes be allowed to return to individual competitions, provided they participated under a neutral flag. In 2024, that policy extended to the Paris Summer Olympics, allowing athletes from Russia and Belarus to rejoin the global stage, albeit without national symbols. Speaking to the Kyiv Independent, Andersen, founder of the Play the Game initiative, said that, unlike athletes, Russian and Belarusian sports officials were never fully suspended, allowing them to quietly influence international sports organizations. Meanwhile, oligarch Alisher Usmanov, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was re-elected president of the International Fencing Federation (FIE) in 2024 despite international sanctions, though he later resigned. Russia is also seeking allies among member states to advance its agenda within international sports federations. Ukrainian Youth and Sports Minister Matvii Bidnyi highlighted the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), which has so far maintained a ban on Russian and Belarusian participation, as an example. But one country, one vote — and it is clear they end up shouldering all the costs on these issues," Bidnyi said on national television. Most international sports federations followed the IOC's guidance in 2023, easing restrictions on Russian and Belarusian athletes. Only a few — like the International Biathlon Union (IBU) — have held firm, refusing to allow these nations back into their respective sports. But even for these organizations, maintaining a firm stance is difficult. Similarly, in October, the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF) Appeals Tribunal ruled that the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes was illegal, allowing them to compete — but too late to qualify for the 2026 Olympics. Ukrainian skeleton racer Heraskevych said that if the Russian side had pursued legal action earlier, it likely would have secured a place in Italy. He added that, while the IBSF Congress remains opposed to admitting Russian and Belarusian athletes, the federation's leadership appears "friendly" toward Moscow and Minsk. When asked why restrictions on Russian and Belarusian athletes are gradually easing, Andersen explained that the leaders who shape federation policies are not necessarily driven by geopolitics. "And the absence of Russian athletes is inconvenient for business," Andersen said. According to Andersen, many sports officials also genuinely believe in the ideals of sport — that it can unite people and promote peace. At the same time, he called these beliefs "naive" and said that they are being "oversold." In September 2025, President Volodymyr Zelensky also spoke with IOC President Kirsty Coventry, emphasizing the need to keep a clear separation between "the sports movement and Russian evil." Despite these efforts, the IOC's position remained unchanged: Russian and Belarusian athletes are set to compete in seven sports at the Olympics in Italy. Russian figure skater Petr Gumennik performed a military-themed routine in an ice show in 2024, wearing a Russian soldier's uniform. Ukrainian athletes, meanwhile, are being urged to show restraint. Because statements opposing Russia's war in Ukraine may be interpreted as political and thus violate IOC rules, Ukrainian athletes risk punishment, including suspension from competition. Heraskevych said that after Ukraine's national team protested the admission of Russian and Belarusian athletes in early January, he was approached through a third party and asked not to organize any actions related to Russia's war against Ukraine. Vadym Guttsait, president of the National Olympic Committee of Ukraine, urged athletes to "control themselves" and respond calmly to any potential provocations from the Russian side. "But you still need to control yourself so there are no provocations — because those provocations would then be used against you, against Ukraine, to claim that we are the ones provoking." When asked how Ukrainian athletes should speak about what is happening in their country, Andersen said that this responsibility should instead fall to political leaders, including the president and other high-ranking officials. At the same time, Global Athlete (GA) Director General Rob Koehler noted that sponsors of major competitions such as the Olympic Games also have the power to influence decisions made by sports organizations. "How can those sponsors justify continuing to support the IOC when they withdrew their business from Russia because of the invasion, yet still back an organization that supports Russia?" It is mind-boggling, but for some reason, they still want them back," he added, referring to the numerous doping violations involving Russian teams. "More than 500 athletes have already died in this war, and that figure is truly scary." Kateryna Hodunova is a News Editor at the Kyiv Independent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sarah Rogers, the lawyer leading US president's public diplomacy, warns that countries' shared values are under strain Thousands of miles from Westminster fuelled by gargantuan cans of energy drinks and a vim for free speech, Sarah Rogers is fast becoming a thorn in Sir Keir Starmer's side. As Donald Trump's firebrand undersecretary for public diplomacy, she relishes admonishing Britain over its unfiltered mass migration and failures to safeguard free speech. “I always make time for the Brits,” she says, as she pushes back a planned high-level meeting to show The Telegraph around. “And here,” she adds, gesturing to the bookshelf behind her, “a Christmas card from Liz Truss.” Framed sketches of polo horses, a nod to her hunter-jumper years, line one wall. On another, a vast American flag stands beneath the state department seal. Fox News murmurs from a small screen mounted above her desk. Necessary fuel, she says, to keep up the relentless pace of this administration. Viral tweets attacking European censorship regimes and criticising British officials over immigration and the handling of the grooming gangs scandal have won her a vast online following. So just how did a New York attorney become one of America's most feared diplomats? Her defining victory came in 2024, when she defended the NRA in a legal case that curbed attempts to “debank” the powerful gun-lobbying group. Mrs Rogers argued that New York State officials had quietly coerced banks and insurers into cutting ties with the organisation because of its political views. The US Supreme Court agreed unanimously in a seismic judgment that helped cement Mrs Rogers's reputation as a rising star in free-speech law. That victory led to another high-profile fight against Letitia James, the New York attorney general, who attempted to dissolve the NRA altogether over financial misconduct. She used that encounter to advocate for Second Amendment rights and ultimately save the gun lobby. “She was very quick on her feet and improvised in the courtroom. It's hard to do in these days of distraction,” one recalls. The social media influencer was convicted for using false Twitter posts that resembled Hillary Clinton adverts to spread fake information about the 2016 presidential election. “Mark of the pay cut I'm taking with this job,” she jokes. Her arrival in Washington coincides with an increasingly hawkish approach to foreign censorship laws, which the administration believes curb the right to free speech. Downing Street has faced backlash from Washington since Britain's Online Safety Act came into force last year. Under the law, social media giants face fines of up to £18m or 10 per cent of their annual revenue if they fail to remove content deemed harmful from their platforms. Like Europe's digital service tax, it is viewed as targeting American tech companies. Mrs Rogers's ability to distil complex legal arguments into viral interventions has caught the attention of senior figures, including her boss Marco Rubio. In one video, the secretary of state singled her out for making a “real splash”. Now, it's attention that matters online,” a US official with knowledge of the administration's social media strategy said. So when Mr Rubio announced sweeping visa sanctions against five high-profile Europeans accused of censoring American speech in December, it was Mrs Rogers who delivered the message. Mrs Rogers has kept a close eye on British politics, warning that the shared values of the special relationship – rule of law, free expression and democratic accountability – are under strain. The cases that alarm her most are those of Lucy Connolly and Graham Linehan. Connolly was jailed for an inflammatory social media post after the Southport attack, where three young girls were murdered in a knife attack by 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana. Linehan, the creator of sitcom Father Ted, was detained at Heathrow airport over gender-critical comments and later called to testify before US Congress. “His arrest shocked a lot of Americans,” Mrs Rogers says, before suggesting Britons prosecuted for speech offences should seek refuge in the United States. “Anyone persecuted by their government for peacefully expressing their views, including British citizens, may present themselves at a US embassy or consulate to seek information about applying for refugee protection. The United States takes free expression seriously, and this administration considers violations of that fundamental right a priority to address.” Mrs Rogers leads the way into the Truman Building's eighth-floor drawing room, where she still hopes to host her delayed swearing-in ceremony. The pace of this administration means she is yet to have it. Labour's plan to cancel local elections has raised eyebrows in Washington. Well-placed sources inside the administration say they are concerned that it is an attempt to avert democracy. “We have seen efforts in some countries to cancel or postpone elections. “We've seen all of these weapons used against President Trump, and we are therefore consistent with the values laid out in our national security strategy. Part of Mrs Rogers's remit is cultural, which means she will be focusing on America's 250th birthday in July and its forthcoming Fifa World Cup. She has had fiery meetings with French and European diplomats who have sought to push back on her criticism.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's note: This story has been updated with additional details. Russia carried out a mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure on Feb. 7, triggering emergency power outages across most regions and damaging nuclear facilities, government officials said. President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address that Russia struck "facilities crucial to the operation of Ukraine's nuclear power plants." Energy Minister Denys Shmyhal said Russian forces targeted high-voltage substations and 750-kilovolt and 330-kilovolt overhead transmission lines that form the backbone of Ukraine's electricity network. Attacks were reported across the country, including in western regions. The Khmelnytskyi, Rivne, Ternopil, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Lviv oblasts all came under fire, according to Ukrainian officials. Ukraine's Air Force said 13 Russian missiles and 21 Shahed-type attack drones targeted 19 sites across the country, with debris from the strikes falling on three additional locations. As of Feb. 7, emergency power outage schedules of up to 4.5–5 stages were in effect nationwide, with additional emergency measures imposed in eastern and northern regions, Shmyhal said. Ukraine's grid operator Ukrenergo also requested emergency electricity assistance from Poland, though no further details were provided. "Moscow must be deprived of the ability to pressure Ukraine with cold weather. This requires missiles for Patriot, NASAMS, and other (air defense) systems," he said. Since launching its full-scale invasion in 2022, Russia has systematically targeted Ukraine's power plants, substations, and transmission lines, causing repeated blackouts across the country. The latest strike comes as diplomatic efforts to end the war continue, with Moscow intensifying attacks on civilian energy infrastructure in what Ukrainian officials describe as an attempt to pressure Kyiv into accepting Russia's maximalist demands in peace talks. The controversy erupted after promotional photos appeared on social media showing models styled as schoolgirls in a classroom setting, wearing outfits widely perceived as sexualized versions of high school uniforms. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban criticized Ukraine for calling on the EU halt imports of cheap Russian energy. British defense officials told the Guardian that military options for seizing ships were discussed during consultations among NATO allies. "We will make sure that 'Oreshnik' does not even start operating," President Volodymyr Zelensky said. Some of the meetings could have been linked to Yermak's role in a corruption case involving state nuclear power monopoly Energoatom, the biggest corruption investigation during Zelensky's presidency, Ukrainska Pravda reported. The U.S. Department of State on Feb. 6 approved a potential $185 million “Foreign Military Sale” to Ukraine for spare parts and related equipment to support U.S.-supplied vehicles and weapon systems.
