                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two leaked videos recorded by the US military purportedly show UFOs operating in the Middle East. The radar footage, generated by Reaper drones flown by the Air Force more than 13 years ago, was released recently by reporters and prominent UFO researchers George Knapp and Jeremy Corbell. Three lights or orbs in a triangle formation were seen moving in over the Persian Gulf on Aug. 23, 2012, one video released on Jan. 30 showed. The objects demonstrate abrupt changes of direction and the thermographic Forward Looking Infrared Radar (FLIR) detected no heat or other signatures that mark traditional propulsion systems, according to the Knapp and Corbell report in Weaponized. George Knapp and I have obtained and are revealing for the first time military-filmed footage of multiple UAP (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena), officially documented and cataloged within Intelligence Community investigations as "orbs" in formation. Another orb-like object was recorded by a Reaper drone on the border between Syria and Jordan in 2021, the Feb. 3 report revealed. However, slowed-down video showed the object appears to break the targeted lock and disappears from sight. The releases are part of the continued push by UFO disclosure advocates to release military-grade footage of encounters with non-human crafts. Reaper drone footage of an orb being struck with a 100-pound Hellfire missile and continuing to fly was revealed by Rep. Eric Burlison (R-Mo.) The Department of War did not respond to request for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, of course, it's a huge franchise, with the It includes two theatrical films and a streaming television series, each centering on the titular ex-military investigator, Jack Reacher, known for his strategic mind and brute strength. It includes two theatrical films and a streaming television series, each centering on the titular ex-military investigator, Jack Reacher, known for his strategic mind and brute strength. One angle that hasn't been tried with the various shows following in Reacher's large footsteps is a horror one. On that note, I think the Repairman Jack series would be perfect. Introduced in author F. Paul Wilson's horror novel The Tomb, Jack is a "fixer" who lives off the grid in New York. His main gig is helping people who can't find justice through the regular channels. Jack is also a very charming and likable figure, who is completely self-taught and thinks his way out of problems. In 2007, Ryan Reynolds was being eyed to play the character in a movie adaptation of The Tomb, though the adaptation was later redubbed Repairman Jack in hopes it would lead to a franchise. Reynolds was on the verge of becoming a major star around this period, but hadn't quite found the right project. Movies like The Amityville Horror or Blade: Trinity hadn't worked, though he tended to get good reviews even when the films sucked. Building his own series with Repairman Jack sounded like a smart call. The film version spent years in development, however, and quietly died around 2011, while Reynolds moved on to hits like Safe House and Deadpool. While he might be older, I'd still love to see Reynolds try the role. He's obviously got the humor, but as Smokin' Aces or Buried showed, he can play characters with a darker edge. On one level, thriller auteur Michael Mann would be a dream director for a Repairman Jack adaptation, but he's technically already helmed a film set in that universe. 1983's The Keep was only Mann's second film, and involved an ancient evil escaping from a remote citadel when Nazis soldiers accidentally unleash it. That said, both Wilson and Mann hate the movie version, with the latter rarely addressing his cult gothic horror in recent interviews. There have been reports of a new adaptation of the book, though nothing concrete has happened yet. While a Repairman Jack TV series would be the ideal way to adapt the attention-shy mercenary, a movie could work just as well. Reynolds is said to be a fan of the character too, so if he's looking to break away from smirky action-comedy roles, Jack is the ideal character to take on.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are plenty of great Stephen King TV series out there, but the author isn't a fan of every adaptation of his work. He does, however, endorse "The Institute," the MGM+ horror series about telekinetic children whose powers are exploited by a shadowy government agency. "So you expect some changes and, sometimes, man, they're really good." King also serves as an executive producer on "The Institute," further suggesting his approval of the MGM+ series. Despite being involved in some capacity, however, the author tends to leave Cavell and Bender to their own devices, which should make the upcoming second season more intriguing. For the next installment, the creators plan to expand the lore and introduce a new story, and it appears that their idea has Stephen King's seal of approval. "We've certainly talked a lot and thought a lot about where it would go, and I have talked a bunch to Stephen about what he thinks about it and where he sees it going," Benjamin Cavell told Variety. "So if there is a demand for more, we would love to make more." The good news is that there was enough of a demand for more, as "The Institute" is one of many scripted series expected to return to screens in 2026. The exact date for the highly-anticipated Season 2 premiere has yet to be confirmed, but the production is already underway, so it's only a matter of time until it arrives on MGM+.</p>

Sir, – Am I the only one, when seeing a report that a case has been settled out of court (“Kenny Jacobs to step down as DAA CEO after High Court action settled,” February 6th), to wonder what juicy matters might have had the light shed on them?

Such matters may have merited public airing but we will never know, especially about a semi-State body. 

Call it voyeurism but I feel that I have missed the ending to an Agatha Christie novel. – Yours, etc,

She also went as far as to say it would be a very entertaining game and that there could be a major shift during the game that would work against the New England Patriots. Ahead of her prediction, I was excited for the opportunity to chat with Patti Negri at the Winchester Mystery House. In our conversation she talked about how she believes we all have certain psychic abilities that have been suppressed. This due to our overuse of logic and the modern western world. She also shared with me what it was like for her to work with the beloved crew of “Ghost Adventures”. It was a great chat you can check out below! Best known for her recurring role on the Discovery Channel's top rated series “Ghost Adventures.One of her episodes was part of the Discovery Channel's streaming service launch. Her wildly popular television and streaming series appearances have garnered over a billion views. Patti is the international best-selling author of “Old World Magick for the Modern World: Tips, Tricks, & Techniques to Balance, Empower, & Create a Life You Love.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The combustible sedimentary rock, better known as coal, was not only crucial to the onset of advanced technology here on earth, but it should also be key to the development of advanced E.T.s residing on any given exoearth. The authors argue that we needed large amounts of shallow, energy-dense coal to enable the technology necessary to first forge steel. Steel drill bits were crucial for extracting deep seated reserves of fossil fuel which provided the technology necessary to develop the kind of 20th century technology required to build radio telescopes capable of communicating over interstellar distances. Without access to coal, our own civilization would never have been able to harness deep deposits of oil and gas and in turn generate enough heat and electricity to melt steel. This enabled the development of radio telescopes that today dot our own planet which can send and receive messages across interstellar space. At first blush, this argument seems a bit far-fetched, but there are good reasons why this planetary caveat may limit the number of advanced technological civilizations (ATCs) out there that can initiate and deliver interstellar communications. That is, send radio or optical signals over vast interstellar distances. Without the massive input of energy-dense fossil fuels, it's doubtful whether human civilizations would ever have been able to acquire the technological capability to build detectable infrastructure like powerful radar, the authors note. Early coal shaft mines had depths frequently less than 100 feet, while oil wells were typically about 3,500 feet below the surface, the authors note. But because of its portability, and effectively unlimited supply, we make the case that coal (needed to make coke for steel production) was essential for pre-industrial society to transition to an advanced industrialized society, Lincoln Taiz, the paper's lead author and a professor emeritus of Plant Biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, told me via email. How can we go about detecting such coal-rich exo-societies? But the simultaneous detection of a combination of persistently high carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, heavy metals and unusual particulates like soot would be hard to generate by natural means, they note. However, the coal-burning phase of an industrial civilization would presumably be relatively brief, and any residual techno signals would quickly disappear, drastically reducing the chances of detection, they write. But in addition to the energy-dense strains of coal that were needed, earth was also fortuitous in the fact that it benefited from global plate tectonics (the dynamics of giant lithospheric plates as they move, collide and subduct atop our earth's outer mantle). In fact, plate tectonics and continental drift were crucial in producing the down-dropped basins (such as the modern-day basin and range topography of western North America) where plant growth and accumulation occurred, the authors note. Thus, any ATC will likely need large amounts of bituminous coal to jumpstart their technology. For those who wonder if the initial use of fossil fuels could be circumvented by using energy generated from nuclear, solar, wind or water, that's a scenario that's highly unlikely. That's because there's no doubt that early use of fossil fuels enabled the development of precision steel manufacturing and the sort of engineering and advanced metallurgy from which all these alternative fuel technologies evolved. This might not have happened if humans (or some other highly intelligent species) had evolved much earlier, before Carboniferous coal had progressed from peat to bituminous, they note. *The 64-meter radio telescope at Parkes Observatory as seen in 1969, when it was used to receive live televised video from Apollo 11, Credit: CSIRO via Wikipedia* We assume that an ATC would be most likely to form on an Earth-like planet, but there are an enormous number of contingent events, starting with the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis itself, that must be replicated before you get to bituminous coal, says Taiz. All this suggests that our own advanced technological civilization may be even rarer than the ‘Rare Earth Hypothesis' that Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee first proposed, says Taiz.
