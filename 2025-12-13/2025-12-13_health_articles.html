                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fibrosis, resulting from excess extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, is a feature of adipose tissue (AT) dysfunction and obesity-related insulin resistance. Emerging evidence indicates that adipogenic stem and precursor cells (ASPCs) are a crucial origin of ECM proteins and possess the potential to induce AT fibrosis. Here, we employed single-cell RNA-seq and identified a unique subset of ASPCs that closely associated with ECM function. Within this subset, we discerned a notable upregulation in the expression of Fibulin-7 (FBLN7), a secreted glycoprotein, in obese mice. Similarly, in humans, FBLN7 levels exhibited an increase in visceral fat among obese individuals and demonstrated a correlation with clinical metabolic traits. Functional studies further revealed that, in response to caloric excess, ASPCs-specific FBLN7 knockout mice display a diminished state of AT fibrosis-inflammation, along with improved systemic metabolic health. This, in turn, facilitated the conversion of latent TGF-β to its bio-active form, subsequently promoting TGFBR1/Smad signaling pathways. Furthermore, we developed an anti-FBLN7 neutralizing antibody, which could dramatically alleviate diet-induced AT fibrosis. These results suggest that FBLN7, produced by ASPCs, exerts a major influence in the development of AT fibrosis and may represent a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SereNeuro Therapeutics, a preclinical biotechnology company developing non-opioid pain therapies, unveiled new data today on a novel approach to chronic pain management and joint tissue preservation. The data highlights SN101, a first-in-class induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived therapy. SN101 utilizes mature iPSC-derived peripheral pain-sensing neurons (nociceptors) to treat chronic osteoarthritis joint pain. The data highlights a scientific approach that challenges traditional pain management logic. "Our approach utilizes high-purity, iPSC-derived nociceptors (SN101) that effectively function as a sponge for pain factors. Additionally, the cells secrete mechanistically-confirmed regenerative factors, positioning SN101 as a disease-modifying osteoarthritis drug (DMOAD). The presentation distinguishes SN101 from emerging single-target therapies, such as Nav 1.8 inhibitors. While ion channel inhibitors are designed to block a solitary pathway, SN101 cells express all canonical pain receptors and ion channels. Furthermore, the data contrasts SN101 with current standards, such as corticosteroids. "Current standard-of-care treatments, particularly corticosteroids, provide temporary relief but are known to accelerate cartilage degradation over time, ultimately worsening the disease," said Dr. Daniël Saris, a member of SereNeuro's Clinical Advisory Board and a professor of orthopedics and regenerative medicine at Mayo Clinic. In contrast to those degenerative effects, SN101 creates an environment that preserves joint tissues and relieves chronic pain, without the risk of addiction.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tanning bed users are known to have a higher risk of skin cancer, but for the first time researchers have found that young indoor tanners undergo genetic changes that can lead to more mutations in their skin cells than people twice their age. The study, which was led by UC San Francisco and Northwestern University, appears Dec. 12 in Science Advances. "We found that tanning bed users in their 30s and 40s had even more mutations than people in the general population who were in their 70s and 80s," said Bishal Tandukar, PhD, a UCSF postdoctoral scholar in Dermatology who is the co-first author of the study. Among those skin cancers is melanoma, which accounts for only about 1% of skin cancers but causes most of the deaths. Rates of melanoma have risen along with the use of tanning beds in recent years, disproportionately affecting young women, who are the main clients of the tanning industry. Numerous countries effectively ban tanning beds, and the World Health Organization classifies them as a group 1 carcinogen, the same category as tobacco smoke and asbestos, but tanning beds remain legal and popular in the U.S. In their study, the authors looked at the medical records of more than 32,000 dermatology patients including their tanning bed usage, history of sunburn, and family history of melanoma. They also obtained skin samples from 26 donors and sequenced 182 cells. The young tanning bed users had more skin mutations than people twice their age, especially in their lower backs, an area that does not get much damage from sunlight but has a great deal of exposure from tanning beds. "The skin of tanning bed users was riddled with the seeds of cancer - cells with mutations known to lead to melanoma," said senior author A. Hunter Shain, PhD, associate professor in the UCSF Department of Dermatology. "We cannot reverse a mutation once it occurs, so it is essential to limit how many mutations accumulate in the first place," said Shain, whose laboratory focuses on the biology of skin cancer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Though an estimated 60 million people around the world have atrial fibrillation, or A-fib, a type of irregular and often fast heartbeat, it's been at least 30 years since any new treatments have been developed. This is because researchers haven't had accurate models of the human heart to study. Thanks to new developments from Michigan State University scientists, that is no longer the case. In 2020, MSU researcher Aitor Aguirre and his team started creating and perfecting tiny working models of the human heart known as organoids. Now, these organoids can be modified to replicate atrial fibrillation, or A-fib. Roughly the size of a lentil, the three-dimensional heart organoids are so accurate that researchers can study heart development, diseases and drug responses in ways that were previously impossible. The organoids' rhythmic beating is so strong that it can be seen without a microscope. Led by Aguirre, associate professor of biomedical engineering and chief of the division of developmental and stem cell biology in MSU's Institute for Quantitative Health Science and Engineering, the team uses donated human stem cells, which can develop into many different types of cells and are crucial for growth and tissue repair throughout life, to develop the heart organoids. In developing human hearts, these immune cells, or macrophages, help ensure proper growth and formation. "Our new model allows us to study living human heart tissue directly, something that hasn't been possible before," O'Hern said. "When we added inflammatory molecules, the heart cells began beating irregularly. Then we introduced an anti-inflammatory drug, and the rhythm partially normalized. No new drugs have been developed for A-fib in more than 30 years. This condition remains poorly treated because current therapies tend to target symptoms rather than underlying mechanisms. Therapeutic drug development for A-fib has struggled because there are no reliable animal models that resemble the disease. "This new model can replicate a condition that is at the core of many people's medical problems," Aguirre added. In the study, O'Hern and his fellow researchers showed that long-lived, innate immune cells that reside in specific organs help guide the heart's development and rhythm. This information also helps researchers understand the origins of congenital heart disorders, the most common birth defects in humans. The researchers then took things one step further. To demonstrate how the new model can be used to test therapies for inflammation-driven heart conditions, the team introduced an anti-inflammatory drug that, based on the team's findings, was predicted to treat A-fib. "We're now seeing how the heart's own immune system contributes to both health and disease," he said. "Our new human heart organoid model is poised to end this 30-year drought without any new drugs or therapies," said Aguirre. Aguirre's team has published multiple studies, establishing Michigan State University as a global leader in human heart organoid research, and Aguirre says more advancements are coming soon. "Our longer-term vision is to develop personalized heart models derived from patient cells for precision medicine and to generate transplant-ready heart tissues one day," Aguirre said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When the unthinkable happens and a child is left critically ill or injured, the miracle workers in pediatric intensive care units around the country work tirelessly to save their lives. Yet, after discharge from the hospital, many of these children could be missing out on vital follow up care, finds a study from Michigan Medicine. "There aren't specific guidelines in terms of whether or when a child should follow up with their primary care physician or pediatrician after a stay in the PICU," said Erin Carlton, M.D., clinical associate professor in pediatric critical care at U-M Health. It was this lack of guidance that drove her and her collaborators to look more closely at what happens with this group of patients after hospitalization. Using data from both private insurance and Medicaid claims, they examined rates of follow up care within the one week of ICU discharge for patients aged 0-18. They discovered that just under 25% of patients with public insurance and just under 30% of patients with private insurance had primary care follow up within one week of PICU hospitalization. Kids who were younger and who did not have existing complex chronic conditions were more likely to receive timely follow up care from a primary care clinician. "While many of us assumed that the majority of kids would be seen by their pediatrician within a week of discharge, that doesn't seem to be the case," said Carlton. Her team has an ongoing follow up study to look at the impact of having that early follow up with subsequent outcomes, including emergency department use and hospital readmissions, she notes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers led by investigators at Mass General Brigham have published valuable information about a rare but serious complication of anti-cancer immunotherapy, providing the first large-scale description of its risk factors and clinical course, and underscoring the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment, but they can trigger autoimmune side effects. Among these immune-related adverse events, ICI-associated immune thrombocytopenia (ICI-ITP)-a condition in which platelet counts drop dangerously low-is rare and poorly understood. "We worked with colleagues at Mass General Brigham and with collaborators from six other major academic cancer centers across the U.S. to query the records of over 86,000 patients who received ICI therapy between 2016 and 2023, ultimately identifying 214 patients-or 0.25%–who developed ICI-ITP," said lead author Rebecca Karp Leaf, MD, a hematologist with the Mass General Brigham Cancer Institute. The team found that patients who developed ICI-ITP tended to have lower platelet counts at the start of ICI treatment, received therapy that included multiple ICI drug classes, had stage 4 cancer, and experienced additional immune-related adverse events. ICI-ITP occurred at a median of eight weeks after ICI initiation. Medications used to treat patients with ICI-ITP included glucocorticoids, immune globulin, and thrombopoietin receptor agonists. Recovery occurred in 161 patients (75.2%) at a median of 2.3 weeks. The investigators also found evidence that ICI-ITP and its severity were independently linked with a higher risk of death. Those with severe ICI-ITP had a nearly 3-fold higher risk of dying compared with those without ICI-ITP, underscoring the importance of prompt recognition and treatment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Adolescent and young adult nicotine vaping has become an urgent public health concern, as 2024 marked the first year that nicotine vaping was the most initiated drug. Though vaping is the most common way young people use nicotine, few treatments exist to help those trying to quit. What's more, a 2022 Drug Alcohol Dependence study reported around half of young people who vape nicotine also use cannabis, though the impact of this dual substance use on treatment outcomes remains unclear. A new clinical trial by investigators from Mass General Brigham found varenicline-a medication used to help patients quit nicotine-was effective for vaping cessation regardless of cannabis use in a study of 261 participants aged 16 to 25 years. "We need to increase use of nicotine vaping cessation treatment by young people, and we know that cannabis use is widespread in this population," said first author Jodi Gilman, PhD, Director of Neuroscience for the Center for Addiction Medicine in the Mass General Brigham Department of Psychiatry. "It's fantastic news that cannabis use doesn't appear to be a barrier to successful vaping cessation with varenicline treatment, and we can use our findings to inform screening, treatment, planning, and public health messaging moving forward." In a previously conducted randomized clinical trial, participants who regularly vaped nicotine received varenicline, placebo, or usual care for the full 12-week trial. All participants also had access to a nicotine cessation support text app. Contrary to the authors' hypothesis, cannabis use did not hinder adolescents and young adults from achieving nicotine vaping abstinence. Rather, they found that odds of being able to quit were similar across all levels of cannabis use and that varenicline was associated with higher rates of nicotine vaping abstinence than behavioral support interventions alone. Future studies could explore the effects of integrated interventions that target cannabis and nicotine co-use may yield additional benefit. Gilman JM et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A recent review published in Current Molecular Pharmacology explores the therapeutic potential of melatonin in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a complex autoimmune disease affecting multiple organs. The study, led by researchers from Iran University of Medical Sciences and UT Health San Antonio, suggests that melatonin-primarily known for regulating sleep-may also play a significant role in managing SLE and its severe complication, lupus nephritis. The review highlights that SLE patients often have lower serum melatonin levels, which may correlate with increased disease activity. "Our findings suggest that melatonin could serve as both a diagnostic marker and a therapeutic agent," said co-author Azam Hosseinzadeh. Preclinical studies show melatonin can reduce renal inflammation and oxidative stress in lupus models. Clinical trials, including a randomized double-blind study, reported decreased oxidative stress markers like malondialdehyde (MDA) in SLE patients taking melatonin supplements. However, its impact on overall disease activity remains inconclusive. Despite promising lab results, the authors caution that more robust, long-term clinical trials are needed. "Melatonin's safety profile and multifaceted effects make it a compelling candidate for adjunctive therapy, but we need to understand optimal dosing and timing," noted co-author Mohammad Sheibani.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new research paper was published in Volume 17, Issue 11 of Aging-US on November 14, 2025, titled "Methylglyoxal-induced glycation stress promotes aortic stiffening: putative mechanistic roles of oxidative stress and cellular senescence." The researchers investigated how methylglyoxal (MGO), a toxic byproduct that builds up in blood vessels with age or metabolic dysfunction like diabetes, contributes to artery stiffening. Their findings are especially important to aging and diabetes-related cardiovascular risk. Aortic stiffening, which reduces the flexibility of the body's largest artery, is a key predictor of cardiovascular disease in older adults. The research team used young and aged mice to study how MGO affects vascular health. In young mice, chronic exposure to MGO increased aortic stiffness by 21%. However, when treated with Gly-Low, a supplement containing natural compounds such as nicotinamide and alpha-lipoic acid, this stiffening was completely prevented. The research showed that MGO's damage goes beyond structural changes. It also caused the endothelial cells that line blood vessels to enter senescence, a state in which cells stop dividing and begin releasing inflammatory signals. This led to lower levels of nitric oxide, a molecule essential for blood vessel relaxation. In older mice, which naturally develop stiffer arteries, Gly-Low treatment during four months significantly reduced stiffness and lowered MGO and MGH-1 levels. This suggests that Gly-Low may help slow or even reverse vascular aging by reducing glycation stress. This is a natural detox system that helps clear harmful molecules like MGO. Overall, the findings highlight glycation stress as a modifiable contributor to vascular aging. The results suggest that natural compound-based therapies, like Gly-Low, may offer a potential strategy to protect arteries from age- and diabetes-related damage.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A pioneering study led by researchers from Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine and Naval Medical University has unveiled a novel nanomedicine, mPEG@ELA-11, which demonstrates significant potential in treating atherosclerosis (AS), a leading cause of cardiovascular diseases globally. Atherosclerosis is characterized by lipid accumulation and inflammation in arterial walls. The study found that the APELA gene, encoding ELA-11, is significantly downregulated in human carotid atherosclerotic plaques, particularly in unstable lesions. ELA-11 was shown to suppress macrophage foam cell formation, M1 polarization, and apoptosis by inhibiting the AKT-mediated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway, as confirmed through in vitro experiments. To address limitations of ELA-11, such as short half-life and poor bioavailability, researchers developed mPEG@ELA-11, a nanocarrier with optimal size (~35 nm) and pH-dependent release properties. In vivo experiments using ApoE-/- mice revealed that mPEG@ELA-11 significantly reduced atherosclerotic plaque area and necrotic core size compared to free ELA-11, attributed to its targeted release mechanism. Ex vivo fluorescence imaging showed preferential accumulation in the liver and aorta, with minimal uptake in other organs. Future research will focus on long-term safety, immunogenicity, and regulatory compliance to advance clinical translation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Insilico Medicine has developed a new class of small molecule inhibitors targeting diacylglycerol kinase alpha (DGKα) designed to restore T cell function and overcome resistance to immune checkpoint blockades in solid cancers. The paper, titled "Design, Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Novel, Potent, Selective and Orally Available DGKα Inhibitors for the Treatment of Tumors," details how Insilico combined AI-guided target validation and generative chemistry to move from a highly lipophilic reference molecule, which showed suboptimal solubility and oral pharmacokinetics, to a series of more drug-like DGKα inhibitors, culminating in Compound 10. The team analyzed multiomics datasets from patients with melanoma and clear cell renal cell carcinoma, focusing on cohorts with documented responses to checkpoint inhibition. Using a combination of disease relevance scores and disease-agnostic filters for druggability, novelty, and predicted safety, PandaOmics highlighted DGKα as one of the top immune-oncology targets associated with checkpoint resistance. Although DGKα was already a known and mechanistically compelling node, previous efforts to drug it have not yielded substantial clinical or commercial success, which only sharpened the team's resolve to apply Insilico's structure-based design and generative chemistry tools to overcome these challenges to create a new generation of DGKα inhibitors. DGKα is a lipid kinase that converts diacylglycerol (DAG) into phosphatidic acid (PA), shifting DAG-dependent signaling such as Ras/ERK and PKC pathways that drive tumor cell proliferation and survival, and dampening T cell receptor signaling in the tumor microenvironment to promote immune evasion. In T cells, DGKα acts as a brake on T cell receptor signaling, promoting an anergic, low-function state that is increasingly recognized as a key contributor to primary and acquired resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Inhibiting DGKα can shift this balance back toward effective antitumor immunity by both reactivating intratumoral T cells and disrupting pro-survival signaling in tumor cells, offering a dual-mechanism strategy to reverse immune anergy and deepen responses to checkpoint blockades. First-generation inhibitors achieved nanomolar potency but failed to translate due to poor selectivity, off-target kinase activity, short half-lives and low oral bioavailability. More recently developed DGKα inhibitors have advanced into early clinical testing in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, but patent data indicating relatively high lipophilicity and limited disclosure of structural and pharmacokinetic data raise potential developability concerns. Together, these factors underscored the need for a new generation of DGKα inhibitors with improved selectivity, pharmacokinetics, and overall drug-likeness. Insilico's generative chemistry platform Chemistry42, together with molecular modeling, explored modifications around scaffolds that would reduce lipophilicity (cLogP) while preserving structural pieces critical to its interactions with the DGKα binding pocket. Guided by these models, the medicinal chemistry team carried out systematic structure–activity relationship (SAR) studies to reduce lipophilicity, introduce targeted hydrophilic substituents, and fine-tune the drug's hydrophobic tail, all while maintaining enzymatic potency and T cell activation. This iterative process yielded a series of DGKα inhibitors with reduced cLogP and sub-nanomolar IC₅₀ values. Among these, Compound 10, emerged as the optimal balance between potency, T cell activation, and developability. The paper further reports that Compound 10 displays improved in vivo pharmacokinetics in mice relative to the reference molecule, with less than one-eighth the clearance rate, a half-life more than 2.5-times longer, and markedly higher oral exposure. In vitro ADME profiling showed enhanced solubility in biorelevant media, acceptable cell permeability, low to moderate microsomal clearance, good plasma stability, no meaningful inhibition of major CYP isoforms, and an hERG safety margin consistent with further development. These data support its role as a potent immunomodulatory agent with the potential to boost antitumor immune responses. Given this immune-activating profile, the team evaluated orally administered Compound 10 in MC38 and CT26 syngeneic mouse tumor models in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Adding Compound 10 to anti–PD-1 and anti–CTLA4 therapy produced a clear, dose-dependent boost in antitumor activity, with tumor growth inhibition (TGI) up to 93% at doses up to 3 mg/kg, with a confirmed synergistic effect with both checkpoint inhibitors. All regimens were well tolerated with no significant body weight loss and low brain penetrance, mitigating concerns about DGKβ-related CNS effects, together supporting its potential as a backbone agent for combination immunotherapy. Harnessing state-of-the-art AI and automation technologies, Insilico has significantly improved the efficiency of preclinical drug development. Lu, H. et al.
