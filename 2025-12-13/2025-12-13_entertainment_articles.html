                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Actor Peter Greene was reportedly discovered lying “face down” on the floor with a strange note when police found him dead on Friday. “Peter was lying on the floor, facedown, facial injury, blood everywhere…” a neighbor described of the gruesome scene to New York Daily News. “I'm still a Westie,” it read, referring to the 1970s Irish-American gang that operated out of Hell's Kitchen. Greene was pronounced dead on Friday after he was found unresponsive in his Lower East Side apartment on Clinton Street around 3:25 p.m. Start your day with Page Six Daily.

The “Pulp Fiction” star's death was confirmed by his longtime manager, Gregg Edwards, who remembered the late actor as a “terrific guy” in a statement to the outlet. It appears Greene's death came as a surprise to Edwards and others around him as he was originally scheduled to film with Mickey Rourke on an independent thriller called “Mascots.” “He worked with so many amazing actors and directors,” Edwards added, citing Greene's performance as mobster Dorian Tyrell opposite Jim Carrey and Cameron Diaz in “The Mask” as “arguably his best role.” His additional credits include “Laws of Gravity,” “Clean, Shaven,” “Blue Streak” and “Training Day.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lindsay Lohan is taking over an iconic character as she guest stars on The Simpsons this weekend. The actress took to social media on Friday to tease her voice appearance as Future Maggie on the Fox animated series' Season 37 episode ‘Parahormonal Activity', which airs Sunday at 8/7c. What a dream come true to be part of this iconic family,” Lohan wrote on Instagram, also posting a clip of herself voicing a slightly older version of the perpetual baby. As some fans noted, the casting comes with a meta parallel after Elizabeth Taylor voiced Baby Maggie in the 1992 episode ‘Lisa's First Word', 20 years before Lohan portrayed Taylor in the Lifetime biopic Liz & Dick (2012). Lohan's latest voice role comes amid her onscreen comeback in recent years, most recently reprising her role as Anna Coleman in the Disney sequel Freakier Friday, now available to stream on Disney+ and Hulu. Meanwhile, The Simpsons is preparing for its milestone 800th episode in February, as Disney+ gives the show its own dedicated channel, in addition to a new movie debuting in theaters on July 23, 2027.

[This story contains major spoilers from episode four of Heated Rivalry. ] 's “All The Things She Said” likely jump after Heated Rivalry's fourth episode, fans of the series are anxiously waiting to see just where the show's protagonists Shane (Hudson Williams) and Ilya (Connor Storrie) stand. After years of casual hookups whenever the other hockey player is in town or the All Star weekend finds them together, Shane and Ilya are confronted with the reality that things just might be getting real. When the pair spend what feels more like a domesticated day at Ilya's house rather than the quick affairs they're used to, Shane bolts. David Ellison's Netflix Scare Tactic Runs Into European Reality HBO Max Teases 'Lanterns,' New Seasons of 'The Pitt' and 'Industry' in 2026 Preview The Canadian hockey player finds himself in a relationship with actress Rose Landry (Sophie Nélisse), and Shane and Ilya's not-quite-relationship becomes even more complicated. The show's big moment takes place at a Montreal night club, set to “All The Things She Said,” where the pair leave without saying a word. I'm not sure if either of you saw the reaction to the show coming, but how are you setting boundaries for yourself in this new reality? STORRIE Personally, I just limit my amount of time online. It's super enticing and super easy to fall into a trap of wanting to know what everyone's saying about you. WILLIAMS I used to tell people when it was sort of addicting and I would want to kind of scroll, that it's like people are having a conversation about you in the living room. Most people are going to be like, “What the hell are they saying?” And go around the corner. STORRIE I want to know what situation this is where someone's, like, talking about you in the living room. It's a very hypothetical situation, but then again [it's] that situation [but] they don't even know you. If you turn your phone off, it all disappears and then you're just home alone drinking a coffee, tired, bad hair, acne. STORRIE Not in the living room where they are. STORRIE The shift I think happens between them and then we see the ricochet effect of how that fragments and affects them both differently. I don't know about you [Hudson], but I didn't pre-plan a lot of stuff. I just remember doing the tuna melt scene after that. All I have to do is look at him and feed into his reality and what happens after the tuna melt scene. I just had to trust that sort of imbued in the performance. STORRIE You can't plan for it. You just have to be so prepped in your person and the story as a whole that when it's at go time for that, you're ready for it. WILLIAMS I think we had a bit of levity. [Connor] had the accent that [he] could kind of drop, and then I'm like, oh, I'm with Connor now. Shane feels like quite a departure even though it's not an accent. It feels like I can kind of leave that. It's almost like a children's game when you play dress up. It's a beat that every romance story has — things have to get bad a bit before they can get good. As the two people who are portraying these characters, why do you think that needs to happen? I don't know too many stories where there's not a push and pull. WILLIAMS It feels reminiscent of my friends who have romances, stories I hear of parents who have fallen in love. It's not just that we liked each other. STORRIE This story specifically, I think it just solidifies [Shane]. Being genuinely connected to one person like Rose, I think solidifies [Shane] contextually. Sometimes finding out what you do want is finding out what you don't want. Maybe that's why that's a plot point in a lot of these types of stories. In the book, there was always this idea that Ilya was the one who fell first. There's been a very large debate on the internet. I feel that if Ilya fell [because of] those freckles in the first meeting… It's the locker room, I think, when Shane falls. STORRIE The part that always stuck out to me [as when] Ilya really saw Shane for the first time and really liked him was actually — and the way that Jacob [Tierney] did it was so fricking good — when they're texting in the locker room. I think this is in episode one or two. [Ilya asks,] “How many times can you come in an hour?” Then Shane earnestly responds, “I don't know, twice maybe.” I think that is just plain and simple the reason why Ilya likes Shane. [It's] because that's so the opposite of Ilya. He would never be straightforward and honest. He would never be vulnerable in that almost ignorant way. I think it also comes down to a cultural difference of Eastern Europeans or cultures outside of the West. I think that's a difference of their love at the beginning. But I will say, whether it's a departure from the book or not, with all due respect to Rachel [Reid]'s book as well, I think I play Shane [as] he's sort of in love right away and then never stops being in love. He makes other choices that might not look like that, but I think they're all kind of driven through how much intense love he feels for Ilya, and I stand by that. What're you hoping people take away from the series? STORRIE I just hope that people — no matter what you think you need to be in life or what is expected of you — just be yourself. Even if that breaks some sort of boundary, even if there's not a word for it, even if there's not space for that in whatever realm you live in. WILLIAMS Fight for yourself like your best friend, and don't be ashamed of anything that exists within yourself. STORRIE Even your family [or] your friends, even if it goes against what they want and think of you — Heated Rivalry is currently streaming on HBO Max in the U.S., airing new episodes every Friday.

What began as a quiet songwriting retreat quickly escalated into something far more perilous. While spending time on a remote beach in Baja California, Jewel and Poltz were approached by armed men in uniform identifying themselves as Mexican federal police. As the boat chased a fleeing vessel that refused to identify itself, Jewel said she watched officers pursue suspects, uncovering large quantities of marijuana hidden under rocks along the shoreline. Despite the gravity of the situation, Jewel recalled moments of disbelief and dark humor, including fears that she and Poltz could be framed or imprisoned. “I was really paranoid we were gonna end up in a Tijuana prison,” she said. One of the songs born from that period would become “You Were Meant for Me,” released in 1995 on her debut album Pieces of You.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Florence Welch might be used to commanding festival stages alongside her band Florence + The Machine, but even she wasn't ready for the finely tuned machinery that is Taylor Swift's The Eras Tour. !” during Swift's final night at London's Wembley Stadium in August 2024. Jewel Says a Dangerous Drug Bust in Mexico Inspired 'You Were Meant for Me' Fat Joe Claims He Was Invited to Shoot Rockets With the Taliban Hailee Steinfeld Reveals She's Expecting First Baby With NFL Quarterback Husband Josh Allen in Sweet Home Video The moment marked a rare onstage link-up between the two artists — and, as Welch admits, came with a heavy dose of pressure. “When I got there, they were like, ‘This is your choreography.' Of course, she didn't — Welch nailed her cues, hit the emotional high note, and helped close out one of Swift's five Wembley nights without a hitch. Welch also admitted that seeing Swift as the pop deity at the center of a global phenomenon — rather than as her “cozy” friend — briefly scrambled her brain. The docuseries, which dropped its first two episodes this week on Disney+, pulls the curtain back on the tour's unseen moments — from backstage rehearsal hangouts with Ed Sheeran to personal calls with Travis Kelce that Swift likens to a “vitamin drip.” You can stream The End of an Era on Disney+ now.

Inspired by the untold story of Rodman's legendary trip to Las Vegas during the 1998 NBA Finals, 48 Hours in Vegas will take audiences through two whirlwind days in Sin City and Rodman's madcap (possibly true) adventures. “I'm genuinely excited to help create an exhilarating, joyful work that both honors and thoughtfully examines the legacy of Rodman and fellow trailblazers,” said Stanfield in a statement. “Those who moved to the beat of their own drum, undeterred by the obstacles placed before them, then and now.” Erin Westerman, president of Lionsgate Motion Picture Group, said, “Dennis Rodman is more than a basketball player, more than a personality—he's an entire cultural phenomenon. His bold style and physical presence, combined with an iconic persona, created a larger-than-life impact on and off the court. LaKeith and the incredibly talented team on this film will bring the legend to life in this most extraordinarily unbelievable story.” Produced by Lord Miller's Phil Lord, Chris Miller and Aditya Sood, executive producers include Ari Lubet, Dennis Rodman and Lucy Kitada will executive produce. Meredith Wieck and Pavan Kalidindi will oversee for Lionsgate. Stanfield is represented by CAA, Stark Management and Ginsburg Daniels Kallis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stanfield will portray the Chicago Bulls forward in Rick Famuyiwa's forthcoming feature centered around Rodman's trip to Las Vegas during the 1998 NBA Finals. Almost two years after Jonathan Majors was dropped from Lionsgate's 48 Hours in Vegas, LaKeith Stanfield has replaced him in the film to star as Dennis Rodman. He was later sentenced to a 52-week in-person domestic violence intervention program. 'Play Dirty' Review: Mark Wahlberg Lacks the Spark to Sell a Sardonic Master Criminal in Shane Black's Ho-Hum Heist Caper Sherri Shepherd Would "Love" Chris Brown to Appear on Her Talk Show Despite Potential for "a Lot of Backlash" “Dennis Rodman is more than a basketball player, more than a personality — he's an entire cultural phenomenon,” said president of Lionsgate Motion Picture Group Erin Westerman. LaKeith and the incredibly talented team on this film will bring the legend to life in this most extraordinarily unbelievable story.” Ari Lubet, Dennis Rodman and Lucy Kitada will serve as executive producers, while Nikki Baida co-produces.

There's one big secret your favorite celebrities aren't telling you (okay, there are probably a few, but this one really matters): where they get their sneakers. We're talking about ECCO — a quietly powerful footwear brand tucked away in a small town in Denmark, and one we're dubbing: the shoe brand of the coming years. Worn by everyone from Zendaya to Suki Waterhouse and Chloë Sevigny, ECCO has been crafting some of the most distinctive footwear in the industry — and perfecting the art for decades. To understand what's really behind the brand (and why so many people in-the-know swear by it), I traveled to their European headquarters to see firsthand why ECCO has such a devoted (and well-deserved) following. Founded in 1963 by Karl Toosbuy in Denmark, ECCO has spent over six decades doing something remarkably rare: improving without losing its soul (or sole). The brand still relies on processes rooted in its earliest days, staying obsessively loyal to quality, craftsmanship, and values over trends. If we're defining what makes a brand truly “good,” it's hard to find a stronger case than ECCO. Many employees are second- and third-generation team members — parents, grandparents, and relatives who all worked there before them. And here's the wild part: They genuinely seem happy. Maybe it's the town itself (which, true story, helped me track down my lost passport during the trip — not a Hallmark movie, just genuinely good people). Every step of the process, from sourcing leather to final quality checks, has a human touch that you rarely see in global brands. ECCO also takes sustainability seriously — and not in a buzzword, PR way. The brand puts real resources into ensuring its production does more good than harm, even hiring dedicated specialists whose sole focus is on minimizing environmental impact. Thoughtfulness isn't an afterthought; it's built into every movement. They carefully select materials, use innovative production methods, and constantly improve their processes to minimize environmental footprints. It's a brand that considers its legacy not just in style and comfort, but in its responsibility to the planet. Think sneakers that are as comfortable as they are cool, ballet flats that reinvent both design and durability (a major reason Chloë Sevigny is a fan), and boots that are for everything — from hiking trails to city streets. Every style feels intentional, versatile, and meticulously crafted. Beyond everyday footwear, ECCO also produces accessories like leather gloves, wallets, card holders, and even golf shoes — one of their newest innovations and, in my opinion, one of their strongest. Many styles start around $100 and top out around $300 — impressive when you consider the quality rivals luxury footwear that often costs several times more. In a world where luxury often means inflated price tags and quick trends, ECCO offers timeless quality and real value. The brand also runs regular promotions, occasionally offering up to 30% off bestsellers. One of the reasons ECCO shoes last so long comes down to how they're made. The brand uses a special process that fuses the sole and top together, creating shoes that are exceptionally durable and reliable. These are the kind of shoes you wear for years — maybe even decades — without worrying about them falling apart. With ECCO, you're not buying something that disappears after one season. And the longevity doesn't compromise comfort; every design feels like it's been perfected for real-life wear. In an oversaturated fashion market, it's fair to wonder why one brand deserves your attention over another. When it comes to ECCO, the answer is simple: they're doing something different. They're creating shoes that stand the test of time — not just structurally, but also aesthetically. ECCO designs feel timeless while still being fashion-forward. If you're going to invest in fashion you can genuinely feel good about, ECCO is a smart place to start. As someone who shops for a living, I can confidently say the brand is worth every cent. Whether you're looking for an everyday sneaker or a piece that elevates your weekend wardrobe, ECCO delivers. This has allowed the company to partner with incredible fashion entrepreneurs, encouraging them to think outside the box (or more like a shoe box) and create products that feel fresh. Yes, ECCO shows up on the feet of the rich and famous — but it's also worn by people like you and me. It's cool when A-listers love a brand, but it's even cooler when it's a brand you've trusted for years that the rest of the world is finally catching on to. ECCO isn't just having a moment — it's building one. And if what they're doing now is any indication, the future looks incredibly strong. Below, I've listed some of my personal favorite ECCO styles for both men and women. Take a look through their site, and you'll quickly see there's truly something for everyone.

More than most, he enjoys sharing his enthusiasm with moviegoers and smart interlocutors like poet-musician-author Patti Smith (her latest memoir, “Bread of Angels,” is in bookstores). Oscar Isaac joined them for a lively conversation about the awards contender “Frankenstein,” which is currently streaming on Netflix. Here's the December 2 New York Q&A, edited for brevity and clarity. Patti Smith: In the early 50s, when I was a child, I saw, as we all did, James Whale's “Frankenstein” and “The Bride of Frankenstein” and was greatly beguiled and saddened. But when I read, as you did, “The Modern Prometheus” by Mary Shelley, I saw that there was a whole world of imagination and thought processes and the evolution of the creature. But we didn't need him, because you came along and you gave us really something so much more akin that merged your sensibilities with Mary Shelley's. I know how it happened to me. Related Stories The Scariest Christmas Movie Ever Made, Michael Doughtery's ‘Krampus' Demands Reevaluation Welcome to ‘The Lead Up,' A Newsletter Where IndieWire Takes You on The Awards Trail I used to button my shirt all the way up, and had a bowl haircut. I was like a Rutger Hauer son. And in 1969, my father won the National Lottery, and he became a millionaire, and he bought a house, and somebody told him that he needed a library, because he was now a cultured gentleman. So he bought a huge library, which he never visited, and I read everything in there. I read an encyclopedia of art that made me know as much about painting or sculpture as I would have a comic book artist: Jack Kirby or Monet or Manet or Renoir, they were all mixing in my imagination. I read an encyclopedia of health that made me the youngest hypochondriac in history. And that was part of the disappointment. “This child is not well.” They sent me to a psychologist, and he gave me clay and said, “Could you do something with this?” And I did a skeleton. Patti Smith: I've seen this movie now three times, on a little screen, on the airplane, on a bigger screen… One thing that always intrigues me is Victor Frankenstein's body language. It's almost like an artless choreography that becomes art. You make everything seem almost like a dance. It gives the film almost an operatic sensibility. I wanted to ask you about your body language, if that was a choice. Oscar Isaac: It was very much in the conversation with Guillermo. The whole thing, that first scene, when he's in the medical conference, it feels very much like an aria. There were times when I was filming it where I was expecting people to start singing; the sets were so operatic as well. And a lot of the movement came from Kate Hawley's incredible costumes. Oscar Isaac: There was a lot of pleasure in wearing those little black high-heeled boots and running up and down the stairs in those plaid pants and the things that she would put me in, that crazy robe. It also came a lot from Guillermo. Guillermo del Toro: We're still trying to shake it off. Oscar Isaac: The movement was like a symbiosis that happens. Then, when you're giving the exhibition to the courtroom, it's a different sweeping, and then you take Elizabeth in your arms and a different kind of sweeping, the whole thing, your body language is fantastic. Guillermo del Toro: We actually designed the wardrobe to look like '60s London, like he would be coming out with The Rolling Stones or Jimi Hendrix. We wanted him to feel like a rock star. But even using that cape is almost like a matador, yeah, it's expressive, heightened. Guillermo del Toro:  And a lot of hips. Patti Smith:  You're right about the sets. Just throw out Wagner's “Parsifal,” do some of it! Guillermo del Toro: Like a Mexican “Parsifal.” Well, we tried to design as if it was an opera, the big Medusa, the minimal elements that are around everything. I always say there's no eye candy in my movies. There's high protein, because we're telling the story. I can take you through the shapes and the colors, precisely why we designed them like that, but we wanted to make it as a novel, as epistolary. So I wanted to have self-contained color and camera language and shape language in each of the points of view, and if I made the fabric of the main characters, we wove. We created rolls of fabric because all the language and the clothes is from nature, like Elizabeth has natural patterns from minerals, from butterfly wings. And even with the movement, again, to talk about it, starting in this vital place, alive with movement. And then he becomes more creature-like, even with those costumes and the prosthetic leg, as the creature becomes more human. So even those two are rising in opposite ways. Patti Smith: I was so in love with that ship. I love all the Antarctic explorers and Shackleton. Oscar Isaac: Imagine rolling up to the Netflix studio, and there's a fully-sized ship, like the huge, actual-size ship, on gimbals in the parking lot. Patti Smith: It looks like these glass pictures, found in Antarctica. It almost made me feel nauseous, in a good way. Guillermo del Toro: My producing partner felt nauseous when I said, “We're building it for real,” but I was making a point that it should be a handcrafted movie by humans, for humans. There's something that happens when 90 percent of what you're seeing has a physical component. We covered the parking lot with ice. We came up with a method to sandwich translucent solids on the icebergs. And we were inspired mainly by Caspar David Frederick, the glass plates from Shackleton, whatever has been found undocumented. Oscar Isaac: What's beautiful is that, as opposed to it being this horror scene, it's lit so beautifully. There's this beautiful waltz playing, it's him at his most calm and peaceful. Oscar Isaac: Yeah, that's what he knows how to do, make his creature…It's fast, it's passion, it's heightened. We watched movies, different films, to find the tone of it. Oliver Reed was somebody that we watched; what a complicated, huge, magnetic, and scary person. And Pedro Infante, we watched these 1930s Mexican films. We spoke a lot in the words of telenovelas. [Guillermo] would say, “I need you to give me the Maria Cristina. Come on.” We spoke in Spanish the entire time to each other. For me, it is the mother tongue. My mother spoke to me only in Spanish, even though I grew up here since I was a year old. But there was something about speaking that way, that unlocked a mode of unconscious expression, and giving over to that kind of unbridled expression. Patti Smith: Of the female characters, like Ofelia [“Pan's Labyrinth”], who I love so much, and Elisa [“The Shape of Water”], and now Elizabeth, and they all give themselves. They all feel empathy with something that everyone else would be frightened of or repelled by, they're all drawn. And I wrote my notes, “Who are you in all these films?” I think you're the little girls. You have that eternal young girl longing for a pure love, and they all find it even in death. Guillermo del Toro:  The Catholic part is to suffer. But there is a pristine way of looking at life in all its ups and downs. And both are in the lexicon of existing. Elizabeth is the only modern character [in “Frankenstein”] and the only character that is not alone. It's about loneliness so much, and then for a moment, a brief moment, [she and the creature] are together. The creature and Victor are always in the mirror together because they're part of one single soul, which is what fatherhood and being a child is. You don't realize it's a soul that has been split in two, but Elizabeth and the creature are an emptiness split in two, and they attract each other because they feel that they both were broken in the same way. When you think of Jimmy Cagney or Oliver Reed, they're not naturalistic, but they're real. I like the heightened sensation that you're in a movie, you're not in the real world. But all that goes to hell if Elizabeth looks at the creature and she sees makeup. She has to see it like a real soul. So, every time they were together, I would shoot them at 36 frames. So I would be able to slow down when she enters with the dress, it floats, and when she's looking at him, I speed it up to 18 frames so her face is vibrating. And when she's looking at him, all these little things that you learn through 30 years of craft are invisible, but her performance being real is the key, the performance of Victor and the creature has to be real. He basically becomes a mother in the first four weeks of postpartum. Those three characters form a single soul, Elizabeth, Victor, and the creature for me. He's finished his course, and now the debris of all his work is going to haunt him. But as a girl, I was attracted to the creature. Frankenstein, the monster as James Whale gave us, I was never attracted to him. I felt empathy for him always, even when he accidentally killed the little child; you still have pain for him, but the way that I felt about your creature was completely different. He gave me hope, the idea that he would achieve another level of intelligence or answers to immortality. Guillermo del Toro: The two main inspirations were a statue of Saint Bartholomew in Rome, which is made of alabaster, and the lines are anatomically incorrect, but they're beautiful. There are so many echoes of Christ in the movie with the creature, and we can go through them and raising him, the crown of thorns, the red mantle on his shoulders, the wound on the side when he resurrects after three days, but it's also Adam expelled, and finding a tree with red fruit, and getting to know pain through that. So all the biblical beauty, for me, tells you this is not a repair job, it's a newly minted soul. Therefore, the ruining of it is more painful. The way he treats life is completely cavalier. So the creature needs to be on the same color palette as Elizabeth, and they achieve this sort of translucent alabaster, nicotine oyster grace. And they come together at the end on their wedding night, which I wanted to make the one moment they have together. Jacob, and then I give him three words: Victor, Elizabeth, friend, and the more he accumulates words, the more he knows pain. And with pain comes questions, and with questions comes the need for answers, and he finally achieves Grace at the end of the film. Patti Smith: When [Elizabeth] said, “Who hurt you?” I felt like that phrase hovered over the entire film. I felt like it was echoing over and over, even when the brother died, when the brother says, “You are the monster who hurt him.” He has this realization of how no one really hates the other, it's just human nature or animal nature…The world consciousness, everything. Guillermo del Toro: Pain is basically inevitable, and because we are mammalian hunter-gatherers, we're going to necessarily get in the way, because your hope and my hope are never going to fully coincide all the time. And that's why I wanted to paraphrase the book in giving the creature its own voice and [making] it a fairy tale. The wolves don't care, but they're going to hurt you, and that's a fact. My father was kidnapped in 1998, kept for 72 days. And we had to go through it, and continue functioning, because you cannot stop functioning. And the final image comes from that. I said, “Why does the sun rise, when I'm in pain?” And then the question became, “Why am I in pain when the sun rises?” You have to give yourself to that grace of a metronome that is much larger than your woes. So brutality is part of the language that structures reality. The familiarity that I have with Mary Shelley, my mother had many miscarriages. I had two siblings younger than me, and whenever she went to the hospital, I thought s”he's gone, she's not coming back.” “Who hurt you?” comes from a fairy tale, Oscar Wilde's “The Selfish Giant.” When he raises the baby Jesus and he says, “Who hurt you?” I love that. Horror, parable, and fairy tale are closely related. Horror articulates trauma in a way that no other genre does, except fairy tale and parable. Every other tale can be sadistic or not, and in a more Jungian way. But those two, they are turning to aesthetics, pain, horror, and beauty. Patti Smith: Well, thank you for being the eternal child.
