                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Criminal profiling promises certainty in the face of horror: this is what a killer looks like, this is how they think, this is how we stop them. But what if that promise is mostly an illusion? In this episode, Michael Shermer is joined by journalist and author Rachel Corbett to dismantle the myths behind criminal profiling, from the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit to our obsession with serial killers, mindhunters, and “psychological fingerprints.” Corbett explains why randomness is harder to accept than evil, and how our hunger for neat explanations can actually make us less safe.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are endless numbers of UFO claims out there, most of which can be dismissed as coming from crazy people who don't know what they are talking about. Every once in a while, however, evidence comes out that can't simply be ignored. Recently, someone anonymously leaked a video that showed the US military hitting an unidentified anomalous phenomenon (UAP) with a Hellfire missile, and the UAP was barely affected. The leak was sent to Missouri Republican and member of the House of Representatives' UAP Caucus, Eric Burlison. He then posted the video on X, which you can see below: October 30th, 2024: MQ-9 Reaper allegedly tracking orb off coast of Yemen. Moments later, there was an explosion, and the UFO was pushed off its trajectory, but then almost immediately corrected its course and continued moving. The Hellfire missile packs a powerful punch that is capable of destroying even highly fortified tanks. When ABC News requested a comment from the Department of Defense, they got nothing helpful in return: To say this is shocking would be an understatement. There is no human system on Earth (known to the public at least) that could survive a Hellfire strike like this and keep flying, and certainly not do it with little to no apparent damage.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I saw this while watching the "New Thinking Allowed" youtube channel featuring interviews  with scientists and philosophers on metaphysical and paranormal topics by Jeffrey Mishlove. White Crow appears to be a book publisher affiliated with these same authors/thinkers. Their logo looks a lot like that advertisement for Spielberg's Disclosure in Times Square this week! When it comes to UFO sightings, there are several cases that stand out for their credibility and the sheer volume of evidence and witness testimonies. Here are some of the most convincing UFO sightings ever recorded, as discussed by Redditors: Quotes: "The Ariel school incident in Africa is my favourite. What the pilot and co-pilot saw that day was also being tracked by ground radar as well." Description: Military personnel reported seeing strange lights and a craft in Rendlesham Forest. The incident involved multiple witnesses and has been well-documented, including audio recordings from that night. Quotes: "I live in AZ, and saw the Phoenix Lights with my own eyes, (which actually happened twice). It was never given a reasonable explanation, and even our Governor at the time admits he was told to dismiss the story and make fun of it." Description: Military pilots encountered a UFO that was tracked by radar. Quotes: "1976 Tehran UFO incident: Nothing beats this one. Military personals, radars and civilian plane encountered the UFO." Description: Several witnesses reported seeing a large object crash into the water, which was investigated by the Canadian military. Description: US Navy pilots, including David Fravor, encountered a UFO dubbed the "Tic Tac" due to its shape. The incident was captured on FLIR footage and has been confirmed by multiple military officials. Description: Several residents reported seeing a malfunctioning craft and creatures, which led to a significant military presence in the area. Quotes: "Finally in the 90's what appeared to be a malfunctioning ship was sighted near Varginha, MG. Over the next days the army showed up there in large numbers, several creatures were sighted around town." These sightings are often cited as the most credible due to the number of witnesses, official investigations, and corroborating evidence such as radar tracking and video footage.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This horror franchise was born by creative Oren Peli, who conceived of the original 2009 movie's story and screenplay, and also directed the film. After success, Paranormal Activity 2 came out just one year later in 2010. The franchise got fairly back-to-back releases for the first six films and then went on a significant hiatus. The most recent movie in the franchise was Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin, which came out in 2021. Now, another Paranormal Activity reboot film is on the books. The project has found its new director in filmmaker Ian Tuason. Tuason is reportedly in final negotiations for the job. Paranormal Activity 8 also has other notable activity going on with horror icon James Wan joining the team as a producer. In that announcement, it was determined that Paramount Pictures would pair with Blumhouse-Atomic Monster in the upcoming reboot film. While it is possible that the franchise could flounder again, the multiple updates this month are a good sign that this will move forward. As for the selection of Tuason, this will give a big franchise opportunity for an up-and-coming horror director. Tuason only made his debut this year with The Undertone, which premiered at the 29th Fantastia International Film Festival. It received the audience award for Best Canadian Feature. Undertone soon entered a bidding war, and was eventually purchased by A24. This excitement shows that Tuason has gotten a significant start in the horror industry, especially in the paranormal niche. Now, Paramount's work with Tuason on Paranormal Activity 8 can further cement the director as a horror talent to watch out for.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It is directed by Venkat Kalyan and Abhishek Jaiswal and stars Sudheer Babu as the main lead, alongside Sonakshi Sihna. The movie is based on ancient temple lore. These all connect with dark themes and many twists. After its theatrical run, the film is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video in Telugu and Hindi original languages. Jatadhara's trailer was released on October 17, 2025 and showcases the dark world of black magic and ancient practices with supernatural energies. This story starts with the Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple. The mythical practices which are followed in the temples are being questioned and navigated by a few people and there is an ancient, forbidden dark ritual named Pisachi Bandhanam that includes deadly sealed spirits. As the seal breaks, Dhanapisachini awakes and a battle takes place against the ghost hunter named Shiva -- a fight of faith, guarding evil, scepticism, and treasure. The supernatural action-mythological thriller Jatadhara stars Sudheer Babu in an intense role as Shiva. Sonakshi Sinha makes her Telugu debut as the antagonist, Dhanapisachini (Demon of Greed). The ensemble cast also features Divya Khossla and Shilpa Shirodkar, among others. The film is produced by Zee Studios and Ess Kay Gee Entertainment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At an appropriations hearing Friday, Wyoming Adjutant General Greg Porter fielded a question by Senate Committee Chair Tim Salazar about UFOs in Wyoming. Porter said he preferred not to discuss UFOs in open testimony. Halfway through a Wyoming legislative committee's four-week budget-planning marathon Friday, a top lawmaker asked the state's adjutant general about the prevalence of unidentified flying objects overhead, which the government now calls unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP). “I'm asking if you've had any incidents of UAPs over your airspace?” asked Senate Appropriations Chair Tim Salazar, R-Riverton, during Friday's meeting of the committee at the state Capitol in Cheyenne. Salazar in a follow-up phone interview said he asked the question because news of UAPs frequenting U.S. military installations “has become more of a concern” following national media reports. Salazar's question came during Porter's presentation about a bill passed this year that gives Gov. Eight Wyoming sheriffs confirmed receiving reports of strange drone-like sightings, or seeing the objects themselves, in a series of January interviews with Cowboy State Daily. Citing concerns about conflicts with federal agencies and laws, Gordon vetoed the bill when it reached his desk in March. If the department bought that equipment, it would likely be obsolete in 12-14 months, he said. “As we continue to look at that problem, it's pretty significant.” In comments similar to those of Gordon's veto letter, Porter noted that the Federal Aviation Administration "really frowns on people taking out unmanned private drones, under any circumstances.” Porter continued: “There are some significant authorities that are out there that we've not been able to overcome yet in terms of the ability to interdict drones.” Ultimately, said Porter, his department agreed with the governor that “we're not going to pursue that (technology) at the moment.” Among Wyoming sheriffs who saw strange objects in flight last winter, Niobrara County Sheriff Randy Starkey made headlines first. He told Cowboy State Daily on Dec 13, 2024, that strange objects flew over his county in the Lance Creek area starting in late October 2024. Those continued into March or early spring, Starkey told Cowboy State Daily on Friday. Starkey still has no answers about who sent them or what they were, he said. “We never got anybody to come forward and say, ‘Yeah, that was us,” Starkey said. Besides Starkey, four of the eight sheriffs who interviewed about object sightings in December and January also spoke to Cowboy State Daily on Friday. Those four all said they don't know of any mysterious flight or mysterious drone reports placed after approximately late January. • Washakie County Sheriff Austin Brookwell - who said "(the) last ones I think we found out were just agriculture drones." Odenbach referenced a Thursday news report by the Buffalo Bulletin about a drone sighting over the town that had caused “concern.” Buffalo Police Chief Sean Bissett, to whom Odenbach referred Cowboy State Daily, said that was just a recreational drone and officers spoke with its operator. Gordon's veto in March, however, left Grossnickle with both understanding and concern. On the other hand, he said, he still had flying objects and safety worries tied to them as of early March. Sweetwater County residents and law enforcement both had seen strange objects flying in formation over critical infrastructure like the Jim Bridger power plant; and an air medical pilot saw one in the air that appeared to be surveying the ground below with a light, Grossnickle's office said at the time. UFOs, or UAPs, have cleared lore status and entered multiple congressional hearings. Congress heard what CBS News called “stunning testimony” of pilots' UAP sightings in September 2023. The U.S. House Oversight Committee held a Sept. 9 hearing on protection for UAP whistleblowers. Among other witnesses, the committee hosted a former geospatial intelligence specialist for the U.S. Air Force who told them he suffered retaliation after reporting a disturbing encroachment at the NASA hangar at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia. “This craft interfered with my telephone, did not have any sound, and the material it was made of appeared fluid or dynamic,” Borland added. “I was under this triangular craft for a few minutes, and then it rapidly ascended to commercial jet level in seconds. It displayed zero kinetic disturbance, sound or wind displacement.” Military veterans, a seasoned journalist, and a senior policy advisor for the Project on Government Oversight all pushed the committee to develop whistleblower protections in this area. Most of those said they'd seen strange objects as well. All four departed simultaneously, in a “highly synchronized, near-instantaneous manner. No sonic boom or conventional propulsion signatures were observed,” Wiggins wrote. “Location and time stamps are visible in the source video frames published by journalists,” he added.</p>

Among other witnesses, the committee hosted a former geospatial intelligence specialist for the U.S. Air Force who told them he suffered retaliation after reporting a disturbing encroachment at the NASA hangar at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia. “This craft interfered with my telephone, did not have any sound, and the material it was made of appeared fluid or dynamic,” Borland added. “I was under this triangular craft for a few minutes, and then it rapidly ascended to commercial jet level in seconds. It displayed zero kinetic disturbance, sound or wind displacement.” Military veterans, a seasoned journalist, and a senior policy advisor for the Project on Government Oversight all pushed the committee to develop whistleblower protections in this area. Most of those said they'd seen strange objects as well. All four departed simultaneously, in a “highly synchronized, near-instantaneous manner. No sonic boom or conventional propulsion signatures were observed,” Wiggins wrote. “Location and time stamps are visible in the source video frames published by journalists,” he added.</p>
