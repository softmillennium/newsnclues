                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An army of industry lobbyists met with Democratic governors this week, days before Trump issued a new executive order. If you value progressive media, please make a year-end donation today. Polls show that a majority of US voters — and especially Democrats — want more robust guardrails on artificial intelligence, but Democratic governors' silence on President Donald Trump's directive banning states from regulating AI has some observers asking if lobbying by the powerful industry is to blame. Sludge‘s David Moore and Donald Shaw reported Friday that tech titans including OpenAI and Meta last week sent a small army of lobbyists to meet with attendees of the Democratic Governors Association's annual meeting, held this year at the swanky Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix. According to the report, lobbyists and governors — some of whom “are teasing White House bids in 2028 or rumored to be in the mix” — gathered for a closed-door meeting. Wes Moore were among those who reportedly met with the lobbyists. Trump signed an executive order trying to prevent states from regulating AI and following through on the safety laws they enacted, but there was little public pushback from Democratic governors.AI lobbyists descended on the DGA winter meeting last weekend in Phoenix, per a list we obtained: The meeting preceded Trump's Thursday signing of an executive order aimed at limiting states' ability to regulate rapidly evolving AI technology. The order directs the US Department of Justice to establish an AI Litigation Task Force empowered to sue states that enact “onerous and excessive” AI regulation. While Democratic governors were silent, their Republican counterparts have been loudly arguing for months against the federal government preempting state AI policies. In June, 17 Republican governors sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune [R-SD] and House Speaker Mike Johnson [R-La.] warning them against preempting their states' protections on AI use. Over the past couple months, a trio of Republican governors—Spencer Cox (Utah), Ron DeSantis (Fla.), and Sarah Huckabee Sanders (Ark. Newsom, who many observers believe is eyeing a 2028 White House run, especially disappointed proponents of AI safeguards last year when he vetoed what would have been the nation's strongest AI safety regulations. It's not just Democratic governors — congressional Democrats have increasingly partnered with an industry expected to soon be worth trillions of dollars. Some Democrats, like Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, are personally invested in AI stocks. Other Democrats, including some who may have their sights set on higher office — notably Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York — advocate stronger guardrails on AI development. Regulating AI is winning issue for Democrats but their own party leaders are too complicit with Silicon Valley to use it. Citing voters' desire for stronger regulation, Heer argued that “Democrats have a tremendous opportunity to use the AI backlash for wedge politics,” adding that “it's a way to win back working-class voters who are already disillusioned with the GOP and Trump.” December is the most critical time of year for Truthout, because our nonprofit news is funded almost entirely by individual donations from readers like you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The interdiction was aimed at stopping Tehran from rebuilding its ballistic missile arsenal, which was heavily depleted during its 12-day war with Israel in June, The Wall Street Journal reported. The ship, which has not been publicly identified, was off the coast of Sri Lanka when it was boarded by US special operatives who confiscated its cargo, which an official said comprised dual-use components capable of use as conventional weapons. “That is much more dangerous than chemical precursors,” he added. Donald Trump's administration has taken an increasingly interventionist maritime strategy. The operation took place weeks before the US on Wednesday seized a sanctioned oil tanker near Venezuela, which had been used to transport oil to Iran. Iran is attempting to rebuild its shattered ballistic missile arsenal, having bombarded Israel with around 500 during their 12-day war in June. Roughly 1,000 more are estimated to have been destroyed in Israeli strikes. The UN imposed an arms embargo on Iran, and a ban on uranium enrichment and activity related to ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons. The US seized Iranian oil shipments from several tankers in 2020 and 2023, claiming they were violating sanctions and that proceeds would be used to fund Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the US and several other countries have named a designated terrorist organisation. Two Democratic congressmen last month urged Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, and John Ratcliffe, the CIA director, to investigate several shipments of sodium perchlorate from China to Iran. Raja Krishnamoorthi and Joe Courtney suggested the chemicals could be used for missile propellants and claimed Beijing “seems increasingly emboldened to assist Tehran's rearmament efforts with impunity”. Last month, the US Treasury sanctioned dozens of entities around the world as part of its “maximum pressure” policy, claiming they had been used to procure supplies for Iran's ballistic missile and drone production. “We've just seized a tanker on the coast of Venezuela, a large tanker, very large – the largest one ever seized actually,” Mr Trump announced.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Several regions of Ukraine have endured a night of Russian drone and missile attacks targeting energy infrastructure that left more than a million households without power, according to the interior ministry. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia had used more than 450 drones and 30 missiles and that more than a dozen civilian facilities around the country had been damaged overnight Friday into Saturday. “It is important that everyone now sees what Russia is doing – every step they take in terror against our people, all their attacks, for this is clearly not about ending the war,” Zelensky added. The strikes also injured several civilians and left many areas without water supplies, regional authorities said. Interior minister Ihor Klymenko said the strikes had delivered “painful blows to Ukraine's energy sector,” with the Odesa and Mykolaiv regions particularly impacted. The attacks come as US President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff prepares to meet Zelensky and European officials in Berlin for talks on advancing the US plan for a peace settlement in the nearly four-year-old war. Russia has focused on crippling Ukraine's energy infrastructure as winter sets in and has been able to strike more targets in recent months by firing a mix of several hundred drones and missiles simultaneously. In Odesa, “the targets were port and energy facilities. Ukraine's largest power company DTEK said 20 electrical substations had been damaged in the Odesa region. Video supplied by DTEK showed personnel beginning to clear debris at the site of one of the power substations that had been hit. Kuleba added that in the southern city of Kherson, the regional capital was without electricity, affecting more than 140,000 customers. Water supplies there have been reduced to four hours a day while repair work continues, according to local officials. In the north, Chernihiv was struck more than 30 times overnight, according to Vyacheslav Chaus, head of the regional military administration. For its part, the Russian defense ministry said more than 40 Ukrainian drones had been intercepted overnight. Several apartments were struck in the southern city of Saratov, according to the regional governor Roman Busargin, killing two people. On Friday, three Turkish-owned ships were damaged in Russian attacks on ports in the Odesa region, according to Ukraine's navy spokesperson. Germany is set to host Witkoff, the US envoy, as well as European and Ukrainian delegations, in the coming days for further negotiations on a US-backed plan for ending the war. After talks among European, US and Ukrainian officials in Paris on Friday, France said Europeans, Americans and Ukraine needed to agree on common ground in peace negotiations with Russia. “The Ukrainians have not made a deal on the territories, are not considering a deal on the territories today, are not considering a DMZ,” or demilitarized zone, it added. What happened on territory was bound up with security guarantees, the presidency said in a briefing. On Friday, Russia said it had not seen the new peace proposals that resulted from the talks between Europe, the US and Ukraine, adding that it may not like them, according to Russian state media. This will naturally provoke a corresponding reaction; I don't think we'll be entirely happy with it either,” Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov said. The Khartiya corps reported that since September, more than 1,000 Russians had been killed and nearly 300 wounded as Ukrainian units counterattacked. More than 200 Russian soldiers were currently surrounded, the Khartiya corps added. Geolocated video published on Friday showed Ukrainian forces operating throughout the town. Last month, the Russian defense ministry claimed that Kupiansk had been captured and the remnants of Ukrainian forces surrounded. CNN's Max Saltman, Gul Tuysuz, Darya Tarasova and Pierre Bairin contributed reporting.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Belarus freed Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski, key opposition figure Maria Kolesnikova and dozens of other prisoners on Saturday, capping two days of talks with Washington aimed at improving ties and getting crippling US sanctions lifted on a key Belarusian agricultural export. The US announced earlier Saturday that it was lifting sanctions on Belarus' potash sector. In exchange, President Alexander Lukashenko pardoned 123 prisoners, Belarus' state news agency, Belta, reported. A close ally of Russia, Minsk has faced Western isolation and sanctions for years. Lukashenko has ruled the nation of 9.5 million with an iron fist for more than three decades, and the country has been repeatedly sanctioned by Western countries both for its crackdown on human rights and for allowing Moscow to use its territory in the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. John Coale, the US special envoy for Belarus who met with Lukashenko in Minsk on Friday and Saturday, described the talks to reporters as “very productive” and said normalizing relations between Washington and Minsk was “our goal,” Belta reported. We're constantly talking to each other,” Coale said, adding that the relationship between the US and Belarus was moving from “baby steps to more confident steps” as they increased dialogue, according to the Belarusian news agency. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private diplomatic negotiations, described the release as “a significant milestone in U.S.-Belarus engagement” and “yet another diplomatic victory” for US President Donald Trump. The official said Trump's engagement so far “has led to the release of over 200 political prisoners in Belarus, including six unjustly detained U.S. citizens and over 60 citizens of U.S. Bialiatski, a human rights advocate who founded Viasna, was in jail when he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022 along with the prominent Russian rights group Memorial and Ukraine's Center for Civil Liberties. He was later convicted of smuggling and financing actions that violated public order — charges that were widely denounced as politically motivated — and sentenced to 10 years in 2023. Bialiatski told the AP by phone Saturday that his release after 1,613 days behind bars came as a surprise — in the morning, he was still in an overcrowded prison cell. After isolation, I need to get information about what's going on,” said Bialiatski, who seemed energetic but pale and emaciated in post-release videos and photos. He vowed to continue his work, stressing that “more than a thousand political prisoners in Belarus remain behind bars simply because they chose freedom. Driven to the Ukrainian border, she briefly broke away from security forces at the frontier, tore up her passport and walked back into Belarus. Among the others who were released, according to Viasna, was Viktar Babaryka — an opposition figure who had sought to challenge Lukashenko in the 2020 presidential election, widely seen as rigged, before being convicted and sentenced to 14 years in prison on charges he rejected as political. But it later said it was clarifying its report about Stefanovic's release, and Bialiatski told the AP that Stefanovic had not been freed, though he hopes he will be soon. Most of them were brought into Ukraine, Franak Viachorka, Tsikhanouskaya's senior adviser, told the AP. Eight or nine others, including Bialiatski, were being sent to Lithuania on Saturday, and more prisoners will be taken to the Baltic country in the next few days, Viachorka said. Freed Belarusian nationals “at their request” and “after being given necessary medical treatment” will be taken to Poland and Lithuania, Ukrainian authorities said. When US officials last met with Lukashenko in September, Washington said it was easing some of the sanctions against Belarus. She added: “But let's not be naive: Lukashenko hasn't changed his policies, his crackdown continues and he keeps on supporting Russia's war against Ukraine. That's why we need to be extremely cautious with any talk of sanctions relief, so that we don't reinforce Russia's war machine and encourage continued repressions.” Tsikhnouskaya also described European Union sanctions against Belarusian potash fertilizers as far more painful for Minsk that those imposed by the US, saying that while easing US sanctions could lead to the release of political prisoners, European sanctions should push for longterm, systemic changes in Belarus and the end of Russia's war in Ukraine. Belarus, which previously accounted for about 20% of global potash fertilizer exports, has faced sharply reduced shipments since Western sanctions targeted state producer Belaruskali and cut off transit through Lithuania's Klaipeda port, the country's main export route. “Sanctions by the U.S., EU and their allies have significantly weakened Belarus's potash industry, depriving the country of a key source of foreign exchange earnings and access to key markets,” Anastasiya Luzgina, an analyst at the Belarusian Economic Research Center BEROC, told AP. “Minsk hopes that lifting U.S. sanctions on potash will pave the way for easing more painful European sanctions; at the very least, U.S. actions will allow discussions to begin,” she said. Coale told reporters that Lukashenko had given “good advice” on how to address the Ukraine war, saying that Lukashenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin were “longtime friends” with “the necessary level of relationship to discuss such issues.” “Naturally, President Putin may accept some advice and not others,” Coale said. The Lithuanian government this week declared a national emergency over security risks posed by meteorological balloons sent from Belarus. The balloons forced Lithuania to repeatedly shut down its main airport, stranding thousands of people. Earlier this year, Lithuania temporarily closed its border with Belarus, and Belarusian authorities responded by threatening to seize up to 1,200 Lithuanian trucks they said were stuck in Belarus.</p>

This scene is shocking, but it should not be surprising to anyone who has followed the trajectory of the U.S.'s drone wars. This tactic is familiar from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, and, most recently, Gaza, where the Israeli military has used much worse violence to conduct genocide. Instead, the Trump administration is using sheer violence to terrorize non-white populations and, as usual, has normalized lethal force far from declared battlefields and without any legal mandate. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has approved at least 21 additional strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific since September, killing at least 87 people. Instead, it has embraced escalation and mass murder as official policy. The Trump administration claims that suspected smugglers are “narco-terrorists” and therefore legitimate targets. But as Khalil Dewan, a legal scholar at London's School of Oriental and African Studies who has studied U.S. and British drone programs for years, told me: “Drug trafficking is a crime, not an armed conflict.” U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has approved at least 21 additional strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific since September, killing at least 87 people. Dewan is clear: these are extrajudicial killings taking place on the high seas. Even if known traffickers were on board, it would not give the military the authority to launch missiles at a civilian vessel,” she told me. Ling also raises a question the military prefers not to confront: Who bears responsibility? “We were taught to disobey unlawful orders,” she said. “I'm still waiting to see that principle applied to those who carried out strikes on civilian boats in international waters.” The U.S. drone program did not begin with Trump. Its first lethal strike took place on October 7, 2001, in Kandahar province, targeting Taliban founder Mullah Mohammad Omar. That pattern — high-value targets declared dead, only to reappear alive — became common. Figures like Osama bin Laden's number-two Ayman al-Zawahiri and Sirajuddin Haqqani were repeatedly targeted with drone strikes, many of which killed civilians, only to reemerge alive. What happens in the Caribbean today is not an anomaly. As these failures accumulated, the program expanded geographically. But many of the most consequential shifts happened under Barack Obama. Somalia is still being drone bombed by the U.S. today. The definition of a “combatant” widened beyond recognition. A 2012 New York Times investigation revealed that the Obama administration considered every “military-age male” near a strike zone to be an enemy fighter unless proven otherwise — an inversion of the most basic principles of civilian protection. After his death, Obama's press secretary blamed Abdulrahman's father, alleged al-Qaeda militant (and also a U.S. citizen) Anwar al-Awlaki for the aftermath. Obama also institutionalized the weekly “kill list,” which evolved into a bureaucratic process for targeted killing. Critics warned at the time that any president could inherit this system and use it with fewer constraints. Trump has not only expanded the use of drone strikes but also removed the few modest oversight mechanisms Obama left behind. Now, under his second administration, the U.S. is openly striking vessels in international waters with almost no pretext. The administration's argument — that these strikes disrupt drug smuggling — collapses under scrutiny. Criminal activity does not transform international waters into battlefields, and drug runners do not become combatants simply because Washington declares them so. In fact, this is the ultimate break with decades of legal norms. For years, critics of the war on terror have warned that a globalized drone program, paired with militarized domestic security agencies, would eventually produce consequences within the Americas too. At the same time, Washington claimed to have killed “three violent drug-smuggling cartel members and narco-terrorists.” Carranza leaves behind a wife and five children. What happens in the Caribbean today is not an anomaly. The world was declared a battlefield long before Trump returned to office.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. lifted sanctions on Belarusian potash in exchange for the release of over 100 political prisoners in Belarus, many of whom were transferred to Ukraine. "Per the instructions of President Trump, we, the United States, will be lifting sanctions on potash," U.S. presidential envoy to Minsk John Cole said on Dec. 13 following a meeting with Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko. "This is a very good step by the U.S. for Belarus," Cole said. The move comes amid a warming of relations between Washington and Minsk and follows the lifting of sanctions on Belarus's flag carrier, Belavia, in November. Potash is one of Belarus's key exports and its most significant mineral resource, with the state-owned producer Belaruskali ranking among the world's largest suppliers. Of those released, 114 of them were transferred to Ukraine, including prominent opposition figures Maria Kalesnikova and Viktor Babaryka, a former presidential candidate in the disputed 2020 election, HUR said. Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski was also released. First of all, the American diplomats, the American government officials, who made an effort for us to be free," Bialiatski said. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate was told to ask for a pardon, but declined to do so, he said, adding that he was only told of his release earlier in the day. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, exiled Belarusian opposition leader, told journalists in Vilnius on Dec. 13 that she is still awaiting a full list of those who have been released. Eight released political prisoners, including Bialiatski, were transferred directly to Vilnius, Lithuania, while the rest "unexpectedly" ended up in Ukraine, according to Tsikhanouskaya. She is coordinating with Polish and Ukrainian authorities to ensure the safe transfer of prisoners to the Lithuanian border, she said. "Now we have more than 100 people in Ukraine, we will try to agree now with the Polish, Ukrainian, American, and Lithuanian blocs about further steps, so that they can all move, at least to Lithuania, to Vilnius, so that we can see them here tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. But again, there is no solution yet," Tsikhanouskaya's chief political advisor, Franak Viachorka, told the Kyiv Independent. The released prisoners were taken to Ukraine "at the very last moment" despite initial plans for all to arrive in Lithuania as Minsk's attempt "to harm people," he said, adding that Kyiv was not expecting the arrival of the released prisoners, but that they are now "secured, and they are being treated" in Ukraine. Tatsiana Khomich, the sister of Kalesnikava, said she had spoken with her and that Kalesnikava appeared well and was now free, a Kyiv Independent journalist reported on the ground. "We knew about the possible release for a long time," Khomich told reporters. And, of course, I could not believe it until now." Khomich added that lifting sanctions on Belarusian potash in exchange for the release of political prisoners was a "fair price." U.S. sanctions imposed on Belaruskali in 2021 forced Belarus to redirect its potash shipments via Russia, tying Minsk more closely to the Kremlin economically. The U.S. also removed the private jet used by Lukashenko's family from its sanctions list and authorized three additional aircraft linked to Lukashenko to operate. Tsikhanouskaya told reporters that the release of prisoners may reflect Lukashenko's desire to continue dialogue with U.S. President Donald Trump, but stressed it does not signal any fundamental change in his regime. It is leverage to make dictators do something," Tsikhanouskaya said. "Lukashenko will not release people because he somehow became humane. Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus since 1994, is widely seen as a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

Former election staff coordinator to Babaryka, Ivan Kravtsov, expressed hope that the release of political prisoners is a step in the right direction.

I think we will come to this," he said. Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus since 1994, is widely seen as a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Veja doesn't do surveys or freebies, hates greenwashing and Black Friday, and as demand for trainers wanes, it continues to go its own way In the grand hierarchy of Paris fashion, it's tricky for a brand to stand out. Especially one whose coup de maître is a goes-with-everything white sneaker. Yet 20 years after Veja first began selling sustainable footwear, it has become the ultimate affordable It brand for scooter-wielding mums, sustainably minded millennials and A-list bigwigs who want to wear their values on their ethical leather-clad feet. Veja's co-founder Sébastien Kopp says he doesn't know if people buy his trainers because of how they are made or because of how they look. When the actor Emma Watson wanted a pair, she did what no celebrity has ever done, “and she bought”. The actor Marion Cotillard once listedit as a favourite brand alongside Valentino and Alexander McQueen, and it's been reported that the company even received a request from the maximalist costume department of Emily in Paris (on this, Veja prefers not to comment). What Veja does know is that it has sold almost 15m pairs worldwide. Oversized clothing is popular right now, but inherently casual. Veja makes sports shoes, but the earlier models, which are most popular, are in effect trainers for people who don't want to wear trainers. Still, these are strange times for shoes. Of the 23bn shoes produced each year, about 60% are trainers. But according to Katy Lubin, the vice-president of brand and communications at the fashion marketplace Lyst, “demand for sneakers is currently down around 30% year on year”. The trend forecasting agency WGSN said sneakers were projected to decline next year, too. People wants boots and loafers, says Lubin. It doesn't help that right now, no sneaker style dominates. Gen Z are wearing slimline shoes such as Puma Speedcats, whereas millennials, such as Chanel's creative director, Matthieu Blazy, are still wearing Nikes (Blazy wore his for his debut Chanel bow). On the catwalk you'll see Asics at Cecilie Bahnsen, and Prada went so far as to design its own. “Stan Smiths are comparable, yes, but have always skewed younger,” says Shah. While Stan Smith had cultural cache – Jay-Z once rapped about them – “Veja's values are more linked to responsible purchasing rather than trends.” It helps, too, that they're French, which grants them a certain chicness. Until 1980, Veja's Paris headquarters were the French Communist party's printing building. Veja began phasing out vegan sneakers because “the more we looked at leather, the more we realised natural materials have better traceability”, Kopp says. Vegan leather is often just polyester or plastic. Kopp launched the brand with his childhood friend François-Ghislain Morillion – they both worked in finance – after noticing a lack of shoes that advocated ethical practice and traceability in their production process. The company now employs 500 people and has produced 14m pairs of sneakers, reaching the commerciality and ubiquity it once arguably resisted. The sticking point with the ideal sustainability model – which advocates a “don't make, don't buy, don't throw anything away approach” – is that there are also jobs at stake. For this reason, Kopp thinks the issue is consumer moments such as Black Friday. “The word recycling has been co-opted,” he says. This is particularly true in footwear where a single pair of sneakers can contain up to 40 different materials. “This is not just hard to recycle, it's virtually impossible,” says Daniel Schmitt, Veja's head of repair operations. For this reason, it now runs several cobblers, the idea being that one pair can be recycled – “or reborn”, says Schmitt – up to five times. As the global capital of swank, recycling is not something you associate with Paris fashion. But nor is fast fashion and yet last month, Shein opened a shop in the French capital. “It's not crazy at all,” Kopp says. That its practices “show what's fine with our supply chain and what's wrong with the supply chains of others” is just how it goes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and federal officers detain a migrant as he walks out from a hearing during targeted detainment at a U.S. immigration court in New York City, U.S., October 27.David Dee Delgado/Reuters U.S. President Donald Trump is expanding his crackdown on foreign nationals, announcing a series of measures that would further limit legal immigration and make it harder to visit the country as a tourist. While Mr. Trump has mostly focused his immigration clampdown and rhetoric on those who entered the country illegally, the recent moves represent a sweeping effort to also curb those trying to come to the U.S. lawfully. “Millions more in our country were exploited and were brought in under parole programs without even basic vetting,” during Joe Biden's presidency, she said. “We simply cannot go back and retroactively vet these millions of folks who came in under Joe Biden. But it did not find that there was no vetting and, earlier this year, lauded the FBI for screening Afghans for potential national-security threats. He came to the U.S. in 2021 under a Biden administration parole program and was granted asylum this year under the Trump administration. These include Afghanistan, Iran, Sudan, Haiti, Venezuela, Somalia and Cuba. This blocks anyone from these places from applying for asylum, a green card, work permits or any other form of immigration. Both the departments of State and Homeland Security are involved in processing cases, while the Department of Justice adjudicates deportation requests. They already face backlogs that mean cases can take years to complete. “All of these different departments and systems are implicated by the sweeping changes this administration is making. All of them would need to increase their resources, their personnel, their budget to still be able to adjudicate cases in a way that doesn't result in a black hole or a crazy backlog,” said Ms. Petit. Ms. Petit was one of nearly 100 immigration judges fired by the Trump administration this year, adding further delays. More Canadians, including children, detained in U.S. for immigration violations, new data show In addition to social-media history, it would require them to give the U.S. government every e-mail address and phone number used in the past decade. The list includes most European countries, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea. Canadian citizens, who are under a different visa-free entry policy, would not be affected. On Friday, Ms. Noem issued a draft decision that, when published officially, will take away temporary protected status for people from Ethiopia. Over the past year, the administration has already ended it for nationals from Haiti, Venezuela, Myanmar, South Sudan and Syria. Hidetaka Hirota, an immigration historian at the University of California, Berkeley, said Mr. Trump's country-specific restrictions resemble U.S. policies from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He pointed to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882; the Immigration Act of 1917, which barred immigrants from the Indian subcontinent and most other parts of Asia; and the Immigration Act of 1924, which limited immigration from Italy, Greece and Eastern European countries. It was not until 1965 that the U.S. abolished these country-based quotas. Some immigrants are more welcome than others and some immigrants are more undesirable than others,” Prof. Hirota said. At a rally this week, Mr. Trump lamented that too many immigrants to the U.S. come from African countries and not enough from Nordic ones. “Why can't we have some people from Norway, Sweden,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Europe and the United States are increasingly at odds over the Ukraine peace process; Donald Trump insists on elections in Ukraine; and EU countries are sharply divided over whether and how to use frozen Russian assets to fund Kiev. Kiev and Brussels have effectively spurned the key provision of the US peace plan, declaring that Ukraine will not agree to territorial concessions, and are now preparing their own version of the document for Washington. Meanwhile, Europeans are clearly seeking to stall any settlement, the Russian Foreign Ministry told Izvestia. This has long been evident to everyone," he said. This realization is gradually reaching the United States as well. Washington has come to understand what the Zelensky regime represents and what Europeans truly seek, First Deputy Chairman of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs Vladimir Dzhabarov told Izvestia. But Trump is categorically opposed to this, because in addition to the high costs of supporting the Ukrainians in this confrontation, a powerful wave of instability is emerging. The bloc's member states are close to approving a decision on frozen Russian assets by qualified majority. Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Izvestia that this would entail serious consequences for the countries involved, as well as for legal entities and individuals. Washington will continue to press Brussels on reaching a peace agreement for Ukraine, Dmitry Novikov, Head of the Laboratory of Political Geography and Contemporary Geopolitics at the Higher School of Economics told the newspaper. The EU must provide Ukraine with military assistance to contain Russia's military pressure, and economic assistance to contain US political pressure. Europe simply does not have such capacity at present," the expert said. It is time for Ukraine to hold elections, US President Donald Trump said in an interview with Politico published on December 9. Trump also did not spare his European allies, noting that they are failing to cope with many issues and are not pursuing the right course when it comes to the Ukrainian settlement, Vedomosti writes. Trump wants by all possible means to push Vladimir Zelensky toward concessions in the settlement process, Pavel Koshkin, Senior Research Fellow at the Institute for US and Canadian Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences told Vedomosti. "Trump understands that the ambiguity surrounding Zelensky's legal status creates a range of challenges for negotiations, and therefore wants to resolve this issue somehow," Koshkin said. He noted that Trump would accept the election victory of either Zelensky or any other Ukrainian politician, because for him the paramount goal is to secure negotiations on terms he considers fitting. Trump's remarks on elections amount to a "black mark" for Zelensky from the American president, political scientist and US specialist Malek Dudakov told the newspaper. As the US sees it, Ukraine's refusal to hold elections effectively turns it into an autocracy, which harms its international image, the expert stressed. In this regard, Dudakov does not rule out that the Americans may seek to replace Zelensky. Governments in the Nordic European countries are increasingly concerned that they are allocating far more financial assistance to the Ukrainian side than other partners, Izvestia writes. The leaders of seven EU member states have already sent a letter to Ursula von der Leyen urging her to accelerate the decision-making process on the so-called "reparation loan" funded by Russian assets – a mechanism that has been widely highlighted in recent media reports. Northern European governments are growing irritated by the fact that they are providing Ukraine with more support than other EU countries, The Economist reported. The publication also noted that last week Berlin provided Kiev with around €100 mln to revive its energy infrastructure, while the Dutch authorities added another €250 mln for arms procurement. "German political elites understand that without external financing, Ukraine will struggle to maintain basic functionality. This reluctance, he said, stems from two factors: reputational and economic. "First, Macron understands that the reputational risks of such an operation are extremely high. <…> Second, Paris is concerned about the French economy, which is experiencing a difficult period and requires assurances of stability for investors and bank depositors," the expert concluded. Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair has been removed from the list of prospective members of US President Donald Trump's not-yet-established "Board of Peace'" for administering the Gaza Strip, following objections raised by Arab and Muslim states. The composition, clearly defined functions, and structure of these new bodies remain unclear. Experts interviewed by Vedomosti argue that the board is unlikely to succeed in Gaza without a durable ceasefire and is set to face profound legitimacy challenges among Palestinians. Despite being excluded from the list of contenders, Blair may still retain a role in future administrative structures for Gaza, including on an executive committee alongside Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, US envoy Steve Witkoff, and senior officials from Arab and Western countries, a source told the Financial Times. Although Blair has a poor reputation among the populations of Arab states, he has extensive experience in Middle Eastern affairs and a deep understanding of regional dynamics, Kamran Hasanov, political scientist at the University of Salzburg, told Vedomosti. First, before it can be launched, the region must achieve at least a durable ceasefire backed by a mechanism for monitoring compliance – something that currently does not exist. Second, Palestinians are unlikely to accept an external governing authority over themselves in its proposed form. Russian President Vladimir Putin has authorized the joint venture between Rosneft and Shell to conduct transactions involving its stake in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC). Experts interviewed by Kommersant suggest that Kazakhstan may have pressed for the JV's exit from CPC's shareholder structure out of concern that 80% of its oil exports could be disrupted. At the end of October, the US Treasury imposed sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil, restricting their subsidiaries in which they directly or indirectly own more than 50%. Because Rosneft continues to control the JV, it is classified under OFAC rules as a subsidiary of a sanctioned entity, meaning that transactions with it are prohibited without an OFAC license, Natalia Strelkova, consultant at the law firm Kamenskaya & Partners, told Kommersant. Senior attorney Ekaterina Tumanova from Kulkov, Kolotilov & Partners believes that US government approval may be required – something she considers "quite likely from a political viewpoint." The presidential decree primarily creates a legal path for Shell to exit the project without being constrained by Russian domestic restrictions, managing partner at Kasatkin Consulting Dmitry Kasatkin noted. According to analyst Natalia Milchakova, Kazakh authorities may have asked the JV to withdraw from CPC's capital structure out of fear that the pipeline could fall under secondary sanctions, effectively halting 80% of Kazakhstan's oil exports. Losing a stake in the CPC is strategically painful but not financially crippling for Rosneft, head of the analytical department at investment company Rikom-Trust Oleg Abelev believes.

MOSCOW, December 13. /TASS/. Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has called European authorities "thimbleriggers" following the decision to freeze Russian assets for an indefinite term.

"Thimbleriggers," she told TASS when asked to comment on the decision by the Council of the European Union on the indefinite freeze of Russian sovereign assets.

According to the European Commission's plan, the indefinite asset freeze is the first stage in the expropriation of Russian assets under the guise of a reparations loan scheme for Kiev.</p>
