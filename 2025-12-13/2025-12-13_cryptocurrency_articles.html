                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ameriks' words came during Bloomberg's ETFs in Depth conference in New York on Thursday, where he said bitcoin lacks the income, compounding, and cash-flow traits Vanguard seeks when it evaluates long-term investments. His dismissive stance comes as Vanguard just opened its platform to crypto exchange-traded funds, allowing its 50 million clients access to regulated investment vehicles from rivals like BlackRock and Fidelity. For years, Vanguard stood against offering cryptocurrency products to clients, reiterating that it saw digital assets as highly speculative and unaligned with its core investment philosophy. As a result, Vanguard does not plan to launch its own crypto-focused ETFs. The decision is notable as bitcoin ETFs have become BlackRock's top revenue source. Still, after Vanguard saw crypto ETFs and funds “have been tested through periods of market volatility, performing as designed while maintaining liquidity,” the firm opened its brokerage platform to these products. Ameriks said bitcoin could eventually show non-speculative value in certain conditions, such as high inflation or political instability, but he argued the evidence is still limited. “You've still got too short of a history,” he said. The annual Nasdaq 100 rebalance saw six companies dropped and three new additions, with changes taking effect on December 22, but bitcoin treasury company Strategy hung onto its spot.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Each speaks to a different kind of investor. But only one of them currently shows the strongest upside potential, Tapzi. If you are searching for the best crypto to invest in right now, you need a mix of early-stage growth, proven stability, and sector diversity. XMR brings privacy-centric appeal but faces growth limits. Together, they paint a clear picture of where the market is heading. Let's break down each token, what makes them move, and why Tapzi continues to outperform both short-term and long-term. Tapzi (TAPZI) is a skill-based GameFi token built around fast competitive games like Chess, Checkers, Rock-Paper-Scissors, and more. If Tapzi reaches $0.10, early presale investors would see a gain of nearly 28×. If GameFi enters a strong bull phase, some analysts stretch the projection toward a $0.20–$0.35 range, placing Tapzi among the best crypto to invest in for high-risk, high-reward portfolios. Why Tapzi Outperforms XMR and XRP Right Now Monero is one of the oldest and strongest privacy-focused cryptocurrencies. It is designed for users who want maximum anonymity in transactions. It uses sophisticated cryptography to hide sender, receiver, and transaction amounts. These factors make XMR a stable long-term pick. Price action is flat, and large pumps are not expected soon. XMR is good for stability but not for explosive returns, especially when compared to early-stage GameFi tokens like Tapzi. XRP is one of the most recognized cryptocurrencies. After years of legal challenges, XRP is finally regaining momentum. It suits low-risk portfolios far more than high-return hunters. One token rarely changes your life, but a balanced basket can. With smart allocation, you build a path toward financial independence, travel freedom, lifestyle upgrades, and long-term comfort. Crypto is a tool through which portfolios can build lifestyles. To complete the diversification model, analysts suggest watching: Sui is a fast, scalable Layer-1 blockchain built for high-performance applications. Its developer activity is strong, and new projects launch on it every week. With growing user adoption and rising ecosystem value, Sui stands out as a solid mid-cap pick for steady, sustainable portfolio growth. Dogwifhat is a high-volatility meme token driven entirely by community energy and social momentum. It thrives during hype cycles and often leads meme-sector rallies. While risky, WIF can deliver sharp, explosive gains during bull phases, making it a powerful speculative addition to a diversified portfolio. It benefits from rising GameFi adoption and provides essential tools for on-chain gaming operations. Tapzi currently tops many analyst lists because of low presale pricing, real utility, and strong upside potential. It is considered one of the best crypto to invest in for early-stage gains. But Tapzi's utility model, GameFi design, and transparent pricing make it more structured than typical meme launches. Yes, but growth will likely be slow and steady. Privacy tokens depend on regulation and niche usage. But huge parabolic runs are unlikely unless institutions accelerate adoption. Early-stage tokens can multiply fast but also fluctuate hard. XMR and XRP offer stability, but the biggest wealth-building window lies in Tapzi's GameFi utility, low presale price, and growing community.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Silver price action made headlines this week courtesy of its parabolic move and a new historic high above $64. There could be more to the precious metal's latest performance than meets the eye, as some analysts believe it may be a precursor to crypto's upcoming rally. If history repeats, then Bitcoin could be headed for a rally in response to the recent silver upside. However, this delay could take weeks or months to manifest in BTC's price action. This latest silver rally into new ATHs suggests that liquidity has been rotating away from gold. Bitcoin price retreated by over 4% after the FED's meeting, while silver and gold rallied. One of the key reasons behind this outcome was stagflation fears. The FED decided to cut rates while inflation was elevated. Moreover, this decision was against the backdrop of rising stagflation fears. This may have discouraged investors from parking their money in risk-on assets such as Bitcoin and altcoins. Instead, the preference for safe-haven assets benefited gold and silver, whose prices have been rallying this week. Analysts have also been debating whether a stagflation environment would be bullish or bearish for Bitcoin (BTC USD). The latter could be a ticking time bomb courtesy of one major factor. There's no doubt that the macroeconomic situation has had a major impact on Bitcoin (BTC USD)  and crypto prices recently. Global liquidity is heavily intertwined with the Japanese Yen, and Japan also happens to be one of the biggest holders of U.S. Treasuries. If Japan raises rates and continues to sell U.S. Treasuries, then the markets may enter another tumultuous phase. This outcome will likely lead to outflows from risk-on assets such as Bitcoin (BTC USD) and altcoins.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a year-end note, Renato Eid, head of beta strategies and responsible investment for Itaú Asset Management, argued that bitcoin's lack of correlation with traditional local assets makes it a useful diversification tool. For local investors, the ride was even bumpier due to currency fluctuations. Eid warned against trying to time the market and suggested a disciplined, long-term mindset. A small, steady exposure to bitcoin, he says, can act as a partial hedge and offer access to global returns, especially as traditional asset correlations become less reliable. “It calls for moderation and discipline: set a strategic slice (for example, 1%–3% of the total portfolio), keep a long-term horizon and resist the temptation to react to short-term noise,” Eid wrote.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As faster blockchain alternatives gain traction in the financial sector, questions arise about whether SWIFT can keep up. SWIFT's recent announcement regarding the integration of blockchain technology into its cross-border payment system has sparked criticism from industry experts. One notable critic, software engineer Vincent Van Code, expressed his concerns over SWIFT's five-year delay in even beginning to prototype the system. “The legacy system is dead, just like Kodak, Blockbuster, and saddlers—all obsolete,” he said. Van Code's comments underscore a growing frustration within the tech community about SWIFT's inability to keep up with the rapid advancements in blockchain technology. In September, SWIFT announced that it was moving forward with a blockchain-based payment system. Critics point out that SWIFT's slow approach to blockchain technology may prevent it from keeping pace with the faster, more efficient alternatives offered by newer blockchain networks. In contrast, SWIFT's traditional infrastructure can take several days to process payments. As customer demand for quicker, cheaper payment solutions continues to grow, the question remains whether SWIFT will be able to meet these evolving expectations. SWIFT faces mounting pressure from newer, more agile blockchain solutions. In recent years, companies like Ripple have gained significant traction by offering faster and more affordable cross-border payments. Ripple, for example, has already received approval as a U.S. bank and is expanding its reach in the blockchain payments space. Les Purves, an industry commentator, noted that large banks with global reach already possess the liquidity needed to support blockchain-based transactions. Smaller banks, however, may look to companies like Ripple for faster solutions that they cannot access through traditional networks. Van Code also highlighted that SWIFT's customers would likely abandon its services once faster alternatives become available. With blockchain platforms offering real-time settlement and lower fees, the traditional SWIFT model may soon seem outdated. While SWIFT's announcement mentioned using a blockchain-based ledger, some experts argue that its system may not meet the fundamental characteristics of true blockchain technology. Edward, another critic, described SWIFT's proposed ledger as a system that allows banking institutions to view payment statuses in real-time but does not offer the transparency or decentralized nature that is central to blockchain's promise. Some financial institutions, like Sony Bank, are already preparing to issue their own stablecoins in collaboration with companies like Ripple and Circle, which may put additional pressure on SWIFT to adjust its strategy. While regulatory uncertainty has slowed the widespread adoption of blockchain in traditional finance, experts predict that the financial sector will eventually be forced to adapt to new technologies. SWIFT's future in the blockchain space depends on its ability to address both technological and regulatory challenges. While its blockchain plan is still in the early stages, it remains to be seen whether SWIFT can overcome its delay and develop a system that is competitive in the fast-evolving payments landscape.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum's MACD turns green, but charts highlight $3,900 resistance, a $2,400 flag risk, and IWM comparison. Ethereum's MACD turned green after a three month stretch, while a separate chart kept the spotlight on $3,900 as the key breakout level. Meanwhile, another setup warned of a potential flag driven drop toward $2,400 as ETH also drew fresh comparisons with IWM, a Russell 2000 proxy. Ethereum's momentum indicator flashed a fresh bullish signal after the Moving Average Convergence Divergence line turned positive for the first time in about three months, according to crypto trader Merlijn The Trader in a post on X. Ethereum USD 2 Day Price Chart with MACD: Source: Merlijn The Trader via X However, the same chart showed a sharp two day downswing on Coinbase. ETH USD printed an open near $3,325, then fell to a low around $3,058, before closing near $3,063, a drop of about $262, or 7.88%, based on the price panel shown in the post. Price dipped into that zone during the recent slide and then rebounded, which the post described as support holding. The chart labeled that zone as the level Ethereum “needs to break,” while the MACD panel below showed a bullish crossover and a shift back to green histogram bars. Crypto commentator Mister Crypto said Ethereum is “starting to catch up” to the Russell 2000, in a post on X that paired ETH price candles with a line representing IWM, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF. The graphic plotted both series across the same timeline, with IWM shown as a blue line and ETH shown as candlesticks. The two traces moved in broadly similar waves through 2024 and 2025, including a sharp selloff and a later rebound, based on the chart's layout. Mister Crypto framed that gap as room for Ethereum to close, while the image included a vertical marker suggesting a potential catch up move. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez, known as @alicharts on X, said Ethereum could slide toward $2,400 if a flag pattern on his chart plays out. The setup followed a steep drop, then a rising, tight channel that formed between two upward sloping trendlines.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Figure Technology Solutions, the blockchain-focused fintech firm best known for tokenized asset markets and on-chain lending infrastructure, has submitted a second Initial Public Offering (IPO) application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This time around, the fintech seeks to gain permission to make its own equity available directly on a public blockchain with this recent IPO submission. This move comes just a few days after Figure Technology's recent listing on Nasdaq. According to Cagney, this recent public offering aims to establish what he refers to as “a new version of Figure equity on a public blockchain,” with a particular focus on Solana. Cagney also noted that it will not rely on brokers such as Robinhood or leading firms like Goldman Sachs. Preferably, it will be issued and made available for trade directly on the blockchain via Figure's alternative trading system. Cagney referred to this trading system as “essentially a decentralized exchange.” The American entrepreneur also argued that investors can utilize the tokenized security within DeFi protocols, which will enable them to borrow against it or lend it out, following the introduction of equity directly on Solana. Meanwhile, sources close to the situation mentioned that the firm's main objective extends further than merely tokenizing its own shares, citing an earlier statement from Cagney. “One of our main goals is not only to bring equity into the Solana ecosystem but also to allow for native Solana equity issuance,” he said. Following Figure's latest decision, analysts acknowledge that Solana has already positioned itself as one of the largest public blockchains by activity. With this classification, they also discovered that Solana is increasingly becoming a crucial player in the tokenized assets market, gradually boosting its holdings in the real-world asset (RWA) market over the past year. He made these remarks although Ethereum has solidified its position as a leader in tokenization today. This prediction was released when Wall Street announced that it was carefully examining the viability of tokenized assets over time. To support this claim, research from RedStone highlighted that Solana is a “high-performance challenger” in the RWA field, particularly in tokenized US Treasury markets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Figure Technology Solutions, the blockchain-focused fintech firm best known for tokenized asset markets and on-chain lending infrastructure, has submitted a second Initial Public Offering (IPO) application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This time around, the fintech seeks to gain permission to make its own equity available directly on a public blockchain with this recent IPO submission. This move comes just a few days after Figure Technology's recent listing on Nasdaq. According to Cagney, this recent public offering aims to establish what he refers to as “a new version of Figure equity on a public blockchain,” with a particular focus on Solana. Cagney also noted that it will not rely on brokers such as Robinhood or leading firms like Goldman Sachs. Preferably, it will be issued and made available for trade directly on the blockchain via Figure's alternative trading system. Cagney referred to this trading system as “essentially a decentralized exchange.” The American entrepreneur also argued that investors can utilize the tokenized security within DeFi protocols, which will enable them to borrow against it or lend it out, following the introduction of equity directly on Solana. Meanwhile, sources close to the situation mentioned that the firm's main objective extends further than merely tokenizing its own shares, citing an earlier statement from Cagney. “One of our main goals is not only to bring equity into the Solana ecosystem but also to allow for native Solana equity issuance,” he said. Following Figure's latest decision, analysts acknowledge that Solana has already positioned itself as one of the largest public blockchains by activity. With this classification, they also discovered that Solana is increasingly becoming a crucial player in the tokenized assets market, gradually boosting its holdings in the real-world asset (RWA) market over the past year. He made these remarks although Ethereum has solidified its position as a leader in tokenization today. This prediction was released when Wall Street announced that it was carefully examining the viability of tokenized assets over time. To support this claim, research from RedStone highlighted that Solana is a “high-performance challenger” in the RWA field, particularly in tokenized US Treasury markets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks looks on before President Donald Trump signs executive orders earlier this year. David Sacks, President Trump's influential adviser on artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency, is on the defensive over government paperwork that critics say grant him "carte blanche" to shape U.S. policy while retaining hundreds of investments in the tech world. Sacks did divest from some tech holdings like Amazon, Meta, and Musk's xAI, but public documents show that he and his firm, Craft Ventures, maintain more than 400 investments in tech firms with ties to AI. Kathleen Clark, a government ethics expert at Washington University in St. Louis, characterized the sweeping nature of the waiver as highly unusual. Instead, they were aimed at enabling Sacks to profit from his government position," she said, describing the waivers as "like a presidential pardon in advance." Clark said the waivers are essentially saying: "Go ahead and take action that would ordinarily violate the criminal conflict of interest statute, we won't prosecute you for it." After The New York Times recently published an investigation into Sacks' AI and crypto holdings, dozens of his friends in the tech world rushed to his defense on X, heaping him with praise and maligning the newspaper. "While Americans bicker, our rivals are studying David's every move. I've known David for decades, and I've never seen him sharper or more necessary," billionaire Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff wrote on X about Sacks, who is also a billionaire. As the Times was looking into Sacks, he said he hired a defamation law firm to send threatening letters to the paper, which Sacks claims "willfully mischaracterized or ignored the facts to support their bogus narrative." Sacks declined to speak with NPR but addressed the controversy on his podcast, All-In, which he continues to co-host even as he works at the White House. "The truth is that I divested hundreds of millions of dollars in positions in promising technology ventures at a substantial cost to my net worth," Sacks said. He emphasized that the Office of Government Ethics approved his public waivers and concluded he had no conflicts of interest among his venture firm's investments. The conflict-of-interest questions come just as Sacks landed a major victory with Trump's signing of an executive order Thursday which aims to undo some of the more than 100 laws states have passed to regulate AI. In particular, OpenAI, Google and the venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, have lobbied for months for the measure, saying a patchwork of state laws could hamper the AI boom and give China an edge. On Friday, appearing on Bloomberg Tech, Sacks said: "What we need is a single federal or national framework for AI regulation." Steve Bannon, Trump's former chief strategist, has emerged as a key opponent to Sacks' policies, calling for a pause on AI labs' pursuit of superintelligence until the risks are better understood. "I think the issue with Sacks is, to me, it's not he's got these conflicts. My bigger problem is his judgment," Bannon told NPR shortly after he had spent time lobbying against Sacks' policies at Trump's Mar-a-Lago. Bannon said Sacks is focused solely on the tech industry's growing dominance, with no regard for public safety. "Right now, you have more regulations, ten times more regulations, to open a nail salon on Capitol Hill than you have into one of the most promising yet one of the most dangerous technologies ever invented," Bannon said. "My question to this group: Where's the risk mitigation? This concern is amplified by Sacks' history: two years ago, he was one of the loudest voices advocating for a government rescue of the failed Silicon Valley Bank. "When you start talking about their equity, and if the taxpayer is going to step up and give a guarantee, and that's gonna be kind of chopped up and dealt out, we're gonna see what kind of public servants these guys are," Bannon said. Sacks, in his posts on X, has sent mixed messages about the specter of a federal bailout for the tech industry. Last month, he wrote that if one of the major AI frontier labs, like OpenAI and Anthropic, fails, others will take its place. "There will be no federal bailout for AI," Sacks wrote. But in another post weeks later about the surging pace of AI investments that has analysts fearing a bubble, Sacks wrote: "A reversal would risk recession," he said. Clark, the ethics expert, said she thinks this shows that "if the bubble breaks, there will be a lot of heart ache, and the folks who have invested in those bubbles are going to be asking for a bailout."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is not some random crypto payroll platform move, but a serious signal that institutions are warming up to digital assets. It's one of the first institutional debt issuances on a public blockchain, and it involves big names like Galaxy Digital, Coinbase, and Franklin Templeton. This could be a game changer for how financial markets operate. Blockchain tech is shaking up the financial sector, giving it a much-needed dose of transparency, security, and efficiency. Traditional banking methods can feel like they belong in the stone age with their slow transaction speeds and high costs. That could streamline everything and lessen the need for middlemen. Crypto payroll and digital banking startups are just the beginning of this transition. J.P. Morgan's arranged a short-term commercial paper issuance for Galaxy Digital on Solana. Key players like Coinbase and Franklin Templeton are involved, pointing to a growing interest in digital assets via blockchain infrastructure. J.P. Morgan is showing that they are ready to explore new options for financial efficiency. Well, its high throughput and low transaction fees make it a perfect fit for commercial paper issuance. Traditional methods are often bogged down by multiple intermediaries and long settlement times. Solana, on the other hand, offers near-instant settlements and lowers counterparty risk. In the fast-paced world of corporate borrowing, this efficiency is crucial. As institutions navigate the maze of digital asset regulations, working with credible players could boost trust and legitimacy. This could be a blueprint for future blockchain initiatives, emphasizing compliance-focused innovation in the crypto banking landscape. Well, if more institutions start using blockchain for securitized instruments, we might see a spike in stablecoin usage and digital asset investments. This could change the game for traditional finance, forcing businesses to rethink how they handle crypto payments and treasury management. J.P. Morgan's commercial paper issuance on Solana is a landmark event that highlights the transformative potential of blockchain technology in finance. As institutions increasingly embrace digital assets, the future of blockchain in traditional finance looks promising. As we move forward, the integration of blockchain into financial markets will continue to evolve, offering exciting opportunities for businesses and investors alike.
