                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At San Diego Comic-Con, HBO Max unveiled a new trailer for the second season of DC Studios' series, Peacemaker, starring John Cena. The brand-new Peacemaker trailer arrives two months after DC Studios teased fans with an initial teaser. In the teaser trailer, we saw Peacemaker being interrogated by Maxwell Lord (Sean Gunn), Guy Gardner (Nathan Fillion), and Hawk Girl (Isabela Merced). Peacemaker's cameo in Superman, DC Studios' summer blockbuster, highlights his role as DC Studios' resident anti-hero and serves as a connection between the original and rebooted cinematic universes. This unique position places him in an interesting limbo that the upcoming second season appears eager to explore. Although the world may not recognize them as genuine heroes—likely overshadowed by the headline-grabbing heroism of Smallville's caped superhero—Peacemaker and his gang have a mountain of trouble ahead that they need to sort out. Key among those issues aside from that is Peacemaker's long-awaited confrontation with Rick Flag Sr. (Frank Grillo) on account of killing his son in The Suicide Squad and a confrontation with himself, literally, when the other Peacemaker discovers that Chris is mooching off of his life and dimension. At the time, and especially following the cataclysmic conclusion of Superman, its positioning as DC Studios' next big thing raises several questions about how it'll address what director, writer, and DC Studios head James Gunn will carry over from its first season and what won't. Fortunately, Gunn provided some insight into what fans can expect ahead of Peacemaker's second season and how its hero's pocket universe gate compares to Lex Luthor's. “Lex's version is much jankier than the one in Peacemaker. What the whole season of Peacemaker revolves around is that,” Gunn told Entertainment Weekly. It's more akin to Philip Roth's [1996 novel] The Counterlife than it is to the third Spider-Man movie [2021's No Way Home]… I love that movie, but it isn't about that. Fans can look forward to finding out firsthand what lies in store when Peacemaker season two premieres on HBO Max on August 21.

Whether you have plaque or not isn't considered, you need to be on Crestor right now to prevent it from starting anyway.My cholesterol started really going up in my late 40s and I can concur an aggressive change to my diet where I significantly reduced my saturated fat intake and I lost about 20 pounds made absolutely no difference, and my total cholesterol started hitting 300, so I'm on the Crestor. My initial dose did cause me to have elevated liver enzymes and my total cholesterol went to about 170 in about a month, so I'm on an extremely low dose on alternating days.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Star Trek faces an uncertain future at the moment, as shows that helped define its streaming renaissance end one by one, and little is known about what lies on the horizon (especially thanks to current events in our own world). So it's perhaps fitting, then, that the one new show we do know is coming is all about welcoming a new generation back to Star Trek‘s fundamental ideals after a similar period of uncertainty: Starfleet Academy. To close out today's packed Hall H panel at San Diego Comic-Con, Paramount released the first trailer for Star Trek: Starfleet Academy. The new trailer, aside from being packed with references to all of Star Trek history (from Academy wing names to courses on figures like Captain Sisko), introduces us to a whole host of new and familiar faces as classes begin. Athena, a long-lived half-Lanthanite (the same humanoid species as Strange New Worlds‘ Commander Pelia, played by Carol Kane) who also serves as the Academy's chancellor. Among the senior staff at the academy, she'll be joined by Discovery‘s Tig Notaro and Voyager‘s Robert Picardo, reprising their roles as Jett Reno and the Emergency Medical Hologram simply known as the Doctor, respectively—they'll also be joined in a guest star capacity by Discovery‘s Mary Wiseman and Oded Fehr as Sylvia Tilly and Admiral Vance, respectively. Of course, an academy needs students, and Starfleet Academy will follow a whole host of new recruits making their way through training. Giamatti plays Nus Braka, a seedy gang leader (and himself another half-Klingon, this time a Klingon/Tellarite hybrid) who has some ominous connections to one of the new cadets at the academy. The first season of Starfleet Academy is set to begin streaming on Paramount+ in early 2026. The show has already been renewed for a second season.

And it was at a Coldplay concert in Massachusetts that the company's CEO Andy Byron and Chief People Officer Kristin Cabot were apparently caught dancing together on the “kiss cam.” When Byron and Cabot (who are reportedly married to other people) awkwardly tried to hide from the camera, Martin joked, “Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy.” Footage of the exchange exploded in popularity, ultimately leading both executives to resign from Astronomer. In announcing Byron's resignation, the company said, “Our leaders are expected to set the standard in both conduct and accountability, and recently, that standard was not met.” “We've been thrilled so many people have a newfound interest in data workflow automation,” she says. Paltrow even finds time to plug the company's upcoming conference before concluding, “We will now be returning to what we do best — delivering game-changing results for our customers.” Amplify your reach, spark real connections, and lead the innovation charge.

Nvidia's long-rumored and long-delayed N1X SoC has broken cover once again, this time revealing its GPU capabilities through a fresh Geekbench OpenCL listing. We've seen various CPU-focused leaks surrounding this chip before, but this provides our first genuine look at the GPU. That being said, this isn't final silicon—it's an early engineering sample—but the details are enough to show where Nvidia is headed with its first consumer-class ARM SoC for laptops and possibly desktops. The Geekbench entry confirms a 20-core CPU setup split into two 10-core clusters, built on Nvidia's Grace architecture. More importantly, it confirms 48 Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs), translating to 6,144 CUDA cores—the exact count as the desktop GeForce RTX 5070. Interestingly, these specs also match Nvidia's GB10 Superchip, which currently powers the DGX Spark AI mini-PCs, suggesting that N1X might be a repurposed, possibly lower-power version aimed at the mainstream market. After all, they're both ARM-based chips developed in unison with MediaTek. Even in this state, the N1X's iGPU is already outpacing every modern integrated GPU, including Apple's M3 Max and AMD's 890M, which top out at around 37,500 in similar benchmarks. Earlier leaks revealed its CPU performance was competitive but not earth-shattering, which is to be expected from unfinished drivers and firmware. With the latest listing, Nvidia is signaling a hybrid approach: pairing a Blackwell GPU core array with an ARM-based CPU cluster, aiming for a balance of AI performance, gaming, and efficiency—similar to how AMD's Strix Halo and Apple's M-series chips are positioned. Rumors suggest a Q1 2026 release, possibly timed to coincide with the next wave of AI-focused Windows laptops, as Microsoft appears to be holding up on that at the moment. For now, Nvidia's N1X sits in the shadows, a prototype with the specs of a mid-tier discrete GPU and ambitions to push iGPU performance into uncharted territory.

As ITHome reported, China is pushing its domestic GPU efforts into uncharted territory with Lisuan Tech's first consumer and professional graphics cards, the 7G106 and 7G105. While the spotlight is on gaming performance, Lisuan is positioning these chips as multi-purpose accelerators for AI, cloud rendering, and even metaverse applications. Its single 8-pin PCIe connector also suggests a TDP of around 225W. What sets Lisuan apart from past Chinese GPU attempts is its claim of building the TrueGPU architecture from scratch, including the instruction set, compute core, and software stack. The company touts "intelligent multitasking" with up to 48 concurrent tasks, out-of-order triangle rendering for 50% faster efficiency in certain scenes, and dual FP32/INT32 instruction emission. There's also a unique matrix memory layout designed to boost memory efficiency by 40%, along with dynamic load balancing that distributes rendering and compute tasks across cores in real time. Lisuan even claims NRSS, a proprietary rendering quality optimization system designed to rival Nvidia DLSS and AMD FSR.

Gaming demos were equally noteworthy: Black Myth: Wukong and Wuchang: Fallen Feathers both ran at over 70 FPS in 4K High settings, while Shadow of the Tomb Raider topped 80 FPS under similar conditions. High-profile titles like these running on a GPU architecture in its infancy paint a very positive picture for the platform's stability, more so than raw performance numbers. The 7G105 professional variant leans heavily on AI and enterprise markets, supporting SR-IOV virtualization with up to 16 containers. Lisuan highlights its applicability for cloud gaming, digital twins, virtual reality, and even robotics. The company claims its eXtreme series cards are ready to handle large AI models such as DeepSeek and Wenshengtu, extending their utility beyond traditional PC gaming. Lisuan's announcement marks a new phase for China's domestic GPU ambitions. While past efforts, such as Zhaoxin's integrated solutions and Moore Threads' early discrete GPUs, struggled to break into the mainstream, Lisuan's 6nm designs represent a bold attempt to close the gap with global players. If its claims of architectural independence and performance parity hold up under independent testing, this could be the first time a Chinese GPU maker truly competes with AMD and Nvidia in the discrete GPU space. Pricing and final clock speeds are yet to be announced.

Twitter/X-based @YuuKi_AnS, probably better known for their contributions to the silicon rumor mill, including various high-profile leaks, is the creator behind these upcoming Apple M1 Pro hair clips. The Goofish link in the Tweet doesn't provide any further images, so what you see above is all we have to get a feel for this new fashion line. After examining the image in detail, it appears that Yuuki_Ans has already converted about half of their M1 Pro samples into hair clips. You can see 10 of the chips, on the left, seemingly propped up by a colorful hair clip-style assembly affixed to their undersides. According to the Goofish retail site, seven of these hair clips are already reserved. If you want one and have access to this marketplace, moving with haste is recommended.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week on the GeekWire Podcast, my guest is Brad Anderson — a former Microsoft corporate vice president who spent more than 17 years at the Redmond company. In fact I've been a guest on two of his shows back when he was a leader in enterprise mobility and cloud technology at Microsoft, when it was all the rage for executives to have their own video shows. And there was “The Ship Room,” where he talked about the cloud transformation and played games with guests, challenging me to distinguish real startups from fake ones. Qualtrics, the experience management technology company, has dual headquarters in Seattle and Provo, Utah. For this week's show, I went to the Qualtrics Tower in Seattle to talk with Brad about how he thinks about building tech today, and how AI agents are changing the experiences the company creates and measures. In the final segment, I turned the tables on Brad with a game about cloud and AI terms called “Real or Ridiculous” (see below). … With our Gen AI enabled surveys, what we call conversational feedback, it increases to 83%. On AI's impact on engineering productivity: “What we're seeing right now is, Cursor is literally generating millions of lines of new code for us. The changing shape of engineering organizations: “I think, as an industry, there will be fewer entry level [positions]. If a typical pyramid for an engineering organization is that 20%, 15% of their engineers are entry level, that probably goes down by 3% to 5% over the next couple years.” And here's the quiz that I gave Brad in the final segment, which I created with help from ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ioannina, a lakeside town in northern Greece surrounded by mountains, is not the kind of place you expect to find cutting-edge artificial intelligence quietly reshaping medicine. Yet, inside its main public hospital, Dr. Tzimas is doing just that. From spotting rare diseases like Q fever to managing conflicts among junior doctors, Dr. Tzimas has woven AI into the rhythm of daily medical life. However, he believes that AI will not be able to replace the essential human interactions that are at the heart of his work. “AI can't feel pain responses or smell signs of illness.” This interview is part of our series How Do You Use AI?, where we ask people one simple question: How do you use AI? Gizmodo: How does AI fit into your daily medical practice? Dr. Tzimas: AI acts as an assistant that helps us work faster and more reliably. Gizmodo: Can you give a specific example of how AI assists with patient care? There are extensive tables of drug interactions, but they're difficult to access quickly when you're with a patient. AI systems can provide this information very easily and without mistakes. It also helps with adjusting dosages for patients with conditions like renal insufficiency or hepatic failure, where normal doses might be harmful. Gizmodo: Are you concerned about AI “hallucinations” or inaccuracies in the medical field? Dr. Tzimas: An experienced clinician can spot hallucinations right away. If you prompt the AI with very strict protocols, they do not hallucinate. The “temperature” setting of AI models is crucial; for the medical field, it needs to be set to 0.3, which makes them very strict and prevents them from fantasizing or hallucinating. Gizmodo: Do you use AI for personal matters? Dr. Tzimas: I use AI for almost all my emails, especially within the communication platform among doctors. I use a “negotiator GPT” prompt that makes answers very diplomatic. This is particularly useful when there's a conflict among junior doctors, as I have to maintain integrity and prevent conflicts while still being strict. It helps me reply in a way that smooths over potential issues, like an accomplished diplomat would. Dr. Tzimas: I also use AI to create teaching materials very quickly. For instance, I can take a complex clinical case from a journal like the New England Journal of Medicine and ask the system to create multiple-choice questions from it. AI also helps me summarize large articles and complex medical cases from journals for easier discussion. This has freed up a lot of my time. Dr. Tzimas: AI tools are really capable for differential diagnosis. With AI, we can narrow down the possibilities to less than 10, and then through clinical examination, imaging, and consultations, we narrow it down to one. The system can even remind you of really rare conditions that might be happening to your patient. Gizmodo: When was the last time AI helped you in a case? We used AI to consider what diseases could be contracted from dust in such a stable. One of the highly-ranked differential diagnoses was Q fever, which is very rare. Although it came back negative and the final diagnosis was unrelated, the AI system identified Q fever as a potential possibility, which opened our horizons. Without AI, Q fever might not have even on our list. As AI spreads, people with health questions will use it to get analyses of their symptoms. This means doctors also need to use AI for support, paperwork, and even creating dietary plans for patients. Gizomo: Does AI replace the need for administrative staff, like a personal assistant? Now, I dictate notes on my iPhone, copy-paste them into an AI system, and it creates a nice email. Also, I can take pictures of paper documents, and AI can transcribe them into a digital form, saving tons of time and creating digital archives. My job involves experience that AI cannot yet replicate. Human interaction, like looking a patient in the eyes, observing their demeanor, and assessing their hygiene, provides crucial information that AI cannot easily replace. AI helps save time, but it needs an experienced physician to input those essential details. Gizmodo: How does AI affect your work-life balance? Preparing teaching material used to take me hours; now I just spend an hour or a couple of hours and I'm ready. So I have more time for my personal life.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The creators of the popular card game “Taco vs. Burrito” — dreamed up by a Seattle 7-year-old in 2018 — are exiting with a significant win. It's kind of crazy to think back to it being an idea for my son, and then all of a sudden we've sold a million copies of the game,” Leslie Pierson told GeekWire this week as she recounted the journey she had with her son Alex, now a 15-year-old high schooler. Pierson said she, her husband Mark Butler, and Alex have always been a big game family. From a young age, Alex liked to learn new games and talk about what he liked and what he didn't. How to make and play it was determined over several months of conversations on their walks. But after six months they were still playing paper iterations of the game, improving on it, and falling in love with it. An inventor and serial entrepreneur, Pierson had experience in product development. She created GoodHangups and launched the magnetic poster-hanging product via Kickstarter before landing on “Shark Tank” and making a deal with Lori Greiner on that hit show. She credits Alex with the inspiration and creation of the “Taco vs. Burrito” gameplay — and for coming up with something that quickly made $25,000 on Kickstarter. “You can just get your product there and then sell it. You don't have a big team, you don't have to support a big retailer or anything like that.” “We've sold over a million and a half games in the past six years, and it just became amazing to do,” Pierson said, noting that it was regularly a top-ranked offering in Amazon's games category. Pierson wasn't interested in hiring a big team or developing new versions of the game to sell more products to existing customers. She was tired of getting ready for the holiday rush, or another Prime Day. The uncertainty around President Trump's shifting tariff policies didn't help either. I surely don't love not knowing what the cost of something is.” As they fold their cards on “Taco vs. Burrito,” Pierson takes pleasure in knowing they provided quality entertainment for families, away from phones and modern digital distractions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GM's EVs have been on a roll lately. One of the things he credits for Tesla's success is how Elon Musk ran product meetings. “No slides was our first rule,” McNeil told the audience earlier this month at TC All Stage in Boston. Every week, senior leadership would sit down with product leaders to review their progress. The practice was inspired by an encounter Musk had with Steve Jobs, McNeil said. “There was this belief that I think is true: Steve Jobs didn't have a ton of time or patience for Elon in the early days. And early in the early days, Elon would try to chase Steve down at events and parties in Silicon Valley for advice. “But one night, Elon got lucky and said, ‘Steve, if you had one piece of advice for me as a young entrepreneur' — he had just just done PayPal and was joining the team at Tesla — ‘what would that be?' And if the product is beautiful, it will sell itself.” Musk took that to heart, McNeil said, and the concept of a perfect product became central to product development at Tesla. “The thing we were looking for first of all was surprise and delight. “Crazy example of that is the fart button,” McNeil said, referring to a software button labeled “Emissions Testing Mode” that would simulate flatulence through the car's speakers. Meetings like those, where the actual product was reviewed, not a mockup, helped preserve Tesla's culture as it grew, McNeil said. “You can imagine the culture that gets communicated when people are bringing their A game to the CEO every week. Every week they're making progress because of the product reviews.” In 2022, he was added to the board at GM. “One of the things I'm most proud of is Mary Barra, CEO, and Mark Reuss, president, [who oversee] a 275,000 person, $200 billion revenue company, are running product reviews every week where there's no slides.

When reached by TechCrunch, Allianz Life spokesperson Brett Weinberg confirmed the breach. The company disclosed the data breach on Saturday in a legally required filing with Maine's attorney general, but did not immediately provide a number of how many Allianz Life customers are affected. According to the spokesperson, Allianz Life has 1.4 million customers. Its parent company, Allianz, has more than 125 million customers worldwide. Security researchers at Google said in June that they were “aware of multiple intrusions” across the insurance sector attributed to Scattered Spider, a collective of hackers and techniques that rely on social engineering techniques, such as deceptively calling and tricking helpdesks into granting them access to a company's network.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. Nemo's Osmo tents have long been WIRED favorites. The Osmo Dagger we reviewed several years ago is still going strong. Earlier this year Nemo revamped the entire Dagger Osmo tent to be fully Bluesign compliant (previously just the fabric was). It now offers slightly more headroom, thanks to a pole redesign. Nemo's Osmo fabric first arrived in 2022 after two years of research, development, and testing. Where most tents are either nylon or polyester, Osmo is a proprietary blend of both. Nemo's product development director, Gabriel Rosenbrien, told WIRED in that one of the company's goals with Osmo was to find a way to overcome the stretching of nylon (which absorbs water and sags), while also avoiding the downsides of polyester—namely, that it's not quite a strong as nylon. I have spent 25 nights now in the previous model and a week in the new one, including one of the heaviest rains I've ever experienced, and I've found Osmo to be plenty durable and great at shedding the rain. Coming in at just under 4 pounds, the Dagger is on the heavy side for what it is, but split between two people the weight is acceptable for what you get. This is an especially livable backcountry tent that's roomier than most. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. At 88 inches long and 50 inches wide, there's just room for two 25-inch sleeping pads, something you won't pull off with most ultralight tents. Lengthwise, I had plenty of room without touching the ends with my bag hood or footbox. I'm 5' 11", but anyone up to about 6'3" would likely be fine. Another nice aspect is that the foot end of the tent doesn't taper inward, which means even at your feet your bag has almost no contact with the sides, making it easier to avoid any condensation. There hasn't been much condensation in my experience, though. There's plenty of mesh at the top (which is also great for staring up at the stars on those clear nights when you don't need the fly), which allows for plenty of airflow. Even on some humid Midwestern nights, condensation coming off the rainfly was not an issue. This is the tallest freestanding tent that I'm aware of, beating the Big Agnes Copper Spur UL2 ($408), which tops out at 40 inches, and Nemo's Hornet 2P ($450) which, while lighter, is also only 40 inches tall. Unchanged from last year is the nice, deep bathtub floor, which comes up about 6 inches, offering good protection from rain back-splash and any runoff from pitching your tent in the wrong place. If you're selecting your pitch site well, this shouldn't happen, but sometimes circumstances intervene and it's dark or you're the last person to the group site and don't have first pick. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. This saves a bit on weight and improves ventilation, but it was one area that worried me when I reviewed the 3-person version years ago. Thankfully this has never been an issue, the bathtub floor (which is what is exposed below the fly) has proved plenty waterproof in my use. It's a little extra triangle of fabric that covers about half the vestibule and protects any gear you've stored there from back-splash and any water that might come under the fly. There are stays in the rainfly to help it maintain its bathtub shape. It's a nice feature I've come to appreciate on rainy days. What I really like about Nemo's tents over other options, like the Copper Spur tents, is the attention to detail. This is not the tent for ultralight backpackers, thru-hikers, or anyone looking for a very low-weight, minimalist structure. If that's you, look to tarps and non-freestanding tents like the Lunar Solo. Again, though, split between two people, I think a 4-pound tent like the Dagger is perfectly acceptable.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The future of self-driving cars in Italy it seems needs not only technology but also (possibly above all) political backing. Among the signatories to the scheme are Milan mayor Beppe Sala and Turin mayor Stefano Lo Russo, as well as dozens of other mayors of medium-size and small cities. While Waymo fulfills more than 250,000 paid rides a week in the four US cities where it operates, and China has established 20 pilot cities with more than 74 million miles of accumulated testing, Europe is limited to 400 highly fragmented micro-projects—of which less than half are nationwide. In the United States and China, private individuals and companies invest billions, while in Europe, public funds are dispersed over initiatives that are too small. Europe's regulatory fragmentation, with 27 different national frameworks (including differing traffic laws, for example), also makes it impossible to exploit any advantage of the region being a single continental market. Italian administrators see autonomous driving as a practical solution to everyday urban problems, such as last-mile urban logistics and reducing traffic and pollution in city centers. For example, the collective mayors' enthusiasm clashes with an inadequate regulatory framework. Italy's new highway code, approved in December 2024, with focuses on new rules for electric scooters, zero tolerance for those driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs, and phone use while driving, has missed an opportunity to bring Italy in line with modern times and positions the country as one of "the last of the old century instead of the first of the new," according to Maran. Insurance companies still do not cover self-driving cars for public service in Italy, while European approval procedures severely limit the number of vehicles a manufacturer can put on the market. Giorgio Gori, another European Parliament member for the Italian Democratic Party, stated that Europe risks repeating the same mistakes made with cloud computing and artificial intelligence, areas where the continent has lagged behind due to regulatory fragmentation and a lack of large corporate players. "We're not good at manufacturing, but from a utilization and grounding perspective we would be great," Gori said, suggesting that perhaps Europe should focus on applying technologies developed elsewhere rather than trying to reign in global competition. "We need to think in both research and production where autonomous driving can create added value for Europe and Italy," he said, pointing out that non-European players are not necessarily looking in the direction of more efficient and less impactful mobility. The European strategy, according to Scuderi, must focus on development models that favor vehicle sharing over private ownership, countering the US trend toward individual car ownership. The Italian mayors' call represents a bet on the future of European mobility that must come to terms with complex geopolitical realities. And the time challenge is crucial: As each month of delay widens the gap with competitors investing billions, Europe must decide whether to focus on technological self-sufficiency or on the smart integration of solutions developed elsewhere. Success will depend on turning the policy debate into concrete actions that involve public and private investment, simplify regulations, and convince citizens that autonomous driving is an opportunity and not a threat. The 60 Italian mayors who have signed on to this autonomous driving initiative show that this technology has some political backing. However, it should be noted that there are just under 8,000 Italian municipalities. “This is not about technology that will arrive tomorrow,” he said, "but about a revolution already underway that Europe cannot afford to suffer passively."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Amazon has acquired Bee, a relatively new AI company that debuted an always-listening wearable earlier this year. Bee cofounder Maria de Lourdes Zollo shared the news via LinkedIn. It didn't save audio recordings, but it used the power of third-party and in-house large language models to transcribe words and create a journal of sorts, offering insights into your day, crafting takeaways, actionable tasks, and summaries of conversations. The Bee acquisition would let Amazon offer its customers a different kind of AI experience from Alexa, one that is with you wherever you are and is always listening. We'll have to wait and see whether Bee's current privacy policies will shift under the new ownership, and what will become of the little yellow wearable. Nothing's sub-brand CMF has a new smartwatch, following up on last year's Watch Pro 2. Even with the $30 price bump, it's still one of the cheapest smartwatches around, though it runs RTOS (real-time operating system), meaning you won't be able to access your favorite apps here. There's a new dual-band GPS for more accurate route tracking, 131 sport modes with a personalized running coach, and a new heart-rate sensor that CMF claims is more accurate across workout intensities and skin tones. The CMF Watch 3 Pro can now track blood oxygen levels and stress, and it offers guided breathing exercises to help you relax. You'll be able to see basic notifications on the watch, and there's now a ChatGPT integration that lets you talk to the chatbot and set reminders, though your phone will need to be nearby for processing. CMF says all of its smartwatches are now transitioning to the Nothing X app, the same app used to configure Nothing's audio products. It officially went on sale July 22, though some regions will have to wait until later this year. Microsoft has announced a new Surface Laptop with an integrated 5G cellular modem, which will use Verizon's 5G network. Although it looks nearly identical to the current Surface Laptop 13.8 (7th Edition), it uses a new “custom multi-layered laminate” material on the exterior rather than aluminum, which Microsoft says “allows radio signals to pass through without impacting performance,” according to the company's blog post. Microsoft also boasts that it has completely redesigned the Surface Laptop to “thoughtfully” and “strategically” integrate the antenna inside to reduce interference. The new device is targeted toward business users, but it's an interesting reversal to the severe lack of cellular laptops recently. When 5G was first rolling out in 2019, laptops with integrated 5G cellular connections were starting to roll out, such as the Lenovo Yoga 5G in 2020. Perhaps Covid killed the momentum, since people were at home with their stable Wi-Fi connections. Or maybe it was because the Qualcomm Snapdragon-powered laptops at that time really couldn't compete with Intel. Interestingly, because it's an enterprise device, the Surface Laptop 5G is actually powered by an Intel Core Ultra Series 2 rather than Qualcomm's Snapdragon X. Microsoft may also be trying to preempt Apple's move into cellular MacBooks. That's the question posed by Palmer Luckey this week. The pro-Trump tech entrepreneur has already stamped his footprint in the worlds of virtual reality through Oculus and military tech through Anduril, but a more conventional computer would be new ground for Luckey. “I actually think Anduril could build computers in the United States,” he stated. I've had conversations with everyone you would need to do this. Luckey goes on to say that the only thing holding him back is that he hopes someone else does it first. Whether or not there will be Anduril laptops in the future isn't so interesting as the larger question of how much it would cost to build technology from the ground up without relying on foreign production. That's less than what analysts have said in the past, including one approximation that stated iPhones would cost at least 25 percent more due to increased labor costs alone. Others have put that estimate much higher—as high as $3,500 for an iPhone, or stated that it's altogether impossible due to supply chain limitations. Google Photos officially rolled out a feature this week that lets you convert static images to videos using generative artificial intelligence. We first saw this capability on an Honor smartphone, but it's now becoming more widely available. Google says the feature is powered by its Veo 2 generative AI model. All you need to do is select the image from your gallery and choose “Subtle movements” or “I'm feeling lucky,” and it'll get animated into a six-second clip (of something that never happened). The company is also adding a feature called Remix, which lets you convert existing photos into art styles, like anime, comics, and 3D animations (remember Prisma?). It'll be rolling out over the next few weeks. All of these effects and features might feel a little much, especially considering all the other tools at your disposal in the app, which is why Google also has a new Create tab. Google's Wear OS 6 update started rolling out this week—it's the latest version of the smartwatch operating system, introducing a more colorful interface, widgets that are even more glanceable, alongside power efficiency improvements for better battery life. One of the oldest watch face apps, Facer—which has hundreds of themed watch face designs across various platforms—has announced an update adding compatibility with Wear OS 6. Facer didn't support Google's Watch Face Format (WFF) when Wear OS 5 launched, which was mandatory to access watch face complications. The company had to work with Google to bring back full functionality of its watch faces to Wear OS 6, and the it even says Facer will deliver “significantly improved battery life” on all faces. The Facer update also adds new collaborations, like a SpongeBob SquarePants watch face, as well as a social component called “Looks.” It's a tab in the app that lets you show off your favorite watch faces. Capture is an iPhone-only camera app that has more than 50 “live presets” with real-time film effects and manual camera settings for better control over the final image. These presets are non-destructive, so you can still edit the original captured image later on if you decide to change things up. It supports RAW and ProRAW formats, has real-time effects like bloom, and can instantly sync with the VSCO app for additional edits or sharing. It's free to download now, and there's no word if an Android app will be available in the future.
