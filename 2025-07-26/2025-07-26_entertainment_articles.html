Revealed at San Diego Comic-Con on July 26, the John Cena-starring DC Comics comes just two weeks after the release of “Superman,” the kinda official-ish soft-ish reboot of the DC Universe courtesy of now-steward James Gunn. The new season, it was revealed during the Comic-Con panel, will take place a month after the events of “Superman.” “Peacemaker” will arrive on HBO Max on August 21 at 9 p.m. ET/PT. In a May interview with Entertainment Weekly, Gunn said that getting back around to “Peacemaker” — which premiered its first season long ago in 2022 — was top-of-mind when he took the DC Universe gig. “Once I was done with ‘Peacemaker,' I had to do ‘Guardians 3,' and then when I was about ready to jump [back] into ‘Peacemaker,' I got hired to be the head of DC,” he said. “As soon as I got that job, I made a couple of calls, and the first one was to [Marvel's] Kevin Feige telling him that I'm taking the [job as] head of DC. Related Stories ‘Starfleet Academy' Teaser, a ‘Khan' Audio Series, and Puppets: The Future of ‘Star Trek' Is Here Jamie Lee Curtis' ‘Murder, She Wrote' Reboot Is Happening, and 2025 Is the Perfect Time for Jessica Fletcher “I developed it along the way, in conjunction with the other DC projects that we're doing, so it's very much connected to ‘Superman' and it's very much connected to what comes after,” he explained. “I had a rough idea of what I was going to do, but it was actually quite different than what the show ended up being.” Apparently, some “Superman” characters are even going to wander over to “Peacemaker.” Gunn has also noted previously, though, that the Marvel Cinematic Universe's rather, uh… universal tone is not the objective for DC. That's one of the things we want to do. The artists — the directors and the writers — each one will bring their own sense to it… That's what we want to bring to the films because we don't want people to get bored. Gunn discussed the direction Cena's character would he taking, saying (via ScreenRant) “Peacemaker is a different guy this season. So, to sum it up, though “Peacemaker” premiered while the previous DCEU was still in its waning days, Gunn was at the helm, and so it is still canon in the new DCU — or at least the second season is really, really canon. Check out the “Peacemaker” Season 2 trailer below and watch on HBO Max August 21 at 9 p.m. ET/PT. By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DC Studios stepped in at San Diego Comic-Con where Marvel Studios use to dwell: the late Saturday spot in Hall H with the James Gunn co-run Warner Bros comic book label bringing the second season of Peacemaker. But there was also more reason for glee, for as the panel's moderator Joshua Horowitz observed: “James this is the first time you've been in front of crowd since Superman.” And with that, Hall H erupted in cheer. The panel kicked off with the new trailer for season 2 which shows John Cena's Christopher Smith enjoying a new parallel dimension he's found. It's a place where he can hook up with Jennifer Holland's Harcourt. Meanwhile, back in the real world, Frank Grillo's Rick Flag Sr (from Superman) is out to close the portal in his face-off with Peacemaker. Says Leota in the new trailer to Chris, “No matter how great the grass is over there, you belong here with us.” 'Project Hail Mary': First-Look Footage Of Ryan Gosling's "Space Caveman In A Placenta Onesie" & Alien Rocky Shown At Comic-Con 'Paradise' Creator Dan Fogelman Unveils Exclusive Season 2 Sneak Peek At Comic-Con That Introduces Shailene Woodley Said Gunn about season 2's Smith: “I really like TV shows where the characters don't just return every season and they're the same exact characters. I want to see change and sometimes regression,” Gunn said. Gunn's Superman leads straight into Peacemaker season 2 with that movie's supporting characters Green Lantern/Guy Gardner (Nathan Fillion), Hawkgirl/Kendra Saunders (Isabel Merced) and Maxwell Lord (Sean Gunn). In addition to the trailer show today, Hall H attendees got to see a clip of Harcourt beating up guys in a bar after they try hitting on her with whistles and cat calls. Gunn called it his favorite day on set until they filmed something for Episode 8, which became his new favorite day on set. Holland also teased that she gets to do a Dirty Dancing lift in the opening credits scene. Season one ends with Chris sitting on his stoop, pondering the complexity of life, next to the ghost of his racist dad, Auggie (Robert Patrick) (it's inferred that the guy will be hanging around like an acerbic Obi-Wan Kenobi in season 2). Meanwhile, Goff, the butterfly who was possessing Sophie, has been kept alive by Chris. Chris' father leaves behind a house with an arsenal of weapons and costumes. Per the logline, the new season follows Christopher “Chris” Smith, aka Peacemaker, the vigilante Super Hero as he struggles to reconcile his past with his newfound sense of purpose while continuing to kick righteous evil-doer butt in his misguided quest for peace at any cost. Following today's Peacemaker sesh, there's a musical performance from season 2 band Foxy Shazam and Steel Panther. Returning Season 2 cast appearing on stage today included Holland, Freddie Stroma, Steve Agee, new cast members Sol Rodriguez and Tim Meadows, Grillo, and Cena. Danielle Brooks came down with illness, seemingly food poisoning, after going out to dinner with Gunn, who got over it by this morning. Gunn also mentioned that Eagley gets his own Lex Luther in Michael Rooker who plays a world renowned eagle hunter. Gunn wrote all eight episodes of Peacemaker and directed three, including the first episode. Greg Mottola, Peter Sollett, and Althea Jones also direct. Based on characters from DC, Peacemaker is produced by Gunn's Troll Court Entertainment and The Safran Company in association with Warner Bros. Television.

Star Trek: Strange New Worlds boldly went exactly where fans wanted them to go with its San Diego Comic-Con panel, delivering a fun presentation that also gave the 6,500-strong crowd in the cavernous Hall H one thing that geeks most: seeing something before anyone else. “We think of you all the time when we are in the writers room and we always talk about what would the fans want and love,” said exec producer Akiva Goldsman. Ryan Gosling Debuts New 'Project Hail Mary' Footage to Explosive Laughter at Comic-Con 'Resident Alien' Team Responds to Cancellation: "I Wasn't Ready" The setting is 1969 Hollywood with the suspects all being actors and makers of a sci-fi series, one that just got canceled, and one that bears a massive resemblance to the original Trek. Also resonating to the Hall H crowd was a speech by Celia Rose Gooding who, in the murder mystery, plays a Hollywood agent who has a monologue about how important of an impact a sci-fi show could have on the world and on making someone watching it feel seen and included. “I've been acting for 25 years and that was the most fun I've ever had shooting anything,” Wesley said on stage after the episode screened. “I wonder if he'll see it,” asked Jess Bush, who plays Nurse Chapel, standing on stage with Wesley. Lead Anson Mount, who plays Captain Pike on the series, wasn't on stage as it was revealed his wife had recently given birth to a baby daughter, Violet. Thus it was teased that in the fourth season, there will be an all-puppet episode, continuing the show's playing around with form, genres and conventions.

She completed her look with sneakers, wired earbuds, and a slouchy bag. In a July 11 feature, Teen Vogue declared Suri has nailed “cool-girl” summer dressing, and praised her for incorporating the “clean girl” aesthetic, a TikTok term used to denote sleek simplicity, without becoming basic. magazine, the stylish teen started college at Carnegie Mellon University in August 2024. Holmes posed with Joshua Jackson in July 2025 to promote their film “HAPPY HOURS” wearing unique frayed two-tone denim pants, after opening up to Vogue in the spring about one of her go-to “outfit formulas” for the season. I usually wear them with a long skirt or baggy pants, so it feels very comfortable,” said the “Dawson's Creek” actress. But Katie Holmes also appreciates an occasion to get dressed up. Katie Holmes famously dated her “Dawson's Creek” costar Joshua Jackson from 1998 to 1999, per Grazia. Now, fans are thrilled to see the pair side-by-side again as they work on their upcoming film, which Bustle says is a “love story.” The photo Holmes posted with Jackson, under which she wrote she “so very grateful” to be working on the project, garnered a quarter of a million likes in three days and greatly excited fans. “JOEY AND PACEY FOREVER,” wrote one, referencing the pair's “Dawson's Creek” characters. Deadline says Holmes is “set to write, direct, and star” in “Happy Hours,” which will be a feature film trilogy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hogan, whose real name was Terry Gene Bollea, died on July 24 following a reported cardiac arrest at his Clearwater, Florida home. While Brooke has remained silent, her longtime friend Ashley Kora took to Instagram Stories with a moving tribute. “My dear sweet friend @mizzhogan lost her father today,” Ashley wrote over a black-and-white photo of Brooke with her dad, as per E! “He died knowing what I know—Brooke loved him deeply, was fiercely loyal, and only ever wanted him to be peaceful, happy, and surrounded by people who valued him for who he really was.” Brooke's husband, retired NHL player Steven Oleksy, reposted Ashley's tribute with a heartfelt message of his own. We are incredibly lucky to have you in our lives—not just during this challenging time, but always.” However, in the weeks leading up to his death, Hulk Hogan and his daughter, Brooke, shared a rare, heartfelt conversation that brought quiet closure. According to TMZ, their final exchange, just two weeks before his 2023 wedding, was emotional, with Brooke expressing love and concern for his health, and Hogan offering a soft apology that she has held onto ever since. Brooke, 37, and her younger brother Nick, 34, are Hulk's children with ex-wife Linda, to whom he was married for 26 years. Despite their split, Linda posted a nostalgic throwback photo with Hulk just days before his death, captioned, “The good old days!” Earlier this year, Brooke welcomed twins, Oliver and Molly, with Steven, marking a new chapter in her life as a mother while still grappling with a complicated family past.</p>

(Check out our ranking of every “Star Trek” live-action show). The message from Paramount+'s presentation for the franchise July 26 at San Diego Comic-Con‘s Hall H isn't boundary- and format-pushing alone: It's clear that they want to package new things with some heavy doses of the familiar — major stars, beloved returning franchise vets, and some cutesy gimmicks. Take a look at the teaser for “Star Trek: Starfleet Academy.” There are a ton of new faces there for the 32nd Century-set show, as much of the cast is teenage and 20-something newcomers. And it's set in a time period, post-“Star Trek: Discovery” that allows for all-new storytelling completely unrestrained by preexisting canon. Related Stories ‘Peacemaker' Season 2 Trailer Drops, Heralding the Next Step in James Gunn DC Universe ‘Coyote vs. Acme' Has the Knives Out for Warner Bros. at SDCC, Plus Release Date Revealed And Paul Giamatti adds just the right edge of menace, whistling the “Star Trek” theme as his “Klingon hybrid” villain, to let us know that Starfleet better look out. Then there's a returning favorite in Robert Picardo's The Doctor, who apparently is not just another hologram in his series, but literally the exact same Doctor from “Voyager” who's survived more than eight centuries to have his story continue on this show. Continuity with his arc from that show is something showrunners Alex Kurtzman and Noga Landau are promising. (A member of the menacing warrior species from “Deep Space Nine.”) And another mysterious “DS9” shoutout as well, as a computer display at the title academy seems to have information on it related to the fate of that show's Capt. And across the “Star Trek” portfolio presented at Hall H, this model of some familiarity being mixed in with the new stuff as a kind of sweetener to make swallowing the unfamiliar more palatable was everywhere. For the first time ever, “Star Trek” is making a push into the audio storytelling space with “Star Trek: Khan,” a podcast about the legendary “Trek” villain in his years after his introduction on the “Original Series” episode “Space Seed” when he and his crew are marooned on Ceti Alpha V. Naveen Andrews, the actor fancast for years as Khan (and should have been cast in “Star Trek Into Darkness”), will be voicing the character. Andrews will be joined by a couple of returning vets: George Takei as Capt. Hikaru Sulu and Tim Russ as young Ensign Tuvok. This is a canon-friendly way of presenting this story as we know from a '90s “Voyager” episode that Tuvok served with Sulu aboard the USS Excelsior. And finally, “Star Trek” is nothing without a good gimmick, and “Strange New Worlds” teased that in Season 4 there will be an episode staged entirely with puppets created by the Jim Henson Workshop. A little felt is the ultimate volumizer, one supposes. That doesn't do anything to counter our charge that “Strange New Worlds” is maybe veering a little too far into the insubstantial, but it shows the elasticity of “Star Trek” in allowing for so many different kinds of stunts. It also reminds me of how in 2005 as an April Fool's Day joke, the StarTrek.com website announced that “Star Trek: Enterprise” would be continuing but only via marionettes to cut down on costs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An investigation is underway in Oklahoma after a television screen in the MAGA state school superintendent's office reportedly showed a video of nude women during an executive session of the State Board of Education on Thursday. The images reportedly appeared on a screen in the office of Ryan Walters, Oklahoma's far-right Superintendent of Public Instruction. Walters previously told schools to teach the Bible and Ten Commandments, demanded students watch him pray for Donald Trump, and named transphobe Chaya Raichik to a state education committee. He also tried to use state money to purchase bibles for classrooms that matched the specifics of those marketed by the president and his family. As you might expect, Walters has led a crusade against “pornography” in school libraries. Two members of the Oklahoma board of education said they were shocked at what they saw on the screen on Thursday. “I was like, ‘Those are naked women,'” board member Becky Carson told The Oklahoman. “And then I was like, ‘No, wait a minute. Something is playing a trick on my eye. Maybe they just have on tan body suits. Carson told Walters to turn the video off. So he acknowledged it was inappropriate just by those words. And he was like, ‘I can't get it to turn off. I can't figure out how to turn it off.' “I don't know if he turned it off or switched the channel, I don't remember,” Deatherage told NonDoc. I didn't ever hear an apology for that being on, and he didn't seem to be fazed that it was on.” Republican state Senate President Pro Tempore Lonnie Paxton told Oklahoma Voice that the Office of Management and Enterprise Services is carrying out an investigation into the incident. “This is a bizarre and troubling situation that raises serious questions about the events and what took place during yesterday's executive session at the Oklahoma State Board of Education meeting,” Paxton said in a statement. “The accounts made public by board members paint a strange, unsettling scene that demands clarity and transparency.” “Some of these board members are blatantly dishonest and cannot hide their political agenda,” Walters told KOKH Fox 25. “It is disappointing that they are more interested in creating distractions than getting work done for Oklahoma families.” Trump Claims Someone May Have Forged His Signature on Birthday Letter to Epstein Walters' communications director, Quinton Hitchcock, called the story a “junk tabloid lie,” according to NonDoc. “Regardless of if recent allegations are true, Oklahomans are in dire need of new leadership at the Oklahoma State Department of Education,” Oklahoma House Democratic Leader Cyndi Munson told KOKH Fox 25. “These are serious allegations made by two members of the State Board and an expeditious third-party review is warranted,” Republican House Speaker Kyle Hilbert said in a statement. “I urge the State Superintendent to unlock and turn over all relevant devices and fully cooperate with an investigation.” “If no wrongdoing occurred, a prompt and transparent review should quickly clear his name,” he added. Last year, the Oklahoma State Department of Education's Library Media Advisory Committee — which includes Raichik, who runs the anti-trans Libs of TikTok social media account — attempted to ban The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini and The Glass Castle by Jeannette Walls from Edmond high school libraries. “Edmond Public Schools not only allows kids to access porn in schools, they are doubling down to keep pornography on the bookshelves,” Walters said in a statement. Instead of focusing on education, EPS has chosen to peddle porn and is leading the charge to undermine parents in Oklahoma.” Trump White House Rages Over ‘South Park' Episode, Calls Show ‘Fourth-Rate' Astronomer Enlists Gwyneth Paltrow as 'Temporary Spokesperson' Amid Coldplay Viral Scandal “Don't just send me a bunch of graphic, sexually explicit photos without where it came from, or what did they do?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trained on the New York stage — she worked with Cicely Tyson in ‘The Blacks' — she also played Victoria Butterfield, one of Bea Arthur's maids, on ‘Maude.' Cleo Laine, Regarded as Britain's Greatest Jazz Voice, Dies at 97 Jazz Legend Chuck Mangione, Known for 'Feels So Good,' Dies at 84 After appearing in the East Village at St. Mark's Playhouse in French dramatist Jean Genet's The Blacks — where she understudied for Cicely Tyson and also worked alongside the likes of Jones, Godfrey Cambridge and Maya Angelou — Warfield made it to Broadway in October 1968 when she was cast as Clara in The Great White Hope, written by Howard Sackler. She received Theatre World and Clarence Derwent prizes for her powerful performance, then accompanied Tony winners Jones and Jane Alexander to Hollywood, where all three reprised their roles in the 1970 film directed by Martin Ritt at 20th Century Fox. In Paddy Chayefsky and Sidney Lumet's Network (1976), nominated for best picture, Warfield sparkled in a scene in which her Laureen Hobbs, an Angela Davis type, meets with Faye Dunaway's Diana Christensen, a UBS executive who wants to do a weekly series revolving around the Ecumenical Liberation Army. His father, Sidney, sold tokens for the New York City Transit Authority, and her mother, Ruth, was a homemaker. Warfield took tap, ballet and acrobatic lessons as a kid, and while attending the High School of Performing Arts in Manhattan did summer stock, appearing in a 1957 production of Take a Giant Step in the Catskills. Later, she studied opera at the Brooklyn Conservatory of Music and acting at the American Institute of Theater and TV Arts. Represented by pioneering Black talent agent Ernestine McClendon, Warfield moved to California in 1977 to join the cast of Maude, on which she made her first appearance late in the fifth season. Her Victoria Butterfield was “not stupid, she is not uneducated, she's very ambitious and stands on her own two feet,” Warfield told Jet magazine in August 1977. She was married to William Horsey from 1967 until his 1993 death. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Anti-Flag frontman Justin Sane has been ordered to pay nearly $2 million in damages to a woman who alleged that he raped her in 2010, Rolling Stone reports and Pitchfork can confirm. The woman, Kristina Sarhadi, filed a lawsuit against Justin Sane, whose legal name is Justin Cathal Geever, in 2023, but the singer never responded to the complaint in court. Judge Sannes handed down her ruling on Tuesday, July 22. She awarded Sarhadi a further $750,000 in punitive damages. Judge Sannes also denied Sarhadi's motion for default judgment with respect to a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress. Sarhadi initially filed her lawsuit in a New York state court, under New York's Adult Survivors Act, but the case was moved to a federal court at the beginning of 2024. Sarhadi's lawsuit arrived months after Anti-Flag's sudden breakup. Justin Sane's former bandmates eventually explained that allegations of sexual assault contributed to the group's dissolution. Justin Sane denied that he committed sexual assault, but numerous women, including Sarhadi, soon came forward to speak with Rolling Stone about Justin Sane's allegedly predatory and abusive behavior.

It's also a reminder of the rising stars Bad Bunny has long endorsed. Back in 2023, when Bad Bunny curated Rolling Stone's Future 25 list, he picked Young Miko as an artist to watch. ” I feel like she has so much to show people, like she hasn't showed people all her tricks yet.” Since then, Young Miko has become a massive breakout act, snagging a Latin Grammy nomination and acclaim for her debut album att., which came out last year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dave Letterman has never been shy about letting TV network management know when they're being idiots, assholes, or any other flavor of pinhead. (Indeed, at least part of the man's mystique, as he himself would note, runs on his love of battling with and tweaking his various corporate overlords over the years.) So it's not entirely shocking to hear Letterman go hard after CBS over its recent conduct vis a vis his successor Stephen Colbert, calling the decision to cancel Colbert's Late Show last week both “gutless” and an act of “pure cowardice.” Letterman was in conversation with his long-time friend and collaborator, Late Show executive producer Barbara Gaines, as well as My Next Guest Needs No Introduction executive producer Mary Barclay, when he launched enthusiastically into the topic. Laying out his own (slightly idiosyncratic) view of events—he remains convinced, against all evidence, Barclay's protests, and in the service of comedy, that Skydance Media is run by twin brothers—Letterman says he doesn't buy that CBS's decision to tell Colbert his current season will be his last was financially motivated. “You're telling me losing this kind of money happened yesterday?” he rhetorically asks, noting, with agreement from veteran producer Gaines, that there are plenty of ways late night shows can tighten budgets before going to the nuclear option. In Letterman's view, the timing is just too obvious: Skydance (which just got FCC approval for its merger with Paramount, which is set to conclude early next month) didn't want a repeat of what went down with Donald Trump's CBS News lawsuit, and so pre-emptively got rid of Colbert before he could continue to deploy his “precise, quick, witty” satirical abilities on Trump's hide. Hilariously, Letterman actually sounds just a tad jealous of Colbert for being dropped into such a clear and obvious hero position, noting that he's “a martyr” who's basically had his position in the TV Hall Of Fame permanently set. “This would have been so great for me.”) All told, it's a withering takedown of the “bottom feeders” Letterman condemns at Skydance (delivering a classically Letterman “What the fuck is Skydance?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The members of prolific Australian rock band King Gizzard And The Wizard Lizard announced this afternoon that they were pulling their music from Spotify, specifically citing the actions and investments of streaming service CEO Daniel Ek. Writing that Ek “invests millions in AI military drone technology,” the band announced on Instagram that “We just removed our music from the platform. (Ek is also chairman of Helsing, which started as an AI software developer before moving into creating and manufacturing its own drones.) Previously, bands Deerhoof and Bay Area indie band Xiu Xiu announced they were making similar moves to pull their music from the service. (Xiu Xiu's statement on their own decision, which they announced yesterday, goes even harder than King Gizzard's, with the band writing that “Although the financial practices of all streaming services is acutely anti-musician, the actions of Spotify to use the profits they made from essentially stealing music in order to murder people to make even more money is almost beyond comprehension.”) King Gizzard actually made two announcements on social media today, also announcing that they were releasing a new collection of demos “Out everywhere except Spotify (fuck Spotify),” and adding, true to the spirit of the thing, “You can bootleg it if you wanna.” The band recently released its 27th album, Phantom Island, and is currently in the midst of an American leg of a 2025 world tour.

Following the annual Hottest 100 at the start of the year, Triple J's next big countdown was all about homegrown music. This special edition mid-year poll was “dedicated to the homegrown artists and tracks that have resonated across generations, and helped define our nation's sound.” In the end, INXS were declared the winner, triumphing for their classic song “Never Tear Us Apart”. Triple j Music Director Nick Findlay said: “Never Tear Us Apart hits just as hard in 2025 as it did almost 40 years ago. It's a song that Australians of all ages can relate to, one that has soundtracked countless memories, and a defining piece of music history we can all celebrate together. “Seeing iconic anthems from the likes of Paul Kelly, The Angels and Missy Higgins stand side by side as equals with modern day classics like Innerbloom, Better in Blak and The Less I Know The Better, has highlighted what we all know – Australia is the home of the best music ever written!” Check out the full countdown below: Get your daily dose of everything happening in Australian/New Zealand music and globally.
