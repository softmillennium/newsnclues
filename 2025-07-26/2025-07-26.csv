            The leaders of Cambodia and Thailand have agreed to meet for ceasefire talks after days of cross-border violence, according to statements on Saturday from both sides as well as US President Donald Trump.
    


            Trump said earlier in the weekend that he had spoken with both Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and acting prime minister of Thailand Phumtham Wechayachai in his efforts to restore peace.
    


Thai-Cambodian conflict pits a well-equipped US ally against a weaker adversary with strong China links



            “They have agreed to immediately meet and quickly work out a Ceasefire and, ultimately, PEACE!” Trump wrote on Truth Social in a series of posts on outlining his diplomatic efforts on Saturday.
    


            Trump said he had warned Hun Manet and Phumtham that he would not make trade deals with either country if the deadly border conflict continued.
    


            “They are also looking to get back to the “Trading Table” with the United States, which we think is inappropriate to do until such time as the fighting STOPS,” Trump wrote.
    


            Earlier this month, Trump wrote letters to Thailand and Cambodia threatening a 36% tariff on most of their exports to the US, starting August 1. Cambodia and Thailand both delivered substantial offers to their US counterparts in an effort to move to the front of the line for a trade agreement, officials said at the time.
    


            In the early hours of Sunday morning local time, Hun Manet thanked Trump and said that Cambodia agreed with “the proposal for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire between the two armed forces.” It added that he had previously called for a ceasefire to ASEAN chair and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
    


            A statement from Thailand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs was more measured, saying it wished to see “sincere intention from the Cambodian side” – but that Phumtham had also “requested President Trump to convey …that Thailand wants to convene a bilateral dialogue as soon as possible to bring forth measures and procedures for the ceasefire and the eventual peaceful resolution of the conflict.”
    


            Bangkok and Phnom Penh have been fighting over territory disputed since colonial power France drew the border between them more than a century ago. The renewed deadly conflict pits longtime US ally Thailand, with decades of experience, against Cambodia's relatively young armed force with close ties to China.
    


            Since fighting broke out on Thursday, more than a dozen people have been reported killed, dozens wounded, and more than 150,000 civilians evacuated. Clashes have continued into Saturday, according to officials on both sides.
    


            The United Nations has condemned the violence, with Secretary General António Guterres offering his assistance “in any efforts towards a peaceful resolution of the dispute” in a statement released Saturday by his spokesperson.

            The leaders of Cambodia and Thailand have agreed to meet to negotiate a ceasefire, according to a social media post by United States President Donald Trump on Saturday.
    


            Trump, who said he held separate calls with the Prime Minister of Cambodia and acting Prime Minister of Thailand, claimed that both countries, “have agreed to immediately meet and quickly work out a Ceasefire and, ultimately, PEACE!”
    


            The news came shortly after Trump called publicly on both parties to negotiate peace amid escalating violence on the disputed border between Thailand and Cambodia.
    


            Bangkok and Phnom Penh have been fighting over territory disputed since colonial power France drew the border between them more than a century ago. The renewed deadly conflict pits longtime US ally Thailand, with decades of experience, against Cambodia's relatively young armed force with close ties to China.
    


            Since fighting broke out on Thursday, more than a dozen people have been reported killed, dozens wounded, and more than 150,000 civilians evacuated. Clashes have continued into Saturday, according to officials on both sides.
    


            Here's a look at the histories and capabilities of the two sides.
    


            Thailand's military dwarfs that of neighboring Cambodia, both in personnel and weaponry.
    


            Thailand's total of 361,000 active-duty personnel spread across all branches of the kingdom's military is three times Cambodia's. And those troops have at their disposal weaponry their Cambodian counterparts could only dream of.
    


            “Thailand has a large, well-funded military and its air force is one of the best equipped and trained in Southeast Asia,” the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) wrote in its “Military Balance 2025” look at the world's armed forces.
    


            Meanwhile, a 2024 ranking of the military capabilities of 27 regional nations by the Lowy Institute places Thailand at 14th, to Cambodia's 23rd.
    


            Such a disparity is perhaps to be expected, given Thailand has four times as many people as Cambodia, and a GDP more than 10 times larger. Unlike Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, it escaped the ravages of the wars that engulfed the region in the second half of the 20th century, and the European colonialism that preceded them.
    


            Overall, with factors including military, economic, diplomatic and cultural power weighed in the Lowy Asia Power Index, Thailand is ranked 10th, considered a middle power, just behind Indonesia but ahead of countries including Malaysia and Vietnam.
    


            Lowy ranks Cambodia as a minor power in Asia, grouped with countries such as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Laos.
    


            In an earlier Truth Social post on Saturday, Trump said he has spoken to the acting prime minister of Thailand, Phumtham Wechayachai.
    


            “I have just spoken to the Acting Prime Minister of Thailand, and it was a very good conversation,” he wrote. “Thailand, like Cambodia, wants to have an immediate Ceasefire, and PEACE. I am now going to relay that message back to the Prime Minister of Cambodia. After speaking to both Parties, Ceasefire, Peace, and Prosperity seems to be a natural. We will soon see!”
    


            Thailand's military has long been a major player in the kingdom's politics. The country has for years been dominated by a conservative establishment comprising the military, the monarchy and influential elites.
    


            Generals have seized power in 20 coups since 1932, often toppling democratic governments, according to the CIA World Factbook, and the military portrays itself as the ultimate defender of the monarchy.
    


            Thailand is a United States treaty ally, a status dating back to the signing of the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty, also known as the Manila Pact, in 1954, according to the US State Department.
    


            During the Vietnam War, Thailand hosted US Air Force assets at some air bases, including B-52 bombers, and tens of thousands Thai troops fought on the side of the US-backed South Vietnam against the communist North.
    


            Strong ties between Washington and Bangkok have endured. Thailand is classed as a major non-NATO ally by the US, giving it special benefits that have enabled it to enjoy access to decades of US support for its weapons programs.
    


            Thailand and the US Indo-Pacific Command co-host the annual Cobra Gold military exercise, which began in 1982 as joint drills with the US but has since added dozens of other participants. It's the longest-running international military exercise in the world, according to the US military.
    


            Besides Cobra Gold, Thai and US forces hold more than 60 exercises together, and more than 900 US aircraft and 40 Navy ships visit Thailand yearly, the US State Department says.
    


            Despite all that history with Washington, these days the Thai military tries to maintain a more neutral approach to military policy, increasing ties with China in the past decade.
    


            Not wanting to rely on any one country as its arms supplier, it has also developed a strong domestic weapons industry, with the help of countries such as Israel, Italy, Russia, South Korea and Sweden, the “Military Balance” report says.
    


            Cambodia's military is young in comparison to Thailand's, established in 1993 after forces of the communist government were merged with two non-communist resistance armies, according to the IISS.
    


            “Cambodia's most important international defense links are with China and Vietnam. Despite a traditional reliance on Russia for defense equipment, China has emerged as a key supplier,” the IISS says.
    


            Beijing has even developed a naval base in Cambodia. The Ream Naval Base, on the Gulf of Thailand, would be able to host Chinese aircraft carriers, according to international analysts.
    


            Cambodia and China completed the seventh edition of their annual Golden Dragon joint military exercise in May, which was touted as the largest ever and featured live-fire training scenarios.
    


            It's a relationship that's expected to reach “a new level and achieve new development” this year, according to a February report on the People's Liberation Army's English-language website.

Violence is flaring again on the Thai-Cambodian border. Why is it so contentious?



            “China and Cambodia are iron-clad friends who… always support each other. The two militaries enjoy unbreakable relations and rock-solid brotherhood,” Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Senior Col. Wu Qian told a press conference in February, when asked about possible fissures in relations.
    


            Cambodia's military needs the support.
    


            “Cambodia currently lacks the ability to design and manufacture modern equipment for its armed forces,” the IISS report says.
    


            Bolstered by years of US support, the Royal Thai Air Force is well equipped, with at least 11 modern Swedish Gripen fighter jets and dozens of older, US-made F-16 and F-5 jets, according to the IISS. Cambodia has no combat-capable air force to speak of.
    


            On the ground, Thailand has dozens of battle tanks, including 60 modern, Chinese-made VT-4 tanks, and hundreds of older, US-made tanks. Cambodia has about 200 old Chinese- and Soviet-made tanks, the “Military Balance” shows.
    


            The Thai army boasts more than 600 artillery pieces, including at least 56 powerful 155mm weapons and more than 550 105mm towed guns. Cambodia has only a dozen 155mm guns with around 400 smaller towed artillery pieces, according to IISS figures.
    


            In the air, the army has US-made Cobra attack helicopters as well as 18 US Black Hawk transports. Cambodia has only a few dozen older Soviet and Chinese transport helicopters.
    


            Hawaii-based military analyst Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center, said that while Thailand has the numerical and qualitative military advantage, Cambodia has at least one thing in its favor – the actual land along the disputed border.
    


            “Terrain favors access from Cambodian territory to the disputed area,” Schuster told CNN.
    


            And with Cambodian forces allegedly  laying landmines and booby traps in the disputed area, Thailand can be expected to rely on longer-range weaponry, he said.
    


            “The Royal Thai Air Force is superior and their special forces are superior,” Schuster said. “I think the Thais will prefer to emphasize air power and long-range firepower in the conflict.”

            A Venezuelan baseball team was denied visas into the United States and will miss this year's Senior Baseball World Series, Little League International confirmed Friday.
    


            The Cacique Mara team, from Maracaibo, Venezuela, was scheduled to participate in the tournament after winning the Latin American championship in Mexico.
    


            “The Cacique Mara Little League team from Venezuela was unfortunately unable to obtain the appropriate visas to travel to the Senior League Baseball World Series,” Little League International said in a statement, adding that it is “extremely disappointing, especially to these young athletes.”
    


            The Venezuelan team traveled to Colombia two weeks ago to apply for their visas at the U.S. embassy in Bogotá.
    


            The embassy did not immediately respond to an Associated Press request for comment.
    


            “It is a mockery on the part of Little League to keep us here in Bogotá with the hope that our children can fulfill their dreams of participating in a world championship,” the team said in a statement. “What do we do with so much injustice, what do we do with the pain that was caused to our children?”
    


            Venezuela is among a list of countries with restrictions for entering the U.S. or its territories. President Donald Trump has banned travel to the U.S. from 12 other countries, citing national security concerns.
    


‘Our fans are feeling in fear': One year out from the World Cup, Mexico supporters are avoiding matches due to ICE concerns



            Earlier in the month, the Cuban women's volleyball team was denied visas to participate in a tournament in Puerto Rico.
    


            “They told us that Venezuela is on a list because Trump says Venezuelans are a threat to the security of his state, of his country,” said Kendrick Gutiérrez, the league's president in Venezuela. “It hasn't been easy the situation; we earned the right to represent Latin America in the World Championship.”
    


            The Senior League Baseball World Series, a tournament for players aged 13-16, is played each year in Easley, South Carolina. It begins Saturday.
    


            The tournament organizers replaced the Venezuelans with the Santa Maria de Aguayo team from Tamaulipas, Mexico, the team that was a runner-up in the Latin American championship.
    


            “I think this is the first time this has happened, but it shouldn't end this way. They're going to replace us with another team because relations have been severed; it's not fair,” Gutiérrez added. “I don't understand why they put Mexico in at the last minute and left Venezuela out.”

By Murad Sadygzade, President of the Middle East Studies Center, Visiting Lecturer, HSE University (Moscow).

By Murad Sadygzade, President of the Middle East Studies Center, Visiting Lecturer, HSE University (Moscow).

As expected, the events of October 7, 2023, became a turning point after which Israel's far-right government set a course toward the final elimination of the Palestinian issue. Under the pretext of ensuring national security and responding to attacks by Hamas, the Netanyahu government launched a large-scale military campaign in Gaza. However, behind the military rhetoric lies a strategic intent to dismantle any potential Palestinian self-governance and to displace the population – a process increasingly taking the form of ethnic cleansing.

Despite the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza – tens of thousands killed, destroyed infrastructure, a blockade on humanitarian aid – the Israeli authorities continue their offensive, disregarding both international law and numerous calls for a ceasefire. The international community, including the UN and leading humanitarian organizations, has voiced strong condemnation of the ongoing events. Yet, external pressure has so far failed to produce any significant changes. Instead of moving toward resolution, the conflict is spiraling deeper into a crisis of unprecedented scale and brutality.

Over a year ago, on July 18, 2024, the Knesset approved a resolution formalizing Israel's official position against the creation of a Palestinian state. The document, passed by a majority vote, established the Israeli parliament's “principled stance” that Palestinian statehood allegedly constitutes an existential threat to the State of Israel and its citizens.

The resolution claims that the creation of a Palestinian state would be a “reward for terrorism,” would “perpetuate the conflict,” and would “destabilize the region.” Moreover, lawmakers argued, should a Palestinian state emerge, control over it would soon fall into the hands of Hamas – the radical movement governing the Gaza Strip. In this context, the new state, in the Knesset's view, would become a “terror base” operating in coordination with the “axis of evil” led by Iran, aiming to destroy Israel. Thus, the declaration not only reflects the rigid ideological stance of the current political leadership but also effectively blocks any prospects for a political resolution to the Palestinian issue.

However, neither Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor the Israeli political establishment stopped there. Following the declaration against Palestinian statehood and the assertion of the West Bank's “principled” belonging to the Jewish people, came another step deepening the course toward the de facto annexation of occupied territories. On July 23, 2025, the Knesset passed a new, even more radical, resolution. The document explicitly proclaims the intention to extend Israeli sovereignty over the entire territory of the West Bank and to initiate the legal integration of this land into Israel's administrative and legal system.

The resolution received the support of 71 lawmakers, with 13 voting against – reflecting the continued rightward shift of the Israeli parliament and its consolidation around the idea of “Greater Israel.” The text states that “in the face of global antisemitism, military threats, and constant terror, Judea and Samaria cannot remain under temporary status,” and that “historical justice and security demand the official recognition of these territories as part of sovereign Israel.” The resolution was spearheaded by the same forces behind previous ones – members of Likud, the Religious Zionist Party, and Otzma Yehudit.

Although the new resolution, like its predecessors, does not formally entail immediate legislative consequences, it has become a significant signal: the annexation of the West Bank is no longer seen as a hypothetical possibility but is being advanced as a strategic objective. In practice, this means the continued expansion of Jewish settlements, the tightening of the military regime, and the displacement of the Palestinian population – despite international protests and systematic violations of international law, including the Geneva Convention.

Thus, Israel's political course has definitively shifted from a policy of “conflict containment” to the unilateral rewriting of the region's geopolitical reality.

In addition to active domestic measures aimed at legally and administratively cementing Israeli control over the occupied territories, Israel is increasingly deploying military-political tools against the so-called “Axis of Resistance” – an alliance of anti-Western and anti-Israeli forces led by Iran. In this context, Israel has adopted a comprehensive strategy to weaken the key players in this bloc, acting both directly and through allies – foremost among them, the United States.

Special focus was placed on Lebanon, where Israel achieved a significant success in its campaign against the Shiite movement Hezbollah. In September 2024, a high-precision operation resulted in the elimination of the group's long-standing leader, Hassan Nasrallah. According to Israeli and Western intelligence, the strike was carried out by a drone as part of a reconnaissance-sabotage mission in southern Lebanon. His death dealt a heavy blow to the moral and organizational core of the movement, which for decades symbolized resistance to Israeli expansion. Amid the chaos within Hezbollah following Nasrallah's elimination, Israel intensified its missile and air strikes on weapons depots, command posts, and infrastructure throughout southern Lebanon.

In parallel, through the American diplomatic apparatus, Israel has been lobbying for an initiative to partially or fully disarm Hezbollah, appealing to Lebanon's new pro-Western government formed in early 2025. The strategy is based on the assumption that international support and economic pressure will force Beirut to withdraw backing for the Shiite armed group.

Another direction of Israel's strategy is the Republic of Yemen, where systematic strikes have been carried out against positions of the Ansar Allah movement (the Houthis), which maintains close ties with Tehran. The Israeli Air Force conducted a series of targeted attacks on logistical routes and ballistic missile depots, especially in areas used by the Houthis for attacks on ships in the Red Sea. These actions were coordinated with operations by coalition forces led by the US and the United Kingdom, aimed at securing maritime navigation and limiting Iran's ability to project power through its proxies.

Syria remains another strategic priority. Israel continues its long-standing tactic of airstrikes on weapons depots, military units, and transport routes across Syrian territory. However, in recent months, this activity has been complemented by a more subtle approach: West Jerusalem is quietly supporting separatist movements within the country – primarily Druze and Kurdish groups. The creation of autonomous structures in these regions, aligned with the West or at least hostile to Damascus and Ankara, is seen as a way to further erode Syrian sovereignty and deprive Iran and Türkiye of their footholds in the Levant.

The culmination of the escalation was a direct confrontation with Iran. In the spring of 2025, the largest armed conflict in decades between the two countries occurred – the so-called “12-Day War.” Following a series of mutual attacks, including a massive Iranian missile strike on Israeli military sites in the Negev and a retaliatory Israeli campaign targeting Iranian air defense systems, nuclear facilities, and command centers, the conflict was halted through US and Qatari mediation. Nonetheless, it made clear that Israel is prepared for an open military scenario in pursuit of its strategic objective – the dismantling of Iran's regional network of influence. In this way, Israel is acting not only in the name of national defense but also as the initiator of a sweeping transformation of the Middle East power balance.

It is worth noting that the actions of the Israeli leadership, especially in recent months, have not always found full approval within Donald Trump's administration. Despite a long-standing alliance and ideological proximity, Prime Minister Netanyahu has increasingly placed Washington in an awkward position. Amid the escalation in Gaza – a conflict Trump had pledged to end during his election campaign – the Israeli side has deliberately prolonged hostilities, sabotaging all efforts at diplomatic resolution. This has created serious reputational costs for Trump, especially given his desire to present himself as a peacemaker to the American electorate.

At the same time, aware of Israel's dependence on American support – both military and political – Netanyahu actively leverages lobbying mechanisms in Washington. Through pro-Israel advocacy groups and allies within Trump's circle, he has been able to steer the White House toward decisions that serve his interests. A vivid example was the events of the 12-Day War with Iran, during which, despite internal disagreements within the US administration, Washington conducted airstrikes on Iranian nuclear infrastructure. This marked a critical turning point, effectively dragging Washington into direct military confrontation with Tehran – in defiance of the more cautious stance held by parts of the American strategic community.

In addition, Israeli authorities have advanced another controversial initiative, which has already sparked backlash even within the US: the idea of relocating the Palestinian population from Gaza and transforming the coastal strip into a tourism and infrastructure project known as the “Gaza Riviera.” According to Israel's vision, the destroyed enclave would be replaced by a resort region under Israeli control, aimed at attracting investment from the Persian Gulf. 

Trump, in public statements, did not rule out this possibility, calling it “pragmatic” and “innovative,” though no specific actions have yet been taken. Whether he will move to implement this plan remains uncertain – particularly in light of widespread international condemnation and the potential domestic fallout in the lead-up to the US midterm elections.

The relationship between Israel and the US is increasingly marked by complexity and asymmetry: West Jerusalem continues to pursue its goals, even at the risk of straining ties with its closest ally, while Washington, despite growing fatigue with the conflict, remains reluctant to openly confront Netanyahu.

Israeli authorities are systematically and deliberately pursuing the final elimination of the Palestinian issue while simultaneously seeking to weaken all regional competitors – from Iran and Türkiye to various militant groups, including Hezbollah and the Houthis. Military force, diplomatic pressure, lobbying, and propaganda are all employed as part of a comprehensive strategy aimed at the full occupation of Palestinian territories and consolidation of control over the West Bank and Gaza. Despite international condemnation, mass destruction, a humanitarian catastrophe, and violations of international law, Israel's leadership continues to push forward with its long-term objective – to establish Israel as the unchallenged regional power in the Middle East.

However, the implementation of this strategy remains uncertain. First, there is no consensus among Western capitals – including Washington – on the Palestinian issue: parts of the political establishment advocate a restrained approach and the preservation of the two-state solution.

Second, Israel's increasingly aggressive actions are fueling growing resentment among Arab states, intensifying confrontations with Iran and Türkiye, and pushing the region toward large-scale escalation.

Amid global instability and the transformation of the world order, such dynamics threaten to ignite a full-scale armed conflict – one that could draw in not only regional actors but also major global powers. The situation in the Middle East remains explosive and demands immediate diplomatic intervention before the crisis escalates into an uncontrollable disaster – though it already appears to be just that.

Moscow and Kiev have agreed for Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet with Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky, according to Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan. His remarks came shortly after the latest round of bilateral negotiations facilitated by Ankara.

The third round of direct peace talks took place on Wednesday in Istanbul. While no ceasefire was reached, the parties made some progress on humanitarian issues, including agreements on the further exchange of prisoners of war and civilians.

“During the meeting, leaders discussed the conditions under which they might come together,” Fidan told Turkish broadcaster NTV on Friday, noting that “a summit between the leaders in Türkiye was agreed upon in principle.”

Earlier in the week, Fidan described the Istanbul talks as another step toward ending the conflict, emphasizing that “every new achievement brings the sides one step closer to peace.”

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed that a potential meeting between Putin and Zelensky is being considered, but stressed that it should only take place at the final stage of peace negotiations. He added that such a summit is “unlikely” to happen within a month.

Russia maintains that it is open to a diplomatic solution, but only one that addresses what it calls the “root causes” of the war and Moscow's security concerns.

Zelensky has long called for a personal meeting with Putin. Ukraine's negotiators reiterated the proposal in Istanbul this week, saying that a one-on-one summit was a key step toward ending the fighting. US President Donald Trump has also voiced support for direct talks between the two leaders as part of a broader push to resolve the conflict. Moscow has never ruled out the possibility, but insists that the necessary groundwork must first be established.

Russia has questioned Zelensky's legitimacy, citing the expiration of his five-year term in May 2024. Zelensky has refused to hold new elections, citing martial law. Russian officials argue that any agreements signed under his authority could potentially be contested.

The Kremlin has also demanded that Ukraine lift martial law and hold elections within 100 days as a condition for any long-term ceasefire.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has suffered a major blow in terms of public support over the past month, with 56% of people disapproving of his work, a survey conducted by INSA institute shows. Less than a third of respondents said they are still satisfied with his leadership.

In early June, the level of support for Merz stood at 36%, with 45% of Germans critical of his performance, according to the German tabloid Bild, which commissioned the poll. The governing coalition, which includes Merz's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Social Democrats, has also taken a beating, according to the poll.

Almost 60% of Germans are not satisfied with the coalition's work, up from just 44% in early June, the data suggests. The two parties would no longer be able to form a majority government if elections were held this weekend, with the CDU getting 27% of the vote and the Social Democrats gaining 15%, according to INSA.

Germany's most popular opposition party – the right-wing Alterative for Germany (AfD) – is polling just three percentage points behind the CDU, the poll suggested.

Since taking office in May, Merz has adopted a hardline foreign policy stance towards Russia. Berlin – one of Kiev's largest backers – has pledged to provide €5 billion ($5.6 billion) to finance long-range weapons production in Ukraine. The chancellor also did not rule out providing long-range missiles capable of striking Moscow. Merz declared that diplomatic options in the Ukraine conflict were “exhausted” earlier this month.

The chancellor's statements prompted Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to accuse him of choosing escalation instead of diplomacy.

The federal government's spending priorities have sparked criticism at home. “Nobody understands that anymore,” AfD co-chair Alice Weidel said this week, referring to Berlin's decision to funnel taxpayers' money into weapons for Kiev while leaving domestic needs being unmet.

BUDAPEST, July 26. /TASS/. The threat of a third world war keeps growing, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said, adding that the international community should do everything it can to prevent it.

""Perhaps the most important question now is whether there will be a third world war, and the answer is that the likelihood of a world war is constantly increasing,"" he said in an address broadcast by the M1 TV channel.

As evidence, Orban cited the results of polls in six major countries, whose citizens consider the threat of a new world war to be quite real. The opinion that ""in 5-10 years a third world war will break out is held by 55% of the French, 50% of the Spanish, 46% of the Italians, 45% of the Americans, 41% of the British, and 41% of the Germans,"" the premier added."" ""The whole world feels the cold wind of war,"" he noted.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, July 26. /TASS/. It can no longer be denied that a default has occurred in Ukraine, Viktor Medvedchuk, former leader of Ukraine's banned Opposition Platform - For Life party who now heads the Another Ukraine movement, said in an interview with TASS.

""After Kiev failed to make loan payments on June 2, 2025, the S&P international agency immediately lowered its issue rating on Ukraine's GDP-linked securities to D (default) from CC (currently highly vulnerable). Now, there is not a single Western expert in economy and investment denying an actual default in Ukraine,"" the politician pointed out.

""Ukraine's official announcement of a default would not only mean that the country can no longer pay its debts but also that it is unable to fight,"" Medvedchuk noted. According to him, this is the reason why ""a large share of the Western political elite is much interested in pretending that there is no default in Ukraine."".","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

State authorities say suspect in custody and investigation under way into stabbing at  Traverse City store

Authorities in Michigan are investigating after multiple people were stabbed at a Walmart in Traverse City, police said on Saturday.

The Michigan state police said in a social media post that a suspect is in custody and the local sheriff's office is investigating the incident. The agency asked that people avoid the area while the investigation is ongoing.

A Walmart corporate spokesperson, Joe Pennington, said by email that the company was “working with police and defer questions to them right now”.

Lt Michelle Robinson, the public information officer for the Michigan state police's sixth district, confirmed to the Detroit News that a person was taken into police custody but could not give details on the number of people stabbed.

Munson Healthcare, a medical center in Traverse City, posted on social media saying 11 people were being treated at that hospital. The hospital requested patience and understanding from the public as “our emergency department is currently experiencing a higher-than-usual volume of patients”.

“Our thoughts are with all those affected by this event, and we are grateful to the first responders and law enforcement for their swift action,” the post read.

Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer posted on social media that she was aware of the incident and in touch with law enforcement. She wrote: “Our thoughts are with the victims and the community reeling from this brutal act of violence. I am grateful to the first responders for their swift response to apprehend the suspect.”

Traverse City is about 255 miles (410km) north-west of Detroit.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Venezuelans back home under Maduro-Trump deal tell of isolation, beatings and dirty water – ‘a living nightmare'  

Venezuelans that the Trump administration expelled to El Salvador's most notorious megaprison endured “state-sanctioned torture”, lawyers for some of the men have said, as more stories emerge about the horrors they faced during capacity.

When José Manuel Ramos Bastidas – one of 252 Venezuelan men that the US sent to El Salvador's most notorious mega-prison – finally made it back home to El Tocuyo on Tuesday, the first thing he did was stretch his arms around his family.

His wife, son and mother were wearing the bright blue shirts they had printed with a photo of him, posed in a yellow and black moto jacket and camo-print jeans. It was the first time they had hugged him since he left Venezuela last year. And it was the first time they could be sure – truly sure – that he was alive and well since he disappeared into the Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo (Cecot) in March.

“We have been waiting for this moment for months, and I feel like I can finally breathe,” said Roynerliz Rodríguez, Ramos Bastidas's partner. “These last months have been a living nightmare, not knowing anything about José Manuel and only imagining what he must be suffering. I am happy he is free from Cecot, but I also know that we will never be free of the shadow of this experience. There must be justice for all those who suffered this torture.”

The Venezuelan deportees were repatriated last week following a deal between the US and Venezuelan governments. Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan president, negotiated a prisoner swap that released 10 American citizens in his custody and dozens of Venezuelan political prisoners in exchange for the release of his citizens from Cecot.

This week, after undergoing medical and background checks, they are finally reuniting with their families. Their testimonies of what they experienced inside Cecot are providing the first, most detailed pictures of the conditions inside Cecot, a mega-prison that human rights groups say is designed to disappear people.

Ramos Bastidas and other US deportees were told that they were condemned to spend 30 to 90 years in Cecot unless the US president ordered otherwise, he told his lawyers. They were shot with rubber bullets on repeated occasions – including on Friday, during their last day of detention.

In interviews with the media and in testimony provided to their lawyers, other detainees described lengthy beatings and humiliation by guards. After some detainees tried to break the locks on their cell, prisoners were beaten for six consecutive days, the Atlantic reports. Male guards reportedly brought in female colleagues, who beat the naked prisoners and recorded videos.

Edicson David Quintero Chacón, a US deportee, said that he was placed in isolation for stretches of time, during which he thought he would die, his lawyer told the Guardian. Quintero Chacón, who has scars from daily beatings, also said that he and other inmates were only provided soap and an opportunity to bathe on days when visitors were touring the prison – forcing them to choose between hygiene and public humiliation.

Food was limited, and the drinking water was dirty, Quintero Chacón and other detainees have said. Lights were on all night, so detainees could never fully rest. “And the guards would also come in at night and beat them at night,” said his lawyer Stephanie M Alvarez-Jones, the south-east regional attorney at the National Immigration Project.

In a filing asking for a dismissal of her months-long petition on behalf of her clients' release, Alvarez-Jones wrote: “He will likely carry the psychological impact of this torture his whole life. The courts must never look away when those who wield the power of the US government, at the highest levels, engage in such state-sanctioned violence.”

Ramos Bastidas has never been convicted of any crimes in the US (or in any country). In fact, he had never really set foot in the US as a free man.

In El Tocuyo, in the Venezuelan state of Lara, and had been working since he was a teenager to support his family. Last year, he decided to leave his country – which has yet to recover from an economic collapse – to seek better income, so he could pay for medical care for his infant with severe asthma.

In March 2024, he arrived at the US-Mexico border and presented himself at a port of entry. He made an appointment using the now-defunct CBP One phone application to apply for asylum – but immigration officials and a judge determined that he did not qualify.

But Customs and Border Protection agents had flagged Ramos Bastidas as a possible member of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, based on an unsubstantiated report from Panamanian officials and his tattoos. So they transferred him to a detention facility, where he was to remain until he could be deported.

Despite agreeing to return to Venezuela, he remained for months in detention. “I think what is particularly enraging for José is that he had accepted his deportation,” said Alvarez-Jones. “He was asking for his deportation for a long time, and he just wanted to go back home.”

In December, Venezuela wasn't accepting deportees – so Ramos Bastidas asked if he could be released and make his own way home. A month later, Donald Trump was sworn in as president. Everything changed.

Ramos Bastidas began to see other Venezuelans were being sent to the military base in Guantánamo Bay in Cuba – and he feared the same would happen to him. On 14 March, he shared with his family that maybe he would be able to come back to Venezuela after all, after officials began prepping him for deportation.

The next day, he was flown to Cecot.

“They could have deported him to Venezuela,” Alvarez-Jones. “Instead, the US government made a determination to send him to be tortured in Cecot.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Animosity between former friends and political patriarchs Hun Sen and Thaksin Shinawatra is exacerbating clashes

The dispute over Thailand and Cambodia's contested border, which dates back more than a century to disagreements over colonial-era maps, has broken into conflict before. But the most recent clashes, which erupted on Thursday, have been fuelled by another factor: a bitter feud between two powerful political patriarchs.

Hun Sen, 72, and Thaksin Shinawatra, 76, former leaders of Cambodia and Thailand, were once such close friends they reportedly called one another brothers. Hun Sen has, over the years, supported Thaksin's family during their long-running power struggle with Thailand's military. Thaksin and his sister Yingluck stayed at Hun Sen's home after they were ousted from power, while Hun Sen appointed Thaksin an economic adviser to the Cambodian government. Thaksin frequently visited Cambodia, and Hun Sen was the first foreign guest to see the former Thai leader after he returned home after more than 15 years in self-imposed exile.

But relations have broken down spectacularly over recent months. The exact reasons for their feud are unclear, but analysts say it has created an additional layer of volatility that is exacerbating deadly clashes on the neighbouring countries' border.

Hun Sen and Thaksin are no longer in office in their respective countries, but both remain powerful. Hun Sen ruled for almost 40 years until 2003, when his eldest son Hun Manet became prime minister after running virtually uncontested in a sham election. Thaksin's daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra became prime minister last year.

The extent of their falling out became clear last month, when Hun Sen leaked a recording of a phone conversation between himself and Paetongtarn.
  In the call, which was about the border dispute, Paetongtarn called Hun Sen “uncle” and told him if there was anything he wanted, she would “take care of it”. She also made disparaging comments about a senior Thai military commander.

The leaked recording caused uproar in Thailand. Critics accused her of kowtowing to Cambodia, putting her family connections before the country's national interests. She was suspended from office by the constitutional court in July pending an investigation into ethical violations.

It's not clear why Hun Sen chose to turn on his former friends. He has accused Thaksin of betrayal and threatened to reveal further sensitive information about the Shinawatras. “I never imagined someone so close could act this way,” Thaksin said later, declaring their friendship over.

Some analysts say Hun Sen may be trying to whip up nationalism domestically to increase support for his son, Hun Manet.

Others suggest Hun Sen has been angered by Thailand's efforts to crack down on so-called “scam compounds” where trafficked workers are held and forced to target people around the world with online scams. This form of lucrative criminal activity has proliferated in the region over recent years, especially in Cambodia.

“The popular narrative in Thailand is that the two men may have had some kind of personal dealings behind the scenes that did not go according to plan and the fallout has spilled over into the realm of national interest,” said Tita Sanglee, associate fellow with ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.

Whatever his motivations, Hun Sen has succeeded in damaging Thaksin's position, exploiting divisions between his family and the military, and creating a power vacuum in Thailand.

Hun Sen, meanwhile, “holds near absolute control in Cambodia”, adds Tita. He has stamped out virtually all opposition voices and independent media. “When he chooses to take a strong stance, militarily or politically, it has immediate and direct consequences.”

On Thursday night, Thaksin said he had thanked countries that had offered to mediate the border dispute, but would like to wait, adding: “We need to let the Thai military do their job, and first teach this cunning Hun Sen a lesson.”

Given Thaksin's weakened position, he may not have a choice but to let the military take the lead.

Last week Thailand downgraded it diplomatic relations with Cambodia, recalling its ambassador, and saying it would expel the country's envoy in Bangkok.

Thaksin has denied the families' feud was the cause of the clashes. However awkward questions about his friend turned foe are likely to continue.

As he visited communities sheltering from the conflict in Ubon Ratchathani, in northeastern Thailand, a woman confronted him: “You're Hun Sen's friend, aren't you? Is he your friend? Why do you allow Cambodia to shoot Thai people?”
 Solving territorial disagreements is difficult in any context, said Pavin Chachavalpongpun, professor at the Center for Southeast Asian Studies at Kyoto University. “No country would like to sacrifice any inch of sovereignty,” he said. But the personal conflict between Hun Sen and Thaksin has, he added, made their countries' dispute even more unpredictable.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Taiwan's Chou Tien-chen yesterday exited in the semi-finals at the China Open in Changzhou, beaten by the world's No. 2 player in men's singles badminton.

Chou, who is ranked No. 6 in the world, was eliminated 21-13, 22-20 by Shi Yuqi of China, despite the Taiwanese claiming healthy leads in both games.

The 35-year-old Chou, who on Friday beat world No. 1 Kunlavut Vitidsarn of Thailand at the Olympic Sports Center Gymnasium in the quarter-finals, shot to a 6-2 lead in game 1, but his Chinese opponent eroded the advantage and took the lead at 12-11. From there, Shi conceded only two further points in the game.

In game 2, Chou did not concede ground so lightly. He was up 8-4, 11-8 and 15-12, with each lead a response to Shi having leveled the scores.

However, from 15-12 Shi stormed to an 18-15 lead before wrapping up the match in 45 minutes to take his head-to-head record against Chou to 13-5.

Yankees star Aaron Judge was the last player to homer in five consecutive games, accomplishing that feat last year.
Ohtani, who leads the National League with 37 home runs, homered in the first inning off Minnesota Twins starter Chris Paddack. He hit a slow curveball 134m to center. He carried the bat midway down the first-base line and then did a bat flip.
He did not hit a home run later in the game with the Dodgers trailing, but his presence was felt. With two outs                                    



                                                                                Ben O'Connor won Thursday's monster Alpine stage to the ski resort of Courchevel as three-time Tour de France champion Tadej Pogacar responded to attacks from Jonas Vingegaard and dropped him to cement his grip on the yellow jersey.
With just three stages left before the race ends in Paris, Pogacar looks poised to retain his title, with a comfortable lead of more than 4 minutes over Vingegaard, a two-time champion.
Stage 18 featured three extremely difficult ascents, including the 26.4km climb of the Col de La Loze to the finish. At 2,304m, La Loze is the highest summit in this year's Tour.

It was former world No. 2 Chou's eighth win in 14 matches against Prannoy, who had earlier this week lamented the age divide between him and up-and-comers, although he is only two years younger than 35-year-old Chou.
The Taiwanese, who is seeded sixth at the tournament, rebounded from a close 21-18 loss in game 1 on Court 2 at the Olympic Sports Center Gymnasium.
He bounced back to take the next games 21-15, 21-8 and set up a tough quarter-final

Fairchild was designated for assignment by the Braves on Monday after hitting .216/.273/.333 in 28 games for Atlanta, with most of his work coming as a pinch runner or defensive replacement. He joins Tampa Bay as a versatile fourth outfielder option.
To make room for Fairchild on the 40-man roster, the Rays transferred relief pitcher Manuel Rodriguez (forearm strain) from the 15-day injured list to the 60-day                                    ","{'href': 'https://www.taipeitimes.com', 'title': 'Taipei Times'}","world"

Russia will reinforce its Black Sea Fleet with marine robotic systems, warships, and additional aircraft, Nikolai Patrushev, the head of Russia's Maritime Collegium, said in an interview with the state-run RIA Novosti published on July 25. 

""In the coming years, the Black Sea sailors will be further strengthened — with the arrival of new frigates, corvettes, aviation, marine robotic complexes,"" Patrushev said. 

The Black Sea Fleet, headquartered in Sevastopol since Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, has suffered significant losses during the war against Ukraine. 

Ukrainian missile and drone strikes have forced the Kremlin to relocate part of the fleet away from occupied Crimea, reducing its operational presence in the region.

Despite these setbacks, Patrushev emphasized the fleet's strategic importance, claiming it remains critical for countering NATO and continuing military operations against Ukraine.

Ukraine has destroyed or disabled at least 29 Russian vessels, according to the Ukrainian General Staff. Among the most notable losses are the fleet's flagship, the Moskva, sunk in April 2022, the Caesar Kunikov and Sergei Kotov, along with numerous smaller landing crafts.

In June, Russian President Vladimir Putin approved a new naval doctrine aimed at restoring Russia's status as a global maritime power.

Patrushev, 74, a longtime ally of Putin and often described as the architect of Russia's war against Ukraine, has held influential positions in Russia's security apparatus for decades. 

He previously served as the secretary of the Security Council and was reportedly a key advocate for launching the full-scale invasion in 2022.

Russia's navy remains the third most powerful in the world, according to public assessments, but the full-scale war has exposed vulnerabilities in its Black Sea operations, where Ukraine has managed to push back one of the Kremlin's most prized military assets.

Ukrainian forces have pushed back Russian troops in Sumy Oblast, disrupting Moscow's attempts to expand its foothold in the region, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on July 26.

Russia opened a new front in Sumy Oblast in early June, capturing around a dozen border villages. The push followed Russian President Vladimir Putin's May declaration that Moscow aimed to create a ""security buffer zone"" along Ukraine's northeastern border. 

""Although this region remains one of the priority areas for the enemy, our forces consistently block Russian attempts to advance deeper into Sumy Oblast from the border,"" Zelensky wrote following a report from Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi.

""I thanked the Commander-in-Chief for managing to thwart the Russian plan for the Sumy region. Our active actions in Sumy Oblast continue, and I am grateful to each unit that is gradually pushing the Russian forces out.""

The president's statement came after the battlefield tracking group DeepState reported on July 25 that Ukrainian forces had liberated the village of Kindrativka near the Russian border.

Zelensky warned in May that a 50,000-strong Russian force was massing near the oblast. Syrskyi said last month that Ukraine had managed to pin down this grouping and halt its progress, describing the Russian advance as ""faltering.""

Sumy Oblast has been a key target for Russian forces throughout the full-scale invasion due to its location on the northeastern frontier. It continues to face near-daily strikes, but Ukrainian forces have maintained control over most of the region.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko is again using his country's territory to funnel illegal migrants from Africa, the Middle East, and Afghanistan toward the European Union, Ukraine's Foreign Intelligence Service said on July 26. 

According to the agency, Lukashenko is facilitating transit primarily to Poland, with some migrants arriving from Libya directly or through Russia — pointing to coordinated efforts between Minsk and Moscow.

This mirrors tactics used in 2021, when Belarus orchestrated mass migrant crossings into EU states in what Brussels condemned as a form of hybrid warfare. The effort was widely seen as an attempt to blackmail the bloc into easing sanctions on Lukashenko's regime.

""This blackmail did not work,"" Ukraine's intelligence service said, noting that the response instead intensified Belarus' diplomatic isolation.

While Lukashenko reportedly profits from the migrant flows, he has so far avoided full-scale escalation, likely in an effort to preserve his few remaining political ties in Europe. 

Hungary, which has taken a hard line against illegal migration, has remained one of the few EU states maintaining dialogue with Minsk.

""Lukashenko, despite his reputation as a satellite of Russia's dictator Vladimir Putin, retains autonomy in matters of tactics — and once again demonstrates a willingness to use it to exert political pressure on the West,"" the agency said.

Poland, one of the EU's front-line states, has long accused Belarus and Russia of waging a hybrid war by deliberately directing migrants toward its borders. 

Warsaw reported stopping 26,000 illegal crossing attempts in 2024 alone. One soldier was killed and 63 others injured in related border clashes.

Polish officials have pointed to a growing number of migrants carrying Russian visas, linking the wave directly to the Kremlin's broader confrontation with the West.

Lukashenko has ruled Belarus since 1994 and remains a key ally of the Kremlin. His regime has allowed Russian troops and equipment to use Belarusian territory to attack Ukraine at the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022.

For years the U.S. stock market sucked the air out of the world's markets. At its peak, it accounted for more than half of the world's publicly-traded capital. But now, money has begun returning home.ANGELA WEISS/AFP/Getty Images

John Rapley is a contributing columnist for The Globe and Mail. He is an author and academic whose books include Why Empires Fall and Twilight of the Money Gods.

Stock markets are probing fresh heights. Among the G7 economies, only Italy's isn't in record territory and even Japan, which looked to have entered terminal decline after its 1990 crash, is now back within touching distance of those long-ago highs. House prices as well are near their all-time highs in most places, slightly off their recent peaks but still far above where they ever were before. And that's nothing compared with crypto and gold – bitcoin is up more than a quarter this year, gold nearly a third.

In short, we're getting richer by the day. Which is kind of strange, because our economies are barely moving. Of the major economies, only the United States has shown any significant expansion recently and even that is now slowing rapidly. Reflecting this new deceleration, the corporate-earnings season now under way in the United States is turning out to be a dud, with profit growth coming in well below the rate of share-price increases. 

In short, the strength of market rallies doesn't reflect what's happening in economies, which are weak and getting weaker. So what's going on?

Some of it is rebalancing. Talk of all-time highs in the U.S. stock market cloud the reality – the U.S. is the laggard, it's stock market up a mere 5 per cent since President Donald Trump took office and 8 per cent for the year, a far cry from Germany's 22 per cent or Hong Kong's 28 per cent. Currency effects make the discrepancy even more dramatic, leaving the U.S. market down in euro and peso terms, and pretty much flat in Canadian dollars.

Lofty U.S. stock valuations bank on tech-heavy market's earnings strength

For years the U.S. stock market sucked the air out of the world's markets. At its peak, it accounted for more than half of the world's publicly traded capital, the Magnificent Seven tech stocks alone having a combined value bigger than any other stock market on the planet. But now, money has begun returning home. That explains the weakening of the dollar. Given how much smaller than the U.S. these markets are, flows of this scale have an outsized impact on prices. As a result, the laggards of the past decade, such as Spain, Hong Kong, South Africa and Britain, have become winners, with a small share of repatriated investment making for big rallies.

This rebalancing was always bound to happen at some point, but Mr. Trump's policies are accelerating it. Though presenting the trade “deals” he's now rolling out as wins, because other countries have to “pay” higher tariffs than the U.S., it's an odd victory when your consumers must pay more for their goods than foreigners. After Mr. Trump announced his trade deal with Japan this week, Toyota's share price shot up 15 per cent, but Ford's barely budged. That's because the price of a Toyota car will increase by 15 per cent, but Ford's will probably rise more, since the company must pay tariffs on all its inputs.

The same is happening in bond markets, where the spread between U.S. government bonds and those of other countries, especially emerging markets, is narrowing. As the U.S. looks less investable, other countries lure capital back away from it.

To this reallocation of investment one can add the massive amount of stimulus now entering the global pipeline – the tax cuts in Mr. Trump's Big Beautiful Bill, Germany's big stimulus program, NATO's rearmament, Japan's fiscal loosening: There's a lot of bond issuance coming, which will pump money into the world economy. The monetary tightening that had followed the 2021-22 inflation spike has now given way to an increase in global money supply that's running at an annual rate of more than 7 per cent.

Opinion: The triple contradiction of Trumponomics could crash the world economy

But what's good for markets isn't necessarily good for the economy. In the U.S., first-time homebuyers are spending a higher share of their income on mortgage payments today than they were before the 2008 crash, leaving less to spend or invest on other things, while squeezing future demand. The same is happening in Canada, and as we know one consequence of the rising cost of living is that voters are demanding a reduction in immigration. If voters don't always favour the harsh measures being taken against immigrants in the U.S., nonetheless virtually all Western countries are starting to clamp down on inflows. That is cutting off one of the few remaining sources of growth in Western economies, namely the rise in labour supply.

Sooner or later, in short, markets will realign with the economy. Unless the latter picks up, the former are sure to fall. At the moment, a slowdown looks the more likely scenario. Whatever stimulus effects come from government's fiscal largesse, the impact of tariffs and slow growth in the labour market owing to immigration cutbacks will drag down growth. Investors are still pricing shares as if the good days will keep rolling. But this fall may bring a chill to markets.

Andy Filipowich is a high school teacher by day, but a prolific Wikipedia editor by night.Galit Rodan/The Globe and Mail

The bronze bust of William Lyon Mackenzie sits on a tall plinth tucked away in Toronto's Queen's Park. He has a defiant expression, befitting the rebel leader against Upper Canada, and a swooping hairdo that looks like a bird perched atop his head. 

Earlier this summer, Andy Filipowich was here to take in the statue. He's a high school teacher by day, but a prolific Wikipedia editor by night. 

The 36-year-old is one of the editors of Mackenzie's Wikipedia page, whose meticulous writing and citing led the article to be featured on the website's front page – arguably one of the highest distinctions for a Wikipedia editor. That day, more than 25,000 people read the article.

“You can only stumble upon it if you're physically in the space,” Mr. Filipowich says about the statue. “But in the online world, anyone can stumble on any information.”

Since Wikipedia was founded nearly a quarter of a century ago, fortified by co-founder Jimmy Wales's goal to “help the internet not suck,” it has consistently ranked as one of the top 10 most visited websites worldwide. 

Free of ads and profit-seeking corporate overlords, and maintained by dedicated volunteers, Wikipedia is arguably one of the last best places on the internet.

In any given month, Wikipedia gets more than four billion page views globally, but only a tiny sliver of those visitors will actually make edits to the website. An army of volunteers writes and edits article pages, removes vandalism and misinformation, and adds citations. The internet runs on these kinds of quiet acts of online altruism: the unsung heroes who upload fresh menus on Google, moderate Reddit forums, or post honest product reviews on Amazon amid the flood of fake ones. 

Over the past two decades, Wikipedia has faced various threats, including censorship from hostile governments and nefarious sock puppet accounts hijacking articles. But every time, the website has fought back and adapted to the changing tides of the internet. Now, however, it faces an existential threat. Editors are fearful that as more people use AI chatbots such as ChatGPT or Gemini to find information, they won't need Wikipedia. 

For Mr. Filipowich, and the more than hundred thousand active editors, the survival of Wikipedia has never been more important. 

Andy Filipowich's first big project was overhauling William Lyon Mackenzie's Wikipedia page.Galit Rodan/The Globe and Mail

A Canadian history buff, Mr. Filipowich has been an active editor since 2020. While sitting at home during COVID lockdown, he clicked the “random article” button on Wikipedia's main page and landed on a gas explosion in Toronto's Etobicoke neighbourhood in the early 2000s. The article didn't have much information, so he started adding new details. He caught the bug, as he describes it, and kept editing other Wikipedia articles. 

Mr. Filipowich's first big project was overhauling Mackenzie's page to bring it up to “featured article” status, which Wikipedia considers the best work on the site and only grants to 0.1 per cent of all articles. For a year, he read multiple biographies, dug through newspaper archives and made tweaks based on feedback from other editors. 

Hannah Clover, a 22-year-old from the Niagara region in Ontario, started editing Wikipedia when she was in high school. At 16, she created the page for Canadian journalist and archivist Katherine Hughes, which was featured on Wikipedia's front page in the “Did you know” section. “I was completely ecstatic the whole day,” says Ms. Clover. “I kept refreshing the main page and going, ‘I wrote that one sentence!'”

Earlier this year, she wrote Wikipedia's first article ever on ketchup chips, excavating every mention she could find of the food in newspaper archives and reading a book about the history of Canadian snacks. She writes book plot summaries, too, as well as descriptions of landmarks in the Niagara region. When she discovered the Niagara Falls Public Library didn't have a photo on its article page, she hiked around the city, snapping shots of every branch to add to the website's licence-free media archive. Last year, Ms. Clover was named “Wikimedian of the year,” an annual award that honours an editor's contributions. 

How Wikipedia became one of the greatest achievements of the modern age

For Ms. Clover, part of her motivation is the community she's built. She's made a lot of friends on Wikipedia, finding kinship with fellow nerds who are happy to geek out about the credibility of sources and discuss ways to improve the website. 

“A big part of what makes me stay is the community, because people get me. It's like a bunch of bookworms everywhere,” she says. 

That sense of community is also what keeps Enoch Leung, 27, volunteering with Wikipedia. He started editing when he was 12, and over the next couple years, began working on some of the maintenance aspects of Wikipedia, such as monitoring new edits for vandalism. He's attended meetups with other Toronto-based editors, including recently visiting the Toronto Islands to take photos for Wikimedia Commons. 

“In a world where the internet feels increasingly dystopian as algorithms dictate what we see and think … it's refreshing to be part of a website that isn't any of that – and perhaps a little intimidating too,” says Mr. Leung. 

Wikipedia is not without its flaws. There's a stark gender gap among its editors – about 80 per cent are men – and in its content too, with women accounting for only 20 per cent of biographical entries. Wikipedia has also been accused of both being too conservative and too progressive. Earlier this year, Elon Musk said it's “an extension of legacy media propaganda” and called for the website to be “defunded.”

But the biggest concern right now is AI chatbots. 

People are increasingly using chatbots to seek out information they would have once found on Wikipedia. (Ironically the website is one of the most widely used data sources for AI training models owing to its open licence.) Some editors and researchers worry fewer people will visit the website directly. And that means fewer opportunities to attract potential new editors – the lifeblood of the platform. 

Opinion: Elon Musk's hate for Wikipedia reveals his true views on free speech

“Wikipedia is this economic anomaly. In many ways, it's sort of magical that people will just volunteer without explicit economic incentives to create artifacts that are meant to share knowledge with everyone in the world,” says Nicholas Vincent, an assistant professor at Simon Fraser University who has studied how Wikipedia helps support Google searches. “And so fundamentally anything that threatens to cut off traffic to the actual Wikipedia platform threatens all those things.” 

Mr. Filipowich, the high school teacher, is concerned that Wikipedia could become a relic of the past if overall readership declines. But he's also hopeful that Wikipedia can find ways to use AI to grow as a site, such as using it to translate articles into other languages. It may just take time to figure out what those best-use cases are. 

“I remember going through school and Wikipedia being the new big scary thing in education,” Mr. Filipowich says. “AI has become the new form of that, and I just think it's because we don't quite know how to use it yet.” 

Dr. Vincent says there are ways in which tech companies like OpenAI and Google can help prevent the deterioration of Wikipedia, including by changing the design of their chatbots to encourage users to click through to the website.

Ms. Clover is concerned about AI slop infiltrating the website, how the chatbots can make up information, including sources, and how that could lead to a greater distrust online. However, she's not too worried about AI leading to a decline in editors. 

Over Google Meet, she pulls up a graph showing the change in the frequency of edits from 2006 to 2020. The line is remarkably consistent throughout the past 14 years. 

“And how different is the world compared to how it was in 2006? I think we'll get through this.” 

Walking around Queen's Park earlier this summer, Mr. Filipowich was quick to pull out his phone and look up facts on Wikipedia – how old Mackenzie was when he died (66) or to confirm the alibi of a former Toronto mayor accused of being at the Upper Canada Rebellion (he wouldn't be wearing sunglasses at night, like his accuser claimed). 

The statues dotted throughout the park also served as reminders of Mr. Filipowich's to-do list of articles he wants to update. His current big project is the page of George Brown, the 19th century politician and founder of The Globe, to featured article status. He's about three-quarters through one of Brown's two-volume biographies. The work of the Wikipedia editor never ends.

Chinese Premier Li Qiang warned that without a global consensus AI could become an ""exclusive game"" for a few countries and companies. It comes days after US President Donald Trump unveiled plans to slash regulations.

Chinese Premier Li Qiang on Saturday urged the international community to build a global consensus on artificial intelligence (AI) governance, highlighting security risks amid the raging tech race between Beijing and Washington.

Speaking at the opening of the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) in Shanghai, Li said it is prudent to look at ""how to find a balance between development and security [which] urgently requires further consensus from the entire society.""

Li also announced the creation of a Chinese-led body to promote global AI cooperation and open-source development to keep AI from becoming ""the preserve of a few countries and a few enterprises.""

The three-day WAIC event comes amid intensifying US-China competition in advanced AI technology.

Just days before, US President Donald Trump announced the slashing of AI regulations to maintain the US' dominance in the field even as Washington continues to restrict exports of high-end chips to China, citing national security concerns.

These restrictions are forcing Chinese companies to look for alternatives, with startup DeepSeek introducing an AI model in January that matched the performance of leading US systems, despite working on less advanced chips.

Li, without naming the US, criticized monopolistic control and called for open access to AI technologies, warning of insufficient supply of AI chips and restrictions on talent exchange otherwise.

""Only by adhering to openness, sharing and fairness in access to intelligence can more countries and groups benefit from (AI),"" he said.

At the WAIC opening ceremony, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a video message that AI regulation would be ""a defining test of international cooperation.""

More than 800 companies are participating in this year's WAIC, showcasing over 3,000 tech innovations.

While Chinese firms like Huawei and Alibaba are the main entrants, international firms including US-based companies Tesla, Alphabet, and Amazon are also present.

The German state of Baden-Württemberg's deputy speaker stepped down after admitting he drew a swastika on a ballot beside an AfD lawmaker's name. Daniel Born said he had made a ""serious mistake"" during a vote.

The deputy speaker of the parliament in the southwestern state of Baden-Württemberg stepped down on Friday from his role after admitting he had drawn a swastika on a ballot paper next to the name of a far-right AfD lawmaker.

Center-left Social Democrat (SPD) politician Daniel Born made the transgression during a vote involving two Alternative for Germany (AfD) lawmakers.

In a statement, the Born said he had made a ""serious mistake"" during a ""momentary lapse.""

The incident happened during Thursday's election of deputy members to the cross-border Upper Rhine Council, a consultative body.

Two AfD lawmakers were on the ballot. A swastika was found on one of the ballots next to the name of AfD candidate Bernhard Eisenhut.

The news that someone had drawn a swastika prompted widespread outrage. Initially, it was unclear who had drawn the Nazi symbol.

State parliament president Muhterem Aras from the Green Party called the act a ""criminal offense,"" and the parliament filed a criminal complaint with police on Thursday evening, initially against an unknown perpetrator.

On Friday, Born said he would also step down from the SPD parliamentary group. However, Born stopped short of giving up his seat in parliament. 

""This was a serious error of judgment,"" he said. ""I deeply regret this and accept the consequences.""

""I made a serious mistake and in a moment of rash emotion drew a swastika behind the name of an AfD candidate,"" Born wrote in an email to other parliamentary leaders, quoted by public broadcaster SWR. ""I will never forgive myself for this failure.""

The swastika was the symbol of National Socialism and the party logo of the Nazi Party.

Whether marking a swastika on a ballot during a secret vote constitutes a prosecutable crime remains to be determined by investigators and possibly the courts. Under Germany's Criminal Code, the use of unconstitutional symbols can be punishable by up to three years in prison or a fine.

Born, 49, had been a member of parliament since 2016 and served as one of the legislature's vice presidents since 2021. He also acted as the SPD's spokesperson on religious affairs.

Explaining his actions, Born cited deep concern over the far-right AfD and its disruptive conduct during Thursday's vote. ""The speeches yesterday and the chaos caused by the AfD shook me deeply,"" he wrote. ""I was in a state of emotional distress and completely failed.""

Parliament president Aras spoke of a scandal and on Friday called on the ""person responsible"" to resign from their parliamentary seat.

""I have come to know Daniel Born as a passionate parliamentarian,"" said Aras. ""Nevertheless, I expect him to resign his seat as well.""

Despite calls for cooperation and limited climate pledges, the EU-China summit exposed deep divisions and confirmed that long-term tensions are likely to persist.

Chinese President Xi Jinping met with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Beijing at a tense bilateral summit this week, making no headway on geopolitical disputes and only modest advances on trade and climate change.

While EU leaders raised concerns over China's export surplus flooding European markets with cheap goods, and Beijing allegedly providing support for Russia's war in Ukraine, Chinese officials denied responsibility for these challenges and instead called for a deepening of the partnership.

""As our cooperation has deepened, so have imbalances,"" von der Leyen told Xi during their meeting, describing EU-China trade imbalances as having reached ""an inflection point"" where China must ""come forward with real solutions."" 

But Xi told von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa that ""there are no fundamental conflicts of interest or geopolitical contradictions"" between the two sides, and urged the bloc to ""properly handle differences and frictions.""

""It is hoped that the European side will keep the trade and investment market open and refrain from using restrictive economic and trade tools,"" Xi said, according to a Chinese version of a press release published by China's Foreign Ministry.

Despite the apparent discrepancy over trade and the Ukraine war, the two sides found common ground on climate change, releasing a joint statement that reaffirmed their commitment to deepen cooperation on the green transition.

They have also agreed to establish what von der Leyen described as an ""upgraded export supply mechanism"" aimed at fast-tracking licenses for rare earth materials — over which China dominates global supply and has recently tightened export controls.

Still, the summit is unlikely to shift the trajectory of EU-China tensions in the long run, said Abigael Vasselier, head of the foreign relations team at the Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS) during an online media briefing.

""Europe needs to be ready for a long-term struggle and probably needs to rethink its China strategy at this stage,"" she said.

In the run-up to the summit, EU-China relations hit rock bottom amid trade friction and geopolitical grievances.

Earlier this month, the bloc included Chinese banks and companies for the first time in a new sanctions package against Russia for its attack on Ukraine.

Beijing then threatened to respond with necessary steps to counter Europe's move that ""seriously harmed the trade, economic and financial ties.""

Revived hawkish rhetoric toward China was evident in a recent speech by von der Leyen, in which she accused China of ""de facto enabling Russia's war economy.""

At a press conference following the summit, the European leader once again urged China to use its influence to ""make sure that Russia is coming seriously to the negotiation table.""

Zsuzsa Anna Ferenczy, an affiliated scholar at the Free University of Brussels, said the message the EU sends to China was ""clear and consistent"" once again at the summit.

""What Europe needs to do is to hold its ground and try to stay as coherent as possible … so that we do not allow China to divide and undermine the unity that we have,"" she told DW.

Prior to the summit, many in Brussels were surprised by reports of an unexpectedly frank remark made by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who allegedly told the EU's top diplomat that it would not be in Beijing's interest to see a Russian loss in Ukraine.

Wang Guochen, a China economy assistant research fellow at Taiwan's Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER), said these recent interactions have escalated tensions and the summit once again ""confirmed that China-EU relations are unlikely to improve.""

During his speech at the summit, China's Xi mentioned a ""win-win situation"" multiple times to invite the EU to ""jointly promote an equal and orderly world multipolarization and inclusive economic globalization.""

Grzegorz Stec, head of the Brussels office at MERICS, told DW prior to the summit that Beijing's goal is to ""erode the EU's de-risking and trade defense strategies and keep the market open for as long as possible.""

China is currently dealing with overcapacity against a backdrop of limited domestic consumption and 33 consecutive months of deflation as of June.

""China is producing too much and it needs those goods to go somewhere. That's what makes access to Europe still relevant and important,"" said Stec.

By limiting the summit's deliverables to rare earth-related agreements, China appears to be leveraging its export restrictions on critical minerals to pressure the EU into scaling back, or even lifting, tariffs of up to 45% on Chinese electric vehicles.

Under Beijing's new regulations, exporters of rare earth elements and magnets must obtain a license for every shipment and submit documentation detailing how the materials will be used.

And although the summit produced an agreement on an ""upgraded export supply mechanism,"" it likely fell short of European businesses' expectations of easing the stringent export controls.

Even though the summit ended with few meaningful outcomes, it may still be seen as a positive result from Beijing's perspective, given the worsening trans-Atlantic relationship.

Just a day before the meeting, EU diplomats told reporters that the bloc was moving toward a trade deal with Washington that would impose a broad 15% tariff on EU goods — avoiding a previously proposed 30% rate.

Still, a growing number of EU member states, including Germany, are reportedly considering invoking wide-ranging ""anti-coercion"" measures if a deal cannot be reached by August 1.

""China could demonstrate that it is committed to pursuing cooperation and project itself as a solution provider, as a peace supporter in a turbulent world,"" Ferenczy said.

""This is the language the Chinese side often uses both internationally and domestically — that China and the EU are meant for positive cooperation,"" she added.

But not everyone sees Beijing as having the upper hand after the summit.

""From my perspective, Beijing actually lost out here,"" said Wang, the China economy researcher. ""With US-EU relations being strained … Beijing still didn't succeed in winning over Europe.""

Before the genocide, malnutrition was a rare diagnosis. Now more than 2 million Gazans are forced to survive on nothing.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

I first learned about malnutrition from textbooks and documentaries in my medical school. I followed the scenes of hunger emerging from Somalia and South Sudan. I wholeheartedly felt them — with every sip of potable water I drank while theirs was polluted, with each bite of food I ate while they were reduced to skin and bones. Yet I never imagined that one day, I would be in their place — subjected not just to killing, but also to starvation and malnutrition.

Malnutrition, as defined by the World Health Organization, is a deficiency, excess, or imbalance in a person's intake of energy and nutrients. It may be caused by reduced dietary intake, malabsorption of macro- and micronutrients, or increased energy expenditure related to disease. But in Gaza, the meaning of malnutrition has been forcibly redefined — it is systematically human-made and weaponized. It is no longer just a health condition, but a calculated strategy. Since March 2, Israeli forces have sealed off the borders and imposed what may be the tightest blockade in our history of struggle, deliberately restricting food access.

Before the genocide, malnutrition was a rare diagnosis. Today, more than 2 million Gazans are forced to survive on nothing. Flour is scarce. Canned food is consumed while fresh vegetables remain a distant dream, unavailable or unaffordable. Aid parcels — meant to save lives — may cost a Palestinian their life, as Gaza's humanitarian “relief” system has become a death trap disguised as mercy.

In Gaza, the meaning of malnutrition has been forcibly redefined — it is systematically human-made and weaponized. 

We have been forced not only to skip meals, but also to skip entire days of eating, exposing our bodies to lethal complications. Acute malnutrition is not just about hunger or weight loss. It attacks every organ system, bringing severe risks of illness and death — especially for the young and the elderly. My nephews, born and raised under genocide, have had no chance to build strength or immunity. Pale and emaciated, with fragile bodies, they fight disease with nothing but weakness.

Malnutrition impairs the immune system, leaving us defenseless against disease. I, myself, became vulnerable to the simplest infections — bedridden for days, even weeks, unable to function. Malnutrition doesn't just cause illness, it prolongs it. It adds layers to our suffering, and offers no escape from its vicious cycle.

Malnutrition also attacks the cardiovascular system — decreasing cardiac output, disrupting blood flow, and causing arrhythmia, low blood pressure, and even heart failure. I suffered tachycardia (a too-fast heart rate), nausea, and fainting spells caused by severe deficiency. For the elderly — especially those with preexisting heart conditions — this is a death sentence.

Deficiencies in essential vitamins and minerals impair memory, concentration, and cognition. I suffer these effects daily, trying to study while living under the shadow of death.

The gastrointestinal system suffers too, if not immediately, then over time. Malnutrition impairs the intestines' ability to absorb nutrients and regulate electrolytes. Living off canned food for nearly two years has inflamed my peptic ulcers and worsened my colitis.

As a medical student, I knew what might help even a little. I once kept a supply of supplementary vitamins, but now due to Israel's blockade, vitamins are impossible to access. 

Recently, a diabetic patient died during a hypoglycemic attack — his family couldn't find a single sweet to save him. Mothers across Gaza are unable to breastfeed their starving infants — because they themselves are starving. UN agencies have distributed therapeutic food, but it's nowhere near enough. Most mothers give it to their children and go hungry themselves.

Malnutrition doesn't stop at the body — it invades the mind. It disrupts serotonin production, causing severe depression, anxiety, and emotional instability. Deficiencies in essential vitamins and minerals impair memory, concentration, and cognition. I suffer these effects daily, trying to study while living under the shadow of death. My memory falters, my thoughts scatter. Children deprived of nutrition face lifelong consequences to their growth, both mental and physical.

Malnutrition also delays healing and worsens clinical outcomes. I spoke to Rawan Y., a fellow medical student and survivor of a genocidal injury. She told me: “I got injured on March 2 and was discharged on March 17. Back then, we were on the edge of famine. Then famine invaded. I underwent three surgeries. I was supposed to get the nutritious food I needed for recovery — but the reality was the stark opposite.”

She paused, her voice cracking.

“I live with the torment of knowing what's happening inside my body. I know the damage. I had spleen and kidney injuries, first-degree burns, and three broken ribs. It's been four months — and my wounds remain unhealed, painful, and persistent.”

Dr. Mohammed Altalla, who works as a doctor in a surgical department in Gaza and also serves as a teaching assistant in the faculty of medicine at Gaza's Al Azhar University, confirmed the devastating toll of malnutrition on recovery:

“One of the major consequences of malnutrition is delayed healing. Proteins, vitamins, and zinc are simply unavailable. Surgical site infections have surged – we deal with them daily,” he told me. 

“People collapse in the streets, rushed to hospitals. The life-saving intervention in many cases is as simple as glucose. But even that is running out.” 

I also spoke with Shaimaa Bashir, a clinical nutritionist working with a humanitarian organization on the ground in Gaza. She told me that acute malnutrition has risen by 146 percent in just three months. “Hundreds of thousands of patients are hospitalized daily with complications from malnutrition — irregular heartbeats, dangerously low blood pressure,” she said. “Many were already vulnerable even before their injuries — now it's far worse.”

Moreover, Bashir notes: “Since mid-May 2025, Gaza has been in an unprecedented severe food emergency. Ninety-three percent of the population faces food insecurity. Twenty-two percent are now in phase five — the catastrophic phase — of hunger. If no aid arrives, we expect the entire population will fall into phase four — acute severe malnutrition — by September 2025.”

Meanwhile, 17,000 women who are pregnant or breastfeeding desperately need medical nutrition, but none is available due to severe drug shortages and constant displacement. A malnourished mother may pass her malnutrition to her infant — or face miscarriage.

Bashir added that feeding options for patients are almost nonexistent. “We have no access to therapeutic food, IV nutrition, or nasogastric tubes,” she said. “The only remaining source is supplementary sweets for children — and even that is in short supply.”

“People collapse in the streets, rushed to hospitals. The life-saving intervention in many cases is as simple as glucose. But even that is running out,” Altalla said. 

Then he paused, his voice quieter: “It's not just the patients. We — the medical staff — are barely functioning. We struggle to stay focused ourselves.”

“The food situation is so dire that every day the question arises whether the patients in the hospitals we support and the medical staff who care for them will be able to eat anything at all,” echoed Caroline Willemen, a project coordinator in Gaza City for Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders), in a statement. “We are desperate. As an occupying power the Israeli authorities have an obligation to provide aid to people in Gaza. Right now, they are deliberately starving them.”

The health of more than 2 million people hangs in the balance, clinging to the hope of aid trucks that never come.

Each delay is a death sentence.

Each denied truck is a stolen chance at survival.

Malnutrition is preventable. It is reversible.

But not under Israel's siege.

I first learned about malnutrition from textbooks and documentaries in my medical school. I followed the scenes of hunger emerging from Somalia and South Sudan. I wholeheartedly felt them — with every sip of potable water I drank while theirs was polluted, with each bite of food I ate while they were reduced to skin and bones. Yet I never imagined that one day, I would be in their place — subjected not just to killing, but also to starvation and malnutrition.

There's no cookie-cutter solution to confronting fascism; action must be grounded in analysis, says Robin D. G. Kelley.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

The anti-colonial struggle for a free Palestine has reached a desperate point as the Israeli military regularly fires on starving Palestinians seeking aid and water. Meanwhile, the rise of fascism in the United States continues at an alarming pace, with unprecedented funding passed for Immigration and Customs Enforcement expansion as the public continues to witness masked kidnappings and disappearances.

Seventy-five years after the publication of Aimé Césaire's Discourse on Colonialism, Robin D.G. Kelley argues that the book still has important lessons to teach in the current historical moment. Fascist states are not a perversion of liberal democracies but rather their extension, and it is critically important that anti-fascism incorporates anti-colonial approaches.

In this exclusive interview for Truthout, Kelley offers a vision of the work needed on the left that goes beyond looking for answers or examples to follow. Kelley is a professor of U.S. history at the University of California, Los Angeles, and an author or editor of more than a dozen books, including Freedom Dreams and Hammer and Hoe. The interview that follows has been lightly edited for clarity and length.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

October Krausch: You started your remarks at the Socialism Conference by saying you're a better historian than activist. Why was it important to you to name that right at the top?

Robin D. G. Kelley: It's part of a larger point I was making about what it means to be at this conference where people are literally looking for answers. I think we have done an absolutely horrible job of understanding and analyzing both the conditions now and before. A lot of people want inspiration from me. They want me to get people inspired about the possible future and what we're going to do. Because I write about social movements, they want me to pull out examples, and that's not useful to me. I specifically gave a lecture that was about understanding the things that are not so clear to us: the close relationship between liberalism and fascism historically and in the present, and the fundamentally intertwined relationship between colonialism and fascism. That's what I do well. If someone says, “Well I need you to go out and get 40,000 signatures,” I can't do that.

Some people have decided that scholarship and analysis are less important than action. I'm not saying it's more important or less; I'm saying you can't separate it. By holding up action separate from critical analysis, we end up fetishizing this invention called the activist. And then they say, “Yeah, we love Robin because he's an activist.”

So that was my way of saying I don't want to be in a position where people say, “So what do we do?” Because that's for all of us as a collective to figure out. And I wanted people to listen and follow this analysis, which I think is useful, but not so much for literal lessons. I don't think history works that way. The lessons to me are the lessons that Césaire laid out [in Discourse on Colonialism] in terms of the relationship.

What you're saying reminds me of something I've learned from abolition: One of the problems with the criminal legal system is its cookie-cutter approach. We have essentially the exact same prison in Michigan and in Texas and in California, then the U.S. exports those prisons to Brazil and that's the “solution” for all kinds of harm. I've learned a lot by taking seriously that history doesn't work that way, the social world doesn't work that way, conflicts don't work that way. But you see that desire for a template to follow repeated all over. Very few things work that way and it creates a lot of harm.

Exactly. It's also that the powers that be want you to use a cookie-cutter approach. I feel like part of my whole project as a Marxist historian is to try to locate and understand what we can't see. That's what Karl Marx did. In Capital, Volume 1, Marx talks about the secret of the labor theory of value. All that value, you can't see it; it's hidden because it's in labor power.

There can never be a cookie-cutter approach because we've got to figure out what we don't see. I fear sometimes it's very easy to fall into the trap of empiricism. People would think, Well, of course because if something is empirical it means that we can actually locate it and see it. The problem is it's hiding other things that we can't see.

I've never been one to only write about the glories and the existence of working people because we have to understand what is it that reproduces work. Why is it that they're fighting in the first place? Why is it that they're losing? That means studying power. That means like reading all 925 pages or whatever it is of Project 2025. To me, that's just as important as reading personal narratives of working people winning.

At the keynote, you talked a lot about the continuity of fascism and liberal democracy, especially the continuity of fascism and colonialism. You offered that the establishment of Israel precisely in the era of formal international decolonization is a really powerful example of why we have fascism here in the United States today: Colonialism never ended and we will always have the problem of fascism if we're not thinking about those as intertwined things. Some of your examples were about anti-fascist struggles that were not anti-colonial or were anti-Black. Your lecture had me thinking about Sophie Lewis's recent book, Enemy Feminisms. One of the things Lewis says is that, as feminists, we have a tendency to define, say, anti-abortion feminists or KKK feminists, as outside of “real” feminism. Lewis says that we have to own that and then we have to think about where the seeds of domination and white supremacy lie inside of feminism. Do you think it makes sense to think in a similar way about enemy lefts or enemy socialisms?

The left has already done that. We call it sectarianism! Unfortunately, it's not always been done in the most thoughtful way. I think what Sophie Lewis is trying to do in the book is very thoughtful in terms of having a critical analysis of the positions that are within a framework of feminism. It's not to abandon feminism, but to really understand it. With the enemy socialism example, these folks are basically constructing enemies as a way of either trying to maintain or attain some kind of hegemony within left circles, or because they have a disagreement in analysis that's not a fundamental disagreement in values.

Part of my concern is actually the opposite. I understand enemy feminists, but once we start to do what the left has done for a long time — that is, attack those we disagree with as social fascists or as left opportunists — there's no opportunity to build through critique, dialogue, and struggle, which offers a way of understanding that maybe our critique is wrong.

For me, that's also about grace. There are some people in left organizations who I completely disagree with, including (and I struggle with this) the leftists who have a really bad position on race. I could make a decision to sort of expose and dispose of them, or to say, “Okay, let's critique that failure to understand race.”

I'm so frustrated with the Marxist-Leninists who are basically applauding Donald Trump because the Trump administration is getting rid of DEI [diversity, equity, and inclusion], like, “Well, that's great, because DEI is just a neoliberal trick.” For me, that's just dumb. So rather than say, “Oh, they're the enemy,” I write and argue and publicly speak against that position and explain why. I expect and want a response. Because to debate it and recognize that we share a lot in common is to pull people within that movement into ours.

I'm wrestling with some of these ideas and I think a lot of people are. When is someone your enemy? And when is it like, “Okay, we can travel together for a certain amount of time”? That's a difficult decision to make and there's no template for it. At the same time, we have to really draw some hard lines because people are going to sell us out when we're in these higher stakes.

“Exploiting the seabed is not a necessity — it is a choice,” said Palau's president. “And it is reckless.”

Despite growing momentum, world governments failed to agree to a moratorium on deep-sea mining as the 30th session of the International Seabed Authority wrapped up on Friday.

The authority's July meeting was the first since U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to expedite permits for deep-sea mining under U.S. authority and The Metals Company (TMC) promptly applied for U.S. permits. Governments rebuked the U.S. and TMC for their unilateral approach and did not agree on a mining code that would allow the controversial practice to move forward under international law. However, campaigners said more decisive action is needed to protect the ocean and its biodiversity.

“Governments have yet to rise to the moment,” Greenpeace International campaigner Louisa Casson said in a statement. “They remain disconnected from global concerns and the pressing need for courageous leadership to protect the deep ocean.”

Casson continued: “We call on the international community to rise up and defend multilateralism against rogue actors like The Metals Company. Governments must respond by establishing a moratorium and reaffirming that authority over the international seabed lies collectively with all states — for the benefit of humanity as a whole.”

The International Seabed Authority (ISA) gains its authority to regulate deep-sea mining under the United Nations Law of the Sea, to which the U.S. is not party. TMC, however, could suffer consequences for bypassing the international process, as other countries and companies may decide not to do business with it.

At the most recent session, the ISA's council decided not to revoke exploratory permits it had previously granted to TMC and its subsidiaries. However, it approved an investigation on Monday into whether mining contractors such as TMC subsidiaries Nauru Ocean Resources Inc. and Tonga Offshore Mining Limited were abiding by their obligations under international law.

“TMC has been testing the limits of what it can get away with, a bit like a child seeing how far it can go with bad behavior,” Matthew Gianni, cofounder of the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition (DSCC), told The New York Times.

“The member countries of the ISA have basically sent a shot across the bow, a warning to TMC that going rogue may well result in the loss of its ISA exploration claims,” Gianna explained, adding that the investigation also served as a warning to other companies who might consider following TMC's example.

Casson agreed: “The international community's message to The Metals Company is clear: Violating international law, ignoring scientific consensus, and disregarding human rights will have consequences. This is also a warning to any companies or governments choosing to align themselves with [TMC CEO] Gerard Barron's business model — they must be prepared to bear the reputational fallout of trying to destroy the ocean.”

At the same time, a U.S. representative spoke on Thursday, doubling down on Trump's dismissal of the international process and earning instant push back from Brazil, France, and China

“As a non-party to the Law of the Sea Convention, the United States is not bound by the convention rules dealing with seabed mining through the International Seabed Authority,” the U.S. statement said in part.

The statement came days after Greenpeace released a report titled Deep Deception: How the Deep-Sea Mining Industry is Manipulating Geopolitics to Profit from Ocean Destruction, which details how TMC and other deep-sea mining companies are exploiting national security concerns to lobby U.S. lawmakers to fast track deep-sea mining.

“The U.S. statement confirms what Deep Deception has already exposed: The Trump administration's pursuit of deep-sea mining isn't about global stewardship — it's about sidestepping it,” Arlo Hemphill, Greenpeace USA's project lead for the Stop Deep-Sea Mining campaign, said in a statement. “By rejecting the ISA's authority while claiming environmental responsibility, the U.S. is trying to have it both ways — and in doing so is advancing a ‘smash and grab' agenda that puts ocean health and international cooperation at serious risk.”

Ultimately, ocean advocates agree that the only way to protect the deep sea is for governments to agree to a precautionary pause on a practice they argue would do irreparable harm to ecosystems science barely understands.

The consensus for such a pause is building, with Croatia becoming the 38th nation to support one during the latest ISA meeting.

“The ISA is paralyzed by a small group clinging to outdated extraction agendas while blocking even the most basic reforms,” Simon Holmström, the deep-sea mining policy officer for Seas at Risk, said in a statement. “The firm rejection of the U.S. and The Metals Company's power grab, alongside 38 countries now calling for a moratorium or precautionary pause, shows growing resistance to sacrificing the planet's least understood ecosystem for corporate short-term profit.”

Several nations spoke strongly in favor a moratorium, including Palau, Panama, and France.

“Exploiting the seabed is not a necessity — it is a choice,” said His Excellency Surangel S. Whipps Jr., president of the Republic of Palau, on Tuesday. “And it is reckless. It is gambling with the future of Pacific Island children, who will inherit the dire consequences of decisions made far from their shores.”

A Pacific leader from Solomon Island also defended the interests of the Pacific Ocean community: “As Pacific people, we continue to carry the trauma of what extractive industries have already done to our homes. Mining companies that came with promises, stripped our lands and waters, and left behind ecological, cultural, and spiritual scars. We cannot let that cycle repeat itself, in the ocean that connects us. That sustains us. And that defines us.”

Olivier Poivre d'Arvor of France called for a pause of 10-15 years: “Our message is clear: no deep-sea mining without science, without collective legitimacy, without equity […] France is calling for a moratorium or a precautionary pause. What for? Because we refuse to mortgage the future for a few nodules extracted in a hurry, in favor of a few.”

However, campaigners argued that many governments continued to fall short of the commitments they had made at the U.N. Ocean Conference (UNOC) in Nice in early June.

“Thirty-eight states have now joined the call for a moratorium or precautionary pause, with Croatia joining the coalition during this Assembly,” said DSCC campaign director Sofia Tsenikli. “But too many other states, which were bold in their ocean promises at UNOC, are not putting this into action at the ISA. Governments must meet their promises by doing what it takes to implement a moratorium before it's too late.”

Farah Obaidullah, founder and director of The Ocean and Us, argued that the ocean already faces too many other threats to add the additional burden of deep-sea mining.

“The health of the high seas including the seabed is critical to our own. Yet our shared heritage faces an onslaught of threats from climate and nature collapse, escalating tensions, and failed leadership,” Obaidullah said. “To even consider a new form of ecocide on our already ailing planet is both reckless and irrational. We know that deep-sea mining will devastate life in the deep ocean, wipe out species before they have been discovered, and impact ocean functions, including carbon sequestration. When it comes to the ocean we have no time to lose. We cannot colonize and conquer our shared heritage which belongs to us all. There is only one responsible way forward, and that is to secure a moratorium on deep-sea mining.”

DSCC's Gianni also argued strongly for a pause: “Being on the fence or remaining silent is not a politically defensible position. We are risking severe ecological damage, and future generations will ask what we did to stop it. There is still a chance to stop this industry before it begins, but only if governments stand up for science, equity, and precaution now, and take action to prevent compani"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:truthout.org","World's Governments Fail to Agree to a Moratorium on Deep-Sea Mining","https://truthout.org/articles/worlds-governments-fail-to-agree-to-a-moratorium-on-deep-sea-mining/","Sat, 26 Jul 2025 21:07:19 GMT","

Under the agreement reached between President Donald Trump and Columbia University regarding campus anti-Semitism, the Ivy League school will pay a $200 million fine to regain its eligibility for future federal money.

nder of the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition (DSCC), told The New York Times.

“The member countries of the ISA have basically sent a shot across the bow, a warning to TMC that going rogue may well result in the loss of its ISA exploration claims,” Gianna explained, adding that the investigation also served as a warning to other companies who might consider following TMC's example.

Casson agreed: “The international community's message to The Metals Company is clear: Violating international law, ignoring scientific consensus, and disregarding human rights will have consequences. This is also a warning to any companies or governments choosing to align themselves with [TMC CEO] Gerard Barron's business model — they must be prepared to bear the reputational fallout of trying to destroy the ocean.”

At the same time, a U.S. representative spoke on Thursday, doubling down on Trump's dismissal of the international process and earning instant push back from Brazil, France, and China

“As a non-party to the Law of the Sea Convention, the United States is not bound by the convention rules dealing with seabed mining through the International Seabed Authority,” the U.S. statement said in part.

The statement came days after Greenpeace released a report titled Deep Deception: How the Deep-Sea Mining Industry is Manipulating Geopolitics to Profit from Ocean Destruction, which details how TMC and other deep-sea mining companies are exploiting national security concerns to lobby U.S. lawmakers to fast track deep-sea mining.

“The U.S. statement confirms what Deep Deception has already exposed: The Trump administration's pursuit of deep-sea mining isn't about global stewardship — it's about sidestepping it,” Arlo Hemphill, Greenpeace USA's project lead for the Stop Deep-Sea Mining campaign, said in a statement. “By rejecting the ISA's authority while claiming environmental responsibility, the U.S. is trying to have it both ways — and in doing so is advancing a ‘smash and grab' agenda that puts ocean health and international cooperation at serious risk.”

Ultimately, ocean advocates agree that the only way to protect the deep sea is for governments to agree to a precautionary pause on a practice they argue would do irreparable harm to ecosystems science barely understands.

The consensus for such a pause is building, with Croatia becoming the 38th nation to support one during the latest ISA meeting.

“The ISA is paralyzed by a small group clinging to outdated extraction agendas while blocking even the most basic reforms,” Simon Holmström, the deep-sea mining policy officer for Seas at Risk, said in a statement. “The firm rejection of the U.S. and The Metals Company's power grab, alongside 38 countries now calling for a moratorium or precautionary pause, shows growing resistance to sacrificing the planet's least understood ecosystem for corporate short-term profit.”

Several nations spoke strongly in favor a moratorium, including Palau, Panama, and France.

“Exploiting the seabed is not a necessity — it is a choice,” said His Excellency Surangel S. Whipps Jr., president of the Republic of Palau, on Tuesday. “And it is reckless. It is gambling with the future of Pacific Island children, who will inherit the dire consequences of decisions made far from their shores.”

A Pacific leader from Solomon Island also defended the interests of the Pacific Ocean community: “As Pacific people, we continue to carry the trauma of what extractive industries have already done to our homes. Mining companies that came with promises, stripped our lands and waters, and left behind ecological, cultural, and spiritual scars. We cannot let that cycle repeat itself, in the ocean that connects us. That sustains us. And that defines us.”

Olivier Poivre d'Arvor of France called for a pause of 10-15 years: “Our message is clear: no deep-sea mining without science, without collective legitimacy, without equity […] France is calling for a moratorium or a precautionary pause. What for? Because we refuse to mortgage the future for a few nodules extracted in a hurry, in favor of a few.”

However, campaigners argued that many governments continued to fall short of the commitments they had made at the U.N. Ocean Conference (UNOC) in Nice in early June.

“Thirty-eight states have now joined the call for a moratorium or precautionary pause, with Croatia joining the coalition during this Assembly,” said DSCC campaign director Sofia Tsenikli. “But too many other states, which were bold in their ocean promises at UNOC, are not putting this into action at the ISA. Governments must meet their promises by doing what it takes to implement a moratorium before it's too late.”

Farah Obaidullah, founder and director of The Ocean and Us, argued that the ocean already faces too many other threats to add the additional burden of deep-sea mining.

“The health of the high seas including the seabed is critical to our own. Yet our shared heritage faces an onslaught of threats from climate and nature collapse, escalating tensions, and failed leadership,” Obaidullah said. “To even consider a new form of ecocide on our already ailing planet is both reckless and irrational. We know that deep-sea mining will devastate life in the deep ocean, wipe out species before they have been discovered, and impact ocean functions, including carbon sequestration. When it comes to the ocean we have no time to lose. We cannot colonize and conquer our shared heritage which belongs to us all. There is only one responsible way forward, and that is to secure a moratorium on deep-sea mining.”

DSCC's Gianni also argued strongly for a pause: “Being on the fence or remaining silent is not a politically defensible position. We are risking severe ecological damage, and future generations will ask what we did to stop it. There is still a chance to stop this industry before it begins, but only if governments stand up for science, equity, and precaution now, and take action to prevent companies within their jurisdiction from cooperating with rogue mining operations.”

Greenpeace's Hemphill concluded: “Governments must secure a moratorium that leaves no room for a desperate industry to force through a mining code. The science is not ready. The legal framework is not in place. The world must not be bullied into an irreversible mistake for the benefit of a few.”

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.
