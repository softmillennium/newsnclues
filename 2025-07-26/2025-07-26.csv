            The leaders of Cambodia and Thailand have agreed to meet for ceasefire talks after days of cross-border violence, according to statements on Saturday from both sides as well as US President Donald Trump.
    


            Trump said earlier in the weekend that he had spoken with both Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and acting prime minister of Thailand Phumtham Wechayachai in his efforts to restore peace.
    


Thai-Cambodian conflict pits a well-equipped US ally against a weaker adversary with strong China links



            “They have agreed to immediately meet and quickly work out a Ceasefire and, ultimately, PEACE!” Trump wrote on Truth Social in a series of posts on outlining his diplomatic efforts on Saturday.
    


            Trump said he had warned Hun Manet and Phumtham that he would not make trade deals with either country if the deadly border conflict continued.
    


            “They are also looking to get back to the “Trading Table” with the United States, which we think is inappropriate to do until such time as the fighting STOPS,” Trump wrote.
    


            Earlier this month, Trump wrote letters to Thailand and Cambodia threatening a 36% tariff on most of their exports to the US, starting August 1. Cambodia and Thailand both delivered substantial offers to their US counterparts in an effort to move to the front of the line for a trade agreement, officials said at the time.
    


            In the early hours of Sunday morning local time, Hun Manet thanked Trump and said that Cambodia agreed with “the proposal for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire between the two armed forces.” It added that he had previously called for a ceasefire to ASEAN chair and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
    


            A statement from Thailand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs was more measured, saying it wished to see “sincere intention from the Cambodian side” – but that Phumtham had also “requested President Trump to convey …that Thailand wants to convene a bilateral dialogue as soon as possible to bring forth measures and procedures for the ceasefire and the eventual peaceful resolution of the conflict.”
    


            Bangkok and Phnom Penh have been fighting over territory disputed since colonial power France drew the border between them more than a century ago. The renewed deadly conflict pits longtime US ally Thailand, with decades of experience, against Cambodia's relatively young armed force with close ties to China.
    


            Since fighting broke out on Thursday, more than a dozen people have been reported killed, dozens wounded, and more than 150,000 civilians evacuated. Clashes have continued into Saturday, according to officials on both sides.
    


            The United Nations has condemned the violence, with Secretary General António Guterres offering his assistance “in any efforts towards a peaceful resolution of the dispute” in a statement released Saturday by his spokesperson.

            The leaders of Cambodia and Thailand have agreed to meet to negotiate a ceasefire, according to a social media post by United States President Donald Trump on Saturday.
    


            Trump, who said he held separate calls with the Prime Minister of Cambodia and acting Prime Minister of Thailand, claimed that both countries, “have agreed to immediately meet and quickly work out a Ceasefire and, ultimately, PEACE!”
    


            The news came shortly after Trump called publicly on both parties to negotiate peace amid escalating violence on the disputed border between Thailand and Cambodia.
    


            Bangkok and Phnom Penh have been fighting over territory disputed since colonial power France drew the border between them more than a century ago. The renewed deadly conflict pits longtime US ally Thailand, with decades of experience, against Cambodia's relatively young armed force with close ties to China.
    


            Since fighting broke out on Thursday, more than a dozen people have been reported killed, dozens wounded, and more than 150,000 civilians evacuated. Clashes have continued into Saturday, according to officials on both sides.
    


            Here's a look at the histories and capabilities of the two sides.
    


            Thailand's military dwarfs that of neighboring Cambodia, both in personnel and weaponry.
    


            Thailand's total of 361,000 active-duty personnel spread across all branches of the kingdom's military is three times Cambodia's. And those troops have at their disposal weaponry their Cambodian counterparts could only dream of.
    


            “Thailand has a large, well-funded military and its air force is one of the best equipped and trained in Southeast Asia,” the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) wrote in its “Military Balance 2025” look at the world's armed forces.
    


            Meanwhile, a 2024 ranking of the military capabilities of 27 regional nations by the Lowy Institute places Thailand at 14th, to Cambodia's 23rd.
    


            Such a disparity is perhaps to be expected, given Thailand has four times as many people as Cambodia, and a GDP more than 10 times larger. Unlike Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, it escaped the ravages of the wars that engulfed the region in the second half of the 20th century, and the European colonialism that preceded them.
    


            Overall, with factors including military, economic, diplomatic and cultural power weighed in the Lowy Asia Power Index, Thailand is ranked 10th, considered a middle power, just behind Indonesia but ahead of countries including Malaysia and Vietnam.
    


            Lowy ranks Cambodia as a minor power in Asia, grouped with countries such as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Laos.
    


            In an earlier Truth Social post on Saturday, Trump said he has spoken to the acting prime minister of Thailand, Phumtham Wechayachai.
    


            “I have just spoken to the Acting Prime Minister of Thailand, and it was a very good conversation,” he wrote. “Thailand, like Cambodia, wants to have an immediate Ceasefire, and PEACE. I am now going to relay that message back to the Prime Minister of Cambodia. After speaking to both Parties, Ceasefire, Peace, and Prosperity seems to be a natural. We will soon see!”
    


            Thailand's military has long been a major player in the kingdom's politics. The country has for years been dominated by a conservative establishment comprising the military, the monarchy and influential elites.
    


            Generals have seized power in 20 coups since 1932, often toppling democratic governments, according to the CIA World Factbook, and the military portrays itself as the ultimate defender of the monarchy.
    


            Thailand is a United States treaty ally, a status dating back to the signing of the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty, also known as the Manila Pact, in 1954, according to the US State Department.
    


            During the Vietnam War, Thailand hosted US Air Force assets at some air bases, including B-52 bombers, and tens of thousands Thai troops fought on the side of the US-backed South Vietnam against the communist North.
    


            Strong ties between Washington and Bangkok have endured. Thailand is classed as a major non-NATO ally by the US, giving it special benefits that have enabled it to enjoy access to decades of US support for its weapons programs.
    


            Thailand and the US Indo-Pacific Command co-host the annual Cobra Gold military exercise, which began in 1982 as joint drills with the US but has since added dozens of other participants. It's the longest-running international military exercise in the world, according to the US military.
    


            Besides Cobra Gold, Thai and US forces hold more than 60 exercises together, and more than 900 US aircraft and 40 Navy ships visit Thailand yearly, the US State Department says.
    


            Despite all that history with Washington, these days the Thai military tries to maintain a more neutral approach to military policy, increasing ties with China in the past decade.
    


            Not wanting to rely on any one country as its arms supplier, it has also developed a strong domestic weapons industry, with the help of countries such as Israel, Italy, Russia, South Korea and Sweden, the “Military Balance” report says.
    


            Cambodia's military is young in comparison to Thailand's, established in 1993 after forces of the communist government were merged with two non-communist resistance armies, according to the IISS.
    


            “Cambodia's most important international defense links are with China and Vietnam. Despite a traditional reliance on Russia for defense equipment, China has emerged as a key supplier,” the IISS says.
    


            Beijing has even developed a naval base in Cambodia. The Ream Naval Base, on the Gulf of Thailand, would be able to host Chinese aircraft carriers, according to international analysts.
    


            Cambodia and China completed the seventh edition of their annual Golden Dragon joint military exercise in May, which was touted as the largest ever and featured live-fire training scenarios.
    


            It's a relationship that's expected to reach “a new level and achieve new development” this year, according to a February report on the People's Liberation Army's English-language website.

Violence is flaring again on the Thai-Cambodian border. Why is it so contentious?



            “China and Cambodia are iron-clad friends who… always support each other. The two militaries enjoy unbreakable relations and rock-solid brotherhood,” Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Senior Col. Wu Qian told a press conference in February, when asked about possible fissures in relations.
    


            Cambodia's military needs the support.
    


            “Cambodia currently lacks the ability to design and manufacture modern equipment for its armed forces,” the IISS report says.
    


            Bolstered by years of US support, the Royal Thai Air Force is well equipped, with at least 11 modern Swedish Gripen fighter jets and dozens of older, US-made F-16 and F-5 jets, according to the IISS. Cambodia has no combat-capable air force to speak of.
    


            On the ground, Thailand has dozens of battle tanks, including 60 modern, Chinese-made VT-4 tanks, and hundreds of older, US-made tanks. Cambodia has about 200 old Chinese- and Soviet-made tanks, the “Military Balance” shows.
    


            The Thai army boasts more than 600 artillery pieces, including at least 56 powerful 155mm weapons and more than 550 105mm towed guns. Cambodia has only a dozen 155mm guns with around 400 smaller towed artillery pieces, according to IISS figures.
    


            In the air, the army has US-made Cobra attack helicopters as well as 18 US Black Hawk transports. Cambodia has only a few dozen older Soviet and Chinese transport helicopters.
    


            Hawaii-based military analyst Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center, said that while Thailand has the numerical and qualitative military advantage, Cambodia has at least one thing in its favor – the actual land along the disputed border.
    


            “Terrain favors access from Cambodian territory to the disputed area,” Schuster told CNN.
    


            And with Cambodian forces allegedly  laying landmines and booby traps in the disputed area, Thailand can be expected to rely on longer-range weaponry, he said.
    


            “The Royal Thai Air Force is superior and their special forces are superior,” Schuster said. “I think the Thais will prefer to emphasize air power and long-range firepower in the conflict.”

            A Venezuelan baseball team was denied visas into the United States and will miss this year's Senior Baseball World Series, Little League International confirmed Friday.
    


            The Cacique Mara team, from Maracaibo, Venezuela, was scheduled to participate in the tournament after winning the Latin American championship in Mexico.
    


            “The Cacique Mara Little League team from Venezuela was unfortunately unable to obtain the appropriate visas to travel to the Senior League Baseball World Series,” Little League International said in a statement, adding that it is “extremely disappointing, especially to these young athletes.”
    


            The Venezuelan team traveled to Colombia two weeks ago to apply for their visas at the U.S. embassy in Bogotá.
    


            The embassy did not immediately respond to an Associated Press request for comment.
    


            “It is a mockery on the part of Little League to keep us here in Bogotá with the hope that our children can fulfill their dreams of participating in a world championship,” the team said in a statement. “What do we do with so much injustice, what do we do with the pain that was caused to our children?”
    


            Venezuela is among a list of countries with restrictions for entering the U.S. or its territories. President Donald Trump has banned travel to the U.S. from 12 other countries, citing national security concerns.
    


‘Our fans are feeling in fear': One year out from the World Cup, Mexico supporters are avoiding matches due to ICE concerns



            Earlier in the month, the Cuban women's volleyball team was denied visas to participate in a tournament in Puerto Rico.
    


            “They told us that Venezuela is on a list because Trump says Venezuelans are a threat to the security of his state, of his country,” said Kendrick Gutiérrez, the league's president in Venezuela. “It hasn't been easy the situation; we earned the right to represent Latin America in the World Championship.”
    


            The Senior League Baseball World Series, a tournament for players aged 13-16, is played each year in Easley, South Carolina. It begins Saturday.
    


            The tournament organizers replaced the Venezuelans with the Santa Maria de Aguayo team from Tamaulipas, Mexico, the team that was a runner-up in the Latin American championship.
    


            “I think this is the first time this has happened, but it shouldn't end this way. They're going to replace us with another team because relations have been severed; it's not fair,” Gutiérrez added. “I don't understand why they put Mexico in at the last minute and left Venezuela out.”

By Murad Sadygzade, President of the Middle East Studies Center, Visiting Lecturer, HSE University (Moscow).

By Murad Sadygzade, President of the Middle East Studies Center, Visiting Lecturer, HSE University (Moscow).

As expected, the events of October 7, 2023, became a turning point after which Israel's far-right government set a course toward the final elimination of the Palestinian issue. Under the pretext of ensuring national security and responding to attacks by Hamas, the Netanyahu government launched a large-scale military campaign in Gaza. However, behind the military rhetoric lies a strategic intent to dismantle any potential Palestinian self-governance and to displace the population – a process increasingly taking the form of ethnic cleansing.

Despite the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza – tens of thousands killed, destroyed infrastructure, a blockade on humanitarian aid – the Israeli authorities continue their offensive, disregarding both international law and numerous calls for a ceasefire. The international community, including the UN and leading humanitarian organizations, has voiced strong condemnation of the ongoing events. Yet, external pressure has so far failed to produce any significant changes. Instead of moving toward resolution, the conflict is spiraling deeper into a crisis of unprecedented scale and brutality.

Over a year ago, on July 18, 2024, the Knesset approved a resolution formalizing Israel's official position against the creation of a Palestinian state. The document, passed by a majority vote, established the Israeli parliament's “principled stance” that Palestinian statehood allegedly constitutes an existential threat to the State of Israel and its citizens.

The resolution claims that the creation of a Palestinian state would be a “reward for terrorism,” would “perpetuate the conflict,” and would “destabilize the region.” Moreover, lawmakers argued, should a Palestinian state emerge, control over it would soon fall into the hands of Hamas – the radical movement governing the Gaza Strip. In this context, the new state, in the Knesset's view, would become a “terror base” operating in coordination with the “axis of evil” led by Iran, aiming to destroy Israel. Thus, the declaration not only reflects the rigid ideological stance of the current political leadership but also effectively blocks any prospects for a political resolution to the Palestinian issue.

However, neither Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor the Israeli political establishment stopped there. Following the declaration against Palestinian statehood and the assertion of the West Bank's “principled” belonging to the Jewish people, came another step deepening the course toward the de facto annexation of occupied territories. On July 23, 2025, the Knesset passed a new, even more radical, resolution. The document explicitly proclaims the intention to extend Israeli sovereignty over the entire territory of the West Bank and to initiate the legal integration of this land into Israel's administrative and legal system.

The resolution received the support of 71 lawmakers, with 13 voting against – reflecting the continued rightward shift of the Israeli parliament and its consolidation around the idea of “Greater Israel.” The text states that “in the face of global antisemitism, military threats, and constant terror, Judea and Samaria cannot remain under temporary status,” and that “historical justice and security demand the official recognition of these territories as part of sovereign Israel.” The resolution was spearheaded by the same forces behind previous ones – members of Likud, the Religious Zionist Party, and Otzma Yehudit.

Although the new resolution, like its predecessors, does not formally entail immediate legislative consequences, it has become a significant signal: the annexation of the West Bank is no longer seen as a hypothetical possibility but is being advanced as a strategic objective. In practice, this means the continued expansion of Jewish settlements, the tightening of the military regime, and the displacement of the Palestinian population – despite international protests and systematic violations of international law, including the Geneva Convention.

Thus, Israel's political course has definitively shifted from a policy of “conflict containment” to the unilateral rewriting of the region's geopolitical reality.

In addition to active domestic measures aimed at legally and administratively cementing Israeli control over the occupied territories, Israel is increasingly deploying military-political tools against the so-called “Axis of Resistance” – an alliance of anti-Western and anti-Israeli forces led by Iran. In this context, Israel has adopted a comprehensive strategy to weaken the key players in this bloc, acting both directly and through allies – foremost among them, the United States.

Special focus was placed on Lebanon, where Israel achieved a significant success in its campaign against the Shiite movement Hezbollah. In September 2024, a high-precision operation resulted in the elimination of the group's long-standing leader, Hassan Nasrallah. According to Israeli and Western intelligence, the strike was carried out by a drone as part of a reconnaissance-sabotage mission in southern Lebanon. His death dealt a heavy blow to the moral and organizational core of the movement, which for decades symbolized resistance to Israeli expansion. Amid the chaos within Hezbollah following Nasrallah's elimination, Israel intensified its missile and air strikes on weapons depots, command posts, and infrastructure throughout southern Lebanon.

In parallel, through the American diplomatic apparatus, Israel has been lobbying for an initiative to partially or fully disarm Hezbollah, appealing to Lebanon's new pro-Western government formed in early 2025. The strategy is based on the assumption that international support and economic pressure will force Beirut to withdraw backing for the Shiite armed group.

Another direction of Israel's strategy is the Republic of Yemen, where systematic strikes have been carried out against positions of the Ansar Allah movement (the Houthis), which maintains close ties with Tehran. The Israeli Air Force conducted a series of targeted attacks on logistical routes and ballistic missile depots, especially in areas used by the Houthis for attacks on ships in the Red Sea. These actions were coordinated with operations by coalition forces led by the US and the United Kingdom, aimed at securing maritime navigation and limiting Iran's ability to project power through its proxies.

Syria remains another strategic priority. Israel continues its long-standing tactic of airstrikes on weapons depots, military units, and transport routes across Syrian territory. However, in recent months, this activity has been complemented by a more subtle approach: West Jerusalem is quietly supporting separatist movements within the country – primarily Druze and Kurdish groups. The creation of autonomous structures in these regions, aligned with the West or at least hostile to Damascus and Ankara, is seen as a way to further erode Syrian sovereignty and deprive Iran and Türkiye of their footholds in the Levant.

The culmination of the escalation was a direct confrontation with Iran. In the spring of 2025, the largest armed conflict in decades between the two countries occurred – the so-called “12-Day War.” Following a series of mutual attacks, including a massive Iranian missile strike on Israeli military sites in the Negev and a retaliatory Israeli campaign targeting Iranian air defense systems, nuclear facilities, and command centers, the conflict was halted through US and Qatari mediation. Nonetheless, it made clear that Israel is prepared for an open military scenario in pursuit of its strategic objective – the dismantling of Iran's regional network of influence. In this way, Israel is acting not only in the name of national defense but also as the initiator of a sweeping transformation of the Middle East power balance.

It is worth noting that the actions of the Israeli leadership, especially in recent months, have not always found full approval within Donald Trump's administration. Despite a long-standing alliance and ideological proximity, Prime Minister Netanyahu has increasingly placed Washington in an awkward position. Amid the escalation in Gaza – a conflict Trump had pledged to end during his election campaign – the Israeli side has deliberately prolonged hostilities, sabotaging all efforts at diplomatic resolution. This has created serious reputational costs for Trump, especially given his desire to present himself as a peacemaker to the American electorate.

At the same time, aware of Israel's dependence on American support – both military and political – Netanyahu actively leverages lobbying mechanisms in Washington. Through pro-Israel advocacy groups and allies within Trump's circle, he has been able to steer the White House toward decisions that serve his interests. A vivid example was the events of the 12-Day War with Iran, during which, despite internal disagreements within the US administration, Washington conducted airstrikes on Iranian nuclear infrastructure. This marked a critical turning point, effectively dragging Washington into direct military confrontation with Tehran – in defiance of the more cautious stance held by parts of the American strategic community.

In addition, Israeli authorities have advanced another controversial initiative, which has already sparked backlash even within the US: the idea of relocating the Palestinian population from Gaza and transforming the coastal strip into a tourism and infrastructure project known as the “Gaza Riviera.” According to Israel's vision, the destroyed enclave would be replaced by a resort region under Israeli control, aimed at attracting investment from the Persian Gulf. 

Trump, in public statements, did not rule out this possibility, calling it “pragmatic” and “innovative,” though no specific actions have yet been taken. Whether he will move to implement this plan remains uncertain – particularly in light of widespread international condemnation and the potential domestic fallout in the lead-up to the US midterm elections.

The relationship between Israel and the US is increasingly marked by complexity and asymmetry: West Jerusalem continues to pursue its goals, even at the risk of straining ties with its closest ally, while Washington, despite growing fatigue with the conflict, remains reluctant to openly confront Netanyahu.

Israeli authorities are systematically and deliberately pursuing the final elimination of the Palestinian issue while simultaneously seeking to weaken all regional competitors – from Iran and Türkiye to various militant groups, including Hezbollah and the Houthis. Military force, diplomatic pressure, lobbying, and propaganda are all employed as part of a comprehensive strategy aimed at the full occupation of Palestinian territories and consolidation of control over the West Bank and Gaza. Despite international condemnation, mass destruction, a humanitarian catastrophe, and violations of international law, Israel's leadership continues to push forward with its long-term objective – to establish Israel as the unchallenged regional power in the Middle East.

However, the implementation of this strategy remains uncertain. First, there is no consensus among Western capitals – including Washington – on the Palestinian issue: parts of the political establishment advocate a restrained approach and the preservation of the two-state solution.

Second, Israel's increasingly aggressive actions are fueling growing resentment among Arab states, intensifying confrontations with Iran and Türkiye, and pushing the region toward large-scale escalation.

Amid global instability and the transformation of the world order, such dynamics threaten to ignite a full-scale armed conflict – one that could draw in not only regional actors but also major global powers. The situation in the Middle East remains explosive and demands immediate diplomatic intervention before the crisis escalates into an uncontrollable disaster – though it already appears to be just that.

Moscow and Kiev have agreed for Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet with Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky, according to Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan. His remarks came shortly after the latest round of bilateral negotiations facilitated by Ankara.

The third round of direct peace talks took place on Wednesday in Istanbul. While no ceasefire was reached, the parties made some progress on humanitarian issues, including agreements on the further exchange of prisoners of war and civilians.

“During the meeting, leaders discussed the conditions under which they might come together,” Fidan told Turkish broadcaster NTV on Friday, noting that “a summit between the leaders in Türkiye was agreed upon in principle.”

Earlier in the week, Fidan described the Istanbul talks as another step toward ending the conflict, emphasizing that “every new achievement brings the sides one step closer to peace.”

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed that a potential meeting between Putin and Zelensky is being considered, but stressed that it should only take place at the final stage of peace negotiations. He added that such a summit is “unlikely” to happen within a month.

Russia maintains that it is open to a diplomatic solution, but only one that addresses what it calls the “root causes” of the war and Moscow's security concerns.

Zelensky has long called for a personal meeting with Putin. Ukraine's negotiators reiterated the proposal in Istanbul this week, saying that a one-on-one summit was a key step toward ending the fighting. US President Donald Trump has also voiced support for direct talks between the two leaders as part of a broader push to resolve the conflict. Moscow has never ruled out the possibility, but insists that the necessary groundwork must first be established.

Russia has questioned Zelensky's legitimacy, citing the expiration of his five-year term in May 2024. Zelensky has refused to hold new elections, citing martial law. Russian officials argue that any agreements signed under his authority could potentially be contested.

The Kremlin has also demanded that Ukraine lift martial law and hold elections within 100 days as a condition for any long-term ceasefire.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has suffered a major blow in terms of public support over the past month, with 56% of people disapproving of his work, a survey conducted by INSA institute shows. Less than a third of respondents said they are still satisfied with his leadership.

In early June, the level of support for Merz stood at 36%, with 45% of Germans critical of his performance, according to the German tabloid Bild, which commissioned the poll. The governing coalition, which includes Merz's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Social Democrats, has also taken a beating, according to the poll.

Almost 60% of Germans are not satisfied with the coalition's work, up from just 44% in early June, the data suggests. The two parties would no longer be able to form a majority government if elections were held this weekend, with the CDU getting 27% of the vote and the Social Democrats gaining 15%, according to INSA.

Germany's most popular opposition party – the right-wing Alterative for Germany (AfD) – is polling just three percentage points behind the CDU, the poll suggested.

Since taking office in May, Merz has adopted a hardline foreign policy stance towards Russia. Berlin – one of Kiev's largest backers – has pledged to provide €5 billion ($5.6 billion) to finance long-range weapons production in Ukraine. The chancellor also did not rule out providing long-range missiles capable of striking Moscow. Merz declared that diplomatic options in the Ukraine conflict were “exhausted” earlier this month.

The chancellor's statements prompted Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to accuse him of choosing escalation instead of diplomacy.

The federal government's spending priorities have sparked criticism at home. “Nobody understands that anymore,” AfD co-chair Alice Weidel said this week, referring to Berlin's decision to funnel taxpayers' money into weapons for Kiev while leaving domestic needs being unmet.

BUDAPEST, July 26. /TASS/. The threat of a third world war keeps growing, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said, adding that the international community should do everything it can to prevent it.

""Perhaps the most important question now is whether there will be a third world war, and the answer is that the likelihood of a world war is constantly increasing,"" he said in an address broadcast by the M1 TV channel.

As evidence, Orban cited the results of polls in six major countries, whose citizens consider the threat of a new world war to be quite real. The opinion that ""in 5-10 years a third world war will break out is held by 55% of the French, 50% of the Spanish, 46% of the Italians, 45% of the Americans, 41% of the British, and 41% of the Germans,"" the premier added."" ""The whole world feels the cold wind of war,"" he noted.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, July 26. /TASS/. It can no longer be denied that a default has occurred in Ukraine, Viktor Medvedchuk, former leader of Ukraine's banned Opposition Platform - For Life party who now heads the Another Ukraine movement, said in an interview with TASS.

""After Kiev failed to make loan payments on June 2, 2025, the S&P international agency immediately lowered its issue rating on Ukraine's GDP-linked securities to D (default) from CC (currently highly vulnerable). Now, there is not a single Western expert in economy and investment denying an actual default in Ukraine,"" the politician pointed out.

""Ukraine's official announcement of a default would not only mean that the country can no longer pay its debts but also that it is unable to fight,"" Medvedchuk noted. According to him, this is the reason why ""a large share of the Western political elite is much interested in pretending that there is no default in Ukraine."".","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

State authorities say suspect in custody and investigation under way into stabbing at  Traverse City store

Authorities in Michigan are investigating after multiple people were stabbed at a Walmart in Traverse City, police said on Saturday.

The Michigan state police said in a social media post that a suspect is in custody and the local sheriff's office is investigating the incident. The agency asked that people avoid the area while the investigation is ongoing.

A Walmart corporate spokesperson, Joe Pennington, said by email that the company was “working with police and defer questions to them right now”.

Lt Michelle Robinson, the public information officer for the Michigan state police's sixth district, confirmed to the Detroit News that a person was taken into police custody but could not give details on the number of people stabbed.

Munson Healthcare, a medical center in Traverse City, posted on social media saying 11 people were being treated at that hospital. The hospital requested patience and understanding from the public as “our emergency department is currently experiencing a higher-than-usual volume of patients”.

“Our thoughts are with all those affected by this event, and we are grateful to the first responders and law enforcement for their swift action,” the post read.

Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer posted on social media that she was aware of the incident and in touch with law enforcement. She wrote: “Our thoughts are with the victims and the community reeling from this brutal act of violence. I am grateful to the first responders for their swift response to apprehend the suspect.”

Traverse City is about 255 miles (410km) north-west of Detroit.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Venezuelans back home under Maduro-Trump deal tell of isolation, beatings and dirty water – ‘a living nightmare'  

Venezuelans that the Trump administration expelled to El Salvador's most notorious megaprison endured “state-sanctioned torture”, lawyers for some of the men have said, as more stories emerge about the horrors they faced during capacity.

When José Manuel Ramos Bastidas – one of 252 Venezuelan men that the US sent to El Salvador's most notorious mega-prison – finally made it back home to El Tocuyo on Tuesday, the first thing he did was stretch his arms around his family.

His wife, son and mother were wearing the bright blue shirts they had printed with a photo of him, posed in a yellow and black moto jacket and camo-print jeans. It was the first time they had hugged him since he left Venezuela last year. And it was the first time they could be sure – truly sure – that he was alive and well since he disappeared into the Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo (Cecot) in March.

“We have been waiting for this moment for months, and I feel like I can finally breathe,” said Roynerliz Rodríguez, Ramos Bastidas's partner. “These last months have been a living nightmare, not knowing anything about José Manuel and only imagining what he must be suffering. I am happy he is free from Cecot, but I also know that we will never be free of the shadow of this experience. There must be justice for all those who suffered this torture.”

The Venezuelan deportees were repatriated last week following a deal between the US and Venezuelan governments. Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan president, negotiated a prisoner swap that released 10 American citizens in his custody and dozens of Venezuelan political prisoners in exchange for the release of his citizens from Cecot.

This week, after undergoing medical and background checks, they are finally reuniting with their families. Their testimonies of what they experienced inside Cecot are providing the first, most detailed pictures of the conditions inside Cecot, a mega-prison that human rights groups say is designed to disappear people.

Ramos Bastidas and other US deportees were told that they were condemned to spend 30 to 90 years in Cecot unless the US president ordered otherwise, he told his lawyers. They were shot with rubber bullets on repeated occasions – including on Friday, during their last day of detention.

In interviews with the media and in testimony provided to their lawyers, other detainees described lengthy beatings and humiliation by guards. After some detainees tried to break the locks on their cell, prisoners were beaten for six consecutive days, the Atlantic reports. Male guards reportedly brought in female colleagues, who beat the naked prisoners and recorded videos.

Edicson David Quintero Chacón, a US deportee, said that he was placed in isolation for stretches of time, during which he thought he would die, his lawyer told the Guardian. Quintero Chacón, who has scars from daily beatings, also said that he and other inmates were only provided soap and an opportunity to bathe on days when visitors were touring the prison – forcing them to choose between hygiene and public humiliation.

Food was limited, and the drinking water was dirty, Quintero Chacón and other detainees have said. Lights were on all night, so detainees could never fully rest. “And the guards would also come in at night and beat them at night,” said his lawyer Stephanie M Alvarez-Jones, the south-east regional attorney at the National Immigration Project.

In a filing asking for a dismissal of her months-long petition on behalf of her clients' release, Alvarez-Jones wrote: “He will likely carry the psychological impact of this torture his whole life. The courts must never look away when those who wield the power of the US government, at the highest levels, engage in such state-sanctioned violence.”

Ramos Bastidas has never been convicted of any crimes in the US (or in any country). In fact, he had never really set foot in the US as a free man.

In El Tocuyo, in the Venezuelan state of Lara, and had been working since he was a teenager to support his family. Last year, he decided to leave his country – which has yet to recover from an economic collapse – to seek better income, so he could pay for medical care for his infant with severe asthma.

In March 2024, he arrived at the US-Mexico border and presented himself at a port of entry. He made an appointment using the now-defunct CBP One phone application to apply for asylum – but immigration officials and a judge determined that he did not qualify.

But Customs and Border Protection agents had flagged Ramos Bastidas as a possible member of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, based on an unsubstantiated report from Panamanian officials and his tattoos. So they transferred him to a detention facility, where he was to remain until he could be deported.

Despite agreeing to return to Venezuela, he remained for months in detention. “I think what is particularly enraging for José is that he had accepted his deportation,” said Alvarez-Jones. “He was asking for his deportation for a long time, and he just wanted to go back home.”

In December, Venezuela wasn't accepting deportees – so Ramos Bastidas asked if he could be released and make his own way home. A month later, Donald Trump was sworn in as president. Everything changed.

Ramos Bastidas began to see other Venezuelans were being sent to the military base in Guantánamo Bay in Cuba – and he feared the same would happen to him. On 14 March, he shared with his family that maybe he would be able to come back to Venezuela after all, after officials began prepping him for deportation.

The next day, he was flown to Cecot.

“They could have deported him to Venezuela,” Alvarez-Jones. “Instead, the US government made a determination to send him to be tortured in Cecot.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Animosity between former friends and political patriarchs Hun Sen and Thaksin Shinawatra is exacerbating clashes

The dispute over Thailand and Cambodia's contested border, which dates back more than a century to disagreements over colonial-era maps, has broken into conflict before. But the most recent clashes, which erupted on Thursday, have been fuelled by another factor: a bitter feud between two powerful political patriarchs.

Hun Sen, 72, and Thaksin Shinawatra, 76, former leaders of Cambodia and Thailand, were once such close friends they reportedly called one another brothers. Hun Sen has, over the years, supported Thaksin's family during their long-running power struggle with Thailand's military. Thaksin and his sister Yingluck stayed at Hun Sen's home after they were ousted from power, while Hun Sen appointed Thaksin an economic adviser to the Cambodian government. Thaksin frequently visited Cambodia, and Hun Sen was the first foreign guest to see the former Thai leader after he returned home after more than 15 years in self-imposed exile.

But relations have broken down spectacularly over recent months. The exact reasons for their feud are unclear, but analysts say it has created an additional layer of volatility that is exacerbating deadly clashes on the neighbouring countries' border.

Hun Sen and Thaksin are no longer in office in their respective countries, but both remain powerful. Hun Sen ruled for almost 40 years until 2003, when his eldest son Hun Manet became prime minister after running virtually uncontested in a sham election. Thaksin's daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra became prime minister last year.

The extent of their falling out became clear last month, when Hun Sen leaked a recording of a phone conversation between himself and Paetongtarn.
  In the call, which was about the border dispute, Paetongtarn called Hun Sen “uncle” and told him if there was anything he wanted, she would “take care of it”. She also made disparaging comments about a senior Thai military commander.

The leaked recording caused uproar in Thailand. Critics accused her of kowtowing to Cambodia, putting her family connections before the country's national interests. She was suspended from office by the constitutional court in July pending an investigation into ethical violations.

It's not clear why Hun Sen chose to turn on his former friends. He has accused Thaksin of betrayal and threatened to reveal further sensitive information about the Shinawatras. “I never imagined someone so close could act this way,” Thaksin said later, declaring their friendship over.

Some analysts say Hun Sen may be trying to whip up nationalism domestically to increase support for his son, Hun Manet.

Others suggest Hun Sen has been angered by Thailand's efforts to crack down on so-called “scam compounds” where trafficked workers are held and forced to target people around the world with online scams. This form of lucrative criminal activity has proliferated in the region over recent years, especially in Cambodia.

“The popular narrative in Thailand is that the two men may have had some kind of personal dealings behind the scenes that did not go according to plan and the fallout has spilled over into the realm of national interest,” said Tita Sanglee, associate fellow with ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.

Whatever his motivations, Hun Sen has succeeded in damaging Thaksin's position, exploiting divisions between his family and the military, and creating a power vacuum in Thailand.

Hun Sen, meanwhile, “holds near absolute control in Cambodia”, adds Tita. He has stamped out virtually all opposition voices and independent media. “When he chooses to take a strong stance, militarily or politically, it has immediate and direct consequences.”

On Thursday night, Thaksin said he had thanked countries that had offered to mediate the border dispute, but would like to wait, adding: “We need to let the Thai military do their job, and first teach this cunning Hun Sen a lesson.”

Given Thaksin's weakened position, he may not have a choice but to let the military take the lead.

Last week Thailand downgraded it diplomatic relations with Cambodia, recalling its ambassador, and saying it would expel the country's envoy in Bangkok.

Thaksin has denied the families' feud was the cause of the clashes. However awkward questions about his friend turned foe are likely to continue.

As he visited communities sheltering from the conflict in Ubon Ratchathani, in northeastern Thailand, a woman confronted him: “You're Hun Sen's friend, aren't you? Is he your friend? Why do you allow Cambodia to shoot Thai people?”
 Solving territorial disagreements is difficult in any context, said Pavin Chachavalpongpun, professor at the Center for Southeast Asian Studies at Kyoto University. “No country would like to sacrifice any inch of sovereignty,” he said. But the personal conflict between Hun Sen and Thaksin has, he added, made their countries' dispute even more unpredictable.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

When Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) caucus whip Ker Chien-ming (柯建銘) first suggested a mass recall of Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) legislators, the Taipei Times called the idea “not only absurd, but also deeply undemocratic” (“Lai's speech and legislative chaos,” Jan. 6, page 8).

In a subsequent editorial (“Recall chaos plays into KMT hands,” Jan. 9, page 8), the paper wrote that his suggestion was not a solution, and that if it failed, it would exacerbate the enmity between the parties and lead to a cascade of revenge recalls.

The danger came from having the DPP orchestrate a mass recall. As it transpired, civic groups and concerned voters took the idea and ran with it, initiating an unprecedented drive that Taiwan should be proud of. 

Each one of yesterday's 24 recall votes against KMT legislators failed, as did the one against suspended Hsinchu Mayor Ann Kao (高虹安) of the Taiwan People's Party (TPP), and yet the recall movement can still be held up as a victory for democracy, because of the scale of the mobilization. Victory in defeat, because sometimes the other candidate wins: It is the process that counts. 

The process was driven from the bottom up, and recalls are a necessary democratic mechanism. However, the process itself might have disaffected many voters. It is possible that many would have voted “no” not because they supported the legislator representing their constituency, but because they supported the principle of terms of elected office, and felt uneasy about wresting an elected lawmaker from their seat in a mass recall so soon after last year's legislative election. 

Another element is that the recall motions were fighting an uphill battle, as they were — by definition — only being held in blue-leaning districts where the KMT had won just 18 months ago. 

If anger over the mass recall contributed to yesterday's failure, it leaves room for lingering frustration with the KMT's disruptive, unconstitutional and suspiciously China-friendly actions in the legislature. This resentment could play a role in the next legislative elections, particularly if the KMT-TPP opposition fails to change tack.

KMT Chairman Eric Chu (朱立倫) might be elated with yesterday's results, but he would be unwise to be emboldened by them. He should take note of the groundswell of voter anger at the direction in which he has taken the opposition, but it is doubtful he will. 

This is evident from the KMT and TPP's decision, on the eve of the recall vote, to reject all seven of President William Lai's (賴清德) grand justice nominees for the Constitutional Court — the second time in six months that all nominees have been rejected. 

This blanket rejection, which would hobble the proper functioning of the nation's constitutional system, is yet another example of the KMT's willingness to prioritize party interests — possibly even Beijing's agenda — over the national interest, and another reason voters are so alarmed by the opposition's behavior.

It seems that Chu continues to believe his absurd claims that the recall movement was the result of a dictatorial president overseeing an authoritarian government, rather than reflecting the genuine concerns of large segments of the electorate.

Unfortunately, given yesterday's results and Chu's deafness to what the voters are telling him, the future appears to hold more chaos, only exacerbated by calls for retributive recalls against the DPP. 

Ker's desire for an easy way out of his challenges in the legislature have been dashed. The DPP cannot expect any good news from the seven more recalls, scheduled for Aug. 23, for the same reasons that yesterday's foundered. 

Chu would likely be emboldened, but it might be time for Lai to take off the gloves and adopt a more proactive approach against the opposition.



                                                                                A failure by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to respond to Israel's brilliant 12-day (June 12-23) bombing and special operations war against Iran, topped by US President Donald Trump's ordering the June 21 bombing of Iranian deep underground nuclear weapons fuel processing sites, has been noted by some as demonstrating a profound lack of resolve, even “impotence,” by China.
However, this would be a dangerous underestimation of CCP ambitions and its broader and more profound military response to the Trump Administration — a challenge that includes an acceleration of its strategies to assist nuclear proxy states, and developing a wide array                                    



                                                                                Jaw Shaw-kong (趙少康), former chairman of Broadcasting Corp of China and leader of the “blue fighters,” recently announced that he had canned his trip to east Africa, and he would stay in Taiwan for the recall vote on Saturday. He added that he hoped “his friends in the blue camp would follow his lead.”
His statement is quite interesting for a few reasons. Jaw had been criticized following media reports that he would be traveling in east Africa during the recall vote. While he decided to stay in Taiwan after drawing a lot of flak, his hesitation says it all: If                                    



                                                                                Twenty-four Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) lawmakers are facing recall votes on Saturday, prompting nearly all KMT officials and lawmakers to rally their supporters over the past weekend, urging them to vote “no” in a bid to retain their seats and preserve the KMT's majority in the Legislative Yuan.
The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had largely kept its distance from the civic recall campaigns, earlier this month instructed its officials and staff to support the recall groups in a final push to protect the nation. The justification for the recalls has increasingly been framed as a “resistance” movement against China and                                    



                                                                                Owing to the combined majority of the opposition Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) and Taiwan People's Party (TPP), the legislature last week voted to further extend the current session to the end of next month, prolonging the session twice for a total of 211 days, the longest in Taiwan's democratic history.
Legally, the legislature holds two regular sessions annually: from February to May, and from September to December. The extensions pushed by the opposition in May and last week mean there would be no break between the first and second sessions this year.
While the opposition parties said the extensions were needed to                                    ","{'href': 'https://www.taipeitimes.com', 'title': 'Taipei Times'}","world"

Taiwan's Chou Tien-chen yesterday exited in the semi-finals at the China Open in Changzhou, beaten by the world's No. 2 player in men's singles badminton.

Chou, who is ranked No. 6 in the world, was eliminated 21-13, 22-20 by Shi Yuqi of China, despite the Taiwanese claiming healthy leads in both games.

The 35-year-old Chou, who on Friday beat world No. 1 Kunlavut Vitidsarn of Thailand at the Olympic Sports Center Gymnasium in the quarter-finals, shot to a 6-2 lead in game 1, but his Chinese opponent eroded the advantage and took the lead at 12-11. From there, Shi conceded only two further points in the game.

In game 2, Chou did not concede ground so lightly. He was up 8-4, 11-8 and 15-12, with each lead a response to Shi having leveled the scores.

However, from 15-12 Shi stormed to an 18-15 lead before wrapping up the match in 45 minutes to take his head-to-head record against Chou to 13-5.

Yankees star Aaron Judge was the last player to homer in five consecutive games, accomplishing that feat last year.
Ohtani, who leads the National League with 37 home runs, homered in the first inning off Minnesota Twins starter Chris Paddack. He hit a slow curveball 134m to center. He carried the bat midway down the first-base line and then did a bat flip.
He did not hit a home run later in the game with the Dodgers trailing, but his presence was felt. With two outs

With just three stages left before the race ends in Paris, Pogacar looks poised to retain his title, with a comfortable lead of more than 4 minutes over Vingegaard, a two-time champion.
Stage 18 featured three extremely difficult ascents, including the 26.4km climb of the Col de La Loze to the finish. At 2,304m, La Loze is the highest summit in this year's Tour.

It was former world No. 2 Chou's eighth win in 14 matches against Prannoy, who had earlier this week lamented the age divide between him and up-and-comers, although he is only two years younger than 35-year-old Chou.
The Taiwanese, who is seeded sixth at the tournament, rebounded from a close 21-18 loss in game 1 on Court 2 at the Olympic Sports Center Gymnasium.
He bounced back to take the next games 21-15, 21-8 and set up a tough quarter-final

Russia will reinforce its Black Sea Fleet with marine robotic systems, warships, and additional aircraft, Nikolai Patrushev, the head of Russia's Maritime Collegium, said in an interview with the state-run RIA Novosti published on July 25. 

""In the coming years, the Black Sea sailors will be further strengthened — with the arrival of new frigates, corvettes, aviation, marine robotic complexes,"" Patrushev said. 

The Black Sea Fleet, headquartered in Sevastopol since Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, has suffered significant losses during the war against Ukraine. 

Ukrainian missile and drone strikes have forced the Kremlin to relocate part of the fleet away from occupied Crimea, reducing its operational presence in the region.

Despite these setbacks, Patrushev emphasized the fleet's strategic importance, claiming it remains critical for countering NATO and continuing military operations against Ukraine.

Ukraine has destroyed or disabled at least 29 Russian vessels, according to the Ukrainian General Staff. Among the most notable losses are the fleet's flagship, the Moskva, sunk in April 2022, the Caesar Kunikov and Sergei Kotov, along with numerous smaller landing crafts.

In June, Russian President Vladimir Putin approved a new naval doctrine aimed at restoring Russia's status as a global maritime power.

Patrushev, 74, a longtime ally of Putin and often described as the architect of Russia's war against Ukraine, has held influential positions in Russia's security apparatus for decades. 

He previously served as the secretary of the Security Council and was reportedly a key advocate for launching the full-scale invasion in 2022.

Russia's navy remains the third most powerful in the world, according to public assessments, but the full-scale war has exposed vulnerabilities in its Black Sea operations, where Ukraine has managed to push back one of the Kremlin's most prized military assets.

Ukrainian forces have pushed back Russian troops in Sumy Oblast, disrupting Moscow's attempts to expand its foothold in the region, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on July 26.

Russia opened a new front in Sumy Oblast in early June, capturing around a dozen border villages. The push followed Russian President Vladimir Putin's May declaration that Moscow aimed to create a ""security buffer zone"" along Ukraine's northeastern border. 

""Although this region remains one of the priority areas for the enemy, our forces consistently block Russian attempts to advance deeper into Sumy Oblast from the border,"" Zelensky wrote following a report from Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi.

""I thanked the Commander-in-Chief for managing to thwart the Russian plan for the Sumy region. Our active actions in Sumy Oblast continue, and I am grateful to each unit that is gradually pushing the Russian forces out.""

The president's statement came after the battlefield tracking group DeepState reported on July 25 that Ukrainian forces had liberated the village of Kindrativka near the Russian border.

Zelensky warned in May that a 50,000-strong Russian force was massing near the oblast. Syrskyi said last month that Ukraine had managed to pin down this grouping and halt its progress, describing the Russian advance as ""faltering.""

Sumy Oblast has been a key target for Russian forces throughout the full-scale invasion due to its location on the northeastern frontier. It continues to face near-daily strikes, but Ukrainian forces have maintained control over most of the region.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko is again using his country's territory to funnel illegal migrants from Africa, the Middle East, and Afghanistan toward the European Union, Ukraine's Foreign Intelligence Service said on July 26. 

According to the agency, Lukashenko is facilitating transit primarily to Poland, with some migrants arriving from Libya directly or through Russia — pointing to coordinated efforts between Minsk and Moscow.

This mirrors tactics used in 2021, when Belarus orchestrated mass migrant crossings into EU states in what Brussels condemned as a form of hybrid warfare. The effort was widely seen as an attempt to blackmail the bloc into easing sanctions on Lukashenko's regime.

""This blackmail did not work,"" Ukraine's intelligence service said, noting that the response instead intensified Belarus' diplomatic isolation.

While Lukashenko reportedly profits from the migrant flows, he has so far avoided full-scale escalation, likely in an effort to preserve his few remaining political ties in Europe. 

Hungary, which has taken a hard line against illegal migration, has remained one of the few EU states maintaining dialogue with Minsk.

""Lukashenko, despite his reputation as a satellite of Russia's dictator Vladimir Putin, retains autonomy in matters of tactics — and once again demonstrates a willingness to use it to exert political pressure on the West,"" the agency said.

Poland, one of the EU's front-line states, has long accused Belarus and Russia of waging a hybrid war by deliberately directing migrants toward its borders. 

Warsaw reported stopping 26,000 illegal crossing attempts in 2024 alone. One soldier was killed and 63 others injured in related border clashes.

Polish officials have pointed to a growing number of migrants carrying Russian visas, linking the wave directly to the Kremlin's broader confrontation with the West.

Lukashenko has ruled Belarus since 1994 and remains a key ally of the Kremlin. His regime has allowed Russian troops and equipment to use Belarusian territory to attack Ukraine at the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022.

For years the U.S. stock market sucked the air out of the world's markets. At its peak, it accounted for more than half of the world's publicly-traded capital. But now, money has begun returning home.ANGELA WEISS/AFP/Getty Images

John Rapley is a contributing columnist for The Globe and Mail. He is an author and academic whose books include Why Empires Fall and Twilight of the Money Gods.

Stock markets are probing fresh heights. Among the G7 economies, only Italy's isn't in record territory and even Japan, which looked to have entered terminal decline after its 1990 crash, is now back within touching distance of those long-ago highs. House prices as well are near their all-time highs in most places, slightly off their recent peaks but still far above where they ever were before. And that's nothing compared with crypto and gold – bitcoin is up more than a quarter this year, gold nearly a third.

In short, we're getting richer by the day. Which is kind of strange, because our economies are barely moving. Of the major economies, only the United States has shown any significant expansion recently and even that is now slowing rapidly. Reflecting this new deceleration, the corporate-earnings season now under way in the United States is turning out to be a dud, with profit growth coming in well below the rate of share-price increases. 

In short, the strength of market rallies doesn't reflect what's happening in economies, which are weak and getting weaker. So what's going on?

Some of it is rebalancing. Talk of all-time highs in the U.S. stock market cloud the reality – the U.S. is the laggard, it's stock market up a mere 5 per cent since President Donald Trump took office and 8 per cent for the year, a far cry from Germany's 22 per cent or Hong Kong's 28 per cent. Currency effects make the discrepancy even more dramatic, leaving the U.S. market down in euro and peso terms, and pretty much flat in Canadian dollars.

Lofty U.S. stock valuations bank on tech-heavy market's earnings strength

For years the U.S. stock market sucked the air out of the world's markets. At its peak, it accounted for more than half of the world's publicly traded capital, the Magnificent Seven tech stocks alone having a combined value bigger than any other stock market on the planet. But now, money has begun returning home. That explains the weakening of the dollar. Given how much smaller than the U.S. these markets are, flows of this scale have an outsized impact on prices. As a result, the laggards of the past decade, such as Spain, Hong Kong, South Africa and Britain, have become winners, with a small share of repatriated investment making for big rallies.

This rebalancing was always bound to happen at some point, but Mr. Trump's policies are accelerating it. Though presenting the trade “deals” he's now rolling out as wins, because other countries have to “pay” higher tariffs than the U.S., it's an odd victory when your consumers must pay more for their goods than foreigners. After Mr. Trump announced his trade deal with Japan this week, Toyota's share price shot up 15 per cent, but Ford's barely budged. That's because the price of a Toyota car will increase by 15 per cent, but Ford's will probably rise more, since the company must pay tariffs on all its inputs.

The same is happening in bond markets, where the spread between U.S. government bonds and those of other countries, especially emerging markets, is narrowing. As the U.S. looks less investable, other countries lure capital back away from it.

To this reallocation of investment one can add the massive amount of stimulus now entering the global pipeline – the tax cuts in Mr. Trump's Big Beautiful Bill, Germany's big stimulus program, NATO's rearmament, Japan's fiscal loosening: There's a lot of bond issuance coming, which will pump money into the world economy. The monetary tightening that had followed the 2021-22 inflation spike has now given way to an increase in global money supply that's running at an annual rate of more than 7 per cent.

Opinion: The triple contradiction of Trumponomics could crash the world economy

But what's good for markets isn't necessarily good for the economy. In the U.S., first-time homebuyers are spending a higher share of their income on mortgage payments today than they were before the 2008 crash, leaving less to spend or invest on other things, while squeezing future demand. The same is happening in Canada, and as we know one consequence of the rising cost of living is that voters are demanding a reduction in immigration. If voters don't always favour the harsh measures being taken against immigrants in the U.S., nonetheless virtually all Western countries are starting to clamp down on inflows. That is cutting off one of the few remaining sources of growth in Western economies, namely the rise in labour supply.

Sooner or later, in short, markets will realign with the economy. Unless the latter picks up, the former are sure to fall. At the moment, a slowdown looks the more likely scenario. Whatever stimulus effects come from government's fiscal largesse, the impact of tariffs and slow growth in the labour market owing to immigration cutbacks will drag down growth. Investors are still pricing shares as if the good days will keep rolling. But this fall may bring a chill to markets.

Andy Filipowich is a high school teacher by day, but a prolific Wikipedia editor by night.Galit Rodan/The Globe and Mail

The bronze bust of William Lyon Mackenzie sits on a tall plinth tucked away in Toronto's Queen's Park. He has a defiant expression, befitting the rebel leader against Upper Canada, and a swooping hairdo that looks like a bird perched atop his head. 

Earlier this summer, Andy Filipowich was here to take in the statue. He's a high school teacher by day, but a prolific Wikipedia editor by night. 

The 36-year-old is one of the editors of Mackenzie's Wikipedia page, whose meticulous writing and citing led the article to be featured on the website's front page – arguably one of the highest distinctions for a Wikipedia editor. That day, more than 25,000 people read the article.

“You can only stumble upon it if you're physically in the space,” Mr. Filipowich says about the statue. “But in the online world, anyone can stumble on any information.”

Since Wikipedia was founded nearly a quarter of a century ago, fortified by co-founder Jimmy Wales's goal to “help the internet not suck,” it has consistently ranked as one of the top 10 most visited websites worldwide. 

Free of ads and profit-seeking corporate overlords, and maintained by dedicated volunteers, Wikipedia is arguably one of the last best places on the internet.

In any given month, Wikipedia gets more than four billion page views globally, but only a tiny sliver of those visitors will actually make edits to the website. An army of volunteers writes and edits article pages, removes vandalism and misinformation, and adds citations. The internet runs on these kinds of quiet acts of online altruism: the unsung heroes who upload fresh menus on Google, moderate Reddit forums, or post honest product reviews on Amazon amid the flood of fake ones. 

Over the past two decades, Wikipedia has faced various threats, including censorship from hostile governments and nefarious sock puppet accounts hijacking articles. But every time, the website has fought back and adapted to the changing tides of the internet. Now, however, it faces an existential threat. Editors are fearful that as more people use AI chatbots such as ChatGPT or Gemini to find information, they won't need Wikipedia. 

For Mr. Filipowich, and the more than hundred thousand active editors, the survival of Wikipedia has never been more important. 

Andy Filipowich's first big project was overhauling William Lyon Mackenzie's Wikipedia page.Galit Rodan/The Globe and Mail

A Canadian history buff, Mr. Filipowich has been an active editor since 2020. While sitting at home during COVID lockdown, he clicked the “random article” button on Wikipedia's main page and landed on a gas explosion in Toronto's Etobicoke neighbourhood in the early 2000s. The article didn't have much information, so he started adding new details. He caught the bug, as he describes it, and kept editing other Wikipedia articles. 

Mr. Filipowich's first big project was overhauling Mackenzie's page to bring it up to “featured article” status, which Wikipedia considers the best work on the site and only grants to 0.1 per cent of all articles. For a year, he read multiple biographies, dug through newspaper archives and made tweaks based on feedback from other editors. 

Hannah Clover, a 22-year-old from the Niagara region in Ontario, started editing Wikipedia when she was in high school. At 16, she created the page for Canadian journalist and archivist Katherine Hughes, which was featured on Wikipedia's front page in the “Did you know” section. “I was completely ecstatic the whole day,” says Ms. Clover. “I kept refreshing the main page and going, ‘I wrote that one sentence!'”

Earlier this year, she wrote Wikipedia's first article ever on ketchup chips, excavating every mention she could find of the food in newspaper archives and reading a book about the history of Canadian snacks. She writes book plot summaries, too, as well as descriptions of landmarks in the Niagara region. When she discovered the Niagara Falls Public Library didn't have a photo on its article page, she hiked around the city, snapping shots of every branch to add to the website's licence-free media archive. Last year, Ms. Clover was named “Wikimedian of the year,” an annual award that honours an editor's contributions. 

How Wikipedia became one of the greatest achievements of the modern age

For Ms. Clover, part of her motivation is the community she's built. She's made a lot of friends on Wikipedia, finding kinship with fellow nerds who are happy to geek out about the credibility of sources and discuss ways to improve the website. 

“A big part of what makes me stay is the community, because people get me. It's like a bunch of bookworms everywhere,” she says. 

That sense of community is also what keeps Enoch Leung, 27, volunteering with Wikipedia. He started editing when he was 12, and over the next couple years, began working on some of the maintenance aspects of Wikipedia, such as monitoring new edits for vandalism. He's attended meetups with other Toronto-based editors, including recently visiting the Toronto Islands to take photos for Wikimedia Commons. 

“In a world where the internet feels increasingly dystopian as algorithms dictate what we see and think … it's refreshing to be part of a website that isn't any of that – and perhaps a little intimidating too,” says Mr. Leung. 

Wikipedia is not without its flaws. There's a stark gender gap among its editors – about 80 per cent are men – and in its content too, with women accounting for only 20 per cent of biographical entries. Wikipedia has also been accused of both being too conservative and too progressive. Earlier this year, Elon Musk said it's “an extension of legacy media propaganda” and called for the website to be “defunded.”

But the biggest concern right now is AI chatbots. 

People are increasingly using chatbots to seek out information they would have once found on Wikipedia. (Ironically the website is one of the most widely used data sources for AI training models owing to its open licence.) Some editors and researchers worry fewer people will visit the website directly. And that means fewer opportunities to attract potential new editors – the lifeblood of the platform. 

Opinion: Elon Musk's hate for Wikipedia reveals his true views on free speech

“Wikipedia is this economic anomaly. In many ways, it's sort of magical that people will just volunteer without explicit economic incentives to create artifacts that are meant to share knowledge with everyone in the world,” says Nicholas Vincent, an assistant professor at Simon Fraser University who has studied how Wikipedia helps support Google searches. “And so fundamentally anything that threatens to cut off traffic to the actual Wikipedia platform threatens all those things.” 

Mr. Filipowich, the high school teacher, is concerned that Wikipedia could become a relic of the past if overall readership declines. But he's also hopeful that Wikipedia can find ways to use AI to grow as a site, such as using it to translate articles into other languages. It may just take time to figure out what those best-use cases are. 

“I remember going through school and Wikipedia being the new big scary thing in education,” Mr. Filipowich says. “AI has become the new form of that, and I just think it's because we don't quite know how to use it yet.” 

Dr. Vincent says there are ways in which tech companies like OpenAI and Google can help prevent the deterioration of Wikipedia, including by changing the design of their chatbots to encourage users to click through to the website.

Ms. Clover is concerned about AI slop infiltrating the website, how the chatbots can make up information, including sources, and how that could lead to a greater distrust online. However, she's not too worried about AI leading to a decline in editors. 

Over Google Meet, she pulls up a graph showing the change in the frequency of edits from 2006 to 2020. The line is remarkably consistent throughout the past 14 years. 

“And how different is the world compared to how it was in 2006? I think we'll get through this.” 

Walking around Queen's Park earlier this summer, Mr. Filipowich was quick to pull out his phone and look up facts on Wikipedia – how old Mackenzie was when he died (66) or to confirm the alibi of a former Toronto mayor accused of being at the Upper Canada Rebellion (he wouldn't be wearing sunglasses at night, like his accuser claimed). 

The statues dotted throughout the park also served as reminders of Mr. Filipowich's to-do list of articles he wants to update. His current big project is the page of George Brown, the 19th century politician and founder of The Globe, to featured article status. He's about three-quarters through one of Brown's two-volume biographies. The work of the Wikipedia editor never ends.

Chinese Premier Li Qiang warned that without a global consensus AI could become an ""exclusive game"" for a few countries and companies. It comes days after US President Donald Trump unveiled plans to slash regulations.

Chinese Premier Li Qiang on Saturday urged the international community to build a global consensus on artificial intelligence (AI) governance, highlighting security risks amid the raging tech race between Beijing and Washington.

Speaking at the opening of the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) in Shanghai, Li said it is prudent to look at ""how to find a balance between development and security [which] urgently requires further consensus from the entire society.""

Li also announced the creation of a Chinese-led body to promote global AI cooperation and open-source development to keep AI from becoming ""the preserve of a few countries and a few enterprises.""

The three-day WAIC event comes amid intensifying US-China competition in advanced AI technology.

Just days before, US President Donald Trump announced the slashing of AI regulations to maintain the US' dominance in the field even as Washington continues to restrict exports of high-end chips to China, citing national security concerns.

These restrictions are forcing Chinese companies to look for alternatives, with startup DeepSeek introducing an AI model in January that matched the performance of leading US systems, despite working on less advanced chips.

Li, without naming the US, criticized monopolistic control and called for open access to AI technologies, warning of insufficient supply of AI chips and restrictions on talent exchange otherwise.

""Only by adhering to openness, sharing and fairness in access to intelligence can more countries and groups benefit from (AI),"" he said.

At the WAIC opening ceremony, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a video message that AI regulation would be ""a defining test of international cooperation.""

More than 800 companies are participating in this year's WAIC, showcasing over 3,000 tech innovations.

While Chinese firms like Huawei and Alibaba are the main entrants, international firms including US-based companies Tesla, Alphabet, and Amazon are also present.

The German state of Baden-Württemberg's deputy speaker stepped down after admitting he drew a swastika on a ballot beside an AfD lawmaker's name. Daniel Born said he had made a ""serious mistake"" during a vote.

The deputy speaker of the parliament in the southwestern state of Baden-Württemberg stepped down on Friday from his role after admitting he had drawn a swastika on a ballot paper next to the name of a far-right AfD lawmaker.

Center-left Social Democrat (SPD) politician Daniel Born made the transgression during a vote involving two Alternative for Germany (AfD) lawmakers.

In a statement, the Born said he had made a ""serious mistake"" during a ""momentary lapse.""

The incident happened during Thursday's election of deputy members to the cross-border Upper Rhine Council, a consultative body.

Two AfD lawmakers were on the ballot. A swastika was found on one of the ballots next to the name of AfD candidate Bernhard Eisenhut.

The news that someone had drawn a swastika prompted widespread outrage. Initially, it was unclear who had drawn the Nazi symbol.

State parliament president Muhterem Aras from the Green Party called the act a ""criminal offense,"" and the parliament filed a criminal complaint with police on Thursday evening, initially against an unknown perpetrator.

On Friday, Born said he would also step down from the SPD parliamentary group. However, Born stopped short of giving up his seat in parliament. 

""This was a serious error of judgment,"" he said. ""I deeply regret this and accept the consequences.""

""I made a serious mistake and in a moment of rash emotion drew a swastika behind the name of an AfD candidate,"" Born wrote in an email to other parliamentary leaders, quoted by public broadcaster SWR. ""I will never forgive myself for this failure.""

The swastika was the symbol of National Socialism and the party logo of the Nazi Party.

Whether marking a swastika on a ballot during a secret vote constitutes a prosecutable crime remains to be determined by investigators and possibly the courts. Under Germany's Criminal Code, the use of unconstitutional symbols can be punishable by up to three years in prison or a fine.

Born, 49, had been a member of parliament since 2016 and served as one of the legislature's vice presidents since 2021. He also acted as the SPD's spokesperson on religious affairs.

Explaining his actions, Born cited deep concern over the far-right AfD and its disruptive conduct during Thursday's vote. ""The speeches yesterday and the chaos caused by the AfD shook me deeply,"" he wrote. ""I was in a state of emotional distress and completely failed.""

Parliament president Aras spoke of a scandal and on Friday called on the ""person responsible"" to resign from their parliamentary seat.

""I have come to know Daniel Born as a passionate parliamentarian,"" said Aras. ""Nevertheless, I expect him to resign his seat as well.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Iran: At least 9 killed in attack on courthouse","https://www.dw.com/en/iran-at-least-9-killed-in-attack-on-courthouse/a-73421304","Sat, 26 Jul 2025 11:15:28 GMT","

The attack, blamed on the Sunni militant group Jaish al-Adl, took place at a court building in southeastern Sistan-Baluchistan province.

Nine people were killed Saturday when unknown assailants launched a gun and grenade attack at a courthouse in southeastern Iran, local media reported.

The assault happened in the province of Sistan-Baluchistan, near the borders with Pakistan and Afghanistan.

The province frequently sees clashes between security forces and armed groups, including the Sunni militant group Jaish al-Adl (Army of Justice), which has demanded greater rights and autonomy for Iran's ethnic Baloch.

State news agency IRNA reported that the attack targeted a courthouse in Zahedan, the capital of southeastern Sistan-Baluchistan province.

Zahedan lies some 1,130 kilometers (700 miles) southeast of the capital, Tehran.

The province's deputy police commander, Alireza Daliri, said the attackers attempted to enter the building disguised as visitors.

The assailants threw a grenade into the building, Daliri said, killing several people inside.

The dead included at least six civilians — including a mother and child — and three assailants, IRNA reported.

More than a dozen others were injured.

Citing eyewitnesses, the Baluch human rights group HAALVSH said several judiciary staff members and security personnel were killed or wounded.

IRNA said the three dead gunmen were killed in clashes with security forces following the attack.

The Iranian judiciary's Mizan Online news site labeled the killings a ""terrorist attack.""

Sistan-Baluchistan province is home to Iran's Baloch minority, who have long complained of economic marginalisation and political exclusion.

The province is one of the least developed parts of Iran. Baloch are typically Sunni Muslims, whereas Iran is majority Shiite.

The Baloch homeland extends into Pakistan's southwestern Balochistan province, where residents have expressed similar grievances of economic marginalization and where the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) militant group has carried out numerous attacks.

The semiofficial Tasnim news agency blamed the attack on the militant group Jaish al-Adl.

The group, which is composed mainly of ethnic Baloch members, is known for its violent attacks against Iranian security forces.

Jaish al-Adl, which emerged in 2012, aims to secure greater rights and independence for the Baloch people in Iran.

In a statement posted on its Telegram account, the group took responsibility for the attack.

The statement urged ""all civilians to immediately evacuate the area of clashes for their safety.""

In January 2024, Jaish al-Adl claimed to have assassinated three Revolutionary Guards officials, including Colonel Hossein-Ali Javdanfar, commander of the Sistan-Baluchistan Corps of the Quds Force.

A few months later, the group launched coordinated attacks in the cities of Chabahar, Rask, and Sarbaz, targeting IRGC, naval, intelligence, and police facilities.

Twenty-one security personnel and 18 militants were killed.

The Iranian government accuses the group of ties to foreign powers and involvement in cross-border smuggling and insurgency.

When president Donald Trump stepped off Air Force One on to Scottish soil, he had one thing on his mind.

“There's no place like Turnberry,” he told his travelling press pool beneath the wing of his presidential jet. His Ayrshire golf course, he continued, was “the best … probably the best course in the world”.

Minutes later, he climbed into the Beast – his armoured limousine - to travel 35 minutes along country lanes and through Scottish villages, lined with supporters, protesters, and the merely curious, to Turnberry.

Mr Trump may be determined to have a break, but European leaders have other ideas. Willingly or otherwise, Mr Trump faces a string of meetings in the coming days as the Continent's power brokers sit down with the unpredictable president.

For now, though, he is secure inside a ring of steel. The historic course, home to some of the most exciting Opens in history, has been locked down. It now sits inside an eight-foot fence, its fairways dotted with burly men in dark suits and earpieces.

Snipers watch over the course from a watch tower.

Police officers – some on quad bikes – patrol the famous course and the dunes that flank it.

Mr Trump arrived with his golf clubs for four days at his two Scottish courses but without some of the trappings of a travelling American president.

He travelled with a stripped-down retinue of aides. There was no chief of staff, director of communications, secretary of state or other cabinet ministers, who might be expected on an important foreign trip.

His public weekend schedule showed no planned events. Instead, it was a chance to spend time at his golf course with his sons Eric, who manages the family businesses, and Don Jr.

Officials insisted that this was a “working trip” including a meeting with Sir Keir Starmer on Monday, although they were vague on agenda items.

Yet all that changed shortly before Mr Trump flew out of Washington, when Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, announced on X that she would be meeting Mr Trump on Sunday as she closes in on a trade deal:

Following a good call with @POTUS, we have agreed to meet in Scotland on Sunday to discuss transatlantic trade relations, and how we can keep them strong.

EU members have drawn up a retaliatory hit list. The plan is to impose 30pc tariffs on bourbon whisky, yachts, soybeans and other American products if a deal cannot be reached by August 1 to lift US levies.

Mrs von der Leyen had better tread carefully. A diplomat who has prepared ministers for meetings with Mr Trump said she was playing a high-risk game. “Very dangerous,” they said.

Mr Trump's chat with reporters at Glasgow Prestwick Airport showed a president relaxed and looking forward to four days of golf, but one who was quick to bristle when it came to policy and politics.

Mr Trump left Washington bugged by the drip, drip, drip of headlines about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire paedophile who took his own life in a jail cell six years ago.

He flashed irritation and lobbed sharp words at reporters who asked him how much he knew about the case on Friday, but relaxed as soon as he could talk about the love of his life: golf and the course at Turnberry.

“Sean Connery helped get me the permits,” he claimed after landing. “If it weren't for Sean Connery, we wouldn't have those great courses.”

There is a lesson for European leaders looking to muscle in on his tee times with their trade demands or for John Swinney, the Scottish First Minister, who is likely to tell Mr Trump that his tariffs are hurting the Scotch whisky industry.

When the chat with reporters turned from golf to more substantial matters, he said he had a simple message for Europe.

“On immigration, you better get your act together,” he said in another flash of passion. “You're not going to have Europe anymore... This immigration is killing Europe.”

Anyone meeting with Mr Trump will remember the lessons of Volodymyr Zelensky's Oval Office row. The Ukrainian president was roundly chastised by Mr Trump and his vice president for daring to push back on the US position.

And by hosting leaders at his Turnberry and Aberdeenshire courses, Mr Trump retains home advantage even while on foreign soil.

Sir Keir may have got the memo. Mr Trump billed their meeting as little more than a chance to celebrate their recent trade deal.

Although the Prime Minister does run the risk of upsetting Mr Trump over plans to raise the plight of civilians in Gaza, British officials played down the chances of any major diplomatic announcements.

“It's not like other meetings where we would go in with deliverables we planned to announce,” he said.

On Saturday, all that was far from Mr Trump's mind. He spent the day golfing with son Eric, and his ambassador to London.

The sound of Billy Joel's ‘Uptown Girl' and ‘Memories' from the musical Cats drifted out from the dunes on Saturday morning as Mr Trump's motorcade of golf buggies arrived at the fourth hole.

Photographers huddled on a mound in the dunes, hoping to get a shot of the president on the course.

Mr Trump, wearing a white USA cap and dressed in black, waved at the mound before teeing off in the direction of Turnberry lighthouse.

Cheers from his baseball-cap-wearing entourage could be heard above the din of the speakers as the group wasted little time in rattling off their drives.

A photographer camped in the dunes with a long lens later claimed to have witnessed the president cheat on the third fairway.

He said Mr Trump had been handed a ball by a caddy, which he then dropped to the floor and pushed forward a little with an iron before taking a swing.

The golf course has been surrounded by an eight-foot-high metal fence, while dozens of officers patrolled the entrances to the beach from Turnberry all the way down to Maidens, the next town along the coast.

A temporary watchtower had been erected to monitor the Turnberry perimeter with a sniper rifle trained on the course below.

A drone scanned from above, and police boats patrolled the coastal waters.

Asked whether there would be a repeat of protesters taking to the beach in front of the golf club, an officer said the incident in 2018 had likely convinced the authorities to close off the entire beach to the public.

Fears that the visit would be a magnet for protesters appeared unfounded.

Matt Halliday, from Stranraer, said he had been driving around for two hours trying and failing to find protests to join.

He said Mr Trump had “stamped all over Scotland” with his grand golf resort plans, strong-arming local farmers and “bullying” the council over wind farm plans.

One of his signs bore a picture of the president with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.

“I think it is going to bring him down,” he said.

However, supporters were easier to find than protesters.

Two wearing red “Make England Great Again” hats arrived shortly after the president had disappeared over the crest of a dune.

“We love Trump,” said Kay English, 37, wearing a face mask sporting the president's face.

Tom English, a 38-year-old driver, said the pair had driven up from Liverpool last night to catch a glimpse of the president.

“We support Maga, Trump and what he is doing,” he told reporters, adding: “I like the way he is, the way he speaks. It is comedy gold.

“He is putting the people first. He is trying to help the whole world to make peace - he is the president of peace.”

Mr English said he would return on Sunday and hopefully get within “shouting distance” to offer words of encouragement to the president and cheer on his cost-cutting Doge unit.

He added: “We love Doge, we are trying to get that here through Reform. There is so much being wasted.”

Mr Trump has long blurred the line between family, business and public life.

But any world leader intruding on his golfing getaway had better be ready for a possible sharp response.

Before the genocide, malnutrition was a rare diagnosis. Now more than 2 million Gazans are forced to survive on nothing.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

I first learned about malnutrition from textbooks and documentaries in my medical school. I followed the scenes of hunger emerging from Somalia and South Sudan. I wholeheartedly felt them — with every sip of potable water I drank while theirs was polluted, with each bite of food I ate while they were reduced to skin and bones. Yet I never imagined that one day, I would be in their place — subjected not just to killing, but also to starvation and malnutrition.

Malnutrition, as defined by the World Health Organization, is a deficiency, excess, or imbalance in a person's intake of energy and nutrients. It may be caused by reduced dietary intake, malabsorption of macro- and micronutrients, or increased energy expenditure related to disease. But in Gaza, the meaning of malnutrition has been forcibly redefined — it is systematically human-made and weaponized. It is no longer just a health condition, but a calculated strategy. Since March 2, Israeli forces have sealed off the borders and imposed what may be the tightest blockade in our history of struggle, deliberately restricting food access.

Before the genocide, malnutrition was a rare diagnosis. Today, more than 2 million Gazans are forced to survive on nothing. Flour is scarce. Canned food is consumed while fresh vegetables remain a distant dream, unavailable or unaffordable. Aid parcels — meant to save lives — may cost a Palestinian their life, as Gaza's humanitarian “relief” system has become a death trap disguised as mercy.

In Gaza, the meaning of malnutrition has been forcibly redefined — it is systematically human-made and weaponized. 

We have been forced not only to skip meals, but also to skip entire days of eating, exposing our bodies to lethal complications. Acute malnutrition is not just about hunger or weight loss. It attacks every organ system, bringing severe risks of illness and death — especially for the young and the elderly. My nephews, born and raised under genocide, have had no chance to build strength or immunity. Pale and emaciated, with fragile bodies, they fight disease with nothing but weakness.

Malnutrition impairs the immune system, leaving us defenseless against disease. I, myself, became vulnerable to the simplest infections — bedridden for days, even weeks, unable to function. Malnutrition doesn't just cause illness, it prolongs it. It adds layers to our suffering, and offers no escape from its vicious cycle.

Malnutrition also attacks the cardiovascular system — decreasing cardiac output, disrupting blood flow, and causing arrhythmia, low blood pressure, and even heart failure. I suffered tachycardia (a too-fast heart rate), nausea, and fainting spells caused by severe deficiency. For the elderly — especially those with preexisting heart conditions — this is a death sentence.

Deficiencies in essential vitamins and minerals impair memory, concentration, and cognition. I suffer these effects daily, trying to study while living under the shadow of death.

The gastrointestinal system suffers too, if not immediately, then over time. Malnutrition impairs the intestines' ability to absorb nutrients and regulate electrolytes. Living off canned food for nearly two years has inflamed my peptic ulcers and worsened my colitis.

As a medical student, I knew what might help even a little. I once kept a supply of supplementary vitamins, but now due to Israel's blockade, vitamins are impossible to access. 

Recently, a diabetic patient died during a hypoglycemic attack — his family couldn't find a single sweet to save him. Mothers across Gaza are unable to breastfeed their starving infants — because they themselves are starving. UN agencies have distributed therapeutic food, but it's nowhere near enough. Most mothers give it to their children and go hungry themselves.

Malnutrition doesn't stop at the body — it invades the mind. It disrupts serotonin production, causing severe depression, anxiety, and emotional instability. Deficiencies in essential vitamins and minerals impair memory, concentration, and cognition. I suffer these effects daily, trying to study while living under the shadow of death. My memory falters, my thoughts scatter. Children deprived of nutrition face lifelong consequences to their growth, both mental and physical.

Malnutrition also delays healing and worsens clinical outcomes. I spoke to Rawan Y., a fellow medical student and survivor of a genocidal injury. She told me: “I got injured on March 2 and was discharged on March 17. Back then, we were on the edge of famine. Then famine invaded. I underwent three surgeries. I was supposed to get the nutritious food I needed for recovery — but the reality was the stark opposite.”

She paused, her voice cracking.

“I live with the torment of knowing what's happening inside my body. I know the damage. I had spleen and kidney injuries, first-degree burns, and three broken ribs. It's been four months — and my wounds remain unhealed, painful, and persistent.”

Dr. Mohammed Altalla, who works as a doctor in a surgical department in Gaza and also serves as a teaching assistant in the faculty of medicine at Gaza's Al Azhar University, confirmed the devastating toll of malnutrition on recovery:

“One of the major consequences of malnutrition is delayed healing. Proteins, vitamins, and zinc are simply unavailable. Surgical site infections have surged – we deal with them daily,” he told me. 

“People collapse in the streets, rushed to hospitals. The life-saving intervention in many cases is as simple as glucose. But even that is running out.” 

I also spoke with Shaimaa Bashir, a clinical nutritionist working with a humanitarian organization on the ground in Gaza. She told me that acute malnutrition has risen by 146 percent in just three months. “Hundreds of thousands of patients are hospitalized daily with complications from malnutrition — irregular heartbeats, dangerously low blood pressure,” she said. “Many were already vulnerable even before their injuries — now it's far worse.”

Moreover, Bashir notes: “Since mid-May 2025, Gaza has been in an unprecedented severe food emergency. Ninety-three percent of the population faces food insecurity. Twenty-two percent are now in phase five — the catastrophic phase — of hunger. If no aid arrives, we expect the entire population will fall into phase four — acute severe malnutrition — by September 2025.”

Meanwhile, 17,000 women who are pregnant or breastfeeding desperately need medical nutrition, but none is available due to severe drug shortages and constant displacement. A malnourished mother may pass her malnutrition to her infant — or face miscarriage.

Bashir added that feeding options for patients are almost nonexistent. “We have no access to therapeutic food, IV nutrition, or nasogastric tubes,” she said. “The only remaining source is supplementary sweets for children — and even that is in short supply.”

“People collapse in the streets, rushed to hospitals. The life-saving intervention in many cases is as simple as glucose. But even that is running out,” Altalla said. 

Then he paused, his voice quieter: “It's not just the patients. We — the medical staff — are barely functioning. We struggle to stay focused ourselves.”

“The food situation is so dire that every day the question arises whether the patients in the hospitals we support and the medical staff who care for them will be able to eat anything at all,” echoed Caroline Willemen, a project coordinator in Gaza City for Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders), in a statement. “We are desperate. As an occupying power the Israeli authorities have an obligation to provide aid to people in Gaza. Right now, they are deliberately starving them.”

The health of more than 2 million people hangs in the balance, clinging to the hope of aid trucks that never come.

Each delay is a death sentence.

Each denied truck is a stolen chance at survival.

Malnutrition is preventable. It is reversible.

But not under Israel's siege.

The only way to stop this engineered starvation is to open the borders — to let food in, to let Palestinians live.

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:truthout.org","Amid Rising Fascism, the Left Looks for Action. It Should Also Ask Questions.","https://truthout.org/articles/amid-rising-fascism-the-left-looks-for-action-it-should-also-ask-questions/","Sat, 26 Jul 2025 13:20:20 GMT","

There's no cookie-cutter solution to confronting fascism; action must be grounded in analysis, says Robin D. G. Kelley.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

The anti-colonial struggle for a free Palestine has reached a desperate point as the Israeli military regularly fires on starving Palestinians seeking aid and water. Meanwhile, the rise of fascism in the United States continues at an alarming pace, with unprecedented funding passed for Immigration and Customs Enforcement expansion as the public continues to witness masked kidnappings and disappearances.

Seventy-five years after the publication of Aimé Césaire's Discourse on Colonialism, Robin D.G. Kelley argues that the book still has important lessons to teach in the current historical moment. Fascist states are not a perversion of liberal democracies but rather their extension, and it is critically important that anti-fascism incorporates anti-colonial approaches.

In this exclusive interview for Truthout, Kelley offers a vision of the work needed on the left that goes beyond looking for answers or examples to follow. Kelley is a professor of U.S. history at the University of California, Los Angeles, and an author or editor of more than a dozen books, including Freedom Dreams and Hammer and Hoe. The interview that follows has been lightly edited for clarity and length.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

October Krausch: You started your remarks at the Socialism Conference by saying you're a better historian than activist. Why was it important to you to name that right at the top?

Robin D. G. Kelley: It's part of a larger point I was making about what it means to be at this conference where people are literally looking for answers. I think we have done an absolutely horrible job of understanding and analyzing both the conditions now and before. A lot of people want inspiration from me. They want me to get people inspired about the possible future and what we're going to do. Because I write about social movements, they want me to pull out examples, and that's not useful to me. I specifically gave a lecture that was about understanding the things that are not so clear to us: the close relationship between liberalism and fascism historically and in the present, and the fundamentally intertwined relationship between colonialism and fascism. That's what I do well. If someone says, “Well I need you to go out and get 40,000 signatures,” I can't do that.

Some people have decided that scholarship and analysis are less important than action. I'm not saying it's more important or less; I'm saying you can't separate it. By holding up action separate from critical analysis, we end up fetishizing this invention called the activist. And then they say, “Yeah, we love Robin because he's an activist.”

So that was my way of saying I don't want to be in a position where people say, “So what do we do?” Because that's for all of us as a collective to figure out. And I wanted people to listen and follow this analysis, which I think is useful, but not so much for literal lessons. I don't think history works that way. The lessons to me are the lessons that Césaire laid out [in Discourse on Colonialism] in terms of the relationship.

What you're saying reminds me of something I've learned from abolition: One of the problems with the criminal legal system is its cookie-cutter approach. We have essentially the exact same prison in Michigan and in Texas and in California, then the U.S. exports those prisons to Brazil and that's the “solution” for all kinds of harm. I've learned a lot by taking seriously that history doesn't work that way, the social world doesn't work that way, conflicts don't work that way. But you see that desire for a template to follow repeated all over. Very few things work that way and it creates a lot of harm.

Exactly. It's also that the powers that be want you to use a cookie-cutter approach. I feel like part of my whole project as a Marxist historian is to try to locate and understand what we can't see. That's what Karl Marx did. In Capital, Volume 1, Marx talks about the secret of the labor theory of value. All that value, you can't see it; it's hidden because it's in labor power.

There can never be a cookie-cutter approach because we've got to figure out what we don't see. I fear sometimes it's very easy to fall into the trap of empiricism. People would think, Well, of course because if something is empirical it means that we can actually locate it and see it. The problem is it's hiding other things that we can't see.

I've never been one to only write about the glories and the existence of working people because we have to understand what is it that reproduces work. Why is it that they're fighting in the first place? Why is it that they're losing? That means studying power. That means like reading all 925 pages or whatever it is of Project 2025. To me, that's just as important as reading personal narratives of working people winning.

At the keynote, you talked a lot about the continuity of fascism and liberal democracy, especially the continuity of fascism and colonialism. You offered that the establishment of Israel precisely in the era of formal international decolonization is a really powerful example of why we have fascism here in the United States today: Colonialism never ended and we will always have the problem of fascism if we're not thinking about those as intertwined things. Some of your examples were about anti-fascist struggles that were not anti-colonial or were anti-Black. Your lecture had me thinking about Sophie Lewis's recent book, Enemy Feminisms. One of the things Lewis says is that, as feminists, we have a tendency to define, say, anti-abortion feminists or KKK feminists, as outside of “real” feminism. Lewis says that we have to own that and then we have to think about where the seeds of domination and white supremacy lie inside of feminism. Do you think it makes sense to think in a similar way about enemy lefts or enemy socialisms?

The left has already done that. We call it sectarianism! Unfortunately, it's not always been done in the most thoughtful way. I think what Sophie Lewis is trying to do in the book is very thoughtful in terms of having a critical analysis of the positions that are within a framework of feminism. It's not to abandon feminism, but to really understand it. With the enemy socialism example, these folks are basically constructing enemies as a way of either trying to maintain or attain some kind of hegemony within left circles, or because they have a disagreement in analysis that's not a fundamental disagreement in values.

Part of my concern is actually the opposite. I understand enemy feminists, but once we start to do what the left has done for a long time — that is, attack those we disagree with as social fascists or as left opportunists — there's no opportunity to build through critique, dialogue, and struggle, which offers a way of understanding that maybe our critique is wrong.

For me, that's also about grace. There are some people in left organizations who I completely disagree with, including (and I struggle with this) the leftists who have a really bad position on race. I could make a decision to sort of expose and dispose of them, or to say, “Okay, let's critique that failure to understand race.”

I'm so frustrated with the Marxist-Leninists who are basically applauding Donald Trump because the Trump administration is getting rid of DEI [diversity, equity, and inclusion], like, “Well, that's great, because DEI is just a neoliberal trick.” For me, that's just dumb. So rather than say, “Oh, they're the enemy,” I write and argue and publicly speak against that position and explain why. I expect and want a response. Because to debate it and recognize that we share a lot in common is to pull people within that movement into ours.

I'm wrestling with some of these ideas and I think a lot of people are. When is someone your enemy? And when is it like, “Okay, we can travel together for a certain amount of time”? That's a difficult decision to make and there's no template for it. At the same time, we have to really draw some hard lines because people are going to sell us out when we're in these higher stakes.

I agree with that. I think there are times when we do have to draw hard lines. I guess what I'm also saying is that there's a value in making that critique as clear and public as possible. It doesn't have to be friendly.

There are basically a lot of racist white left organizations. They're everywhere. I dream about them at night. There are left tendencies that are deeply nationalist, which I think is problematic as well.

If we're trying to build a working-class power, then it doesn't make sense to ignore or vilify every single segment of the working class. It's enough to continue taking them to task and explaining why. In Hammer and Hoe, I wrote about Klansmen who end up joining the Communist Party because they saw it as maybe the best option, but they don't come politically correct. They would use like, comrade n*****. Communist Party members were like, “You can't say that,” but they wouldn't say, “You have to leave.” The Party would work with them as much as they could to bring them in, but at the same time, promote organic leadership. That's two really important things that may seem counterbalancing: to promote organic leadership and to promote and support people who may not actually know it all.

It's also important to listen and engage because if we really do believe we have the right position on everything, then we're living in a dreamworld. I've never known of a movement in my life that has the right position on everything. Even today, we're so advanced that we don't have the right position on everything. You don't know yet.

It's funny, it feels like a contradiction in and of itself to say, “Oh, I didn't know either and now I know this thing,” but you feel at any given moment in time like, “I have a bunch of strongly held beliefs. They're the correct beliefs.”

Right, there's nothing wrong with really believing that you have the correct belief. In fact, if you don't, why do you do it? The contradictions are high.

Part of what I was trying to say [in the keynote speech] was that too many of us, at least in my circle, stop at the recognition that fascism itself is a product of colonial rule. And then they end up falling into the shaft of creating the hierarchy of the colonized and the white people. Part of my discussion about austerity was to add another dimension to class struggle, saying that in order for colonialism to actually work, they had to crush the European working class. They had to make the working class not just nationalist, but weak enough to eliminate as much anti-imperialist sentiment as possible.

That means we have to go even deeper in our analysis of understanding the European working class. It's just not enough to analyze the world as if all the colonized are the oppressed and the white people are the oppressor. Because then we have no understanding of the BRICS countries, for example. That's what I'm saying: A lot of us, even those who think we have all the answers, don't have that analysis yet.

I was reminded in a recent panel at the Socialism Conference that the Vietnamese national liberation movement did win against more powerful militaries. That's easy to forget at a time when people here don't seem to feel that there is potential for big wins. But it happens and it's happened in history. Simultaneously, you highlight the way those victories are incomplete. And that's part of why we're still fighting fascism, right? How do you negotiate living in that tension?

Yes. Vietnam as a national liberation movement defeated the United States. Vietnam as a national liberation defeated France in 1954. Vietnam, just like Haiti. But I would argue that communism in Vietnam was defeated, even though the nation of Vietnam won in the short term.

What is Vietnam now? Vietnam, along with Bangladesh, produces much of the world's textiles from the lowest-paid workers. It's the continuation of the exploitation of labor in a place that fought to end the exploitation of labor. Most of those companies that do business making apparel in Vietnam are U.S. companies or multinational companies. Vietnam just made this trade deal with Trump. There is a rising Vietnamese elite, much like China. The Chinese Communist Party has become — and again, I have lots of debates with people about this — has become the organization, if you're a bureaucrat, where you can become a millionaire. That's not the vision that brought peasants and workers to the party. The victory is nevertheless a sign of the inability of U.S. imperialism to win everything it wants. But it's also the long-term defeat of communist vision and practice, and it's a sign that the capital order is intact and it ebbs and flows.

Capitalism is not going anywhere anytime soon unless we do something different. If we were to really take the question of why did Vietnam defeat the United States, we have to ask two other questions: What was the state of the United States at the time of its withdrawal? It was a global economic crisis and the U.S. economy was in shambles in many ways. The price of the war was just too much. What made the price of war go up? Working people in the United States. All those struggles in the '60s and early '70s to expand the welfare state made government spending higher. The War on Poverty was a minuscule amount of money but, nevertheless, it was competing with the war expenditure.

The result of the global realignment that has happened since that time is that the combined power of China, Russia, India, Brazil, South Africa and Saudi Arabia outweighs the United States. What did these BRICS countries produce? Did they produce the beautiful, amazing welfare state of the non-aligned movements? No, they created massive inequality and state repression, all the things that are required to maintain colonial and fascist power. So we're still here. I'm not trying to be pessimistic, but this is the nature of class struggle. The grounds keep shifting on us. And if you don't see the grounds as global, then we end up not knowing who or how to fight or how things happen behind our backs.

This is why we don't need slogans. We need answers. And we can't have answers without really good questions. We can't have good questions without knowing the history. And it comes down to that. I think about what it means that someone like Vladimir Lenin, who was kind of busy, would write an entire book-length study on agriculture in the U.S.

Marxists have always been immersed in history, but we're not so much anymore. It's not about the left, it's about our culture altogether. And again, it also goes back to the activist ethos, and this notion that to be activists, we need action now. That's kind of a fetish. When political education ends up becoming, “What are the immediate strategic issues that we need to deal with now?” rather than developing a larger analysis, that's a little bit of anti-intellectualism.

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

“Exploiting the seabed is not a necessity — it is a choice,” said Palau's president. “And it is reckless.”

Despite growing momentum, world governments failed to agree to a moratorium on deep-sea mining as the 30th session of the International Seabed Authority wrapped up on Friday.

The authority's July meeting was the first since U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to expedite permits for deep-sea mining under U.S. authority and The Metals Company (TMC) promptly applied for U.S. permits. Governments rebuked the U.S. and TMC for their unilateral approach and did not agree on a mining code that would allow the controversial practice to move forward under international law. However, campaigners said more decisive action is needed to protect the ocean and its biodiversity.

“Governments have yet to rise to the moment,” Greenpeace International campaigner Louisa Casson said in a statement. “They remain disconnected from global concerns and the pressing need for courageous leadership to protect the deep ocean.”

Casson continued: “We call on the international community to rise up and defend multilateralism against rogue actors like The Metals Company. Governments must respond by establishing a moratorium and reaffirming that authority over the international seabed lies collectively with all states — for the benefit of humanity as a whole.”

The International Seabed Authority (ISA) gains its authority to regulate deep-sea mining under the United Nations Law of the Sea, to which the U.S. is not party. TMC, however, could suffer consequences for bypassing the international process, as other countries and companies may decide not to do business with it.

At the most recent session, the ISA's council decided not to revoke exploratory permits it had previously granted to TMC and its subsidiaries. However, it approved an investigation on Monday into whether mining contractors such as TMC subsidiaries Nauru Ocean Resources Inc. and Tonga Offshore Mining Limited were abiding by their obligations under international law.

“TMC has been testing the limits of what it can get away with, a bit like a child seeing how far it can go with bad behavior,” Matthew Gianni, cofounder of the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition (DSCC), told The New York Times.

“The member countries of the ISA have basically sent a shot across the bow, a warning to TMC that going rogue may well result in the loss of its ISA exploration claims,” Gianna explained, adding that the investigation also served as a warning to other companies who might consider following TMC's example.

Casson agreed: “The international community's message to The Metals Company is clear: Violating international law, ignoring scientific consensus, and disregarding human rights will have consequences. This is also a warning to any companies or governments choosing to align themselves with [TMC CEO] Gerard Barron's business model — they must be prepared to bear the reputational fallout of trying to destroy the ocean.”

At the same time, a U.S. representative spoke on Thursday, doubling down on Trump's dismissal of the international process and earning instant push back from Brazil, France, and China

“As a non-party to the Law of the Sea Convention, the United States is not bound by the convention rules dealing with seabed mining through the International Seabed Authority,” the U.S. statement said in part.

The statement came days after Greenpeace released a report titled Deep Deception: How the Deep-Sea Mining Industry is Manipulating Geopolitics to Profit from Ocean Destruction, which details how TMC and other deep-sea mining companies are exploiting national security concerns to lobby U.S. lawmakers to fast track deep-sea mining.

“The U.S. statement confirms what Deep Deception has already exposed: The Trump administration's pursuit of deep-sea mining isn't about global stewardship — it's about sidestepping it,” Arlo Hemphill, Greenpeace USA's project lead for the Stop Deep-Sea Mining campaign, said in a statement. “By rejecting the ISA's authority while claiming environmental responsibility, the U.S. is trying to have it both ways — and in doing so is advancing a ‘smash and grab' agenda that puts ocean health and international cooperation at serious risk.”

Ultimately, ocean advocates agree that the only way to protect the deep sea is for governments to agree to a precautionary pause on a practice they argue would do irreparable harm to ecosystems science barely understands.

The consensus for such a pause is building, with Croatia becoming the 38th nation to support one during the latest ISA meeting.

“The ISA is paralyzed by a small group clinging to outdated extraction agendas while blocking even the most basic reforms,” Simon Holmström, the deep-sea mining policy officer for Seas at Risk, said in a statement. “The firm rejection of the U.S. and The Metals Company's power grab, alongside 38 countries now calling for a moratorium or precautionary pause, shows growing resistance to sacrificing the planet's least understood ecosystem for corporate short-term profit.”

Several nations spoke strongly in favor a moratorium, including Palau, Panama, and France.

“Exploiting the seabed is not a necessity — it is a choice,” said His Excellency Surangel S. Whipps Jr., president of the Republic of Palau, on Tuesday. “And it is reckless. It is gambling with the future of Pacific Island children, who will inherit the dire consequences of decisions made far from their shores.”

A Pacific leader from Solomon Island also defended the interests of the Pacific Ocean community: “As Pacific people, we continue to carry the trauma of what extractive industries have already done to our homes. Mining companies that came with promises, stripped our lands and waters, and left behind ecological, cultural, and spiritual scars. We cannot let that cycle repeat itself, in the ocean that connects us. That sustains us. And that defines us.”

Olivier Poivre d'Arvor of France called for a pause of 10-15 years: “Our message is clear: no deep-sea mining without science, without collective legitimacy, without equity […] France is calling for a moratorium or a precautionary pause. What for? Because we refuse to mortgage the future for a few nodules extracted in a hurry, in favor of a few.”

However, campaigners argued that many governments continued to fall short of the commitments they had made at the U.N. Ocean Conference (UNOC) in Nice in early June.

“Thirty-eight states have now joined the call for a moratorium or precautionary pause, with Croatia joining the coalition during this Assembly,” said DSCC campaign director Sofia Tsenikli. “But too many other states, which were bold in their ocean promises at UNOC, are not putting this into action at the ISA. Governments must meet their promises by doing what it takes to implement a moratorium before it's too late.”

Farah Obaidullah, founder and director of The Ocean and Us, argued that the ocean already faces too many other threats to add the additional burden of deep-sea mining.

“The health of the high seas including the seabed is critical to our own. Yet our shared heritage faces an onslaught of threats from climate and nature collapse, escalating tensions, and failed leadership,” Obaidullah said. “To even consider a new form of ecocide on our already ailing planet is both reckless and irrational. We know that deep-sea mining will devastate life in the deep ocean, wipe out species before they have been discovered, and impact ocean functions, including carbon sequestration. When it comes to the ocean we have no time to lose. We cannot colonize and conquer our shared heritage which belongs to us all. There is only one responsible way forward, and that is to secure a moratorium on deep-sea mining.”

DSCC's Gianni also argued strongly for a pause: “Being on the fence or remaining silent is not a politically defensible position. We are risking severe ecological damage, and future generations will ask what we did to stop it. There is still a chance to stop this industry before it begins, but only if governments stand up for science, equity, and precaution now, and take action to prevent companies within their jurisdiction from cooperating with rogue mining operations.”

Greenpeace's Hemphill concluded: “Governments must secure a moratorium that leaves no room for a desperate industry to force through a mining code. The science is not ready. The legal framework is not in place. The world must not be bullied into an irreversible mistake for the benefit of a few.”

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

            Retired CIA official Susan Miller, an author of the agency's 2017 intelligence report on Russian election meddling, is vowing to fight any potential criminal charges brought by the Trump administration.
    


            Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has accused the Obama administration of manufacturing the intelligence report, which assessed that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to help Donald Trump, and said she made criminal referrals to the Justice Department.
    


            “My team and I, just yesterday, had a few drinks and talked about that, and talked about what lawyers we'd be looking for, if that happens,” Miller told CNN's Kaitlan Collins on “The Source” on Friday.
    


            “But I'll do it. I'll fight, I'll fight to the end,” she added.
    


            Pushing back against Gabbard's accusations, Miller said that no one – including then-President Barack Obama or then-CIA Director John Brennan – had told her team what conclusion to reach in their report. “Absolutely not,” she said. She added that she and her team would have quit if they had faced such pressure.
    


            Miller said the intelligence that helped them reach their conclusion “was extremely sound and it was verified.” Miller also said her team briefed Trump at the time.
    


            She went on to say that the report's findings were “not at all” based on the so-called Steele dossier, which was included as an addendum.
    


            The infamous dossier was written by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, and funded by Hillary Clinton's campaign. It alleged coordination between the Russian government and people associated with the Trump campaign, though its ultimate credibility was limited.
    


            While Miller's team “could determine that 100%” Russia tried to influence the 2016 election, it's indeterminable whether Moscow's efforts worked, Miller said.
    


            “But the bottom line is, yes, they tried to influence it. No, unless we poll every voter as to why they voted, we can't tell you if that worked. And therefore, from our perspective, Trump is our president. And we just left it at that,” she told CNN.
    


            In a statement, the White House praised Gabbard and described the 2017 intelligence report and its findings as a “total hoax and political witch hunt to snub President Trump's historic first term in office.”
    


            “I think it is wrong in every single way,” Miller told CNN in response and warned of Gabbard's attacks against the report and its findings.
    


            “What Tulsi is saying is: ‘We only want to hear anything that's pro-Trump, pro-Trump policy … pro-current Republican Party from any of our intel services, and if we hear anything that's not that, then we're going to come after you.' And that's what it feels like. And so, what analyst wants to put his or her, their name on any paper now?” she said.
    


            Miller said she and her team told the truth and the information was well sourced.
    


            “We looked at everything, and we're being now told that we somehow did it wrong, we didn't have analysts involved, when three of my team were analysts. We had rigorous analytic reviews by our then-head of analysis. And it just, it doesn't make sense to me. It just doesn't. It really is sad.”

            Fleeing Washington's oppressive humidity and nonstop questions over heated controversies, President Donald Trump is once again taking weekend refuge at his golf clubs — this time more than 3,000 miles away in Scotland.
    


            While the White House has called his five-day trip a “working visit,” it's fairly light on the formal itinerary. Trump is poised to hold trade talks Sunday with the chief of the European Union and is scheduled to meet with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Monday.
    


            But he's expected to spend most of his trip out of public view at two of his golf resorts – Trump Turnberry in the west and Trump International about 200 miles away in the north, near his mother's ancestral homeland.
    


            “We have a lot of things in Scotland,” Trump said as he left the White House on Friday, noting his familial ties to the land. “I have a lot of love.”
    


            Even as protesters demonstrated against Trump here on Saturday, the four nights in temperate Scotland come as a summertime respite after six months back in office. His administration is engulfed in a deepening political crisis over its handling of disclosures around the case of Jeffrey Epstein, accused sex trafficker and former friend of the president's.
    


            Nearly every time Trump has spoken with reporters in recent weeks, he's been pressed with new questions about the Epstein scandal, many of which are fueled by deep suspicions that he and his followers have been stirring for years. New revelations about his personal ties to the disgraced financier have kept the matter alive.
    


            The Scotland trip schedule allows Trump to focus instead on areas where he's more comfortable: trade deals, his family businesses and golf. Trump often speaks fondly of his ties to Scotland, the birthplace of his late mother, though the feeling has been far from mutual — his development of luxury golf resorts over the last two decades has ignited objections from many local residents.
    


            “What he did in the many estates in Aberdeenshire, and how he bullied and intimidated the local people there, he's not a nice person,” said Fiona McPherson, who joined a demonstration Saturday. “America was our ally for so long. We relied on America so much. Now, it's an embarrassment.”
    


            The centerpiece of this trip is a dedication and ribbon-cutting ceremony on Tuesday for a new 18-hole golf course in Aberdeenshire on the windswept coast of the North Sea. It's named the MacLeod Course in honor of Trump's mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, who was born in 1912 outside of Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis.
    


            She left for New York in 1930 at the age of 18, emigrating to the United States following World War I. She married Fred C. Trump, the son of German immigrants, in 1936 and died in 2000. A black and white photograph of her sits prominently behind the president's desk in the Oval Office.
    


            Authorities in Scotland have spent weeks preparing for Trump's arrival. Assistant Chief Constable Emma Bond told reporters the security operation would be the largest the country has mounted since the death of Queen Elizabeth II in 2022, including local officers, national security divisions and special constables.
    


            The overall tone toward Trump has been markedly less fond, however. The Friday edition of The National, a liberal-leaning newspaper that supports Scottish independence, rolled out a not-so-welcoming message to Trump with a blaring and bold front-page headline: “Convicted US Felon to Arrive in Scotland.”
    


            A group called Stop Trump Scotland, a coalition of demonstrators, organized protests at Aberdeen and outside the US consulate in Edinburgh as part of a “Festival of Resistance.” A few hundred people turned out Saturday to raise their voices against the visiting American president, waving colorful signs and chanting slogans.
    


            As he arrived in Scotland on Friday night, Trump made no mention of the disapproval awaiting him. He said he eagerly anticipated meeting left-leaning Scottish First Minister John Swinney, who has been an outspoken critic and last year endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris.
    


            “He's a good man,” Trump told reporters. “I look forward to meeting him.”
    


            With trade talks intensifying, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen announced Friday that she planned to meet with Trump in Scotland on Sunday “to discuss transatlantic trade relations and how we can keep them strong.”
    


            Trump said earlier there was a “50-50” chance he would reach a trade deal with the EU, adding as he departed for Scotland that his administration was “working very diligently” with Europe.
    


            Trump's meeting with von der Leyen — whom he has not yet hosted at the White House — comes as the EU rushes to clinch a trade deal with its largest trading partner that would stave off a threatened 30% tariff set to take effect August 1.
    


            In the past, Trump has adopted a hostile attitude toward the European Union, claiming it was formed to “screw” the United States. He has maintained a somewhat distant relationship with von der Leyen, who was close to former President Joe Biden, adding another complexity to their Sunday meeting.
    


            “That would be, actually, the biggest deal of them all if we make it,” Trump said of a potential agreement with the European Union after he landed in Scotland Friday.
    


            It's the first visit Trump has made to the country since 2023, when he broke ground on the golf course dedicated to his mother. But returning this weekend as the sitting American president has roused critics, including Green Party leader and member of parliament, Patrick Harvie.
    


            “Donald Trump is a convicted criminal and political extremist,” Harvie told reporters in Scotland this week. “There can be no excuses for trying to cozy up to his increasingly fascist political agenda.”
    


            While golf is the primary item on Trump's weekend schedule, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt described the trip as “a working visit that will include a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Starmer to refine the historic US-UK trade deal.”
    


            Starmer has worked to develop a warm relationship with Trump, visiting him at the White House in February and holding conversations since then on trade, military support for Ukraine and other global challenges. It's paid off, at least somewhat — Starmer is one of a handful of country leaders who have secured a trade deal with Trump.
    


            The deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, officials said, is expected to be among the topics discussed, but British officials have generally been working to lower expectations for the Monday meeting, suggesting it is a prelude to an official state visit in September. Trump is set to return to the United Kingdom at the invitation of King Charles III for a ceremonial welcome at Windsor Castle. He was hosted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2019 at Buckingham Palace.
    


            “This is really special,” Starmer said in February when he extended the invitation to Trump in a letter from the King. “This has never happened before, this is unprecedented.”
    


            The Scotland visit is the fifth international trip Trump has taken since returning to office. He briefly visited Rome for Pope Francis' funeral in April, toured the Middle East in May, met with G7 leaders in Canada and attended a NATO summit in the Hague in June.
    


            “President Trump's affinity for Scotland is real, regardless of what people think of his politics,” Anas Sarwar, the Labour Party leader in Scotland wrote in an April essay in The Times of London. “His family's investments in Ayrshire and Aberdeenshire are real and significant.”
    


            This is the first trip overseas that is built nearly entirely around a weekend of golf. He hit the course Saturday morning, playing with the US Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Warren Stephens, along with the ambassador's son, the White House said. The president's sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., are accompanying him for the weekend.
    


            For a president who repeatedly railed against his predecessors for golfing – and called last week on the Republican Senate to cancel its annual August recess and “long weekends” to keep working on his agenda – Trump hits the links without apology, no matter the season.
    


            From his regular winter visits to two of his courses in Florida to his spring and summer trips to his clubs in Virginia and New Jersey, seldom does a weekend go by that Trump doesn't spend time at one of his golf courses or resorts.
    


            On this trip, Trump is scheduled to spend three nights at Trump Turnberry, a luxury resort that he has owned since 2014 on the west coast, overlooking the Irish Sea.
    


            “It's the best resort in the world, I think,” Trump boasted of his club.
    


            He will also spend one night at his course in Aberdeenshire, on the northern coast, and take part in the only public event expected on his itinerary: a dedication ceremony for a second 18-hole course.
    


            The president voiced optimism that one day the British Open would return to Turnberry. It was last held at Trump's course on the Scottish west coast in 2009, five years before Trump purchased the resort.
    


            “I think they will do that,” Trump said Friday. “Turnberry is rated the No. 1 course in the world.”
    


            The organizers of the Open have said concerns over lack of hotel space and some local road infrastructure challenges have prevented the championship from being played there. Politics is also at play, which was underscored by a full-page advertisement in the National newspaper on Friday that urged the public to sign a petition against it.
    


            “Don't let the divisiveness of Donald Trump hijack and overshadow this great event,” the advertisement said. “Do the right thing. Don't give The Open to Trump Turnberry.”

            When British traders landed on India's shores in the 1600s, they arrived in search of spices and silk but stayed for centuries – leaving behind a legacy that would shape the nation long after their colonial exploitation ended: the English language.
    


            Over the centuries, English seeped into the very fabric of Indian life – first as a tool of commerce, then as the language of law and, eventually, a marker of privilege.
    


            Now, after more than a decade of Hindu-nationalist rule, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is mounting perhaps the most significant challenge yet to the language's place in India.
    


            “Those who speak English will soon feel ashamed,” Home Minister Amit Shah said last month, igniting a heated debate about national identity and social mobility in the polyglot nation of 1.4 billion.
    


            While Shah did not mention India's former colonial masters, he declared that “the languages of our country are the jewels of our culture” – and that without them, “we cease to be truly Indian.”
    


            Spoken behind the walls of colonial forts and offices, English in India was at first the language of ledgers and treaties.
    


            But as British rule expanded from the ports of Gujarat to the palaces of Delhi, it became the lingua franca of the colonial elite.
    


            At independence, India faced a dilemma. With hundreds of languages and dialects spoken across its vast landscape, its newly appointed leaders grappled with the question of which one should represent the new nation.
    


            Hindi, the predominant language in the north, was put forward as a candidate for official language.
    


            But strong resistance from non-Hindi-speaking regions – especially in the south – meant English would remain only as a temporary link to unite the country. It's a legacy that endures to this day – and still rankles some.
    


            “I subscribe to the view that English is the language of the colonial masters,” Pradeep Bahirwani, a retired corporate executive from the southern city of Bengaluru, said, adding: “Our national language should be a language which… has got roots in India.”
    


            But critics argue that Shah's remarks risk undermining the country's global competitiveness. Equating English with cultural shame, they contend, reflects a narrow perspective that needlessly tries to erase a remnant of the colonial era that keeps India fluent in the language of global commerce.
    


            “It's the aspiration of people to have access to a language which has a lot of prestige internationally,” said Indian linguist Ayesha Kidwai, a professor at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University. “I don't think it's the legacy of colonialism anymore.”
    


            And pushback to the BJP's recent messaging has been strong.
    


            “English is not a barrier, it's a bridge. English is not shame, it's strength,” wrote leader of the opposition Rahul Gandhi on X, after Shah's remarks last month. “Every Indian language has a soul, culture, and knowledge. We must cherish them – and at the same time, teach every child English.”
    


            CNN has contacted India's Home Ministry for comment.
    


            But language tensions are no longer confined to debates in parliament – they're spilling into the streets.
    


            Just last week, video of a heated confrontation on a train in India's financial hub Mumbai went viral after a passenger was allegedly harassed for not speaking the regional language Marathi. Clashes erupted elsewhere in the city over the federal government's drive to promote Hindi – a language closely tied to the BJP's northern power base and often seen as central to the party's vision of national unity and Hindu identity.
    


            Since India's independence from Britain in 1947, the status of English in India has been deeply political – entwined with questions of identity, power, and national direction.
    


            Today, English is one of several official languages in India, spoken by about 10% of the population. Hindi is the first language for around 44% of citizens, according to the 2011 census.
    


            But in recent years, Modi's BJP has placed particular emphasis on promoting Hindi and reducing the use of English in public life.
    


            The prime minister almost never delivers speeches in English, preferring Hindi for national addresses such as his monthly radio program. His administration has encouraged officials to use Hindi on social media and in government correspondence – though, after criticism from non-Hindi-speaking states, clarified that this was intended mainly for the Hindi belt in the north.
    


            When India hosted world leaders for the 2023 G20 summit in New Delhi, invitations were sent out from “Bharat” – the Sanskrit or Hindi name for the country – instead of “India,” fueling speculation that the government aims to ultimately phase out the country's English designation altogether.
    


            Modi's critics have been quick to note his political motives behind these moves.
    


            With its roots in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing organization that advocates Hindu hegemony within India, the BJP's language policies resonate with many in a country where nearly 80% of people are Hindu.
    


            Analysts say the BJP is seeking to capitalize on this demographic by promoting language policies that strengthen its support base in the north.
    


            According to Rita Kothari, an English professor from Ashoka University, the government “is certainly interested in homogenizing the country and making Hindi more widespread.”
    


            But that policy can also backfire – in part because many regions, such as Marathi-speaking Maharashtra in the west – are staunchly proud of their local language.
    


            The violent clashes in the state's megacity Mumbai earlier this month were sparked by the regional government's controversial decision to make Hindi a compulsory third language in public primary schools.
    


            Pushback and protest has also been especially strong in the south, where English and regional languages such as Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada are valued as symbols of local identity and autonomy.
    


            For 19-year-old Steve E. Selvaraj from Tamil Nadu's capital Chennai, “the BJP did a great job turning Hindi as their identity.” The college student, whose mother tongue is Tamil, said Hinduism has become a central focus for the ruling establishment – a way to “get more votes.”
    


            “Day by day, the influence of Hindi is increasing,” Selvaraj said. “Hindi imposition may be a threat, but it will take a lot of time to disconnect the (local) connection with Tamil.”
    


            Kothari, from Ashoka University, said going after English was a convenient way of the BJP promoting Hindi without ruffling regional feathers.
    


            The government “knows that its chances of success in south India for instance are thwarted by linguistic pride and nationalism,” she said.
    


            “Since they can't make this public, English becomes a whipping boy.”
    


            India's widespread adoption of English can be traced back to the 19th-century British politician Thomas Macaulay, who advocated for the introduction of the language as the medium of instruction, instead of traditional languages of the elite like Sanskrit, Persian or Arabic.
    


            Macaulay's vision was unapologetically elitist. Creating a class of subjects who were “Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals, and in intellect,” to serve as intermediaries between the colonial administration and the local population, he wrote, would help the British rule more effectively.
    


            These views were adopted by the British government, making English the language of Indian administration, higher education and the judiciary. The policy fostered a privileged English-educated elite – lawyers, teachers and writers – including many of India's early reformer nationalists, first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi.
    


            But over time, English became far more than a holdover from colonial rule – turning into a symbol of modernity and opportunity. As India's economy transformed and its middle class expanded, English proficiency became crucial to upward mobility.
    


            For Shivam Singh, 23, the first in his family to speak English and to leave home for university, the language opened doors.
    


            “I wanted to get a good job… English gives you an edge. All the internships I cracked was because I could hold conversations in English.”
    


            Singh practiced his spoken English on an AI app for hours, getting feedback that helped earn him the internships.
    


            India is now home to one of the world's largest English-speaking populations, with more than 130 million people reporting English proficiency in the 2011 census. This linguistic advantage has helped attract billions in foreign investment, enabled global partnerships, and powered sectors from tech support to startups.
    


            Yet, the prominence of English has also deepened social divides. Those without language skills find themselves largely excluded from lucrative careers.
    


            Wealthier, urban, or higher-caste families are far more likely to be fluent in English and English-medium schools are mainly concentrated in urban areas, leaving rural and lower-caste communities locked out.
    


            “I am not able to find a (well-paying), because they say I do not know English,” said Vaishnavi Gujanan Narote, a housekeeper at a hotel in the capital New Delhi.
    


            She added: “If you know Hindi, then all you can do is stay here and do odd jobs, but not get a good post, because English is a requirement.”
    


            Vijay Kumar, a computer teacher at a non-government organization in Delhi, never learned the language at school. “I feel I did not get the opportunities in my life because I did not know English,” he said.
    


            The dominance of English and Hindi, along with rapid urbanization, have marginalized many of the country's indigenous languages – tongues spoken by hundreds of tribal communities now far removed from the mainstream.
    


            UNESCO classes nearly 200 Indian languages as endangered, and more than 220 languages in the country have disappeared in the last 50 years, according to the People's Linguistic Survey of India.
    


            “Many languages in India do not get the respect or place they deserve,” said Aloka Kujur, a writer and activist from Jharkhand, whose mother tongue is Kuduk, a tribal language native to the east Indian state.
    


            The proliferation of English, Kujur said, cost her community recognition in the country. Kuduk is spoken by just under 2 million people and is in a “vulnerable” state, according to UNESCO.
    


            Kujur said that in Jharkand, indigenous groups “have an affinity with their language that cannot be broken,” but notices that Kuduk's use in everyday life is slipping away.
    


            As India looks toward the future, analysts say the English language's role in the country might not be going anywhere any time soon.
    


            “There is no fear of sidelining English,” Kothari, from Ashoka University, said. “It is much too strong to be sidelined.”
    


            It's a sentiment Singh, the first student, agrees with.
    


            “We cannot afford to not learn English in India,” he said. “We are a developing country, we need to learn from the world.”

“Who they came to see?” Beyoncé asks as she performs her 2023 single “My House” during the Cowboy Carter tour. For many, the answer has been Blue Ivy.

Blue Ivy Carter, the Grammy-winning artist's 13-year-old daughter, is more present than ever on stage, and fans are impressed by the growth from her first performance years ago to now.

Isabella Kerr, 15, has admired Beyoncé for years, but said she attended the Cowboy Carter tour specifically to experience Blue Ivy's moves in person.

“People are saying, “Oh, she's a mini Beyoncé,” but no, I think she's the first Blue. Everything about her when she's on stage is electrifying,” said Kerr.

The Cowboy Carter tour concludes Saturday in Las Vegas. The tour's 30 previous shows have had fans buzzing that Blue Ivy is well on her way to being a next generation powerhouse.

Blue first graced the stage at 11 years old during her mother's 2023 Renaissance tour, appearing during the legacy-celebrating anthems “My Power” and “Black Parade.” Supporters anticipated her performance at each stop.

She performed again during “Beyoncé Bowl,” the NFL Christmas Day Halftime Show that was just nominated for four Emmy Awards. She danced alongside the icon as she performed songs from the “Cowboy Carter” album for the first time.

“Even the difference between the Renaissance Tour and now, you can tell she's really grown in her confidence,” said fan and artist Olivia Ellis. “You can tell she has a different vibe about her.”

On the Cowboy Carter tour, she can almost be mistaken for one of Beyoncé's professional dancers. She is on stage for nearly every song and has a solo recreating her mother's choreography from her 2006 “Déjà-vu” music video, a nod to the undeniable similarities between the two.

Online videos of Blue display professionalism comparable to her mother's during the Cowboy Carter tour. During a rainy New Jersey stop, she brought out towels to dry her area of the stage before nailing her “America Has a Problem” choreography.

In another unexpected moment during a Chicago show, her earring got caught on Beyoncé's hair. Blue remained calm, removed the jewelry and motioned to the singer that it was safe in her hand as they both seamlessly continued.

“It's the family business,” said Kinitra D. Brooks, an academic and author of “The Lemonade Reader,” a collection that explores the nuances of Beyoncé's 2016 visual album, “Lemonade.” “She is literally studying under the best person doing it out there today. Why wouldn't she take advantage of that opportunity?”

In “Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé,” fans were given a behind-the-scenes look at the decision-making process the first time Blue was allowed to perform. Beyoncé expressed how nervous she was about her child being in front of thousands of people made her, revealing she initially said no.

“I did not think it was an appropriate place for an 11-year-old on a stadium stage,” she said in the documentary. “I made a deal with her, and I said, ‘If you practice and you show your commitment, I'll let you do one show.'” Blue Ivy fulfilled her end of the deal, and a fan base was formed: the “Ivy League.”

Kerr says Blue's accomplishments inspire her to work harder to achieve her own dreams. “She worked to be on stage, and look at her now. If I work to what I want to be, I can be killing it like her.”

At last month's Cowboy Carter Paris stop, members of the Beyhive and Ivy League finally got what they had been asking for — Blue Ivy merchandise. Shirts with the teen's face and the phrase “Déjà Blue” plastered on the front were available for purchase.

Prior to that, fans were creating their own custom pieces that highlighted Blue and Beyoncé's connection.

At the MetLife Stadium show, Ellis wore a custom corset top she painted, showcasing Blue Ivy and her 8-year-old sister, Rumi Carter, on stage with Beyoncé during “Protector,” a track from the “Cowboy Carter” album that Rumi is featured on.

“I thought that would just be a really fun moment to highlight on a corset,” she said. “It's just really cool to see her as a mom because we've all grown up with Beyoncé, and now it's like her show is kind of like a family affair.”

Blue Ivy's confidence and professionalism are not only a testament to her hard work, but Beyoncé's motherhood.

Mother-daughter duos around the globe filled stadium seats, excited to watch Beyoncé and her daughter display their strong bond for the world to see. In many cases, the mothers have been Beyoncé fans for years and are excited for their daughters to grow up with Blue Ivy, a high-flyer for their generation.

Tanazha Baylis took her now 11-year-old daughter, Aria Brown, to the Renaissance tour, where she did not miss a beat dancing along to Blue Ivy's “My Power” choreography.

Brown was so determined to attend the Cowboy Carter Tour that she started selling popular toys, such as slime and Squishmallows, and saving her money.

“She literally was like, ‘Mom, I don't know what you're going to do, but I have to go to this concert,'” said Baylis. “I just had to make it happen after that.”

Brown became a Beyoncé fan after participating in a dance recital with a theme centered around the superstar's career throughout the years. Baylis, who says she has always been a big fan, is happy to share these experiences with her daughter.

“It just showed her a cool mom and daughter, and it's just something that she can do as well. Beyoncé is a little older but, with seeing Blue there, it made it tangible for her.”

Although there is no solid answer for what the future holds for Blue Ivy, it is widely recognized that the possibilities are limitless.

“We couldn't imagine that Beyoncé would do all of these things that she could do. All we saw were people trying to put limitations on her,” said Brooks. “I think one of the things that Beyoncé wants us to do and what she wants for Blue is for us to not put those limitations on Blue.”

Statehouses across the U.S. are addressing long-standing bathroom disparities for female lawmakers. In Kentucky, female lawmakers have limited restroom access in the Statehouse, often risking missing debates or votes. A $300 million renovation will add more bathrooms for women.

For female state lawmakers in Kentucky, choosing when to go to the bathroom has long required careful calculation.

There are only two bathroom stalls for women on the third floor of the Kentucky Statehouse, where the House and Senate chambers are located. Female legislators — 41 of the 138 member Legislature — needing a reprieve during a lengthy floor session have to weigh the risk of missing an important debate or a critical vote.

None of their male colleagues face the same dilemma because, of course, multiple men's bathrooms are available. The Legislature even installed speakers in the men's bathrooms to broadcast the chamber's events so they don't miss anything important. 

In a pinch, House Speaker David Osborne allows women to use his single stall bathroom in the chamber, but even that attracts long lines. 

“You get the message very quickly: This place was not really built for us,” said Rep. Lisa Willner, a Democrat from Louisville, reflecting on the photos of former lawmakers, predominantly male, that line her office. 

The issue of potty parity may seem comic, but its impact runs deeper than uncomfortably full bladders, said Kathryn Anthony, professor emerita at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's School of Architecture.

“It's absolutely critical because the built environment reflects our culture and reflects our population,” said Anthony, who has testified on the issue before Congress. “And if you have an environment that is designed for half the population but forgets about the other half, you have a group of disenfranchised people and disadvantaged people.”




There is hope for Kentucky's lady legislators seeking more chamber potties. 

A $300 million renovation of the 155-year-old Capitol — scheduled for completion by 2028 at the soonest — aims to create more women's restrooms and end Kentucky's bathroom disparity.

The Bluegrass State is among the last to add bathrooms to aging statehouses that were built when female legislators were not a consideration.

In the $392 million renovation of the Georgia Capitol, expanding bathroom access is a priority, said Gerald Pilgrim, chief of staff with the state's Building Authority. It will introduce female facilities on the building's fourth floor, where the public galleries are located, and will add more bathrooms throughout to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

“We know there are not enough bathrooms,” he said.

There's no federal law requiring bathroom access for all genders in public buildings. Some 20 states have statutes prescribing how many washrooms buildings must have, but historical buildings — such as statehouses — are often exempt.

Over the years, as the makeup of state governments has changed, statehouses have added bathrooms for women.

When Tennessee's Capitol opened in 1859, the architects designed only one restroom — for men only — situated on the ground floor. According to legislative librarian Eddie Weeks, the toilet could only be “flushed” when enough rainwater had been collected.

“The room was famously described as ‘a stench in the nostrils of decency,'” Weeks said in an email. 

Today, Tennessee's Capitol has a female bathroom located between the Senate and House chambers. It's in a cramped hall under a staircase, sparking comparisons to Harry Potter's cupboard bedroom, and it contains just two stalls. The men also just have one bathroom on the same floor, but it has three urinals and three stalls.

Democratic Rep. Aftyn Behn, who was elected in 2023, said she wasn't aware of the disparity in facilities until contacted by The Associated Press.

“I've apparently accepted that waiting in line for a two-stall closet under the Senate balcony is just part of the job,” she said.

“I had to fight to get elected to a legislature that ranks dead last for female representation, and now I get to squeeze into a space that feels like it was designed by someone who thought women didn't exist -- or at least didn't have bladders,” Behn said.

The Maryland State House is the country's oldest state capitol in continuous legislative use, operational since the late 1700s. Archivists say its bathroom facilities were initially intended for white men only because desegregation laws were still in place. Women's restrooms were added after 1922, but they were insufficient for the rising number of women elected to office.

Delegate Pauline Menes complained about the issue so much that House Speaker Thomas Lowe appointed her chair of the “Ladies Rest Room Committee,” and presented her with a fur covered toilet seat in front of her colleagues in 1972. She launched the women's caucus the following year.

It wasn't until 2019 that House Speaker Adrienne A. Jones, the first woman to secure the top position, ordered the addition of more women's restrooms along with a gender-neutral bathroom and a nursing room for mothers in the Lowe House Office Building.

As more women were elected nationwide in the 20th century, some found creative workarounds.

In Nebraska's unicameral Legislature, female senators didn't get a dedicated restroom until 1988, when a facility was added in the chamber's cloakroom. There had previously been a single restroom in the senate lounge, and Sen. Shirley Marsh, who served for some 16 years, would ask a State Patrol trooper to guard the door while she used it, said Brandon Metzler, the Legislature's clerk.

In Colorado, female House representatives and staff were so happy to have a restroom added in the chamber's hallway in 1987 that they hung a plaque to honor then-state Rep. Arie Taylor, the state's first Black woman legislator, who pushed for the facility.

The plaque, now inside a women's bathroom in the Capitol, reads: “Once here beneath the golden dome if nature made a call, we'd have to scramble from our seats and dash across the hall ... Then Arie took the mike once more to push an urge organic, no longer do we fret and squirm or cross our legs in panic.”

The poem concludes: “In mem'ry of you, Arie (may you never be forgot), from this day forth we'll call that room the Taylor Chamber Pot.”

New Mexico Democratic state Rep. Liz Thomson recalled missing votes in the House during her first year in office in 2013 because there was no women's restroom in the chamber's lounge. An increase in female lawmakers — New Mexico elected the largest female majority Legislature in U.S. history in 2024 — helped raise awareness of the issue, she said. 

“It seems kind of like fluff, but it really isn't,” she said. “To me, it really talks about respect and inclusion.”

The issue is not exclusive to statehouses. In the U.S. Capitol, the first restroom for congresswomen didn't open until 1962. While a facility was made available for female U.S. Senators in 1992, it wasn't until 2011 that the House chamber opened a bathroom to women lawmakers.

Jeannette Rankin of Montana was the first woman elected to a congressional seat. That happened in 1916.

Willner insists that knowing the Kentucky Capitol wasn't designed for women gives her extra impetus to stand up and make herself heard. 

“This building was not designed for me,” she said. “Well, guess what? I'm here.”

SAN DIEGO (AP) — The Grid took over Comic-Con on Friday, bringing the stars of the new “Tron: Ares” films to unveil footage and reveal the story behind the franchise's third movie.

The film stars Jared Leto, Jeff Bridges, Greta Lee and Jodie Turner-Smith as the story brings the virtual environment of the Grid, complete with light cylces, into the real world.

Disney showed off several minutes of footage, including a light cycle chase scene in the real world and another in the red-hued Grid. Propelling the onscreen action is a propulsive Nine Inch Nails soundtrack.

“It's fun to see it on the big screen for the first time,” said director Joachim Rønning.

Disney turned the Hall H panel into a spectacle, with red lasers filling the room and characters in suits with red lights entering the massive hall.

Asked what excited her about joining the “Tron” franchise, Lee responded: “I just wanted to ride a light cycle.”

Leto spoke affectionately about the original saying: “This movie just grabbed a hold of me and took me to a place that I'd never been before. It kind of rattled my imagination and it kind of showed me what was possible in the world.”

He praised Bridges and Steven Lisberger, who created “Tron” and directed the 1982 original. Lisberger attended Friday's panel and laid out his case for why the franchise remains relevant. 

“My feeling about ‘Tron' is that the most important thing is we kick this technology around artistically before it kicks us around,” Lisberger said. 




“I am weary about hearing all the grim news about the future,” he said, and the way he thinks it can be avoided is to “inspire young people what can be done with this technology.”

Friday's panel ended with the premiere of the music video for “As Alive as You Need Me to Be,” the first Nine Inch Nails song from the soundtrack.

“Tron” has never been in the top tier of sci-fi franchises. The original 1982 film starring Bridges as Kevin Flynn, a man sucked into a computer vortex known as the Grid, was admired for its ground-breaking concept and effects, and was a modest hit with moderately good reviews.

Perhaps more importantly, it won a cult following and has been maintained enough in cultural memory to remain a valuable property for Disney.

The 2010 film “Tron: Legacy,” starring Bridges and Garrett Hedlund, made more than $400 million globally. A TV show that followed, “Tron: Uprising,” lasted just one season.

Rønning has helmed other Disney franchise films: 2017's “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales” and 2019's “Maleficent: Mistress of Evil.” The Norweigan director said he was interested because he dreamed about making a sci-fi film and enjoyed the twist of “Ares” bringing the Grid into the real world.

Leto and Bridges are both Oscar winners, and Rønning is an Oscar nominee. ___

SAN DIEGO (AP) — The Grid has overtaken Comic-Con.

Disney unveiled details about “Tron: Ares,” which stars Jared Leto, Jeff Bridges and Greta Lee at an evening presentation in Comic-Con's famed Hall H. It will be the third feature film in the “Tron” franchise that kicked off with the hit 1982 film and had a 2010 sequel, “Tron: Legacy.”

The original starred Bridges as a computer hacker who gets trapped in a digital world. The Oscar-winner drew the biggest applause when introduced during the panel.

“Tron: Ares” sees the Grid breaking through the real world.

The other major presentations Friday included updates on the final season of “Outlander” and its prequel series “Outlander: Blood of My Blood,” “Alien: Earth” and “Predator: Badlands.”

An estimated 135,000 people from around the globe are expected to attend Comic-Con 2025, which runs through Sunday in downtown San Diego.

Fans on opening day got a preview of “Five Nights at Freddy's 2,” “The Toxic Avenger,” and a joke-filled session with comedians Gabriel “Fluffy” Iglesias and Jo Koy.

The Predator is on the hunt again.

Director Dan Trachtenberg brought new footage from “Predator: Badlands” to Comic-Con's Hall H, showing off an unfinished cut of the movie's first 15 minutes and bringing the film's stars.

The massive convention hall erupted in cheers at clip, which featured a family of Predators fighting. The early scenes set the stakes for the movie, which is about a Predator sent on its first hunt on an unforgiving planet.




Trachtenberg said one inspiration behind the movie was the realization that “The Predator never wins.” He wanted to see what that would look like but didn't want to make a slasher film, he said.

Elle Fanning, who plays a cyborg who spends much of the film strapped to the young Predator's back, said her first foray into sci-fi presented many new acting challenges.

“I was really strapped to his back for hours and hours,” she said.

While that was physically challenging, she said, at least she wasn't acting across from a tennis ball, which is often used to give actors a sense of the scale of computer-generated characters.

“Badlands” changed the Predator costume from previous iterations, keeping everything as a tangible costume except for the face. That allowed her to act opposite Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi, which Trachtenberg said allowed for more emotional range from the Predator.

The movie takes place on a deadly planet where Trachtenberg said all the plants and animals are trying to kill the Predator. Moderator Kevin Smith (yes, the “Clerks' director) likened it to “essentially Australia in space.”

Trachtenberg also showed a clip that will be added to the animated “Killer of Killers” movie, which will become a new end credits scene. It shows an expansive prison of cryogenically frozen beings, three of whom are the human protagonists — all killers of Predators — from the first two “Predator” movies and “Prey.”

The new scene was added to the film, which streams on Hulu Friday night.

“Predator: Badlands” arrives in theaters Nov. 7.

It won't be long before audiences get to see the Xenomorph in “Alien: Earth.” But there are some new alien life forms creator Noah Hawley will introduce in the upcoming FX series.

Hawley and the cast screened the first episode for a packed Hall H at Comic-Con to cheers and a few scared noises when a new creepy-crawly alien creature claimed its first victim.

Hawley, who created the “Fargo” series, said showing audiences new creatures is central to recapturing the feel of the original “Alien” movie.

One of the things he's good at is “understanding what the original movie made me feel and why and trying to create it anew,” he said. 

Part of the power of Ridley Scott's “Alien” is “the discovery of the life cycle of this creature,” Hawley said. He said he was trying to capture the “genetic revulsion of ‘Alien' for the first time.”

The show stars Sydney Chandler as a new life-form created when the consciousness of a young girl is transferred into an adult body with superhuman strength and speed.

Asked how she reacted to seeing the Xenomorph on set for the first time, Chandler said, “I almost peed. I became a kid again.

“A xenomorph was in my night terrors as a kid.”

The first episode introduces the doomed crew of the USS Maginot and the aftermath its crash-landing in an Earth city after some of its specimens break free.

Set in 2120, it unspools two years before the events of “Alien.” The early moments establish the world as a place controlled by massive corporations and where humans, cyborgs and synthetic humans coexist.

Babou Ceesay plays a cyborg whose mission is to protect the alien species at all costs. Humanlike, he has an arm that was likened Friday to a Swiss Army knife. 

But Ceesay said his character has been away from Earth for more than 60 years and isn't as advanced as he seems: “He's coming back to a planet where he's essentially an iPhone 1 in an iPhone 20 world.”

The show premieres Aug. 12 on FX.

The topic of the ultimate matchup between Aliens versus Predators came up during both sessions Friday. The matchup of the two fearsome aliens has been the subject of comic books, video games and a 2004 movie.

Hawley didn't spill any news about reboots.

Trachtenberg, who Smith described as the keeper of the Predator franchise now, had a simple answer: “Wouldn't it be cool?”

YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) — Cameroon 's electoral commission on Saturday rejected the candidacy of Maurice Kamto in the upcoming presidential election, fueling fears of unrest and increasing the likelihood of another Biya victory.

Kamto, a former government minister, is seen as the main challenger to long-serving President Paul Biya.

The electoral commission, ELECAM, said it approved 13 presidential candidates, excluding Kamto. No reason was given. Biya is included.

Kamto, who has two days to appeal, was considered Biya's strongest rival in past elections. He came second during the last presidential election in 2018 with 14% of the vote, while Biya cruised to victory with over 70% in an election marred by irregularities and a low turnout.

Biya, 92, the world's oldest serving head of state, said last month he would seek reelection on Oct. 12 despite rumors that his health is failing. He has been in power since 1982, nearly half his lifetime.

Biya's rule has left a lasting impact on Cameroon. His government has faced various challenges, including allegations of corruption and a deadly secessionist conflict in the nation's English-speaking provinces that has forced thousands out of school.

Fears of protests and unrest surged around Saturday's release of the list of approved candidates.

Security forces were deployed around the ELECAM headquarters and along major roads in Yaoundé, the capital, and in Douala, the economic hub.

The United Nations Department of Safety and Security had warned Friday that the announcement could trigger protests in the capital.

NEW YORK (AP) — Bryce Harper homered deep into the right-field bleachers and Kyle Schwarber hit a two-run double after New York's 10th error in five games, sparking the Philadelphia Phillies to a 9-4 win Saturday over the reeling Yankees, who avoided a major injury scare with captain Aaron Judge.

Trea Turner drove in two runs and Edmundo Sosa also homered for the Phillies, who opened a 9-1 lead. Philadelphia started the day a half-game behind the NL East-leading New York Mets.

Schwarber had six RBIs and Turner was 6 for 11 as Philadelphia outscored New York 21-9 in the first two games of the three-game series.

Ranger Suárez (8-4) allowed one run and seven hits in 5 2/3 innings with eight strikeouts and one walk, throwing a season-high 108 pitches.

Judge was out of the Yankees' starting lineup for just the second time this season. His elbow has been bothering him since a throw Tuesday at Toronto, and manager Aaron Boone said the two-time AL MVP had a scan that revealed a flexor strain but no damage to the ulnar collateral ligament. Judge will go on the injured list and be the designated hitter initially when he returns, Boone said.

New York began the day a season-high 5 1/2 games behind AL East-leading Toronto and dropped to 3-5 since the All-Star break.

Schwarber doubled after second baseman Jazz Chisholm Jr. bobbled Turner's potential inning-ending, double-play grounder in the seventh, Chisholm's 12th error this season.




Ryan McMahon went 1 for 3 with a walk in his Yankees debut, a day after the third baseman was acquired from Colorado for a pair of pitching prospects.

Marcus Stroman (2-2) allowed four runs, five hits and four walks in 3 2/3 innings.

Sosa hit a two-run homer in the seventh off Allan Winans and Giancarlo Stanton hit a two-run drive against Daniel Robert in the bottom half.

Sosa left with a bruised back after the third baseman was elbowed by left fielder Brandon Marsh in a collision while catching Chisholm's seventh-inning popup.

New York is 21-28 following a 35-20 start.

New York LHP Carlos Rodón (10-7, 3.10) and Philadelphia RHP Zack Wheeler (9-3, 2.39) start Sunday's series finale.

Gov. Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma responded to reports that some Democratic governors will no longer pay their National Governors Association (NGA) dues. 

Colorado Springs, Colo. – Incoming chair of the National Governors Association (NGA), Gov. Kevin Stitt, R-Okla., is ""disappointed"" that some Democratic governors might stop paying their dues to the bipartisan group. 

The Atlantic reported ahead of the NGA's summer meeting in Colorado Springs, Colo., that at least two Democrats, Govs. Tim Walz of Minnesota and Laura Kelly of Kansas, plan to stop paying their dues when asked to renew their membership this month over the NGA's response to President Donald Trump's second term. 

""We shouldn't be playing politics like they do in Washington, D.C.,"" Stitt told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview at the summer meeting. ""But sometimes, if you're a governor running for president or a higher office, you make it political.""

Kelly is chair of the Democratic Governors Association (DGA), the partisan gubernatorial arm that has been vocal in resisting the Trump administration. As Walz weighs a third gubernatorial run, the former vice presidential candidate has remained a leading critic of Trump's administration since losing the White House alongside Vice President Kamala Harris last year.

The Democratic discontent comes as Democratic Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado prepares to cede his chairmanship to Stitt, a Republican, at this weekend's summer meeting. Gov. Wes Moore, D-Md., is set to become vice chair.

""I would tell anybody, listen, do you want your leaders to take their ball and go home just because they get mad at something? That's not the way to solve problems,"" Stitt said, adding that he likes both Walz and Kelly. 

""Listen, this isn't the time to take our ball and go home. Let's sit down and debate what the best policies [are] going forward,"" Stitt added. 

The Oklahoma governor said it can be ""frustrating"" when Democrats are constantly targeting Trump, but as a business leader, he said there are plenty of instances in which governors can find common ground, including a reduction of the United States' more than $36 trillion in debt.

Ahead of the summer meeting, Eric Wohlschlegel, NGA communications director, emphasized the bipartisan nature of the NGA and told Fox News Digital the NGA's ""mission hasn't changed.""

According to The Atlantic report, Democratic members of the NGA complained the group ""did not respond forcefully enough"" when the Trump administration paused federal funding early this year, as Gov. Janet Mills of Maine clashed with Trump over biological men playing in women's sports and, more recently, when Trump authorized the National Guard to California to amid the anti-ICE protests. 

""Every public statement NGA issues reflects bipartisan consensus. So far this year, all but one statement has had that consensus, and when governors don't agree, we simply don't issue one. That's how we preserve our role as a bipartisan convener, a principle we won't compromise,"" Wohlschlegel explained. 

Thirteen Republican and seven Democratic leaders planned to attend the summer meeting, featuring discussions with Education Secretary Linda McMahon and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

A source familiar with the situation blamed the controversy on ""Democratic infighting, unspoken campaign jockeying and a few anonymous voices looking to reshape a nonpartisan institution into a political one.""

The source added that ""no governors are on the record expressing discontent with the NGA. No allegations of misconduct, governance failure or mismanagement have been raised.""

And without addressing the controversy directly, Conor Cahill, a spokesperson for Polis, told Fox News Digital the governor ""has been honored"" to lead the NGA and to ""work across the aisle with governors on education, permitting reform, standing up to federal efforts to strip away gubernatorial authority around the National Guard and elevating the priorities of states.""

He added that ""during this polarizing time, bipartisan organizations are needed more than ever, and NGA must continue to demonstrate value to all governors and effectively communicate governors' opinions on various matters with the public and the federal government.""

Abegail Cave, a spokesperson for Stitt, told Fox News Digital ahead of the NGA that ""people seem to forget NGA is a bipartisan organization, not a political one.""

Fox News Digital reached out to Walz and Kelly for comment but did not immediately receive a response.

Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here.


Rebecca De Mornay is not holding back when it comes to the reboot of one of her most iconic films.

The actress, 65, recently shared her reaction to the upcoming remake of the classic 1992 horror film, ""The Hand That Rocks the Cradle,"" as she was excluded from the project. De Mornay claimed that nobody reached out to her about the reboot. 

""Nobody. I found out about it, and I kind of joked that I was quite perturbed,"" De Mornay told the New York Post. ""It felt like a betrayal, like how dare you [have] somebody else be playing that part.""

De Mornay delivered a chilling performance as the vengeful nanny Peyton Flanders in the thriller, alongside Annabella Sciorra, Julianne Moore, Matt McCoy, Ernie Hudson and more. 

Despite her bold comment, the actress isn't ruling out watching the new version.

""I'm actually kind of curious to see it, to see if they can live up to what we did,"" she added.

Her comments come at a time when Hollywood continues to create remakes of fan favorites, instead of producing original stories.

De Mornay continued to slam the Hollywood reboots, as she recently starred in the thriller ""Saint Clare,"" opposite Bella Thorne and Ryan Phillippe. 

""New stories seem to be impossible for people to come up with. That's why I really like ‘Saint Clare.' It's new. I haven't seen anything like it before,"" she explained.

""There's a kind of laziness of falling [into] ‘Oh, well, that works. So let's just do that one again,' rather than coming up with a new story. So that kind of bugs me a little,"" she admitted.

A film remake that De Mornay did enjoy was ""A Star is Born.""

The beloved musical drama has seen multiple versions on the big screen since its original debut in 1937. In 1951, the project was created for television with Kathleen Crowley and Conrad Nagel in the lead roles. 

Just a few years later, the story returned with Judy Garland and James Mason in the 1954 classic. 

Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson offered their own spin in 1976, while Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper drew in a new generation with their 2018 rendition.

""We tend to think a movie is one cast. I guess it doesn't have to be, if it's a really good story, a good script,"" she said. ""I guess, it doesn't have to, but I just wish that there was also more imagination with new scripts, because it feels like people are just falling back on what once were.""

Fox News senior national correspondent Rich Edson reports on the newly declassified Russiagate documents, Democrats' dismissal of the ‘historic scandal' and more on ‘Special Report.'

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard declassified a slew of documents this month, revealing that Obama administration officials ""manufactured"" intelligence to push the Trump-Russia collusion narrative.

Here's a look at the newly declassified records:

Documents revealed that in the months leading up to the November 2016 election, the intelligence community consistently assessed that Russia was ""probably not trying … to influence the election by using cyber means.""

One instance was on Dec. 7, 2016, weeks after the election. Then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper's talking points stated, ""Foreign adversaries did not use cyberattacks on election infrastructure to alter the U.S. presidential election outcome.""

Fox News Digital obtained a declassified copy of the Presidential Daily Brief, which was prepared by the Department of Homeland Security, with reporting from the CIA, Defense Intelligence Agency, FBI, National Security Agency, Department of Homeland Security, State Department and open sources, for Obama, dated Dec. 8, 2016.

""We assess that Russian and criminal actors did not impact recent U.S. election results by conducting malicious cyber activities against election infrastructure,"" the Presidential Daily Brief stated. ""Russian Government-affiliated actors most likely compromised an Illinois voter registration database and unsuccessfully attempted the same in other states.""

But the brief stated that it was ""highly unlikely"" the effort ""would have resulted in altering any state's official vote result.""

""Criminal activity also failed to reach the scale and sophistication necessary to change election outcomes,"" it stated. 

The brief noted that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence assessed that any Russian activities ""probably were intended to cause psychological effects, such as undermining the credibility of the election process and candidates.""

The brief stated that cyber criminals ""tried to steal data and to interrupt election processes by targeting election infrastructure, but these actions did not achieve a notable disruptive effect.""

Fox News Digital obtained declassified, but redacted, communications from the FBI in the Presidential Daily Brief, stating that it ""should not go forward until the FBI"" had shared its ""concerns.""

Those communications revealed that the FBI drafted a ""dissent"" to the original Presidential Daily Brief.

The communications revealed that the brief was expected to be published Dec. 9, 2016, the following day, but later communications revealed the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, ""based on some new guidance,"" decided to ""push back publication"" of the Presidential Daily Brief. 

""It will not run tomorrow and is not likely to run until next week,"" wrote the deputy director of the Presidential Daily Brief at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, whose name is redacted. 

The following day, Dec. 9, 2016, a meeting convened in the White House Situation Room, with the subject line starting: ""Summary of Conclusions for PC Meeting on a Sensitive Topic (REDACTED.)""

The meeting included top officials in the National Security Council, Clapper, then-CIA Director John Brennan, then-National Security Advisor Susan Rice, then-Secretary of State John Kerry, then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch, then-Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, among others, to discuss Russia.

The declassified meeting record, obtained by Fox News Digital, revealed that principals ""agreed to recommend sanctioning of certain members of the Russian military intelligence and foreign intelligence chains of command responsible for cyber operations as a response to cyber activity that attempted to influence or interfere with U.S. elections, if such activity meets the requirements"" from an executive order that demanded the blocking of property belonging to people engaged in cyber activities.

After the meeting, according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Clapper's executive assistant emailed intelligence community leaders tasking them to create a new intelligence community assessment ""per the president's request"" that detailed the ""tools Moscow used and actions it took to influence the 2016 election.""

""ODNI will lead this effort with participation from CIA, FBI, NSA, and DHS,"" the record states.

Later, Obama officials ""leaked false statements to media outlets"" claiming that ""Russia has attempted through cyber means to interfere in, if not actively influence, the outcome of an election.""

By Jan. 6, 2017, a new Intelligence Community Assessment was released that, according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, ""directly contradicted the IC assessments that were made throughout the previous six months."" 

Intelligence officials told Fox News Digital that the ICA was ""politicized"" because it ""suppressed intelligence from before and after the election showing Russia lacked intent and capability to hack the 2016 election."" 

Officials also said it deceived the American public ""by claiming the IC made no assessment on the ‘impact' of Russian activities,"" when the intelligence community ""did, in fact, assess for impact."" 

""The unpublished December PDB stated clearly that Russia ‘did not impact' the election through cyber hacks on the election,"" an official told Fox News Digital.

The official also said the ICA had assessed that ""Russia was responsible for leaking data from the DNC and DCCC,"" while ""failing to mention that FBI and NSA previously expressed low confidence in this attribution."" 

Officials said the intelligence was ""politicized"" and then ""used as the basis for countless smears seeking to delegitimize President Trump's victory, the years-long Mueller investigation, two Congressional impeachments, high level officials being investigated, arrested, and thrown in jail, heightened US-Russia tensions, and more.""

A report prepared by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in 2020 said the intelligence community did not have any direct information that Russian President Vladimir Putin wanted to help elect Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election, but, at the ""unusual"" direction of then-President Barack Obama, published ""potentially biased"" or ""implausible"" intelligence suggesting otherwise.

The report, based on an investigation launched by former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., was dated Sept. 18, 2020. At the time of the publication of the report, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., was the chairman of the committee.

The report has never before been released to the public and instead has remained highly classified within the intelligence community.

Fox News Digital obtained the ""fully-sourced limited-access investigation report that was drafted and stored in a limited-access vault at CIA Headquarters."" The report includes some redactions.

BRENNAN DIRECTED PUBLICATION OF 'IMPLAUSIBLE' REPORTS CLAIMING PUTIN PREFERRED TRUMP IN 2016, HOUSE FOUND

The committee focused on the creation of the Intelligence Community Assessment of 2017, in which then-CIA Director John Brennan pushed for the inclusion of the now-discredited anti-Trump dossier despite knowing it was based largely on ""internet rumor,"" as Fox News Digital previously reported.

According to the report, the ICA was a ""high-profile product ordered by the President, directed by senior IC agency heads, and created by just five CIA analysts, using one principal drafter.""

""Production of the ICA was subject to unusual directives from the President and senior political appointees, and particularly DCIA,"" the report states. ""The draft was not properly coordinated within CIA or the IC, ensuring it would be published without significant challenges to its conclusions.""

The committee found that the five CIA analysts and drafter ""rushed"" the ICA's production ""in order to publish two weeks before President-elect Trump was sworn-in.""

""Hurried coordination and limited access to the draft reduced opportunities for the IC to discover misquoting of sources and other tradecraft concerns,"" the report states.

The report states that Brennan ""ordered the post-election publication of 15 reports containing previously collected but unpublished intelligence, three of which were substandard — containing information that was unclear, of uncertain origin, potentially biased, or implausible — and those became foundational sources for the ICA judgements that Putin preferred Trump over Clinton.""

""The ICA misrepresented these reports as reliable, without mentioning their significant underlying flaws,"" the committee found.

""One scant, unclear, and unverifiable fragment of a sentence from one of the substandard reports constitutes the only classified information cited to suggest Putin ‘aspired' to help Trump win,"" the report states, adding that the ICA ""ignored or selectively quoted reliable intelligence reports that challenged — and in some cases undermined — judgments that Putin sought to elect Trump.""

The report also states that the ICA ""failed to consider plausible alternative explanations of Putin's intentions indicated by reliable intelligence and observed Russian actions.""

The committee also found that two senior CIA officers warned Brennan that ""we don't have direct information that Putin wanted to get Trump elected.""

Despite those warnings, the Obama administration moved to publish the ICA.

The ICA ""did not cite any report where Putin directly indicated helping Trump win was the objective.""

The ICA, according to the report, excluded ""significant intelligence"" and ""ignored or selectively quoted"" reliable intelligence in an effort to push the Russia narrative.

The report also includes intelligence from a longtime Putin confidant who explained to investigators that ""Putin told him he did not care who won the election,"" and that Putin ""had often outlined the weaknesses of both major candidates.""

The report also states that the ICA omitted context showing that the claim that Putin preferred Trump was ""implausible —if not ridiculous.""

The committee also found that the ICA suppressed intelligence that showed that Russia was actually planning for a Hillary Clinton victory because ""they knew where (she) stood"" and believed Russia ""could work with her.""

The committee also noted that the ICA ""did not address why Putin chose not to leak more discrediting material on Clinton, even as polls tightened in the final weeks of the election.""

The committee also found that the ICA suppressed intelligence showing that Putin was ""not only demonstrating a clear lack of concern for Trump's election fate,"" but also indicated ""that he preferred to see Secretary Clinton elected, knowing she would be a more vulnerable President.""

One section of the declassified House Intelligence Committee report states that the material in Putin's possession included Russian intelligence on Democratic National Committee information allegedly showing that senior Democratic leaders found Clinton's health to be ""extraordinarily alarming."" 

""As of September 2016, the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service had DNC information that President Obama and Party leaders found the state of Secretary Clinton's health to be ‘extraordinarily alarming,' and felt it could have ‘serious negative impact' on her election prospects,"" the report states. ""Her health information was being kept in ‘strictest secrecy' and even close advisors were not being fully informed."" 

The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service also allegedly had DNC communications that showed that ""Clinton was suffering from ‘intensified psycho-emotional problems, including uncontrolled fits of anger, aggression, and cheerfulness.'""

""Clinton was placed on a daily regimen of ‘heavy tranquilizers' and while afraid of losing, she remained ‘obsessed with a thirst for power,'"" the report states.

The Russians also allegedly had information that Clinton ""suffered from ‘Type 2 diabetes, Ischemic heart disease, deep vein thrombosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.'""

HILLARY CLINTON AIDE DISMISSES TULSI GABBARD'S CLAIMS AS 'RIDICULOUS'

The Russians also allegedly possessed a ""campaign email discussing a plan approved by Secretary Clinton to link Putin and Russian hackers to candidate Trump in order to ‘distract the American public' from the Clinton email server scandal."" 

Gabbard, during the White House press briefing Wednesday, said there were ""high-level DNC emails that detailed evidence of Hillary's, quote, psycho-emotional problems, uncontrolled fits of anger, aggression and cheerfulness, and that then-Secretary Clinton was allegedly on a daily regimen of heavy tranquilizers.""

A tranquilizer is a drug used to reduce mental disturbance, such as anxiety and tension. Tranquilizers are typically prescribed to individuals suffering from anxiety, sleep disturbances and related conditions affecting their mental and physical health. 

A Clinton aide dismissed the claims as ""ridiculous."" 

Neither Clinton nor Obama responded to Fox News Digital's requests for comment.

Jennifer Rogers-Etcheverry, Rogers' great-granddaughter, tells Fox News Digital that making movies ‘paid the bills' for the country boy at heart.

At the time of his death, '30s star Will Rogers was the highest-paid actor in Hollywood, but all he really wanted was to be a cowboy, according to his great-granddaughter, Jennifer Rogers-Etcheverry. 

""I think the Hollywood scene paid the bills,"" Rogers-Etcheverry, who lives in her great-grandfather's native Oklahoma, where he is known as ""Oklahoma's favorite son,"" told Fox News Digital. 

""And he was contracted with Fox to make several movies, which he did not get to finish his contract, but he would crank them out just so he could go travel, go right on the ranch, go play polo, go do something.""

Rogers owned a 186-acre ranch in the Pacific Palisades, California, that burned down in January in the Los Angeles fires.

""I don't think that his passion was being a movie star,"" Rogers-Etcheverry said. ""His passion was out being with the people."" 

Rogers was the highest-paid actor who had made more than 70 movies when he died in a plane crash in 1935 at 55 years old. But he was also an author and a newspaper columnist with more than 40 million readers a day, and he wrote six books. 

""I don't know when the man slept,"" Rogers-Etcheverry joked. ""But he just, he wanted to see everything. He wanted to go, and making the movies paid the bills.""

Despite being friendly with celebrities like Clark Gable and Walt Disney and hobnobbing with presidents and kings and queens, Rogers-Etcheverry says he was a ""common man.""

""And he never forgot where he came from in Oklahoma,"" she said. ""He never forgot being a cowboy. That's all he ever wanted to be was a cowboy. And I think he just stuck to his roots. And going from just being a cowboy on a ranch in Oologah, Oklahoma, to the No. 1 box office star … in Hollywood and just, he never got that attitude or that arrogance.""

""He never forgot where he came from in Oklahoma. He never forgot being a cowboy.""

She said her grandfather always told her that when Rogers came back to his ranch, ""he was Dad, he was not Will Rogers. And he just shut it all off and was a dad. He was just a nice, good ‘ol boy."" 

Rogers got his start in the entertainment business by trick-roping in a Wild West show in Texas, and then he was hired for the Ziegfeld Follies in New York. 

""As he said, he entertained the audience by trick-roping while the girls changed from nothing into nothing, and he was told not to say a word,"" she said.

She said one time, when he messed up a trick that he joked, ""'Hey guys, sorry I got all my feet through but one,' and the audience laughed, and he immediately fueled off that laughter.""

Rogers-Etcheverry said it was ""at that moment where he knew he could entertain people.""

Soon after, he got a speaking role, quoting what he'd read in the newspapers, making fun of the president of the United States and more until celebrities started coming to his show, which were always sold out, she said. 

""And it just led from there,"" Rogers-Etcheverry said. ""And then he eventually got contracted into the movies and moved to California.""

Aside from starring in dozens of silent films and talkies, like ""A Connecticut Yankee"" with Maureen O'Sullivan and ""Steamboat Round the Bend,"" Rogers was also an avid flying enthusiast who was friends with aviator Charles Lindbergh.

After the infamous Lindbergh baby kidnapping and murder, Rogers invited the aviator's family to stay at his California ranch so they could have some privacy.

""Because, of course, the press was all over it,"" Rogers-Etcheverry explained. ""So, he kind of took them in and kept them there. And they did stay there. And I don't know exactly how long they stayed there, but they did spend quite a bit of time there when all that was happening.""

Rogers died in a plane crash in Alaska while surveying mail routes with Oklahoma aviator Wiley Post in August 1935, and it ""shut down not only the United States, it shut down the world,"" Rogers-Etcheverry said. 

""At the time of his death, he was not only the most famous person in America, he truly was the most famous man in the world. Everyone knew who he was, and he had visited every country. He was the unofficial humanitarian for the United States.""

When she got involved in the family business, keeping Rogers' memory alive, Rogers-Etcheverry said that people who were older told her they remembered being children when Rogers died.

""And they said to me, ‘That's the only time I've ever seen my dad cry or my mom cry.' They were devastated. And I think it was because he was a man that just, he made you feel good. He brought people together in a way that no one has ever been able to do since.""

Rogers' widow, Betty, donated his ranch and land to the state in 1944, and it became Will Rogers State Historic Park, which still attracts celebrities to this day, Rogers-Etcheverry said.

She said she took over the role of family representative for Rogers years ago.

""I want to keep his legacy alive. I have two children and two grandchildren, and if it wasn't for me, they would have no idea who Will Rogers is,"" she said. 

""You know, in Oklahoma it's a little bit easier. He's Oklahoma's favorite son, and there's not anything back here that isn't named after him. But you get outside the state, it's a little more challenging.""

Steve Cohen, who is executive producing the new documentary ""Billy Joel: And So it Goes,"" said that his fingers are crossed that the 76-year-old will perform again after his brain disorder diagnosis. 

Billy Joel said he was ""devastated"" when second wife Christie Brinkley left him during their nine-year marriage that ended in divorce in 1994. 

""I realized love is not concrete,"" the ""Uptown Girl"" singer told the producers in the second part of his documentary ""Billy Joel: And So it Goes."" He added, ""You know, you feel like it is, but there are things eating away at it, and in the end it all catches up. And it's hard. And I was so devastated."" 

An obviously emotional Brinkley said she had tried.

""I wanted it to work. I knew how lucky I was, having music and all that, but it just didn't work,"" she explained. 

The former couple met in 1983 in St. Barts. They married in 1985 and soon had their only daughter, Alexa Ray Joel.  

""Our relationship went from lots of fun and really totally enjoying each other to his work consuming him, and if I did go on the road, I wasn't seeing him because the unwind period after the show was going on so late into the night, and it's like ‘What am I even doing here?'"" Brinkley said. ""And I just got like ‘I don't even know what to do, but I can't be lonely just me and Alexa in this big old house that was supposed to be so full of life and love and music and laughter and all that.' Things were starting to deteriorate.""

Joel said it was a hard time for him because they were newly married and had a young daughter, but he was on the road a lot of the time.

""I realized love is not concrete. You know, you feel like it is, but there are things eating away at it, and in the end it all catches up. And it's hard. And I was so devastated.""

""I was in a relationship with someone who I cared deeply about, but I was not able to be at home,"" he said. ""I was not able to be with my family. It was a very sad time for me.""

The 76-year-old said he thinks his daughter knew he and Brinkley were going to split up.

""And for a child that's a very traumatic thing,"" he said.

Joel's own parents divorced when he was 8 years old, around the same age as Alexa when he and Brinkley divorced in 1994, but Joel's father left after the divorce, and he didn't see him again until he was in his 20s.

""I don't think it's a secret that his drinking got pretty bad, and he couldn't really remember what he did when he was drinking, so he didn't really know how he could hurt people,"" Brinkley added. 

She said she would pretend to be asleep when he came into their bedroom drunk, ""‘cause I didn't want to see him in that condition.""

Holding back tears, she added, ""One night, we had an argument and I said, ‘I really can't take this anymore, and I'm just going to take Alexa back up to New York and leave, and he said, ‘Yeah, fine, go.'"" 

""True love isn't always floating on clouds and ecstasy,"" Joel told the producers over the lyrics of ""And So it Goes."" 

""A lot of it's pain."" 

Joel would go on to marry celebrity chef Katie Lee in 2004. They divorced five years later, and he married his current wife, Alexis Roderick, in 2015. They share two daughters. Before his marriage to Brinkley, Joel was married to Elizabeth Small from 1973 until 1983.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Stephen Colbert should be fired now. Here's why","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/in_focus/3482414/stephen-colbert-should-be-fired-now-cbs-paramount/","Sat, 26 Jul 2025 18:00:00 GMT","

Let's say you decided during an all-hands company meeting to publicly accuse your bosses of being bribed. You have no evidence to back up this claim, but you go ahead and attempt to humiliate them on a daily basis anyway. 

Let's also say you're running a division in the company that is losing $40 million per year. You have a bloated staff of more than 100 people while your competitor has a staff of less than 10 to produce a rival product, and that competitor is kicking your butt while actually making money for its parent company.  

And then let's say your job is to make people laugh. But instead, you just go on angry screeds day after day while focusing on one person for 10 straight years. 

Add it all up: 

— You're a petulant, insubordinate employee who routinely rips your superiors 

— You're also losing your company boatloads of cash 

— And you're not doing the job you were tasked to do by actually producing comedy

Should you be fired? 

Or should you keep your job for another 10 months and continue to cost the company tens of millions of dollars, while criticizing the very people paying you in the most personal and sophomoric ways possible?

Apparently, for CBS and Paramount, the plan is to do the latter and keep Stephen Colbert on the air until next May.

That said, know this: If I were running that network, Colbert would've already been fired. And to quote The Godfather, it's nothing personal, just business.

How could I continue to hemorrhage money and allow my late-night host to make a spectacle of my network for the next 40 weeks? Why not simply pay out this contract and save $20 million annually by turning the page on what has been the biggest embarrassment to late-night television we have ever witnessed? 

For some odd reason, it somehow costs $2.5 million per episode to produce The Late Show with Stephen Colbert each night. How can that be? Ninety-five percent of the show involves two people having a conversation. So where is all that money being spent exactly? 

You could put two YouTubers speaking to each other at a desk for almost no cost, and offer content more interesting than Colbert talking to Bernie Sanders (I-VT) or Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) about fighting the oligarchy. 

Overall, Colbert's show costs $130 million annually to produce, which is easily the highest of any program at CBS. 

Meanwhile, Colbert is finishing a distant second to Fox's Greg Gutfeld and has for some time now. In a related story, Gutfeld's entire staff is a fraction of that of Colbert's, making it infinitely cheaper to produce. And Gutfeld's show is actually funny and often books comedians as its guests and, for the most part, it provides levity and perspective on pop culture issues and people instead of myopically lecturing audiences about the alleged threat Donald Trump poses to democracy. 

Recently, Paramount and CBS settled a lawsuit with President Donald Trump for $16 million. The company got off easy, considering what Trump had rightly alleged: 60 Minutes, the CBS News broadcast news magazine, had deceptively edited an interview with (installed) Democratic nominee Kamala Harris to make her sound cogent. 

CBS refused to release the transcript for months because they knew it would implicate the program of exactly what Trump had alleged: a clear attempt at election interference by literally replacing one answer by their preferred candidate with another. 

Nonetheless, because Trump is involved, Colbert has accused executives at Paramount and CBS of being bought off. 

“I believe this kind of complicated financial settlement with a sitting government official has a technical name in legal circles: It's a big, fat bribe,” Colbert claimed directly to the camera on The Late Show last week. 

On Monday, after a full weekend of mostly sympathetic media coverage of his cancellation, Colbert went back on the air Monday night to deliver a message to Trump after the president celebrated the news of his eventual ouster. 

“How dare you, sir? Would an untalented man be able to compose the following satirical witticism?” Colbert asked, before turning to the camera and saying, “Go f*** yourself!” 

That sound you hear is Johnny Carson turning over in his grave. Is this supposed to be funny? And it's a long way from Colbert's touching monologue following Trump's victory in the 2016 election. 

“How did our politics get so poisonous?” he asked during a special that included him crying over Trump's improbable victory? “I think it's because we overdosed, especially this year. We drank too much of the poison.”

Talk about a person in need of a mirror. For 10 years, poison can only describe the content of Colbert's show, which has included him comparing Trump supporters to the Taliban, repeatedly mocking first lady Melania Trump, and offering nightly accusations of Trump himself being an agent of Russia and a sexual puppet of Putin's. 

Yep, not poisonous at all. 

On Tuesday night, Colbert continued to pound his bosses, calling CBS “morally bankrupt” while insisting his firing had nothing to do with the $40 million Colbert was losing for the company each year. 

“One bright spot for Trump in the news right now is how much he's making my network crawl,” he said to cheers from the studio audience. 

Kevin O'Leary, a highly successful businessman and investor and a staple on cable news for his common-sense analysis, said this of Colbert's accusatory rhetoric. 

“You don't insult your boss before cashing your check. If I ran CBS, I'd fire him in four seconds. Let him sue. If you're not funny and you're bleeding money, you're gone,” he told CNN. 

Colbert's fans posing as journalists in the media don't feel the same way, framing the firing as a free speech problem. 

Salon headline: “If a comedian can't make jokes about the president, who can?” 

CNN's Brian Stelter: “A country where you can't lampoon the president is not a free country. Of course, we're not there, not even close, in the U.S., but there's a bit of a chill in the air today.”

Former NPR Chief Vivian Schiller: “We have to make note that Stephen Colbert is unafraid to, again, speak truth to power. He does it in a very bipartisan way over the years, and comedy and parody is an important part of a democratic ecosystem.”

Wait, what? Colbert “does it in a very bipartisan way?” What planet does she live on? 

A Media Research Center study reviewed every joke on late-night television from Sept. 3 through Oct. 25, leading up to the 2024 presidential election, told by Colbert, NBC's Seth Meyers, and ABC's Jimmy Kimmel. Of 1,463 jokes, 1,428 targeted Trump, or 98% of all jokes. 

That's about as “bipartisan” as NPR's content. 

In the end, just look at the numbers. On Tuesday night, Colbert, despite massive media coverage and being billed as a maverick martyr on his way out the door, drew just 2.3 million total viewers. In the key 25 to 54 demographic that advertisers base their ad buys on, he drew just 252,000 viewers. 

For contrast, Gutfeld drew 3.1 million viewers, or 800,00 more, and 300,000 in the key demographic despite Fox News being in fewer homes than CBS. 

This ain't about the First Amendment. This ain't about Trump suddenly being offended by a comic who has targeted him for more than 10 years. 

This is about performance. It's also about class. 

Stephen Colbert's performance has been pitiful. The millions lost by CBS underscore that perfectly. 

As for class, Colbert is also lacking in that department. 

CBS and Paramount shouldn't put up with a public smear campaign by their most disgruntled employee for even one more day. 

MAKE LATE NIGHT TV SHOWS FUNNY AGAIN

Show Stephen the door. 

Because that appears to be exactly what he wants.

A federal judge denied on Friday the Trump administration's attempts to make Chicago shed its “sanctuary city” status and assist the federal government's immigration efforts.

United States District Judge Lindsay Jenkins said the lawsuit, filed by the Trump administration against the state of Illinois, would encroach upon states' autonomy.

The judge cited the principles of “dual sovereignty,” determining it was “impossible to ignore the state sovereignty concerns” that would arise if the Trump administration's policy overtook state and local rules.

She also said the effort was an “end-run around the Tenth Amendment,” which protects states from any federal government overreach.

Illinois passed a law in 2021 prohibiting local or state officials from sharing a person's custody status, release date, or contact information with federal immigration officials. The Justice Department believes federal law overrides that law and other sanctuary policies, but Jenkins disagreed.

Several large cities run by Democrats have refused to assist the federal government in their immigration efforts in the past, earning the moniker “sanctuary cities” for harboring illegal immigrants.

Chicago, New York City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco are among the “sanctuary” cities.

The Trump administration has targeted cities for their sanctuary policies, hoping to force them to relent and assist with their mass deportation effort. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced on Thursday that the Department of Justice would sue New York City Mayor Eric Adams over the city's sanctuary policies after an off-duty Border Patrol officer was shot during an attempted robbery.

“The Department of Justice is suing New York City and Mayor Eric Adams for continuing to obstruct law enforcement with sanctuary city policies. If New York's leaders won't step up to protect their citizens, we will,” she wrote in a post on X.

The DOJ tried to include Gov. JB Pritzker (D-IL) in their case against Illinois, but the judge dismissed him as she found no legal basis for his inclusion.

Pritzker has been antagonistic to the Trump administration's immigration efforts.

Chinese financiers and operators are behind a surge of illegal marijuana grow operations that have sprung up across Maine, according to Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME).

Collins has led the charge to stand up a joint federal, state, and local operation to take down the hundreds of confirmed grow houses in her backyard. Since 2022, her small New England home state has had 270 confirmed illegal marijuana grow operations uncovered by authorities, but Collins is particularly concerned with who is behind them.

“It is a marijuana operation, illegally operated by a transnational Chinese criminal organization, and likely with the knowledge of the Chinese Communist Party,” Collins told the Washington Examiner. “This was very disturbing.”

Collins has finally started to see meaningful progress made in the months since President Donald Trump took office, but getting here has been a yearslong effort that Collins and others involved shared the details of.

Until recently, rural Central Maine was a hub for the grow houses, and Maine itself was a national leader for states affected by this type of crime.

Unlike in other leading states for illegal marijuana grow operations, such as California and Oklahoma, where Latin criminal organizations known as cartels were behind the operations, that was not the case in Maine. Chinese workers staffed these and, as investigations would reveal, they were run and financed by Chinese businessmen, according to Collins and the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Trouble first appeared on Collins's radar in June 2022, when she was contacted by a constituent about suspicious activity at a nearby home. Collins began working with the DEA around that time to get federal law enforcement involved.

Collins said that Sheriff Dale Lancaster of Somerset County also received a high volume of public reports of heavy traffic going in and out of homes in the countryside. Lancaster could not be reached for comment.

Local authorities began sharing their observations: homes with electric bills higher than a motel's, unusual smells around certain houses, lots of Chinese people coming and going all at once every few weeks in a predominantly white area, according to Richard LaBelle, town manager for Norridgewock, Maine's 3,300 residents.

“They purchased these homes. Some of them were cash. Some of them they had mortgages on, and they were coming in and not seeking any permits or anything like that. They were just retrofitting these homes,” LaBelle said.

“You were seeing commercial electricity drops brought into the homes. They were covering windows, doors, and walls with insulation,” LaBelle said. “They were really setting up these makeshift grows. Some folks were distributing. Some folks were cultivating.… some of these buildings were primarily housing.”

Maine is one of the few states that allows residents to grow marijuana legally. Residents over 21 may grow up to six mature plants, but anyone who grows it for medical use is exempt from those caps.

The state's caregiver program for growing marijuana allows residents to grow large amounts of marijuana legally. It also gave illegal growers some cover since, from an outsider's perspective, the grow could be for medical purposes.

But this was different and not for medical reasons, according to Paul Spera, special agent in charge at the DEA.

“Maine marijuana goes to Massachusetts and New York — lots of different organizations. Some of it stays in Maine, being sold to undercut the legitimate market. Legal stuff has to be taxed, but black market stuff doesn't,” Spera said in a phone call.

Houses that were converted into grow houses are covered in black mold inside, according to all three officials. It destroyed the homes past repair from future habitation and took what was once a perfectly good home off the real estate market, particularly at a time when Maine has an affordable housing shortage, Collins said.

“I personally think Maine made a mistake in legalizing cannabis, but at least it did so with a regulatory framework that is intended to regulate the amount of THC, the amount of pesticides, the type of herbicides … those regulations, obviously, are not followed at all by these illegal grow houses,” Collins said.

LaBelle described the difficulty of addressing the problem when it was out of sight. To complicate matters further, the county sheriff's department was responsible for several communities across a 300-mile area and was spread thin.

In August 2023, Collins and other Maine lawmakers took action and sent then-U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland a letter calling on the Justice Department to shut down what had been confirmed to be illegally run marijuana grow operations.

Collins wanted federal assistance because local and state law enforcement could not adequately address the problem. When the state intervened, growers were fined for violating state law. Sometimes, the growers declared their status as medical growers to avoid getting into trouble or would shut down operations and take everything out of the house overnight, leaving it beyond repair.

Conversations with the DEA continued as the DOJ remained quiet, prompting Collins to send additional letters to Garland and then-U.S. Attorney for the District of Maine Darcie McElwee from 2023 into early 2024. The DOJ promised to look into it in April 2024.

Collins put Garland on the spot during a public Senate hearing that same month and asked what the Biden administration was doing about it.

“This is a really serious threat to public health and to our national security,” Collins said in a phone call.

The DEA has been inside 50 to 100 grow houses in Maine since 2023, according to Spera, and helped local and state police as they responded and began investigations into the bigger picture of what was going on.

For the federal agents, the goal has been dismantling organizations, not going after individuals. That also means federal prosecutors and support from the DOJ, which Collins said she was still not seeing.

In June 2024, then-FBI Director Christopher Wray confirmed to Collins what she had suspected: “We are starting to see, as we unpack this more, more ties of a lot of these growing operations and Chinese organized crime.”

Despite Collins' best efforts, the DOJ had not done much, if anything, to address the situation, she said, until the Trump administration took office in January.

“It was very frustrating to me in the previous administration that I could not secure the kind of help that Maine needed — that Maine sheriffs and local law enforcement needed — to close down what are estimated to be, at that time, some 200 grow houses in my state,” Collins said. “We had a hard time getting prosecutions, getting investigations, and just getting the resources.”

Earlier this year, FBI Director Kash Patel and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem both committed to working with Maine to shut down the grow operations.

In early July, the DOJ charged seven Chinese nationals in a multi-million dollar conspiracy to cultivate and distribute marijuana across the New England region by using grow houses concealed inside single-family properties in Maine and Massachusetts. Federal prosecutors alleged that the Chinese nationals were smuggled into the United States to work in the grow houses without access to their passports until they repaid the smugglers who got them into the country.

“We're seeing a big, a big difference in how seriously the federal government is taking this problem,” Collins said.

A DOJ official added in an email to the Washington Examiner that illegal grow houses now appear to number less than 50 statewide.

An enlightening analysis by pollsters John and Jim McLaughlin suggests that how voters view President Donald Trump six months into the job is largely influenced by which media they rely on.

If Fox and Newmax are the source, Trump is on a great run, scoring big wins. If it's CNN and MSNBC, he is sinking under the weight of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal.

In their opinion piece for Newsmax, the pollsters said that the media-fed political divide has stalled Trump's rise in polls.

They wrote, “despite legislative wins and economic improvements, Trump's approval ratings face a ceiling.”

They gave two reasons:

Take the direction of the nation as an example. They said that consumers of center-right media think things are fine, with 69% feeling that the country is headed in the right direction. Meanwhile, just 30% of those who consume liberal media agree.

In this week's White House Report Card, our graders show exactly what the McLaughlins have found.

Democratic pollster John Zogby, in grading the week an “F,” said the Epstein scandal is dragging Trump down. “Glug” was his rating on his “Drowning Meter.” Conservative grader Jed Babbin, giving the president an A-minus, said the affair rates a big “meh,” and said Trump is getting a lot done, especially in calling out those who have long tried to undermine him, notably former President Barack Obama.

Jed Babbin

Grade: A-

President Donald Trump got the best news he'd received since Hillary Rodham Clinton lost the 2016 election. As proven by the newly-declassified documents released by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, the whole Russia hoax was definitely the product of the Obama-Clinton gang.

The Russia hoax was created out of whole cloth, lies from beginning to end. It alleged that Trump was in league with Russian President Vladimir Putin and that by their collusion, Putin intended to tilt the election toward Trump. That was a huge lie. Putin wanted Hillary to be president (duh!) because she was vastly weaker than Trump and he could play her like a fiddle. There was no truth in the liberal hoax, nor in the congressional investigations and the special prosecutors.

It was all nonsense but had a profound slowing effect on Trump and his whole first term as president. What he needs now is like what Doc Holliday prescribed for Wyatt Earp as the good guys began to win in Tombstone. Trump needs a reckoning. It's a word you should look up. Its meaning may surprise you.

There was lots of other news. Ukraine arms shipments have resumed. Congress went home rather than deal with the Jeffrey Epstein files. (If Trump had been in them anywhere, Biden would have leaked the files joyously.) Meh. Too much blather and too little substance.

John Zogby

Grade: F

We began the week with a statement from the brother of a convicted pedophile saying that his brother (Jeffrey Epstein) ended his friendship with future President Donald Trump because he was a “crook.” And it doesn't get any better for Trump as the Epstein affair spreads.

He denied he sent a friendly birthday card to Epstein with a lewd cartoon, emphatically arguing that it could not have been him because he didn't doodle. But we got to see that the president is actually quite a good doodler and some were auctioned off for charity.

Then we saw a flurry of pictures of the future president all smiles with Epstein and his “associate,” convicted child trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. For her part, Maxwell was deposed by Trump's former attorney, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche this week.

This movie is getting tiresome and the president and his toadies in Congress have ensured that it will be shown every day through September.

The president had a photo op with the chair of the Federal Reserve this week, chastising him for the costs of renovations to taxpayers — including one made five years ago. Fed chairs are supposed to be independent and presidents are not supposed to confront them — even suggesting that they are going to not renew them for another term.

But that is tame compared with Trump's reaction to calls for release of all documents related to his relationship with Epstein. He also argued that his predecessor Barack Obama should be investigated for treason trying to pull off a coup against the newly elected Trump in 2017. He ordered the release of classified files dealing with the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, much to the dismay of the King family.

But that is not all. His recently passed budget cut resettlement programs for Afghan refugees who helped U.S. troops as translators and guides and now threatens them with deportation and possible death. It will also immediately reduce the numbers of Americans with health insurance by 11 million, threatening the quality of healthcare they receive and the shuttering of rural and smaller hospitals/urgent care facilities.

Not a good presidential week, not a good man, and his attempts to divert attention appear to be the flailing of a desperate man. His poll numbers continue to tank. On my “Drowning Meter,” he is at “Glug.” It takes “Glug, Glug, Glug” to sink to the bottom.

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) said he would introduce a bill to send rebate checks to working Americans after President Donald Trump floated the idea on Friday.

Trump said the excess tariff revenue could be used to deliver a rebate to the Americans, but also said he still wanted to pay down the government's debt.

“I will introduce legislation in the Senate to send a rebate check to every working person in America,” Hawley said in a post on X, reacting to Trump's idea.

The Missouri senator told the Washington Examiner: “Working people deserve to get some tax relief here. And this is a terrific way to deliver it to them. It's an opportunity to put cash right back in the hands of working Americans.”

Hawley's office also told the Washington Examiner that he will model the legislation “after the stimulus checks proposal he worked on with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) during COVID.” The pair, both populists, came together to support a second round of $1,200 stimulus checks in 2020.

Trump responded to a reporter's question about the rebates earlier Friday, saying, “We are thinking about a rebate because we have so much money coming in from tariffs that a little rebate for people of a certain income level might be very nice.”

The president issued sweeping tariffs earlier this year that he has dialed back at various points, corresponding to either market panic or whether he makes trade deals with certain countries. The tariffs will generate revenue, but experts warned they could raise consumer prices.

Hawley's bill has yet to be introduced. It's unclear when the legislation will be introduced or what the details of the rebate check-in will be. The president did not specify how much the rebate would be, just that it would be given to people of “certain income” levels.

TRUMP FLOATS HANDING OUT REBATE CHECKS FROM TARIFF REVENUE

Any nationwide rebate would have to be approved by Congress. Hawley could team with a senator like Sanders to introduce the bill to increase its chances of passing.

Republicans control the House and Senate, making it likely such a rebate bill could pass if it hits the floor for a vote.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

American listeners don't want to party; they just want a break.

Can this really be the song of the summer? For seven weeks now, the most popular tune in the country has been Alex Warren's “Ordinary”—a solemn ballad that has all of the warm-weather appropriateness of a fur coat. Ideally, the song of the summer is a buoyant one, giving you a beat to bob a flamingo floatie to. “Ordinary,” instead, is made for stomping, moping, and forgetting.

The top reaches of the Billboard Hot 100 have otherwise mostly been stale and flukey, filled with songs that were popular last summer (Teddy Swims's “Lose Control”), replacement-level efforts by the streaming behemoths Drake and Morgan Wallen, and tie-ins from the Netflix cartoon show KPop Demon Hunters. Then, just last week, a welcome bit of warmth and novelty emerged at No. 2—“Daisies” by Justin Bieber, the unlikely emblem of our obviously fragile national mood.

Perhaps you aren't inclined to check out new music by a formerly chirpy child star who lately has been best known for his surreal interactions with paparazzi. But earlier this month, the 31-year-old Bieber suddenly released a new album, Swag, that made headlines for being rather good. Not “good for Bieber”; good for a modern pop release. Swag filled a void in the summer-listening landscape by meeting listeners where they so clearly seem to be—less in need of a party-fueling energy drink than a soothing slather of aloe.

The album is Bieber's first since parting ways with manager Scooter Braun, the record-business kingpin who recently seemed to suffer a catastrophic collapse in support from the celebrity class. The music departs from the pert poppiness of Bieber's past to indulge the singer's well-documented fascination with hip-hop and R&B. In one interlude, the comedian Druski tells Bieber “your soul is Black”; the assertion is cringey, but the album's music is significantly more subtle than that. Bieber never really raps. Rather, he uses his ever-yearning, creamy-soft voice to do what great rappers and R&B singers often do: find a pocket within a beat, and then let emotions be his guide.

What's really fascinating about the album, though, is that it sounds like it's wrapped in gauze. The production is aqueous and rippling, rather than shiny and laminated as one might expect from Bieber. Swag is heavily influenced by the indie producer-artists Dijon (who collaborated on a few of the album's songs) and Mk.gee (a producer on “Daisies”). They have risen to prominence by swirling bygone rock and pop signifiers into a comforting yet complex stew of sound. Swag's songs similarly hit the listener with a sense of gentle intrigue, like a minor recovered memory.

The instant hit “Daisies” exemplifies the approach. Its twanging guitars and pounding drums scan as countrified classic rock, but every element seems muffled, as if emanating from an iPhone lost in a couch. The verses steadily build energy and excitement—but then disperse in a gentle puff of feeling. In a lullaby whisper, Bieber sings of pining for his girl and sticking with her through good times and bad. “Hold on, hold on,” goes one refrain: a statement of desire for safety and stability, not passion and heat.

But my personal song-of-the-summer nomination would be Swag's opening track, “All I Can Take.” It opens in a tenor of pure cheese, with keyboard tones that were last fashionable when Steve Winwood and Boyz II Men were soundtracking school dances. A lightly pumping beat comes to the fore, setting the stage for a parade of different-sounding Biebers to perform. In one moment, he's a panting Michael Jackson impersonator. In another, he's an electronically distorted hyperpop sprite. The song is serene, and pretty, and ever so sad—yet it's also wiggling with details that suggest there's more to the story than initially meets the ear. The lyrics thread together sex talk with hints of stresses that must be escaped; “It's all I can take in this moment,” Bieber sings, hinting at a burnout whose cause the listener is left to imagine.

Swag's approach—downtempo yet bustling, melancholic yet awake—is on trend emotionally as much as it is musically. Though the year has brought no shortage of bright, upbeat pop albums from the likes of Lady Gaga and Kesha, the music that's sticking around has a reserved, simmering quality. The biggest Wallen song of the moment is “What I Want,” a collaboration with the whisper-singing diva Tate McRae; it builds suspense for a full minute before any percussion enters. One rising hit, Ravyn Lenae's “Love Me Not,” has a neo-soul arrangement that fidgets enough to keep the ear occupied without demanding active attention.

A dreary technological reason probably explains why this kind of music is popular: Streaming rewards background fare more than it rewards jolting dynamism. But even looking at my own recent playlists, downtempo seems in. The best song by Addison Rae, the TikTok phenom turned pop mastermind, is “Headphones On,” a chill-out track laden with tolling bells and jazz keyboards. I have kept returning to the album Choke Enough by Oklou, a French singer who makes electronic pop that's so skeletal and frail-seeming, you worry you're despoiling the songs merely by listening to them. Other recent highlights: the mumbled and dreamy indie rock of Alex G's Headlights, the depressive easy listening of Haim's I quit, and “Shapeshifter,” the wintry-sounding standout from Lorde's Virgin.

It's hard to avoid psychoanalyzing this season's musical offerings and concluding that the culture is suffering from malaise, or at least a hangover. After all, just a year ago we had “Brat summer,” named for the hedonistic Charli XCX album. The songs of that summer were irrepressible: Sabrina Carpenter's sarcastic “Espresso,” Kendrick Lamar's taunting “Not Like Us,” and Shaboozey's thumping “A Bar Song (Tipsy).” But this year, Charli XCX's biggest song is “Party 4 U”—a pandemic-doldrums ballad released in 2020 that recently blew up thanks to a TikTok trend of people sharing emo stories about their lives. The track captures a bleary feeling of trying to have fun but getting pulled into melancholy.

That's a feeling lots of Americans surely can relate to. Every era brings its own reasons to fret about the state of the world, but the headline-news topics of late—wars, deportations, layoffs—are upending lives in profound ways at mass scale. Swag isn't about any of that, but great pop always works to make small and personal emotions echo broad, communal ones.

Bieber's highly publicized experiences navigating mental health, drug use, and physical maladies have long served up a cautionary tale about life in the internet era. In the months leading up to Swag's release, he posted angry, inscrutable messages online and confronted reporters on the streets. Pundits have taken to asking Is he okay? The cooling, noncommittal, lightly distressed sound of Swag is an answer of sorts. Like many of us, he's doing as well as can be, given the circumstances.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

How a once-fringe conspiracy theory became a spiraling controversy

Lingering questions over the Epstein case are consuming the White House and paralyzing Congress. Panelists on Washington Week With The Atlantic joined to discuss how a once-fringe conspiracy theory became a spiraling controversy.

One of the reasons Donald Trump cannot manage to deny or deflect attention over the Epstein investigation is that the case centers on “what the MAGA base is about, which is powerful people doing things behind closed doors,” Eugene Daniels, a senior Washington correspondent at MSNBC, argued last night.

The president tends to talk to his base about “how the lowly man and woman are losing out to these interests in Washington,” Daniels continued. “But now they are seeing Donald Trump seemingly being one of the people doing the defending and the protecting of the powerful people,” and “that's why I think he can't shake it.”

Extreme weather is keeping more people stuck inside.

Americans have a long history of enduring heat waves by going outside. In a 1998 essay for The New Yorker, the author Arthur Miller described urbanites' Depression-era coping mechanisms: People caught the breeze on open-air trolleys, climbed onto the back of ice trucks, and flocked to the beach. In the evenings, they slept in parks or dragged their mattresses onto fire escapes.

But since air conditioning went mainstream, in the 1960s, the easiest way to beat the heat has been by staying indoors—at home, the office, the mall—where cool air is a constant and blinds are often drawn to prevent homes from overheating (and electric bills from skyrocketing). For this convenience, Americans sacrifice the benefits of sunshine and the opportunities for fun it creates. As climate change turns up the temperature, summers in America are coming down to a choice between enduring the heat and avoiding it—both of which might, in their own ways, be making people sick.

In cities across the country, summers are, on average, 2.6 degrees hotter than they were some 50 years ago. In Phoenix, where a 95-degree day is a relief, schedules are arranged around the darkness; Jeffrey Gibson, an accountant who works from home, takes his eight-month-old daughter out for walks before 6:30 a.m.; after that, it's so hot that she flushes bright red if they venture outside. He spends the rest of his day indoors unless leaving is absolutely necessary. It's like this from April to October. Gibson recently told his wife, “Man, I think I'm a little depressed.”

Josef A. Von Isser, a therapist in Tucson, Arizona, told me that feeling low in the summer comes up a lot with his clients. Some feel that the heat affects them directly; others struggle with its indirect effects, such as fewer opportunities to socialize and be somewhere other than home or the office. All of them, he suspects, might be experiencing seasonal affective disorder.

The DSM-5 categorizes SAD as a type of major depression with a seasonal pattern, with symptoms such as sadness, feelings of worthlessness, and low energy. Usually, it presents in the winter, though scientists don't agree on why. Some suspect that it's because a lack of sun exposure may contribute to decreased levels of serotonin, a hormone that regulates mood, as well as vitamin D, which helps stimulate serotonin activity. Another theory links low exposure to sunlight with unusually high levels of melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate sleep.

Read: The surprising truth about seasonal depression

Summer SAD is generally accepted as a variety of the disorder, but it's much rarer than the winter form; one study from earlier this year puts its prevalence at about 0.6 percent. That makes summer SAD especially hard to study. “It's clearly a different kind of illness,” Paul Desan, a psychiatry professor at Yale, told me, but “it's not in their imagination.” Unlike the winter form, which comes with a tendency to overeat, oversleep, and withdraw from society, summer SAD involves reduced appetite, insomnia, and restlessness—all of which can also be effects of heat. The scientific literature shows that heat is associated with mood disorders, anxiety, aggression, and reduced cognitive abilities. Uncomfortably hot nights, longer periods of daylight, and extended stretches of time spent indoors all disrupt sleep, which can in turn fuel mood disorders, Amruta Nori-Sarma, an environmental-health professor at Harvard, told me. Extreme heat can also be an obstacle to exercising, spending time in nature, and socializing, all of which can make people feel good and also double as important coping mechanisms for emotional distress.

Taking comfort in air conditioning when it's too hot out is a natural human response. But air-conditioned spaces can be stifling in their own way. Staying home where it's cool also means socializing less; some offices and homes hardly let in a wink of sunlight all day. It's plausible that in the summer, people experience SAD symptoms not only from excessive heat but also because they spend all of their time avoiding the sun, Kim Meidenbauer, a psychology professor at Washington State University, told me. “It does make sense to me that you'd have, potentially, an analogous pattern of effects” to winter SAD, she said. The link between indoor time and summer SAD hasn't been studied, but plenty of Americans, even if they don't meet the DSM-5 criteria, are noticing that summer is starting to feel a lot like winter. Reddit abounds with users who lament that being forced indoors by the heat gives them “summer depression.”

America's summer quandary—suffer inside or out?—will become only more persistent as climate change intensifies. In the United States, heat waves have grown more frequent and intense every decade since the 1960s. During a single heat wave last month, people in 29 states were warned to stay inside to avoid dangerously high temperatures. All of the experts I spoke with expressed concerns about the impacts of escalating heat on mental health. “I am not optimistic,” Ayman Fanous, a psychiatry professor at the University of Arizona, told me, noting that heat also has a well-established link with suicide risk and can exacerbate mental-health conditions such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and substance abuse. Many Americans don't have access to air conditioning, or they work jobs that require them to be outside in the heat. Those who can stay cool inside may avoid the most severe consequences but still end up miserable for half of the year.

As long as summer SAD remains poorly understood, the options for addressing it will be limited. Treatment for winter SAD usually involves exposure to light boxes that mimic sunlight, but these aren't recommended for summer SAD, because it might have a different neurobiological basis, Fanous said. For now, the first-line treatments are SSRIs such as Prozac—which can make people even more sensitive to heat.

For those with the means, the best strategy for beating summer SAD might be to move somewhere cooler. After eight years in Phoenix, Gibson has had enough of hiding from the heat for six months at a time and is ready to leave behind what he believes is his own summer SAD. Later this year, he plans to move his family to Colorado, where he hopes to be able to bring his daughter out during daylight hours. Yet Colorado summers, too, are becoming uncomfortably hot—and the same goes around the country. Last month, Alaska issued its first-ever heat advisory. As summer temperatures continue to rise, perhaps Americans will start to look back with envy on the ways our forebears beat the heat. The hotter summer nights get, the more sleeping on the fire escape starts to sound like a luxury.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Yulia Svyrydenko has heard the same sexist critiques as nearly all of Eastern Europe's female leaders.

This month, the Ukrainian government made an unusual choice for its new prime minister. In a rare move for the country—and indeed for most of Eastern Europe—it picked a woman. Yulia Svyrydenko, a 39-year-old selected by President Volodymyr Zelensky and approved by Parliament, will lead the government in a period of intense uncertainty, as Russia escalates its offensive, Europe revamps its security commitments, and the Trump administration waffles on the war.

Some Ukrainian and Western observers have suggested that Svyrydenko isn't up to the task, in part because they characterize her as a mere “loyalist” to Zelensky. She “would do everything saluting, without fail,” an anonymous source in Zelensky's party told New Voice, a Ukrainian magazine. “I don't believe she can reform our country,” Oleksiy Goncharenko, a member of Parliament, told me as he left a legislative session last week where he'd voted against her candidacy. “If she tries to criticize the president, she will end up like General Zaluzhny,” he continued, referring to Ukraine's former army chief, whom Zelensky had dismissed after their differences became public.

The new prime minister is also facing overtly sexist criticism. “Svyrydenko is exactly the girl who all of you, dear students, are familiar with from school: She always sits at the front desk” and “carefully writes down the teacher's notes,” Oleh Posternak, a Ukrainian political strategist, wrote in a Facebook post that a national media site republished.

Very few women have led former Soviet states, and they have virtually all received this kind of disparagement from men. In 2018, Georgia elected its first female president, Salome Zourabichvili, who'd run as an independent. Before she even took office, political observers called her a “finger puppet” of the billionaire leader of the ruling party, which had endorsed her. Today, many in Georgia credit Zourabichvili with uniting the opposition, and she condemned as “totally falsified” a recent election won by the party of her former patron.

In Moldova, many discounted Maia Sandu, who became the country's first female president in 2020. Sandu's rival in the race, the pro-Russian incumbent, Igor Dodon, criticized her for not having children—a line of attack that MAGA would later take up against Kamala Harris in the 2024 U.S. presidential race. In Dodon's view, Sandu's lack of offspring meant that she was “not interested in what is happening in the country.” Her opponents launched a misinformation campaign about her, much of which centered on the coronavirus pandemic. “The fake news scared people that I would close schools, hospitals, and even churches,” Sandu told me at the time. Instead, Sandu invested in the country's medical and educational sectors, recruited European Union support for her agenda, and oversaw funding for the restoration of Orthodox churches. She has also been an effective reformer, working to root out the country's extensive corruption.

Anne Applebaum: The country that suffers whenever Russia schemes

Svyrydenko has a chance to leave a similar legacy in Ukraine. She has ample experience working with foreign governments, whose support is now existentially important to Ukraine. Early in her career, she served as the country's only permanent representative in China, bringing investment to her hometown of Chernihiv. As deputy prime minister, Svyrydenko negotiated billion-dollar reconstruction projects and trade agreements with the European Commission and Emirati leaders, as well as a $400 million investment from Turkish business interests. She also helped broker a natural-resources agreement with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to create a joint investment fund to rebuild Ukraine.

Her appointment last week was part of a larger government reshuffle by Zelensky, who reassigned the previous prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, to the role of defense minister. In her new role, Svyrydenko will be tasked with rehabilitating the economy, boosting the domestic production of weapons, and strengthening Ukraine's armed forces, in part by securing financing from allies and the International Monetary Fund. One of her first actions as prime minister was to advance talks with the United States about a major potential investment in Ukraine's drone industry.

Nevertheless, and despite her strong résumé, Svyrydenko will have to contend with broad reservations in Ukraine about female leadership. According to a 2020 study conducted by the research group Rating, Ukrainians are more likely to prefer male political executives. Sometimes bad actors take advantage of this trust gap. Katerina Sergatskova, the executive director of the 2402 Foundation, which supports and trains Ukrainian journalists, has seen many Ukrainian women in public life become the target of harassment. “It is political sexism. The attacks are well-organized campaigns,” Sergatskova told me. She has experienced such a campaign herself, which included death threats that forced her to stay out of Ukraine for a time.

Sergatskova noted that many in Ukraine are comparing Svyrydenko to the country's first female prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, who took office in 2005 and faced several corruption charges. One case resulted in a criminal conviction against her and two and a half years in prison, which the U.S. condemned as politically motivated. After the 2014 revolution, which ousted Ukraine's pro-Russian regime, the supreme court overruled Tymoshenko's conviction and ordered her release. Nevertheless, a large majority of the Ukrainian public still don't trust her.

Zelensky has fought against Ukraine's abiding suspicion of female politicians by promoting a new generation of them into leadership positions. In addition to picking Svyrydenko as prime minister, he also announced the appointment of Olha Stefanishyna as Ukraine's new special representative to the United States. The approach sets him apart from Vladimir Putin. Valentina Matviyenko, one of two women who serve on the Russian president's permanent security council, put on a Barbie-pink suit last year and derided feminism as “an anti-male, anti-traditional-values movement.” Meanwhile, Russia bans and prosecutes feminist groups, and Putin tells Russian women to have “minimum two children.”

For those who fear that Svyrydenko will be no more than a Zelensky loyalist, she is already facing her first test. This week, Zelensky tightened the administration's control over two independent agencies tasked with fighting government corruption. Sevgil Musayeva, the editor in chief of the newspaper Ukrainska Pravda, described the move as a step toward authoritarianism. “Svyrydenko has a chance to act now and speak against this decision that is undermining democracy, which our soldiers are dying for,” Musayeva told me. “But such action would require a lot of her courage.”

Two days after Zelensky reined in the government watchdogs, Svyrydenko met with G7 ambassadors in Kyiv to discuss anti-corruption policy—a subtle acknowledgment, perhaps, that the president had gone too far. But not everyone is convinced that Svyrydenko will be able to stand up to Zelensky. “Officially, we are a parliamentary-presidential republic,” Goncharenko, the legislator, told me last week. “I wish that were true. But we live in wartime; the decisions are made by the president.” Goncharenko isn't holding out hope that Svyrdrydenko will be able to make her own choices: “If she contradicts his policy, he will simply fire her.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Taking a book outside can be a practice in holding your attention.

This is an edition of The Wonder Reader, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a set of stories to spark your curiosity and fill you with delight. Sign up here to get it every Saturday morning.

“Reading has been unfairly maligned as an indoor activity for far too long,” Bekah Waalkes wrote this past spring. “As a child, when nice weather came around, I was told to put down my book and go play outside.” But why can't reading a book be a form of outdoor play? Reading outside can also be a practice in sustained attention, Waalkes writes: The act of focus can actually sharpen “one's perception of the trees, the soil, the friends chattering at the next table in the beer garden.”

Today's newsletter offers a guide to reading outdoors—how to make the most of it, and which books to take with you on your adventure.

Wesleyan President Michael Roth details the conservative agenda targeting American universities.

Project 2025 laid out the battle plan pretty clearly: Get rid of the Department of Education, shut off federal funding, take control of the accreditation system, and take down diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. And, in the end, change what students are encouraged to study and what professors are allowed to teach.

So why is this happening? And is it working?

Michael Roth is the president of Wesleyan University and the author of several books about college, including Beyond the University and The Student: A Short History. He's also one of higher education's most vocal defenders, and one of the few prominent university presidents willing to take a moral and political stand against authoritarian overreach from the government, which he sees as an attack not just on colleges and universities, but on civil society itself.

I invited Roth onto The Gray Area to talk about the political backlash against universities and why it matters. We also discuss where American universities have gone wrong, what needs to change, and what he thinks college is actually for in the world of AI. As always, there's much more in the full podcast, so listen and follow The Gray Area on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pandora, or wherever you find podcasts. New episodes drop every Monday.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

You said recently that the federal government is “trying to destroy civil society by undermining the legitimacy of colleges and universities.” That's a pretty dramatic statement. What do you mean?

I think it's extraordinarily clear that the Trump administration is hell-bent on destroying civil society — that arena of our culture and our polity that has sources of legitimacy independent of the ideology of the person in the White House. You see that in the attack on law firms. You see it in the attack on the press.

The war on universities is similar. They're not really going after universities that have egregious issues of civil rights violations. They're going after the high-profile, high-legitimacy institutions like Harvard, like UVA, like the other Ivy League schools, with the exception of Dartmouth. They're doing that because these schools have a claim on our allegiance or our respect that is not founded in the ideology of those currently in the White House.

When you say “destroying,” what do you mean? What is the administration actually doing?

Well, they start with easy things, right? Trans women athletes. There are fewer than 10 trans athletes in the country in NCAA varsity sports. That's a winning issue for a variety of reasons. The White House is going to determine who plays volleyball, and then they're going to determine how to teach Mideast or near Eastern Studies. They're going to say, If you don't teach near Eastern Studies the way we want you to with appropriate respect for Israel, then you're not going to get money for Alzheimer's research.

What happens is that everybody in higher education starts moving away from anything that might offend those in the White House. You have this slide from the university as fostering an oppositional culture, which it has in the United States for a long time, at least since the Second World War, towards the universities as institutions in which people with money, power, diplomas, and legitimacy start trying to anticipate what they should say to not annoy — or even to please — the president and his friends.

I don't think President Trump really cares about Alzheimer's research at Harvard, but he wants to make sure that people at Harvard — and then everyone who doesn't have the resources that Harvard has to fight — line up. I think that's why you don't see a lot of opposition from colleges, universities right now because everyone has already started lining up.

As you know, a lot of people shrug their shoulders at all of this. They think, What's the big deal? These campuses are full of privileged people with predictably extreme views, views that aren't representative of most of the country, so who cares? To that sort of reaction, what do you say?

Well, it's been an orchestrated reaction. I think that at UVA, the fastest-growing major is computer science and the fastest-growing minor is data science. Hardly the stuff of “woke” lunatics. At Harvard, the most popular majors are the ones that lead to Wall Street. Again, this notion that Harvard or UVA is filled with people with extreme views who are unrepresentative of America — they're unrepresentative of America because they're really smart.

“Yes, universities have real problems, but I don't think that those problems are what has led to the assault on…the ability of schools to educate students the way they see fit.”

It's unfortunate because in a democracy, you can be really proud of people who excel, even though they do things we can't do. When I watch, I don't know, Patrick Mahomes, play quarterback and escape a crazy rush, I'm filled with admiration. Or the elite fighters in the Navy SEALs or the Army Rangers — we don't think of them as elitist, we just think of them as exceptional. But at some of these schools, we resent them for having created an environment where people like those guys can thrive and the rest of us don't have access to it.

In a healthy democracy, you allow people to experiment with ideas, art, science, and politics, it's never totally open-ended. Of course, there are always some guardrails. What we're seeing now is a concerted effort to bring those guardrails in so that people have to resemble those in power. That is unusual in the history of the United States.

You used the word “orchestrated.” Do you think this is completely manufactured? Even if some of this backlash is cynical and engineered, and no doubt a lot of it is, how much have universities contributed to it through leadership failures or bad policies?

Yeah, it's a fair question. Yes, universities have real problems, but I don't think that those problems are what has led to the assault on free speech, on freedom of association, and on the ability of schools to educate students the way they see fit.

The problems of universities are political problems and we haven't done a good job in solving them. Let me just mention two quick things. One problem is the ideological conformity or the ideological narrowness of faculty in most colleges and universities, especially at those like mine and the highly selective schools in the Northeast. All over the country, university faculty are mostly people left-of-center, and that has gotten much worse over time.

I think it's about prejudice on the part of the faculty, not only prejudice, but that faculty members hire folks with whom they're comfortable. They hire people whose political views they're more comfortable with. I think that's a problem that should be fixed by the faculty itself. They should be aware of their prejudices and counteract them as best they can. I think that's a significant problem.

The broader cultural problem is that American higher education has defined its quality on the basis of the number of people that are excluded from it. We prize being highly selective. I used that phrase myself a few moments ago.

What does that mean? We reject most people who want to go there. That's a very American thing. It's not only American, but you want the thing you can't get access to. That's a traditional capitalist bourgeois fact that lots of people want the thing that they have trouble getting access to. Colleges and universities have cultivated condescension rather than democratic practices.

I think the basic problem that elite colleges in particular have right now is that people outside of these institutions increasingly think they are places where ideology has been confused with inquiry, where education has been confused with activism. Is this a problem for you? Or is this just what free speech ought to look like?

Well, I think it is both of those things. It is a problem when schools define activism or civic engagement in an ideologically restricted way. I think it's an intellectual problem. I think it's a moral problem for schools. I'll give you an example. I gave a talk at a conference and a guidance counselor from a high school said, “If one of my students was applying to Wesleyan and she said her engagement was protecting the rights of the unborn, it would be professional malpractice for me to allow her to put that in the application.”

Now, I guess I was naive. I was shocked by that. That was to me a slap in the head that I needed because I have no reason to doubt that he was right. I think that's the way in which the soft despotism of prejudice constricts free speech. I've been fighting against it now for the last decade or so, both as a person who has access to the media and writes articles about such things, but also as a teacher, adding more conservative voices into my own classes. I've always privileged the kind of mavericks and philosophy or political theory, but now I'm also adding to my classes criticisms of those voices or those progressive thinkers.

Students are totally capable of dealing with the issues. They may not on their own gravitate towards conservative critiques of progressivism, but once exposed to them, they're perfectly happy and willing, able to deal with a variety of perspectives. All of that is to say that a school can define a civic purpose, I think, that's not in tension with its educational purposes. Most schools in the United States ever since the 1700s have had a civic purpose as part of what they do.

I think it's nonsense that some college presidents are saying, “Oh, we're just for the pursuit of truth.” Colleges in America have always been about character and civics. We can embrace that, but we can't do it in a parochial way. If we do it in a parochial way, we're limiting the educational potential of our students to explore ideas that may not be currently fashionable in their generation or among the faculty.

Let's zoom out from this a little bit because there's a more fundamental question that we've wrestled with on this show, which is: What is college actually for? Is it just job preparation, a credentialing machine, or is it more?

I believe that college is for three things. The first is to discover what you love to do — what makes you feel alive when you're working. It's important for students to have the freedom to make that discovery because at a selective school, they say, Well, I got As in this subject, but they may not like doing that, or they've never tried engineering, astronomy, poetry. A place where they can discover the kinds of things that give them meaning when they do those things.

The second thing is to make the person who's discovering what they love to do get much better at what they love to do. We can do a better job of that. Grade inflation drives me nuts, makes me feel like the old man that I am. I think we need to kick the student in the butt because a lot of the time they think they're pretty good at something and maybe they're pretty good, but they can get a lot better. I think it's really important that every student works really hard. It's so against the grain of the American consumer view of higher education, which is that it should be this time in your life where you get to have so much fun. You make your friends, you get married, have a lot of sex, and that's fine. That's discovering what you love to do in a way, but I think students should go to a school where there are people who are making you better at what you love to do.

The third thing is that you learn how to share what you've gotten better at and you love to do with other people. That usually means selling it. It means getting a job where you can continue to practice the things you love to do and that people will pay you for doing it.

People will say to me, Well, I discovered I love poetry, so I sit in the basement and write poems. No, no, no. I mean, you've got to get better at it and then you've got to be able to take it out into the marketplace, out into the world. If you have those three things — discovering what you love to do, getting much better at it, and learning to take it out into the world and finding a job where these things are aligned — that is a way that college can help people thrive long after they graduate.

Are you worried that AI is a threat to the model of education you just described? 

It can be a tool for the model I just described. I mean, I use AI all the time when I'm trying to find out information about things or get various takes on an issue. I think it's really helpful. I do worry that the joy that I've tried to describe of thinking for yourself in the company of others or discovering what you love to do and getting better at it — that you might not have that experience because you can outsource it to a bot.

Now, take athletes as a counterexample. If I say to somebody on the football team, Instead of hitting that guy or running laps, why don't you just play Madden or something. Have a very good AI version of football, put your immersive thing on and you don't have to play. I think they'll look at me like I'm crazy because it's an embodied practice.

It's not just watching football. Now, I think that the hard question that you're pointing to is, Do people want to think, or will they be happy if AI thinks for them? I believe they want to think if you invite them to think.

The Jeffrey Epstein story has swallowed the country whole.

Over the past couple of weeks, one story has overshadowed every other, no matter how important they might be: Jeffrey Epstein.

Unless you've been taking your summer vacation on Mars, you probably know the contours of the story. (And if you don't, my Vox colleague Andrew Prokop wrote a useful summary this week.) But what matters here isn't so much the details as it is the sheer, unrelenting attention it has commanded.

A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world.

Between July 6, before the story really began to blow up, and July 13, online searches on the topic increased by 1,900 percent, according to a Newsweek analysis. A CNN analyst noted that over roughly the same time scale, Epstein was Googled 2.5 times more than Grok — this during the AI model's, uh, newsworthy launch — and 1.4 times more than tariffs.

The furor over the case has led to Congress essentially shutting down early for the summer, a Republican effort to evade Democrats' sudden and politically convenient demands for transparency. It's not too much to say that the business of America has all but halted because of a years-old criminal case.

I'm not saying the Epstein case is totally without importance. The crime was horrific, the investigation details murky, and the political ramifications if the case shakes the president's connection to his political base are obviously meaningful. (And if you want to read about any of that, well, good news — you have no shortage of sources.) But there is virtually no way we'll look back in 20 years and think that the relitigation of the Epstein case was clearly the most important thing happening in the world in July 2025.

Attention is a finite resource, and you are where your attention is. A story like Epstein is analogous to a mindless, out-of-control fire consuming all the oxygen in a burning house. So I thought I'd put together a list of four stories happening right now that matter far more for the country and the world than the contents of the Epstein Files. And fair warning — they're not all good news stories, but they absolutely are worth your attention.

Through the first nine months of the 2025 fiscal year, which goes up to this June, the United States spent $749 billion on interest on the national debt, more than it spent on anything other than Social Security. Not the debt itself — just the interest. And our debt problem is accelerating: According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), President Donald Trump's recently passed budget bill will add $3.4 trillion to the national balance sheet over the next decade.

You might say: So what? Budget scolds have been warning about the debt since at least the 1980s, and the most dire predictions have yet to come true. But as the economist Herbert Simon once warned, referring specifically to unsustainable economic policies: “If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.” While “there's no magic number at which the debt load becomes a full-on crisis,” as my colleague Dylan Matthews wrote last year, just about everything that is happening now — including persistently high interest rates, which make debt that much more painful, as anyone with a recent mortgage knows — indicates that crisis point is on its way.

And what will happen then? The CBO warns that unless budget patterns shift dramatically, the country will face an unpalatable mix of massive tax hikes, severe cuts to essential services, even default. And our debt problem intersects catastrophically with some of America's other generational challenges, like the fertility and aging crisis (see No. 3) and the country's ability to defend itself (No. 4).

I've written before about the long-term improvements in child mortality and extreme poverty. Those trends are real, and they represent some of the best reasons to feel optimistic about the world.

But positive long-term trends can mask periods of setback. When it comes to childhood hunger, the world is in danger of falling back. A new UNICEF report shows that after more than two decades of consistent progress, child stunting — early-life malnutrition that can lead to less growth and lifelong health problems — appears to be rising again. And while the humanitarian catastrophe that is Gaza at least has the world's attention, if not enough of its help, hunger is spreading in other countries that remain under the radar.

In Africa's largest country of Nigeria, nearly 31 million people face acute food insecurity — almost equivalent to the population of Texas. Ethiopia, Pakistan, and Yemen have all seen alarming reversals in childhood nutritional health. Add in surges in food prices driven by extreme weather, and the devastating effects of cuts in US food aid, and you have a recipe for a problem that is getting worse at the very moment when the willingness to help is eroding.

When it comes to long-term, world-changing trends, climate change gets most of the attention (if not necessarily the action). But there's another challenge unfolding in nearly every country in the world that will be just as transformative — and for which we may be even less prepared.

That's the population slowdown. In 2024, the US fertility rate hit an all-time low of less than 1.6 births per woman, far below the 2.1 required to maintain the current population level. While other countries like Japan or Italy will get there sooner, the US is absolutely on a path to an aging, shrinking future. As early as 2033, annual deaths are predicted to outpace annual births, while by 2050, one in every five Americans will be over the age of 65.

Given that a generation ago, we were worrying about global overpopulation, many people seem to think a smaller population would largely be a good thing. Certainly that's what my emails suggest every time I write about the issue. Well, let me tell you this: It will not. (Even for climate change, apparently.)

An aging and eventually shrinking population will put more stress on everything from health care to pension systems to economic productivity, in ways that — absent some kind of technological miracle — will make us poorer, and will change life in ways we can only begin to imagine. And no one really has any idea how to fix it, or if it's even fixable at all.

The Cold War ended nearly 35 years ago. For all of that time, the US has enjoyed a historically unprecedented position of global military supremacy. Americans have lived with the background assumption that the US would never really face a war with a true geopolitical rival — and certainly wouldn't lose one. Of all our national privileges, that might be the most foundational one. But that foundation is in danger of crumbling.

Geopolitical tensions — especially with China — are escalating, yet America's military readiness is quietly degrading. The US Navy's current annual budget is over a quarter-trillion dollars, but the service still maintains about the same number of ships as in 2003. While the US builds about five commercial ships a year, China builds more than 1,000, and its naval fleet is already larger.

At the same time, America's munitions reserves are dangerously low. In supporting Israel during its recent conflict with Iran, nearly 14 percent of the US's vital THAAD missile interceptor inventory was expended — just replenishing those stores may take up to eight years. Meanwhile, Pentagon authorities temporarily paused shipments of Patriot missiles and other critical air-defense systems to Ukraine amid global stockpile pressures. US air defenses now reportedly have only a quarter of the interceptors needed for all the Pentagon's military plans. Should a major conflict pop up in, oh I don't know, Taiwan, essential munitions could be depleted far faster than production could replace them. That's how you lose wars.

None of these stories are scandals, and none of them generate great social media content. They're hard, long-term, wonky, even boring. But they are important. And they deserve our attention.

Meta just escalated the AI talent war with OpenAI.

Shengjia Zhao, a co-creator of ChatGPT and former lead scientist at OpenAI, is joining Meta as chief scientist of its Superintelligence Labs.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Zhao's appointment on Friday in a social media post, and called him a ""pioneer"" in the field who has already driven several major AI breakthroughs.

Zhao previously helped build GPT-4 and led synthetic data efforts at OpenAI. According to the post, Zhao will now work directly with Zuckerberg and Meta's newly appointed chief AI officer, Alexandr Wang, the founder and CEO of Scale AI.

The new hire comes during Zuckerberg's multibillion-dollar AI spending spree, including a $15 billion investment in Scale AI and the creation of Meta Superintelligence Labs, a new division focused on foundational models and next-gen research.

In addition to Zhao, the company has lured away the three researchers who built OpenAI's Zurich office — Lucas Beyer, Alexander Kolesnikov, and Xiaohua Zhai — all of whom previously also worked at Google's DeepMind. The Superintelligence Labs team is now comprised of a lineup of names previously seen with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.

But the war for AI talent is far from over.

Databricks VP Naveen Rao likened the competition to ""looking for LeBron James,"" estimating that fewer than 1,000 people worldwide can build frontier AI models.

Companies without the cash for massive pay packages are turning to hackathons and computing power as incentives. Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas said a Meta researcher he tried to poach told him to ask again when the company has ""10,000 H100s.""

AI tech workers have previously told Business Insider that Meta's Mark Zuckerberg has been emailing prospects directly and even hosting AI researchers at his home, while OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has made personal calls to potential hires.

Tech company executives have mixed feelings about Meta's poaching efforts.

""Meta right now are not at the frontier, maybe they'll they'll manage to get back on there,"" said Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind, on an episode of the ""Lex Fridman Podcast,"" which aired on Friday.

""It's probably rational what they're doing from their perspective because they're behind and they need to do something,"" Hassabis added.

During a July 18 episode of the podcast ""Uncapped with Jack Altman,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman criticised some of Meta's ""giant offers"" to his company's employees, and called the strategy ""crazy.""

""The degree to which they're focusing on money and not the work and not the mission,"" said Sam Altman. ""I don't think that's going to set up a great culture.""

Meta and OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comments.

The more the merrier at Meta.

The AI talent wars took another turn on Friday when Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Shengjia Zhao, co-creator of ChatGPT and the former lead scientist at OpenAI, is now the chief scientist at Meta's Superintelligence Labs.

""In this role, Shengjia will set the research agenda and scientific direction for our new lab working directly with me and Alex,"" a statement shared to Zuckerberg's Threads account said. ""Shengjia co-founded the new lab and has been our lead scientist from day one.""

The statement said Meta chose to formalize Zhao's leadership position because recruiting is ""going well"" and the team ""is coming together.""

While the announcement elicited congratulatory remarks from some AI enthusiasts online, and more discussion about Meta's ongoing poaching spree, others asked: What about Yann LeCun?

LeCun became a prominent figure in the AI industry after joining Meta, then Facebook, in 2013. He serves as the chief AI scientist for Meta's Fundamental AI Research, formerly known as Facebook AI Research. On LinkedIn, LeCun acknowledged the questions and clarified his role at Meta.

""My role as Chief Scientist for FAIR has always been focused on long-term AI research and building the next AI paradigms,"" LeCun wrote on Friday. ""My role and FAIR's mission are unchanged.""

Zuckerberg and Alexandr Wang, the Scale AI founder who joined Meta in June as its chief AI officer, confirmed that LeCun's role is unchanged on their respective social media accounts.

Although both FAIR and the Superintelligence Labs deal with AI, they're slightly different.

Meta created FAIR over a decade ago to research and advance AI technology, which resulted in the 2023 release of its open-source large language model, Llama. LeCun is now largely focused on developing a new kind of model, known as a world model, that could one day replace large language models.

The Superintelligence Labs, meanwhile, is the umbrella department housing Meta's FAIR, foundations, and products teams, Zuckerberg said in an internal memo in June. Zuckerberg said the Superintelligence Labs would focus on developing ""personal superintelligence for everyone."" Bloomberg reported that LeCun would report to Wang.

Wang praised Zhao in an X post on Friday.

""Shengjia is a brilliant scientist who most recently pioneered a new scaling paradigm in his research,"" Wang said in an X post on Friday. ""He will lead our scientific direction for our team.""

LeCun said he's looking forward to working with Zhao ""to accelerate the integration of new research into our most advanced models.""

ABOARD A NATO AWACS PLANE — As the aircraft soared over Eastern Europe, tiny triangles and U-shapes blinked across a glowing console. Each shape marked a presence — a ship, a fighter jet, or something else moving near the Baltic Sea and the militarized Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.

The NATO E-3A Sentry, a flying radar and airborne command post, was tracking them all, with its rotating radar dome scanning hundreds of miles in every direction.

""We're the eyes in the sky,"" said Maj. Ben, a US Air Force officer and the mission's fighter allocator. ""Being up at 30,000 feet, we can look down and we see pretty much everything to the ground.""

Business Insider was given access to a NATO AWACS flight this week for an eight-hour surveillance mission above Eastern Europe.

Departing from Geilenkirchen Air Base in western Germany — home to 14 aging E-3s — at 8 am, the plane flew east to support Baltic Sentry operations, an ongoing alliance effort focused on protecting undersea infrastructure after recent sabotage incidents in the Baltic Sea.

""Nice view, right?"" someone in the cockpit, it wasn't immediately clear who, said into their headset as the plane poked through the thin cloud layer.

The airborne warning and control system, or AWACS, is a modified Boeing 707/320 passenger plane with a long-range radar and advanced sensors that can detect friendly or hostile objects from far away and collect data that can be distributed in real time to allied ground stations, ships, or other aircraft.

The E-3 is easily recognizable with its 360-degree rotating radar dome above the fuselage. It can see over 300 miles across the air and surface, giving commanders critical situational awareness at war or in peacetime.

As an older plane, the interior feels more like a Cold War time capsule than a 21st-century warplane, but this aircraft is actually a surveillance nerve center loaded with advanced and highly classified equipment, keeping tabs on things.

The surveillance mission is ""the bread and butter of this platform,"" said Maj. Ben, who, like others BI spoke with during the flight, could only be identified by his rank and first name for security reasons.

The E-3 is capable of a range of missions, including surveillance, tracking, target detection, early warning, command and control, and battle management, making it a high-value military asset and one of the few that NATO itself actually owns.

NATO received its first E-3s in 1982. Despite their age, these planes have proven indispensable since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. After the full-scale assault in 2022, the AWACS fleet intensified its patrols to monitor Russian activity and deter aggression on NATO's eastern flank.

The AWACS functions like a high-flying office space, with a range of different roles and stations where crew members work at their computers or with other sensitive instruments. In the back of the aircraft are a few makeshift beds, a place to store and heat food, and a toilet. Looking at it in 2025, the interior is dated and almost feels like stepping into a museum.

This flying command station is anything but an artifact. The plane is packed with advanced capabilities. And just about everything the crew touches, from paperwork to computer screens, is classified and had to be sanitized before BI could take photos. The most sensitive area of the aircraft, where key communication systems are, is covered with a curtain.

The plane's big radar rotates once every 10 seconds and can detect everything from warships to aircraft to air defense systems. It gathers data that the surveillance operators can see on digital maps and immediately transmit to users on the ground, at sea, or in the air.

""Wherever the demand is for an air picture, we can go there,"" explained Cpt. Jasper, a Dutch surveillance controller who monitors the airspace and surface.

""That's something that static sites cannot do, and what most ground sites cannot do,"" he said, adding that this is the advantage of ""having a big flying radar and air control station.""

One screen BI was authorized to review showed activity in and above Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, the Baltic Sea, and Kaliningrad. The small but heavily militarized Russian province, sandwiched between two NATO countries, has long been a concern for the alliance. That is why the AWACS are watching, and they see everything.

If a Russian fighter jet took off from an airbase in Kaliningrad, the AWACS — circling just beyond its airspace — would surely spot it. The exclave hosts some of Moscow's ships, ground forces, and air defenses.

Cpt. Marek, a Polish passive controller who works with the AWACS' advanced sensors, said the aircraft provides extra ""situational awareness"" to the Baltic Sentry operation and for the eastern flank allies. He added that the aircraft is an essential part of European security, and that's especially been the case since the war in Ukraine started.

Beyond its robust surveillance capabilities, the E-3 is also a command and control platform that can coordinate with other aircraft and easily be retasked. This flight, for instance, was initially set to operate in Polish airspace but moved to Lithuanian airspace to support a training mission involving Portuguese F-16 fighter jets.

That flexibility is a critical capability for high-end fights, where numerous assets would be on the move in a fast-paced operating environment. ""For the time we are now in, it's better to have a flexible force. We can go everywhere,"" said Cpt. Jasper said.

Key to the E-3's flexibility is its endurance. The aircraft can normally operate for eight and a half hours, although it can fly longer missions through its air-to-air refueling capability. At one point during the flight, the vintage seatbelt sign clicked on, signaling that this process was about to begin.

Aerial refueling is a delicate process that requires the AWACS pilots to drop altitude and fly the aircraft by hand so it can connect to the tanker and receive fuel. This made for a bumpy stretch that much of the crew elected to sleep through.

From the cockpit, the E-3 closed with the American KC-135 tanker aircraft, getting so close that the face of an airman inside could be seen to take on 40,000 pounds of fuel before separating and going on with its mission.

Dutch Cpt. Donny Demmers, a public affairs officer who was permitted to share his full name, said NATO can send an AWACS to operate from an area far from base, and thanks to the mid-air refueling, the plane can remain on station for a long time.

The E-3 flew back to Geilenkirchen and touched down shortly before 4 pm, but that flight time could have been greatly extended if needed during a crisis.

""The flexibility gives us the survivability,"" Demmers said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Tesla investors are growing wary of Elon Musk's futuristic promises","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/26/tesla-investors-grow-wary-of-elon-musk-robotaxi-promises.html","Sat, 26 Jul 2025 12:00:01 GMT","



In this article

At Tesla, vehicle sales are slumping, profits are thinning and revenue from regulatory credit sales are poised to dry up due to Republican-led policy changes.

In the past, CEO Elon Musk's futuristic promises have convinced investors to look past top and bottom line numbers.

Not now.

Following another fairly dismal earnings report this week, Musk told analysts on the call that Tesla's electric vehicles will soon become driverless, making money for owners while they sleep. He also said Tesla's robotaxi service, which the company recently started testing in a limited capacity in Austin, Texas, will expand to other states, with a goal of being able to reach half the U.S. population by year-end, ""assuming we have regulatory approvals.""

It didn't matter.

Tesla shares plummeted 8% on Thursday as investors focused on the immediate challenges facing the company, including the rapid rise of lower-cost EV competitors, particularly in China, and a political backlash against Musk that harmed Tesla's brand in the U.S. and Europe.

Automotive sales declined 16% year-over-year in the second quarter for the EV maker, with weak sales numbers continuing in Europe and California. Musk said there could be a ""few rough quarters"" ahead because of the EV credits expiring and President Donald Trump's tariffs.

The stock bounced back some on Friday, gaining 3.5%, but still ended the week down and has now fallen 22% this year, the worst performance among tech's megacaps. The Nasdaq rose 1% for the week and is up more than 9% in 2025, closing at a record on Friday.

""Look, we love robotaxis. And robots,"" wrote analysts at Canaccord Genuity, who recommend buying Tesla's stock, in a note after the earnings report. ""Over time, Tesla is well positioned to benefit from these future-forward opportunities.""

The analysts, however, said that they're focused on the profit and loss statement, writing: ""But we love growth too, in the here and now. We need the P&L dynamics to turn.""

Analysts at Jefferies described the earnings update as ""a bit dull."" And Goldman Sachs said Tesla's robotaxi effort is ""still small"" with limited technical data points.

Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment.

Musk, who has previously called himself ""pathologically optimistic,"" has been able to sway shareholders and send the stock soaring at times with promises of self-driving cars, humanoid robots and more affordable EVs.

But after a decade of missed self-imposed deadlines on autonomous driving, Wall Street is watching Tesla fall behind Alphabet's Waymo in the U.S. and Baidu's Apollo Go in China.

In Tesla's shareholder deck, the company said the second quarter marked the start of its ""transition from leading the electric vehicle and renewable energy industries to also becoming a leader in AI, robotics and related services."" The company didn't offer any new guidance for growth or profits for the year ahead.

Business Insider reported on Friday that Tesla told staff its robotaxi service could launch in the San Francisco Bay Area as soon as this weekend.

But Tesla hasn't applied for permits that would be required to run a driverless ridehailing service in California, CNBC confirmed. The company would first need authorizations from the state's Department of Motor Vehicles and the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).

The CPUC told CNBC on Friday, that under existing permits, Tesla can only operate a human-driven chartered vehicle service, not carry passengers in robotaxis.

On the earnings call, Musk and other Tesla execs claimed the company was working on regulatory approvals to launch in Nevada, Arizona, Florida and other markets, in addition to San Francisco, but offered no details about what would be required.

Within Austin, the company said its robotaxi service had driven 7,000 miles, and that Tesla has been restricting its robotaxis' to roads with a speed limit of 40 miles per hour. The Austin service involves a small fleet of about 10 to 20 Model Y vehicles equipped with the company's latest self-driving systems.

The Tesla robotaxis rely on remote supervision by employees in a customer service center, and a human safety supervisor in the front passenger seat, ready to intervene if needed.

Compare that to what Alphabet said on its second-quarter earnings call the same day as Tesla's results.

""The Waymo Driver has now autonomously driven over 100 million miles on public roads, and the team is testing across more than 10 cities this year, including New York and Philadelphia,"" Alphabet said. Meanwhile, Waymo has become significant enough that Alphabet added a category to its Other Bets revenue description in its latest quarterly filing.

""Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of autonomous transportation services, healthcare-related services and internet services,"" the filing said. The Other Bets segment remains relatively small, with revenue coming in at $373 million in the quarter. 

Regardless of investor skepticism, Musk is more bullish than ever.

On Friday, the world's richest person posted on his social network X that he thinks Tesla will someday be worth $20 trillion. On the earnings call earlier in the week, he said that when it comes to AI for cars and robots, ""Tesla is actually much better than Google by far"" and ""much better than anyone at real world AI.""

CORRECTION: The Waymo Driver has now autonomously driven over 100 million miles on public roads, according to Alphabet. A previous version misstated the number of miles.

WATCH: Tough quarter for Tesla

SHANGHAI — The tech race between the world's two largest economies just intensified.

China on Saturday released a global action plan for artificial intelligence, calling for international cooperation on tech development and regulation.

The news came as the annual state-organized World Artificial Intelligence Conference kicked off in Shanghai with an opening speech by Premier Li Qiang, who announced that the Chinese government has proposed the establishment of a global AI cooperation organization, according to an official readout.

Days earlier, U.S. President Donald Trump announced an American action plan for AI that included calls to reduce alleged ""woke"" bias in AI models and support the deployment of U.S. tech overseas.

""The two camps are now being formed,"" said George Chen, partner at the Asia Group and co-chair of the digital practice.

""China clearly wants to stick to the multilateral approach while the U.S. wants to build its own camp, very much targeting the rise of China in the field of AI,"" Chen said.

He noted how China may attract participants from its Belt and Road Initiative, while the U.S. will likely have the support of its allies, such as Japan and Australia.

In his speech, Premier Li emphasized China's ""AI plus"" plan for integrating the tech across industries and said the country was willing to help other nations with the technology, especially in the Global South. The category loosely refers to less developed economies, especially countries outside the U.S. and European orbits.

Since 2022, the U.S. has sought to restrict China's access to advanced semiconductors for training AI models. Earlier this month, U.S. chipmaker Nvidia said the U.S. was allowing it to resume shipments of a less advanced H20 chip to China after a roughly three-month pause.

However, China has been developing homegrown alternatives, which Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang both praised and described as ""formidable"" this month during his third trip to China this year.

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt met with Shanghai Party Secretary Chen Jining on Thursday in the city ahead of the AI conference, according to a city announcement. A representative for Schmidt declined to comment.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland over the weekend, aiming to reach a framework trade agreement shortly before a 30% tariff on EU imports takes effect.

In a post on social media platform X on Friday, the EU's von der Leyen said she had agreed to meet with the U.S. president on Sunday ""to discuss transatlantic trade relations, and how we can keep them strong.""

Trump later confirmed the meeting would take place as he arrived in Scotland on Friday evening, saying, ""We'll see if we can make a deal.""

""I think we have a good 50/50 chance. That's a lot,"" he added.

It comes amid a sense of growing optimism about the prospect of a tariff breakthrough, with sources telling CNBC that the current base-case scenario for a deal includes a 15% tariff on EU imports to the U.S.

Trump has threatened to impose tariffs of 30% on EU goods beginning Aug.1, prompting the EU to consider countermeasures as part of its response.

The U.S. and EU have the largest bilateral trade and investment relationship in the world, representing almost 30% of global trade in goods and services, and accounting for 43% of global gross domestic product, according to EU figures.

Trump's four-day, golf-heavy visit to Scotland is also expected to include an informal meeting with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

Unlike the EU, the U.K. recently struck a trade deal with the Trump administration, one which is centered on a 10% tariff baseline on British goods arriving in the U.S.

The European Commission's chief spokesperson, Paula Pinho, said Saturday that ""intensive negotiations"" at the technical and political level were ongoing between the EU and U.S.

""Leaders will now take stock and consider the scope for a balanced outcome that provides stability and predictability for businesses and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic,"" Pinho said.

Hopes of the U.S. and EU averting a transatlantic trade war by Aug. 1 have been buoyed at least in part by the recent announcement of a framework agreement between the U.S. and Japan.

The U.S.-Japan deal, which Trump described in a social media post as ""perhaps the largest Deal ever made,"" includes a baseline tariff rate of 15%.

Jack Allen-Reynolds, deputy chief euro zone economist at Capital Economics, said Friday that a similar framework for the EU might be seen as a case where a bad deal is better than no deal at all.

""Reports this week suggest that the EU and US are on the brink of agreeing a trade deal with a 15% baseline tariff on US imports from the bloc. It's hard to spin it as a good deal, but it would at least avoid much higher US tariffs and retaliation from the EU,"" Allen-Reynolds said in a research note.

About 14% of all U.S. households make $200,000 or more per year, according to 2023 Census data.

But a significant salary hasn't translated to big account balances for some of these consumers — which experts have dubbed ""HENRYs,"" or ""high earners, not rich yet.""

Rising costs, debt and lifestyle creep can leave them feeling stuck, experts say. Nearly two-thirds, or 62%, of people with salaries over $300,000 a year struggle with credit card debt, a new survey from BHG Financial found. Other reports have found many six-figure earners still live paycheck to paycheck.

""Earning doesn't actually make you feel rich; spending it does,"" said Sabrina Romanoff, a clinical psychologist. ""If most people spent 99% of their paycheck, they'd feel quite rich. And it's the paradox here. When we're in accumulation mode, it's very difficult to feel rich.""

Americans say they would need to make $520,000 a year, on average, to feel rich, according to a 2024 Bankrate survey.

The more money people earn, the more they say they need to feel comfortable. Americans making under $50,000 said they needed an average $157,000 a year to live comfortably, while those making at least $100,000 said they would need $246,000.

Marie Incontrera, 39, worked as a professional composer, bandleader and pianist before launching her virtual assistant business in 2016. She then expanded her business during the pandemic into a digital marketing consulting agency.

The career pivot has multiplied her income. Incontrera anticipates her business' revenue for 2025 to be around $1.4 million. She expects to take an owner's draw of $300,000 to $400,000 this year.

""I had a pretty successful career as a musician through most of my 20s,"" Incontrera told CNBC. ""But the thing they don't tell you about having a career as a musician in music school is that you can be playing Carnegie Hall, which I was, and I was making $15,000 a year.""

Despite her income going from $15,000 to $300,000 per year, Incontrera still doesn't feel rich.

""I would have thought back then that the amount of money that I have in the bank right now, I would be rich, right? I would have just thought, 'Oh, yeah, she's made it' ... and I don't feel that way,"" she said. ""I have more money anxiety, almost, now than I ever did in my 20s.""

""I feel very lucky. I feel privileged, but I do not feel rich,"" Incontrera said. ""I know that I am on a hamster wheel with my business. I actually really love the hamster wheel. I love what I do, but I also realize that I can't stop.""

That's not unusual, experts say.

""It can be pretty easy for someone to feel like, I'm making really good money, but I don't have a lot of discretionary income,"" said Kamila Elliott, CEO of wealth management firm Collective Wealth Partners in Atlanta, and member of the CNBC Financial Advisor Council.

""One of the things I focus on with my clients is a budget should be a representation of your values,"" Elliott said. ""The issue is you can't value everything ... You have to pick maybe one or two things where you're going to focus your discretionary spending and then take that extra and reroute that to savings so you can start feeling rich.""

Watch the video above to learn how spending habits can leave even high earners feeling like they're on a never-ending hamster wheel.

High-end spenders are painting a mixed picture when it comes to the luxury market's long-awaited recovery, with softer sales still weighing on company forecasts. 

But better-than-feared results from bellwether fashion house LVMH moved luxury stocks higher Friday, as investors bet on the emergence of green shoots of recovery.

LVMH posted a 4% year-on-year drop in second quarter sales to 19.5 billion euros after the market close Thursday, slightly below a consensus forecast for a 3% decline.

""This was not a stellar quarter for LVMH,"" Deutsche Bank's Adam Cochrane, a luxury equity research analyst, wrote in a Friday note. ""However, we see some glimmers of hope with a sequential improvement in cFX [constant currency] sales expected from 3Q onwards and most of the sales weakness related to weaker tourism.""

Here's a look at four key trends to look out for as earnings season rolls on, with fresh numbers due next week from Kering, Hermes and Prada.

Foreign exchange fluctuations are a perennial concern for luxury firms, but that's even more the case this quarter as they face high comparable sales from last year.

A sharp decline in the Japanese yen sparked a surge in tourist flows and luxury shopping in the country in 2024. But now brands are battling a rebalancing.

Richemont saw sales in Japan drop 15% year-on-year in the three months to June, following a 59% jump over the same period the year prior. Burberry also cited a ""challenging performance"" in Japan in the second quarter, and Moncler said Japan was its only negative-performing Asia market — both without providing specific figures.

Some firms noted, however, that a downturn in tourism to Japan — and to a lesser extent Europe — has resulted in an uptick in domestic spending in certain other markets.

""[In China] we have seen tangible improvement locally,"" said LVMH's Chief Financial Officer Cécile Cabanis during an earnings call Thursday, citing a ""repatriation from the big drop we've seen in tourism to Japan.""

Several luxury firms have also pointed to a strengthening of U.S. sales in the second quarter, even as consumers wait with bated breath for the impact of tariffs.

Burberry, Richemont, Moncler and Brunello Cucinelli all reported increased sales in their American markets over the second quarter, while LVMH noted that American demand was ""broadly unchanged.""

Still, the extent to which that uptick is driven by U.S. customers frontloading purchases ahead of the full onset of tariffs is not yet clear, according to the firms.

""To tell you that this was driven by an anticipation of buying links to the tariffs? Honestly, I cannot tell you,"" Roberto Eggs, Moncler's chief business strategy and global market officer, said on an earnings call Wednesday.

Luxury companies have also been honing in on the U.S. market in recent quarters in a bid to compensate for continued soft demand in the key Chinese market.

Burberry CEO Joshua Schulman said the company's recent U.S. growth indicated the ""diversity of the luxury consumer that exists in that market,"" from elite, high-spenders to high-traffic mall shoppers.

U.S. tariffs are nonetheless weighing on the outlook for most European luxury houses, who rely heavily on localized production as part of their cache.

As such, many have suggested that they will need to raise prices in the coming quarters to offset added costs.

Brunello Cucinelli flagged price hikes of 3% to 4% in the U.S. while Moncler said it was implementing ""mid-single-digit"" percentage increases for the coming 12 months. Burberry, meanwhile, said it began adjusting prices last year as part of broader overhaul plans.

LVMH, on the other hand, said Thursday that prices rises would need to come with an ""improvement in the product"" or modest rebalancing around inflation.

However, the French luxury conglomerate then went on to cite price hikes among ""several levers"" at its disposal to counter the impact of tariffs.

It comes as the cost of luxury goods has risen by an average of 3% so far this year — the slowest pace since 2019 — according to UBS' evidence lab, as brands have sought to reconcile consumer retention with higher input costs following a Covid-era surge in prices.

Finally, category mix remains a fundamental factor in the divided luxury picture, with brand appeal playing as much of a role as the product type itself.

Jewelry remains a winning play for Cartier-owner Richemont, even as high-end watches — both its own and those of other luxury watchmakers — remain a weak point.

Tiffany-owner LVMH, however, continues to battle softness in its jewelry and fashion and leather goods maisons, despite leather handbags going from strength to strength for ultra-luxe brand Hermes.

Carole Madjo, Barclays' head of European luxury goods research, told CNBC that she expects leather goods dominance to continue to play out when Hermes reports on Wednesday.

""[Hermes] is always very good, thanks to leather goods mostly,"" she told ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, investors will be eagerly awaiting more color on Tuesday from Gucci-owner Kering on its product overhaul under artistic director Demna Gvasalia and incoming CEO Luca de Meo.

""Bringing newness, something fresh which has not been seen before, is I think what could make Gucci great again,"" Madjo said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Credit cards can be an 'amazing tool' for your wedding, expert says — but only if you're 'strategic'","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/26/using-credit-cards-to-pay-for-your-wedding.html","Sat, 26 Jul 2025 11:00:01 GMT","



Many engaged couples in the U.S. are relying on forms of credit to pay for their wedding. Experts say that approach can be smart, if done carefully.

While 46% of surveyed newlyweds — couples who tied the knot within the past two years — used mostly savings to pay for costs, 24% paid with credit cards, according to a report by LendingTree. The site polled 1,050 newlyweds in early March.

A separate report by Zola, based on a survey of 6,000 couples getting married in 2025, found that 31% of engaged couples polled plan to use credit cards to pay for their wedding, including using points or applying for new cards.

""If you're strategic, a credit card can be an amazing tool,"" said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree.

Otherwise, a credit card can be a slippery slope, leading couples to walk down the aisle with long-lasting and expensive debt, experts say.

About 67% of surveyed newlyweds took on debt for their wedding, according to LendingTree.

For new cards, the average annual percentage rate, or the borrowing cost, is 24.35%, the highest since December, LendingTree found.

""Ultimately, a beautiful wedding should never come at the cost of financial stress to a new marriage,"" said Gloria Garcia Cisneros, a certified financial planner at LourdMurray, an investment and wealth management firm.

Weddings are becoming more expensive every year. The average cost for a wedding in 2025 is expected to be $36,000, according to Zola. That's up from $33,000 in 2024, and $29,000 in 2023.

If you have savings set aside to cover your wedding costs, charging the expense to a credit card and then immediately using those savings to pay off the bill can help you earn rewards such as points or miles, said Schulz.

Some credit cards offer big sign-up bonuses when you spend a set amount on the card within a short period of opening it. That might be more than you spend on normal expenses, but within reach if you have big expenses — such as wedding-related purchases and deposits — coming up.

By immediately paying that charge off with your savings, you can take advantage of the rewards for things such as your honeymoon, Schulz said.

""It's a way to make those savings work even harder for you,"" he said.

Using a credit card can have other advantages, too. Credit cards offer layers of federal protection that can help cardholders dispute charges and get a refund if things go awry with an item or service purchased with a card, experts say.

Some cards also offer purchase protections, a form of insurance against theft or damages, per NerdWallet. Make sure to read the fine print of what your credit card offers and how long the terms last.

However, the key with credit cards ""is to pay in full,"" said Ted Rossman, a senior industry analyst at Bankrate. 

""I definitely would not recommend putting wedding expenses on a card if you're going to be dragging that out over time,"" he said.

Not paying the balance off will leave you with high-interest debt as you start your new marriage.

Nearly a quarter, or 24%, of newlyweds married within two years of the survey are still paying the debt off, according to LendingTree. Of those that still owe money, 47% said they will finish paying the debt in six months to a year.

""You don't want to sacrifice your long-term well-being for a short-term event,"" Rossman said.

A 0% APR credit card can be a tool for wedding payments, as you'll be paying little to no interest on outstanding balances for a period of time. However, make sure to finish paying off the card before the promotion expires, experts say. Otherwise, whatever balance is left will then get interest tacked on.

As you begin to plan the wedding and reach out to vendors, ask if they accept credit cards as a form of payment, said Jason Rhee, a wedding planner in Los Angeles.

Some vendors might take only cash or check payments, while others might charge additional processing fees for credit cards, Rhee said. Such additional charges can range from 1.5% to 3.5%, according to Bankrate.

Assess whether paying the extra cost is both affordable and worth it to you, or if it's best to use a different form of payment with the vendor, said Lauren Kay, executive editor of The Knot.

What's more, some vendors may offer discounts for payments in cash.

While credit cards can offer certain protections to incurred payments or purchases, they might not offer broader protections or policies to cover larger expenditures, such as the reception or the venue, Kay said.

""In most instances, your credit card wouldn't offer any real benefit if something were to go wrong with a purchase of that magnitude,"" said Kay.

For such expenses, wedding insurance policies can be a good option to consider. They help protect you from unexpected risks such as extreme weather, theft or a vendor who didn't show up, said Kay.

Wedding insurance policy pricing can range from less than $100 to more than $1,000, according to NerdWallet, depending on the size of your policy and the kinds of coverage.

""It's important to think about what you're hoping to protect,"" Kay said.

The ongoing rise of artificial intelligence is having a significant impact on many types of jobs, particularly entry-level positions and especially on roles that involve lots of automation. And while AI might not be eliminating a large percentage of early career jobs, as recent headlines have proclaimed, it certainly is changing them in a big way.

""AI is reshaping entry-level roles by automating routine, manual tasks,"" said Fawad Bajwa, global AI, data, and analytics practice leader at executive search and leadership advisory firm Russell Reynolds Associates. ""Instead of drafting emails, cleaning basic data, or coordinating meeting schedules, early-career professionals have begun curating AI-enabled outputs and applying judgment.""

For example, people working in entry-level marketing jobs are using generative AI to create first drafts of promotional or campaign documents, and early career data analysts are relying on AI to prepare datasets, Bajwa said.

""AI is reshaping all jobs,"" said Zanele Munyikwa, an economist at labor analytics firm Revelio Labs. He pointed out that hiring for entry-level jobs is down in general, regardless of AI exposure. ""AI-exposed entry-level jobs are seeing bigger drops in demand, but the difference to non-exposed jobs is small,"" he said.

What AI is doing is forcing an ""occupational transformation"" among entry-level roles, Munyikwa said. For example, the firm's research has shown that tasks performed by junior-level professionals are shifting toward less AI-exposed functions.

The most AI-exposed jobs tend to be technical, such as data engineers, database administrators, IT specialists, and cybersecurity personnel, as well as financial workers such as auditors, Munyikwa said. And in an interesting twist, the most exposed jobs are also adopting AI the most, making them more productive, he said.

In some of these occupations, up to 30% of workers are already using AI to perform their day-to-day tasks, according to Revelio Labs' research, and for those who use these tools, the productivity gains can be significant.

""Increases in productivity may eventually lead to fewer headcounts in certain job families, but also create jobs elsewhere,"" Munyikwa said. ""While AI may currently have some productivity boosting capabilities, it needs to be applied and used consistently across large parts of the organization to take effect.""

That requires investments in AI tool training and thoughtful restructuring of job requirements and capabilities, Munyikwa said. ""This will take a lot of time and careful leadership to even partially achieve big cost savings,"" he said.

Jobs with low AI exposure frequently involve tasks that are difficult to automate, the Revelio Labs' research noted. These positions include manual jobs in manufacturing, hospitality roles, or interpersonal work, which still require a steady pipeline of human workers. Compared with 2010, demand for these roles has grown more quickly than for high-exposure roles, the research said.

To be sure, AI is already eliminating some entry-level functions in companies. ""Generally, jobs that are repetitive, rule-based, and easily codified are most at risk,"" Bajwa said. Many are not disappearing overnight but rather are being fundamentally transformed and restructured to involve more oversight and less manual work, he said.

Although it is highly unlikely that there would be a significant impact on entry-level jobs in the short term, Bajwa said, ""organizations must redesign how early talent is onboarded, developed, and integrated in order to navigate the decade ahead,"" he said. ""Without foundational tasks, it's harder for people to build experience, leading to a fundamental gap in terms of how new professionals will build judgment, confidence and fluency.""

In fact, 54% of the 3,000 executives from Russell Reynolds' global network that the company surveyed are concerned that AI reliance is eroding critical thinking, and one-quarter are worried about AI inadvertently undermining product/service quality and critical internal process quality. 

A growing number of leaders across industries are also concerned about AI-driven layoffs, according to the RRA research. Last year 20% said they were concerned, compared with 40%in the latest survey.

CIOs and other technology leaders need to be prepared for the impact of AI on current and future entry-level jobs within their departments, especially considering how aggressively many are launching AI initiatives.

""It changes both talent strategy and team design,"" Bajwa said. ""Tech leaders must now rethink how they develop junior talent and build future pipelines. The goal isn't just efficiency; it's ensuring AI-augmented teams can still grow, learn and lead,"" he said. 

With the possible reduction in some entry-level technology positions, there is a potential for more top-heavy team structures, Muniykwa said. ""Tech leaders need to redesign workflows and roles as they implement AI,"" he said.

Businesses will need new ""on-ramps"", for example, apprenticeships and AI-assisted boot camps, so early-career talent can still learn and advance even as some traditional entry-level tasks disappear, Munyikwa said. ""Leaders must plan for continuous upskilling, not one-off training sessions, to keep teams productive alongside rapidly evolving AI tools,"" he said.

Rehearsing a big presentation or jotting down some notes before a one-on-one meeting with your boss is normal.

You should use a similar, truncated practice before casual interactions, recommends conversation expert Alison Wood Brooks: Take 30 seconds before greeting the other person to think about topics to go over, questions you want to ask or your goals for the conversation.

Putting forethought into your casual chats can make you look smart, prepared and considerate — like a good friend who remembers even minute details of past conversations — says Wood Brooks, a Harvard University associate professor who teaches an MBA course called ""How to talk gooder in business and life.""

Try preparing for even casual conversations, whether you're meeting a co-worker for lunch or an old friend for dinner, Wood Brooks advises. ""Even if you're calling a friend you know well or your mom, what we find in our research is that even 30 seconds of forethought will make that conversation go better,"" she says.

A small moment of mental preparation can help you stay present while you're talking and listening, says Wood Brooks, author of the 2025 book, ""Talk: The Science of Conversation and the Art of Being Ourselves."" After the conversation starts, you'll have less brainpower to come up with talking prompts or conversational segues, she adds.

""Once the conversation is underway, your brain becomes very busy ... listening to the other person's words, trying to read their emotional expressions, preparing what you're going to say next,"" says Wood Brooks. ""It's a very cognitively overwhelming task. We're better at brainstorming what we should talk about ... before that conversation begins.""

Sharp communication skills can help build relationships and propel your career, but being a good conversationalist often takes continual practice, Wood Brooks says.

For example, you can always practice focusing more on the other person than yourself, speaking expert and author John Bowe wrote for CNBC Make It on September 25. ""You've asked this person for their attention; now give them yours,"" wrote Bowe. ""Concentrate on what they're saying and try to intuit why they're saying it. Everything else will come naturally.""

One particularly powerful phrase, according to conversation expert and Stanford University lecturer Matt Abrahams: ""Tell me more.""

""'Tell me more' is a support response; it supports what the other person is saying. The opposite is a 'shift' response,"" which is a statement that shifts the conversation back to you,"" Abrahams wrote in October 2023, adding: ""So many people make the mistake of treating other people's stories as openings for them to talk about themselves. But if you do that often, you miss an opportunity to learn more.""

There are a number of factors to take into consideration when choosing where you want to retire, including the lifestyle you want and your financial situation.

In addition to looking for options that meet most of your needs, you'll want to consider any major downsides or trade-offs you'd have to make, such as a lack of accessible health care or a high cost of living.

Financial services website Bankrate recently ranked all 50 states based on 15 metrics, including affordability, health care and weather, to determine the best and worst places to retire in the U.S. The study used data from a variety of sources, including the Council for Community and Economic Research, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

The metrics were weighed according to survey responses gathered by Bankrate in May 2025 on what Americans say are their top priorities for choosing a retirement destination. As a result, affordability, weather and neighborhood safety influenced overall scores the most.

Here are the 10 worst states to retire, according to Bankrate, where you may have to compromise when it comes to cost, safety and access to health care:

Weather also played a significant role in landing several of these states at the bottom of the overall rankings. Louisiana ranked No. 39 for weather and Texas came in at No. 47 in that category.

""Natural disasters really degraded the scores of almost every state across the Gulf. Texas, Florida — even states that you really think about as primary retirement destinations,"" Stephen Kates, a certified financial planner and Bankrate financial analyst, tells CNBC Make It. ""They didn't do as well in the weather category because of their propensity to have hurricanes and other natural disasters.""

It can be helpful to consider these rankings and the metrics used to determine them, but ultimately, the best place for you to retire will depend on your personal preferences. 

Retiring in Louisiana or Oklahoma may look challenging based on these metrics, for example, but if that's where your family lives and you want to be close to them, it may be worth planning ahead and figuring out how to live well there, despite potential drawbacks.

If living in a tax-friendly state is important to you, Wyoming may be your best fit, Kates says. The state came in at No. 3 overall and No. 1 for tax-friendliness. But you'd be giving up other potential amenities.

""You pay very little state taxes, but you have little access to some of the other things that you may want,"" he says. ""Wyoming is not great for arts and entertainment — it's a big, more rural place.""

Conditions can also vary greatly within a given state when it comes to metrics like neighborhood safety. State-level data can be a good place to start, but you may need to dig deeper or visit in person to determine if an area is right for you, especially if you're considering a big state like California or Texas, Kates says.

""Where you live in California or Texas or Florida, or any state, is going to matter because we're aggregating a lot of data,"" he says. ""If you live in Los Angeles, it's going to be very different than if you live in Sacramento or La Jolla; if you live in Dallas, very different [than] Houston.""

You may choose not to relocate in retirement, or prefer to wait until later on to make a move. As people live longer than they used to and thus may be retired longer, it's wise to think about your retirement in phases, Kates says.

""It's a lot more than just putting a pin on the map and saying, 'This is the place,'"" he says. ""If you're going to live in retirement for 25 or 30 years, there's going to be phases of that. And how you figure that out is extremely relevant.""

If you want to dedicate time to traveling in your early retirement years, it may not make sense to also try to move your home base during that period. But a decade or so later, you may be more interested in settling down somewhere new.

Kates calls these the ""go, low-go and no-go"" phases of retirement, alluding to idea that as you get older, you'll likely want or need to slow down.

President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff powers and recent trade deals could soon run into a legal buzzsaw.

A federal appeals court is set to hear oral arguments next week in a high-profile lawsuit challenging Trump's stated authority to effectively slap tariffs at any level on any country at any time, so long as he deems them necessary to address a national emergency.

The Trump administration says that that expansive tariff power derives from the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA.

The bulk of Trump's biggest tariffs — including his fentanyl-related duties on Canada, Mexico and China, and the worldwide ""reciprocal"" tariffs he first unveiled in early April — rest on his invocation of that law.

The U.S. Court of International Trade struck those tariffs down in late May, ruling that Trump exceeded his authority under IEEPA.

But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit quickly paused that decision, keeping the tariffs in effect while Trump's legal challenge plays out.

The case, known as V.O.S. Selections v. Trump, is the furthest along of more than half a dozen federal lawsuits challenging Trump's use of the emergency-powers law.

It's set for oral argument before the Federal Circuit on Thursday morning.

""I think the tariffs are at risk,"" said Ted Murphy, partner and head of global trade practice at law firm Sidley Austin, in an interview with CNBC.

The law has ""never been used for this purpose,"" and it's ""being used quite broadly,"" Murphy said. ""So I think there are legitimate questions.""

IEEPA gives Trump some powers to deal with national emergencies stemming from ""any unusual and extraordinary threat"" that comes in whole or in large part from outside the U.S.

But attorneys representing the handful of small businesses that sued Trump argue that the law does not let him unilaterally impose tariffs.

""IEEPA nowhere mentions tariffs, duties, imposts, or taxes, and no other President in the statute's nearly 50-year history has claimed that it authorizes tariffs,"" they wrote in a court brief this month.

Attorneys for Trump and his administration, however, argue that Congress has long empowered presidents to impose tariffs to address key national concerns.

They argue that the statute's language authorizing Trump to ""regulate … importation"" means he can use it to impose tariffs.

No matter how the Federal Circuit ultimately rules in V.O.S., the case appears destined for the Supreme Court, which bears a 6-3 conservative majority and includes three justices appointed by Trump.

But some experts still expect that Trump's IEEPA tariffs will be scrapped.

""Trump will probably continue to lose in the lower courts, and we believe the Supreme Court is highly unlikely to rule in his favor,"" U.S. policy analysts from Piper Sandler wrote in a research note Friday morning.

The analysts wrote that such a loss would effectively mean the collapse of almost every trade development that Trump has held up as an accomplishment during his first six months in office.

""If the Supreme Court rules against Trump, all of the trade deals Trump has reached in recent weeks — and those he will reach in the coming days — are illegal,"" the analysts wrote.

""So are his letters informing countries of their new tariffs, the current 10% minimum, and the reciprocal tariffs he has proposed or threatened,"" they added.

It is technically unclear whether everything Piper Sandler describes is undergirded by IEEPA. For instance, Trump has recently announced only the broad outlines of trade agreements with Japan, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines — and those deals have yet to be finalized.

However, Trump in mid-June signed an executive order specifying that he is invoking the emergency-powers law as part of a U.S. trade agreement with the United Kingdom.

Trump this month has also sent 25 letters to individual world leaders, dictating the new tariff rates that their countries' U.S. exports will face starting Aug. 1.

That is the date when Trump's reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries' imports — which were unveiled in early April and then repeatedly put on pause — are set to turn back on. Trump has said that his letters are tantamount to bilateral trade deals.

Those letters do not explicitly reference IEEPA. But their language echoes the same arguments about unfair trade, deficits and national security that Trump invoked during his reciprocal tariff rollout.

""The Administration is legally and fairly using tariff powers that have been granted to the executive branch by the Constitution and Congress to level the playing field for American workers and safeguard our national security,"" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CNBC.

The White House ignored CNBC's request to confirm that Trump's leader-to-leader letters, and the tariff rates set in his recent spate of trade deals, hinge on IEEPA authority.

It has, however, confirmed that the massive 50% tariff Trump set on imports from Brazil did, in fact, rely on IEEPA powers.

Strangely, that letter focused less on trade and more on Trump's gripes about Brazil's treatment of its former president, Jair Bolsonaro, who is facing trial over his role in an alleged coup to overturn his 2022 reelection loss.

One day after the federal trade court issued its May decision in V.O.S., U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras delivered an even broader ruling against the Trump administration in a separate case in Washington, D.C., federal court.

The three-judge panel in V.O.S. specifically found that some of the tariffs Trump had imposed were unauthorized by IEEPA. But Contreras, in the case known as Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump, ruled that the law itself does not allow a president to take any unilateral tariff actions.

The government appealed that ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which paused a preliminary injunction that Contreras had issued. Oral arguments in the case are set for Sept. 30.

Two other federal lawsuits challenging the tariffs — one from the state of California, and one filed in Montana federal court by members of the indigenous Blackfeet nation — are set for separate oral arguments on Sept. 17 before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

At least three more pending cases before the Court of International Trade have been stayed until a final decision is returned in V.O.S., according to the Congressional Research Service.

Two-thirds of Americans drink coffee every single day, according to data collected by the National Coffee Association in 2022, and the debate about how much is too much and whether or not any amount of caffeine is safe persists. But recent research shows that the answer is more complicated than you'd think.

A Harvard study, that followed nearly 50,000 women over the course of 30 years and published in June, found that drinking coffee every day may lead to healthy aging in women. One to three cups a day was also linked to heart health benefits and lower mortality rates.

But research also shows that high coffee consumption can increase your likelihood of dementia. And a 2022 paper published in the Journal of the American Heart Association found a link between heavy coffee consumption and an increased risk of dying from cardiovascular disease in people with hypertension.

Benefits, drawbacks, and the right amount all depend on your individual lifestyle and overall health. And health experts consistently advise that, like with most things, moderation is key for your daily coffee.

Deepak Chopra, author, speaker and proponent of alternative medicine, told CNBC Make It in 2023 that he drinks two to three cups of coffee each day before noon. While that may sound like too much caffeine for the average person, it's actually within a healthy range.

""Drinking two to three cups before noon is safe to do,"" registered dietitian Roxana Ehsani said in an interview with CNBC Make It last year. ""As long as they don't greatly surpass 400 milligrams of caffeine.""

Ehsani's suggestion follows the Food and Drug Administration's recommendation of consuming no more than 400 milligrams of caffeine a day, which can include the caffeine found in teas, energy drinks, sodas and chocolate.

Certain people may benefit from consuming much less caffeine than is recommended by the FDA.

Caffeine tolerance varies from person to person, with some people feeling anxious or jittery after just one or two cups of coffee.

""Within those milligram or cup of coffee recommendations, if you start feeling overly tired and the caffeine is not helping, then you've got to stop [drinking it],"" dietitian Jessica Sylvester told NBC News.

""If your heart starts beating incredibly fast, you've got to stop. It's different for each person.""

Pregnant people should consider cutting back on caffeine. And people who have diabetes or cardiovascular disease should be mindful of their sugar intake when having coffee, Nikki Cota, a dietitian at the Mayo Clinic, told NBC News.

Expert opinion also varies on if teens should drink coffee, but ""avoiding caffeine is the best choice for all kids,"" according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.

But for everyone else, if you're having two to three cups, or more, ""be mindful of what you're experiencing,"" registered dietitian Maddie Pasquariello says. And make sure you're not replacing meals with caffeine.

Ehsani recommends drinking water or having a meal before reaching for coffee since caffeine suppresses appetite.

And if you notice your sleep is affected when you have a coffee in the afternoon, experts suggest a mornings-only rule for your daily latte or macchiato.

In this article

There are two schools of thought around CBS' decision to end ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.""

The first says the cancellation is a one-off exit from the storied time slot — that Paramount was trying to push through the red tape to finally merge with Skydance Media, a deal that was approved by the Federal Communications Commission Thursday after more than a year in limbo.

The other says it signals the beginning of the end of late night TV.

The entertainment industry will have a better sense of where the truth lies next year when Disney decides the fate of Jimmy Kimmel's late night show, ""Jimmy Kimmel Live.""

While NBC recently extended the contracts of its two late night hosts, Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers, into 2028, Kimmel's contract is set to lapse in 2026.

""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" has been a late night staple since 2003, acting not only as a typical talk show on the circuit, but as a valuable marketing hub for Disney's slate of theatrical and television content. In addition to traditional one-on-one interviews, Kimmel will also frequently host several stars from the same project, often for blockbuster titles from Marvel, Star Wars and the company's animated franchises.

Clips from these chats are fed onto Kimmel's YouTube channel, which has more than 20 million subscribers, and across social media, helping to generate buzz for upcoming Disney projects.

For comparison, Fallon's show account has around 32 million subscribers, while Colbert's stands at 10 million and Meyers' at just over 5 million.

Kimmel is also a frequent host of the Academy Awards, which airs on Disney's ABC, and is currently the host of ABC's celebrity edition of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire."" These ancillary assignments, as well as his annual job closing out Disney's Upfronts presentation for advertisers, may make Kimmel more important to Disney's long-term future than Colbert was for Paramount or CBS.

Still, while the next test of media's commitment to late night is months off, the end of ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"" is calling attention to the mounting pressures on traditional TV and raising questions about the whether the time slot can survive the evolving viewing landscape.

The cost of producing late night programs has risen as the media industry has been upended by streaming and shifting consumer habits. The traditional pay TV bundle has lost millions of customers in recent years, and as they've disappeared, so too have advertising dollars.

The shifting equation has forced media companies to rebalance.

At a large scale, companies like Comcast's NBCUniversal and Warner Bros. Discovery have opted to split off their cable TV networks into separate corporate entities.

At the programming level, big shows are increasingly greenlit for release on streaming services rather than traditional networks. Salaries of highly paid news anchors have moderated, with some stepping away from traditional networks entirely and starting out their own ventures. And much of the money spent on bulking up both linear TV networks and streaming services is earmarked for live sports.

That leaves familiar titles in flux.

""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"" employed around 200 people and recorded annual losses of around $40 million, according to a person familiar with the matter, who declined to be named speaking about nonpublic matters. ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" employs around 250 people and loses roughly the same amount, according to a person familiar with that show's finances.

While the pay-TV bundle still rakes in the highest share of profits for legacy media companies – much of which stems from the fees that pay-TV distributors hand over to the networks to be included in the bundle – that figure is in decline.

Linear TV advertising revenue has also been on a steady downward slope. Industry analysts and experts expected the ad market to stabilize in 2025 after tumultuous streaming-centric years, but macroeconomic uncertainty has hampered the recovery.

In quarterly earnings that were reported in May, Paramount, NBCUniversal and Disney each reported lower ad sales on a year-over-year basis.

Paramount reported in May that its first-quarter TV advertising revenue was down 21% to $2.04 billion, mainly due to comparisons to the prior-year period when the company had the Super Bowl. That championship beckons the most ad dollars of any live event on TV. Without the Super Bowl, ad revenue would have been flat, the company said. Overall revenue for Paramount's TV segment was down 13%.

Of the traditional TV ad spend that does remain, the biggest share has gravitated to live sports, which draw the biggest audiences. NBCUniversal recently touted its record ad sales volume during the most recent Upfront cycle due to an upcoming slate of NBA, the Super Bowl, Winter Olympics and other sports.

Disney reported in May that quarterly revenue for its domestic linear networks was down 3% to $2.2 billion, attributing the decline to lower ad revenue. Still, Disney noted ad revenue for ESPN and sports in general saw an increase in ad revenue.

These headwinds help legitimize Paramount's decision to cancel ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" but the timing of the program's end has raised suspicions.

The announcement that Colbert's show would take its final bow in May 2026 came just days after the tenured host publicly called out Paramount for its $16 million settlement with President Donald Trump over the editing of a ""60 Minutes"" interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris.

Colbert called the settlement a ""big fat bribe"" during one of his show-opening monologues, referencing the then-pending merger between Paramount and Skydance Media, which required the approval of the Trump administration to proceed.

Paramount and CBS executives released a statement last week saying the cancellation was ""purely a financial decision against the challenging backdrop in late night.""

""It is not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount,"" the company continued.

While ratings for Colbert's show have declined over the last decade, the program has consistently achieved the highest views of any show in the 11:35 p.m. hour, outdrawing ABC's ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" and NBC's ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,"" according to Nielsen.

Still, Colbert's ratings have been declining each season. For the most recent September-to-May time period, Colbert averaged roughly 1.9 million viewers, with the majority of viewership coming in the age demographic of over 65, according to Nielsen — a telling data point about the state of TV viewership.

Kimmel's viewership paints a similar picture, with viewership dropping from the September-to-May time period in 2019-2020 to the most recent in 2024-2025, when the average was nearly 1.6 million viewers, according to Nielsen.

When Paramount listed its slate of highly rated TV shows during its last earnings report, including ""Tracker,"" the top rated series and ""Matlock,"" the highest rated new series, it also listed Colbert's ""The Late Show"" as the highest rated broadcast late night show. ""The Daily Show,"" also from Paramount, was the top late night show on cable TV.

Some industry experts have questioned whether CBS could have explored other ways to save money — or save late night — besides outright canceling ""The Late Show."" NBC cut costs by eliminating the band on Meyers' late night show and shifting Fallon to four nights a week instead of five.

CBS tried to bring a younger demographic into the hour with ""After Midnight,"" a late night show that ran after Colbert. The show was hosted by comedian Taylor Tomlinson and was centered on viral internet phenomena.

Though CBS intended to renew the show after its first two seasons, Tomlinson decided not to extend her contract, and the show was canceled.

Disclosure: Comcast owns NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC.

Two flight attendants on a Southwest Airlines flight departing from Burbank, California, were injured and being treated on Friday after pilots took evasive action to avoid another aircraft, the airline said.

Southwest Flight 1496 sharply descended nearly 500 feet, according to flight tracking websites.

The airline and the Federal Aviation Administration said pilots took action after receiving alerts of a potential collision. The Southwest Boeing 737 continued on to Las Vegas, where it landed uneventfully.

The FAA is investigating.

No passengers were injured, but a passenger identified as Caitlin Burdi told Fox News Digital the sharp descent stirred panic onboard.

""We really thought we were plummeting to a plane crash,"" she was quoted as saying.

According to a statement from Southwest, the incident began when its crew responded to ""two onboard traffic alerts"" while taking off from Burbank, ""requiring them to climb and descend to comply with the alerts.""

The incident came a week after a SkyWest Airlines jet operating as a Delta Connection flight from Minneapolis reported taking evasive action to avoid a possible collision with a U.S. Air Force bomber during a landing approach over North Dakota.

The FAA said on Monday it was investigating last Friday's near-miss incident involving SkyWest Flight 3788, an Embraer EMBR3.SA ERJ-175 regional jet, which landed safely at Minot, North Dakota.

The Air Force confirmed a B-52 aircraft assigned to Minot Air Force Base had conducted a flyover of the North Dakota State Fair last Friday and that military investigators were looking into the matter.

The Trump administration has taken direct stakes in companies on a scale rarely seen in the U.S. outside wartime or economic crisis, pushing a Republican Party that traditionally championed free-market capitalism to embrace state intervention in industries viewed as important for national security.

Japan's Nippon Steel agreed to give President Donald Trump a ""golden share"" in U.S. Steel as a condition for the two companies' controversial merger. Trump now personally wields sweeping veto power over major business decisions made by the nation's third-largest steel producer.

""You know who has the golden share? I do,"" Trump said at a summit on artificial intelligence and energy in Pittsburgh on July 15.

The president's golden share in U.S. Steel is similar to nationalizing a company but without any of the benefits that a company normally receives, such as direct investment by the government, said Sarah Bauerle Danzman, an expert on foreign investment and national security at the Atlantic Council, a think tank focused on international affairs.

But the Trump administration demonstrated earlier this month that it is also willing to buy directly into publicly traded corporations. The Department of Defense agreed to purchase a $400 million equity stake in rare-earth miner MP Materials, making the Pentagon the company's largest shareholder.

This level of support by the federal government for a mining company is unprecedented, said Gracelin Baskaran, an expert on critical minerals at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

""This is the biggest public-private cooperation that the mining industry has ever had here in the United States,"" Baskaran said. ""Historically, DOD has never done equity in a mining company or a mining project.""

Trump's unique hold over the Republican Party gives him the ability to intervene in companies on a scale that would be difficult politically for a Democratic president, Danzman said.

""The Democrat would have been accused of being a communist and a lot of other Republicans probably would not have felt comfortable moving in this particular direction because of their greater commitment to market principles,"" Danzman said. Trump is expanding the range of what is possible in the U.S. in terms of state intervention in markets, she said.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

More interventions could be on the horizon as the Trump administration develops a policy to support U.S. companies in strategic industries against state-backed competition from China.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in April that the U.S. government might need to make an ""equity investment in each of these companies that's taking on China in critical minerals."" The Pentagon's investment in MP Materials is a model for future public-private partnerships, CEO James Litinsky said.

""It's a new way forward to accelerate free markets, to get the supply chain on shore that we want,"" Litinsky told CNBC. The U.S. government is helping the mining industry fight ""Chinese mercantilism,"" the CEO said.

Meanwhile, the golden share in U.S. Steel is a potential model for foreign direct investment ""transactions that really affect our national security but where it's going to be great for our economic growth,"" Sen. Dave McCormick, R-Pa., said in a May interview with CNBC.

""Having taken a stake in US Steel and MP, we're now left to wonder where this administration will find its next investment,"" Don Bilson, an analyst at Gordon Haskett, wrote in a note to clients earlier this month.

Trump proposed in January that the U.S. should take a 50% stake in social media app TikTok as part of a joint venture. China's ByteDance is required under a recently passed law to divest TikTok or the platform will be banned in the U.S. Trump extended ByteDance's compliance deadline until Sept. 17.

The U.S. has a long history of intervening in industries, particularly where national defense is concerned, said Mark Wilson, a historian at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, who studies the military-industrial complex.

But past interventions were often temporary and typically happened during war, economic crisis or took the form of bailouts to prevent a major player in a critical industry from going bankrupt.

The U.S. government bought a majority stake in General Motors to prevent the automaker from collapsing in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, ultimately selling off its shares at a loss to the taxpayer. In the 1970s, defense giant Lockheed and automaker Chrysler received government bailouts.

During World War I, President Woodrow Wilson nationalized the railroads, but he returned them to private ownership after the conflict. The Roosevelt administration made sweeping interventions during the Great Depression and World War II, from establishing the Tennessee Valley Authority to making big investments in the nation's manufacturing capacity.

The U.S. is not fighting an economic crisis or war today, but the return of great power competition with Russia and China and the supply chain disruptions of the Covid-19 pandemic have led to more nationalistic economic policies, said UNC's Wilson.

The U.S. has increasingly recognized that China's economic model is based on manufacturing overcapacity that dumps products ""onto global markets in ways that make it hard for other markets to compete,"" Danzman said.

The threat posed by China's dominance of the rare-earth supply chain became apparent in April when Beijing imposed export restrictions against the U.S., Baskaran said. Within weeks, automakers warned they would have to halt production due to a rare-earth shortage, forcing the U.S. back to the negotiating table with Beijing, she said.

""The historical moment we're in does seem to be one where there is this reassessment of assumptions of the previous generation about the efficacy of markets and free trade to solve all our problems in national security,"" Wilson said.

The question is whether state intervention can solve the failure of the free market to address national security concerns in industries like rare earths, Danzman said.

""When you step in to try to address one of these market failures with this kind of government intervention, you can have a cascade of new market failures,"" she said. ""You're distorting the market more.""

 Bitcoin has already achieved major highs that very few thought possible. The ink on the current drivers of its all-time high is still wet.One of the major catalysts was the introduction of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in early 2024, such as BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF.

In addition, US President Donald Trump's executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in March 2025, capitalized with approximately 200,000 Bitcoin (BTC), sent a clear message of government support. This further reinforced Bitcoin's growing status as a legitimate asset and helped boost investor confidence.

 So, is $1 million per Bitcoin a realistic target? Several key factors suggest that it is entirely possible, though achieving it will require a lot. Limited supply: Bitcoin's scarcity is one of its most compelling features. With a capped supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin's value naturally increases as demand rises. The limited supply ensures that Bitcoin cannot be inflated like fiat currencies, making it a potential store of value similar to gold.Institutional investment: The influx of institutional investment is changing Bitcoin's market dynamics. As large financial institutions enter the market, Bitcoin's legitimacy is solidified, creating more demand and pushing prices higher.Crypto adoption potential: Approximately 6.8% of the global population now owns cryptocurrency, equating to over 560 million people (with a compound annual growth rate of around 34%). There's plenty of room for growth. FOMO: A 2025 survey by Security.org found that 67% of current cryptocurrency owners primarily invest in digital assets like Bitcoin with the expectation of making money. As Bitcoin's price continues to rise, more investors are subjected to fear of missing out.  

So, is $1 million per Bitcoin a realistic target? Several key factors suggest that it is entirely possible, though achieving it will require a lot. 

 Several prominent figures have predicted that Bitcoin could reach $1 million per coin, with their projections highlighting the increasing potential for the cryptocurrency.Cathie Wood has been a vocal advocate for Bitcoin, predicting that the cryptocurrency could hit $1.5 million by 2030 in ARK Invest's “Bull Case” scenario. Michael Saylor, the founder of Strategy, has repeatedly stated that Bitcoin's price will hit $1 million when Wall Street holds 10% of its reserves in Bitcoin. Robert Kiyosaki shares a similar sentiment, predicting that Bitcoin could hit $1 million by 2030. He views Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, much like precious metals. 

Several prominent figures have predicted that Bitcoin could reach $1 million per coin, with their projections highlighting the increasing potential for the cryptocurrency.



 To reach $1 million per Bitcoin, several things need to happen in the market. Here's a breakdown of the major factors:Much more institutional investmentFor Bitcoin to reach $1 million, its market cap would need to exceed $21 trillion — surpassing gold's value. Michael Saylor has suggested that if Wall Street allocated 10% of its reserves to Bitcoin, the market cap could reach $20 trillion, pushing Bitcoin's price to $1 million. However, institutional involvement remains limited, with less than 5% of Bitcoin ETF assets held by long-term institutional investors. Retail investors currently dominate the Bitcoin ETF market.Global adoptionReaching $1 million per Bitcoin requires widespread global adoption, with experts estimating that 20%-40% of the world's population (1.6 billion-3.2 billion people) would need to adopt Bitcoin. This requires advancements in infrastructure, education and regulatory support.Continued regulatory supportClear and supportive regulation is crucial for Bitcoin's growth. A unified approach would reduce uncertainty and foster investment. Efforts like the GENIUS Act and the Clarity Act in 2025 have set clearer guidelines for digital assets, boosting institutional confidence and paving the way for broader adoption.Continued technological developmentThe continued development of solutions like the Lightning Network, which improves transaction speed and lowers fees, is essential for scaling Bitcoin, even as a store of value.

 If Bitcoin really does reach $1 million, who will the winners and losers be? Hint: It smells a bit like a pyramid scheme. Winners: Early adoptersIf Bitcoin reaches $1 million, the value of holdings across the network will soar. As of 2025, approximately 900,000 addresses hold at least 1 BTC, while around 4% of the global population owns some amount of Bitcoin. The majority of Bitcoin, however, is controlled by a small group of wealthy individuals and institutions.Strategy, for example, would be a major winner. If Bitcoin hits $1 million, Strategy's current Bitcoin holdings would be worth over $600 billion.Early retail investors who acquired Bitcoin at prices as low as $0.01-$1 would see exponential returns. Someone who bought Bitcoin for a few cents could see their holdings grow into a multimillion-dollar asset.Did you know? Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, is believed to hold about 1.1 million BTC, around 5.2% of the total supply. At $1 million per Bitcoin, this would make Satoshi's holdings worth an estimated $1.1 trillion.Losers: LatecomersAs Bitcoin approaches $1 million, the gap between early investors and latecomers could widen, exacerbating global financial inequality. Those who entered the market early stand to gain immensely, while new investors (particularly retail buyers) will face higher entry costs and lower potential for returns. Latecomers may risk significant losses if Bitcoin's price corrects or crashes after reaching its peak. Bitcoin's growth mirrors a pyramid structure, where early participants benefit as fresh capital from new buyers enters at higher prices. However, this reliance on continuous investment to drive growth leaves the system vulnerable.Unlike traditional investments, Bitcoin's value is largely driven by speculation and supply-demand dynamics, without the inherent utility that stocks or real estate provide. As the price rises, newer investors are essentially funding the gains of early adopters. If Bitcoin's price stagnates or falls, those who bought in at inflated prices could suffer significant losses.Did you know? Governments could also be significant losers in a Bitcoin-driven world. With the rise of decentralized cryptocurrencies, they may face reduced demand for fiat currencies and a loss of fiscal control.

Early retail investors who acquired Bitcoin at prices as low as $0.01-$1 would see exponential returns. Someone who bought Bitcoin for a few cents could see their holdings grow into a multimillion-dollar asset.

Did you know? Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, is believed to hold about 1.1 million BTC, around 5.2% of the total supply. At $1 million per Bitcoin, this would make Satoshi's holdings worth an estimated $1.1 trillion.

As Bitcoin approaches $1 million, the gap between early investors and latecomers could widen, exacerbating global financial inequality. 

Those who entered the market early stand to gain immensely, while new investors (particularly retail buyers) will face higher entry costs and lower potential for returns. Latecomers may risk significant losses if Bitcoin's price corrects or crashes after reaching its peak. 

Bitcoin's growth mirrors a pyramid structure, where early participants benefit as fresh capital from new buyers enters at higher prices. However, this reliance on continuous investment to drive growth leaves the system vulnerable.

Unlike traditional investments, Bitcoin's value is largely driven by speculation and supply-demand dynamics, without the inherent utility that stocks or real estate provide. As the price rises, newer investors are essentially funding the gains of early adopters. 

If Bitcoin's price stagnates or falls, those who bought in at inflated prices could suffer significant losses.

Did you know? Governments could also be significant losers in a Bitcoin-driven world. With the rise of decentralized cryptocurrencies, they may face reduced demand for fiat currencies and a loss of fiscal control.

 While Bitcoin's future is promising, it faces existential threats from emerging technologies, particularly quantum computing. Quantum computers have the potential to undermine Bitcoin's cryptographic security, primarily through Shor's algorithm. This could allow quantum computers to efficiently factor large integers and compute discrete logarithms (which are currently infeasible for classical computers), posing a direct threat to Bitcoin's encryption methods.Bitcoin's reliance on elliptic curve cryptography makes it particularly vulnerable to these quantum attacks. In fact, approximately 4 million BTC (roughly 25% of the usable supply) is stored in addresses with exposed public keys, which would be vulnerable to quantum attacks.The potential economic damage from a quantum attack on future Bitcoin holdings could be catastrophic; a successful hack on a widely adopted currency ($1 trillion worth of market cap as of July 21, 2025) has the ability to trigger a global recession. Bitcoin's decentralized nature means there is no central authority to quickly implement fixes or security measures, increasing the risk of widespread economic instability in the event of a quantum attack.However, to protect Bitcoin from these risks, post-quantum cryptography algorithms are being developed. The National Institute of Standards and Technology is working on standardizing these algorithms to secure digital assets against quantum threats. But implementing these new algorithms would require a massive coordinated effort across Bitcoin's entire network. Transitioning to quantum-resistant cryptography would likely take time, with estimates suggesting the transition could require up to 76 days of downtime for the network. While just one of the many concerns outlined today, the quantum threat offers some important food for thought: Even if Bitcoin manages to reach the $1-million mark, can it truly be considered a sure bet?

Bitcoin BTC$118,079.96 rebounded on Friday from its overnight dip below $115,000, back to its familiar range it traded for the past two weeks.

The largest crypto recently changed hands at $117,200, still down 1.2% over the past 24 hours.

Some analysts noted the dip coincided with asset manager Galaxy moving large amount of BTC to exchanges overnight, likely related to the bitcoin whale that sent this month around $9 billion worth of BTC to trading desks. The wallets held BTC since the early years of Bitcoin's history, transferred the assets in after being dormant for more than a decade.

Later on Friday, Galaxy confirmed that it completed the sale of all 80,000 BTC on behalf of a client, touting it as ""one of the largest notional bitcoin transactions in the history of crypto.""

The sale was part of the investor's estate planning strategy, the firm said.

With the selling pressure by the whale now past, some analysts predicted the lows could be in or close.

John Glover, chief investment officer of crypto lender Ledn, said that BTC could put in a local bottom on Friday or over the weekend before continuing its push to new records, according to his Eliot wave analysis.

""Once completed (either today or over the weekend) I expect that we will complete wave iii by rallying to circa $132,000,"" Glover said in a market note.

For a week, at least, spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds outpaced their Bitcoin counterparts.

The nine ETFs tracking ETH generated more than $1.8 billion in net inflows this week, continuing a 16-day positive streak, according to U.K. asset manager Farside Investors, as interest in the second-largest cryptocurrency mushrooms.

The 12 Bitcoin funds added just $70 million in assets over the same period, with three of the five days showing net outflows for the funds. Bitcoin has historically been on top, but this week, Ethereum dominated crypto ETF flows.

""Many [investors] own Bitcoin ETFs and are increasingly interested in diversifying,"" Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, a trade group, told Decrypt. ""Ethereum is the second-largest digital asset, and the only other one available in [spot] ETF format—making it very easy to choose it in one's effort to improve their portfolio's diversification.""

ETH ETFs' spike comes amid a price surge intertwined with the growing popularity of these funds and the rise of Ethereum treasuries. Those trends accelerated as passage of the GENIUS Act stablecoin bill neared. The legislation, which U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law last week, is expected to benefit Ethereum, the dominant platform for stablecoin transactions.


Ethereum was recently trading at about $3,745, down roughly 3% from its seven-month high set earlier this week but up more than 50% over the past month.

""Ethereum has been skyrocketing in price recently, after an extended period of underperformance compared to Bitcoin, and investors are notorious for buying assets after they've gone up in value and selling them after they've fallen—the exact opposite of what you're supposed to do,"" Edelman said.

BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) led this week's charge, adding $1.29 billion in investments. On Wednesday, ETHA became the third-fastest fund in the ETF industry's 32-year history to reach $10 billion in assets under management (AUM)—251 days, according to Bloomberg data. The Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) netted over $380 million in assets and has $2.3 billion in AUM, according to TradingView.

In an interview with Decrypt, Juan Leon, senior investment strategist at ETF issuer Bitwise Asset Management, said that the Ethereum funds' performance this week caps a month of gains relative to BTC ETFs.

""The ETF inflows have been closing the gap to Bitcoin significantly,"" Leon said. ""If you look at the first week in July for the two assets where the difference in market cap is 5x, there was only a 3.5x gap between the inflows. And then the following week it narrowed further. And last week they were almost on par.""

Leon believes that the ETH funds will continue their momentum at least short-term, although he expects investors to return to Bitcoin ETFs in greater numbers in the second half of the year when major ""wirehouse platforms,"" including Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo, begin offering the latter as trading options before ""greenlighting"" ETH ETFs.

""That'll drive renewed flows into Bitcoin ETFs,"" he said. ""So I'm not sure that ETH ETFs flows can continue to outperform Bitcoin's for the remainder of the year. But right now, we seem to be at least in a short-term inflection point, and irrespective of the absolute numbers, from the point of view of how big one asset is in relation to the other, ETH will continue to punch above its weight over the coming weeks and months.""

The legislation, which U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law last week, is expected to benefit Ethereum, the dominant platform for stablecoin transactions.


Ethereum was recently trading at about $3,745, down roughly 3% from its seven-month high set earlier this week but up more than 50% over the past month.

""Ethereum has been skyrocketing in price recently, after an extended period of underperformance compared to Bitcoin, and investors are notorious for buying assets after they've gone up in value and selling them after they've fallen—the exact opposite of what you're supposed to do,"" Edelman said.

BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) led this week's charge, adding $1.29 billion in investments. On Wednesday, ETHA became the third-fastest fund in the ETF industry's 32-year history to reach $10 billion in assets under management (AUM)—251 days, according to Bloomberg data. The Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) netted over $380 million in assets and has $2.3 billion in AUM, according to TradingView.

In an interview with Decrypt, Juan Leon, senior investment strategist at ETF issuer Bitwise Asset Management, said that the Ethereum funds' performance this week caps a month of gains relative to BTC ETFs.

""The ETF inflows have been closing the gap to Bitcoin significantly,"" Leon said. ""If you look at the first week in July for the two assets where the difference in market cap is 5x, there was only a 3.5x gap between the inflows. And then the following week it narrowed further. And last week they were almost on par.""

Leon believes that the ETH funds will continue their momentum at least short-term, although he expects investors to return to Bitcoin ETFs in greater numbers in the second half of the year when major ""wirehouse platforms,"" including Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo, begin offering the latter as trading options before ""greenlighting"" ETH ETFs.

""That'll drive renewed flows into Bitcoin ETFs,"" he said. ""So I'm not sure that ETH ETFs flows can continue to outperform Bitcoin's for the remainder of the year. But right now, we seem to be at least in a short-term inflection point, and irrespective of the absolute numbers, from the point of view of how big one asset is in relation to the other, ETH will continue to punch above its weight over the coming weeks and months.""

Key Points

Not all crypto ETFs are created equal. One fund is pulling away from the pack with massive inflows and top-notch institutional backing.

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on the real-time price of Ethereum (ETH 0.80%) have been around for a year now. Since the funds were approved and launched in July 2024, Ethereum has gained 7% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.40%) rose 18%. The leading ETFs have done a great job of tracking this performance precisely, even if the cryptocurrency has been lagging behind stocks recently.

But one ETF stands apart from the rest in many ways. If you're planning to enter the Ethereum market via an ETF, the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA -2.82%) should be at the top of your list. Apart from having the most assets under management (AUM) in its category, the iShares ETF also comes with low fees and a proven fund family.

So if you have $500 to spend on a crypto investment today, here's why you should consider the iShares Ethereum Trust.

Ethereum is often more volatile than the larger Bitcoin (BTC 0.40%) cryptocurrency. For instance, the two crypto giants have both posted approximately 1,200% gains in the last five years, but Ethereum's path to this peak had many more peaks and valleys along the way. The S&P 500 is basically flatlining next to both, even in the midst of the generative artificial intelligence boom:

Now, Ethereum serves a very different purpose than Bitcoin. Instead of a fundamental wealth-holding tool, Ethereum's smart contracts help app developers manage financial tools and trends in a global blockchain ledger. So Ethereum's value doesn't spring from a scarce supply, but from real-world usage of the resulting programs.

That makes Ethereum a promising investment if you feel like the financial world could use a whole new set of basic tools. Ethereum-based apps can track ownership of physical assets, execute financial transactions automatically, or manage your digital wallet securely. The Ethereum ledger is readable anytime, from anywhere.

At the same time, its encryption effectively makes all of this transaction data immune to hacking and fraud attacks. On this platform, developers can build a wide variety of financial apps, mobile games, and so on.

So if you see a market for this sort of thing in the long run, Ethereum has led the blockchain-based app development space for years. It's the industry standard -- for good reason. And that should make Ethereum a solid investment over the years, as decentralized app development continues to gain traction.

Buying Ethereum directly often means setting up a new account with a different type of brokerage -- one that can handle cryptocurrency trades rather than stock transactions. You also need to get comfortable with a different type of transaction, where you're usually trading fractions of a digital coin rather than batches of full shares of a stock. Prices are always changing, and you have to figure out where to store your new Ethereum coins.

ETFs make the whole process much easier, assuming you already have a stock-trading brokerage account. These funds act just like stocks, with shares usually priced in a comfortable range. A few iShares Ethereum Trust shares at $27 apiece can be more comfortable than a single Ethereum coin at $3,640.

As mentioned, the iShares fund is more popular and therefore more liquid than other Ethereum-based ETFs. This makes trading safer and easier, with more stable share prices and quicker transactions.

It's part of the world-famous iShares fund family, next to the even more popular iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT -1.88%) and the massive iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV 0.38%). Financial services giant BlackRock runs the show, giving investors the peace of mind that comes with essentially bottomless financial backing.

And like most of its iShares cousins, this one comes with a low fee ratio. At 0.25% per year, it's not exactly the cheapest Ethereum ETF to own, but it comes close to the lowest-cost Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH -2.67%) at 0.15%. The BlackRock backing and world-class liquidity can make up for this small gap, and some Ethereum ETFs come with fee ratios as high as 2.5%.

The iShares Ethereum Trust is only pulling away from the competition, too. With 42% of AUM inflows over the last month, this fund added more AUM than any other Ethereum ETF has done year to date.

You should consider the iShares Ethereum Trust before any other fund in this category. It's a great place to put your next $500 (about 18 shares) of investable cash to work. Market makers broadly agree, judging by the dominant inflows of more funding.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

The cryptocurrency market is undergoing a significant shift as Bitcoin's dominance falls to 60.83%, marking a sharp decline of over 63% from previous levels. This marks the lowest level of BTC dominance in months, driven by institutional investors reallocating capital toward altcoins such as Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Ton. The altcoin market cap has surged past $1.44 trillion, signaling growing confidence in diversified crypto holdings [1]. According to data from Glassnode, Bitcoin is experiencing elevated selling pressure, with large investors (whales and institutions) offloading millions of BTC in mid-July. Daily BTC inflows to exchanges have also increased, reflecting broader capital rotation out of Bitcoin [1].  

Technical indicators further underscore Bitcoin's weakening position. The Altcoin Season Index, a leading metric for altcoin activity, has stabilized near 51, historically signaling the onset of altcoin outperformance. Ethereum, in particular, has seen consecutive price gains, rising over 27% in recent weeks, as demand for decentralized finance (DeFi) and Layer-1 blockchain ecosystems grows [1]. Analysts from Quantum Economics and Bitwise highlight that institutional strategies are increasingly favoring altcoins for higher returns in less saturated markets [1].  

AurealOne (DLUME) and DexBoss (DEBO) have emerged as top altcoin candidates. AurealOne, a Web3 gaming platform, leverages blockchain to introduce a ""skill-to-earn"" model, enabling users to win real crypto rewards based on performance. Its proprietary Aureal Chain emphasizes transparency and fairness, with a planned 2025 launch of over 60 games. The DLUME token is currently priced at $0.0013 [1]. DexBoss, a Solana-based crypto intelligence tool, offers real-time wallet tracking and customizable trade alerts. Its pre-sale aims to raise $50 million across 17 rounds, with the DEBO token at $0.011 [1].  

Other notable altcoins include XRP, which facilitates fast cross-border payments via the XRP Ledger, and Filecoin (FIL), a decentralized storage network underpinning Web3 infrastructure. Cardano (ADA) continues to evolve with its proof-of-stake architecture and layer-2 Hydra protocol, enhancing scalability and energy efficiency [1].  

The broader trend reflects institutional rebalancing of portfolios, with capital flowing into altcoins to capitalize on innovation in DeFi, gaming, and decentralized storage. While Bitcoin remains a key asset, its market capitalization has dipped slightly, amplifying opportunities for high-utility altcoins [1].

Home - Crypto Presales - Top Altcoins to Buy: BlockDAG, PENGU, WLD, and BNB Are Gaining Attention for Real Reasons

Some projects speak about future goals, while others are already working on them. BlockDAG, PENGU, WLD, and BNB are each doing more than talk. BlockDAG is setting up a strong base for major development, PENGU is turning Web3 ideas into a lifestyle brand, WLD is using biometric tools around the world, and BNB powers one of the biggest networks in crypto.







For those reviewing the top altcoins to buy, this group mixes early growth with useful tools. Whether it's tech, identity, or worldwide reach, these names are shaping digital progress.

BlockDAG is becoming a key platform for real use in the blockchain space. With more than 4,500 builders already active and over 300 working projects live, it is moving from plan to action. These include AI tools, DeFi apps, and on-chain products already in motion.

Earlier this year, a global hackathon series with HackerEarth brought in 10,000+ developers and created over 200 dApps. This shows BlockDAG's growing builder interest and real-world focus. The roadmap targets 1,000+ dApps by 2026.

At present, the presale offers BlockDAG coins for $0.0016 until August 11. So far, $353M has been raised, 24.3B coins sold, and more than 18,700 miners delivered. The launch price is set at $0.05, which could mean a 3,025% return from today's rate.







Among the top altcoins to buy, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out for its early traction and builder-first approach. It's not only in the spotlight, it's already being used.

Now priced near $0.0398, PENGU has turned into a strong multimedia brand. Its Pudgy Penguins collection extends from NFTs to animations and products, making it more than just digital content. Its toys are stocked in more than 3,100 Walmart stores, with over 2 million sold globally. That kind of reach gives PENGU a firm spot among the top altcoins to buy, especially for those interested in Web3 culture.







Built on Solana, PENGU uses a supply of 88.8 billion units and includes a licensing feature that benefits users. Holding long-term attention is still a hurdle, but Pudgy World and solid backers continue to take the brand into new areas.

With a current price of about $1.11, WLD is working on a global identity system created by Sam Altman. Over 1,500 Orb devices are now in use across 30+ countries, helping more than 2 million people join through biometric scans.

Its World App is growing and includes zero-knowledge tech to protect user privacy. These features place WLD among the top altcoins to buy as secure ID solutions gain demand. While its long-term supply will grow, emissions stay at 1.5% yearly, with a maximum of 10 billion. Even if regulations slow progress, its adoption rate and strong support make WLD a project with clear forward steps in Web3.

At roughly $758, BNB is the key part of the Binance platform. It powers the BNB Smart Chain, helps run DEX apps, and lets users save on fees and join sales.







BNB also uses a burn system each quarter to lower its supply. Out of a 200 million total, 30% to 35% has already been removed. This deflation strategy helps keep it valuable over time.

BNB is one of the top altcoins to buy because it plays a major role in one of the world's largest blockchain networks. Even with ongoing questions about rules around exchanges, Binance's wide reach helps BNB stay useful and active.

Looking at BlockDAG, PENGU, WLD, and BNB, each project brings something different. From tech and identity to creative branding and network tools, they show what the top altcoins to buy should offer.

BlockDAG remains the one showing real use numbers: more than 4,500 builders, hundreds of working projects, and a goal to reach 1,000+ dApps. Its current price of $0.0016 with a possible 3,025% gain makes now a key time to act before prices rise.







Among the top altcoins to buy, this group stands strong, but BlockDAG may be the most ready for what's ahead as the GLOBAL LAUNCH release nears.

For those analyzing the top cryptocurrencies to buy, this lineup is strong, but BlockDAG might just be the smartest move before launch locks it in.

Fast centralization challenges blockchain's decentralization as users prioritize efficiency over ethos.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

Decentralization was blockchain's founding promise—but in finance, milliseconds move markets. Unless Web3 can match Wall Street's sub-second speed, users will keep choosing the faster rails of traditional finance. We see this in decentralized networks like Ethereum, which processes around 15 transactions per second, compared to Visa's 24,000.

Ever since the internet irrevocably changed finance, the world has never looked back. In fact, speed is an essential component underpinning every facet of how finance operates. It's the difference between closing an arbitrage opportunity or missing out on it altogether, or seeing life-changing funds hit your account right before you miss an important payment.

At the same time, traditional finance is still incredibly opaque, saddled with hidden fees, and designed to keep an elite few at the top while everyone else is locked out entirely. In order for blockchain to truly revolutionize the systems in place today—and to offer users alternatives that are transparent, open, and equitable—the Web3 ecosystem will have to get a whole lot faster.

Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency in existence. This is largely because it was the first one, inspiring the idea of an internet-native system of exchange not tied to any one government or nation. However, despite its international renown, builders still can't ignore that Bitcoin has a 10-minute block time and can handle only 10 transactions per second.

Ethereum marginally improves upon this, but its average of 14 transactions per second is still incredibly slow compared to centralized payment processors. Ethereum transactions can also carry high gas fees, which are a major barrier to widespread adoption. When compared to the NASDAQ, which processes 20,000 stock-market transactions per second on average, it's clear how egregiously blockchain-based systems fall behind.

Additionally, while blockchain's principles of decentralization and trust are important, outside crypto-native circles most people do not care as much about decentralization as they do about performance. Many users prefer centralized systems, like traditional banks or exchanges, because they are faster, cheaper, and much more efficient.

Despite Ethereum's decentralized trust, its slow speed and high costs are a serious drawback. Simply put, the most widely used chains are not even close to competing with traditional offerings. This means users will have to look to faster, more centralized offerings to help close the gap.

Right now, even the most crypto-native circles are starting to sacrifice decentralization for speed. For example, performance-focused chains like Solana, with 400-millisecond block times, support up to 3,000 transactions per second—bringing us closer to traditional offerings. The rise of centralized platforms such as Hyperliquid further bolsters this trend.

In May 2025 alone, Hyperliquid's trading volume surged by 50%, according to DeFiLlama, highlighting the increasing number of traders who are prioritizing speed over a decentralized ethos.

But even with its incredible momentum, Hyperliquid is still not the endgame. It relies too heavily on infrastructure that isn't open or composable, and it serves only a small portion of DeFi traders' needs. The platform lacks the extensibility and interoperability needed to support the transition of modern finance into digital assets on a global scale.

To strike a balance between performance and decentralization, projects can adopt best practices such as batching transactions to reduce on-chain load, using off-chain order books for faster execution, and optimizing state differences to minimize gas costs and latency.

The real killer app for blockchain technology will be a platform that combines decentralization with performance and that's as fast, smooth, and cheap as centralized alternatives like Revolut. Once that happens, there won't be any more conversations about “DeFi vs. TradFi” or “centralization vs. decentralization.”

Instead, we'll simply have a new standard for the financial industry that operates as fast and as seamlessly as the internet itself.

History is unequivocal: the fastest networks become the default. For blockchain, trust alone isn't a moat—latency is. The builders who deliver Web2-grade speed without sacrificing openness will own the next decade of finance.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Revolutionizing Healthcare Payments: The Promise of Blockchain","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/transforming-healthcare-finance-blockchain-technology","Sat, 26 Jul 2025 07:43:47 GMT","

Blockchain technology is not just a buzzword anymore; it's reshaping industries. The healthcare finance sector is no exception. Wellgistics Health's recent move to adopt the XRP Ledger is a case in point, showcasing the potential for blockchain to simplify payments, cut costs, and increase operational efficiency in a field often bogged down by inefficiencies. This post will delve into how blockchain could change the game for healthcare finance, the implications for those in the sector, and the challenges that may arise.

Blockchain is known for being decentralized and immutable, making it a suitable solution for many of the healthcare finance sector's challenges. By offering a secure method for transactions, blockchain has the potential to improve trust among healthcare providers, reduce administrative burdens, and ultimately enhance patient care. As healthcare organizations look to modernize, blockchain is becoming a necessity.

Wellgistics Health is the first Nasdaq-listed company to integrate the XRP Ledger for payment processing. Their goal? To speed up transactions between pharmacies and vendors while also lowering operational costs. CEO Brian Norton sees blockchain as a key to transforming traditional payment methods in healthcare. With a $50 million credit line, they plan to use XRP as both a transactional and reserve asset to modernize their financial operations.

Adopting blockchain for healthcare payments offers many upsides:

But blockchain goes beyond payments; its role in crypto payroll systems is just as significant. By incorporating a crypto payroll platform, healthcare providers can offer employees the option to receive their salaries in cryptocurrency. This caters to the rising demand for digital payment methods and also supports financial inclusion for the unbanked.

Wellgistics' regulatory approval for its strategy is a pivotal moment for blockchain in sensitive sectors like healthcare. This could pave the way for broader adoption across various industries, as demand for speedy and transparent payment systems grows. Historical evidence suggests that institutional adoption often spurs increased activity for related assets, so Wellgistics' proactive use of XRP may usher in significant operational changes.

While the benefits are clear, there are also hurdles to overcome for effective blockchain integration in healthcare finance:

The adoption of blockchain in healthcare finance, as seen with Wellgistics Health's integration of the XRP Ledger, marks a major step toward modernizing the sector. By streamlining payments, enhancing security, and supporting financial inclusion through crypto payroll systems, blockchain could significantly change healthcare finance for the better. However, addressing challenges related to access and expertise will be essential to ensure that all stakeholders benefit. The future of blockchain in healthcare finance is looking brighter, setting the stage for a more efficient and fair system.

ISO 20022 is a global standard for financial messaging that enables structured, consistent communication between financial systems. In blockchain, ISO 20022 acts as a bridge between traditional banking and crypto networks. It helps digital assets fit into established financial workflows.

In this article, you'll learn what ISO 20022 is, why it matters in the world of blockchain, which crypto projects are aligning with it, and what opportunities this creates for developers, institutions, and everyday users.

Let's get into it.

ISO 20022 is a standard for exchanging electronic messages between financial institutions. It was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to allow systems around the world to share rich, structured financial data.

Unlike earlier formats like SWIFT MT, ISO 20022 supports XML and JSON schemas. This allows transactions to include detailed information like sender identity, transaction purpose, regulatory metadata, and more.

The format is already being used by systems like:

Blockchain networks were built outside the traditional finance world. This created a problem: banks, payment rails, and compliance tools couldn't easily interpret blockchain transactions. ISO 20022 helps solve that.

When blockchain platforms adopt ISO 20022 compatibility, they become more suitable for use in regulated environments. This enables:

Instead of treating crypto and fiat as separate ecosystems, ISO 20022 helps unify them.

Blockchains don't natively support ISO 20022. Instead, projects add this support through translation layers or integration protocols. These layers convert blockchain activity into ISO 20022-compliant messages that can be interpreted by banks and financial systems.

This includes:

This type of integration makes it possible for a blockchain-based payment to flow through legacy systems without friction.

Most banks still use older formats like SWIFT MT. These are limited in detail and harder to automate. ISO 20022 is designed to improve on those weaknesses, especially in a digital-first world.

This table helps explain why ISO 20022 is being adopted not only by banks but also by forward-looking blockchain ecosystems.

Several blockchain networks are working toward ISO 20022 compatibility. They do this to improve enterprise adoption and connect better with the global financial system. Some notable projects include:

Now that traditional finance is moving to ISO 20022, blockchain systems with support for this standard can unlock real-world use cases.

These examples show how ISO 20022 opens the door for blockchain to function inside regulated ecosystems.

ISO 20022 is not just a theory. It's being rolled out across the world:

This global migration puts pressure on blockchain networks to align. Without this compatibility, digital assets risk being excluded from the next generation of financial infrastructure.

While the benefits are clear, adopting ISO 20022 is not easy. Here are some roadblocks that blockchain teams face:

Still, most of these challenges can be addressed through middleware, off-chain storage, and selective metadata sharing.

Whether you're a developer, product manager, or financial analyst, now is the time to learn how ISO 20022 intersects with blockchain technology.

You can start with a Blockchain certification that teaches the foundations of how blockchains work in regulated environments.

Asphere, the enterprise division of Ankr, has officially announced the launch of Solana Permissioned Environments (SPEs), a new blockchain solution tailored specifically for enterprise use. On Friday, July 25, Ankr announced it via its official X (previously Twitter) account. This will be a significant milestone in the mainstreaming of blockchain technology in regulated sectors, as it provides fully configurable, high-performance networks deployed on the Solana blockchain.

Solana Permissioned Environments will help meet the increasing demand of businesses needing secure, scalable, and custom blockchain platforms. Asphere describes SPEs as custom blockchain networks on which enterprises can operate fully in their infrastructure and reap the benefits of Solana's performance and speed. Such environments give assurance to companies that want regulatory compliance, data privacy, and sovereignty of operations.

SPEs have multiple benefits, as they are developed in close cooperation with the Solana ecosystem. Solana boasts high transaction throughput and developer-friendly tools, which are advantageous to both developers and enterprise users. Nevertheless, as opposed to classic public blockchains, SPEs allow organizations to have control over their governance, network guidelines, validator configurations, and compliance systems. This distinctive blend renders the SPEs quite useful in the finance, gaming, healthcare, and digital media industries.

Use cases-wise, SPEs are best suited to permissioned financial networks with custom validator settings, closed execution environments, and transaction-free gas. Moreover, the product enables high-throughput decentralized apps, such as those in the gaming, social platform, and content sharing industries. SPEs are also compliance-sensitive applications and provide regulatory tooling and local infrastructure to satisfy the jurisdiction.

The key features of the SPE model include customizable network topology, support for Solana-native developer tools such as Solang and state compression, and flexible governance mechanisms. Block times, token economics, and validator logic can be customized according to enterprise business models. Besides, the enterprise compliance suite of Asphere provides integrated custody of digital assets, know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, and risk mitigation.

Asphere is the expert branch of Ankr that provides secure and scalable infrastructure to institutions and businesses. The firm aims to fill the technological divide between the established Web2 frameworks and the emerging Web3 environment. Asphere strives to enable organizations to embrace blockchain by providing products that ensure reliability, performance, and security.

Asphere relies on security as a stalwart of its services. The company was recently crowned SOC 2 certified, which shows that it has audited, secure systems. This certification means that Asphere adheres to industrial best practices in data protection, incident response, system reliability, and vendor risk management. Instead of being an occasional result, SOC 2 compliance is an action of continuous evaluation and development.

Asphere is currently completing the SOC 2 Type 2 audit to strengthen its security standards. As a result, clients and stakeholders can expect regular updates. Furthermore, the company is committed to maintaining transparency and managing system integrity and risks effectively.

Solana Permissioned Environments launch marks a significant step in the adoption of enterprise blockchain. The new service combines Solana's technical abilities and Asphere Enterprise's expertise. Further, this allows businesses worldwide to have a trustworthy, compliant, and future-ready blockchain infrastructure.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

The Pudgy Penguins NFT-linked token, PENGU, has experienced a significant price surge amid renewed optimism in the NFT market and strategic collaborations expanding the project's real-world utility. Over the past 30 days, PENGU has surged 273.6%, climbing nearly 20% in a single 24-hour period as investors rotate into high-profile digital collectibles [1]. The token has broken through key Fibonacci resistance levels and exited a long-term accumulation range ($0.006–$0.021), forming a classic bullish trend with higher highs and higher lows [2]. Technical indicators, including a positive MACD flip and a strong Relative Strength Index (RSI), suggest continued upward momentum, though some analysts caution that RSI readings near overbought territory could precede a temporary cooldown [1].  

The price rally has been amplified by strategic partnerships and brand expansion. A collaboration with Lufthansa integrated Pudgy Penguins into the airline's loyalty program, while tie-ins with NASCAR have increased exposure at major racing events. Additionally, a deal with Suplay Inc. has opened access to China's multibillion-dollar collectibles market, enhancing the token's perceived utility beyond crypto [1]. These moves position Pudgy Penguins as a crossover brand rather than a niche digital asset, with its social gaming initiative, Pudgy Party, anticipated to further drive engagement.  

Whale activity has also played a role in the recent surge, with large holders driving a 17% price increase in a single day as PENGU approached its all-time high of $0.045 [4]. Analysts have drawn comparisons to PEPE's historic breakout, projecting a potential $0.24 price target for PENGU if the trajectory aligns [5]. However, this remains speculative, as the token currently trades at $0.0386, testing the $0.035–$0.0317 support zone. A successful rebound could push the token toward $0.043–$0.046, with extension levels of $0.075 or $0.097 possible if momentum builds [3].  

Retail investor enthusiasm has further fueled the rally, with PENGU's price climbing 14.3% in 24 hours and weekly gains nearing 40% amid broader meme coin speculation [8]. A spike in demand was also observed following Walmart's toy-related marketing initiatives, which linked to PENGU assets [9]. Longer-term projections, such as an average price of $0.87 by 2028, hinge on broader market conditions and adoption of NFT-related tokens [7].  

Despite the bullish outlook, risks persist. If PENGU fails to hold above critical support levels, it could retreat toward $0.023, a prior Fibonacci level. Analysts emphasize that sustained volume during key price tests will be crucial—without continued buying pressure, the rally may stall [3].  

The PENGU surge reflects a broader trend of NFT-powered tokens gaining traction during altseason, but its success in maintaining momentum will depend on balancing growth with valuation sustainability.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","NFT Market Cap Rises 21%","https://www.blockchain-council.org/cryptocurrency/nft-market-cap-rises-21/","Sat, 26 Jul 2025 11:40:03 GMT","

The NFT market has suddenly bounced back, with its total market cap rising by 21% in just 24 hours. This surge took the overall value from around $5.1 billion to more than $6.3 billion. The spike isn't just about numbers—it signals a potential shift in investor confidence, user activity, and the direction of the digital collectibles market. If you're tracking NFTs, this is a moment to pay attention.

In this article, we break down the reasons behind this sharp rise, explore which collections led the charge, and look at what might come next.

One of the most talked-about moves came from a single wallet that purchased 45 CryptoPunks using 2,082 ETH, worth nearly $6 million. This sparked renewed interest across blue-chip NFT collections, leading to major floor price gains across the board.

Ethereum's strong rally also played a key role. Since most NFTs are still traded on Ethereum, a positive ETH trend often supports NFT prices. Nine out of the top ten collections by trading volume remain Ethereum-based.

After a long lull, investors and traders are revisiting NFTs. The current momentum feels different from past hype cycles. This rally is being driven more by larger wallets and fewer retail flippers, pointing to long-term bets rather than quick profits.

CryptoPunks saw a floor price increase of about 16%, reaching roughly 47.5 ETH or $175,000. This collection was the biggest gainer in absolute volume, largely driven by the whale movement mentioned earlier.

Pudgy Penguins rose about 15% in value, with an increase in unique holders. Floor prices hit 16.6 ETH, or around $62,000. This collection also attracted significant social media attention, which helped boost momentum.

Moonbirds had the biggest percentage gain, jumping 31% in floor value within the same time window. Infinex Patrons went up 9.4%, while niche collections like “You The Real MVP” surged over 1,200%, showing that speculative plays are still alive.

The 21% increase in market cap came alongside a major spike in trading volume. Daily trading volumes rose over 300%, from around $9 million to nearly $39 million. This surge wasn't just confined to Ethereum, though ETH collections did dominate.

There's no guarantee this momentum will hold, but some trends point toward a more stable and long-term cycle. The market's current behavior shows signs of organic growth rather than a coordinated pump. Collections with established brands or community presence are benefiting most.

Also, NFT infrastructure is improving. Projects are releasing better marketplaces, token utilities, and DeFi integrations. These changes support stronger fundamentals compared to the 2021 hype cycle.

If current trends continue, we could see:

Market watchers are also monitoring macro conditions. Crypto regulation, Ethereum gas fees, and general investor sentiment will influence what happens next.

This rally has sparked new interest in NFT education. Whether you're looking to start a career or build a business, upskilling in blockchain, data, and marketing is a smart move.

You can explore a Crypto certification to understand wallet setups, marketplaces, and NFT protocols.

If you want to analyze floor prices, trading patterns, or volume shifts, a Data Science Certification can teach you how to interpret the numbers.

For brand building, NFT campaigns, or creator monetization, a Marketing and Business Certification will show you how to grow and manage NFT-based ventures.

Those interested in the underlying infrastructure and validation processes of crypto assets can also explore Bitcoin mining certification to better understand how NFTs and coins are secured on the blockchain.

The 21% spike in NFT market cap is more than just a number. It signals renewed interest, stronger infrastructure, and a shift toward quality collections. While speculation still plays a role, the focus now seems to be shifting to long-term value and user experience.

For creators, investors, and developers, this is a good time to observe, learn, and prepare for what may be the start of a new phase in the NFT space.

In July, the market capitalization of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) reached an unexpected peak of $6.6 billion, a dramatic surge of 94% compared to the previous month. This rebound is no accident. It is indeed driven by iconic figures of Web3 like CryptoPunks, and a new wave of speculative and cultural interest.

In May, NFTs seemed stuck in a downward spiral, showing a worrying decline. But contrary to all expectations, June marks a spectacular turnaround. This is driven by a market dynamic that defies the most cautious predictions.

DappRadar, one of the most reliable barometers of the crypto ecosystem, notes a weekly increase of 51% in transaction volumes, peaking at $136 million. Indeed, this is a record since February.

This resurgence contrasts with a bearish trend that had persisted for over a year. Indeed, trading volumes had been declining quarter after quarter. This turnaround suggests a deeper dynamic than a simple technical rebound: NFTs may not be dead, but truly evolving.

The public, now more demanding, seems to favor collections with strong symbolism or real utility. This is where Ethereum comes into play with the majority of the highest-valued NFT collections, notably CryptoPunks, Pudgy Penguins, and CryptoBatz.

Its robustness, liquidity, and reputation give Ethereum-based projects a decisive advantage in the race for capitalization.

Crypto, in all its volatility, loves spectacular rebirths. And NFTs seem to offer a worthy representation of this.

Among the spearheads of this resurgence, CryptoPunks stand out. Their floor price jumped 53%. It reached nearly $180,000 per unit, or 47.5 ETH. More than just a pixel collection, the Punks have become a marker of membership in the Web3 elite. As Sara Gherghelas of DappRadar points out:

For some, owning a Punk is simply a matter of status. And right now, that status is trendy.

The purchase of Punk #5577, a Cowboy Ape, for $5.15 million in preferred shares by GameSquare Holdings illustrates how these NFTs can serve as a strategic lever. This piece, originally acquired for $454 in 2017, had already reached $7.7 million in 2022.

Meanwhile, Pudgy Penguins, with their wholesome aesthetic, temporarily dethroned the Punks in weekly volume. They surpassed $20 million in transactions. A performance illustrating the diversity of tastes within the crypto audience.

Even more surprising: the surge of CryptoBatz, following the announcement of Ozzy Osbourne's death. Within a few hours, sales of these NFTs with a dark aesthetic jumped 400%.

Ethereum continues to dominate the technical infrastructure and cultural legitimacy of the market. Indeed, NFT sales on Ethereum explode beyond $100 million. As such, NFTs are no longer mere JPEGs. They become vectors of reputation, storytelling, and innovation within the crypto ecosystem.

Wyoming isn't far from becoming the first U.S. state to issue its own stablecoin, moving closer to a potential showdown with Washington over how its dollar-pegged token should comply with certain restrictions signed into law last week after passage of the GENIUS Act.

The Cowboy State, which is historically suspicious of the federal government, could push back against requests to seize or freeze funds on-chain, people close to the introduction of the Wyoming Stable Token (WYST) told Decrypt, speaking as individuals.

The landmark bill requires financial institutions to issue stablecoins with “procedures to block, freeze, and reject specific or impermissible transactions,” but as a state-issued token, they say some rules may not apply to WYST, including restrictions on offering a yield.

“We are confident that we can issue yield on our stable token,” Wyoming Democratic State Senator Chris Rothfuss, who chairs the state's Select Committee on Blockchain, Financial Technology, and Digital Innovation Technology, told Decrypt. “We haven't necessarily decided that we will [enable WYST yield], but there's a lot of favorability towards it.”

The feature won't be enabled when WYST debuts later this year, but it is being implemented, Rothfuss said, noting that there are still logistical questions that lawmakers are working through. The project's main goal is to use funds generated to fund Wyoming's school system.

Rothfuss said that Wyoming lawmakers are considering other elements of the GENIUS Act, a comprehensive framework for regulating stablecoins that's expected to unlock additional participation, and competition, within the $280 billion industry dominated by Circle and Tether. 

Although the bill has been portrayed by some spectators as a stamp of approval for the crypto industry's legitimacy, some lawmakers fear that the legislation could ultimately erode Americans' financial sovereignty, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA).

“This bill regulates stablecoins and provides for the backdoor Centralized Bank Digital Currency,” she said on X last week. “This will open the door to move you to a cashless society and into digital currency that can be weaponized against you by an authoritarian government.”

CBDCs are centralized, digital versions of fiat money. Although they are similar to stablecoins, they are not issued by private companies on public networks, prompting concerns among some lawmakers, including House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN).

In March, Emmer told Decrypt that the Wyoming Stable Token amounts to a state-backed CBDC. Anthony Apollo, executive director of Wyoming's Stable Token Commission, responded by saying that WYST is an entirely different type of product. He noted, for example, that WYST is backed by U.S. Treasuries, while a government could mint a CBDC out of thin air.

In a recent interview with Decrypt, Apollo said the Commission has “the same concerns that any issuer will have about the potential nefarious use,” and it is trying to onboard blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis to monitor for illicit activity, alongside open-source intelligence firm Inca Digital.

Still, Wyoming's Select Committee on Blockchain wrote in a letter earlier this month that the Commission must “resist pressure to act as a political or financial gatekeeper,” considering “heightened standards” imposed by the United States and Wyoming Constitutions.

Apollo underscored the Commission's obligation to uphold constitutional protections as a distinct driver for WYST compared to hundreds of other stablecoins.

“We have a big delta from incumbents, who could just change their policies and say, ‘We can freeze your assets if you are trying to buy firearms,'” he said. “We have to have freeze and seize capabilities, but we can't activate those capabilities unless we have a valid court order.”

That sentiment was echoed by Rothfuss, who noted that Wyoming's ability to navigate federal requests in a nuanced way has long been viewed by the state's lawmakers as a positive.

“We are not faced with the same obligation to comply with a federal request that a corporation would be faced with,” he said. “We have sovereignty, so when the government is in opposition, [...] they can't just send us a cease and desist letter and start arresting people.”

U.S. President Donald Trump, after skewering the notion of a digital dollar on the campaign trail, signed an executive order earlier this year prohibiting federal agencies from working on CBDCs. That was despite repeated affirmations from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that the U.S. central bank isn't interested in issuing one for everyday payments.

As presidential hopefuls, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also railed against the potential dangers of CBDCs. DeSantis specifically highlighted consumer goods like red meat or gasoline.

Historically, the Cowboy State has had a complicated relationship with Washington, given that the federal government owns 48% of the state's surface land. That has led to conflicts over resources and what some Wyomingites describe as a “tall fence.”

WYST is currently undergoing a pilot program, but the token is expected to debut in August at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium, on at least one network. Current candidates include Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche, among eight other networks.

Wyoming is currently testing WYST's ability to facilitate real-time payments to government contractors using an Avalanche-based protocol developed by blockchain startup Hashfire. Hasfire CEO John Belitsky, who also serves as a subject matter advisor to the Commission, told Decrypt that other states may eventually join Wyoming, but its philosophy cannot be copied.

“Wyoming is a constitution-loving [and] legally un-opinionated state,” he said. “Other states can [launch their own tokens], but are they going to corporate with overreaching federal agencies?”

Fastex, a Dubai-based cryptocurrency exchange, has launched a series of collectible currency notes backed 1:1 by its native token FTN, marking what it claims is the first instance of an exchange issuing such physical-digital hybrid assets [1]. The initiative, developed over a year, combines banknote-grade anti-counterfeit features—such as serial numbers, intaglio ink, optically variable ink, and metallic security foil—with blockchain-based verification. Each note is redeemable for its full value in FTN tokens on the Fastex platform and includes an NFT that users can use to verify authenticity and access exclusive benefits like early product access, airdrops, and event invitations [1].  

The notes, designed with themes inspired by the Solar System, are produced in collaboration with Authentix, a company with over 25 years of experience in anti-counterfeit solutions. Authentix's involvement underscores the project's focus on security and authenticity, as highlighted by Joe Galloso, the firm's International Sales Director, who described the collaboration as a fusion of traditional banknote printing techniques and blockchain innovation [1]. Vakhtang Abrahamyan, Fastex's CEO, emphasized that the initiative reflects the evolution of currency, merging the tangible appeal of collectibles with the transparency and trust of blockchain technology [1].  

The notes will be available for purchase starting July 1 via Yo Cash, a platform managed by Fastex and Authentix. Users must complete a KYC (Know Your Customer) verification process before acquiring the notes, which are backed by FTN tokens and redeemable at any time. Upon redemption, the associated NFTs are burned, ensuring a one-to-one peg with the token. The initiative also aims to enhance user engagement by offering holders additional perks, including early access to new products and participation in airdrops [1].  

Fastex, which positions itself as a secure and accessible trading platform, has previously introduced services like the Bahamut EVM-based blockchain solution and the YoWallet. The exchange's leadership includes former traditional finance professionals, such as a former Deputy Chairman of a Central Bank, reflecting its strategy of bridging conventional and digital financial systems [1]. Authentix, a key partner in the project, specializes in supply chain authentication and has a 320-year collective expertise in banknote security printing, according to the company's profile [1].  

The launch of the FTN-backed notes is part of Fastex's broader strategy to innovate within the Web3 economy, leveraging physical collectibles to drive adoption of digital assets. The initiative has been promoted through interviews with Abrahamyan and Galloso, featured on platforms like Cointelegraph and News.Bitcoin.com [1].

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

BlockDAG, ONDO, PENGU, and TAO have emerged as focal points in the cryptocurrency market, each leveraging distinct strategies to capture investor interest amid evolving industry trends. These projects, highlighted for their technological innovation, cultural resonance, and real-world utility, are reshaping perceptions of what drives success in the crypto space.  

BlockDAG (BDAG) is generating momentum through its DAG-based Layer 1 blockchain, designed to address scalability and speed challenges in traditional blockchains. With over 4,500 developers building 300+ decentralized applications (dApps) across DeFi and AI sectors, the project aims to expand to 1,000 apps by 2026. A partnership with HackerEarth underscores its developer-centric approach. The ecosystem also includes the X1 mobile app and X10 hardware miner, which increased daily BDAG output tenfold in a recent demo. Over 2 million users already engage with the X1 app, while the X10 miner begins shipping on August 15 [1]. The presale raised $353 million, with 24.3 billion BDAG sold at $0.0016. Analysts project the token could reach $1 post-launch and $5 in the future, though these figures remain speculative [1].  

Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) has transitioned from a meme-based NFT project to a global brand with tangible expansions. The token, priced low, benefits from partnerships with NASCAR and Sotheby's, as well as physical toy sales. Its social media engagement exceeds billions, and a recent ETF filing positions it to outperform other meme projects. The project's growing Asia presence and blend of “playful energy” with business strategies solidify its appeal in the best crypto coins list [1].  

Bittensor (TAO) merges AI and blockchain by creating a decentralized network for machine learning models. Unlike speculative AI-linked projects, Bittensor already demonstrates real earnings and developer activity. Its limited token supply adds scarcity, but the project's strength lies in its ability to tokenize AI computations. As decentralized AI gains traction in 2025, TAO's role in this space is seen as pivotal, combining blockchain's transparency with AI's scalability [1].  

Ondo (ONDO) focuses on tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), converting income from real estate and treasury-backed assets into token buybacks. This model attracts institutional investors seeking crypto exposure with lower volatility compared to speculative assets. As Ethereum faces congestion, Ondo's RWA-focused approach offers an alternative for long-term value creation. The project's structured buyback mechanism and partnerships with traditional financial players position it as a bridge between on-chain and off-chain markets [1].  

While all four projects show promise, BlockDAG stands out for its active ecosystem and early traction. The project's working tools, developer partnerships, and presale performance suggest it is already scaling rather than merely preparing to do so. Pudgy Penguins' brand growth, Bittensor's AI integration, and Ondo's RWA model each carve unique niches, but BlockDAG's operational momentum makes it a standout in the 2025 crypto landscape [1].

Welcome back to Tech Pulse — HousingWire‘s weekly series rounding up the latest in technology news, including tools, integrations and trends that impact mortgage and real estate.

Here's what happened this week:

Five Senate Democrats are urging caution as the Federal Housing Finance Agency considers allowing unconverted cryptocurrency in mortgage underwriting. Citing volatility, security and ethical concerns, the lawmakers warn such a move could destabilize housing markets. Pushback follows FHFA Director Bill Pulte's social media remarks signaling openness to crypto-backed mortgage assets.

The real estate portal space may look static, but behind the scenes, mergers like Rocket's acquisition of Redfin are shaking up the status quo. As Rocket, Zillow and others race to build end-to-end housing ecosystems, analysts warn the landscape is evolving fast — and the next big move could be imminent.

Opendoor is betting on a new product, Cash Plus, to reignite seller interest amid a frozen housing market. The offering gives homeowners quick cash upfront with potential for more after sale. Launched alongside agent tools and program expansions, it arrives as Opendoor battles financial strain — and sudden meme-stock fame.

InGenius has acquired recruitment platform SIMPL to supercharge mortgage hiring efforts. Now integrated into InGenius 2.0, SIMPL streamlines recruiting with smart workflows, automation and built-in resources tailored for producing branch managers. The move aims to solve a key industry pain point: scaling teams without disrupting daily production.

RealMLS has partnered with Rayse to offer all members free access to the transparency-focused real estate platform. Now featuring seller tools, Rayse helps agents showcase their work throughout a transaction — a timely move amid shifting industry norms post-commission lawsuits. Early adopters are eligible to win Jacksonville Jaguars tickets.

Northwest Multiple Listing Service (NWMLS) has launched “Finding Homes,” a bilingual, voice-activated home search tool accessible via Amazon‘s Alexa. Built with inclusivity in mind, it supports English and Spanish queries and aids users with disabilities. Developed with Lundy Inc. and Able Environments, the platform transforms home searches into natural conversations.

LeadingRE has added Final Offer to its Solutions Group, expanding its tech offerings for 550-plus global real estate firms. Final Offer brings real-time offer transparency to both on- and pre-market listings, helping agents communicate seller terms clearly and keep buyers informed. The platform aims to modernize negotiations while reinforcing agent value and consumer trust.

Real estate tech startup Further has launched a new AI-powered homebuying platform featuring Homebuyer AI, a virtual assistant designed to guide users through every step of purchasing a home. The assistant evolves with each user, offering smarter, more tailored advice over time.

Rechat has officially launched Lucy, an AI-powered agent assistant designed to streamline daily operations for real estate professionals. Integrated into Rechat's all-in-one platform, Lucy supports client communication, marketing, and transaction management. 

MoxiWorks has named Dave Greenbaum as its first chief customer officer. He will drive support, retention and satisfaction as the company continues evolving its platform and customer experience strategy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","AI-fueled crypto scams are booming, up 456% — and no one is safe, expert warns","https://nypost.com/2025/07/26/tech/ai-fueled-crypto-scams-surging-in-nyc-and-beyond-expert-warns/","Sat, 26 Jul 2025 17:27:00 GMT","

Crypto crooks are getting bolder — and now, they sound just like your mom.

Global crypto scams soared 456% between May 2024 and April 2025 — becoming increasingly reliant on AI-generated voices, deepfake videos and phony credentials to fleece unsuspecting victims, blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs‘ Ari Redbord told The Post after testifying before Congress last Tuesday.

“These scams are highly effective, as the technology feels incredibly real and familiar to the victim,” Redbord said.

“We've seen cases where scammers use AI to replicate the voice of a loved one, tricking the victim into transferring money under the guise of an urgent request.”

And the threat is exploding — especially in high-density cities like New York, Miami and Los Angeles, he added.

In June, New York officials froze $300,000 in stolen cryptocurrency and seized more than 100 scam websites linked to a Vietnam-based ring that targeted Russian-speaking Brooklynites with fake Facebook investment ads.

Meta shut down over 700 Facebook accounts tied to the scam. 

Investigators say the group used deepfake BitLicense certificates and moved victims onto encrypted apps like Telegram before draining their wallets.

Some New Yorkers lost hundreds of thousands of dollars — and it's not just everyday joes getting targeted. 

Even crypto insiders are falling for it. Florida-based crypto firm MoonPay saw its CEO Ivan Soto-Wright and CFO Mouna Ammari Siala duped into wiring $250,000 in crypto to a scammer posing as Trump inauguration co-chair Steve Witkoff, according to a recent Department of Justice complaint.

And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

Globally, fraudsters swiped more than $10.7 billion in 2024 through crypto cons — including romance scams, fake trading platforms and “pig-butchering,” where scammers build fake relationships before draining victims' accounts, Redbord said. 

In the US, Americans filed nearly 150,000 crypto-related fraud complaints in 2024, with losses topping $3.9 billion, according to the FBI. But the real number is likely much higher.

“Only around 15% of victims actually report these crimes,” Redbord said, citing shame, fear and distrust in law enforcement — particularly among older adults and immigrant communities.

One of these scammers go-to tools? Crypto ATMs — especially those tucked inside New York delis and convenience stores. 

Illicit use at these kiosks is more than twice as high as in the broader crypto market, Redbord said. Victims are often directed to scan a QR code and deposit cash, instantly converting it to crypto before the funds disappear.

As the scams rage on, Washington is starting to bring order to the Wild West of crypto.

House lawmakers wrapped up “Crypto Week” last Thursday by passing the first-ever comprehensive cryptocurrency legislation — a trio of bills focused on regulating stablecoins, trading platforms and digital asset infrastructure.

Even so, Redbord advised, common sense is the best defense.

“If something feels too good to be true — especially unsolicited investment advice — it almost always is,” he said. 

“Verify the platform. Confirm identities. And when in doubt, report it — whether to IC3, Chainabuse or your local authorities.”

                    CoinDCX faced accusations of a 17-hour-long delay when it came to updating customers about the breach [File]
                                          | Photo Credit: REUTERS
                                      

The story so far: On July 19, the crypto exchange CoinDCX updated users that one of its internal accounts had been “compromised.” The company's executives reassured panicked investors and traders that their assets were safe and that access to their crypto would not be cut off. 

Despite assurances, many CoinDCX customers moved to withdraw their assets, perceiving the event could turn into something like the WazirX hack last year. 

CoinDCX is a Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) registered Indian cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2018 by Neeraj Khandelwal and Sumit Gupta, now counting over 1.6 crore registered users. On July 19, the exchange shared that one of its “internal operational accounts, used solely for liquidity provisioning on a partner exchange, was compromised due to a sophisticated server breach.” Mr. Khandelwal clarified this involved unauthorised access to an operational hot (virtually connected) wallet on a partner exchange.

CoinDCX reported financial exposure of about $44 million but stressed that the incident was contained by isolating the affected account, which was segregated from the company's customer wallets. The exchange further added that the exposure was limited to that amount alone and that it would be fully absorbed by CoinDCX through its own reserves.

“The incident has been formally reported to CERT-In, and we are actively working with leading blockchain forensics firms and ecosystem partners to trace the attacker and recover assets,” said CoinDCX in its Incident Report, and provided information about the cross-chain movement of the stolen assets.

The company also announced a recovery bounty programme.

CoinDCX repeatedly stressed that customers' funds were secure and unaffected by the hack, as they were placed in segregated, cold wallets that are challenging for attackers to breach. The company also stated that trading, rupee deposits, and rupee withdrawals remained fully functional throughout the period. However, some customers complained that their withdrawal requests took time to be processed, sparking fears that their funds had been frozen. 

CoinDCX's founding partner Mridul Gupta said that “operational challenges caused by high withdrawal volumes during non-banking hours” had led to some delays but denied allegations of a freeze. The company later confirmed that all withdrawal requests had been successfully processed. While crypto withdrawals are not possible for everyone using CoinDCX, this is a pre-existing situation that is part of the company's risk policy and was not caused by the hack itself.

Furthermore, the exchange faced accusations of a 17-hour-long delay when it came to updating customers about the hack. CoinDCX defended its actions and said it needed to have all the information before issuing a statement to customers but said investigating agencies were immediately informed and onboarded.

“Our first priority is always to act, not just to speak. Before making a public statement, we had to ensure the threat was fully contained, our platform was secure, and all customer funds were safe. Communicating with incomplete or unverified information would have been irresponsible and could have caused unnecessary panic,” said co-founder Sumit Gupta.

Other CoinDCX users raised complaints about temporary price drops for certain assets, as well as some tokens being under maintenance, which the company also addressed.

Just a little over a year ago, on July 18, 2024, WazirX was targeted by North Korean cyber-thieves. That day, a multi-signature wallet that the WazirX exchange was managing with the company Liminal was exploited, leading to the loss of assets worth over $230 million. This was far greater than the losses reported by CoinDCX; WazirX customers' assets were directly affected by this breach.

After much delay and confusion, WazirX blocked users' access to their crypto for an indefinite period of time and acknowledged significant losses. By contrast, CoinDCX has stressed that it is business as usual for the exchange, noting on X that its annual revenue exceeds ₹1,100 crores.

WazirX customers demanded that the company use its own profits or funds to cover losses, but the company said this was not possible, citing an ownership dispute with the international crypto exchange Binance. WazirX further decided to carry out its legal restructuring exercise in Singapore.

WazirX users have not been able to access their locked up crypto for over a year and are set to vote for a second time on the amended Scheme of Arrangement. This comes after the first proposed restructuring plan was rejected by the Singapore High Court.

Both WazirX and CoinDCX were hit with criticism for delays in informing their customers about their respective hacks.

Investors in India should remember that crypto trading is a largely unregulated activity in the country; even users of centralised, FIU-registered exchanges can expect little to no support from the Indian authorities in case of a crisis such as a security breach.

Satnam Narang, Senior Staff Research Engineer at Tenable, explained that if users want full control of their coins, they should consider self-custody options like an offline, hardware cold wallet they directly control. Even here, due diligence is required in order to buy only trusted hardware wallets from legitimate sellers, according to him.

“As more and more exchanges have been set up across the world, we have seen reports of attacks targeting smart contract flaws or other ways to steal funds from these exchanges including but not limited to social engineering, theft of credentials or private keys or targeting a third-party company that works with the targeted organization,” said Mr. Narang, noting that the CoinDCX hack was one of the largest cryptocurrency breaches since the attack against WazirX last year.

He highlighted that when crypto prices go up, there is also a rise in attacks against both exchanges and customers. Mr. Narang said that traders storing coins on crypto exchanges should use multi-factor authentication and strong passwords, or store their coins securely offline, if possible.

“There is an old adage in the cryptocurrency space that says: “not your keys, not your crypto/coins”. As long as users store their cryptocurrency on an exchange, those coins don't necessarily belong to them because the exchange could ban their account or an exchange hack could lead to the loss of coins,” explained Mr. Narang.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","Analysts See XRP Hitting $4, Solana $250 as ETF Buzz Builds","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/26/analysts-see-xrp-hitting-usd4-solana-usd250-as-etf-buzz-builds","Sat, 26 Jul 2025 05:00:18 GMT","

XRP is regaining investor attention as a wave of ETF-driven optimism and post-lawsuit momentum builds around the token — even amid price turbulence and large-scale liquidations earlier this week.

According to Bitget Wallet CMO Jamie Elkaleh, institutional confidence has improved since Ripple's partial legal win in March, paving the way for futures products like ProShares' UXRP and fueling speculation around a potential spot ETF.

“XRP is regaining market momentum as renewed ETF speculation intersects with increasing legal clarity,” Elkaleh said. “This shift is boosting market depth and signaling a structural step forward for XRP's legitimacy in U.S. markets.”

That narrative helped XRP briefly break above $3.60 before retracing to around $3.09, following $105M in long liquidations and a controversial $175M wallet transfer linked to Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen. Despite the volatility, analysts remain constructive.

“Renewed ETF speculation and legal clarity... are significant catalysts driving XRP toward the $3 mark,” said Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research. “With momentum, $3.50–$4 is plausible in the coming weeks.”

XRP's ETF exposure is currently limited to futures, but analysts say any progress toward a spot product could drive a second wave of inflows — particularly if the SEC maintains its softened posture post-March ruling.

Meanwhile, Solana is also catching a bid on the back of ecosystem growth and ETF chatter. The token now trades near $197, with analysts projecting $200–$250 as the next range if adoption trends continue.

“ETF conversations around SOL are further amplifying interest,” Elkaleh added. “With a more crypto-friendly regulatory tone emerging in the U.S., sentiment around both XRP and SOL remains constructive.”

Both assets face downside risks from macro pullbacks or renewed regulatory friction, but analysts believe fundamentals are finally starting to align with market structure. Liquidity is improving. Institutional flows are growing. And ETF products — even if only futures for now — are creating a bridge that retail and funds alike are beginning to cross.

The next move may depend less on narrative — and more on whether inflows can keep pace with expectations.

Hedera's HBAR token surged nearly 12% on Friday, climbing to $0.2657 and outperforming every other top-20 cryptocurrency by daily percentage gain, according to CoinDesk Data. The rally followed an announcement by popular trading platform Robinhood that it had added support for the asset, increasing its exposure to a broad base of U.S. retail investors.

The listing sent HBAR trading volumes sharply higher, with a mid-day breakout around 12:00 UTC on July 25 pushing prices through the $0.26 mark amid more than 713 million tokens traded in a single hour. That move established the $0.26 zone as near-term resistance, though the token continued to show strong upward momentum into Saturday.

Hedera, unlike traditional blockchains, operates on a unique hashgraph consensus model that allows for high-speed, low-cost transactions at scale. It is designed to support decentralized applications, NFTs, and DeFi, and is widely known for its energy efficiency. The network's native token, HBAR, is used to pay for network services, stake for security, and incentivize node participation.

One analyst believe HBAR could have more room to run. 

On Friday, crypto analyst ChartNerd said on X that HBAR could be setting up for a major move higher — but only if it clears a key technical hurdle. Specifically, he pointed to a resistance level near $0.35, which he said aligns with something called the Supertrend indicator — a commonly used tool that helps traders identify when an asset may switch from a downtrend to an uptrend. 

According to ChartNerd, if HBAR can close above that level with strong momentum, the token could enter what traders call “price discovery” — a  stage where there are no prior highs to act as barriers. He cited Fibonacci extension levels, which are often used to estimate future price targets during strong uptrends, suggesting that HBAR could potentially rise to $1.26 or even $3.30 in a bullish scenario.

Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of the crypto exchange Gemini, claimed that JPMorgan Chase halted its onboarding process for Gemini after he criticized the bank's new fee structure for fintech companies.

Last week, Winklevoss publicly criticized JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon after Bloomberg reported the bank would start charging fintech platforms for access to customer banking data. Many of these platforms serve as bridges between traditional banks and crypto services.

“This will bankrupt fintechs that help you link your bank accounts to crypto companies,” Winklevoss posted on X. “ This is the kind of egregious regulatory capture that kills innovation, hurts the American consumer, and is bad for America.”

JPMorgan didn't address Gemini directly but defended its decision, telling Forbes that nearly 2 billion monthly requests for user data come from third parties, most of them not tied to actual customer activity.

By charging fees, the bank says it aims to curb misuse and protect consumers. In a follow-up tweet, Winklevoss said the bank told Gemini it was pausing re-onboarding the exchange.

JPMorgan had previously offboarded Gemini, as CoinDesk reported, during so-called Operation Choke Point 2.0, a period during which many crypto firms lost banking access under regulatory scrutiny.

“We will continue to call out this anti-competitive, rent-seeking behavior and immoral attempt to bankrupt fintech and crypto companies,” Winklevoss wrote.

Gemini, which filed confidentially for an IPO earlier this month, has been offering an increasing number of services that recently started including tokenized stocks.

Bitcoin BTC$118,099.24 rebounded on Friday from its overnight dip below $115,000, back to its familiar range it traded for the past two weeks.

The largest crypto recently changed hands at $117,200, still down 1.2% over the past 24 hours.

Some analysts noted the dip coincided with asset manager Galaxy moving large amount of BTC to exchanges overnight, likely related to the bitcoin whale that sent this month around $9 billion worth of BTC to trading desks. The wallets held BTC since the early years of Bitcoin's history, transferred the assets in after being dormant for more than a decade.

Later on Friday, Galaxy confirmed that it completed the sale of all 80,000 BTC on behalf of a client, touting it as ""one of the largest notional bitcoin transactions in the history of crypto.""

The sale was part of the investor's estate planning strategy, the firm said.

With the selling pressure by the whale now past, some analysts predicted the lows could be in or close.

John Glover, chief investment officer of crypto lender Ledn, said that BTC could put in a local bottom on Friday or over the weekend before continuing its push to new records, according to his Eliot wave analysis.

""Once completed (either today or over the weekend) I expect that we will complete wave iii by rallying to circa $132,000,"" Glover said in a market note.

 XRP selling pressure could mushroom if the recent 50 billion XRP sale from a wallet linked to Ripple's Chris Larsen was ""just the warm-up."" 

Key points:

Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen sparks warnings to XRP investors after a wallet linked to him sends 50 million tokens to exchanges.

Larsen notionally has over 2.5 billion XRP left, which would create massive selling pressure if distributed.

XRP/USD currently trades 13% below recent all-time highs, failing to recover after the sell-off.

XRP (XRP) investors face new warnings over becoming “exit liquidity” after Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen moved 50 million tokens to exchanges.

In a response on X, J. A. Maartunn, a contributor to onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant, told XRP holders not to “get dumped on.”

XRP hit near all-time highs above $3.60 on July 17, but the achievement was quickly overshadowed by large outflows from a wallet linked to Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen.

As Cointelegraph reported, reactions on social media were mixed, with some seeing a reasonable profit-taking move and others accusing Larsen of deliberate offloading at the highs.

Continuing the topic, Maartunn warned that the wallet's giant XRP stash meant that the recent 50 million XRP outflows were merely a drop in the ocean.

Larsen, he suggested, could increase sell-side pressure by a huge factor should he choose to pull more of its balance.

“Chris Larsen (Ripple co-founder) still holds 2.58B $XRP — that's $8.83B,” he wrote. 

XRP was one of the major altcoins leading the sector's comeback this month after Bitcoin (BTC) began consolidating.

Currently at $3.18, according to Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView, XRP/USD has since corrected 13%.

“Don't get dumped on. Don't be the exit liquidity. Protect yourself,” Maartunn added.

Other popular market participants joined the concerns, including trader ManLy.

Larsen's presumed sales came as Bitcoin itself faced snap downside pressure as a Satoshi-era whale sold 80,000 BTC, which had previously been dormant for 14 years.

 Ether's recent surge in social media dominance signals the potential risk for a price correction, according to Santiment. 

Ether's recent price rally may be due for a cooldown, as a surge in social media mentions — reaching levels of “extreme euphoria” — points to the potential for a near term correction, according to sentiment platform Santiment.

However, other indicators suggest Ether's (ETH) rally may still have room to run, which has gained more than 50% over the past 30 days.

“Social metrics are flashing warning signs. Since early May, Ethereum's price ratio against Bitcoin has surged by an incredible 70%,” Santiment said in a report on Friday.

“This has led to extreme euphoria and a massive spike in social dominance, which is often a red flag,” Santiment added.

The sentiment platform explained that when social dominance of a cryptocurrency spikes to “unusually high levels,” it signals the asset may be overvalued. “It suggests the asset is over-hyped and the trade is becoming crowded, increasing the risk of a price correction,” Santiment explained.

Ether is trading at $3,750 at the time of publication, up 51.84% over the past 30 days, according to Nansen. However, Santiment said it is also possible that the rally is not over just yet for Ether, as other indicators suggest the market hasn't reached “peak frothiness.”

“Social dominance for memecoins is currently quite low,” Santiment said, pointing out that past market tops typically sees the opposite.

“A true marketwide top is often characterized by widespread, irrational speculation, and the absence of that could suggest this rally isn't over,” Santiment said.

Meanwhile, the recent growing corporate interest in Ether — including the recent large purchases from Sharplink Gaming and Bitmine Immersion technologies — could be the catalyst that pushes the asset to new highs, according to santiment analyst Maksim Balashevich.

Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz said on Thursday, “There's not a lot of supply of ETH, and so I think ETH probably has a chance to outperform Bitcoin in the next three to six months.”

Santiment issued a similar warning for Bitcoin (BTC) on Sunday.

Santiment analyst Brian Quinlivan said that nearly half of all crypto-related mentions on social media the previous week had centered around Bitcoin as it hit new highs, a level of dominance that may signal a local top and a potential short-term pullback.

“As Bitcoin's market value crept above $123.1K for the first time in its 17+ year history, there was an equally historic social dominance spike,” Quinlivan said.

 A young and tech-savvy population, combating inflationary pressures, is driving Bitcoin adoption and a new financial system in Pakistan. 

Pakistan's demographics position the country as a major catalyst for Bitcoin (BTC) adoption, allowing it to “leapfrog” developed nations, according to Bilal Bin Saqib, Pakistan's state minister of crypto and blockchain.

“A global policy shift has happened, not just in Pakistan, but all around the world,” Bin Saqib told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview. The government of Pakistan moved to regulate crypto in November 2024.

The country has 40 million crypto wallets and is one of the “top five” countries in terms of crypto adoption, which the minister attributed to Pakistan's young demographic. He told Cointelegraph:

“Emerging markets are what will leapfrog the adoption of these new technologies,” the minister said, with smaller countries more likely to adopt Bitcoin due to their nimble size, allowing them to front-run developed countries. “It's easier to make a speedboat move than the Titanic,” Bin Saqib added.

Pakistan and El Salvador signed a letter of intent in July to share education and knowledge about Bitcoin, digital asset infrastructure, and energy development for crypto mining, the minister said.

“The cooperation is essentially based on how emerging economies that are both under the IMF program can leverage technology and other financial instruments for national growth,” he told Cointelegraph.

Pakistan's National Crypto Council and other regulatory bodies are seeking input on a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets, licensing crypto exchanges, developing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, launching a stablecoin, and mining Bitcoin using excess energy, the minister said.

“Pakistan has a very interesting problem. We have excess electricity, which we pay capacity charges for,” the minister told Cointelegraph. 

He said the country has up to 10,000 megawatts (MW) of excess energy, which is a “liability” due to the carrying costs of the electricity.

Bin Saqib said the country is allocating 2,000 MW for Bitcoin mining and AI data centers. The government is also exploring the potential to mine BTC with runoff energy from methane and other excess or stranded power sources, he added.

Math Puzzle: Slice the Cube and Doughnut

By Martin Gardner 

An engineer noted for his ability to visualize three-dimensional structure was having coffee and doughnuts. Before he dropped a sugar cube into his cup, he placed the cube on the table and thought, “If I pass a horizontal plane through the cube's center, the cross section will, of course, be a square. If I pass it vertically through the center and four corners of the cube, the cross section will be an oblong rectangle. Now suppose I cut the cube this way with the plane.”

To his surprise, his mental image of the cross section was a regular hexagon. How was the slice made? If the cube's side is half an inch, what is the side of the hexagon?

After dropping the cube into his coffee, the engineer turned his attention to a doughnut lying flat on a plate. “If I pass a plane horizontally through the center,” he said to himself, “the cross section will be two concentric circles. If I pass the plane vertically through the center, the section will be two circles separated by the width of the hole. But if I turn the plane so....” He whistled with astonishment. The section consisted of two perfect circles that intersected!

How was this slice made? If the doughnut is a perfect torus, three inches in outside diameter and with a hole one inch across, what are the diameters of the intersecting circles?

A cube cut in half by a plane that passes through the midpoints of six sides, as shown in the illustration below, produces a cross section that is a regular hexagon. If the cube is half an inch on each side, the side of the hexagon is √2⁄4 inch.

Amanda Montañez

(This hexagon, by the way, furnishes the solution to an interesting puzzle by Lewis Carroll that is cited by mathematician Warren Weaver in his article “The Mathematical Manuscripts of Lewis Carroll,” which was published in Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society on October 15, 1954. Can a billiard ball travel inside a cube in such a way that it touches all six sides and continues forever on the same path, all portions of the path being equal? The solution is a path joining the midpoints of the sides of the hexagon.)

To cut a torus so that the cross section consists of two intersecting circles, the plane must pass through the center and be tangent to the torus above and below, as shown in the illustration below. If the torus and hole have diameters of three inches and one inch, respectively, each circle of the section will clearly have a diameter of two inches.

Can we fix it back?

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Water has power. So much power, in fact, that pumping Earth's groundwater can change the planet's tilt and rotation. It can also impact sea-level rise and other consequences of climate change.

Pumping groundwater appears to have a greater consequence than ever previously thought. But now—thanks to a study published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters—we can see that, in less than two decades, Earth has tilted 31.5 inches as a result of pumping groundwater. This equates to .24 inches of sea level rise. 

“Earth's rotational pole actually changes a lot,” Ki-Weon Seo, a geophysicist at Seoul National University and study lead, says in a statement. “Our study shows that among climate-related causes, the redistribution of groundwater actually has the largest impact on the drift of the rotational pole.”

With the Earth moving on a rotational pole, the distribution of water on the planet impacts distribution of mass. “Like adding a tiny bit of weight to a spinning top,” authors say, “the Earth spins a little differently as water is moved around.”

NASA research published in 2016 alerted us to the fact that the distribution of water can change the Earth's rotation. This study in Geophysical Research Letters attempts to add some hard figures to that realization. “I'm very glad to find the unexplained cause of the rotation pole drift,” Seo says. “On the other hand, as a resident of Earth and a father, I'm concerned and surprised to see that pumping groundwater is another source of sea-level rise.”

The study included data from 1993 through 2010, and showed that the pumping of as much as 2,150 gigatons of groundwater has caused a change in the Earth's tilt of roughly 31.5 inches. The pumping is largely for irrigation and human use, with the groundwater eventually relocating to the oceans.

In the study, researchers modeled observed changes in the drift of Earth's rotational pole and the movement of water. Across varying scenarios, the only model that matched the drift was one that included 2,150 gigatons of groundwater distribution.

Surendra Adhikari, a research scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory who was involved in the 2016 study, says the additional research is important. “They've quantified the role of groundwater pumping on polar motion,” he says in a news release, “and it's pretty significant.”

Where the water moves from—and to—matters. Redistributing water from the midlatitudes makes the biggest difference, so our intense water movement from both western North America and northwestern India have played a key role in the tilt changes.

Now that the impact of water movement is known for such a short—and relatively recent—time, digging through historical data may help show trends and provide greater depth to the understanding of groundwater movement effects.

“Observing changes in Earth's rotational pole is useful,” Seo says, “for understanding continent-scale water storage variations.”

This data may also help conservationists understand how to work toward staving off continued sea level rise and other climate issues. Hopefully, changes can be properly implemented over time.

Researchers investigating atomic-scale phenomena impacting next-generation electronic and quantum devices have captured the first microscopy images of atomic thermal vibrations, revealing a new type of motion that could reshape the design of quantum technologies and ultrathin electronics.

Yichao Zhang, an assistant professor in the University of Maryland Department of Materials Science and Engineering, has developed an electron microscopy technique to directly image ""moiré phasons"" -- a physical phenomenon that impacts superconductivity and heat conduction in two-dimensional materials for next-generation electronic and quantum devices. A paper about the research, which documents images of the thermal vibration of individual atoms for the first time, published July 24 in the journal Science. (See video link below.)

Two-dimensional materials, which are sheet-like structures a few nanometers thick, are being explored as new components of next-generation quantum and electronic devices. A feature in twisted two-dimensional materials are ""moiré phasons,"" critical to understanding the materials' thermal conductivity, electronic behavior, and structural order. Previously, moiré phasons were difficult to detect experimentally, preventing further understanding of the materials that could revolutionize quantum technologies and energy-efficient electronics.

Zhang's research team took on this challenge by using a new technique called ""electron ptychography,"" which achieved the highest resolution documented (better than 15 picometer) and detected blurring of individual atoms caused by thermal vibrations. Her work has revealed that spatially localized moiré phasons dominate thermal vibrations of twisted two-dimensional materials, which fundamentally reshaped how scientists understand its impact.

The breakthrough study, which confirmed the longstanding theoretical predictions of moiré phasons, also demonstrated that ""electron ptychography"" can be used to map thermal vibrations with atomic precision for the first time -- which was previously an experimental capability out of reach.

""This is like decoding a hidden language of atomic motion,"" said Zhang. ""Electron ptychography lets us see these subtle vibrations directly. Now we have a powerful new method to explore previously hidden physics, which will accelerate discoveries in two dimensional quantum materials.""

Zhang's research team will next focus on resolving how thermal vibrations are affected by defects and interfaces in quantum and electronic materials. Controlling the thermal vibration behavior of these materials could enable the design of novel devices with tailored thermal, electronic, and optical properties -- paving the way for advances in quantum computing, energy-efficient electronics, and nanoscale sensors.

Snell's law dictates the phenomenon of light refraction at the interface between two media. Here, we demonstrate arbitrary programming of light refraction through an engineered material where the direction of the output wave can be set independently for different directions of the input wave, covering arbitrarily selected permutations of light refraction between the input and output apertures. Formed by a set of cascaded transmissive layers with optimized phase profiles, this refractive function generator (RFG) spans only a few tens of wavelengths in the axial direction. In addition to monochrome RFG designs, we also report wavelength-multiplexed refractive functions, where a distinct refractive function is implemented at each wavelength through the same engineered material volume, i.e., the permutation of light refraction is switched from one desired function to another function by changing the illumination wavelength. As experimental proofs of concept, we demonstrate permutation and negative refractive functions at the terahertz part of the spectrum using 3D-printed materials. Arbitrary programming of refractive functions enables new design capabilities for optical materials, devices and systems.

The study of refraction dates back to ancient times when early philosophers like Ptolemy explored the bending of light as it passed through different media. This bending is dictated by the Snell's law, i.e., \({n}_{{in}}\sin {\theta }_{{in}}={n}_{{out}}\sin {\theta }_{{out}}\), where \({n}_{{in}}\) and \({n}_{{out}}\) are the refractive indices of the two media, and \({\theta }_{{in}}\) and \({\theta }_{{out}}\) refer to the angles that the light rays have with respect to the surface normal, while the azimuthal angles of the incident and refracted rays remain the same, i.e., \({\varphi }_{{in}}={\varphi }_{{out}}\)1,2. Advances in nanotechnology have enabled engineering of artificial materials3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 with negative effective refractive indices12,13,14,15,16,17,18, causing light to bend in unusual ways and giving rise to phenomena such as anomalous refraction12,19,20,21,22,23,24 and perfect lensing25,26,27,28,29. However, the refractive function that relates the direction of the refracted wave \(\left({\theta }_{{out}},{\varphi }_{{out}}\right)\) to the direction of the incident wave \(\left({\theta }_{{in}},{\varphi }_{{in}}\right)\) is a fixed function determined by the refractive indices of the two media, as described by the Snell's law. This behavior arises from the phase-matching condition30 of the wavefronts on both sides of an interface. Recognizing this fact allows the tuning of the refractive function along an interface by introducing a phase-gradient, leading to the generalized Snell's law, \({n}_{{out}}\sin {\theta }_{{out}}-{n}_{{in}}\sin {\theta }_{{in}}=\frac{\lambda }{2\pi }\frac{d\psi }{{dx}}\) where \(\psi\) is the spatial phase distribution at the interface and λ is the wavelength of light31,32,33,34,35. Such a phase-gradient can be implemented by using, e.g., gradient metasurfaces, where the properties of the subwavelength inclusions constituting the meta-atoms vary gradually across a surface36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43. While there are reports of tunable refraction realized by adjusting the optical properties of these engineered materials through external stimuli44,45,46,47,48,49,50, at any given state of these materials, the behavior of light refraction for different input directions remains coupled. This prohibits arbitrary programming of the output wave direction independently for each input direction of light; as a result, arbitrary programming of refractive functions could not be achieved with these earlier designs.

Here we demonstrate arbitrary programming of refractive functions through a passive optical device, which we term refractive function generator (RFG); see Fig. 1. In an RFG, the independently optimizable spatial features, i.e., the discrete phase elements, are distributed at a lateral pitch of ~λ/2 over consecutive transmissive layers, axially spanning only \(\sim \! 15\lambda -50\lambda\). Supervised deep learning51 is used to optimize the collection of these transmissive layers for the implementation of a desired two-dimensional refractive function (\(f\)), where \({\hat{k}}_{{out}}=f({\hat{k}}_{{in}})\) and \({\hat{k}}_{{in}}\), \({\hat{k}}_{{out}}\) define the propagation directions of the input and output waves, respectively. We report RFG designs that can achieve an arbitrary mapping between the directions of the input and output waves, i.e., for any given direction of input light, the output follows an arbitrarily selected direction for the refracted light, covering any desired permutation function between the input light and the refracted output light. Once the supervised optimization is complete for a given target RFG, the resulting design is fabricated and assembled to form the physical 3D material to perform the desired refractive function between the input and output waves passing through a thin optical volume. In addition to monochrome RFG designs, we also report the use of wavelength multiplexing to simultaneously execute a group of arbitrary refractive functions through the same thin material, each unique function performed at a separate wavelength. In these wavelength-multiplexed RFG designs, switching the illumination wavelength changes the refractive function, covering a set of independent mappings between the directions of the input and output waves. To show the proof of concept of an RFG design, we experimentally demonstrated the programming of a permutation refractive function and negative refractive function (\({\theta }_{{out}}={\theta }_{{in}}\), \({\varphi }_{{out}}={\varphi }_{{in}}+{180}^{\circ}\)) at the terahertz (THz) part of the spectrum using 3D-printed devices. Without the need for dispersion engineering or deeply sub-wavelength material structures, arbitrary programming of refractive functions opens up new opportunities for the design of advanced optical devices and systems.

a An RFG comprising K transmissive surfaces in air with an axial separation of \({z}_{{ll}}\) between the successive surfaces (e.g., \({z}_{{ll}}\) ~ \(6\lambda\)). The RFG refracts an input wave along the direction \({\hat{k}}_{{in}}\) into the direction \({\hat{k}}_{{out}}\), where \({\hat{k}}_{{out}}\approx {\hat{k}}_{{target}}=f({\hat{k}}_{{in}})\) and \(f\) is the target refractive function of interest. b The set of all \(\hat{k}\) vectors of interest for a given maximum angle \({\theta }_{\max }\) and a finite aperture width of \({D}_{a}\), represented by the dots. c The mapping of the \(\hat{k}\) vectors under different refractive functions \(f\) represented by the binary matrices \(R\). The mapping is encoded in the color of the dots. For visual aid, the mappings of three \(\hat{k}\) vectors are also highlighted with a triangle, a circle, and a square to guide the eye.

The architecture of an RFG is shown in Fig. 1a. A set of \(K\) optimized transmissive surfaces, placed between the input and output apertures, form the core of an RFG. For this work, we only consider phase-only surfaces that modulate the phase of the incident wave. Without loss of generalization, the amplitude modulation is assumed to be negligible, which is a valid assumption here, considering the short axial thickness of an RFG design. The RFG redirects a given input wave, propagating along the direction defined by the unit vector \({\hat{k}}_{{in}}\), into the output direction \({\hat{k}}_{{out}}\) such that \({\hat{k}}_{{out}}\approx {\hat{k}}_{{target}}\), where \({\hat{k}}_{{target}}=f({\hat{k}}_{{in}})\) and \(f\) is the target/desired refractive function, defining the mapping between the input and output directions. The unit vector \(\hat{k}\) denotes the direction of the wavevector \(\vec{k}\) of a plane wave, i.e., \(\vec{k}=\frac{2\pi }{\lambda }\hat{k}\), where \(\lambda\) is the wavelength of light. The unit vector \(\hat{k}\) encapsulates the two angles \(\theta\) and \(\varphi\), i.e., polar/zenith angle and azimuthal angle52 in a spherical coordinate system (see Fig. 1a), describing the propagation direction as follows:

Since \({k}_{z}^{2}=1-{k}_{x}^{2}-{k}_{y}^{2}\), a more succinct representation of \(\hat{k}\) is the 2D-vector \(({k}_{x},{k}_{y})\)53. Although \(\theta\) and \(\varphi\) can be continuous in principle, the resolution \({\delta }_{k}\) of \({k}_{x}\) and \({k}_{y}\) allowed by a finite aperture of dimension \({D}_{a}\) is also finite54, i.e., \({\delta }_{k}\approx \frac{\lambda }{{D}_{a}}\). Therefore, for a given acceptance angle \({\theta }_{\max }\) (the maximum angle with respect to the \(z\) axis), the set \({\mathbb{K}}\) of all \(\hat{k}\) vectors of interest can be written as: \({\mathbb{K}}{\mathbb{=}}\{({k}_{x},{k}_{y}):{k}_{x}=p\frac{\lambda }{{D}_{a}},{k}_{y}=q\frac{\lambda }{{D}_{a}},{k}_{x}^{2}+{k}_{y}^{2} < {\sin }^{2}{\theta }_{\max }\}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are integers. The elements of this set are represented by the dots within the circle of radius \(\sin {\theta }_{\max }\) in Fig. 1b, and can be enumerated as \(\{{\hat{k}}_{1},{\hat{k}}_{2},\cdots,{\hat{k}}_{{N}_{m}}\}\) where \({N}_{m}=\left|{\mathbb{K}}\right|\) is the number of elements in \({\mathbb{K}}\). An arbitrary refractive function \(f\) can be thought of as a mapping from \({\mathbb{K}}\) to \({\mathbb{K}}\), i.e., \(f:{\mathbb{K}}{\mathbb{\to }}{\mathbb{K}}\). Each of the dots, defining the set \({\mathbb{K}}\), represents a ‘direction' that the input or output wave can have.

The mapping of \({\mathbb{K}}\) under an arbitrary refractive function \(f\) can be described by a binary \({N}_{m}\times {N}_{m}\) matrix \(R\) (such as the ones shown in Fig. 1c), where the 1's in the matrix define the coupling between \({\hat{k}}_{{in}}\) and \({\hat{k}}_{{target}}\). In other words, \(R[p,q]=1\) implies that if \({\hat{k}}_{{in}}={\hat{k}}_{q}\), then \({\hat{k}}_{{target}}=f({\hat{k}}_{{in}})={\hat{k}}_{p}\) where \(p,q\in \left\{{{\mathrm{1,2}}},\cdots,{N}_{m}\right\}\). We show a few examples of such matrices \(R\) and the corresponding mappings of the input directions in Fig. 1c, where each mapping is encoded in the color of the elements of \({\mathbb{K}}\). For example, an identity matrix (first column of Fig. 1c) represents the free-space refractive function (\({\hat{k}}_{{target}}={\hat{k}}_{{in}}\) or \({\theta }_{{target}}={\theta }_{{in}},{\varphi }_{{target}}={\varphi }_{{in}}\)), whereas the flipped identity matrix (second column of Fig. 1c) represents the negative refractive function (\({\theta }_{{target}}={\theta }_{{in}},{\varphi }_{{target}}={\varphi }_{{in}}+{180}^{\circ}\)). A more general form of an arbitrary refractive function can be represented by an arbitrarily selected permutation matrix, which defines an arbitrary mapping between \({\hat{k}}_{{in}}\) and \({\hat{k}}_{{target}}\) (third column of Fig. 1c). As another alternative for \(f\), we can also envision an arbitrarily filtered and permuted refractive function (fourth column of Fig. 1c), where the input waves traveling in certain arbitrarily chosen directions (the ones corresponding to the columns with all zeros) are filtered out, whereas the waves in the other directions are redirected in a manner following the permutation defined by \(f\) or the corresponding \(R\).

The design of an RFG follows supervised learning using pairs of input direction \({\hat{k}}_{{in}}\) (equivalently, \({\theta }_{{in}},{\varphi }_{{in}}\)) and target direction \({\hat{k}}_{{target}}\) (equivalently, \({\theta }_{{target}},{\varphi }_{{target}}\)), defined based on the desired/target refractive function \(f\) represented by \(R\). This involves angular spectrum-approach based numerical simulation of wave propagation through a digital model of the RFG (see the “Methods” section). For a wavefront corresponding to \({\hat{k}}_{{in}}\) at the input aperture, the wavefront leaving the output aperture is numerically simulated; the error between the output wavefront and the wavefront corresponding to \({\hat{k}}_{{target}}\) is backpropagated to update and iteratively optimize the surface phase features using a gradient descent-based algorithm; see the “Methods” section for details. Unless otherwise stated, we assumed an operating wavelength of λ = 0.75 \({{{\rm{mm}}}}\) for the results shown in the following sections. However, we emphasize that the presented conclusions hold for any wavelength of interest, as long as the dimensions are scaled proportionally to the illumination wavelength, \(\lambda\).

The results and analyses presented in the subsections leading up to the “Experimental results” as well as the animations presented in the Supplementary Movies 1–4 are based on numerical simulations. Unless otherwise stated, each diffractive surface in these simulations consists of \(200\times 200\) independently optimized phase features/elements. Each phase element spans an area of \(0.53\lambda \times 0.53\lambda\), resulting in a total surface width of \(106\lambda\). For arbitrary permutation refractive functions, both the input and output apertures have a width of \(10.6\lambda\); for negative refractive functions, this width is set to \(15.9\lambda\). The separation between consecutive planes—whether they contain input/output apertures or diffractive surfaces—is set to \(6\lambda\), unless specified otherwise. The maximum input polar angle \({\theta }_{\max }\) is assumed to be \({60}^\circ\).

We begin with the design of an arbitrarily permuted refractive function, where the target mapping between the input and output directions is defined by an arbitrarily chosen permutation matrix \(R\) (see Fig. 2a and the 3rd column of Fig. 1c). We designed an RFG comprising \(K=8\) structured surfaces to implement this refractive function, where the axial distance between two consecutive surfaces \({z}_{{ll}}\) was \(6\lambda\), giving an axial span of \({z}_{1K}\approx 50\lambda\) between the first and the last layers. The optimized phase profiles of these surfaces are shown in Fig. 2c. For each input direction \({\hat{k}}_{{in}}\), the corresponding output angle error is also shown in Fig. 2b. This output angle error \(\varepsilon\) is defined as the angle between \({\hat{k}}_{{out}}\) and \({\hat{k}}_{{target}}=f({\hat{k}}_{{in}})\). The estimation of the output wave direction \({\hat{k}}_{{out}}\) from the output wavefront is described in the “Method” section. Figure 2b reveals that the angular errors between the output directions and the target directions are negligible (less than \(0.1{4}^\circ\)), revealing the success of the RFG in implementing the arbitrarily permuted refractive function, i.e., \({{\hat{k}}_{{out}}\approx \hat{k}}_{{target}}=f({\hat{k}}_{{in}})\). Supplementary Movie 1 also shows the far-field output intensity as the input wave direction is swept, together with the corresponding target patterns that follow \(f\).

a The matrix \(R\) representing the arbitrarily permuted refractive function, the same as the one depicted in Fig. 1c, 3rd column. b The error in output angles for all the input directions. c The optimized phase profiles of the RFG surfaces. Here \({z}_{{ll}}\approx 6\lambda\), giving a total axial thickness of \({z}_{1-K}\approx 50\lambda\) between the first and the last surfaces.

In Fig. 3, we further analyze the errors of the refractive function implementation as the wavelength \({\lambda }_{{test}}\) of the input light deviates from the design wavelength \({\lambda }_{{train}}\) that the RFG is trained to operate at. While evaluating the error as a function of \({\lambda }_{{test}}\), we kept the input and target directions at \({\lambda }_{{test}}\) the same as those at \({\lambda }_{{train}}\). At each test wavelength \({\lambda }_{{test}}\), the distribution of the angular errors (over \({N}_{m}\) different input directions) is encapsulated with a box-and-whisker diagram in Fig. 3a. As expected, the error increases as \({\lambda }_{{test}}\) deviates from \({\lambda }_{{train}}\). However, the angular errors remain below \({4}^\circ\) over a wavelength range of \(\sim 0.99{\lambda }_{{train}}\) to \(\sim 1.01{\lambda }_{{train}}.\) The resilience against changes in wavelength can be improved by incorporating random wavelength variations during training. In Fig. 3b, we report the angular error of another design which was trained by randomly selecting the illumination wavelength from a desired range of interest during training, i.e., \({\lambda }_{{train}} \sim {{{\rm{Uniform}}}}\)(742.5 μm,757.5 μm). The angular errors of this “vaccinated” design remain limited to \(\sim \! {1}^\circ\) over the same wavelength range, showing the flexibility of our design approach to adapt to different requirements.

a Distribution of the output angle error as a function of the test wavelength \({\lambda }_{{test}}\), for the same RFG of Fig. 2, which was trained for an illumination wavelength of \(750\,{{{\rm{\mu }}}}{{{\rm{m}}}}\), i.e., \({\lambda }_{{train}}=750\,{{{\rm{\mu }}}}{{{\rm{m}}}}\). The distributions arise from the values corresponding to all the input directions. b Distribution of the output angle error as a function of the test wavelength \({\lambda }_{{test}}\), for an RFG design “vaccinated” against changes in wavelength. c Distribution of the output angle errors as a function of \(K\), while \({z}_{{ll}}\) is kept constant at \(\sim \! 6\lambda\). d Distribution of the output angle errors as a function of \({z}_{{ll}}\), while \(K\) is kept constant at \(4\).

Figure 3 further depicts the dependence of the output errors on the number of structured surfaces \(K\) and the surface-to-surface distance \({z}_{{ll}}\) comprising the RFG structure. For Fig. 3c, we decreased \(K\) from 8 to 3, keeping \({z}_{{ll}}=6\lambda\). The output angle errors increased as \(K\) decreased; however, we can see that the errors remain below \(1^\circ\) even when \(K\) is decreased to 4. For Fig. 3d, we set the number of structured surfaces \(K=4\) and reduced the surface-to-surface distance \({z}_{{ll}}\) from \(6\lambda\) to \(4\lambda\). On average, the output error increased with a decrease in \({z}_{{ll}}\). However, even with \(K=4\) and \({z}_{{ll}}=4\lambda\), the output angle errors stay below \(1.6^\circ\), demonstrating an arbitrarily permuted refractive function with an RFG spanning only \(\sim \! 15\lambda\) along the axial direction. To clarify, each \(K\) (\({z}_{{ll}}\)) value in Fig. 3c (3 d) represents a separately trained RFG design for the same target refractive function as in Fig. 2a.

An important metric of an RFG design is the output diffraction efficiency (\({{{\rm{DE}}}}\)), i.e., ratio between the diffracted output power along the target direction and the incident power at the input aperture; see the “Methods” section. For the RFG reported in Fig. 2, the diffraction efficiencies along the target directions ranged from 0.07% to 0.62%, see the 1st row of Fig. 4a. We can tune the diffraction efficiency of an RFG design by properly modifying the training loss function. By using an additional term in the loss function, weighted by \(\eta\) (a training hyperparameter), which penalizes against low diffraction efficiency, we can improve the output diffraction efficiencies of the resulting design with a relatively small sacrifice in the output error performance. For example, by using \(\eta=30\), we can have an RFG design where the maximum output angle error is \(0.87^\circ\), while the minimum diffraction efficiency increases to 2.75% (see the 3rd row of Fig. 4a). Figure 4b further summarizes the trade-off between the RFG performance and the output diffraction efficiency as a function of \(\eta\).

a Output angle errors and diffraction efficiencies of three different RFG designs trained with different values of the hyperparameter \(\eta\) (see Eq. (12)). Here, the target refractive function is the one shown in Fig. 2a. b Distribution of output angle errors and diffraction efficiencies as a function of \(\eta\). Each value of the training hyperparameter \(\eta\) corresponds to a separately optimized RFG design. For all the designs, \(K=8\) and \({z}_{{ll}}\approx 6\lambda\).

Next, we demonstrate the case of an arbitrarily filtered and permuted refractive function. Figure 5a depicts the target refractive function in this case. Here, ~90% of the input directions are filtered out at the output aperture, whereas the rest are redirected as specified by the non-zero elements of \(R\); stated differently, \(R\) in this case refers to an arbitrary permutation matrix with ~90% of its columns replaced with zeros, corresponding to the filtering of specific directions of input light. To implement this filtered refractive function, we designed an RFG comprising \(K=8\) surfaces, where the distance between consecutive surfaces \({z}_{{ll}}\) was \(6\lambda\), yielding an axial span of \({z}_{1K}\approx 50\lambda\) between the first and the last surfaces. The optimized phase profiles of these surfaces are shown in Fig. 5e. Figure 5b reveals negligible errors in the output angles for the input directions which are not filtered. At the same time, the diffraction efficiencies along the targeted output directions are \( > 10\%\); see Fig. 5c. To evaluate the filtering operation, we also calculated the relative percentage of residual power (i.e., the ratio between the power at the output and the power at the input aperture; see the “Methods” section) for each one of the filtered out directions. As shown in Fig. 5d, the relative power transmission is <1% for all the input directions to be filtered, correctly approximating this arbitrarily filtered and permuted refractive function.

The ratio of the filtered directions is ~90%. b Output angle error \(\varepsilon\) for all the unfiltered input directions. c Output diffraction efficiency \({{{\rm{DE}}}}\) for all the unfiltered input directions. d Relative residual power \({{{\rm{RRP}}}}\) for the filtered input directions. e The optimized phase profiles of the RFG surfaces.

We also considered a specific form of refractive function, i.e., the negative refractive function, where \({\theta }_{{target}}={\theta }_{{in}}\) and \({\varphi }_{{target}}={\varphi }_{{in}}+{180}^\circ\); see the third column of Figs. 1c and 6. To train for this refractive function, \({\theta }_{{in}}\) and \({\varphi }_{{in}}\) are randomly sampled from the uniform distributions \({{{\rm{Uniform}}}}\left({0}^\circ,{\theta }_{\max }={60}^\circ \right)\) and \({{{\rm{Uniform}}}}\left({0}^\circ,{360}^\circ \right)\), respectively. We designed an RFG comprising \(K=5\) surfaces for implementing the negative refractive function, and the optimized phase profiles are shown in Fig. 6c. For a dense grid of input directions \({\hat{k}}_{{in}}\), we show the corresponding output angle errors in Fig. 6a and the resulting diffraction efficiencies in Fig. 6b. While the maximum output angle error is \(\sim \! {2}^\circ\), this relatively large error occurs only when \({\theta }_{{in}}\) is close to \({\theta }_{\max }={60}^\circ\) because of the limited amount of training examples around these angular values at the edges. Figure 6d depicts the “operating curve” of this RFG, which plots the maximum acceptable input angle \({\theta }_{M}\) vs. the maximum acceptable output angle error \({\varepsilon }_{M}\), such that \(\varepsilon \le {\varepsilon }_{M}\) if \({\theta }_{{in}}\le {\theta }_{M}\). This plot shows that the RFG can operate at larger input angles if relatively larger errors are tolerated. For example, when \({\theta }_{{in}}\le 58^\circ,\) the output angle error stays below \(1^\circ\), as shown in Fig. 6e. Also, Fig. 6b plots the output diffraction efficiency for all the input directions, revealing high diffraction efficiency even without the use of a diffraction efficiency-related term in the training loss function.

The distance \({z}_{{ll}}\) between consecutive surfaces is \(\sim 6\lambda\), giving an axial distance of \({z}_{1-K}\approx 30\lambda\) between the first and the last transmissive surfaces. d The operating curve of the RFG design, showing \({\theta }_{M}\) (the maximum acceptable \({\theta }_{{in}}\)) as a function of the maximum acceptable angle error, \({\varepsilon }_{M}\). e When \({\varepsilon }_{M}={1}^\circ\), \({\theta }_{M}={58}^\circ\), i.e., for all the input directions with \({\theta }_{{in}} < {58}^\circ\), the output angle error is less than \(1^\circ\).

Wavelength multiplexing can be used to implement completely different refractive functions, simultaneously executed through the same RFG with a unique refractive function assigned to each wavelength of interest. We demonstrated this wavelength multiplexing capability by designing an RFG that performs three different arbitrarily permuted refractive functions at three different wavelengths, as shown in Fig. 7a, top row. Without loss in generality, we chose the refractive functions such that the corresponding permutation matrices \({R}_{1}\), R2, and \({R}_{3}\) do not have overlapping entries, i.e., \({\sum}_{m,n}{R}_{i}\left[m,n\right]{R}_{j}\left[m,n\right]=0\) if \(i \, \ne \, j\). We chose the wavelengths \({\lambda }_{1}=0.70\,{{{\rm{mm}}}}\), \({\lambda }_{2}=0.75\,{{{\rm{mm}}}}\), and \({\lambda }_{3}=0.80\,{{{\rm{mm}}}}\) to implement these refractive functions with an RFG comprising \(K=8\) surfaces. The refractive indices of the assumed RFG material at these wavelengths (\({\lambda }_{1},\,{\lambda }_{2},\,{\lambda }_{3}\)) are n1 = 1.6512, n2 = 1.6518, and n3 = 1.6524, respectively. The optimized thicknesses of the RFG surfaces are shown in Fig. 7b. As depicted in Fig. 7a (second row), the output angle error stays below \({0.5}^\circ\) for all the input directions for the three unique refractive functions at the three wavelengths, demonstrating the success of wavelength multiplexing of refractive functions performed simultaneously through the same RFG. Note from the second row of Fig. 7a that the set of input directions for these refractive functions are not identical, since the grid-spacing depends on the wavelength (see Fig. 1b).

a The matrices representing the targeted arbitrarily permuted refractive functions at three distinct wavelengths (top row). The bottom row shows, for a \(K=8\) RFG design, the error in the output angle as a function of the input direction at these three wavelengths. b The optimized thickness profiles of the RFG surfaces. The distance \({z}_{{ll}}\) between consecutive surfaces is \(\sim 6{\lambda }_{2}\), giving an axial distance of \({z}_{1-K}\approx 50{\lambda }_{2}\) between the first and the last transmissive surfaces.

It is important to emphasize that this wavelength-multiplexed RFG design does not make use of the dispersion of the transmissive layers for its refractive function implementation accuracy; stated differently, even if we assume that the refractive indices of the assumed RFG material at these wavelengths (\({\lambda }_{1},\,{\lambda }_{2},\,{\lambda }_{3}\)) are equal, i.e., n1 = n2 = n3 = n, one could still perform wavelength-multiplexed refractive functions through an RFG design with the same level of accuracy and performance as shown earlier. Supplementary Fig. S2 compares the performance of an alternative design with flat dispersion, where n = 1.6518 was selected for all 3 wavelengths, revealing a statistically similar RFG performance as in Fig. 7. Supplementary Movie 2 also shows the far-field output intensity as the input wave direction is changed at these three wavelengths, together with the target patterns that follow the desired \({f}_{i}\) at the corresponding \({\lambda }_{i}\). These results indicate that the refractive function separation between different illumination wavelengths is based on the wavelength dependence of the free-space propagation kernel, and this unique capability does not need dispersion engineering of specialized materials, which is rather important for practical applications since one can readily work with almost any transmissive substrate that is available at a given desired spectral band.

We experimentally demonstrated the success of programmable refractive function implementation at THz part of the spectrum with an illumination wavelength of \(\lambda=0.75\,{{{\rm{mm}}}}\). We designed an RFG comprising \(K=3\) phase-only surfaces to implement the negative refractive function for \({\theta }_{{in}}\le {\theta }_{\max }\) \(={30}^\circ\). For this design, the width of the structured surfaces was selected as 80 mm, with a feature size of 0.4 mm, resulting in \(\sim\)0.12 million independently optimizable phase features for the RFG design. The distance between neighboring surfaces was \(\sim \! 16\lambda\), giving an axial span of \({z}_{1-K}\approx 32\lambda\) for the RFG design.

For resilience against potential misalignments during the experiment, the RFG design was “vaccinated” by applying random lateral shifts \(\left(\Delta x,\Delta y\right)\) to the surfaces during the digital training process. Similarly, the axial distances between the transmissive layers were also vaccinated against imperfections by adding random noise (\(\Delta z\)) in the optical forward model used during training. These random variables \(\Delta x\), \(\Delta y\), and \(\Delta z\) were sampled from uniform distributions, i.e., \({{{\rm{Uniform}}}}\left(-0.15\lambda,0.15\lambda \right)\). The optimized phase profiles of the resulting RFG surfaces are shown in Fig. 8a, together with the output angle errors and diffraction efficiencies obtained in numerical simulations.

Also shown are the output angle errors and the diffraction efficiencies obtained in simulation. b The RFG hardware, assembled from the structured surfaces and input/output apertures, fabricated using 3D-printing. c The THz setup comprising the source and the detector, together with the 3D-printed RFG.

After the deep learning-based supervised design of the desired RFG, the optimized surfaces were fabricated using a 3D printer and assembled, together with the input and output apertures, to form the physical RFG, as shown in Fig. 8b. This physically assembled RFG was experimentally tested with the system shown in Fig. 8c, which comprises a THz source and a THz scanning detector; see the “Methods” section for details.

Figure 9 shows the experimentally measured output intensities at an axial distance of \(z=80\,{{{\rm{mm}}}}\) from the output aperture, together with the corresponding simulation results for different input wave directions defined by\(\,{\theta }_{{in}}\) and \({\varphi }_{{in}}\). During these experiments, the variation of \({\theta }_{{in}}\) was realized by moving the source horizontally along an arc (see Supplementary Fig. S1b), while the variation of \({\varphi }_{{in}}\) was implemented by in-plane rotation (relative to the source) of the RFG surfaces and the input and output apertures. To compensate for the relative rotation between the RFG and the detector plane, the fields of view (FOVs) corresponding to the experimental measurements were rotated by the same amount (in the opposite direction), as seen in Fig. 9. An additional calibration step to take into account the height of the source relative to the input aperture was also used; see Supplementary Fig. S1a.

Each panel corresponds to the input direction defined by \(\left({\theta }_{{in}},{\varphi }_{{in}}\right)\) and compares the simulated and experimental diffraction patterns measured at a distance of \(z=80\,{{{\rm{mm}}}}\) from the output aperture of the RFG (see Fig. 9c). The green dot marks the center \(\left({{\mathrm{0,0}}}\right)\) of the FOV and the red dot marks the first moment of the diffracted intensity pattern; also see Supplementary Fig. S1b. In each panel, the mismatch between the numerical simulation and the experimental result, defined as the angle \({\varepsilon }_{{sim}-\exp }\) between the simulated output wave and the experimentally measured output wave, is also reported.

Visual assessment of the output intensity patterns in Fig. 9 reveals a very good agreement between the simulated patterns and the measured output patterns. For quantitative analysis, we estimated the direction of the output waves (\({\theta }_{{out}}\), \({\varphi }_{{out}}\)) from the first moments (center-of-mass) of the diffracted output intensity patterns, which are marked by red dots in Fig. 9; also see Supplementary Fig. S1b. To quantify the mismatch between our simulations and experimental results, the angle between the output directions obtained from each simulation and the corresponding experiment (\({\varepsilon }_{{sim}-\exp }\)) is reported at the bottom of each panel corresponding to a \(\left({\theta }_{{in}},{\varphi }_{{in}}\right)\) combination. The minimum and maximum values of this angular error, \({\varepsilon }_{{sim}-\exp }\), are \({0.23}^\circ\) and \({2.01}^\circ\), which occur at \(\left({\theta }_{{in}},{\varphi }_{{in}}\right)=\left({19.81}^\circ,{276.48}^\circ \right)\) and \(\left({\theta }_{{in}},{\varphi }_{{in}}\right)=\left({10.03}^\circ,{197.49}^\circ \right)\), respectively. The mean angular error is \({1.04}^\circ\). These experimental results successfully demonstrate the proof of concept of our refractive function programming capability using the presented framework.

In addition to negative refractive function implementation, we also experimentally demonstrated a discrete permutation of input directions; see Fig. 10. We designed an RFG comprising \(K=3\) transmissive surfaces to implement a randomly selected permutation of five discrete input directions over a narrow angular range (\({\theta }_{\max }=4^\circ\)). For this design, the diffractive surfaces were 64 mm wide with a feature size of 0.4 mm, yielding \({{\mathrm{76,800}}}\) independently optimized phase elements. The axial separation between neighboring surfaces was \(\sim \! 16\lambda\), resulting in a total device span of \({z}_{1-K}\approx 32\lambda\). The optimized phase profiles for the three diffractive surfaces are shown in Fig. 10a, along with the numerically evaluated angular errors and diffraction efficiencies corresponding to each input direction. The surfaces were fabricated via 3D printing and assembled into a complete RFG system, as shown in Fig. 10b. Figure 10c presents a comparison between the simulated and measured intensity patterns at the detector plane, positioned 160 mm from the output aperture, for each of the input directions of interest. The green and red dots mark the center of the FOV and the first moment of the diffracted intensity pattern, respectively. The estimated angular mismatches \({\varepsilon }_{{sim}-\exp }\) between our simulations and experimental results remain below 1.4° for all tested directions, confirming the successful implementation of the desired permutation of input angles by the fabricated RFG.

The measured angular deviation \({\varepsilon }_{{sim}-\exp }\) remains below 1.4° in all cases, demonstrating close agreement between the simulations and experimental results.

In this paper, we presented refractive function programming, i.e., on-demand engineering of the relationship between the input and output wave directions, by a collection of spatially optimized surfaces that comprises a physical RFG, axially spanning \(\sim \! 15\lambda -50\lambda\). We demonstrated the engineering of the output wave direction independently and arbitrarily for a set of input directions of interest, including arbitrarily filtered and permuted refractive functions as well as wavelength-multiplexed arbitrarily permuted refractive functions. We also reported other examples of refractive function programming, such as the negative refractive function, along with a proof-of-concept experimental demonstration of it at the THz part of the spectrum using a 3D-printed RFG. Related works on volumetric meta-optics have demonstrated the sorting of input light based on wavelength, polarization, and direction55,56,57; however, the dimensionality of the input direction space was limited to ≤5. More importantly, these approaches do not achieve arbitrary permutation of input directions, i.e., they do not demonstrate arbitrary refractive function programming.

While our design approach draws on supervised learning tools, it does not aim to learn from data a general predictive model that maps an input direction \({\hat{k}}_{{in}}\) to a corresponding output direction \({\hat{k}}_{{out}}\). Instead, the desired functional mapping between input and output directions is known a priori and specified explicitly by the task—for example, an arbitrarily selected permutation or a negative refraction function. The RFG is optimized to enforce this prescribed mapping between the directions of the input and output waves. The surface phase profiles are optimized to minimize the output angular error using deep learning tools such as error-backpropagation and gradient descent on a physics-based wave propagation model (see the “Methods” section for details). In the case of permutation tasks that are finite-dimensional, the input direction can only be selected from a fixed discrete grid, and in general, no generalization beyond this grid is required. In contrast, for continuous mappings such as negative refractive function, the input direction can assume any value within a continuous domain. In this case, during the optimization/training, the input angles are randomly sampled from this continuous domain. Since the probability of the exact test directions being sampled during training is infinitesimal, it is valid to assume that the test directions differ from the training set—requiring generalization in the learning-theoretic sense. Thus, the problem of refractive function generation can require meaningful generalization depending on the nature of the function to be generated.

The supervised learning-based design approach we adopt offers several advantages. First, it naturally supports a ‘vaccination' strategy, whereby the design is made resilient to anticipated deviations from ideal conditions (such as wavelength shifts or hardware misalignments) by introducing such deviations as random noise during training; see Fig. 3b. Second, our framework allows for a desired trade-off among competing performance metrics to be explicitly controlled through loss function engineering, as demonstrated in Fig. 4. To further highlight the versatility of our physics-based learning framework, we apply it to a classical task: design of light focusing elements. While an ideal lens defined by the phase profile \(\psi \left(x,y\right)=\frac{2\pi }{\lambda }\sqrt{{x}^{2}+{y}^{2}+{f}^{2}}\) can provide ideal focusing at wavelength \(\lambda\) and focal length \(f\), its performance deteriorates when implemented using discretized phase elements. Under such constraints, our method can discover superior solutions. Supplementary Fig. S8 presents designs of focusing optics comprising \(K\) diffractive surfaces, each consisting of phase elements discretized at \(\lambda /2\) resolution and quantized into 8 uniformly spaced phase levels between 0 and \(2\pi\), i.e., 3 phase bit-depth. For these simulations, we assume \(\lambda=400\,{{{\rm{nm}}}}\). The diameter of the diffractive surface(s) and the focal distance are assumed to be \(288\lambda\) and \(100\lambda,\) respectively, resulting in a numerical aperture of 0.82. The diameter of the focal spot (region of interest, ROI) is set to be \(\lambda\). To demonstrate the flexibility of tweaking the trade-off among performance metrics, we define two figures of merit relevant to energy localization: focusing efficiency (FE), which reports the ratio of optical power within the ROI to total input power, and power concentration ratio (PCR), which reports the ratio of power inside the ROI to that outside it. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S8, the learned diffractive focusing designs outperform the ideal lens phase profile (phase-wrapped and quantized) in both FE and PCR, even when using the same design degrees of freedom with \(K=1\). With \(K=2\) diffractive surfaces, the performance improves further, demonstrating the advantages of structural depth in our framework. Moreover, the ability to explicitly tune the trade-off between FE and PCR via the loss function engineering further highlights the flexibility of our approach. This example illustrates how physics-based learning can push the boundaries of diffractive focusing beyond classical designs while remaining compatible with realistic fabrication constraints such as limited phase bit-depth.

While our RFG framework assumes phase-only modulation with unit transmission amplitude, this approximation is justified by the fact that absorption can be minimized through appropriate material selection. Since the same phase patterns can be rescaled to any operating wavelength by proportionally adjusting the physical dimensions of the diffractive design, such as the lateral pitch and axial separation, this design methodology remains broadly applicable across different spectral bands where low-loss materials are available. For example, high-resolution fabrication techniques in the visible regime allow for the use of low-loss dielectrics such as PMMA58, whose negligible extinction coefficient enables the physical implementation of phase-only diffractive surfaces without significant absorption. To demonstrate this, we evaluated the permutation refractive function design of Fig. 4 (the one trained with \(\eta=30\)) at a visible wavelength of 562.5 nm using the same optimized phase profiles, with all physical dimensions scaled according to the illumination wavelength. The diffractive surfaces were assumed to be fabricated from PMMA, with a refractive index of 1.4863 and an extinction coefficient of \(2.27\times {10}^{-7}\) at 562.5 nm. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S9, the angular error and diffraction efficiency remained effectively unchanged from the original THz design, despite the use of eight transmissive layers. These results confirm that the design methodology is transferable across different spectral bands, and that absorption losses can be rendered negligible through careful selection of fabrication materials.

Power loss within an RFG can also arise from Fresnel reflections caused by refractive index discontinuities at the interfaces of the diffractive surfaces. For an RFG comprising 8 transmissive surfaces, there are 16 such optical interfaces, for example. Although our wave propagation simulations assume planar phase-only modulation and, therefore, do not explicitly model these reflections, their cumulative effect can be approximately estimated. For example, for PMMA in air (n = 1.4863), each interface reflects approximately \({\left(\tfrac{n-1}{n+1}\right)}^{2}\approx 3.8\%\) of the incident power, resulting in an overall transmission factor of \({\left(1-0.038\right)}^{16}\approx 55\%\) due to interface reflections alone. In practice, these losses can be mitigated using anti-reflection coatings or index-matching layers, depending on the application requirements. Moreover, neglecting these reflections in the forward model introduces minimal error because the reflected waves are scattered by the elements of the preceding and proceeding structured layers since such secondary waves are considered noise and are not optimized for the intended output directions. This diffractive filtering of undesired secondary reflections is further supported by our THz experimental results (see Figs. 9 and 10), which show close agreement between the simulated and the measured angular output distributions.

Although the refractive functions that we discussed so far did not include many-to-one mappings between the input and output directions, i.e., more than one input directions do not result in the same output wave direction, this is not a restriction of the presented RFG framework. It is possible to design RFGs that implement ‘many-to-one' refractive functions and also one-to-many mappings, giving rise to input-direction-specific programmed beam-splitting. To demonstrate this capability, we designed an RFG that performs a many-to-one transformation, in which all the input directions of interest are mapped to the same output direction. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S10, the optimized RFG performs this mapping with low output angle error across the full input range. Supplementary Movie 3 also shows the far-field output intensity as the input wave direction is swept, together with the corresponding target patterns that follow \(f\).

As for the arbitrarily filtered and permuted refractive function reported in Fig. 5, the ratio of the filtered input directions was 90% (i.e., 10% unfiltered input directions). We observed that as the ratio of the unfiltered directions within the desired refractive function increases, their output energy begins to spill into the filtered directions, causing the \({{{\rm{RRP}}}}\) for the latter to increase relatively, decreasing the refractive function approximation accuracy. Supplementary Fig. S3 shows the dependence of the average loss of various RFG designs as a function of the average ratio of the filtered directions; also see Supplementary Fig. S4, which reports an RFG design for an arbitrarily filtered and permuted refractive function with 80% of the input directions filtered. Part of the reason behind the relatively poor performance of RFGs designed for smaller ratios of filtered input directions might be due to the arbitrary selection of the filtered and unfiltered directions, causing the unfiltered directions to leak at the output aperture into their neighboring input directions that are desired to be filtered.

The RFG that was optimized for negative refractive function, shown in Fig. 6, was trained with a loss function that does not enforce any regularization related to diffraction efficiencies. As a result, the diffraction efficiencies were not uniform, with the high values only at lower angles of incidence. We present in Supplementary Fig. S11 an alternative RFG design that emphasizes improved diffraction efficiency across a wider range of input directions. The training loss function for this design was \(L={L}_{{wf}}+5\left(1-{\theta }_{{in}}/{\theta }_{\max }\right)\left(1-{{{\rm{DE}}}}\right)\), where \({L}_{{wf}}\) is the error between the output wavefront and the target wavefront and \({DE}\) is the diffraction efficiency (see Eqs. 11 and 13). For this new design, the diffraction efficiencies remain uniformly high over a wider range and fall to lower values only as \({\theta }_{{in}}\) approaches \({\theta }_{\max }\). This improvement in diffraction efficiency is achieved at the cost of a small increase in the angular error, albeit near the edges of the input angular range only, i.e., \({\theta }_{{in}}\approx {\theta }_{\max }\). A detailed analysis of the output diffraction efficiency performance is presented in Supplementary Fig. S11d, where we quantified the angular power distribution at the output aperture. At the bottom-right of Supplementary Fig. S11d, we report a “confusion matrix” that shows the diffraction efficiencies along all the output directions \({\hat{k}}_{{out}}\) for a given input direction \({\hat{k}}_{{in}}\). The dominantly flipped-diagonal structure of the confusion matrix (same as the structure of the matrix representing the negative refractive function, see Fig. 1) reveals the successful realization of the target refractive function. However, for input directions at the edge (\({\theta }_{{in}}\approx {\theta }_{\max }\)), there is significant leakage of power out of the target direction at the output aperture. The total output diffraction efficiency, obtained by summing over the rows of the “confusion matrix”, can approach 99.24%, as shown in the accompanying plot; see top-right of Supplementary Fig. S11d.

In addition to the wavelength-multiplexed RFGs reported in our “Results” section, it is also possible to achieve polarization multiplexing of refractive functions using isotropic transmissive materials constituting the RFG; such an isotropic RFG design needs to be augmented with a separate, fixed polarizer array positioned between successive structured layers. In such an RFG design, different orthogonal polarization states at the input aperture can perform independent and arbitrarily selected refractive functions, and the use of a fixed/predetermined array of polarizers within the thin material volume would help us better utilize the different degrees of freedom of the RFG for different refractive functions. To demonstrate this capability, we designed an RFG comprising \(K=8\) transmissive surfaces, with a fixed array of orthogonal polarizers placed after the fourth surface; see Supplementary Fig. S12c. The structure was trained to implement two distinct permutation refractive functions at two orthogonal linear polarization states, i.e., horizontal (\(p=0^\circ\)) and vertical (\(p={90}^\circ\)). Simulation results show that the output angle errors are limited to \(\sim \! {0.5}^\circ\) across the entire input angular grid for both polarizations, confirming the feasibility of polarization-multiplexed refractive function generation using a shared diffractive volume. Supplementary Movie 4 also shows the far-field output intensity as the input wave direction is changed at these two polarization states, together with the target patterns that follow the desired \({f}_{i}\) at the corresponding polarization.

It is also interesting to consider the directionality of refractive functions. For example, the RFG reported in Fig. 2, when used in the reverse axial direction, approximately performs the inverse of the forward refractive function \(f\), albeit with a relatively large error since this reverse operation was not part of its training or design stage. The output angle errors of this RFG, together with the diffraction efficiencies, for propagation in the reverse axial direction are shown in Supplementary Fig. S5; here, the target directions in the reverse path are set by \({f}^{-1}\). With proper training that takes into account both the forward and backward operation of the RFG design, it should be possible to further optimize the RFG to perform a target refractive function (\(f\)) in the forward direction and its inverse (\({f}^{-1}\)) in the reverse direction equally well. It should also be possible to design a unidirectional RFG which performs a desired refractive function in the forward direction only, while blocking all the directions of illumination in the reverse. While time-reversal symmetry prohibits unidirectional behavior in a lossless electromagnetic system without e.g., magneto-optical effects, this constraint does not strictly apply to RFGs. Importantly, the RFG is not a lossless system: power is inherently lost at the edges of the finite-sized diffractive surfaces due to diffraction and material absorption. This allows for asymmetry in how loss manifests across the forward and backward propagation paths. By leveraging this asymmetry into our learning framework, we can engineer the loss distribution differently for the two directions, achieving functionally unidirectional behavior without violating reciprocity. To better highlight this, we define a composite loss function \(L={L}_{{wf}}^{\left(f\right)}+{\eta }_{f}(1-{{{{\rm{DE}}}}}^{\left(f\right)})+{\eta }_{b}{{{{\rm{DE}}}}}^{\left(b\right)}\), where \({L}_{{wf}}\) defines the error between the output wavefront and the target wavefront (see Eq. 11), \({DE}\) denotes the diffraction efficiency (see Eq. 13). The superscripts \(\left(f\right)\) and \(\left(b\right)\) denote the forward and backward directions, respectively, while \({\eta }_{f}\) and \({\eta }_{b}\) are training hyperparameters defining the weights of the respective loss terms. This formulation allows for promoting high diffractive efficiency in the desired forward direction while simultaneously suppressing efficiency in the undesired reverse direction, i.e., creating an asymmetric diffractive system. Simulation results for two RFG designs trained using this loss function are shown in Supplementary Figs. S6 and S7. In the first case, we set \({\eta }_{f}=0\) and \({\eta }_{b}=1\), only penalizing the diffraction efficiency in the backward direction. This results in approximately six orders of magnitude difference between the median diffraction efficiencies in the forward and backward directions, in favor of the forward direction, illustrating the unidirectional behavior of our design. As desired, the angular error in the forward direction remains below 1°; see Supplementary Fig. 6. In the second case, reported in Supplementary Fig. 7, we simultaneously enforced high forward and low backward diffraction efficiencies by setting \({\eta }_{f}=1\) and \({\eta }_{b}=1\). This leads to further improvements in the forward diffraction efficiency (median 3.5%), while still maintaining strong suppression in the backward direction, with more than six orders of magnitude difference in median efficiencies between the forward and backward directions, once again showcasing the unidirectional behavior of our design. These results demonstrate that asymmetric loss engineering during the supervised learning phase enables functionally unidirectional RFGs, despite being implemented using passive and reciprocal materials.

In our framework, the shape of the input and output apertures—whether circular or square—is a configurable aspect of the RFG design. While the underlying physics may favor certain aperture shapes depending on the target refractive function, this choice is made prior to the training and incorporated into the physics model by defining the apertures accordingly. To illustrate this design flexibility, we present an additional design for the negative refractive function RFG reported in Fig. 6, where circular apertures of equal area are used instead of the square ones of the former design. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S13, this modification introduces a noticeable trade-off: although the diffraction efficiency decreases, the angular error across the tested input directions improves significantly. Such performance trade-offs can be further tuned through appropriate loss function engineering, as discussed earlier (see Fig. 4).

We believe that the capability to program refractive functions within passive materials could unlock unprecedented opportunities in manipulating optical waves, with major implications for optical device and system design across various applications. For example, RFGs could support applications in multi-channel optical interconnects, where distinct input directions can be routed to designated output channels with high spatial precision, enabling compact and scalable free-space optical communication links. Additionally, the intrinsic spatial and directional mapping abilities of RFGs can be harnessed for secure optical encoding, embedding information in complex, task-specific refractive transformations that are difficult to intercept or replicate without complete knowledge of the RFG design. Beyond these applications, RFGs could also be used for wave routing and optical switching. By replacing bulky optical components with compact, task-adaptive surfaces, these programmable diffractive platforms can significantly reshape photonic system design, driving advances in, e.g., communication, sensing, and imaging technologies.

The RFG is assumed to comprise \(K\) phase-only transmissive surfaces positioned axially at \({z}_{1},{z}_{2},\cdots,{z}_{K}\), respectively, between the input and the output apertures. The axial positions of the input aperture and the output aperture are denoted by \({z}_{0}\) and \({z}_{K+1}\), respectively. The physical wave propagation between the input and the output aperture is described by successive modulations of the wave by the transmissive surfaces, interleaved by free-space propagation between them. In the following notation, \(w\left(x,{y;}{z}_{l}^{-}\right)\) denotes the wave incident on the diffractive surface at \({z}_{l}\), whereas \(w\left(x,{y;}{z}_{l}^{+}\right)\) denotes the wave leaving the diffractive surface, after the corresponding phase modulation. The wave propagation through free-space between consecutive surfaces can be described by the Rayleigh–Sommerfeld diffraction integral. For \(l={{\mathrm{1,2}}},\cdots,K+1\)

Here \(w\left(x,y;{z}_{0}^{+}\right)={w}_{{in}}\left(x,y\right)\) is the input wave and \({h}_{{{{\rm{FSP}}}}}\left(x,{y;z}\right)\) is the free-space propagation kernel for an axial distance of \(z\):

where \(r=\sqrt{{x}^{2}+{y}^{2}+{z}^{2}}\). At the structured surfaces, the incident waves are locally modulated by the corresponding transmittance values that are trainable. For \(l={{\mathrm{1,2}}},\cdots,K\)

where \({t}_{l}\left(x,y\right)\) is the complex-valued transmittance function of the diffractive surface at \({z}_{l}\). One can write,

where \({a}_{l}\left(x,y\right)\) is the local amplitude/absorption and \({\psi }_{l}\left(x,y\right)\) is the phase-delay induced by the diffractive surface. For a material with negligible loss, \({a}_{l}\left(x,y\right)\approx 1\) whereas the phase delay is related to the local surface thickness \({h}_{l}\left(x,y\right)\) as follows:

where \(n\) is the refractive index of the material at the wavelength \(\lambda\).

In our numerical simulations, free-space propagation of an optical field between successive transmissive surfaces was calculated using the angular spectrum method59, which is a Fast Fourier transform-based implementation of the Rayleigh–Sommerfeld diffraction integral in Eq. (2). The fields/intensities were discretized using \(\delta \approx 0.53\lambda\) along both \(x\) and \(y\), and sufficiently zero-padded to avoid aliasing60.

For a given pair of input and target directions \(\left({\theta }_{{in}},\,{\varphi }_{{in}}\right)\) and \(({\theta }_{{target}},\,{\varphi }_{{target}})\) that satisfy the desired refractive function of interest, the wavefront incident on the input aperture at \({z}_{0}\) can be written as:

whereas

Here \({{{\rm{rect}}}}(\frac{x}{{D}_{a}}){{{\rm{rect}}}}(\frac{y}{{D}_{a}})\) defines the input aperture and \({D}_{a}\) is its lateral width. Similarly, the wave leaving the output aperture can be written as:

where \(w\left(x,{y;}{z}_{K+1}^{-}\right)\) is calculated from \(w\left(x,{y;}{z}_{0}^{+}\right)\) by successively applying Eqs. (2) and (4). The corresponding target wavefront can be written as:

The transmissive surfaces were optimized by minimizing the error between the output wavefront and the target wavefront:

For tuning the output diffraction efficiencies of the RFGs for an arbitrarily permuted refractive function, the following batch loss function was used:

where \(B\) denotes the training batch size, the subscript \(i\) indexes the examples of the input-output waves that satisfy the desired refractive function in a batch, and the diffraction efficiency (\({{{\rm{DE}}}}\)) along the target direction is defined as:

Here \({u}_{{in}}=\tfrac{{k}_{x,{in}}}{\lambda }=\frac{\sin {\theta }_{{in}}\cos {\varphi }_{{in}}}{\lambda }\), \({v}_{{in}}=\tfrac{{k}_{y,{in}}}{\lambda }=\frac{\sin {\theta }_{{in}}\sin {\varphi }_{{in}}}{\lambda }\) and similarly for \({u}_{{target}}\), \({v}_{{target}}\). \({{{\mathcal{F}}}}\left\{{w}_{{out}}\right\}\left(u,v\right)\) is the 2D Fourier transform of \({w}_{{out}}\left(x,y\right)\) evaluated at \(\left(u,v\right)\). The first term within the curly brackets in Eq. (12) is intended to increase the output diffraction efficiency of the RFG, whereas the second term is intended to reduce the nonuniformity in the diffraction efficiencies observed for different illumination directions. The exponent \(\mu\) is a training hyperparameter, empirically set to 0.05. The hyperparameter \(\eta\) can be tweaked to tune the resulting diffraction efficiencies, as shown in Fig. 4.

For training the arbitrarily filtered and permuted RFG of Fig. 5, the following loss function was used:

where \(b=1\) for the unfiltered illumination directions and \(b=0\) for the filtered ones. For the unfiltered directions, mode purity \({{{\rm{MP}}}}\) is defined as:

For the filtered directions, the relative residual power \({{{\rm{RRP}}}}\) is defined as:

The minimum diffraction efficiency for the unfiltered directions \({{{{\rm{DE}}}}}_{\min }\) was set as 10%, whereas the maximum relative residual power for the filtered directions \({{{{\rm{RRP}}}}}_{\max }\) was set as 1%. The hyperparameters \({\eta }_{1}\), \({\eta }_{2}\) and \({\eta }_{3}\) determine the strength of different terms intended to enforce the diffraction efficiency to be above \({{{{\rm{DE}}}}}_{\min }\) while increasing the mode purity for the unfiltered directions as well as enforcing the relative residual power below \({{{{\rm{RRP}}}}}_{\max }\) for the filtered directions. We empirically set the values of these hyperparameters as \({\eta }_{1}={\eta }_{2}={\eta }_{3}=10\).

The optimizable features of an RFG design comprise the thickness variations \({h}_{l}\left(x,y\right)\) of the transmissive surfaces. The discretization interval for the RFG surfaces was \(\delta \approx 0.53\lambda\), i.e., \({h}_{l}\left(m,n\right)={h}_{l}\left(m\delta,n\delta \right)\). To limit the thickness variation to the maximum allowable value, \({h}_{\max }\), they are obtained from the latent trainable parameters \({\mu }_{l}\left(m,n\right)\) as follows.

We set \({h}_{\max }=\frac{\lambda }{n-1}\) to allow for a phase modulation depth of \(2\pi\). The latent variables \({\mu }_{l}\left(m,n\right)\) were initialized as zero at the beginning of the training.

For monochrome RFG designs reported in the manuscript, we assumed an operating wavelength of \(\lambda=0.75\,{{{\rm{mm}}}}\). For the negative refractive function generator, the input and output aperture width \({D}_{a}\) was 12 mm, whereas for the other examples, \({D}_{a}=8\,{{{\rm{mm}}}}\). For the experimental results reported in Figs. 8 and 9, \({\theta }_{\max }={30}^\circ\). For the ones reported in Fig. 10, \({\theta }_{\max }={4}^\circ\), whereas \({\theta }_{\max }={60}^\circ\) was used for the rest of the results. The refractive index of the assumed RFG material (the same as the one used for experimental demonstration) was 1.6518 at 0.75 mm wavelength.

For the wavelength multiplexing examples, the assumed wavelengths were \({\lambda }_{1}=0.70\,{{{\rm{mm}}}}\), \({\lambda }_{2}=0.75\,{{{\rm{mm}}}}\) and \({\lambda }_{3}=0.80\,{{{\rm{mm}}}}\), and the corresponding refractive indices were \(n\left({\lambda }_{1}\right)=1.6512\), \(n\left({\lambda }_{2}\right)=1.6518\) and \(n\left({\lambda }_{3}\right)=1.6524\). To clarify, the physical dimensions were fixed across wavelengths to ensure consistent device geometry: the aperture width was set to \({D}_{a}=8\,{{{\rm{mm}}}}\) and each diffractive surface was 80 mm wide with \(200\times 200\) optimizable phase elements. In each corresponding figure, spatial dimensions are expressed in units of the center wavelength \(({\lambda }_{2}=0.75\,{{{\rm{mm}}}})\) to facilitate comparison with other figures. For this wavelength multiplexing scheme, we set \({h}_{\max }={\max }_{i}\frac{{\lambda }_{i}}{n\left({\lambda }_{i}\right)-1}\) to ensure that a full \(2\pi\) phase modulation range is available at all the illumination wavelengths.

For the analysis of diffraction efficiency reported in Supplementary Fig. S11d, the grid of input and output directions is discretized at the diffraction-limited resolution \(\lambda /{D}_{a}\) and subsequently flattened into a one-dimensional grid—a process we refer to as “unrolling”; see Supplementary Fig. S11.

The transmissive surfaces were optimized using the Adam optimizer61 with a minibatch size of four and a learning rate of \({10}^{-3}\). We evaluated the mean loss of the trained model after the completion of each epoch and selected the trained model state at the end of the epoch corresponding to the lowest loss. The RFGs for negative refractive function were trained for 1000 epochs. The other RFG designs were trained for 6000 epochs, except for the ones reported in Supplementary Fig. S3, which were trained for 2000 epochs. The RFG models were implemented and trained using TensorFlow (version 2.4.1)62 with Python 3.8. The training time depends on several factors, including the number of diffractive surfaces and the availability of GPU acceleration. For example, training a negative refractive function generator with \({K}=\,5\) surfaces takes approximately 4 h on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU. The fabrication of a single diffractive surface takes approximately 1.5 h on a Stratasys Objet30 V2 Pro 3D printer; the overall time can be significantly reduced by printing multiple surfaces simultaneously on the same build tray.

The direction of the output wavefront \(\left({\theta }_{{out}},{\varphi }_{{out}}\right)\) was estimated by solving the following optimization problem to fit a uniform plane wave along \(\left({\theta }_{{out}},{\varphi }_{{out}}\right)\) to \({w}_{{out}}\left(x,y\right)\) using a gradient descent algorithm:

where

The initial estimates for the optimization cycles, i.e., \({\theta }_{{init}}\) and \({\varphi }_{{init}}\), were derived from the Fourier transform of the output wavefront \({{{\mathcal{F}}}}\left\{{w}_{{out}}\right\}\) as follows:

The angular error \(\varepsilon\) between the output direction and the target direction was evaluated as follows:

where \({\hat{k}}_{{out}}\) and \({\hat{k}}_{{target}}\) are calculated from the corresponding \(\theta\) and \(\varphi\) values using Eq. (1), and \({\hat{k}}_{{out}}\cdot {\hat{k}}_{{target}}\) refers to their scalar product.

A modular amplifier (Virginia Diode Inc. WR9.0 M SGX) with multiplier chain (Virginia Diode Inc. WR4.3×2 WR2.2 × 2) and a compatible WR2.2 diagonal horn antenna from Virginia Diodes Inc. were used to generate continuous-wave radiation at 0.4 THz. This was accomplished by amplifying a 10 dBm RF input signal at \({f}_{{{{\rm{RF}}}}1}\,=\,11.1111\,{{{\rm{GHz}}}}\) and multiplying it 36 times. To ensure low-noise data acquisition via lock-in detection, the AMC output was modulated at \({f}_{{{{\rm{MOD}}}}}\,=\,1\,{{{\rm{kHz}}}}\). The horn antenna's exit aperture was positioned at ~60 cm from the input aperture of the 3D-printed RFG so that the input THz wavefront was approximately planar. We used a Stratasys Objet30 V2 Pro printer for the 3D fabrication of the resulting RFG design. A single-pixel mixer from Virginia Diodes Inc. detected the diffracted THz radiation at ~80 mm away from the output aperture. The detected signal was down-converted to 1 GHz using a 10 dBm local oscillator signal at \({f}_{{{{\rm{RF}}}}1}\,=\,11.0833\,{{{\rm{GHz}}}}\) fed into the mixer. The mixer, mounted on an X-Y positioning stage with two motorized linear stages (Thorlabs NRT100), scanned the output FOV using a 0.5 × 0.25 mm detector with 2 mm intervals. The down-converted signal was amplified by 40 dB using cascaded low-noise amplifiers (Mini-Circuits ZRL-1150-LN+), and unwanted noise was filtered out with a 1 GHz (+/−10 MHz) bandpass filter (KL Electronics 3C40-1000/T10-O/O). After measuring by a low-noise power detector (Mini-Circuits ZX47-60), the output voltage was then measured with a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research SR830), using the \({f}_{{{{\rm{MOD}}}}}\,=\,1\,{{{\rm{kHz}}}}\) modulation signal as a reference, and the amplifier readings were converted to linear scale. While estimating the output wave directions from the experimentally measured intensity patterns (see Supplementary Fig. S1b), only \(5\times 5\) pixels around the peak intensity was taken into account in calculating the first moment.

PIEZO1, a mechanosensor in endothelial cells, plays a critical role in fetal vascular development during embryogenesis. However, its expression and function in placental trophoblasts remain unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that PIEZO1 is expressed in placental villus trophoblasts, where it is essential for trophoblast fusion and placental development. Mice with trophoblast-specific PIEZO1 knockout exhibit embryonic lethality without obvious vascular defects. Instead, PIEZO1 deficiency disrupts the formation of the syncytiotrophoblast layer in the placenta. Mechanistically, PIEZO1-mediated calcium influx activates TMEM16F lipid scramblase, facilitating the externalization of phosphatidylserine, a key “fuse-me” signal for trophoblast fusion. These findings reveal PIEZO1 as a crucial mechanosensor in trophoblasts and highlight its essential role in regulating trophoblast fusion and placental development, expanding our understanding of PIEZO1's functions beyond endothelial cells during pregnancy.

Mechanical forces are essential regulators of embryonic development, shaping processes from gastrulation to organogenesis1,2,3,4. In contrast, mechanobiology of the placenta, a vital yet understudied organ5, remains poorly defined. During pregnancy, the placenta undergoes profound mechanical adaptations, including trophoblast migration, decidual invasion, syncytialization (trophoblast fusion), villous morphogenesis, and spiral artery remodeling1,6,7,8. While mechanical cues drive these processes, the molecular sensors transducing forces into biochemical signals in trophoblasts remain elusive.

PIEZO1, a mechanosensitive ion channel9,10, has emerged as a key force transducer in development. Constitutive PIEZO1 knockout (KO) mice are embryonically lethal, exhibiting severe defects in fetal angiogenesis11,12. Similarly, endothelial-specific deletion of PIEZO1 recapitulates this phenotype, underscoring its essential role in endothelial mechanotransduction. Beyond vascular development, PIEZO1 also regulates neural stem cell lineage specification13,14,15, osteogenesis16,17, and lymphangiogenesis18,19. However, despite trophoblasts being exposed to dynamic shear stress and/or compressive forces during gestation8, whether PIEZO1 mediates force sensing in trophoblasts remains unknown.

Here, we identify PIEZO1 as a mechanosensor in villous trophoblasts and demonstrate its essential role in trophoblast fusion and placental development. By shifting the focus from endothelial cells to trophoblasts, this study reveals a previously unrecognized PIEZO1-dependent mechanotransduction pathway in trophoblasts, providing insights into the mechanical regulation of the placenta development and identifying potential therapeutic targets for pregnancy complications associated with placenta dysfunction.

Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that PIEZO1 is expressed in both single-nucleated cytotrophoblasts (CTB) and multi-nucleated syncytiotrophoblasts (STB) in human chorionic villi (Fig. 1A), as well as in the human placental trophoblast cell line, BeWo (Fig. 1B), and the human trophoblast stem cells (hTSCs) (Fig. S2A). Our qRT-PCR analysis further demonstrated that PIEZO1 not PIEZO2 mRNAs are expressed in BeWo cells (Fig. S3A). The Comparative Transcriptomic Placental Model Atlas20, PIEZO1 transcripts are highly expressed in various in vitro models of human trophoblasts, including BeWo, JAR, JEG3 and HTR8 trophoblast cell lines, as well as primary trophoblasts and hTSCs (Fig. S3B), further supporting PIEZO1 expression in human trophoblasts.

Pressure clamp electrophysiology recording elicited a mechanosensitive current from BeWo cells with a unitary conductance of 29.3 ± 1.8 pS (Fig. 1C–G), which aligns with the typical single channel conductance of PIEZO110,21. Yoda1, a PIEZO1 agonist, robustly increased intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), which can be attenuated by the PIEZO1 inhibitor, GsMTx4 (Fig. S1). Silencing PIEZO1 using siRNA not only markedly attenuated this mechanosensitive current from BeWo cells (Fig. 1E–G) and hTSCs (Fig. S2D–F) but also reduced Yoda1-induced [Ca2+]i increase in these cells (Fig. 1H, I for BeWo and S2B, C for hTSCs). Taken together, these results support that PIEZO1 is functionally expressed in human trophoblasts.

We previously reported that the TRPV4 ion channel is specifically expressed in human but not mouse trophoblasts, indicating differential expression profiles in trophoblasts from different species22. To determine whether Piezo1 is also expressed in mouse trophoblasts, we examined its protein expression in the mouse placenta utilizing the Piezo1-tdTomato reporter mice (Piezo1P1-tdT) in which tdTomato is covalently tagged to endogenous Piezo112. The td-Tomato signal was detected in the placental labyrinth where SynT-1 and SynT-2, two layers of STBs, are located23 (Fig. 1J). We found strong td-Tomato signal in SynT-2 and weaker signal in SynT-1 using antibodies for MCT1 and 4, which are two monocarboxylate transporters specific to SynT-1 and -222,24,25. Consistently, single-cell RNA sequencing of the mouse placenta from the Spatiotemporal Transcriptomic Atlas of Mouse Placenta (STAMP)26 also shows that Piezo1 (Fig. S4A, B) is highly expressed in SynT-2 STBs that specifically express the fusogenic gene Synb, but weakly expressed in SynT-1 STBs that specifically express another fusogenic gene Syna23 (Fig. S4C, D). Taken together, our qRT-PCR, immunostaining and functional analysis confirm that, unlike TRPV4, PIEZO1 is expressed in both human and mouse placental trophoblasts and predominantly localizes to SynT-2 STBs in the mouse labyrinth.

Piezo1 constitutive KO mice are embryonically lethal, a phenotype previously attributed to endothelial dysfunction and defective angiogenesis due to PIEZO1 deficiency11,12. To dissect the role of PIEZO1 in placental trophoblasts, we generated a trophoblast-specific knockout (cKO) of Piezo1 mice by breeding Piezo1f/f27 with Elf5-Cre (Fig. 2A), a transgenic mouse line that specifically drives Cre recombinase expression in the trophectoderm as early as embryonic day 4.5 (E4.5)28. The heterozygous mice (HET) were born at near-Mendelian ratios (Fig. 2B) and exhibited no signs of embryonic lethality or developmental abnormalities, indicating that this breeding scheme did to lead to haploinsufficiency. On the other hand, nearly all cKO embryos died during pregnancy, with only 1 out of 105 (<1%) cKO mice surviving after birth (Fig. 2B, right). This drastically deviates from the anticipated Mendelian ratio of 25% for cKO mice (Fig. 2B, left). Morphologically, the cKO embryos and placentas were markedly smaller compared to their litter mates; some even showed signs of degradation and resorption (Fig. 2C and S5), suggesting that cKO mice suffer from intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and stillbirth. Embryonic death of Piezo1 trophoblast cKO mice starts as early as E11.5 (Fig. S5A).

B Genotype distribution of wild-type (WT), heterozygous (HET), and cKO pups compared to the expected Mendelian inheritance ratio. The numbers of animals with specific genotypes over 105 pups were shown in the parentheses. C Representative embryos and placentas from Piezo1 WT, HET, and cKO mice at embryonic day 13.0 (E13.0). Images of the complete litter can be found in Fig. S5B.

We conducted histological analysis to identify the defects in the cKO placenta. H&E staining demonstrated that E13.0 cKO placentas had markedly enlarged maternal blood sinuses in the labyrinth compared to those in WT placentas from the same litter (Fig. S6, red asterisks). Interestingly, the numbers of fetal capillaries, which were identified by nucleated fetal red blood cells (RBCs), did not show an obvious difference between WT and cKO placentas (Fig. S6, blue stars). Our CD31 staining of WT and cKO placentas further supports that trophoblast-specific deletion of Piezo1 does not significantly impact fetoplacental blood vessel development (Fig. 3A, B). This is distinct from the severe angiogenesis defects observed in the constitutive Piezo1 KO and the endothelial-specific Piezo1 cKO placentas11,12. Instead, our histological analysis suggests that defective trophoblast differentiation, rather than impaired angiogenesis, is the primary cause of embryonic lethality in trophoblast-specific Piezo1 cKO mice.

Defects in trophoblast fusion, a crucial step of trophoblast differentiation, are a major contributor to placental insufficiency, IUGR, and in severe cases, stillbirth29,30,31. To evaluate STB formation in the cKO labyrinth, we stained MCT1 and MCT4, markers of the SynT-1 and SynT-2 STBs, respectively22,24,25. In stark contrast to the smooth, uniform, and colocalized MCT1 and MCT4 staining in WT labyrinth, MCT4 expression was dramatically reduced, and in some regions, entirely absent in the Piezo1 cKO labyrinth. Although MCT1 staining was largely preserved, it exhibited a more irregular, zigzag pattern (Fig. 3C, D). These findings indicate that trophoblast-specific deletion of Piezo1 severely disrupts the formation of the SynT-2 STB layer while having a milder effect on the SynT-1 STB layer, consistent with Piezo1's expression profile in these STB layers (Figs. 1J and S4).

To further confirm the essential role of PIEZO1 in trophoblast fusion, we pharmacologically and genetically manipulated PIEZO1 in BeWo cells and quantified its effects on forskolin-induced BeWo cell fusion in vitro. Inhibition of PIEZO1 with GsMTx4 abolished BeWo cell fusion (Fig. 4A, B). Similarly, PIEZO1 knockdown via siRNA significantly reduced the fusion index (Fig. 4C, D). Conversely, PIEZO1 overexpression significantly increased PIEZO1 current (Fig. S7) and enhanced BeWo cell fusion index from 0.42 ± 0.03 to 0.65 ± 0.02 (Fig. 4E, F). Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is specifically secreted by STBs32. Using hCG as a biomarker of trophoblast fusion22,33,34, we found that GsMTx4 treatment significantly reduced hCG secretion from hTSCs after inducing differentiation (Fig. S8), further supporting that PIEZO1 plays an important role in regulating trophoblast fusion. Taken together, our in vitro experiments in human trophoblast models thus support our in vivo findings in the mouse placenta, confirming that PIEZO1 is a critical regulator for trophoblast fusion.

We previously reported that TMEM16F, a Ca2+-activated phospholipid scramblase (CaPLSase), plays a critical role in trophoblast fusion and placental development by mediating the externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS), an essential ‘fuse-me' signal for cell fusion24,35. Subsequently, we demonstrated that Ca2+ influx through Ca2+ permeable channels such as TRPV4 can activate TMEM16F, and the functional coupling between TRPV4 and TMEM16F modulates trophoblast fusion22. In our recent investigations of RBCs, we found that PIEZO1-mediated Ca2+ influx activates TMEM16F and enhanced PIEZO1-TMEM16F coupling contributes to the pathophysiology of RBC disorders such as hereditary xerocytosis36 and sickle cell disease37. Interestingly, Piezo1 and Tmem16f transcripts are both highly expressed in the SynT-2 layer (Fig. S4B–E), and the deficiency of either protein results in embryonic or perinatal lethality24 accompanied by severe defects in SynT-2 STB layer development (Figs. 2 and 3C, D). Based on these findings, we hypothesized that PIEZO1 and TMEM16F could be functionally coupled in trophoblasts and this coupling plays a key role in trophoblast fusion by regulating PS exposure.

To test this hypothesis, we employed a fluorescence imaging-based CaPLSase assay38 to investigate PIEZO1-TMEM16F coupling in BeWo cells. Treatment with 10 μM Yoda1 induced robust Ca²⁺ influx in both TMEM16F WT and KO BeWo cells (Fig. 5A). However, Yoda1-induced PS exposure was observed only in WT but not KO cells (Fig. 5A, B), indicating that Ca2+ influx through PIEZO1 can mediate TMEM16F-dependent PS exposure. On the other hand, gene silencing or GsMTx4 inhibition of PIEZO1 abolished both Yoda1-induced Ca2+ elevation and PS exposure in BeWo cells (Fig. 5C, D and S9). These findings demonstrate that PIEZO1 and TMEM16F are functionally coupled to regulate PS exposure in trophoblasts (Fig. 5G).

As Yoda1 is not a physiological activator of PIEZO1, we next examined whether mechanical forces could directly trigger PIEZO1-TMEM16F coupling in BeWo cells. We leveraged TMEM16F's moonlighting function as a Ca2+-activated ion channel39 and applied a −50 mmHg suction to a cell-attached membrane patch using a pressure clamp device. This mechanical stimulation elicited a time- and voltage-dependent, outward-rectifying current, a biophysical hallmark of TMEM16F current (Fig. S10A, B). Notably, this force-induced TMEM16F current depends on extracellular Ca2+ and requires the expression of both PIEZO1 and TMEM16F in BeWo cells (Fig. S10C), providing direct evidence that mechanical forces can directly activate PIEZO1-TMEM16F coupling in trophoblasts (Fig. 5G).

To examine whether PIEZO1-TMEM16F functional coupling directly regulates trophoblast fusion, we overexpressed PIEZO1 in TMEM16F KO BeWo cells and quantified forskolin-induced fusion. While PIEZO1 overexpression robustly enhanced fusion in WT BeWo cells (Fig. 4E, F), it failed to rescue the fusion deficit in TMEM16F KO cells (Fig. 5E, F). Our pressure clamp electrophysiology confirmed comparable PIEZO1 channel activity in WT and TMEM16F KO cells (Fig. S11), ruling out differential PIEZO1 expression or function as confounding factors. These results establish that PIEZO1's pro-fusogenic role depends on TMEM16F, likely through TMEM16F-mediated PS exposure, a “fuse-me” signal required for trophoblast fusion22,24. This functional coupling defines a mechanochemical axis where PIEZO1 senses mechanical cues and TMEM16F executes downstream biochemical signaling via PS externalization (Fig. 5G).

Our identification of PIEZO1 as a key regulator of trophoblast fusion expands its known functions in mechanobiology and development. Complementary to previous studies showing PIEZO1's critical role in fetoplacental angiogenesis and embryonic development11,12,40,41,42, our findings reveal that PIEZO1 in trophoblasts is also essential for embryonic survival. By manipulating PIEZO1 activity, our experiments demonstrate that mechanical forces play a pivotal role in driving trophoblast fusion during placental development.

Unlike endothelial PIEZO1, which responds to shear stress from blood flow43,44, CTB-to-STB fusion mainly occurs at the basolateral side of STBs (Fig. 5G), distant from maternal and fetal circulation. This suggests that blood flow-induced shear forces are less likely to activate PIEZO1 at the fusogenic CTB-STB interface. Instead, trophoblasts may rely on local compressive forces at the fusogenic synapses45, similar to those observed in myoblast fusion46,47, to trigger PIEZO1 activation. Future investigation of these intrinsic mechanical cues will be crucial for understanding how PIEZO1 regulates trophoblast fusion.

Our in vitro experiments further demonstrate that PIEZO1-mediated Ca²⁺ influx activates TMEM16F, leading to surface exposure of PS, an essential ‘fuse-me' signal required for trophoblast fusion24. Notably, both PIEZO1 and TMEM16F are highly expressed in the SynT-2 layer (Fig. S4), and loss of either protein in trophoblasts severely disrupts the development of this STB layer, further supporting the importance of PIEZO1-TMEM16F coupling in trophoblast fusion (Fig. 5G). Beyond promoting TMEM16F-mediated PS externalization, PIEZO1-mediated Ca²⁺ influx may also activate additional signaling pathways that influence trophoblast gene expression, migration, and proliferation, processes that collectively impact trophoblast fusion, placental maturation, and overall embryonic development. All of these require future systematic investigations, both in vitro and in vivo using various approaches, such as live cell imaging and histological analysis including electron microscopy, at different placental developmental stages.

By identifying PIEZO1 as a crucial mechanosensitive ion channel in trophoblasts, our study lays a foundation for further exploration of trophoblast mechanobiology in placental physiology and pregnancy complications. Given the central role of trophoblast fusion in placental functions, dysregulation of PIEZO1 may contribute to pregnancy disorders such as preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, and placental abruption. Future studies targeting PIEZO1 and its downstream pathways may offer therapeutic opportunities for managing these pregnancy-related complications.

It is noteworthy that PIEZO1 is broadly expressed in mouse and human placentas, not only in trophoblasts but also in endothelial cells, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and various immune cell types (Figs. S4 and 12). This widespread expression suggests that the embryonic lethality observed in global Piezo1 knockout mice, which occurs between E9.5 and E14.511,12, likely stems from cumulative dysfunction across multiple cell lineages. Supporting this idea, our data show that trophoblast-specific Piezo1 cKO embryos exhibit lethality as early as E11.5, closely phenocopying the global Piezo1 knockout mice. Interestingly, while endothelial-specific Piezo1 cKO mice display similar vascular defects as global Piezo1knockout mice, there are discrepancies in the timing of lethality, with both midgestation and perinatal lethality reported11,12,19. This further supports the notion that the embryonic lethality observed in global Piezo1 knockout mice likely results from the combined loss of Piezo1 function across multiple cell types. In addition, the role of PIEZO1 in various placental cell types in the context of pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia, preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), premature rupture of membranes (PROM), and placental abruption, remains an important area for future investigation. In summary, our findings on PIEZO1's role in trophoblast fusion and placental development provide new insights into placental mechanobiology and lay the groundwork for developing novel therapeutic strategies to treat pregnancy complications.

Human placental tissues were obtained under institutional review board approval (IRB# PRO00014627 and XHEC-C-2018-089), with a waiver of consent, to procure de-identified samples exclusively for research purposes. Placental specimens were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, #15710) at 4 °C for 48 h. Following fixation, the tissues were preserved in 70% ethanol for 3 to 5 days and subsequently processed using a 4-h protocol on the Leica ASP6025 tissue processor (Leica Biosystems). Processed tissues were paraffin-embedded using the HistoCore Arcadia system (Leica Biosystems) and sectioned at 5 μm thickness with a Leica RM2255 microtome (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) for histological examination.

For analysis, tissue sections were de-paraffinized at 60 °C, followed by two washes in xylene (Fisher Chemical, #X5S-4), and then rehydrated through a graded ethanol series (100%, 95%, and 70%). Sections were rinsed in MilliQ water for 5 min. Antigen retrieval was performed, after which tissue slices were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 and blocked with 10% goat serum prior to antibody incubation. PIEZO1 antibody (Proteintech, #82625-4-RR) was applied at a 1:200 dilution and incubated overnight. Fluorescent labeling was achieved using Alexa Fluor 488 fluorescence systems (Molecular Probes, #35552).

PIEZO1-floxed27 mice (B6.Cg-Piezo1tm2.1Apat/J, Strain #:029213) and Piezo1P1-tdT12 mice (B6;129-Piezo1tm1.1Apat/J, Strain #:029214) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory or a kind gift from Bailong Xiao. To generate trophoblast-specific PIEZO1 knockout mice, PIEZO1flox/flox mice were crossed with Elf5-Cre mice28. Genotyping was performed via PCR using DNA extracted from tail samples. Genomic DNA was extracted using an alkaline lysis method and PCR performed with GoTaq® Master Mix (Promega, #M7122). Amplified products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. All mouse handling and experimental procedures were conducted in strict accordance with the protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Duke University (#A057-24-02) and complied with National Institutes of Health guidelines. Animals were housed at a constant 24 °C in a 12 h light–dark cycle (lights on at 7:00 AM) with ad libitum access to food and water.

The wildtype BeWo cell line was authenticated by the Duke University Cell Culture Facility and the TMEM16F knockout (KO) BeWo cell line was generated by sgRNAs targeting exon 2, as previously reported22,24. BeWo cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Hams F12 (DMEM/F12) medium (Gibco, #11320-033) in a 5% CO2-95% air incubator at 37 °C. The media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma-Aldrich, #F2442) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, #15-140-122). The human trophoblast stem cell (hTSC) line CT29 was a generous gift from Dr. Danny Schust. Cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% FBS, 0.5% Penicillin-Streptomycin, 0.3% BSA, 1% ITS-X supplement, 1.5 μg/ml L-ascorbic acid, 50 ng/ml EGF, 2 μM CHIR99021, 0.5 μM A83-01, 1 μM SB431542, 0.8 mM VPA, and 5 μM Y2763248. Cells were seeded on tissue culture plates precoated with 5 μg/ml Collagen IV (Corning, #354233) for 2 h at 37 °C. Culture medium was replaced every two days and cells were passaged at ~80% confluence using TrypLE Express Enzyme (Gibco, #12604-021).

BeWo cells were transfected with PIEZO1 SMARTPool siRNAs (Horizon, # M-020870-00-0005) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen, #13778075) following the manufacturer's instructions. One day after siRNA transfection, the cells were switched to fresh medium and further cultured for another 24 h before confocal imaging or fusion experiments.

Total RNA was extracted using RNA isolator Reagent (Vazyme, #R401), quantified via NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific), and reverse-transcribed (500 ng input) with HiScript IV All-in-One Ultra RT SuperMix (Vazyme, #R433-01) to generate cDNA. qRT-PCR was performed using Taq Pro Universal SYBR Master Mix (Vazyme, #Q712-03) on a QuantStudio 6 Pro system (Thermo Scientific) under the following conditions: 95 °C for 30 s (initial denaturation); 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 60 °C for 30 s, with fluorescence acquisition during extension. Reactions were run in duplicate, and gene expression was normalized to GAPDH. All primer sequences are provided below. Human GAPDH primers: Forward 5'- ACAACTTTGGTATCGTGGAAGG −3'.

The procedures were done as previously described22,24. Briefly, to detect calcium dynamics, BeWo cells were treated with 1 μM Calbryte 590 AM (AAT Bioquest, #20700) for 10 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. PS exposure was detected using 500 ng/ml CF 488-tagged AnV (Biotium, #29005). 10 µM Yoda1 (Cayman Chemical, #21904) and 5 µM GsMTx4 (MedChemExpress, #HY-P1410) were used to stimulate and inhibit PIEZO1 activity, respectively. Time-lapse imaging of BeWo cells was conducted before and after Yoda1 stimulation at room temperature using a Zeiss 780 inverted confocal microscope or an Olympus IX83 inverted epi-fluorescent microscope. ImageJ and a custom MATLAB code were used to quantify cytosolic calcium and AnV binding24.

After BeWo cells were seeded on poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich)-coated coverslip for one day, cells were treated with 30 μM forskolin (Cell Signaling Technology, #3828 s) for 48 h to induce cell fusion. The forskolin-containing media was changed every 24 h. After forskolin treatment, cells were stained with Hoechst (Invitrogen, #H3570, 1:2000) and Wheat Germ Agglutinin Alexa Fluor-488 Conjugate (Invitrogen, #W11261, 1:1000) for 15 min to visualize nuclei and cell membranes, respectively. Six random fields of view were acquired using a Zeiss 780 inverted confocal microscope for each group. Cell fusion was quantified by calculating the fusion index as previously described22,24. To evaluate the effect of PIEZO1 inhibition on BeWo fusion, 5 µM GsMTx4 was co-applied with forskolin at the onset of fusion induction.

For hTSC differentiation into STB(2D)48, 1.5 × 10⁴ hTSCs were seeded into 48-well plates precoated with 2.5 μg/ml Collagen IV. Cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Penicillin-Streptomycin, 0.3% BSA, 1% ITS-X supplement, 2.5 μM Y27632, 2 μM forskolin, and 4% KSR. After 24 h, culture supernatants were collected and analyzed for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels using the Human hCG (intact) ELISA Kit (Sigma, #RAB0092), according to the manufacturer's instructions.

To overexpress PIEZO1, we utilize the lentiviral overexpression system as described previously49. Briefly, we designed lentiviral vectors based on Addgene plasmid #62554 where the puromycin resistance gene was replaced with a hygromycin resistance gene from the pSBtet-GH plasmid (Addgene #60498) and the TMEM16F/Ano6 gene was replaced with the hPIEZO1 sequence (Genebank AGH27891.1) followed by an IRES sequence. For empty vector controls, hPiezo1-IRES was removed. All subcloning was done using an In-Fusion Snap Assembly (Takara #638947). Lentiviral constructs of PIEZO1 were packaged into lentivirus by transfecting HEK-293T cells with lentiviral vectors, pMD2.G, and psPAX2 (Addgene #12259 and #12260) using Lipofectamine 2000. WT and TMEM16F KO BeWo cells were then transduced with the filtered lentiviral supernatant and polybrene (10 µg/ml) and selected with hygromycin.

Cells were fixed with 1% PFA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked with 5% goat serum in PBS for an hour. Coverslips were incubated in anti-PIEZO1 antibody (Proteintech, 15939-1-AP, 1:400) at 4 °C overnight. A secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 488 fluorescence system (Molecular Probes, #35552, 1:1000), was used for fluorescent staining. After staining nuclei with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), coverslips were mounted using ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant (Invitrogen, #P36961) and imaged with a Zeiss 780 inverted confocal microscope.

Mice were deeply anesthetized using isoflurane. Placentas and embryos were freshly collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, #15710) for 2 days at 4 °C and then transferred to 70% alcohol for 3 to 5 days before being processed by using a 4-h tissue processing setting with Leica ASP6025 (Leica Biosystems). Placentas were embedded in paraffin (HistoCore Arcadia H and Arcadia C, Leica Biosystems) immediately after the processing and then sectioned at 5 μm by using Leica RM2255 (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) for histological staining.

H&E staining was performed through deparaffinization at 60 °C followed by two washes with xylene (Fisher Chemical, #X5S-4) and a graded alcohol series (100%, 95%, 70%). The tissue was rinsed in MilliQ water for 5 min and then incubated in Hematoxylin 560 MX (Leica Biosystems, c#3801575) for 2 min, followed by rinsing with running water for 1 min. Tissue was dipped seven times in 0.3% ammonium hydroxide (Fisher Chemical, #A669S-500) and then rinsed in running water for 1 min. The tissue was incubated in 70% ethanol for 1 min followed by 10 dips in Alcoholic Eosin Y 515 (Leica Biosystems, #3801615). Dehydration was performed through an alcohol gradient of 95%, 100%, and twice in xylene, 1 min each. All slides were mounted using DPX Mounting Medium (Electron Microscopy Sciences, #13512). CD31 immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was performed by using rabbit polyclonal to CD31 (Abcam, #ab28364) with the Avidin/Biotin Blocking Kit (Vector Laboratories Inc., #SP-2001), VECTASTAIN Elite ABC HRP Kit (Peroxidase, Standard) (Vector Laboratories Inc., #PK-6100), and VECTOR VIP Peroxidase (HRP) Substrate Kit (Vector Laboratories Inc., #SK-4600). Nuclei were counterstained with VECTOR Methyl Green (Vector Laboratories Inc., #H-3402-500). Microscopic imaging of histology samples was taken at 20X by using an Olympus microscope (BX63l, Olympus, Center Valley, PA) with cellSens Dimension software.

Immunofluorescence staining against MCT1 and MCT4 was performed on TMEM16F WT and KO placenta by using MCT1 antibody (Millipore-Sigma, #AB1286-I), which stains the fused SynT-1 layer facing the maternal blood sinuses, and MCT4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., #sc-376140), which stains the fused SynT-2 layer facing the fetal blood vessels. Immunofluorescence staining were imaged with a Zeiss 780 inverted confocal microscope.

The reference clustering and individual single-cell RNAseq UMAP results were obtained from the Spatiaotemporal Transcriptomic Atlas of Mouse Placenta (STAMP, https://db.cngb.org/stomics/stamp/)26.

All ionic currents were recorded in the cell-attach configuration using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices) and the pClamp software package (Molecular Devices). Glass pipettes were pulled from borosilicate capillaries (Sutter Instruments) and fire-polished using a microforge (Narishge) with a resistance of 2−3 MΩ for macroscopic current and 5−7 MΩ for single channel recordings. The bath solution consisted of the following (in mM): 140 CsCl, 10 HEPES, and 5 EGTA, with the pH adjusted to 7.4 using CsOH. For PIEZO1 experiments, the pipette solution contained (in mM): 140 CsCl, 10 HEPES, and 1 MgCl₂, with the pH adjusted to 7.4 using CsOH. PIEZO1 activation was achieved by applying pressure using a high-speed pressure clamp (ALA Scientific Instruments, #HSPC-2-SB). Pressure was applied using a step protocol starting from 0 mmHg to −60 mmHg with −10 mmHg increments. In the PIEZO1-TMEM16F coupling experiments, the pipette solution contained (in mM): 140 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl₂, and either 0 or 2.5 mM Ca²⁺, as indicated. The pH was adjusted to 7.4 using CsOH. The pressure was maintained at a constant value of −50 mmHg during the recordings to activate PIEZO1 and enable Ca2+ influx. A voltage step protocol from −100 mV to +160 mV in 20 mV increments was used to elicit TMEM16F channel activation. Cs⁺-based solutions were used to suppress contaminating K⁺ current in BeWo cells.

All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software. Unpaired two-tailed Student's t-tests were used for single comparisons between two groups, while one-way ANOVA (with Tukey's multiple comparisons test) was used for multiple comparisons. Sample number (n) values are provided in the figure legends. All data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (s.e.m.).

Amazon has acquired Bee, a relatively new AI company that debuted an always-listening wearable earlier this year. Bee cofounder Maria de Lourdes Zollo shared the news via LinkedIn.

We covered Bee AI at CES 2025—it was one of many new wearables that promised to listen to everything around you. It didn't save audio recordings, but it used the power of third-party and in-house large language models to transcribe words and create a journal of sorts, offering insights into your day, crafting takeaways, actionable tasks, and summaries of conversations.

Despite being one of the first on the scene with its Alexa voice assistant, Amazon has been trailing behind the likes of OpenAI and Google's Gemini in the AI space, only recently debuting the upgraded version of Alexa+, powered by LLMs. The Bee acquisition would let Amazon offer its customers a different kind of AI experience from Alexa, one that is with you wherever you are and is always listening. That raises several privacy concerns, and Amazon has historically had a poor track record on that front.

We'll have to wait and see whether Bee's current privacy policies will shift under the new ownership, and what will become of the little yellow wearable.

Nothing's sub-brand CMF has a new smartwatch, following up on last year's Watch Pro 2. It's called the Watch 3 Pro, which is a subtle shift in the naming convention that makes it more similar to the CMF Phone 2 Pro that debuted a few months ago. The price is also now $99. Even with the $30 price bump, it's still one of the cheapest smartwatches around, though it runs RTOS (real-time operating system), meaning you won't be able to access your favorite apps here.

That trade-off lets the Watch 3 Pro purportedly last 13 days on a single charge, a slight bump over its predecessor (the new watch lasts 4.5 days if you have the always-on display enabled). There's a new dual-band GPS for more accurate route tracking, 131 sport modes with a personalized running coach, and a new heart-rate sensor that CMF claims is more accurate across workout intensities and skin tones. Naturally, there's a dose of “AI-powered” post-workout summaries.

The CMF Watch 3 Pro can now track blood oxygen levels and stress, and it offers guided breathing exercises to help you relax. It even has period tracking. That's almost all the typical health features found on more full-featured smartwatches, save the electrocardiogram and fall detection. You'll be able to see basic notifications on the watch, and there's now a ChatGPT integration that lets you talk to the chatbot and set reminders, though your phone will need to be nearby for processing.

It's available in dark gray, light gray, and orange, with a metal body and soft-touch silicone straps. CMF says all of its smartwatches are now transitioning to the Nothing X app, the same app used to configure Nothing's audio products. There's support for Apple Health, Strava, and Google Health Connect, so your data will show up in those respective platforms. It officially went on sale July 22, though some regions will have to wait until later this year.

Microsoft has announced a new Surface Laptop with an integrated 5G cellular modem, which will use Verizon's 5G network. Although it looks nearly identical to the current Surface Laptop 13.8 (7th Edition), it uses a new “custom multi-layered laminate” material on the exterior rather than aluminum, which Microsoft says “allows radio signals to pass through without impacting performance,” according to the company's blog post. Microsoft also boasts that it has completely redesigned the Surface Laptop to “thoughtfully” and “strategically” integrate the antenna inside to reduce interference.

All the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:

The new device is targeted toward business users, but it's an interesting reversal to the severe lack of cellular laptops recently. Microsoft has been offering a 5G option of the 2-in-1 Surface Pro for a while now, but never a Surface Laptop. When 5G was first rolling out in 2019, laptops with integrated 5G cellular connections were starting to roll out, such as the Lenovo Yoga 5G in 2020. But interest died out pretty fast. Perhaps Covid killed the momentum, since people were at home with their stable Wi-Fi connections. Or maybe it was because the Qualcomm Snapdragon-powered laptops at that time really couldn't compete with Intel.

Interestingly, because it's an enterprise device, the Surface Laptop 5G is actually powered by an Intel Core Ultra Series 2 rather than Qualcomm's Snapdragon X. Microsoft may also be trying to preempt Apple's move into cellular MacBooks. It was reported late last year that Apple was exploring the idea, having acquired Intel's 5G modem business back in 2019.

The Surface Laptop 5G will be available starting on August 26, with a starting price of $1,800 for an Intel Core Ultra 5, 16 GB of RAM, and 256 GB of storage. —Luke Larsen

That's the question posed by Palmer Luckey this week. The pro-Trump tech entrepreneur has already stamped his footprint in the worlds of virtual reality through Oculus and military tech through Anduril, but a more conventional computer would be new ground for Luckey. He raised the provocative question at the Reindustrialize 2025 Summit earlier this week.

“I actually think Anduril could build computers in the United States,” he stated. “I've looked into it very, very deeply. I've had conversations with everyone you would need to do this. On the chip side, on the assembly side, on the manufacturing side. I know exactly how to do it, what it would cost, how long it would take.”

Luckey goes on to say that the only thing holding him back is that he hopes someone else does it first. He later posted the following question on X: “Would you buy a Made In America computer from Anduril for 20% more than Chinese-manufactured options from Apple?” At the time of writing, 64 percent of the over 77,000 responses said yes, while the rest said no.

Whether or not there will be Anduril laptops in the future isn't so interesting as the larger question of how much it would cost to build technology from the ground up without relying on foreign production. The way his question is stated implies that he doesn't just mean laptops that are assembled in the US, but actually devices where every component is made in the US. If we trust Luckey in his price estimation, that would mean a MacBook Air–like device would cost an extra $200. That's less than what analysts have said in the past, including one approximation that stated iPhones would cost at least 25 percent more due to increased labor costs alone. Others have put that estimate much higher—as high as $3,500 for an iPhone, or stated that it's altogether impossible due to supply chain limitations. —Luke Larsen

Google Photos officially rolled out a feature this week that lets you convert static images to videos using generative artificial intelligence. We first saw this capability on an Honor smartphone, but it's now becoming more widely available. Google says the feature is powered by its Veo 2 generative AI model. All you need to do is select the image from your gallery and choose “Subtle movements” or “I'm feeling lucky,” and it'll get animated into a six-second clip (of something that never happened).

That's not all that's new. The company is also adding a feature called Remix, which lets you convert existing photos into art styles, like anime, comics, and 3D animations (remember Prisma?). It'll be rolling out over the next few weeks. All of these effects and features might feel a little much, especially considering all the other tools at your disposal in the app, which is why Google also has a new Create tab. This is where you can go to convert photos to videos, use Remix, create collages, highlight videos, and more. The tab will be rolling out in August.

Google's Wear OS 6 update started rolling out this week—it's the latest version of the smartwatch operating system, introducing a more colorful interface, widgets that are even more glanceable, alongside power efficiency improvements for better battery life. One of the oldest watch face apps, Facer—which has hundreds of themed watch face designs across various platforms—has announced an update adding compatibility with Wear OS 6. That's big news, considering that the app lost compatibility after Wear OS 5 rolled out in 2024.

Facer didn't support Google's Watch Face Format (WFF) when Wear OS 5 launched, which was mandatory to access watch face complications. The company had to work with Google to bring back full functionality of its watch faces to Wear OS 6, and the it even says Facer will deliver “significantly improved battery life” on all faces.

The Facer update also adds new collaborations, like a SpongeBob SquarePants watch face, as well as a social component called “Looks.” It's a tab in the app that lets you show off your favorite watch faces. Think of it as a new way to discover watch faces outside of the app's general explore page. If you like a look, you can find out what watch face they're using and download it, and if you like their watch strap, Facer will point you to its own strap store so you can nab it.

Photo filter and editing app VSCO—yes, the very same that popularized the “VSCO girl”—has been around since 2012, but the company just launched a stand-alone mobile app after a decade. Capture is an iPhone-only camera app that has more than 50 “live presets” with real-time film effects and manual camera settings for better control over the final image. It essentially lets you preview the final look of your photo before you even hit the shutter button.

These presets are non-destructive, so you can still edit the original captured image later on if you decide to change things up. It supports RAW and ProRAW formats, has real-time effects like bloom, and can instantly sync with the VSCO app for additional edits or sharing. It's free to download now, and there's no word if an Android app will be available in the future.

Nemo's Osmo tents have long been WIRED favorites. The proprietary, hybrid Osmo fabric is a blend of nylon and polyester, with dual coatings (silicone on the outside, poly on the inside) that offer the weatherproofing of polyester with much of the durability of nylon. The Osmo Dagger we reviewed several years ago is still going strong.

Earlier this year Nemo revamped the entire Dagger Osmo tent to be fully Bluesign compliant (previously just the fabric was). It now offers slightly more headroom, thanks to a pole redesign. The new model is also $30 cheaper.

Nemo's Osmo fabric first arrived in 2022 after two years of research, development, and testing. Where most tents are either nylon or polyester, Osmo is a proprietary blend of both. Nemo's product development director, Gabriel Rosenbrien, told WIRED in that one of the company's goals with Osmo was to find a way to overcome the stretching of nylon (which absorbs water and sags), while also avoiding the downsides of polyester—namely, that it's not quite a strong as nylon.

This is bit of an oversimplification. Factors such as the coating used, the density and type of weave, and other design choices make comparing nylon and polyester something of an apples-to-oranges prospect. In general, both nylon and polyester have strengths and weaknesses. Osmo is Nemo's attempt to pull in the strengths of both while avoiding the weaknesses, and I think the company has succeeded.

I have spent 25 nights now in the previous model and a week in the new one, including one of the heaviest rains I've ever experienced, and I've found Osmo to be plenty durable and great at shedding the rain.

Coming in at just under 4 pounds, the Dagger is on the heavy side for what it is, but split between two people the weight is acceptable for what you get. This is an especially livable backcountry tent that's roomier than most.

At 88 inches long and 50 inches wide, there's just room for two 25-inch sleeping pads, something you won't pull off with most ultralight tents. Lengthwise, I had plenty of room without touching the ends with my bag hood or footbox. I'm 5' 11"", but anyone up to about 6'3"" would likely be fine. Another nice aspect is that the foot end of the tent doesn't taper inward, which means even at your feet your bag has almost no contact with the sides, making it easier to avoid any condensation.

There hasn't been much condensation in my experience, though. There's plenty of mesh at the top (which is also great for staring up at the stars on those clear nights when you don't need the fly), which allows for plenty of airflow. Even on some humid Midwestern nights, condensation coming off the rainfly was not an issue. The Osmo fabric's polyester content also ensures that the there is very little sag, even after wet nights.

Another aspect that makes the Dagger feel roomy are the very steep sidewalls, which are pretty much vertical thanks to the mid-center cross pole. As part of the 2025 redesign, the interior height is now 43 inches. This is the tallest freestanding tent that I'm aware of, beating the Big Agnes Copper Spur UL2 ($408), which tops out at 40 inches, and Nemo's Hornet 2P ($450) which, while lighter, is also only 40 inches tall.

Unchanged from last year is the nice, deep bathtub floor, which comes up about 6 inches, offering good protection from rain back-splash and any runoff from pitching your tent in the wrong place. If you're selecting your pitch site well, this shouldn't happen, but sometimes circumstances intervene and it's dark or you're the last person to the group site and don't have first pick.

If you look at the photos, you'll notice that the rainfly arcs up at each end of the tent. This saves a bit on weight and improves ventilation, but it was one area that worried me when I reviewed the 3-person version years ago. Thankfully this has never been an issue, the bathtub floor (which is what is exposed below the fly) has proved plenty waterproof in my use.

Speaking of bathtub floors, there is a clip-in vestibule floor that's also a bathtub shape. Nemo calls this the Landing Zone. It's a little extra triangle of fabric that covers about half the vestibule and protects any gear you've stored there from back-splash and any water that might come under the fly. There are stays in the rainfly to help it maintain its bathtub shape.

The Landing Zone weighs next to nothing (1.7 ounces) and makes the vestibule much more usable, keeping your gear dry even if the ground gets wet. It's a nice feature I've come to appreciate on rainy days.

What I really like about Nemo's tents over other options, like the Copper Spur tents, is the attention to detail. The Landing Zone, the ceiling headlamp pocket (which turn your headlight into a lantern, complete with reddish light), the quick clip fly attachment, the fact that the near vertical sidewalls mean the doors can use a straight zipper (which you can open with one hand), the nice hooks that allow you to roll the vestibule and inner doors out of the way … all adds up to a living experience that trumps most other tents I've tested.

There are a couple of trade-offs here. The big one is weight. This is not the tent for ultralight backpackers, thru-hikers, or anyone looking for a very low-weight, minimalist structure. If that's you, look to tarps and non-freestanding tents like the Lunar Solo. Again, though, split between two people, I think a 4-pound tent like the Dagger is perfectly acceptable.

The other trade-off: The Nemo is toward the high end of the price spectrum. In my experience, the combination of high quality materials, durability, and attention to detail make the Dagger Osmo 2P worth the investment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Texas Floods Were a Preview of What's to Come","https://www.wired.com/story/kerr-countys-tragic-flood-wasnt-an-outlier-it-was-a-preview/","Sat, 26 Jul 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

This story originally appeared on Grist and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

The country watched in horror as torrential rain drenched Texas earlier this month, sweeping at least 135 people to their death. Kerr County alone lost 107, including more than two dozen children at Camp Mystic.

From afar, it would be easy, even tempting, to think that floods like these could never happen to you. That the disaster is remote.

It's not.

As details of the tragedy have come into focus, the list of contributing factors has grown. Sudden downpours, driven by climate change. The lack of a comprehensive warning system to notify people that the Guadalupe River was rising rapidly. Rampant building in areas known to flood, coupled with  incomplete information about what places might be at risk.

These are the same elements that could trigger a Kerr County type of catastrophe in every state in the country. It's a reality that has played out numerous times already in recent years, with flooding in Vermont, Kentucky, North Carolina and elsewhere, leaving grief and billions of dollars in destruction in its wake.

“Kerr County is an extreme example of what's happening everywhere,” said Robert Freudenberg, vice president of energy and environmental programs at the Regional Plan Association. “People are at risk because of it, and there's more that we need to be doing.”

The most obvious problem is we keep building in areas prone to flooding. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, produces readily available maps showing high-risk locales. Yet, according to the latest data from the nonprofit climate research firm First Street Foundation, 7.9 million homes and other structures stand in a FEMA Special Flood Hazard Area, which designates a location with 1 percent or greater chance of being inundated in any given year.

Source: First Street Foundation

In Louisiana, a nation-leading 23 percent of properties are located in a FEMA flood zone. In Florida, it's about 17 percent. Arkansas, New Mexico, and Nebraska are perhaps less expected members of the top 10, as is New Jersey, which, with New York City, saw torrential rain and flooding that killed two people earlier this month.

Texas ranks seventh in the country, with about 800,000 properties, or roughly 6.5 percent of the state's total, sitting in a flood zone. Kerr County officials have limited authority to keep people from building in these areas, but even when governments have the ability to prevent risky building projects, they historically haven't. Although one study found that some areas are finally beginning to curb floodplain development, people keep building in perilous places.

“There's an innate draw to the water that we have, but we need to know where the limits are,” said Freudenberg. “In places that are really dangerous, we need to work toward getting people out of harm's way.”

Kerr County sits in a region known as Flash Flood Alley, and at least four cabins at Camp Mystic sat in an extremely hazardous “floodway.” Numerous others stood in the path of a 100-year flood. When the Christian summer camp for girls underwent an expansion in 2019, the owners built even more cabins in the water's path.

“It's an unwillingness to think about what the future—and the present—have in store for us,” said Rob Moore, director of the Water and Climate Team at the Natural Resources Defense Council, or NRDC, about Americans' tradition of floodplain development. ”It's a reluctance to own up to the reality we live in.”

Many people don't even know they are in harm's way. According to the NRDC, 14 states have no flood disclosure laws, and in eight they deem the laws “inadequate.” FEMA maps are also flawed. For one, they can be politically influenced, with homeowners and communities often lobbying to be excluded in order to avoid insurance mandates and potential building costs. And experts say the science underpinning the maps is lagging too.

FEMA “only maps main river channels and coastal storm surge areas,” explained Jeremy Porter, the head of climate implications research at First Street Foundation. The agency, he added, specifically doesn't model heavy rainfall, isn't great about indicating the risk of urban flooding, and is behind on accounting for climate change.

Source: First Street Foundation

First Street built a flood model that tries to fill in those gaps. It found that 17.7 million people are at risk of a 100-year flood, a number that's more than double what FEMA's hazard area covers.The state rankings also change, with mountainous areas susceptible to inland flash flooding jumping up the list. West Virginia moves into first, with a staggering 30 percent of properties built in flood-prone areas. Kentucky climbs from 19th to sixth.

Texas remains at seventh, but the portion of properties at risk goes to 15 percent. In Kerr County, FEMA's maps showed 2,560 properties (6.5 percent) in a flood zone. First Street's model nearly doubled that.

“There's a ton of unknown risk across the country,” said Porter, who says better maps are among the most important goals that policymakers can and should work toward. First Street has partnered with the real estate website Redfin to include climate risk metrics in its listings.

Rob Moore says political will is essential to making that type of systemic change when it comes to not only flooding, but other climate risks, such as wildfires or coastal erosion. Strengthening  building codes and restricting development in high-risk areas will require similar fortitude.

“Governments and states don't want to tell developers to not put things in a wetland, not put things in a floodplain,” he said. “We should be telling people don't put them in a flatland, don't build in a way that your home is going to be more susceptible to wildfire.”

Until then, hundreds of communities across the country could—and likely will—be the next Kerr County.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Do You Need a Barbecue Knife?","https://www.wired.com/story/do-you-need-a-barbecue-knife/","Sat, 26 Jul 2025 10:30:00 GMT","

A while back at my favorite kitchen-gear trade show, I spotted what appeared to be a trending category: barbecue knives. Their distinguishing characteristics seem to be a fairly tall blade, a shape that encourages a wokka-wokka–style rocking motion, and a target audience that skews heavily toward dudes with beards. Not all of those traits scream “great for grilling,” but I was intrigued.

One question immediately stuck in my head: What, if anything, makes a knife grill-friendly? Those I'd come across certainly had a look that blended pirate cutlasses and samurai swords, along with Japanese kitchen knives and occasionally Chinese cleavers. Ads with Guy Fieri look-alikes who were “blown away” by this “radical design” quickly began crufting up my social media feeds.

I sent a note off to my trusted knife guy, Bob Tate, at Bozeman Knife Sharpening & Supply to get his take on barbecue knives. He had just sharpened one for a client and found that it “looked like a cross between something Attila the Hun would use in battle and a zombie slayer.” This one in particular struck him as the product of celebrity chefs and knife designers who needed to justify their existences.

He clearly couldn't see the point, preferring to steer customers considering a set toward the famous trifecta of a chef's knife, paring knife, and bread knife.

“I tell them they'll be able to do 90 percent of everything they need to do and be way happier doing it 'cause they've got a superior product,” Tate says.

Though I didn't smell a rat, something felt just a little bit made up about this knife style, so I called a couple of them in for testing. First to arrive was the eight-inch Messermeister Avanta Kendrick BBQ Knife, with a swashbuckler vibe, a curved spine (the top of the blade), a handle that continued that arc upward, and the sides of the blade painted black. (If you need even more macho than all that, check out the video.)

The knife is a bit blade-heavy, a style that is not my jam, but it felt good to wield. Messermeister is a well-respected brand among both pro chefs and home cooks. Chad Ward, author of An Edge In The Kitchen, calls one of Messermeister's traditional nine-inch chef's knives “just about perfect.” This led to a bit of confusion as I got chopping, when my reaction started at “what the?” and proceeded to “ouch!”

A few things became clear as I chopped my way through piles of onions, carrots, herbs, and meat. First, the upward handle angle had peculiar effects on the knife's behavior. Imagine the grip you'd use on a “regular” knife, which is vaguely like shaking someone's hand. Now watch what your hand needs to do to accommodate an upward handle angle. It gets awkward kind of quickly, right?

First, it made me want to be taller, which is peculiar because I'm a smidge over six feet, and in kitchens I'm usually wishing for a higher countertop. Here, I wanted my cutting board a few inches lower to compensate for the knife. Plus the blade height, well over two inches high for most of its length, meant that using the tip to do delicate work was not really an option. Plus, in a reversal from the rocking motion the knife seems to be designed for, the handle angle encouraged me to use more of a push cut, more typically used with a knife like a santoku with very little curve to the edge. This got more peculiar when I held it up next to my existing knives and realized the big swoop of the blade was notably similar to my classic German chef's knife.

Unconsciously, this made me move my pinch grip—where the blade is held between the thumb and forefinger while the other three fingers stay on the handle—even further forward in order to get the knife to cut like I wanted it to. When I asked the folks at Messermeister specific questions about it, the company's executive vice president responded with a quote, more than half of which was marketing copy pulled directly from the Messermeister website.

He also mentioned European butchers and fishmongers, a “butcher's style blade,” a compact cleaver, mezzaluna, and a “ulu-style skinning knife.” It was some serious knife-dude word salad, but apparently I was covered from prep to flensing!

Did I mention the sharp corners on the top of the spine started giving me blisters?

In pleasant contrast, the other barbecue knife was a lot of fun. Schmidt Brothers Cutlery sent me the eight-inch Chef's BBQ Knife from its Zebra Wood 6-PieceBBQ BBQ Knife Set, a firmly middle-of-the road collection it sells through Costco and kitchen gear retailers. It is light, not too tall, with a gradual taper and dimples (aka kullens) along the sides that help keep food from sticking. It was a bit of a cross between a slicer and a santoku, particularly the latter's profile and the minimal swoop of the belly.

I was surprised at how much I enjoyed using it. I liked the rounded and slightly large grip and far more centered weighting. A butternut squash would max out this knife's capabilities, and it's certainly not made for skinning anything, but I still loved using it. Frankly, the whole “barbecue knife” concept is a little lost on me, but more than once I considered adding this knife to my own lineup.

What all this testing with two very different blades underscored was the importance of trying a knife out before committing to it. Messermeister isn't mistakenly making a blade-heavy knife; some people love that. I suppose you could cheat and order one online and ship it back if it doesn't work out, but swinging past a great knife shop will allow you to compare multiple styles and pay big dividends. (If you're in Bozeman, Montana, go see Bob Tate and tell him I said hello!)

A barbecue knife may be more of a hazy marketing idea than anything else, but they're not complete bunk, either. If you try one and like it and because of that enjoy cooking more, then that sounds like a great knife to me.

The future of self-driving cars in Italy it seems needs not only technology but also (possibly above all) political backing. The good news, then, is that more than 60 mayors in Italy have decided to take the field for the cars of the future.

On July 14, in the hall of the MEET Digital Culture Center in Milan, Pierfrancesco Maran, a member of the European Parliament for the Italian Democratic Party, launched the Autonomous Driving: Italy in the Front Row initiative, which has backing from administrators from all over the country.

Among the signatories to the scheme are Milan mayor Beppe Sala and Turin mayor Stefano Lo Russo, as well as dozens of other mayors of medium-size and small cities. The goal, apparently, is to make Italy the European leader in autonomous vehicles, turning municipal territories into open-air laboratories for testing the automotive technologies of the near future.

The initiative stems from the realization that Europe lags dramatically behind the United States and China. While Waymo fulfills more than 250,000 paid rides a week in the four US cities where it operates, and China has established 20 pilot cities with more than 74 million miles of accumulated testing, Europe is limited to 400 highly fragmented micro-projects—of which less than half are nationwide.

The gap is not only geographical. In the United States and China, private individuals and companies invest billions, while in Europe, public funds are dispersed over initiatives that are too small. Europe's regulatory fragmentation, with 27 different national frameworks (including differing traffic laws, for example), also makes it impossible to exploit any advantage of the region being a single continental market.

A Waymo self-driving vehicle in San Francisco.

Italian administrators see autonomous driving as a practical solution to everyday urban problems, such as last-mile urban logistics and reducing traffic and pollution in city centers. Extending the right to mobility for the elderly, disabled, and children is also a priority shared by many administrators in the country, as is the use of autonomous vehicles to better connect suburban areas poorly served by public transportation.

But the path to implementation in the region turns out to be more complex than initially imagined, with challenges that go far beyond the technical aspects. For example, the collective mayors' enthusiasm clashes with an inadequate regulatory framework. Italy's new highway code, approved in December 2024, with focuses on new rules for electric scooters, zero tolerance for those driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs, and phone use while driving, has missed an opportunity to bring Italy in line with modern times and positions the country as one of ""the last of the old century instead of the first of the new,"" according to Maran.

Insurance companies still do not cover self-driving cars for public service in Italy, while European approval procedures severely limit the number of vehicles a manufacturer can put on the market. Bureaucracy slows any experimentation: Even to test a simple delivery robot seems to require ""going to Mars,"" said Milan's councillor for mobility Arianna Censi.

The discussion at the Milan conference brought out different visions of the future of autonomous driving in Europe. Giorgio Gori, another European Parliament member for the Italian Democratic Party, stated that Europe risks repeating the same mistakes made with cloud computing and artificial intelligence, areas where the continent has lagged behind due to regulatory fragmentation and a lack of large corporate players. ""We're not good at manufacturing, but from a utilization and grounding perspective we would be great,"" Gori said, suggesting that perhaps Europe should focus on applying technologies developed elsewhere rather than trying to reign in global competition.

Benedetta Scuderi, a European Parliament member for the environmentally focused Italian Europa Verde party, rejects the idea of surrendering to the technological supremacy of the United States and China, and insisted on the need to find spaces where Europe can excel, identifying strategic niches in line with the continent's sustainability goals.

Baidu's driverless car service in Jiaxing, China.

""We need to think in both research and production where autonomous driving can create added value for Europe and Italy,"" he said, pointing out that non-European players are not necessarily looking in the direction of more efficient and less impactful mobility. The European strategy, according to Scuderi, must focus on development models that favor vehicle sharing over private ownership, countering the US trend toward individual car ownership.

The Italian mayors' call represents a bet on the future of European mobility that must come to terms with complex geopolitical realities. And the time challenge is crucial: As each month of delay widens the gap with competitors investing billions, Europe must decide whether to focus on technological self-sufficiency or on the smart integration of solutions developed elsewhere. Waymo operates more than 1,500 vehicles in four US cities, while Volkswagen Group's Moia operating in Hamburg and Munich in Germany (as well as in Austin, Texas) has only 100 autonomous vehicles for testing purposes.

Success will depend on turning the policy debate into concrete actions that involve public and private investment, simplify regulations, and convince citizens that autonomous driving is an opportunity and not a threat. The 60 Italian mayors who have signed on to this autonomous driving initiative show that this technology has some political backing. However, it should be noted that there are just under 8,000 Italian municipalities.

Maran feels that what is needed is the kind of quantum leap only a coordinated European strategy can guarantee. “This is not about technology that will arrive tomorrow,” he said, ""but about a revolution already underway that Europe cannot afford to suffer passively.""

The creators of the popular card game “Taco vs. Burrito” — dreamed up by a Seattle 7-year-old in 2018 — are exiting with a significant win.

Hot Taco Inc., the company behind the game, sold the “Taco vs. Burrito” assets to Wisconsin-based toy and game company PlayMonster, ending a run that started with a little boy and his mom talking about how to make a game during their walks to a coffee shop.

“It's been such a fun ride. It's kind of crazy to think back to it being an idea for my son, and then all of a sudden we've sold a million copies of the game,” Leslie Pierson told GeekWire this week as she recounted the journey she had with her son Alex, now a 15-year-old high schooler.

Pierson said she, her husband Mark Butler, and Alex have always been a big game family. From a young age, Alex liked to learn new games and talk about what he liked and what he didn't.

According to Pierson, her son knew he wanted to create a new game called “Taco vs. Burrito,” and he knew he wanted to launch it with a Kickstarter campaign. How to make and play it was determined over several months of conversations on their walks.

“I really did think it was just gonna be a chat about how a product gets made,” Pierson said. But after six months they were still playing paper iterations of the game, improving on it, and falling in love with it.

An inventor and serial entrepreneur, Pierson had experience in product development. She created GoodHangups and launched the magnetic poster-hanging product via Kickstarter before landing on “Shark Tank” and making a deal with Lori Greiner on that hit show.

But Pierson was not a game developer. She credits Alex with the inspiration and creation of the “Taco vs. Burrito” gameplay — and for coming up with something that quickly made $25,000 on Kickstarter.

Pierson was already a big believer in Amazon, where she was selling GoodHangups.

“The thing I love about Amazon is the fact that you don't have to have a warehouse, you don't have anything,” she said. “You can just get your product there and then sell it. You don't have a big team, you don't have to support a big retailer or anything like that.”

Alex's game sold out on the e-commerce site in a week and Pierson knew, “there's something here.” The game and the fact that it was made by a kid resonated with families and others who enjoyed the strategic play.

“We've sold over a million and a half games in the past six years, and it just became amazing to do,” Pierson said, noting that it was regularly a top-ranked offering in Amazon's games category.

But the time to sell became apparent.

Pierson said the sweet spot for any business she runs is the first five years, where she could still handle the surge in popularity and demand with the help of one other employee. Pierson wasn't interested in hiring a big team or developing new versions of the game to sell more products to existing customers. She was tired of getting ready for the holiday rush, or another Prime Day.

The uncertainty around President Trump's shifting tariff policies didn't help either.

“Every day, Trump wakes up and has a new idea of tariffs — it's gonna be this, it's gonna be this, it's gonna be this,” Pierson said. “And I was just like, ‘I'm done.' This isn't the phase I love. I surely don't love not knowing what the cost of something is.”

And Alex's passion as a teen had pivoted from card games to video games.

Pierson fielded pitches from a number of different companies, and called PlayMonster's the best, saying they really got the brand and had concepts for future versions of the game. Rather than hold onto a stake in “Taco vs. Burrito” with a royalty in perpetuity, they opted for more cash now. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

As they fold their cards on “Taco vs. Burrito,” Pierson takes pleasure in knowing they provided quality entertainment for families, away from phones and modern digital distractions. Board and card games always brought her family together, and she's glad it worked for others.

“It's been a really good experience,” Pierson said. “And I love that Alex had that experience of creating something, so that if he has an idea in the future, anything's possible.”

This week on the GeekWire Podcast, my guest is Brad Anderson — a former Microsoft corporate vice president who spent more than 17 years at the Redmond company. For nearly five years, he has been with Qualtrics, where he's president of products, user experience, engineering, and security.

I've known Brad for a while. In fact I've been a guest on two of his shows back when he was a leader in enterprise mobility and cloud technology at Microsoft, when it was all the rage for executives to have their own video shows. 

There was “Lunch Break with Brad Anderson,” where he drove his guests around the streets of Redmond in his Tesla. And there was “The Ship Room,” where he talked about the cloud transformation and played games with guests, challenging me to distinguish real startups from fake ones. 

Qualtrics, the experience management technology company, has dual headquarters in Seattle and Provo, Utah. Once publicly traded, it was acquired in a private equity deal in 2023.

For this week's show, I went to the Qualtrics Tower in Seattle to talk with Brad about how he thinks about building tech today, and how AI agents are changing the experiences the company creates and measures. He also discussed the importance of security in the AI era. (Qualtrics announced a key security milestone this week.)

In the final segment, I turned the tables on Brad with a game about cloud and AI terms called “Real or Ridiculous” (see below). Listen to the end to play along. 

But first, he reminded me about the random case of mistaken identity that brought us together in the first place, back in the day.

Listen to the episode to hear the story, and continue reading for highlights from his comments, edited for context and clarity. 

On the unprecedented pace of AI innovation: “My team sends out a summary of what changed in the last seven days every single Monday to the engineering team, because it's moving that fast. I've never seen anything like that.”

How AI is transforming customer feedback: “Worldwide right now, when someone starts a survey, the completion rate is 75%. … With our Gen AI enabled surveys, what we call conversational feedback, it increases to 83%. … When we ask the follow-up question, we get 30 times the number of words back in the second response. And so with generative AI, we've been able to increase the amount of data coming back by 10%, and double the quality.”

On AI's impact on engineering productivity: “What we're seeing right now is, Cursor is literally generating millions of lines of new code for us. Of course, it's AI generated, human-reviewed, human approved, human corrected. But 45% of all that code that's being generated, we're checking into the product.”

The changing shape of engineering organizations: “I think, as an industry, there will be fewer entry level [positions]. If a typical pyramid for an engineering organization is that 20%, 15% of their engineers are entry level, that probably goes down by 3% to 5% over the next couple years.”

On trust as the key to AI success: “If you ask yourself the question, who are going to be the organizations that are going to thrive in this world of AI, I would argue it's going to be the organizations that business leaders trust.”

On using AI to accelerate decision-making: “I've spent hours and hours inside of ChatGPT just asking questions such as, ‘Hey, if you were the president of a 1,500-person organization with revenue in the multiple billions … what would you do if you wanted to significantly increase the capabilities and the skill set of the engineering team in AI? … It may not have all the answers, but boy, it puts things in your mind, it gives you ideas.”

And here's the quiz that I gave Brad in the final segment, which I created with help from ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini. Listen to the show to hear the answers.

Are these cloud and AI buzzwords real industry terms, or just expertly crafted nonsense?

Real or ridiculous? Listen to the final segment to play along and hear the answers.

Tea, an app that allows women to post anonymous comments about men they've supposedly dated, announced Friday that it has suffered a data breach, with hackers gaining access to 72,000 images.

That number includes 13,000 selfies and photo IDs submitted for account verification, as well as 59,000 images from posts, comments, and direct messages, the company said. Tea also said that no emails or phone numbers were exposed, and that only users who signed up before February 2024 were affected.

“We have engaged third-party cybersecurity experts and are working around the clock to secure our systems,” the company said. “At this time, we have implemented additional security measures and have fixed the data issue.”

404 Media reported that 4chan users claimed to be sharing personal data and selfies from Tea after discovering an exposed database.

The hack comes after the Tea app seemed to achieve viral popularity this week. As of Saturday morning, it was still number one in the free app rankings in Apple's App Store.

U.S. insurance giant Allianz Life has confirmed to TechCrunch that hackers stole the personal information of the “majority” of its customers, financial professionals, and employees during a mid-July data breach.

When reached by TechCrunch, Allianz Life spokesperson Brett Weinberg confirmed the breach.

“On July 16, 2025, a malicious threat actor gained access to a third-party, cloud-based CRM system used by Allianz Life,” referring to a customer relationship management (CRM) database containing information on its customers. “The threat actor was able to obtain personally identifiable data related to the majority of Allianz Life's customers, financial professionals, and select Allianz Life employees, using a social engineering technique,” the spokesperson said.

The company disclosed the data breach on Saturday in a legally required filing with Maine's attorney general, but did not immediately provide a number of how many Allianz Life customers are affected. According to the spokesperson, Allianz Life has 1.4 million customers. Its parent company, Allianz, has more than 125 million customers worldwide.

Allianz Life said it notified the FBI, and added it had “no evidence” that any other systems on its network were compromised. 

The insurance giant would not say if it had received any communication from the hackers, such as a ransom note. The company also would not attribute the breach to a hacking group. 

Allianz Life is the latest company in the past month to have been hacked during a wave of data breaches targeting the wider insurance industry, including Aflac, a major provider of supplementary health insurance. Security researchers at Google said in June that they were “aware of multiple intrusions” across the insurance sector attributed to Scattered Spider, a collective of hackers and techniques that rely on social engineering techniques, such as deceptively calling and tricking helpdesks into granting them access to a company's network. 

Prior to targeting insurance companies, the Scattered Spider hackers were seen targeting the U.K. retail industry, as well as the aviation and transportation sectors, and are historically known for hacks targeting Silicon Valley technology giants.

Per the Maine filing, Allianz plans to begin notifying affected individuals around August 1.

A U.K. law requiring that pornography websites verify the age of their users took effect Friday.

The BBC reports that around 6,000 porn sites have said they will start verifying users' ages to comply with the Online Safety Act, although at least one major site was not requiring age checks as of Friday morning.

The law also requires that online platforms prevent children from being exposed to harmful content, which is why sites like Reddit, Bluesky, X, and Grindr have also begun asking users in the U.K. to verify their age through means including selfies or government-issued IDs.

This is just one of a number of new child protection laws that could normalize online age checks globally, according to Wired. The approach has been criticized by groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation as a threat to online privacy and anonymity — indeed, it's worth noting that in a recent breach of the dating safety app Tea, many of the affected images were selfies and digital IDs uploaded for account verification.

Some internet users may try to get around age checks by using fake IDs, selfies of video game characters, or VPNs.

GM's EVs have been on a roll lately. After selling just the Chevy Bolt for years, a wave of new models — now up to 17 fully electrified vehicles — has pushed the automaker into second place in the U.S. behind Tesla. 

How did it get there? With a little help from a Tesla veteran.

GM board member Jon McNeil was president of Tesla during the development and introduction of the Model 3, a crucial period of the company's growth. One of the things he credits for Tesla's success is how Elon Musk ran product meetings. 

“No slides was our first rule,” McNeil told the audience earlier this month at TC All Stage in Boston. “You have to be reviewing real product.”

Every week, senior leadership would sit down with product leaders to review their progress. The practice was inspired by an encounter Musk had with Steve Jobs, McNeil said. 

“There was this belief that I think is true: Steve Jobs didn't have a ton of time or patience for Elon in the early days. And early in the early days, Elon would try to chase Steve down at events and parties in Silicon Valley for advice. And Steve didn't like Elon, and so would often turn his back to him when he approached him. 

“But one night, Elon got lucky and said, ‘Steve, if you had one piece of advice for me as a young entrepreneur' — he had just just done PayPal and was joining the team at Tesla — ‘what would that be?' Steve said, ‘Elon, you're now in the hardware business, but the hardware business is a lot like the software business. If you want to be successful in business, you have to get one thing right, and that is, you have to have a perfect product. And if the product is beautiful, it will sell itself.”

Musk took that to heart, McNeil said, and the concept of a perfect product became central to product development at Tesla.

“The thing we were looking for first of all was surprise and delight. Like, are we doing something that is going to just make somebody go wow or laugh or have fun? 

“Crazy example of that is the fart button,” McNeil said, referring to a software button labeled “Emissions Testing Mode” that would simulate flatulence through the car's speakers. 

The company also prized minimalism, which on the software side meant keeping functions accessible in fewer than two taps on the screen. 

“It has to be a kind of a no brainer for the average user. Then we would double back the designer — the lead designer was always in the room — and then we would say, OK, Franz, now make it beautiful.”

Meetings like those, where the actual product was reviewed, not a mockup, helped preserve Tesla's culture as it grew, McNeil said. “You can imagine the culture that gets communicated when people are bringing their A game to the CEO every week. Because you're not going to bring your B game to the CEO — especially that CEO, because he's going to fire you,” he said.

“That keeps that company on a one-week cadence of innovation. Every week they're making progress because of the product reviews.”

McNeil left Tesla in early 2018. In 2022, he was added to the board at GM. 

“One of the things I'm most proud of is Mary Barra, CEO, and Mark Reuss, president, [who oversee] a 275,000 person, $200 billion revenue company, are running product reviews every week where there's no slides. You've got to see the real product [whether it's] hardware, software. If it's hardware, it's in the room. You're touching it. You're feeling it,” he said.

“That stuff is so powerful. And it's led to GMs introduction of 17 EVs, now the second best selling EVs in the country. Because they're just on product, every week.”

After spending the past week-plus in the headlines due to a seemingly inescapable social media scandal, data operations startup Astronomer is trying to shift the narrative with a tongue-in-cheek video starring actress and entrepreneur Gwyneth Paltrow.

Paltrow was, of course, previously married to Coldplay singer Chris Martin. And it was at a Coldplay concert in Massachusetts that the company's CEO Andy Byron and Chief People Officer Kristin Cabot were apparently caught dancing together on the “kiss cam.”

When Byron and Cabot (who are reportedly married to other people) awkwardly tried to hide from the camera, Martin joked, “Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy.”

Footage of the exchange exploded in popularity, ultimately leading both executives to resign from Astronomer. In announcing Byron's resignation, the company said, “Our leaders are expected to set the standard in both conduct and accountability, and recently, that standard was not met.”

Astronomer's statement also nodded at the fact that the company had suddenly become famous for reasons having nothing to do with its product: “While awareness of our company may have changed overnight, our product and our work for our customers have not.”

Its new marketing video has a similar message, attempting to refocus the conversation on Astronomer's technology, while winkingly acknowledging why that might be a challenge.

Paltrow kicks things off by introducing herself as someone who's been “hired on a very temporary basis to speak on behalf of the 300-plus employers at Astronomer.” She then promises to answer the “most common” questions asked about the company — but when the briefly glimpsed, half-typed questions are all about you-know-what, Paltrow remains cheerfully, and resolutely, on-message.

“We've been thrilled so many people have a newfound interest in data workflow automation,” she says. Paltrow even finds time to plug the company's upcoming conference before concluding, “We will now be returning to what we do best — delivering game-changing results for our customers.”

Everyone talks a good line about more powerful, expressive programming languages till they need to put in the work. Ten years effort to program like ten people the rest of your life? I'm 69 now, I can see how such an investment pays off.I moved to OCaml. Studying their library source code is the best intro ever to functional programming, but I felt your ""all the way"" pull and switched to Haskell. (Monads make explicit what a C program is doing anyway. Explicit means the compiler can better help. What it comes down to is making programming feel like thinking about algebra. This is only an advantage if one is receptive to the experience.)I'm about to commit to Lean 4 as ""going all the way"".

I moved to OCaml. Studying their library source code is the best intro ever to functional programming, but I felt your ""all the way"" pull and switched to Haskell.

This is only an advantage if one is receptive to the experience.)I'm about to commit to Lean 4 as ""going all the way"".

OCaml is immediate by default instead of lazy, and allows imperative code with side-effects. Both escape hatches from the pure FP world.So, performance is easier to reason about and you can interact with your side-effecty real world stuff without having to reorganize your whole program around the correct monad.Most of the time you want your loops to be higher order functions but once in awhile you want to just build a vector from a for loop. OCaml let's you do it without it being a whole intervention.

So my guess would be less that Haskell is not these things (nor couldn't it be) but rather that OCaml has had the external forces necessary to optimise for these things above all else.

That being said, Haskell is pretty nice as well but I'd pick OCaml for real world stuff.One thing that bothered me with both these languages is that people not fluent with FP could write code that isn't idiomatic at all. It's probably a bit harder to do in Haskell.

- Pragmatism: The ocaml community has a stronger focus on practical real projects. This is shown by the kind of packages available on the ecosystem and the way those packages are presented. (A number of Haskell packages I've tried to use often seen to be primarily intellectual pursuit with little documentation on actually using them).- Simplicity: Haskell does have some amazing features, but it has so many different ways to do things, so many compiler flags, code can look vastly different from one codebase to another. It's kind of the c++ of FP. Ocaml is definitely more cohesive in its approach.Tooling: last I used Haskell the whole ecosystem was pretty rough, with two package managers and a lot of complexity in just setting up a project. Ocaml is not at the level of rust or other modern languages, but is definitely a stop above I'd say.

Plus, though both languages allow defining new infix operators, ocaml coders are much more restrained about it than haskellers, and I hate having to figure out what >>>>$=<<< does when it shows up in code.

Edit: but in this case, apparently the book was written for a course at Cornell where they teach both functional and imperative programming using the same language.

Having worked on a code-base written in a lazy (Haskel-like) FPL where the architecture relied heavily on laziness, the least pleasant issue to deal with was sudden and obscure explosions in memory consumption.Which would of course have a big impact on performance so maybe this was your point also.

The main author Michael Clarkson also started a similar lecture series on Software Foundations using Rocq (Coq)[1]. Not sure if that's still updated though.[1]: https://github.com/clarksmr/sf-lectures

At San Diego Comic-Con, HBO Max unveiled a new trailer for the second season of DC Studios' series, Peacemaker, starring John Cena.

The brand-new Peacemaker trailer arrives two months after DC Studios teased fans with an initial teaser. In the teaser trailer, we saw Peacemaker being interrogated by Maxwell Lord (Sean Gunn), Guy Gardner (Nathan Fillion), and Hawk Girl (Isabela Merced). Peacemaker's cameo in Superman, DC Studios' summer blockbuster, highlights his role as DC Studios' resident anti-hero and serves as a connection between the original and rebooted cinematic universes. This unique position places him in an interesting limbo that the upcoming second season appears eager to explore.

Although the world may not recognize them as genuine heroes—likely overshadowed by the headline-grabbing heroism of Smallville's caped superhero—Peacemaker and his gang have a mountain of trouble ahead that they need to sort out. Mostly caused by Chris himself deciding to see how the other half lives… the other half being a whole other dimension where Peacemaker is a way more popular hero.

Key among those issues aside from that is Peacemaker's long-awaited confrontation with Rick Flag Sr. (Frank Grillo) on account of killing his son in The Suicide Squad and a confrontation with himself, literally, when the other Peacemaker discovers that Chris is mooching off of his life and dimension. That just goes to show that folks have to stop messing around with pocket universes. Listen to Mr. Terrific!

The forthcoming second season of Peacemaker was announced in February of 2022. At the time, and especially following the cataclysmic conclusion of Superman, its positioning as DC Studios' next big thing raises several questions about how it'll address what director, writer, and DC Studios head James Gunn will carry over from its first season and what won't. Fortunately, Gunn provided some insight into what fans can expect ahead of Peacemaker's second season and how its hero's pocket universe gate compares to Lex Luthor's.

“Lex's version is much jankier than the one in Peacemaker. The one in Peacemaker works better. What the whole season of Peacemaker revolves around is that,” Gunn told Entertainment Weekly.

He continued: “I think of Peacemaker as more of a high-concept story about one other world. It's more akin to Philip Roth's [1996 novel] The Counterlife than it is to the third Spider-Man movie [2021's No Way Home]… I love that movie, but it isn't about that. It isn't Deadpool & Wolverine. It's really a very simple, simple story about [Chris'] relationship to this one other world.”

Fans can look forward to finding out firsthand what lies in store when Peacemaker season two premieres on HBO Max on August 21.

Star Trek faces an uncertain future at the moment, as shows that helped define its streaming renaissance end one by one, and little is known about what lies on the horizon (especially thanks to current events in our own world). So it's perhaps fitting, then, that the one new show we do know is coming is all about welcoming a new generation back to Star Trek‘s fundamental ideals after a similar period of uncertainty: Starfleet Academy.

To close out today's packed Hall H panel at San Diego Comic-Con, Paramount released the first trailer for Star Trek: Starfleet Academy. Set in the 32nd century after the events of Star Trek: Discovery, the series will follow the first new class of cadets to enroll at the titular academy in San Francisco in over a century, as the Federation rebuilds and reconnects after the cataclysmic events of “The Burn” from Discovery‘s third season.

The new trailer, aside from being packed with references to all of Star Trek history (from Academy wing names to courses on figures like Captain Sisko), introduces us to a whole host of new and familiar faces as classes begin. The series will be led by Holly Hunter, who plays Nahla Ake, the captain of the U.S.S. Athena, a long-lived half-Lanthanite (the same humanoid species as Strange New Worlds‘ Commander Pelia, played by Carol Kane) who also serves as the Academy's chancellor.

Among the senior staff at the academy, she'll be joined by Discovery‘s Tig Notaro and Voyager‘s Robert Picardo, reprising their roles as Jett Reno and the Emergency Medical Hologram simply known as the Doctor, respectively—they'll also be joined in a guest star capacity by Discovery‘s Mary Wiseman and Oded Fehr as Sylvia Tilly and Admiral Vance, respectively. One new addition to the campus staff is Gina Yashere's Lura Thok, the Athena‘s first officer as well as Starfleet Academy's cadet master—fascinatingly, a half-Klingon, half-Jem'Hadar, the genetically engineered footsoldiers of the Dominion from Deep Space Nine.

Of course, an academy needs students, and Starfleet Academy will follow a whole host of new recruits making their way through training. Here's the rundown:

Even if Starfleet Academy is a school-set series, Star Trek still needs a baddie, and the show will have one in the form of Paul Giamatti, cheekily and mysteriously introduced at the end of the trailer. Giamatti plays Nus Braka, a seedy gang leader (and himself another half-Klingon, this time a Klingon/Tellarite hybrid) who has some ominous connections to one of the new cadets at the academy.

The first season of Starfleet Academy is set to begin streaming on Paramount+ in early 2026. The show has already been renewed for a second season.

There are officially too many wild pairs of smart glasses coming out of China to keep track of. First, it was Xiaomi with its Ray-Ban-stomping pair of glasses that can record 45 minutes of consecutive video and boast an 8.5-hour battery life. Then, just last week, a company called Wigain announced a breakthrough in making mass-producible smart glasses with optical waveguide lenses. Those, I might add, also feel very Meta-killing. Now, it's Alibaba's turn, or it's about to be if rumors are to be believed.

According to unconfirmed reports from the XR Research Institute, which is also connected to rumors surrounding the third-gen version of Meta's Ray-Bans, Alibaba could release its first pair of self-made smart glasses very soon, and they could be—similar to the aforementioned glasses—far more advanced than what Meta offers in the U.S.

While I'm normally more skeptical of unconfirmed rumors like this, there's already supporting evidence on Reddit percolating out of the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) in Shanghai. Pictures, which surfaced on Friday, show a huge promotional pair of smart glasses hovering over a section of the conference for Tmall Genie. If you're not familiar, Tmall Genie is an Alibaba-owned brand, and rumors suggest that the glasses will allegedly launch under that banner. And on top of those clues, there's also the fact that Alibaba already has one toe in the smart glasses world with software.

First look at the Alibaba smartglasses with binocular display! byu/AR_MR_XR inaugmentedreality



Xiaomi has already partnered with Alibaba on a payment feature for its new AI smart glasses and has collaborated with AR glasses company RayNeo, so, given those ties, Alibaba seems like an obvious player in the space. If rumors are accurate, its product may be more advanced than Meta's Ray-Bans in a couple of key ways. For one, Alibaba may offer a pair of glasses with an actual display on them, which is something that Meta has yet to do. That will likely be the game-changing factor for most people on the fence about smart glasses who don't find them quite “smart” enough to warrant spending money on a pair. On that same note, XR Research Institute suggests that Alibaba's glasses will include optical waveguide lenses that make passthrough on AR glasses sharper and clearer—aspects that early startups in the AR glasses space have struggled with.

Even without knowing or confirming the rest of the smart glasses' specs or features, those things alone would be enough for Alibaba-made glasses to blow past Meta Ray-Bans, which are arguably the most popular brand of smart glasses in the U.S. It's once again proof that China is cooking on smart glasses and probably evidence that we can expect a lot more from China-based brands on that front. I'm curious whether any of those technological advances trickle over into the U.S. market as a result. My fingers are crossed, because as much as I use Meta's Ray-Bans, it's about time Meta takes a big step forward into the world of on-lens displays.

Ioannina, a lakeside town in northern Greece surrounded by mountains, is not the kind of place you expect to find cutting-edge artificial intelligence quietly reshaping medicine. Yet, inside its main public hospital, Dr. Tzimas is doing just that.

Dr. Tzimas is quietly reshaping how medicine is practiced. From spotting rare diseases like Q fever to managing conflicts among junior doctors, Dr. Tzimas has woven AI into the rhythm of daily medical life.

However, he believes that AI will not be able to replace the essential human interactions that are at the heart of his work. “You have to listen to lung sounds, palpate the abdomen, look patients into their eyes,” he says. “AI can't feel pain responses or smell signs of illness.”

Dr. Tzimas is the director of the Internal Medicine Department at General Hospital of Ioannina “G. Hatzikosta.”

This interview is part of our series How Do You Use AI?, where we ask people one simple question: How do you use AI? No TED Talk nonsense, just real life.

Episode 3: Dr. Thomas Tzimas—AI Pragmatist.

Gizmodo: How does AI fit into your daily medical practice?

Dr. Tzimas: AI acts as an assistant that helps us work faster and more reliably. We feed it solid data, review the output, and proceed if it's okay. This is particularly helpful when we need to respond to insurance companies about a patient's situation or send emails to family physicians.

Gizmodo: Can you give a specific example of how AI assists with patient care?

Dr. Tzimas: One major area is drug interactions. There are extensive tables of drug interactions, but they're difficult to access quickly when you're with a patient. AI systems can provide this information very easily and without mistakes. It also helps with adjusting dosages for patients with conditions like renal insufficiency or hepatic failure, where normal doses might be harmful.

Gizmodo: Are you concerned about AI “hallucinations” or inaccuracies in the medical field?

Dr. Tzimas: An experienced clinician can spot hallucinations right away. If you prompt the AI with very strict protocols, they do not hallucinate. The “temperature” setting of AI models is crucial; for the medical field, it needs to be set to 0.3, which makes them very strict and prevents them from fantasizing or hallucinating. Normal AI systems often have a temperature of 1, which leads to a lot of fantasizing and hallucinating.

Gizmodo: Do you use AI for personal matters?

Dr. Tzimas: I use AI for almost all my emails, especially within the communication platform among doctors. I use a “negotiator GPT” prompt that makes answers very diplomatic. This is particularly useful when there's a conflict among junior doctors, as I have to maintain integrity and prevent conflicts while still being strict. It helps me reply in a way that smooths over potential issues, like an accomplished diplomat would.

Gizmodo: Interesting…

Dr. Tzimas: I also use AI to create teaching materials very quickly. For instance, I can take a complex clinical case from a journal like the New England Journal of Medicine and ask the system to create multiple-choice questions from it. I then present these questions to the doctors, and I can see who answers correctly or incorrectly. The next day, I provided the correct answer. AI also helps me summarize large articles and complex medical cases from journals for easier discussion. This has freed up a lot of my time.

Gizmodo: Does AI assist with diagnosis?

Dr. Tzimas: AI tools are really capable for differential diagnosis. If a patient presents with a symptom like fever, it could be a thousand things. With AI, we can narrow down the possibilities to less than 10, and then through clinical examination, imaging, and consultations, we narrow it down to one. The system can even remind you of really rare conditions that might be happening to your patient.

Gizmodo: When was the last time AI helped you in a case?

Dr. Tzimas: A few hours ago, we completed a difficult case. One patient, a labor worker, had inhaled a lot of dust in a sheep and goat stable and came in with a fever. We used AI to consider what diseases could be contracted from dust in such a stable. One of the highly-ranked differential diagnoses was Q fever, which is very rare. We sent a blood sample to Athens to exclude it. Although it came back negative and the final diagnosis was unrelated, the AI system identified Q fever as a potential possibility, which opened our horizons. Without AI, Q fever might not have even on our list.

Gizmodo: Do your patients use AI themselves?

Dr. Tzimas: Yes, some patients now use AI, similar to how they used to Google their symptoms. They might come in saying, “This is what ChatGPT said,” and we have to respond to that. As AI spreads, people with health questions will use it to get analyses of their symptoms. Our job as doctors remains the same: to professionally answer questions and provide credible answers and solutions. This means doctors also need to use AI for support, paperwork, and even creating dietary plans for patients.

Gizomo: Does AI replace the need for administrative staff, like a personal assistant?

Dr. Tzimas: It reduces the need. For example, my previous boss would write notes on paper for his assistant to type. Now, I dictate notes on my iPhone, copy-paste them into an AI system, and it creates a nice email. Also, I can take pictures of paper documents, and AI can transcribe them into a digital form, saving tons of time and creating digital archives.

Gizmodo: Are you worried about AI replacing you?

Dr. Tzimas: No, not at all. My job involves experience that AI cannot yet replicate. I need to listen to lung, heart, and bowel sounds, palpate patients, and inspect them. While AI might analyze a digital photograph of a skin lesion, it cannot palpate a patient and feel the intensity of pain or guarding. These are qualities that rely on a doctor's senses, like smelling a patient's breath to detect diabetic ketoacidosis. Human interaction, like looking a patient in the eyes, observing their demeanor, and assessing their hygiene, provides crucial information that AI cannot easily replace. AI helps save time, but it needs an experienced physician to input those essential details.

Gizmodo: How does AI affect your work-life balance?

Dr. Tzimas: It saves time. Preparing teaching material used to take me hours; now I just spend an hour or a couple of hours and I'm ready. So I have more time for my personal life.

This Brand-New Telescope Saw It First","https://gizmodo.com/rubin-observatory-may-have-been-the-first-to-spot-interstellar-comet-3i-atlas-2000632526","Sat, 26 Jul 2025 14:00:52 GMT","

Nearly a month ago, a mysterious object was seen hurtling through the solar system and later confirmed as an interstellar visitor traveling toward the Sun. Several telescopes have since turned their attention to the wandering object, but it turns out the brand-new Vera C. Rubin Observatory was the first to catch a glimpse of 3I/ATLAS.

In an act of cosmic serendipity, astronomers pointed the Rubin Observatory toward the patch of sky where the interstellar object appeared during its commissioning phase. Images captured by the observatory, perched atop a mountain in the Chilean Andes, later revealed the comet in its full glory. Rubin's observations of 3I/ATLAS were recorded on June 21, around 10 days before its official discovery, according to a recent paper available on the preprint website arXiv.

The Rubin Observatory, overseen by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of Energy (DOE), boasts the largest digital camera ever built for astronomy. Its car-sized, 3.2-gigapixel camera is designed to capture ultra-high-definition images and videos of the cosmos. The observatory unveiled its first images to the public on June 23, observing millions of galaxies and stars in the Milky Way over a period of just 10 hours. The images were not only beautiful—they also revealed supernovas and distant galaxies that could help astronomers study the universe's expansion.

With its revolutionary precision, it's no wonder then that the Rubin Observatory captured the recently discovered comet before any other telescope. 3I/ATLAS was first spotted in data collected by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) between June 25 and 29, and again on July 1. By July 2, the Deep Random Survey remote telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, had seen it too. The International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center confirmed that this comet came from outside our solar system on July 2, marking the third discovery of an interstellar object.

Since then, astronomers have been rushing to gather as much data as they can on the mysterious object. The Gemini North telescope on Maunakea, Hawaii, recently snapped a close-up view of 3I/ATLAS, capturing the comet's coma in extreme detail. Initial observations of 3I/ATLAS suggest it's the oldest comet ever found, around 2 billion years older than our solar system. Compared to the two previously discovered interstellar objects, ‘Oumuamua and Comet 2I/Borisov, 3I/ATLAS is not only older, but it's also faster. A recent study, which has yet to undergo peer review, found that 3I/ATLAS has a hyperbolic velocity of about 37 miles per second (60 kilometers per second).

Rubin's early observations of 3I/ATLAS are important considering they are the earliest images captured of the comet by a high-precision telescope. The new paper includes 49 images in total, although some were excluded because they were captured during Rubin's alignment sequence and were out of focus. Nineteen of the images were captured during intentional operations and confirm that 3I/ATLAS does in fact behave like a comet, with a cloud of gas and dust surrounding its icy nucleus, according to the paper.

Just as it was the first to spot the comet, Rubin will also be the first to lose sight of it. On August 22, 3I/ATLAS will shift out of the area in the sky currently being watched by the observatory. Until then, the astronomers behind the paper will keep an eye out for the interstellar visitor in Rubin's images.

As ITHome reported, China is pushing its domestic GPU efforts into uncharted territory with Lisuan Tech's first consumer and professional graphics cards, the 7G106 and 7G105.

Built on TSMC's 6nm N6 process, the 7G106 and 7G105 are powered by the company's in-house TrueGPU architecture and aim to compete directly with mid-range offerings from Nvidia and AMD. While the spotlight is on gaming performance, Lisuan is positioning these chips as multi-purpose accelerators for AI, cloud rendering, and even metaverse applications.

The consumer-focused 7G106 features 12 GB of GDDR6 memory on a 192-bit bus, 192 texture units, 96 ROPs, and an FP32 throughput of up to 24 TFLOP/s. It features four DisplayPort 1.4 outputs with DSC 1.2b compression and supports DirectX 12 (minus ray tracing), Vulkan 1.3, OpenGL 4.6, and OpenCL 3.0. Its single 8-pin PCIe connector also suggests a TDP of around 225W.

On the other hand, the professional 7G105 doubles memory to 24 GB with ECC, offering up to 192 GB/s of pixel fill rate, 384 GB/s of texture fill rate, and the same 24 TFLOP/s compute ceiling. Both cards include hardware-accelerated AV1 and HEVC decode up to 8K60 and encode capabilities at 8K30 for HEVC and 4K30 for AV1.

What sets Lisuan apart from past Chinese GPU attempts is its claim of building the TrueGPU architecture from scratch, including the instruction set, compute core, and software stack. The company touts ""intelligent multitasking"" with up to 48 concurrent tasks, out-of-order triangle rendering for 50% faster efficiency in certain scenes, and dual FP32/INT32 instruction emission.

There's also a unique matrix memory layout designed to boost memory efficiency by 40%, along with dynamic load balancing that distributes rendering and compute tasks across cores in real time. Lisuan even claims NRSS, a proprietary rendering quality optimization system designed to rival Nvidia DLSS and AMD FSR.

Benchmark results paint a mixed but promising picture. In synthetic tests, the 7G106 scored 26,800 points in 3DMark Fire Strike and 2,256 in Steel Nomad, putting it roughly on par with Nvidia's RTX 4060 in Fire Strike. Geekbench 6 OpenCL saw it notch 111,290 points, edging out the RTX 4060 by around 10%.

Gaming demos were equally noteworthy: Black Myth: Wukong and Wuchang: Fallen Feathers both ran at over 70 FPS in 4K High settings, while Shadow of the Tomb Raider topped 80 FPS under similar conditions. High-profile titles like these running on a GPU architecture in its infancy paint a very positive picture for the platform's stability, more so than raw performance numbers.

The 7G105 professional variant leans heavily on AI and enterprise markets, supporting SR-IOV virtualization with up to 16 containers. Lisuan highlights its applicability for cloud gaming, digital twins, virtual reality, and even robotics. The company claims its eXtreme series cards are ready to handle large AI models such as DeepSeek and Wenshengtu, extending their utility beyond traditional PC gaming.

Lisuan's announcement marks a new phase for China's domestic GPU ambitions. While past efforts, such as Zhaoxin's integrated solutions and Moore Threads' early discrete GPUs, struggled to break into the mainstream, Lisuan's 6nm designs represent a bold attempt to close the gap with global players. If its claims of architectural independence and performance parity hold up under independent testing, this could be the first time a Chinese GPU maker truly competes with AMD and Nvidia in the discrete GPU space.

Mass production of the Lisuan 7G106 and 7G105 is expected to begin in September 2025, following sampling in August. Pricing and final clock speeds are yet to be announced. Still, Lisuan's domestic-first strategy could make these cards a viable alternative for Chinese gamers and enterprises facing rising costs and export restrictions.

N1X's got some beefy Arms.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Nvidia's long-rumored and long-delayed N1X SoC has broken cover once again, this time revealing its GPU capabilities through a fresh Geekbench OpenCL listing. We've seen various CPU-focused leaks surrounding this chip before, but this provides our first genuine look at the GPU. That being said, this isn't final silicon—it's an early engineering sample—but the details are enough to show where Nvidia is headed with its first consumer-class ARM SoC for laptops and possibly desktops.

The Geekbench entry confirms a 20-core CPU setup split into two 10-core clusters, built on Nvidia's Grace architecture. More importantly, it confirms 48 Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs), translating to 6,144 CUDA cores—the exact count as the desktop GeForce RTX 5070. Interestingly, these specs also match Nvidia's GB10 Superchip, which currently powers the DGX Spark AI mini-PCs, suggesting that N1X might be a repurposed, possibly lower-power version aimed at the mainstream market. After all, they're both ARM-based chips developed in unison with MediaTek.

Performance, however, is still in the rough. This sample clocked in at a modest 1.05 GHz and scored 46,361 in OpenCL, roughly in the territory of the RTX 2050. The reason is power and frequency limits, which are typical of early prototypes, as well as the absence of dedicated GDDR memory, since the SoC relies on shared LPDDR5X.



Even in this state, the N1X's iGPU is already outpacing every modern integrated GPU, including Apple's M3 Max and AMD's 890M, which top out at around 37,500 in similar benchmarks. The GPU performance ceiling is higher, given that a fully powered RTX 5070 boosts to 2.5 GHz with a 250W TDP, while the N1X is capped at around 120W for the entire chip.

This isn't the first time the N1X has appeared on Geekbench. Earlier leaks revealed its CPU performance was competitive but not earth-shattering, which is to be expected from unfinished drivers and firmware. With the latest listing, Nvidia is signaling a hybrid approach: pairing a Blackwell GPU core array with an ARM-based CPU cluster, aiming for a balance of AI performance, gaming, and efficiency—similar to how AMD's Strix Halo and Apple's M-series chips are positioned.

There's still no launch date in sight. Rumors suggest a Q1 2026 release, possibly timed to coincide with the next wave of AI-focused Windows laptops, as Microsoft appears to be holding up on that at the moment. For now, Nvidia's N1X sits in the shadows, a prototype with the specs of a mid-tier discrete GPU and ambitions to push iGPU performance into uncharted territory.

If Nvidia gives this chip the power and bandwidth it needs, the N1X could be the first ARM-based SoC to seriously challenge x86 giants like AMD and Intel on high-performance laptops—and maybe even take a bite out of Apple's lead in the premium AI laptop segment.

A silicon enthusiast is taking their obsession to another level by marketing a new line of CPU jewelry. The decorative wearable trinkets we spotted this week are based around Apple Silicon. In the main picture, and the source Tweet below, you can see a collection of nearly 20 Apple M1 SoCs that are set to be transformed into hair clips.

Twitter/X-based @YuuKi_AnS, probably better known for their contributions to the silicon rumor mill, including various high-profile leaks, is the creator behind these upcoming Apple M1 Pro hair clips. The Goofish link in the Tweet doesn't provide any further images, so what you see above is all we have to get a feel for this new fashion line.

After examining the image in detail, it appears that Yuuki_Ans has already converted about half of their M1 Pro samples into hair clips. You can see 10 of the chips, on the left, seemingly propped up by a colorful hair clip-style assembly affixed to their undersides.

You may think that the hair clip assembly, with its plastic appearance, doesn't offer the premium build to match the Apple M1 Pro's technical pedigree. However, at a list price of 90 Chinese Yuan (about $12.50), it is hard to grumble about what you get.

According to the Goofish retail site, seven of these hair clips are already reserved. If you want one and have access to this marketplace, moving with haste is recommended.

We have covered the interesting and sometimes provocative crossover between tech and fashion many times over the years. Back in 2010, we covered electronic component-based earrings, PCB-based Christmas decorations, and many more ways creators have recycled or upcycled old computer parts. RGB LEDs also have strong crossover potential between technology and fashion.

More recently, we covered the launch of the ultimate fashion accessory to advertise your conspicuous consumption - GPU Purses. Much more affordable, yet more charming, were the WinRAR Messenger bags that we reported on this June.

However, we note that CPU jewelry has its roots dating back to 1994. According to Chipsetc, Intel had a brainwave promotional idea, to sell off flawed Pentium chips as “earrings, pins, link bracelets, cuff links, and even Pentium keychains.”

It is noted that these bejazzled chips were a result of serious production losses from the Intel fabs. Please don't confuse them with the infamous Floating Point Division bug processors, which were sold to unsuspecting customers until the end of the same year (1994).

This handheld console packs a punch.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Famed handheld gaming PC maker GPD has just teased the Win 5, the latest generation of its top-of-the-line handheld console, which features the powerful AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395. Although we didn't see much in the video, thankfully, the YouTube channel The Phawx (PhawxTV) provided more details, revealing hardware specifications and a massive 80Wh external, removable battery.

This move counters the trend of incorporating built-in batteries into everything, allowing you to swap batteries when you run out of power easily. It's also better for repairability, as you can just easily purchase a compatible battery from GPD and replace the old one in your system when it no longer works as expected.

Its spec sheet also says that the battery is backpack mountable (probably like mounting on the back of the console) or wired charging (which feels like it can be used as a power bank). This means you can place the battery on a desk and attach it to the console via cable, thereby reducing the weight you carry during those long gaming sessions.

Aside from the Ryzen AI Max+ 395, you can also get the Win 5 with the less potent AMD Ryzen AI Max 385. This cheaper version has half the cores and threads of the more powerful chip, but should still be enough for the average handheld gamer.

You can also configure the console's memory from 32GB to 128GB, ensuring you'll have enough RAM for both the CPU and the integrated GPU. It only has one M.2 NVMe 2280 slot, but you can choose between 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB configurations, ensuring you won't run out of storage for all the titles you plan to add to it.

A few gamers were worried that the GPD Win 5 would inherit its predecessor's smaller 6-inch display. Thankfully, it now features a 7-inch 120 Hz display with 1080p resolution and 10-point touch control. It's also protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 6, which is already somewhat outdated, as it was introduced in 2018. Still, it's better than nothing, and you're not supposed to stash it in your bag or pocket without a case.

We're excited to see the GPD Win 5, which is supposed to be revealed at ChinaJoy 2025 on August 1. Hopefully, it will become available at a relatively affordable price, giving gamers a next-generation console.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Researchers discover new trigger for mitophagy","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250726/Researchers-discover-new-trigger-for-mitophagy.aspx","Sat, 26 Jul 2025 04:31:00 GMT","

Autophagy is essentially the 'rubbish collection' of our cells. If there are problems in this process, which is so important for our health, diseases such as Parkinson's can result. In their latest study, leading cell biologists at the Max Perutz Labs at the University of Vienna investigated mitophagy - a form of autophagy - and came to a remarkable conclusion: the researchers have described a new trigger for mitophagy.

This discovery has led to a reassessment of the hierarchy of factors that trigger autophagy. The newly discovered signalling pathways could also open up novel therapeutic options. The study has been published in the renowned journal Nature Cell Biology.


Autophagy is a self-cleaning process of the cell and is crucial for cell health in the human body. A sophisticated molecular surveillance command identifies suspicious substances - broken cell components, clumped proteins or even pathogens - and initiates their removal. Finally, defective cell components are broken down and recycled.

Mitophagy is a form of autophagy in which mitochondria within a cell are specifically degraded. Dysregulation of mitophagy is particularly associated with Parkinson's disease. A better understanding of this process is therefore important for combating Parkinson's.

In a new study led by postdoctoral researcher Elias Adriaenssens from Sascha Martens' group at the Max Perutz Labs at the University of Vienna, the scientists reveal a new mechanism for triggering mitophagy. Until now, research has focused heavily on the 'PINK1/Parkin signalling pathway'. Signalling pathways are used to transmit information within cells. These complex networks of molecules control critical cellular functions such as growth, division, cell death and, indeed, mitophagy.



""When we looked at the big picture, it became clear that, apart from the much-studied 'PINK1/Parkin pathway', there were huge gaps in our knowledge of other mitophagy pathways. Our laboratory has explored these neglected areas by using biochemical reconstitutions to gain fundamental mechanistic insights.""

Elias Adriaenssens, Study Leader and Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Vienna 



""We found that NIX and BNIP3 - two known mitophagy receptors - can trigger autophagy without binding to FIP200 (a protein), which was quite unexpected,"" explains Adriaenssens.

FIP200 is considered essential for triggering autophagy. ""This presented us with a puzzle. Despite extensive testing, we were unable to detect any interaction between FIP200 and either of the two receptors - which raises the crucial question of how they function without this supposedly crucial component,"" he adds.

However, mass spectrometry revealed that other autophagy components, known as WIPI proteins, bind to these mitochondrial receptors. Since WIPI proteins were previously thought to act later in the signalling pathway, their involvement in triggering autophagy was surprising. Follow-up experiments confirmed these interactions and suggested that WIPI-mediated recruitment is not an exception, but may mediate previously unknown pathways in selective autophagy.

""This is an exciting discovery - it reveals a parallel trigger for selective autophagy. Instead of a single, universal mechanism, cells appear to use different molecular strategies depending on the receptor and context. Until now, no one has considered WIPI proteins to be key players in triggering autophagosome formation, but our discovery could change that view,"" explains Adriaenssens.

 

Looking ahead, the study raises an important question: How do cells decide between alternative mitophagy signalling pathways - why do some receptors use one and others the other, and what factors determine which pathway is used? Distinguishing between selective mitophagy signalling pathways could pave the way for therapies that specifically activate one pathway to compensate for defects in the other, which has long-term potential for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

A potential target for experimental drugs that block PRMT5 - a naturally occurring enzyme some tumors rely more on for survival - has been identified by researchers with the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute's Cancer Research Center in Washington, D.C.

In a study published this month in Cancer Research, Assistant Professor Kathleen Mulvaney of Virginia Tech's Fralin Biomedical Research Institute shared research that could help guide development of new therapies for some treatment-resistant lung, brain, and pancreatic cancers.

""Using genetic screening, we found a new drug combination that seemingly works.""

Kathleen Mulvaney, Assistant Professor, Fralin Biomedical Research Institute, Virginia Tech

New therapies are needed. Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death globally. The five-year survival rate is less than 15 percent for pancreatic cancer patients, and even lower for glioblastoma. 

""With one drug alone, tumors can become resistant really quickly,"" said Mulvaney, who is a member of the research institute's Cancer Research Center in Washington, D.C. Treatment often fails. The findings suggest the PRMT5 inhibitor could be a powerful new approach for certain hard-to-treat cancers. ""In all cases, the combination is better at killing than the single agents.""

Many of these solid tumors share a genetic trait: They lack CDKN2A and MTAP, two genes that suppress tumors and help regulate cell growth. Without them, the cancers become dependent on PRMT5 and potentially vulnerable to drugs that block the enzyme.

Mulvaney and colleagues analyzed genetic data from thousands of cancer patients available through the cBioPortal.

They applied CRISPR editing tools to look at biological pathways across a range of samples to determine which genes make cancer cells more vulnerable to PRMT5 inhibitors and which combinations could improve response and long-term outcomes.

An estimated 5 percent of all cancer patients - about 80,000 to 100,000 per year in the U.S. - can benefit from the therapies identified, according to Mulvaney, who also holds an appointment in biomedical sciences and pathobiology in the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine.

Using PRMT5 inhibitors with drugs that block a communication system that tells cancer cells when to grow, divide, or shut down - known as the MAP kinase pathway - scientists identified potential treatments for clinical trials. 

""We also discovered a number of genes that interact with PRMT5 signaling in cancer that were not previously known,"" Mulvaney said.

In addition to lung, brain, and pancreatic cancers, the treatment shows promise for some types of melanoma and mesothelioma.

In both animal models and cell cultures derived from patient tissue, lab members saw success after testing potential therapies. 

""In all cases, the combination is better at killing cancer cells than the single agents,"" Mulvaney said. ""Only the combinations led to complete regressions.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","VCU Massey pioneers clinical trial of novel GGT-1 inhibitor PTX-100","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250726/VCU-Massey-pioneers-clinical-trial-of-novel-GGT-1-inhibitor-PTX-100.aspx","Sat, 26 Jul 2025 04:08:00 GMT","

VCU Massey Comprehensive Cancer Center is the first site in the United States to be activated in a global Phase 2a clinical trial evaluating PTX-100 (AKA GGTI-2418), a first-in-class small molecule inhibitor of geranylgeranyl transferase-1 (GGT-1), for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), a rare and often treatment-resistant T-cell lymphoma.

Said Sebti, Ph.D., associate director for basic research and Lacy Family Chair in Cancer Research at Massey and professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology at the VCU School of Medicine, is the co-inventor of PTX-100 and the scientific founder at Prescient Therapeutics, which is sponsoring the trial.

""This trial reflects Massey's long-standing commitment to translating basic science discoveries into innovative treatments that can directly benefit patients.""

Said Sebti, PhD, Professor, Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University

Thinking about the journey of PTX-100, Sebti remarked, ""As a cancer researcher, there is no greater fulfillment than seeing a therapy you co-invented in the laboratory begin to reach those who need it most. With the launch of this global Phase 2 trial of PTX-100 in CTCL, where new treatments are urgently needed, that long-held dream feels deeply real.

To see my academic home, Massey, lead the way as the first U.S. site to open enrollment to this trial, is one of the most exhilarating and humbling moments of my career, and is a powerful reminder of what science can achieve when driven by purpose and passion.

The newly launched phase 2a global trial will enroll patients with CTCL across leading academic cancer centers in the United States, Australia and Europe, with the aim of further evaluating the efficacy and safety of PTX-100 in patients with relapsed or refractory disease.

PTX-100 is currently believed to be the only GGT-1 inhibitor in clinical development globally, representing a novel class of targeted therapies. After demonstrating safety and early signals of clinical activity in a first-in-human Phase 1 study, PTX-100 advanced into a Phase 1b expansion cohort focused on patients with T-cell lymphomas, where it showed encouraging signs of efficacy and a favorable safety profile.

Based on these results, PTX-100 received orphan drug designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration for all T-cell lymphomas, as well as fast-track designation for the treatment of relapsed or refractory mycosis fungoides, the most common form of CTCL.

CTCL is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma where immune cells called T cells become cancerous and primarily affect the skin, causing itchy, red, scaly patches that may resemble eczema or psoriasis.

The enzyme GGT-1 plays a critical role in cancer biology, as it is essential for the activation of Rho, Rac, and Ral proteins, molecular switches that mediate the cancer-causing activity of the oncogene RAS, one of the most commonly mutated oncogenes in human cancers.

Sebti and his colleagues have pioneered the development of GGT-1 inhibitors designed to block these downstream RAS effector pathways, thereby inducing programmed cell death and halting tumor growth in a variety of cancer models.

""This global Phase 2a clinical trial of PTX-100 will help provide an extension of care for our patients diagnosed with this rare cancer, for which new therapies are urgently needed,"" Robert A. Winn, M.D., director and Lipman Chair in Oncology at Massey, said. ""We are incredibly proud of Dr. Sebti and his team for bridging the gap between world-class scientific innovation and the communities we serve, ultimately making significant strides in the fight against cancer.""

Millions suffering from myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), a debilitating condition often overlooked due to the lack of diagnostic tools, may be closer to personalized care, according to new research that shows how the disease disrupts interactions between the microbiome, immune system, and metabolism.

The findings-potentially relevant to long COVID due to its similarity with ME/CFS-come from data on 249 individuals analyzed using a new artificial intelligence (AI) platform that identifies disease biomarkers from stool, blood, and other routine lab tests.

""Our study achieved 90% accuracy in distinguishing individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome, which is significant because doctors currently lack reliable biomarkers for diagnosis. Some physicians doubt it as a real disease due to the absence of clear laboratory markers, sometimes attributing it to psychological factors.""

 Dr. Derya Unutmaz, Study Author and Professor, Immunology, The Jackson Laboratory 

The research was led by Dr. Julia Oh, formerly at JAX and now a microbiologist and professor at Duke University, in collaboration with ME/CFS clinicians Lucinda Bateman and Suzanne Vernon of the Bateman Horne Center, and Unutmaz, who directs the JAX ME/CFS Collaborative Research Center. Details appear today in Nature Medicine.

Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterized by severe symptoms that significantly impair physical and mental activities, including persistent fatigue, sleep abnormalities, dizziness, and chronic pain.

Experts often compare ME/CFS to long COVID, as both conditions frequently follow viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus. In the United States, ME/CFS affects between 836,000 and 3.3 million individuals- many undiagnosed-and costs the economy $18 to $51 billion annually due to healthcare expenditures and lost productivity, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Prior studies have noted immune disruptions in ME/CFS, Unutmaz said. This new research builds upon those findings by investigating how the gut microbiome, its metabolites, and immune responses interact. The team linked these connections to 12 classes of patient-reported symptoms, which were aggregated from hundreds of datapoints generated by patient health and lifestyle surveys.

These include sleep disturbances, headaches, fatigue, dizziness, and other symptoms the researchers mapped in their entirety from microbiome changes to metabolites, immune responses, and clinical symptoms.

""We integrated clinical symptoms with cutting-edge omics technologies to identify new biomarkers of ME/CFS,"" Oh said. ""Linking symptoms at this level is crucial, because ME/CFS is highly variable. Patients experience a wide range of symptoms that differ in severity and duration, and current methods can't fully capture that complexity."" 

To conduct the study, the researchers analyzed comprehensive data collected from the Bateman Horne Center, a leading ME/CFS, Long-Covid, and fibromyalgia research center in Salt Lake City, Utah. Dr. Ruoyun Xiong, also a lead author on the study, developed a deep neural network model called BioMapAI. The tool integrates gut metagenomics, plasma metabolomics, immune cell profiles, blood test data, and clinical symptoms from 153 patients and 96 healthy individuals over four years.

Immune cell analysis proved most accurate in predicting symptom severity, while microbiome data best predicted gastrointestinal, emotional, and sleep disturbances. The model connected thousands of patient data points, reconstructing symptoms such as pain and gastrointestinal issues, among several others. It also revealed that patients who were ill for less than four years had fewer disrupted networks than those who were ill for more than ten years.

""Our data indicate these biological disruptions become more entrenched over time,"" Unutmaz said. ""That doesn't mean longer-duration ME/CFS can't be reversed, but it may be more challenging.""

The study included 96 age- and gender-matched healthy controls, showing balanced microbiome-metabolite-immune interactions, in contrast to significant disruptions in ME/CFS patients linked to fatigue, pain, emotional regulation issues, and sleep disorders.

ME/CFS patients also had lower levels of butyrate, a beneficial fatty acid produced in the gut, along with other nutrients essential for metabolism, inflammation control, and energy. Patients with elevated levels of tryptophan, benzoate, and other markers indicated a microbial imbalance. Heightened inflammatory responses, particularly involving MAIT cells sensitive to gut microbial health, were also observed.

""MAIT cells bridge gut health to broader immune functions, and their disruption alongside butyrate and tryptophan pathways, normally anti-inflammatory, suggests a profound imbalance,"" said Unutmaz.

Even though the findings require further validation, they significantly advance scientists' understanding of ME/CFS and provide clearer hypotheses for future research, the authors said.

Since animal models can't fully reflect the complex neurological, physiological, immune, and other system disruptions seen in ME/CFS, Oh said it will be crucial to study humans directly to identify modifiable factors and develop targeted treatments.

""The microbiome and metabolome are dynamic,""Oh said. ""That means we may be able to intervene-through diet, lifestyle, or targeted therapies-in ways that genomic data alone can't offer.""

BioMapAI also achieved roughly 80% accuracy in external data sets, confirming key biomarkers identified in the original group. This consistency across diverse data was striking, the authors said.

""Despite diverse data collection methods, common disease signatures emerged in fatty acids, immune markers, and metabolites,"" Oh said. ""That tells us this is not random. This is real biological dysregulation.""

The researchers intend to share their dataset broadly with BioMapAI, which supports analyses across diverse symptoms and diseases, effectively integrating multi-omics data that are difficult to replicate in animal models.

""Our goal is to build a detailed map of how the immune system interacts with gut bacteria and the chemicals they produce,"" Oh said. ""By connecting these dots we can start to understand what's driving the disease and pave the way for genuinely precise medicine that has long been out of reach.""

As artificial intelligence is rapidly developing and becoming a growing presence in healthcare communication, a new study addresses a concern that large language models (LLMs) can reinforce harmful stereotypes by using stigmatizing language.

The study from researchers at Mass General Brigham found that more than 35% of responses in answers related to alcohol- and substance use-related conditions contained stigmatizing language. But the researchers also highlight that targeted prompts can be used to substantially reduce stigmatizing language in the LLMs' answers. Results are published in The Journal of Addiction Medicine. 

""Using patient-centered language can build trust and improve patient engagement and outcomes. It tells patients we care about them and want to help. Stigmatizing language, even through LLMs, may make patients feel judged and could cause a loss of trust in clinicians.""

Wei Zhang, MD, PhD, Study Corresponding Author and Assistant Professor, Division of Gastroenterology, Mass General Hospital

LLM responses are generated from everyday language, which often includes biased or harmful language towards patients. Prompt engineering is a process of strategically crafting input instructions to guide model outputs towards non-stigmatizing language and can be used to train LLMs to employ more inclusive language for patients. This study showed that employing prompt engineering within LLMs reduced the likelihood of stigmatizing language by 88%.

For their study, the authors tested 14 LLMs on 60 generated clinically relevant prompts related to alcohol use disorder (AUD), alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), and substance use disorder (SUD). Mass General Brigham physicians then assessed the responses for stigmatizing language using guidelines from the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (both organizations' official names still contain outdated and stigmatizing terminology).

Their results indicated that 35.4% of responses from LLMs without prompt engineering contained stigmatizing language, in comparison to 6.3% of LLMs with prompt engineering. Additionally, results indicated that longer responses are associated with a higher likelihood of stigmatizing language in comparison to shorter responses. The effect was seen across all 14 models tested, although some models were more likely than others to use stigmatizing terms.

Future directions include developing chatbots that avoid stigmatizing language to improve patient engagement and outcomes. The authors advise clinicians to proofread LLM-generated content to avoid stigmatizing language before using it in patient interactions and to offer alternative, patient-centered language options.

The authors note that future research should involve patients and family members with lived experience to refine definitions and lexicons of stigmatizing language, ensuring LLM outputs align with the needs of those most affected. This study reinforces the need to prioritize language in patient care as LLMs become increasingly used in healthcare communication.

A new study led by Stephen D. Nimer, M.D., director of Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, part of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, shows how a key molecule regulates the generation of new blood cells, a process called hematopoiesis that goes awry in cancer. The findings have the potential to lead to new therapeutic strategies targeting the molecule, a regulator of gene activity called TAF1.

The new findings ""not only challenge prevailing models of hematopoietic regulation but also lay the groundwork for innovative clinical applications,"" said Sylvester researcher Ramin Shiekhattar, Ph.D., co-leader of the Cancer Epigenetics Program at Sylvester and chief of the Division of Cancer Genomics and Epigenetics. He is also an author on the study, which was published July 16th, 2025, in the journal Developmental Cell.

Long-time collaborators, Nimer, Shiekhattar, and colleagues previously reported that knocking out TAF1 quelled disease in a model of acute myeloid leukemia driven by the aberrant gene regulator AML1-ETO.

TAF1 seems to work together with the AML1-ETO protein to turn on cancer-causing genes, the researchers showed.

TAF1 is part of a large molecular machine that binds to DNA and helps activate genes. The machine helps initiate the process of transcription, which involves generating RNA from the DNA code.

In the current study, the researchers took a closer look at TAF1 to better understand how it operates in normal blood cell development.

Blood cells arise from immature cells in the bone marrow called hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).

HSCs are powerful cells. They are used for transplantation. And they do two key things: they self-renew and they give rise to mature cell types including immune cells (both T cells and B cells), myeloid cells (neutrophils and monocytes), platelets, and red blood cells, in a process called lineage commitment.

TAF1 is needed to properly turn on genes involved in lineage commitment in adults, but it has a reduced role in HSC self-renewal, according to these just published findings. The data also demonstrate that TAF1 operates differently during embryogenesis, when there is a much higher demand for blood production.

""TAF1 appears to serve as a key molecular switch that integrates transcriptional signals to balance stem cell maintenance with lineage commitment in adults.""

Ramin Shiekhattar, PhD, Study Author and Chief, Division of Cancer Genomics and Epigenetics, University of Miami

The findings challenge the prevailing view of how TAF1 functions, said the researchers. TAF1 and its associated machinery were long thought to be universally necessary for turning on genes throughout the life of every cell.

The new study adds to growing evidence that TAF1 instead has a more fine-tuned role in gene regulation, in this study, preferentially turning on genes that prompt HSCs to differentiate into mature blood cells.

""The most surprising discovery is that adult HSCs can survive without an important general transcription factor, and that the TAF1 loss only affects the activation of differentiation-associated genes, not the self-renewal-promoting genes,"" said Sylvester researcher Fan Liu, Ph.D., the first author of the study.

Nimer's team, working with Sylvester bioinformatics specialist Felipe Beckedorff, Ph.D., delved even further into how TAF1 turns on genes. They found that TAF1 both prompts the initiation of transcription and releases a separate brake on the transcription process.

Questions for future studies include whether TAF1 performs similar functions in other stem cell compartments relevant for cancer, such as in the colon or brain.

Meanwhile, the new findings provide momentum to studies investigating TAF1-targeting agents, which are under development.

One challenge in hematology is finding drugs that are powerful enough to kill the cancer cells but not kill normal blood cell development. The data suggest that TAF1 inhibitors might fulfill this criterion: knocking out TAF1 did not stop stem cell self-renewal or blood cell production, which are essential for life.

""A key question that we needed to address was; if you successfully target TAF1, do you compromise normal blood production? What this paper says is no,"" said Nimer.

Other potential therapeutic use-cases include harnessing TAF1 to improve the expansion of HSCs in petri dishes, a process that could improve stem cell transplantation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New model predicts mRNA protein production, accelerating drug and vaccine discovery","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250726/New-model-predicts-mRNA-protein-production-accelerating-drug-and-vaccine-discovery.aspx","Sat, 26 Jul 2025 04:31:00 GMT","

A new artificial intelligence model can improve the process of drug and vaccine discovery by predicting how efficiently specific mRNA sequences will produce proteins, both generally and in various cell types. The new advance, developed through an academic-industrial partnership between The University of Texas at Austin and Sanofi, helps predict how much protein cells will produce, which can minimize the need for trial-and-error experimentation, accelerating the next generation of mRNA therapeutics.

Messenger RNA (mRNA) contains instructions for which proteins to make and how to make them, enabling our bodies to grow and carry out the day-to-day processes of life. Among the most promising areas of health and medicine, the ability to develop new mRNA vaccines and drugs - able to fight viruses, cancers and genetic disorders - involves the frequently challenging process of coaxing cells in a patient's body to produce enough protein from therapeutic mRNA to effectively combat disease. 

The new model, called RiboNN, stands to guide the design of new mRNA-based therapeutics by illuminating what will yield the highest amount of a protein or better target specific parts of the body such as the heart or liver. The team described their model today in one of two related papers in the journal Nature Biotechnology.

""When we started this project over six years ago, there was no obvious application. We were curious whether cells coordinate which mRNAs they produce and how efficiently they are translated into proteins. That is the value of curiosity-driven research. It builds the foundation for advances like RiboNN, which only become possible much later.""

Can Cenik, Associate professor, Molecular Biosciences, University of Texas, Austin

The work was made possible by funding support from the National Institutes of Health, The Welch Foundation and the Lonestar6 supercomputer at UT's Texas Advanced Computing Center.

In tests spanning more than 140 human and mouse cell types, RiboNN was about twice as accurate at predicting translation efficiency as earlier approaches. This advance may lend researchers the ability to make predictions in cells in ways that could help expedite treatments for cancer and infectious and hereditary diseases. 

You can think of the way cells in your body make proteins as the way a team of chefs might bake cakes. To cook up a batch of proteins, the chefs in one of your cells (ribosomes) look up the recipe in your own unique protein cookbook (a.k.a. DNA), copy the recipe onto notecards called messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and then combine ingredients (amino acids) according to the recipe to bake up the cakes (proteins).

An mRNA vaccine or therapeutic coaxes these chefs in your cells into making proteins. In the case of a vaccine, they might produce a protein found on the surface of a pathogenic virus or cancer cells, essentially waving a big red flag in front of your immune system to make antibodies against the virus or cancer. In the case of a disorder caused by a genetic mutation, they might produce a protein that your body can't properly make on its own, reversing the disorder.

Before developing their new predictive model, Cenik and the UT team first curated a set of publicly available data from over 10,000 experiments measuring how efficiently different mRNAs are translated into proteins in different human and mouse cell types. Once they had created this training dataset, AI and machine learning experts from UT and Sanofi came together to develop RiboNN.

One goal of the predictive tool is to one day make therapies that are targeted to a particular cell type, said Cenik, who also is affiliate faculty at UT's Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences and a CPRIT scholar, receiving research support from the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas.

""Maybe you need a next-generation therapy to be made in the liver or the lung or in immune cells,"" he said. ""This opens up an opportunity to change the mRNA sequence to increase the production of that protein in that cell type.""

In a companion paper also in Nature Biotechnology, the team demonstrated that mRNAs with related biological functions are translated into proteins at similar levels across different cell types. Scientists have long known that the process of transcribing genes with related functions into mRNAs is coordinated, but it hadn't been previously shown that translating mRNAs into proteins is also coordinated.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","U.S. U-17 Women's National Team Draws 1-1 with Canada to Open 4 Nations Tournament In Mexico City, Then Wins Penalty Kick Shootout, 5-3","https://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2025/07/u-17-womens-national-team-draws-canada-4-nations-tournament-mexico-city","Sat, 26 Jul 2025 22:48:03 GMT","

MEXICO CITY, Mexico (July 26, 2025) – The U.S. U-17 Women's National Team opened the 4 Nations Tournament with a 1-1  draw with Canada as outside back Sydney Schmidt equalized with a header off a corner kick in the 88th minute.

Tournament regulations stipulate that each team earns one point for a draw, followed by a penalty kick shootout, with the winner earning an additional point in this round-robin tournament, which also features host Mexico and Costa Rica.

The USA went first in the shootout, and Schmidt made it two goals in a matter of minutes when she led with a powerful conversion. Forward Lauren Malsom, midfielder Scottie Antonucci (whose shot was touched by the goalkeeper but hit the post and rolled over the line), and team captain and central defender PearlCecil then all coolly finished their spot kicks. On Canada's fourth attempt, Olivia Chisholm squared off with U.S. goalkeeper Peyton Trayer but skied her shot way over the bar. That set the stage for Nyanya Touray's winning shot, which she calmly dispatched into the net, sparking an exuberant celebration from the U.S. team.

The USA will next face Costa Rica on July 29 (9 a.m. MT / 11 a.m. ET on live on Telemundo Deportes' YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and Tiktok accounts) and then Mexico on Aug. 1 (11:15 am MT / 1:15 pm ET live on Telemundo Deportes' YouTube and Facebook accounts) to finish up the round-robin competition.

The young Americans struggled to get things going in the first half, and a tough and athletic Canada side scored off a set play in the 41st minute. A long service into the penalty box by Lacey Kindel found the head Chloe Taylor, and she guided it into the upper right side of the net for the 1-0 lead, giving Trayer no chance.

In an evenly played first half, the USA had the first chance, coming in the fifth minute when midfielder Jaiden Rodriguez struck a heavy free kick from about 25 yards that had to be parried away by Canada goalkeeper Olivia Busby at the right post.

Canada skimmed a shot off the crossbar soon after, and in the 21st minute Rodriguez hit the woodwork as well, spinning her shot 17-yard off attempt off the intersection of the crossbar and post at the right corner.

Trayer had to make a nice save on a low shot to the left post, but the USA had the final two chances of the half as Rodriguez flashed a shot just outside the right post from the top of the penalty area.

In the 45th minute, center forward Ella Kral ran the ball down on the left wing, cut in and forced a diving save from Busby with a shot from 19 yards out that was headed into the left side of the net.

The second half was an entirely different story as the USA kept Canada pinned in its half with a combination of quick passing through the midfield, pressing defense and some dangerous flank play. Canada had a few dangerous looks off the counter, but it always seemed as if another goal came, it would be the Americans to score it. And they did.

With stellar performances from second-half subs Antonucci, Loradana Paletta, Touray, Anastasia Showler-Little, Malsom and Elayna Kocher putting intense attacking pressure on Canada, the USA earned a corner kick from the right side in the 88th minute. Antonucci served a perfect cross to the far post, where Schmidt, who played both left and right back in the game, crashed through traffic to hammer home a header from close range. It was Schmidt's first international goal in her fifth U-17 cap.

The USA had a few more chances to win it in the waning moments, but the three minutes of stoppage time passed and the match went to penalty kicks, setting the stage for the Americans to convert all five of their penalty shots.

The other match of the day featured a 2-2 draw between Mexico and Costa Rica. Mexico won that shootout, 4-1, to earn an additional point, meaning the USA and Mexico are tied atop the 4 Nations Tournament standings with two points each. Canada and Costa Rica each have one point, making the second matchday on Tuesday, July 29, vital towards the tournament title. Mexico, with two goals scored to the USA's one, is currently in first place via that tiebreaker.

The tournament is serving as important World Cup preparation for all teams as each will be competing in the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup later this fall in Morocco. The scheduling of the international matches is a part of the continuing focus on the U.S. Way philosophy which emphasizes increased programming for Youth National Teams to create more opportunities for young players to advance through the pathway to the full U.S. Women's National Team with the goal of representing their country at a world championship.

A landmark US law passed more than 50 years ago helped build the world's most successful national women's football team. Historian Jean Williams explains how Title IX changed the game, and why the rest of the world is still playing catch-up

For decades, the United States has been a dominant force in women's football; soccer. With four World Cup titles and multiple Olympic golds, the US women's national team has become synonymous with international success and sporting achievement.

Meanwhile, their male counterparts – while showing some intermittent signs of growth or progress – have rarely posed a serious threat on the global stage. What explains such a stark divide between the two?

According to historian Jean Williams, speaking on the HistoryExtra podcast, the answer isn't about innate talent or superior tactics: it's about small details within US federal law.

“It's because of a law called Title IX, enacted in 1972,” says Williams.

Passed in 1972 as part of President Richard Nixon's civil rights Education Amendments (the that the Watergate scandal would break, toppling the infamous president two years later), Title IX was designed to prohibit sex-based discrimination in any education programme receiving federal funding. Though not originally intended to transform access to sport, its impact on American athletics – particularly women's sport – was profound.

“It was an education law that stated: if federal funds had been used in any educational facility for male students, an exactly comparable amount had to be used for female activities,” Williams explains.

Across the country, in the wake of Nixon's changes, schools and universities were compelled to provide equal funding for opportunities to girls and women. Crucially, that meant not only equal access to teams, but also to facilities, coaching and financial investment.

And Williams says it had “unintended consequences” for sport.

With colleges keen to bolster their reputations through sporting success, the Title IX changes to the law meant that women's sport now became a viable avenue for a college to stake a claim to athletic greatness.

In particular, this opened the door to sporting scholarships aimed at women – and soccer.

“Soccer was perceived to be less hyper-masculine than American football, and it enabled comparable amounts to be spent on female athletes within colleges. So soccer became a way for the colleges to develop a reputation as a winning college within women's soccer.”

With American colleges spending more on their women's soccer teams, a greater emphasis was placed on the sport, leading to more competitiveness.

So, says Williams, a winning women's soccer team “reflected very well upon a college”, and it was all down to what she calls the “unintended consequences” of Title IX. “Now there were scholarships open that allowed young women to want to go to colleges for their sporting reputations.”

American soccer legend Julie Foudy, two-time FIFA Women's World Cup champion and twice an Olympic gold medallist, is Williams' prime example of the impact.

“Julie Foudy, who was one of the winners of the 1999 World Cup in California, could either go to Stanford to study a medical career or she could go on a soccer scholarship.”

Williams says that Foudy, and US women's soccer team who won the World Cup in 1991, “were the daughters of Title IX.”

But while America was building up its female athletes, the story in football's traditional strongholds was very different.

In England in 1921, the Football Association (FA) banned women from playing on official pitches – a ban that lasted until 1971. In many other parts of Europe, the stigma around women's football persisted into the 1980s and beyond.

“The 1971 unofficial Women's World Cup in Mexico signalled that women's football could go one way or another,” says Williams. As it turned out, even though “the Mexican FA did not want to get involved in women's football,” the hype around the event was real, and organic.

But that tournament – which drew crowds of over 100,000 people in Mexico City – was not officially recognised. Instead of national sides, countries often had to send club teams to represent them. Even these faced obstacles: local associations restricted access to pitches, refused to endorse fixtures, or placed limits on travel and funding.

This fragmented system stunted the growth of elite women's football in Europe for decades – a sharp contrast with the structured, publicly funded development pipeline in the US.

But the story of women's football predates Nixon and predates Mexico.

Decades before Title IX, and before the Women's World Cups of the latter half of the 20th century, a boom in women's football emerged from the First World War.

“With the First World War conscription efforts, the men go to fight on the frontline, but the country still needs munitions made. And young working-class women in their droves went to the factories for two reasons,” explains Williams.

“One is because they earned more money in the factories, although it is exactly half the wages of what the male workers were paid. And the second is that by working outside the home, it gave women a right to leisure outside the home. And so instead of being isolated in somebody else's house, you've got friends who you could start to have a kick about with at breaks.

“And from there the women's football teams emerged.”

However, these women faced almost immediate pushback from England's official sporting institutions, not least of all the FA, who worked to implement an effective ban.

“The FA said that they thought the game of football was unsuitable for women, that women were too delicate.”

“In 1921,” Williams continues, “the FA issued a ban on women playing on any pitch affiliated to the football association. And that included the big stadium, but it also included your little local club sites.”

How did these women react? First, they tried to play on other grounds – but the FA still wasn't content to leave them be. Williams says, “When women then went on to try and play in cricket grounds and rugby grounds, the FA used its influence with other sports to prevent women from playing on any sports ground, which effectively pushed it underground.”

Now, however, women's football is once again firmly on the rise across the world, with the increasing backing of football's biggest institutions. And after the success of England's Women's team in the 2022 Euros, Williams says there's no looking back.

“The victories in 2022 were huge. It was seismic.”

She concludes, “It was a huge moment where it proved that women's football could sell out major stadiums, it could get the whole country behind the women's national team.”

For any player looking to make a significant contribution at the 2026 FIFA World Cup, playing regular minutes and being in form is a must. 

While many of the U.S. men's national team players have sorted out their club situations or are already key contributors, the same can't be said for Matt Turner, who seems to have lost his grasp on the starting goalkeeper role under head coach Mauricio Pochettino. 

Through the 2024–25 season, the 31-year-old struggled to find time on loan with Crystal Palace from Nottingham Forest, playing only three games. Meanwhile, he struggled at the Concacaf Nations League with the USMNT and was surpassed by New York City FC's Matt Freese at the Concacaf Gold Cup. 

Now, after nearly securing a move to Lyon in France's Ligue 1, he might be out of luck. While the club were keen to bring him in as a replacement for Lucas Perri, their financial situation has proven problematic, and they have taken on legal help to cancel the transfer worth a reported $9.4 million. 

Previously, the financial situation had relegated the French giants to Ligue 2, before an appeal saw them reinstated into the top flight, albeit on hard times. 

Yet, the issues facing Turner are two-fold. First, he has to sort out which club he belongs to, and at the same time, navigate the right path towards consistent playing time at a high level, to keep his place on the USMNT. 

Here are three options he could take.

The most straightforward and primary option for Turner would be that Lyon complete the transfer from Nottingham Forest, regardless of their current financial situation. From Turner's perspective, it would allow him to be a top-choice goalkeeper in Europe for the first time, replacing Perri, who recently joined Premier League side Leeds United. 

Currently, Lyon have Lassine Diarra, Mathieu Patouillet and Remy Deschamps under contract, with Deschamps the only one to have played first-team games for the club, but likely to be the backup under Turner, should the transfer go through. 

When Turner moved from Forest to Crystal Palace on loan, the hope was that he may be able to get a few more minutes and battle for a key role. Yet, he never challenged Dean Henderson for the starting spot, and faded into the background of Palace's plans, even as USMNT teammate Chris Richards thrived at center back. 

However, should the transfer be cancelled, a loan to the lower levels in England could be in the cards, albeit a potential step down from the level he should be competing at if he hopes to be the starting goalkeeper for the USMNT. 

Leaving Europe might not entice many, but it could be the right path for Turner, after his so-far unsuccessful foray into UEFA. Previously, he was a star with the New England Revolution, and would likely slide right into a starting role if he were to return to that club. 

Other potential clubs that could look at a new starting goalkeeper include the San Jose Earthquakes, Atlanta United and D.C. United, with others having the potential to open up a spot should they view Turner, who has expressed his openness to an MLS return, as an option. 

Turner's struggles in England aren't the first time for an American goalkeeper, and a return to MLS could match a similar path to Zack Steffen, who failed to crack regular minutes with Manchester City before returning to MLS as a star goalkeeper with the Colorado Rapids.

The global soccer players' union hit back at FIFA and its president Gianni Infantino on Friday, saying their autocratic style of leadership was harming the rights of its members.

“Football needs responsible leadership, not emperors,” the FIFPRO network said after a meeting of 58 national player unions responded to FIFA pursuing its agenda with unofficial player representatives.

Watch NBC 5 free wherever you are

“It needs fewer autocratic monologues and more genuine, inclusive and transparent dialogue,” the union added.

FIFA announced two weeks ago it reached a consensus on key issues after Infantino hosted a group of mostly non-recognized officials in New York ahead of the Club World Cup final.

The latest rift between soccer's governing body and its players' unions flared while the European Commission in Brussels is considering a formal complaint against FIFA. It was filed by FIFPRO's European division and national leagues in Europe against FIFA's style of governance and decision-making.

FIFA denounced what it called Friday the union leadership's “increasingly divisive and contradictory tone"" in pursuing a public relations battle ""to preserve their own personal positions and interests.""

FIFPRO said Friday its core concerns included an overloaded global match calendar with too many games for elite players, lack of physical and mental recovery periods and extreme playing conditions.

Players at the month-long Club World Cup in the United States reported feeling dizzy and unwell in the heat of daytime games played to appeal to worldwide TV audiences.



The 63-game tournament backed by Saudi Arabian money was lucrative for clubs, especially in Europe, though FIFA added it to the schedule without formally consulting players.

The tournament, FIFPRO said, was “celebrated by President Infantino despite being held under conditions that were extreme and inappropriate for any human being, demonstrating a troubling insensitivity to human rights, even when it concerns elite athletes.

“FIFPRO reaffirmed its unwavering commitment to protecting the rights of men and women players — rights which are being seriously undermined by commercial policies imposed by its autocratic system of governance,” the Netherlands-based union said of FIFA.

“This is a model that puts the health of players at risk and sidelines those at the heart of the game,” FIFPRO said, adding it was “unacceptable for an organization that claims global leadership to turn a blind eye to the basic needs of the players.”

FIFA responded by challenging the union to publish its statutes and “transparent annual accounts.”

“Let us be clear: you cannot preach transparency while operating in opacity,” the world soccer body said.

FIFPRO has not had a formal working agreement with FIFA since the previous one expired in 2023.","{'href': 'https://www.nbcdfw.com', 'title': 'NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth'}","soccer"

Major League Soccer side Columbus Crew have signed FIFA Club World Cup star Wessam Abou Ali from Egyptian club Al Ahly FC. Transfermarkt understands that the Crew will pay an initial $7.5 million (€6.4m) plus $2m (€1.7m) if Abou Ali scores 15 goals for his new club. The deal also includes a 15% sell-on clause. The initial fee alone makes Abou Ali the third most expensive signing in the Crew's history. Abou Ali has signed a contract until 2027 with an option for 2028. Abou Ali becomes just the third Palestinian national team player in MLS history and the most expensive Palestinian in history.

“Wessam is a special player whose journey speaks to his resilience, character, and tireless work ethic, which are qualities we value at our Club,” Columbus Crew general manager Issa Tell said in a club statement. “He is a proven goal-scorer who knows what it takes to help his team win.

Finally, in 2024, the Danish striker who represents Palestine internationally joined Egyptian powerhouse Al Ahly. There, he scored 38 goals and provided ten assists in 60 games across all competitions. The 26-year-old burst onto the world scene during the FIFA Club World Cup, where he scored a hattrick in the 4-4 draw against Porto.

Who is Abou Ali? Columbus Crew sign forward with great free kick ability
What sort of player is Abou Ali? “He is an advanced forward who usually plays in the spaces in opponents' back-line,” Egypt data scout at Transfermarkt, Osama Rakha, said. “For years, Al Ahly struggled with set pieces, but Abou Ali solved that with his excellent free kick abilities, scoring important goals in the CAF Champions League and Egyptian Premier League. There is no doubt that Wessam is a top star for Al Ahly, winning the Egyptian Premier League top scorer award within six months of joining the club, scoring 18 goals and providing six assists in just 19 games. Last year, he missed some time with an injury but came back in top form.”
With all that in mind, it isn't surprising that Abou Ali has become a significant star both in Palestine and Egypt. Indeed, Al Ahly fought hard to keep the player, and it took a player strike on Abou Ali's part to facilitate the transfer. Despite the dramatic ending, Al Ahly managed to capitalize on the situation. The €6.4m initially received will make Abou Ali the second most expensive departure in Al Ahly's club history, and should he hit his bonuses, he could break a record set by Malick Evouna during the 2016/17 season (overview).

Alex Phillips was speaking after FIFPro held a meeting in Amsterdam with 58 national player unions from around the world to discuss concerns over the way the sport's world governing body FIFA is managing global football.

The meeting came less than two weeks after the end of the first 32-team Club World Cup in the United States, a tournament hailed as a huge success by FIFA president Gianni Infantino but criticised by FIFPro for the demands it has placed on players already faced with a crowded schedule.

""Before the Club World Cup, I was speaking to some of the top stars and they were saying they hadn't had a rest for 'X' amount of time,"" Phillips said.

""One of them even said, 'I'll only get a rest when I get injured'. Others were resigned actually, and cynical about speaking up.

""Then you see some of the same players two weeks later having to record social media videos saying 'We think the Club World Cup is great,' because their employers are telling them to do it.

""You have this contradictory situation where players can't speak up. They are in an invidious position. They can speak up but it might have consequences.""

FIFPro said that FIFA's recent focus on the Club World Cup in the United States was an example of the body ignoring many fundamentally more important issues facing players around the world.

""It is unacceptable for an organisation that claims global leadership to turn a blind eye to the basic needs of the players,"" FIFPro said in a statement, notably citing the ""overloaded"" match calendar, heat concerns at the Club World Cup and an ""ongoing disregard for players' social rights"".

FIFPro Europe filed a complaint to the European Commission last year accusing FIFA of abusing its position with regards to its handling of the international match calendar.

The summit hosted by the union on Friday came after it was left out of a meeting held by FIFA on the eve of the recent Club World Cup final.

Sergio Marchi, the Argentinian president of FIFPro, this week slammed Infantino's leadership of FIFA and accused him of running an ""autocracy"" in an interview with The Athletic.

FIFA hit back at FIFPro in a statement on Friday as it called for dialogue ""with legitimate bodies that put player welfare first"" and said it had tried unsuccessfully to get the union to attend its meeting in New York on July 12.

""FIFA is extremely disappointed by the increasingly divisive and contradictory tone adopted by FIFPRO leadership,"" the Zurich-based organisation said.

""This approach clearly shows that rather than engaging in constructive dialogue, FIFPRO has chosen to pursue a path of public confrontation,"" which aims to preserve ""their own personal positions and interests.""","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","soccer"

England captain Leah Williamson (left) missed the 2023 World Cup final because of  an anterior cruciate ligament injury

England will be seeking redemption in Sunday's Euro 2025 final when they take on Spain in a repeat of the World Cup final two years ago.

Sarina Wiegman's side are in their third successive major final after winning Euro 2022 before Spain beat them to become world champions in 2023.

It is the first time Spain's women - who were knocked out in the quarter-finals in 2022 by England - have reached a European Championship final.

England captain Leah Williamson says they are aware of ""what it means to the nation"" and they will do everything they can to bring home the trophy.

The Lionesses are hoping to become the first team in the history of English football to win a major trophy on foreign soil when they line up in the final in Basel, Switzerland at 17:00 BST.

""The opportunity [on Sunday] and what's on offer is the best thing in football,"" said Williamson. 

""We wanted to be here until the end and have a chance to win the trophy. We don't carry the weight of it - but we're aware of it because it means the same to us. 

""We recognise the opportunity and we'll do everything we can to do it.""

Williamson was not part of England's defeat by Spain in the World Cup final because of an anterior cruciate ligament injury.

She said it was an ""awful"" experience to watch the final in Sydney and not being able to help.

""I know how tired you are when you get to that stage, and how much a tournament takes out of you - and to be completely useless, that probably bothered me the most,"" she added.

""But that feels like a really long time ago, which is probably a benefit to the whole squad. 

""Anybody would give anything to be a part of their team when they're going through moments like that. It was tough.""

It will be just the second time the same teams have met in back-to-back women's World Cup and European Championship finals, after Germany faced Sweden in 2001 and 2003.

They have played each other three times previously at the Euros, with England winning the last two meetings in 2017 and 2022.

The two nations also met in this year's Women's Nations League - England won 1-0 at Wembley in February before Spain beat them 2-1 in Barcelona in June.

""We've played each other a lot over the last couple of years. You always have learnings. They will have learned from us,"" said Wiegman. 

""Sunday is a new situation so hopefully we can exploit some of the weaknesses they have too. I just know that going into a final is already very, very special.""

England not 'clear underdogs' against Spain - Williamson

Spain have won each of their last 10 matches in all competitions, scoring 38 goals. 

They last enjoyed a longer winning run between March 2020 and November 2021, when they won 16 games consecutively.

The world champions are the highest-ranked side in the competition and have not lost a game at Euro 2025.

England are ranked fifth in the world and lost their opening group game against France.

They needed a penalty shootout to overcome Sweden in the quarter-finals and scored a last-minute goal in extra time to beat Italy in the semi-final.

But Williamson says there is no underdog, despite Spain being many people's pre-tournament favourites.

""We play a game against the world champions who continue to prove themselves over and over in the way they play,"" said Williamson. 

""They are fantastic footballing team and they are the best at what they do and we're very much aware of that. We think we're pretty good in areas as well. 

""We need to be at our best to beat Spain. I think they need to be at their best to beat us too. There is a lot of respect between the two teams. 

""I would be hesitant to say there's an underdog in this scenario. It's not an easy job. We will prepare ourselves as best we can for that challenge.""

England lost 1-0 to Spain in the 2023 Women's World Cup final

Spain arrived in Switzerland as the pre-tournament favourites, with Opta predicting they had a 25% chance of winning the title.

""We don't like the idea of being favourites. We know what it takes to be here, what we suffered, we have to be focused,"" Spain captain Irene Paredes said.

However, La Roja underlined their credentials as favourites further by storming past Portugal, Belgium and Italy by an aggregate score of 14-3.

They saw off a spirited Switzerland side in the quarter-finals before moving past Germany thanks to an extra-time winner as they beat the eight-time European champions for the first time in their history.

""During the whole tournament we have been writing history,"" said Spain boss Montse Tome.

""Getting to the semis and the final for the first time, beating Germany for the first time. We have been accomplishing objectives and that's the reason we're here.""

Spain could become the first European nation to lift the World Cup and the Euros at back-to-back tournaments since Germany won five in a row between 2001 and 2009.

""We are a team who don't see this game as a pressure but as an opportunity to continue writing history, do something big and to let people enjoy it,"" Paredes added.

Not only is it a chance for Spain to continue writing history, but winning would allow the players to celebrate properly - without the cloud of controversy that followed their World Cup win hanging over the group.

Lauren James was a doubt this week after coming off at half-time in England's semi-final win against Italy with an ankle injury.

But she was in full training on Saturday and Wiegman said all 23 players ""came through"" the session.

The Chelsea forward has scored two goals at the tournament and was a standout performer in the group stages.

Arsenal winger Chloe Kelly has a goal and an assist in five substitute appearances, while teenager Michelle Agyemang has netted two goals when coming off the bench on three occasions. 

After being discharged from hospital just days before the Euros started after suffering from viral meningitis, Aitana Bonmati had to be patient to make her mark. 

But the Barcelona midfielder turned up when it mattered, scoring an extra-time winner against Germany to send Spain to their first Euro final.

Fellow Barca midfielder Alexia Putellas, meanwhile, has been in top form since the beginning - scoring three goals and assisting another four, while she has also created more chances (18) than any other player.

Apart from Spain's pair of two-time Ballon d'Or winners, striker Esther Gonzalez is the tournament's top scorer with four goals in five games. 

Michelle Agyemang has scored two goals as a substitute in Euro 2025

Gonzalez is also hoping to win the Golden Boot as the tournament's top-scorer, with her biggest challenger her team-mate Putellas just a goal behind.

No England player has netted more than two goals in the tournament.

There will also be competition for the Golden Ball, with several Spain players impressing, including Putellas - while England's Lucy Bronze and Hannah Hampton have been standout players.

The Golden Glove for the most clean sheets is tied between Spain goalkeeper Cata Coll and Sweden's Jennifer Falk.

Spain have kept three clean sheets as a team but Adriana Nanclares started the 5-0 win over Portugal in the group stage so Coll will need to keep out England if she is to win the award outright.

Meanwhile, England's Agyemang is one of the favourites to win the young player of the tournament award, with Spain's Vicky Lopez, Switzerland's Iman Beney and Norway's Signe Gaupset her main competition.

Inter Miami CF announced today it has signed Argentine midfielder Rodrigo De Paul from Spanish giants Club Atlético de Madrid. De Paul will initially join the Club on loan through the 2025 Major League Soccer (MLS) season; the deal includes an option to make the transfer permanent through the 2029 MLS season.

The World Cup champion and two-time CONMEBOL Copa América winner, regarded as one of the best in the world in his position, brings world-class quality to the midfield and adds elite, title-winning experience to the squad. The 31-year-old, nicknamed El Motorcito (the little engine) for his tireless work rate, will join the squad and begin training with the team upon the receipt of his P-1 Visa and ITC.

“Assembling a team that inspires our fans to dream continues to be one of our primary aspirations, so we're thrilled to sign a player of Rodrigo's caliber. He is a winner who has conquered the world stage; his ambitions match ours at Inter Miami, and we are hungry to achieve these goals together,” said Managing Owner Jorge Mas. “Several of the best players in global fútbol have already chosen Inter Miami as their home, and Rodrigo joining our roster is another landmark as we continue on this journey to change the trajectory of the sport in this country and make our fans proud.”

“Rodrigo is a player I've admired for many years. As a leader he has brought so much to the teams he has played for - especially with his national team Argentina. He brings experience, passion and quality to our team and to our city. I'm excited to welcome another World Cup winning player not just to Inter Miami, but also to MLS,"" said Co-Owner David Beckham.

“What brings me to Inter Miami is the desire to compete, win titles, to write the pages in the Club's history,” said De Paul. “It's a Club that is shaping up to be great, to have a long history, so that many people follow this incredible team.”

After the highly anticipated announcement of his signing, Inter Miami CF's newest addition, world-class Argentine international midfielder Rodrigo De Paul, will be unveiled to the Club's passionate fans during Saturday's pregame at 7 p.m. ET at Chase Stadium. Don't miss the chance to give a warm welcome to ‘El Motorcito' this Saturday, July 26, and secure your tickets for the Inter Miami vs. FC Cincinnati match HERE!

De Paul joins Inter Miami with a formidable resume both at the club and international levels. Internationally, he was one of the main figures alongside Inter Miami captain Lionel Messi in Argentina's historic 2022 FIFA World Cup title, as well as in La Albiceleste's 2021 and 2024 CONMEBOL Copa América and 2022 CONMEBOL-UEFA Cup of Champions conquests. At the club level, the midfield engine has racked up nearly 500 appearances across all competitions and tallied 57 goals and 74 assists, representing Racing Club in his native Argentina (2012-2014, 2016 on loan) before an accomplished spell in Europe, playing for Valencia CF (2014-2016), Udinese (2016-2021) and Club Atlético de Madrid (2021-2025).

The versatile midfielder has also earned various individual accolades throughout his successful career. Notably, he earned Copa América 2021 and 2024 Team of the Tournament honors, and most recently featured in the LaLiga Team of the Season for the 2024-25 campaign.

The Sarandí, Buenos Aires, Argentina native began his career in the youth ranks at Racing Club prior to being promoted to the first team and making his professional debut in February 2013. De Paul went on to establish himself as a key player for Racing over the next seasons before embarking on a new chapter in European fútbol in 2014. In all, he totalled 72 appearances across all competitions in two stints for Racing (he briefly returned on loan in 2016), contributing seven goals and seven assists. In his time at Racing, he faced current Inter Miami goalkeeper Óscar Ustari in an Argentine First Division match in 2013 when he was a Club Atlético Boca Juniors player.

Starting in 2014, De Paul developed a successful career in Europe. First, he played 44 matches and recorded two goals and four assists in two seasons for historic Spanish side Valencia, before making a move to Italian Serie A side Udinese. The midfielder flourished as a leader in his five seasons in Italy, donning the captain's armband for I Bianconeri, making 184 total appearances across all competitions, scoring 34 goals and dishing out 37 assists.

In 2021, De Paul signed for Los Colchoneros in the Spanish capital and became an integral piece in midfield. In all, he racked 187 appearances, 14 goals, and 26 assists across all competitions for Atlético in a spell in which he notably played alongside new Inter Miami teammate Luis Suárez during the 2021-22 season. Additionally, during his two spells in Spain, he faced current Inter Miami head coach Javier Mascherano, defender Jordi Alba, midfielder Sergio Busquets, Messi, and Suárez on multiple occasions in their days as FC Barcelona players.

On the international stage, De Paul made his debut for Argentina's national team in 2018 and has gone on to earn 78 caps, scoring two times, in a fruitful era for La Albiceleste. The midfielder was fundamental to helping Argentina clinch four major titles, winning the 2022 FIFA World Cup to earn a historic third crown for the nation, the 2021 and 2024 CONMEBOL Copa América titles, and the 2022 CONMEBOL-UEFA Cup of Champions title. In that span, De Paul and Inter Miami captain Messi have shared the pitch a total of 62 times for their country's senior side.","{'href': 'https://www.intermiamicf.com', 'title': 'Inter Miami CF'}","soccer"

The global soccer players' union hit back at FIFA and its president Gianni Infantino on Friday, saying their autocratic style of leadership was harming the rights of its members.

“Football needs responsible leadership, not emperors,” the FIFPRO network said after a meeting of 58 national player unions responded to FIFA pursuing its agenda with unofficial player representatives.

“It needs fewer autocratic monologues and more genuine, inclusive and transparent dialogue,” the union added.

FIFA announced two weeks ago it reached a consensus on key issues after Infantino hosted a group of mostly non-recognized officials in New York ahead of the Club World Cup final.

The latest rift between soccer's governing body and its players' unions flared while the European Commission in Brussels is considering a formal complaint against FIFA. It was filed by FIFPRO's European division and national leagues in Europe against FIFA's style of governance and decision-making.

FIFA denounced what it called Friday the union leadership's “increasingly divisive and contradictory tone"" in pursuing a public relations battle ""to preserve their own personal positions and interests.""

FIFPRO said Friday its core concerns included an overloaded global match calendar with too many games for elite players, lack of physical and mental recovery periods and extreme playing conditions.

Players at the month-long Club World Cup in the United States reported feeling dizzy and unwell in the heat of daytime games played to appeal to worldwide TV audiences.



The 63-game tournament backed by Saudi Arabian money was lucrative for clubs, especially in Europe, though FIFA added it to the schedule without formally consulting players.

The tournament, FIFPRO said, was “celebrated by President Infantino despite being held under conditions that were extreme and inappropriate for any human being, demonstrating a troubling insensitivity to human rights, even when it concerns elite athletes.

“FIFPRO reaffirmed its unwavering commitment to protecting the rights of men and women players — rights which are being seriously undermined by commercial policies imposed by its autocratic system of governance,” the Netherlands-based union said of FIFA.

“This is a model that puts the health of players at risk and sidelines those at the heart of the game,” FIFPRO said, adding it was “unacceptable for an organization that claims global leadership to turn a blind eye to the basic needs of the players.”

FIFA responded by challenging the union to publish its statutes and “transparent annual accounts.”

“Let us be clear: you cannot preach transparency while operating in opacity,” the world soccer body said.

FIFPRO has not had a formal working agreement with FIFA since the previous one expired in 2023.","{'href': 'https://www.nbcboston.com', 'title': 'NBC Boston'}","soccer"

Home > Morocco > Lekjaa: 2030 World Cup Final Venue Not Yet Decided

Fouzi Lekjaa has refuted recent reports claiming that Madrid's Santiago Bernabeu stadium has been selected to host the 2030 World Cup final.

Marrakech – Fouzi Lekjaa, president of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) and head of the 2030 World Cup organizing committee, has refuted recent reports claiming that Madrid's Santiago Bernabeu stadium has been selected to host the 2030 World Cup final.

Speaking on a special program broadcast on Morocco's Al Aoula channel Friday evening, Lekjaa clarified that the selection of stadiums for the tournament remains subject to negotiations between the three host countries – Morocco, Spain, and Portugal – in coordination with FIFA.

“Decisions related to the World Cup are not made by club presidents, but by the organizing committees of the three countries in coordination with FIFA,” Lekjaa stated.

He pointed out that “the press is free to publish what it wants, but what is certain, until now, is that Morocco, Spain, and Portugal have earned the honor of organizing this global event.”

The FRMF president asserted that no official decision has been made regarding the distribution of matches or the selection of the stadium for the final.

This comes in response to Spanish media reports suggesting that FIFA had chosen the Santiago Bernabeu stadium to host the tournament's final match.

According to the Spanish website Defensa Central, Real Madrid had reportedly received confirmation from FIFA about renting the historic stadium for the final, citing its technological development and large capacity of over 80,000 spectators.

During the interview, Lekjaa suggested that “the opening and final will take place in the largest stadium ready for the 2030 World Cup,” a statement that positions Morocco's Grand Benslimane Stadium, officially known as Hassan II Stadium, as a logical favorite.

Morocco builds the world's biggest stadium

Currently under construction near Casablanca, this project – with a capacity exceeding 115,000 spectators – is considered by far the largest of its kind in the world, making it a strong contender against Madrid's Santiago Bernabeu and Barcelona's Spotify Camp Nou.

The construction of Benslimane Stadium is expected to be completed by the end of 2027. Moroccan construction companies TGCC and SGTM were awarded the second lot of the project in June, in a deal valued at MAD 3.2 billion ($320 million).

The stadium will take the form of a massive white tent embodying the “moussem culture” and will be connected to a network of highways and public transportation, along with sports facilities, including a “green fields village” and recreational facilities.

Lekjaa also spotlighted the North African country's golden era in football, both at the national team and club levels on the continental stage. He noted that “the boom in Moroccan football today is reinforced by modern infrastructure, which will enable us to continue to excel and win titles in the future.”

The FRMF president reminded that Morocco has become a central player in African and international football. “The Kingdom is now a host for major competitions. This is not a slogan, it's a reality being built on the ground,” he said during the broadcast.

The 2030 World Cup will be jointly hosted by Morocco, Spain, and Portugal, with stadium selection subject to strict criteria including capacity, infrastructure, technological readiness, safety, comfort, and sustainability.

The final decision will be based on a collective agreement between all concerned parties, with consideration for fair distribution of important matches among the three host countries.

Taberner – Darderi: 26.07.2025 20:00 CEST
H2H: first meeting

Carlos Taberner has won four of his last five matches. Last week in Gstaad, the Spaniard lost against Carballes Baena in the opening round in three tight sets. This week in Umag, Taberner had a favourable draw, defeating Herbert in the opening round in straight sets. He lost his serve only once. In the second round, the Spaniard upset Cerundolo in three tight sets after playing for over three hours. After losing the opening set 6-7, Taberner stepped up his level and turned the match around. His serve was untouchable in the quarterfinals against de Jong. Taberner won in straight sets, not offering any breakpoints. Yesterday in the semifinals, Dzumhur had no chance against him. Taberner dropped only three games throughout the match. This is his second appearance in Umag. In his debut campaign, 2021, Taberner defeated Travaglia in the second round.

Luciano Darderi has won eight straight matches. Last week in Bastad, the Italian won the title, winning against de Jong in the final in three tight sets. He continued his best tennis this week in Umag as well. In the opening round, Darderi defeated Tseng in straight sets. He offered and saved two breakpoints. After winning the opening set 7-5, Darderi demolished Tseng in the second set. In the quarterfinals, Prizmic won the opening set 6-1 against Darderi. However, the Italian stayed calm and turned the match around. Yesterday in the semifinals, Darderi saved both breakpoints he offered and defeated Ugo Carabelli in straight sets comfortably.  This is his second appearance in Umag. Last season, Darderi lost against Mensik in the second round in straight sets.

According to the bookies, Taberner is the underdog in this matchup, but we disagree. He is in great form and has dominated this week against everyone. On the other hand, Darderi is also in great form, but we had some inconsistent performances this week. We believe if Taberner plays his best tennis, he will keep this match tight.

That being said, Taberner covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Carlos Taberner +3.5 games handicap @1.80 @bet365

Carlos Taberner's serve was never a weapon. He served only six aces altogether this week in Umag. Darderi has a solid return, and we expect him to win at least one point in every game of the opening set.

That being said, Darderi winning at least one point in every game in set 1 is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Luciano Darderi to win 1+ points in every game in set 1 @-180 @FanDuel

The rivalry between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz has become the main focus of men's tennis especially this year, as the Italian and the Spaniard faced each other in the final at both Roland Garros and the Wimbledon Championships.

Their battle in Paris was electrifying from all points of view and is destined to remain a feat in the memory of fans, not only because it was the longest final in the history of the French Slam. The 23-year-old Italian was really one step away from the feat and had three match points in a row in the fourth set, but his top rival did not give up and prevailed in the fifth set after almost five and a half hours.

The world number 1 took revenge over the 22-year-old Spaniard in the Wimbledon final a couple of weeks ago, proving to be superior despite losing the first set in a rather mocking way.

The hope of fans around the world is that there will be a new chapter in this amazing rivalry already at the US Open at the end of the summer, with Jannik who will be called upon to defend the title won in New York a year ago. The Big Apple also evokes good memories in the mind of Carlos, who won the first Grand Slam title of his young career right there in 2022. In that edition, the ace from Murcia defeated Sinner at the end of an epic clash in the quarterfinals.

In an interview with 'TRM', former ATP ace and current coach Renzo Furlan discussed the rivalry between Sinner and Alcaraz: ""Both are eager to improve and push themselves to the limit, as always happens when there is such an important rivalry. There is no doubt that these two players are several steps above the others right now and – if there are no surprises – they will be the benchmarks of men's tennis in the coming years as well. It is not excluded that there may be the rise of some other player like Lorenzo Musetti or Ben Shelton.""

Coming into the contest on the back of 16 wins from his last 18 matches on Tour, Bublik produced another assured display on the Austrian clay, beating Cazaux 6-4, 6-3 in just 86 minutes.

The 28-year-old won 84% of points behind his first serve, overpowering his opponent with 26 winners across the two sets.

It continues a remarkable resurgence for Bublik, who has already claimed silverware in Halle and Gstaad this summer, as well as reaching the last eight at Roland Garros.

""I can't believe I did it as it was probably one of the toughest weeks in my life because coming from Gstaad, playing here, different conditions and raining,"" Bublik said in his on-court interview.

""I am pleased I got through and thank you for supporting me throughout the tournament.""

The Kazakh will be keen to carry his momentum into the American hard-court swing, as he looks to climb into the top 20 and surpass his career-high ranking of world number 17.","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","tennis"

Royal fans were delighted when Kate Middleton attended Wimbledon solo on July 12 to watch the women's singles final. For the occasion, Princess Kate wore a white Self-Portrait dress, which she accessorized with an Anya Hindmarch tote bag and Gianvito Rossi suede pumps. Now, a royal source has revealed how the Princess of Wales felt when she received a standing ovation after arriving at Wimbledon.

Speaking to Us Weekly, a royal source said of the moment, ""[Kate] felt really good, and it reinforced her recovery and that everyone is rooting for her."" The source continued, ""She doesn't follow the press so to get a real-world reaction was incredibly fulfilling for her.""

The source further elaborated, ""The ovation at Wimbledon was unexpected... [Kate was] really surprised and felt humbled by it.""



""The ovation at Wimbledon was unexpected.""

As the royal patron of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, and an enthusiastic tennis fan, Princess Kate is a regular attendee at Wimbledon. The Princess of Wales even made an unexpected appearance at the sporting event in 2024, while undergoing preventative chemotherapy treatment following a cancer diagnosis. As a result, it's completely understandable that the crowd celebrated Princess Kate's return to the tournament, and her recovery from cancer, by giving her a standing ovation.

The Princess of Wales returned to Wimbledon on July 13 with husband Prince William, and two of their three children—Prince George and Princess Charlotte. While Prince Louis sadly missed the action, Princess Kate seemed delighted to be attending the high-profile event for a second day.

For her second 2025 appearance at Wimbledon, Kate wore a royal blue V-neck dress, which she paired with her wide-brimmed, ribbon-trimmed hat from L.K. Bennett—an item beloved by Marie Claire's senior royal editor, Kristin Contino. Unfortunately, Kate's exact hat has since sold out, but similar items remain available for anyone hoping to replicate her regal style.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Dominic Thiem names four players who he thinks can beat Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner if they play 'perfectly'","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/dominic-thiem-names-four-players-who-he-thinks-can-beat-carlos-alcaraz-and-jannik-sinner-if-they-play-perfectly/","Sat, 26 Jul 2025 20:00:00 GMT","

After meeting in two consecutive Grand Slam finals, Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner will be the overwhelming favourites to reach the championship match at the US Open. 

Alcaraz and Sinner played out another classic in the final of Wimbledon earlier this month, following their five-set thriller at Roland Garros, which lasted five hours and 29 minutes. 

The two have split the last seven major titles between them, and look set to dominate men's tennis for years to come. 

However, former US Open champion Dominic Thiem thinks there are four players who can stop the ‘new two' at Flushing Meadows in September. 

In an interview with ‘Cronache di Tennis‘, Thiem said: “The finals at Roland Garros and Wimbledon were incredible. They raised the bar of this sport beyond what we were used to.

“They play faster and faster, but they make fewer mistakes and move better and better. I didn't expect two more generational talents to arrive so quickly after the Big Three. And Novak is still playing.”

“Today they're too far ahead. Then they, too, can lose: we saw it with Grigor Dimitrov at Wimbledon, or even Alexander Zverev, Taylor Fritz, and Jack Draper, if they play perfectly.

“I doubt they'll win every Slam in the next 10 years, but today they're one step ahead of everyone.

“I would have liked to play against Alcaraz and Sinner in my prime. I don't know how it would have ended, but we would have had fun.”

In 2025 so far, Alcaraz has played 54 matches on the ATP Tour and has lost just six of them. 

His first defeat of the season came at the Australian Open, where he bowed out in the quarter-finals to Novak Djokovic. 

During February and March, he suffered defeats in three consecutive tournaments, losing to Jiri Lehecka in Qatar, Jack Draper in Indian Wells, and David Goffin in Miami.

At the Barcelona Open, he was beaten in the final by Holger Rune, before going on a 24-match winning streak, which ended in the Wimbledon final against Sinner. 

The world number one, on the other hand, has only lost three times this season, the first of which came in the Italian Open final at the hands of Alcaraz.

After losing to the Spaniard again in the Roland Garros final, his most recent defeat was to Alexander Bublik in Halle. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'thetennisgazette.com'}","tennis"

The 22-year-old Dane missed out on a place in the semi-finals when she lost 3-6, 5-7 to Russian outsider Anna Kalinskaya on Saturday night.

As the fourth seed in the tournament, Tauson went into the game as favorite against Kalinskaya, who is four years her senior and ranked No 48 in the world while Tauson is ranked 19th.  

Tauson quickly fell behind in the first set, where she was broken three times in her own serve.

In the second set, Tauson still couldn't get her game going against the strong Kalinskaya, and the Dane trailed 3-5 after a new Russian service breakthrough.

In the next game, the Dane broke to 4-5, and a little later she also equalized to 5-5 giving her hope of a possible comeback, but it was quickly extinguished.

On the other side of the net, Kalinskaya got hold of herself and the Russian won the next two games to close out the match.","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","tennis"

B.C.-born Canadian tennis player Vasek Pospisil plans to retire at 35 after the National Bank Open.Christinne Muschi/The Canadian Press

As Canadian tennis player Vasek Pospisil is set to retire at the National Bank Open at age 35, his father Milos can't pick one favourite memory from his son's career. 

Maybe it was trekking to tournaments together in a small Winnebago, seeing him win a Wimbledon doubles title, or watching him upset then World No.1 Andy Murray at Indian Wells. 

But it's hard to top the feeling of seeing his son represent Canada in Davis Cup and help the country win its first title in 2022. Especially since Vasek was the first of his three sons to be born in Canada after the family escaped from the former Czechoslovakia and made a life in Vernon, B.C.

“That was such a big deal for us as immigrants from former Czechoslovakia, to give something back,” said Milos Pospisil, who had coached his son until age 20. “You could tell by watching Vasek playing Davis Cup what it meant to him to represent Canada.”

Milos and his wife Mila are in Toronto this weekend to watch their son play his final tournament, along with other family and friends. It's fitting, as the player himself recognizes he could never have made it without the family's sacrifices. The father once quit his job at the local brewery to coach him full time and help him reach a pro tennis career, even sold their home to finance the way.

“It's very important that my family is here, because I was a long shot, and it was like a family project for me to make it,” said Pospisil. “It was just as much my dad's success, as mine, and for the whole family.”

Pospisil sifts through a lifetime of tennis memories. He started out young, playing on concrete courts in Vernon, with his dad as his coach. He tested himself against his older brothers. There weren't many others playing tennis in the area at the time. 

They found clever ways to save money in an expensive sport over the years. In Europe, the father bought a used Honda Civic so they could travel by car as much as possible. When in North America, they got a small diesel Winnebago to travel everywhere from California to Florida, stopping at rest areas along the U.S. freeways. They drove through cold places too, and the heat would sometimes conk out. The youngster would make them both coffee.

“I have incredible memories with my dad,” said Pospisil. “Just an incredible childhood, and I'm very fortunate to have the family that I do.”

Later on, Tennis Canada helped support them. During his 18-year career on the ATP Tour, Pospisil reached a career-high No. 25 singles ranking in 2014. He won seven ATP Tour doubles titles and reached three singles finals, in Washington (2014), Sofia and Montpellier (both 2020). He was named the ATP's Comeback Player of the Year in 2020.

Pospisil helped provide one of the most memorable moments in recent Canadian Open history when he reached the semi-finals as a qualifier in Montreal in 2013 and lost an all-Canadian showdown to Milos Raonic. Along the way, the slogan “Anything is Pospisil” came to characterize the player.

After breakout tennis season, anything is Pospisil

In doubles, he won Wimbledon alongside American teammate Jack Sock in 2014 – a duo known as ‘The Pop-Socks.” He was the doubles No. 4 player in the world in 2015.

Representing Canada, he was a two-time Olympian (2012 and 2016) and played in 35 Davis Cup ties from 2008 to 2025. He'd begun as a 17-year-old who idolized Canadian doubles star Daniel Nestor and got to team up with him several times. His last tie for Canada was earlier this year in Montreal, where he partnered with Davis Cup rookie Liam Draxl. 

Felix Auger-Aliassime, who played a key role in Canada's Davis Cup title, says it was fun to see Pospisil celebrating it.

“I was so happy to play my part, because he deserved it for how much he's given to Team Canada,” said Auger-Aliassime. “I mean, playing ties all over the world. . .me watching that as a kid inspired me to one day play for the team.”

Pospisil also made his mark as an advocate for players' rights, joining Novak Djokovic in founding the first-ever Professional Tennis Players Association in 2019. 

Earlier this year, along with the PTPA, he filed an antitrust lawsuit against the main governing bodies of professional tennis.

While he doesn't regret for a minute spending his energy on the PTPA work, he admits it distracted from his work on the court in recent years. 

“Going from someone that was very popular amongst the establishment at all these tournaments to suddenly being extremely unpopular was tough,” he said. “You're going to work and half the people that you see can't stand you, and half the people love you.”

Injuries also disrupted Pospisil's career several times. He hasn't played many matches in the past few years, especially at the ATP Tour level. He estimates he's spent 80 per cent of the last three years rehabbing injuries. Each attempted comeback seemed to hit a roadblock. Burnout set it. Finally, he knew it was time to call it a career officially in one final tournament in Toronto.

As for what's next, Pospisil says he'll pursue his interests in business. He's enjoyed helping raise money for a VC fund in the U.S. during recent years.

Pospisil doesn't see himself becoming a player coach, but he does plan to stay close to tennis. He's keen to help with any Davis Cup duties, should Tennis Canada ask him. He's also interested in aiding in-need tennis youngers in a philanthropic way.

“Nothing would make me happier than to help young juniors in less privileged positions,” he said. “I learned through years of trial and error, so if I can help expedite the learning curve for somebody who is a good person, or two or three or more players, then I would find that fulfilling.”

Pospisil's dad welcomes the post-retirement era.

“We're gonna miss seeing him competing in the big tournaments,” said his father. “But I'm also quite excited about seeing him go through his next chapter of life.”

The first half of the 2025 season gave Carlos Alcaraz five titles – in Rotterdam, Monte Carlo, Rome, Roland Garros and Queen's respectively – while he missed out on his third win in a row at the Wimbledon Championships due to a deluxe version of Jannik Sinner, who defeated him on the iconic Centre Court to become the first Italian ever to win the world's most famous tournament.

The 22-year-old Spaniard can be very satisfied with how he reacted to the difficulties of the beginning of the year, when he was unable to express his best tennis and had also had a small crisis after the shocking elimination against David Goffin in the second round of the Miami Open.

The five-time Grand Slam champion has made no secret of the fact that he will give his best in the second half of 2025 to return to the top of the ATP rankings, knowing that his top rival Sinner will have to defend many more points than him from Cincinnati onwards.

Both Carlos and Jannik will skip the Toronto Masters 1000 which begins next week and will return to action directly in Ohio, where Alcaraz's run in 2024 had already ended in the second round due to the fatigue accumulated at the Paris Olympics.

Like all the other top players, the champion from Murcia also took a little vacation after the Championships and recently returned to practice at the 'La Manga Club'.

The world number 2 knows that he has to change something from the past, as his level dropped significantly in the second half of the year in both 2023 and 2024. After winning his second Wimbledon title last season, Carlitos has not expressed his best level and has only triumphed at the Beijing ATP 500 by beating Sinner in an epic final.

It's no secret that the Spanish star's main goal is the US Open, which kicks off on August 24 in New York.

Brad Gilbert has rubbished reports that Jannik Sinner's coach Darren Cahill will not be working with the Italian at the 2025 US Open.

On Friday, Italian newspaper la Repubblica reported that Simone Vagnozzi would be Sinner's only coach at the New York Grand Slam as they claimed Cahill will take “a short break.”

Sinner has been coached by former Italian player Vagnozzi since February 2022, while Cahill joined the team in July 2022.

The coaching unit has been hugely successful, with Sinner winning four of the last seven Grand Slams and holding the world No 1 ranking since June 2024.

Gilbert, a former coach of Andre Agassi, Andy Roddick and Coco Gauff, works alongside Cahill as an analyst and commentator for ESPN.

In reply to a Twitter post sharing the claim that Cahill will miss the US Open, Gilbert made it clear that he expects the Australian to be at Flushing Meadows.

“For the record this is completely fake news,” wrote the former world No 4.

Cahill is a former ATP player and renowned coach who previously guided Andre Agassi, Lleyton Hewitt and Simona Halep to Grand Slam titles and world No 1.

Jannik Sinner claimed to have ‘wanted' controversial fitness trainer back despite doping row

The Australian was expected to leave Sinner's team at the end of the 2025 season after it was announced at the start of the year that he would be retiring from coaching on the tour.

However, Cahill has not fully closed the door on continuing his partnership with Sinner. Italian newspaper Il Corriere della Sera claimed after Sinner's Wimbledon triumph earlier this month that Cahill will remain on the Italian's team in 2026.

In his press conference following the Wimbledon final, Sinner revealed the decision on Cahill's future was in in his hands after winning a bet.

“It depends on whether I want to tell the truth or not,” Sinner said.

“We had a bet before the final. I told him, ‘If I win tomorrow, I can decide whether you stay until the end of the year or not.' Now the choice is mine!

“I've always looked for an honest person. Someone who gives me so much, not just on the tennis court, but in life outside of it, about how to live both in victories and disappointments. And he's very good. If I choose to stay with him, he probably won't travel so much anymore. That's normal.

“We'll have to see about that too. But I've always said, back in Australia, that I'd like to have him, because things are going well. Now we'll see.

“The season is still nothing, there are still so many tournaments to go, and I'll still see him a lot. You never know. But let's say I won the bet and now it's up to me to decide, we'll see.”

Asked this week by the ATP Tour whether Cahill will stay, Vagnozzi said: “Honestly, nothing's certain at the moment. But we'll all be happy if Darren stays.”

Karsten Braasch is one of tennis' most recognisable players

The German never made any huge inroads in the sport but his unorthodox serve, the goggles he wore on court and his tendency to smoke in changeovers made him an unforgettable figure. 

Braasch was a bit of a journeyman, a consistent tennis player on the ATP and ITF circuit with a career spanning between 1986 and 2001.

The now 58-year-old has a career-high ranking of No. 38 in the world but never made the second week of a Grand Slam or won a title.

Braasch's notoriety in the sport would end up coming not in an official match but during an exhibition.  

Serena and Venus Williams are widely considered as some of tennis' most successful ever players. 

Right from their debuts, the pair were seen as generational talents, a hype they lived up to with Serena ending her career with 23 Grand Slam titles and Venus with seven.

As a result of their dominance, many had raised the question as to whether they could compete with men. 

Venus, who recently secured a tour win aged 45, and Serena had also both claimed that they could likely beat any man ranked outside the top 200.

So in 1998, that opportunity came when the pair took part in a Battle of Sexes exhibition at the Australian Open.

Serena faced Braasch first, with the German ranked 203 in the world at the time.

He overcame Serena 6-1 in one set before beating Venus 6-2 in the second.

Braasch was 30 at the time and experienced pro while the Williams sisters were still teenagers.

Braasch had also made headlines as he played the two matches after finishing a round of golf and drinking two shandies.

There have been several Battles of the Sexes -- exhibition matches played between a man and a woman or a doubles match between two men and two women.

The most famous occurred in 1973 at the Houston Astrodome between 55-year-old Bobby Riggs and 29-year-old Billie Jean King.

King's 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 victory was viewed by an estimated 50 million people in the United States and 90 million worldwide, it further cemented King's status in the sport and helped her fight in the road to equality in tennis.

In October 2013, Novak Djokovic and Li Na played a light-hearted five game mini set in Bejjing, China to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the China Open.

Li was given a 30-0 advantage and along with Djokovic was not playing seriously.

The Serbian had even swapped places with ballboy at one point.

In the end, Li was victorious and went on to win the mini set 3-2.

At the Open de Tennis de Bourg-de-Péage in France in December 2023, the final of the women's draw was due to be played between Donna Vekic and Mirra Andreeva.

Vekic withdrew with injury and Ukrainian Marta Kostyuk agreed to replace her, but withdrew as a result of the backlash of facing a Russian.

So in an unusual turn of events, the tournament director asked Yanis Ghazouani Durand, who was ranked 1145 at the time, to play the 16-year-old.

Ghazouani won in straight sets but Andreeva took home the trophy as the winner of the women's draw.

Luciano Darderi maintained his perfect record in ATP Tour finals on Saturday at the Plava Laguna Croatia Open Umag, where he downed Carlos Taberner 6-3, 6-3 to win his second title in as many weeks.

The Italian triumphed at the ATP 250 in Bastad last week and backed that up in Umag, where he used his brutal baseline power to blast through the draw and become just the third man to win at least three tour-level titles this year, joining Carlos Alcaraz and Alexander Bublik, who also won his second consecutive trophy in Kitzbuehel on Saturday.

""It is something special for me,"" Darderi said. ""The last month has been crazy. I just want to thank my dad and my whole team. Without them it would be impossible. I am very happy about the title.

""It was two crazy weeks. If you told me this two weeks ago, I'd say it was impossible. But I am very happy with my performance and my tennis was incredible this week. I will try to rest now and continue to play like this in the next week on hard courts.""

In the final game of the match, Darderi seemed to roll his ankle when he brought up match point. Visibly limping, the Italian managed to seal victory in the following point before he collapsed to the court in the Umag rain.

Unable to walk properly, Taberner demonstrated great sportsmanship to help the second seed to his feet, with Darderi then receiving treatment on his ankle ahead of the trophy ceremony.



Darderi, a four-time tour-level champion, is up 11 spots to No. 35 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings following his run at the clay-court ATP 250. The 23-year-old began July at No. 59, but has climbed to within three spots of his career high No. 32 after winning nine consecutive matches across Bastad and Umag.

In the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting, rain fell for the majority of the 86-minute clash but it did not deter the second seed. Darderi struck 20 winners to 17 unforced errors and a forehand winner at 3-2 in the first set was enough to earn him the crucial break in the first set.

The Italian looked in control throughout the second set and is now 19-1 on clay in 2025 against players outside the Top 30, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

Taberner upset top seed Francisco Cerundolo en route to his maiden tour-level final. The Spaniard leaves Croatia up 27 spots at No. 84 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and is set to rise to a career high on Monday.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wtatennis.com","How the long game paid off for new doubles No. 1 Taylor Townsend","https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4324034/how-the-long-game-paid-off-for-new-doubles-no-1-taylor-townsend","Sat, 26 Jul 2025 01:57:58 GMT","

Thirteen years after her breakout as a junior champion, Taylor Townsend's path through criticism, setbacks, and reinvention has brought her to the top of the doubles rankings.

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Taylor Townsend was never given the luxury of a quiet rise. In 2012, at the age of 16, she was the junior world No. 1, an Australian Open champion and a Wimbledon doubles winner. But the praise quickly gave way to judgment.

She was the “it” girl of her tennis generation -- until she wasn't.

Townsend, who didn't have the lean, sculpted look of so many other elite junior players, was barred from competing in the junior US Open and sent to its training center in Florida to focus on improving her fitness. Eventually, her USTA funding and support was revoked.

What are professional athletes supposed to look like? Townsend was an early test case in the highly uncomfortable setting of harsh public scrutiny.

“I have had to go through some of the hardest struggles and the most personal struggles in the public eye,” she told reporters here at the Mubadala Citi DC Open. “Some really very kind of intimate topics that had to be a topic of conversation literally around the world as a child and having to defend myself as a kid.

“It's made me who I am, and it's made me appreciate every step of the way, and being able to have somebody say, externally, ‘You look so happy playing,' that's a win.”

There was cause for joy on Friday when, 13 years after she reigned as the top junior, Townsend captured the No. 1 PIF WTA Ranking in doubles.

“It is a dream,” Townsend said. “It's one of the goals that I set for myself when I actually began to think it was attainable.”

She and Zhang Shuai, playing together for the first time, advanced to the finals when the semifinal team of Emma Raducanu and Elena Rybakina -- ER Squared as they've become known -- retired after 25 minutes trailing 4-1. Both Raducanu and Rybakina are scheduled to play semifinal singles matches on Saturday.

The outcome ends Katerina Sinakova's 46-week reign at No. 1. She and Townsend have been playing together since 2024, when they won titles at Wimbledon and the year-end WTA Tour championships. Back in January, they won the Australian Open title and followed it up at the WTA 1000 in Dubai.

When Siniakova chose to play singles at the Prague Open, Townsend approached Zhang, and the two won their first two matches. The 325 points for reaching the final puts Townsend ahead of Siniakova, who dropped last year's 250 points that came from winning the Prague title with Barbora Krejcikova.

Townsend's singles run ended Friday with a 6-4, 7-6 (4) loss to Leylah Fernandez. But earlier in the tournament, after beating No. 6 seed Sofia Kenin, Townsend presided over a sprawling, illuminating press conference.

“There hasn't been anyone who has gone through what I went through since I went through it, so I think things have changed a little bit -- which is great, right?” Townsend said. “When I was going through the whole body image thing, there was no body positivity movement. That didn't exist.

“It was common to scrutinize body types and give a person a body archetype and what you should be and having to put people in this box. And now, throughout the years, it has evolved into shattering those boxes and basically people being able to accomplish whatever they want in their fields, however you look and whatever.”

Previously a two-time Washington quarterfinalist, Emma Raducanu is into her first Mubadala Citi DC Open semifinal after a straight-sets win over Maria Sakkari.

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Nearly four years after being defined by a single fortnight, Emma Raducanu is taking the long view.

She won the 2021 US Open as a teenage qualifier and what followed were a string of injuries, surgeries and an inescapable cloud of bad karma. Now she's trusting the process, taking satisfaction from a practice set well played or a successful gym session. At 22, she's becoming a more professional tennis player.

Washington, D.C.: Draws | Scores | Order of Play

“I think when I watch myself now, I really like how I look on the court -- not in like a narcissistic way,” Raducanu said Thursday, drawing laughter from reporters. “I mean in terms of energy, and I think I feel quite upbeat.

“I think it's more I look composed on the court. I think that's a product of just the amount of work I'm doing behind the scenes that maybe people don't see. I know regardless of the result I'm doing the right things, and I'm banking so many good days in a row. It takes a bit of pressure off the immediate result in the matches.”

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

Perhaps as a result, the results here at the Mubadala Citi DC Open have been stellar. On Friday, Raducanu was a quarterfinal winner, defeating Maria Sakkari 6-4, 7-5. To do it, she won the last five games in a draining match that required 2 hours and 10 minutes.

“I think you get to a point where you're so tired that you don't really know what you're doing anymore, and I think maybe that helped,” Raducanu said afterwards, recalling her run of games won at the end of the match. “I just really had to be smooth and conserve energy.

“I was also thinking if this goes to three sets, I don't know how I'm going to do it. So just happy I toughed it out.”

In her third appearance in the nation's capital, Raducanu took one step further than she did in 2022 and 2024. Her quarterfinal record improves to 3-9 and her career mark against Sakkari climbs to 4-0.

It's Raducanu's first WTA Tour-level semifinal in more than a year and her first on hardcourts in three years.

On the tournament's hottest day so far -- the temperature hovered in the middle 90s but it felt close to 100 -- it was Sakkari who got out of the blocks the fastest. Thanks to two double faults by Raducanu, she forged to a 2-0 lead.

Raducanu won the next three games, and they were level at 4-4 when Raducanu scored the decisive break with a deft, sharply angled backhand return. She served it out, converting her second set point.

Sakkari took control of the second set and was leading when Raducanu re-asserted herself. After holding serve, she broke Sakkari to get back on serve, converting her fourth opportunity with another sweet backhand return winner. After a brief visit from the trainers, Raducanu broke Sakkari. Two errant forehands were the culprit before Raducanu served it out.

With the WTA Heat Rule in effect, there likely would have been a 10-minute break if Sakkari had won the second set.

“It was one of the toughest matches conditions-wise I have ever played in,” Raducanu said afterward. “Those points in the second set, I was getting a bit wobbly. I think the humidity here, it just makes it feel completely like you have just opened an oven and it just stayed open and your head is in there.”

Meanwhile, it was still a nice tournament for the No. 90-ranked Sakkari, who was celebrating her 30th birthday today. The former World No. 3 defeated Katie Boulter and No. 2 seed Emma Navarro to reach this stage.

Kalinskaya awaits: In Saturday's semifinals, Raducanu will play Anna Kalinskaya in their first career meeting. World No. 48 Kalinskaya upset No. 4 seed Clara Tauson 6-3, 7-5 in Friday's late quarterfinal.

Tauson defeated Kalinskaya at Wimbledon earlier this month, but Kalinskaya got revenge on Friday, at one of her best-performing stops on tour. Former Top 15 player Kalinskaya also made the 2019 semifinals in Washington, as well as the quarterfinals in 2022.

ONBOARD: Lando Norris' 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the Belgian Grand Prix 

'I drove a tiny bit better' - Polesitter Norris on the small margins that made the difference in Spa Qualifying

Max Verstappen has emerged victorious in the Sprint at the Belgian Grand Prix.

Max Verstappen has clinched his first Sprint win of the season at the Belgian Grand Prix weekend, the Red Bull driver holding on for victory after making an impressive overtake on Oscar Piastri during the opening lap of action.

While Piastri initially made a solid launch to hold onto P1 off the line, Verstappen surged ahead later in the lap to take the lead. But as the Sprint entered into its second half, the Dutchman faced increasing pressure from both Piastri and the other McLaren of Lando Norris.

Despite Piastri's best efforts, Verstappen continued to defend his position and sealed a dominant win, with Piastri and Norris ultimately having to settle for second and third respectively.

Charles Leclerc followed in fourth for Ferrari, despite briefly running ahead of Norris in the early stages, while Haas' Esteban Ocon, Williams' Carlos Sainz, the other Haas of Ollie Bearman and Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar followed in fifth through to eighth.

After just one practice session on Friday, Sprint Qualifying had decided the grid for the third 100km dash of the season, a format that awards points to the top eight finishers from a maximum of eight for P1 down to one for P8.

FORMULA 1 MOËT & CHANDON BELGIAN GRAND PRIX 2025

Piastri stormed to his first Sprint pole of the campaign by setting an impressive lap of 1m 40.510s, putting him over four-tenths clear of Verstappen in second while the other McLaren of Norris had to settle for third.

Meanwhile there were some surprises further down the order; Hamilton was the shock exit from SQ1 in P18 while both Mercedes cars missed out on the top-10 shootout, with Antonelli eliminated early in P20 and Russell ending the session in P13.

Ahead of the Sprint getting underway, one change was confirmed to the grid as Franco Colapinto – who had ended Sprint Qualifying in P19 – would start from the pit lane due to Alpine changing the rear wing of his A525 under parc ferme conditions.

There was further trouble for the Enstone-based squad when Pierre Gasly's car was pulled off the grid in the build-up to the Sprint, with the Alpine crew rolling the vehicle back through the pit lane and to the garage due to a water system issue.

When the tyre blankets came off prior to the formation lap, it was revealed that the whole field would be starting on the medium compound with the exception of Colapinto, staring on the soft tyres from the pit lane. Meanwhile it was soon confirmed that Gasly would not be taking the start, with the team unable to fix the issue on his car in time.

As the lights went out, Piastri made a strong start to lead away from pole position – but Verstappen was not ready to give up, the Dutchman making a stunning overtake by getting in Piastri's slipstream down the Kemmel straight to surge into P1.

Meanwhile the other McLaren of Norris also lost a position, with Leclerc taking P3 from the Briton just behind the leaders. Behind them, Ocon had held onto P5 ahead of Sainz in P6, Bearman in P7 and Hadjar in P8, the Frenchman gaining a place following the exit of his countryman.

Piastri remained on the tail of Verstappen, with the gap standing at around half a second as Lap 4 ticked down, yet the Australian could not quite close in. Elsewhere, Norris retook third place from Leclerc, whilst Alpine confirmed that Gasly had joined the Sprint two laps down, the team seemingly using the event as a test session.

Further back, Antonelli made a move on Nico Hulkenberg to grab 17th place, the Italian looking to make up for his disappointing Sprint Qualifying. Piastri, meanwhile, looked to have kicked up a little gravel as he pushed hard in his pursuit of Verstappen.

“I've got no rear already,” Hamilton was heard radioing in on Lap 7, the Ferrari driver running in P14 following his off in Sprint Qualifying on Saturday. At the front, Norris looked to be catching the leading pair of Verstappen and Piastri – would a three-car fight for the lead play out?

Antonelli was chasing Hamilton by Lap 9, the rookie looking to put pressure on the driver he replaced at Mercedes. Up ahead, Norris was now just six-tenths behind Piastri, with the Australian the same margin behind Verstappen.

Piastri looked to find a way around the outside of the Red Bull on Lap 11, but the World Champion managed to defend. “I can't brake,” Verstappen reported, having had a slight moment at the last chicane.

None of the trio were ready to give up as the Sprint entered into its final laps, with Norris told that Piastri's battery was at “mid-level” as the Briton remained on the tail of his team mate. Further back, Alex Albon was also in fighting mode as he engaged in a close scrap with Fernando Alonso for P14.

Despite his efforts, Piastri could not close the gap further to Verstappen and the Dutch driver crossed the line to seal a dominant Sprint victory, the Red Bull man taking the chequered flag by 0.753s from his closest rival.

Norris was a further six-tenths back from Piastri in third place, ahead of Leclerc, Ocon, Sainz, Bearman and Hadjar in the remaining points-paying positions of fourth to eighth respectively.

Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto and Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson completed the top 10 order, with Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda and the Mercedes of Russell just missing out in 11th and 12th.

The Aston Martin pair of Lance Stroll and Alonso were P13 and P14, while Hamilton ended a difficult Sprint event in P15.

Albon had to settle for 16th, followed by Antonelli, Hulkenberg and Colapinto in the final positions ahead of Gasly, who was classified as retired after his brief return to action.

""It worked out really well,"" said Verstappen. ""That is the only real opportunity that you're going to get against them, and we got it into Turn 5. I knew it was going to be very tough keeping them behind, so it was very much like cat and mouse with DRS, battery usage, and the whole race was within seven tenths. I couldn't afford to make big mistakes. I had one tiny hiccup into the last corner, but apart from that, it was a great result to keep them behind. To have a win here at Spa, for me, it's a Sprint win, but it still counts and I'm very happy with what we did out there.”

Following the Sprint, the drivers will next return to action during Qualifying for the Grand Prix later on Saturday, with the session set to begin at 1600 local time. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can follow the action.

ONBOARD: Lando Norris' 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the Belgian Grand Prix 

'I drove a tiny bit better' - Polesitter Norris on the small margins that made the difference in Spa Qualifying

Lando Norris secured pole position for the Belgian Grand Prix in an exciting Qualifying session from Spa-Francorchamps.

Lando Norris will start the Belgian Grand Prix from pole position after going fastest of all in Qualifying, the McLaren driver beating team mate Oscar Piastri and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc with an impressive lap around Spa-Francorchamps.

After setting the pace in Q1, Norris was bettered by Piastri in the Q2 segment – but the Briton was quick to lay a marker in Q3, grabbing provisional pole during the first runs with an effort of 1m 40.562s.

That time proved unbeatable as the final laps played out, with Piastri ending up in second place just 0.085s away from the other papaya car. Leclerc, meanwhile, improved to put himself into P3 ahead of the Red Bull of Max Verstappen in fourth.

Alex Albon was an impressive fifth for Williams, slotting in just ahead of Mercedes' George Russell in sixth. Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda followed in seventh, while the Racing Bulls pair of Isack Hadjar and Liam Lawson took eighth and ninth respectively and Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto completed the top 10.

Qualifying results

FORMULA 1 MOËT & CHANDON BELGIAN GRAND PRIX 2025

Despite a strong Sprint performance earlier in the day, the Haas duo of Esteban Ocon and Ollie Bearman were not so lucky in Qualifying, having both exited Q2 in 11th and 12th places ahead of Alpine's Pierre Gasly in 13th.

Off the back of his podium result last time out at Silverstone, Nico Hulkenberg qualified down in 14th for Kick Sauber, while Carlos Sainz wound up in 15th for Williams.

There was early drama in Q1 when an at-risk Lewis Hamilton looked to have done enough to get himself out of danger – only for his lap time to be deleted owing to track limits, which dropped the Ferrari driver down to P16 and out of the session.

Alpine's Franco Colapinto was just behind in P17, while Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli had a disappointing outing down in P18. It was also a tough Qualifying for Aston Martin, with Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll bringing up the rear in P19 and P20 respectively.

More to follow

A few hours on from the third Sprint of the season, the drivers and teams switched their attentions to Qualifying in order to decide the starting order for Sunday's Belgian Grand Prix.

There was early drama prior to Q1 getting underway, with Alonso reporting that he “nearly crashed” with Bearman after the Haas moved into the pit lane queue ahead of him, while Hulkenberg ended up with a damaged front wing following contact with the Aston Martin of Stroll, an incident that will be investigated after the session for an unsafe release.

The whole field had bolted on the soft tyres for the opening runs of the 18-minute segment, with the exception of Colapinto on the mediums, and once every driver had put a lap on the board it was Leclerc on top of the timesheets with his effort of 1m 41.635s.

His time was then bettered by Norris, who went faster by 0.625s – while Piastri then slotted into second, but still just under two-tenths adrift of his team mate.

At the other end of the spectrum, the drivers at risk in the danger zone were Colapinto, Russell, Stroll, Antonelli and Bortoleto, with Alonso on the bubble in P15.

As the clock ticked down for the final minutes of Q1, the track became busy as everybody tried to get themselves into the top-10 shootout. Both Mercedes cars improved, with Antonelli slotting into 11th while Russell moved up to eighth.

But there was trouble for Antonelli as the better efforts of others pushed the Italian down the order, moving him down to P18 and out of the session. Also exiting were the Aston Martin duo of Alonso and Stroll, who ended up at the rear of the field in P19 and P20.

Meanwhile all eyes were on Hamilton as the seven-time World Champion found himself at risk. The Briton initially did enough to haul himself up to P7 – but a shock twist saw his lap deleted for exceeding track limits, leaving him down in P16, one spot ahead of Colapinto

Knocked out: Hamilton, Colapinto, Antonelli, Alonso, Stroll

The session continued at pace with Q2, Verstappen leading the pack out as the next segment got underway. Once again, the soft tyre was the preferred option for the remaining 15 drivers as they battled to progress to Q1.

Piastri set the benchmark as the first laps came in, the Australian pumping in a 1m 40.626s to go just 0.089s clear of Norris, while Verstappen was some three-tenths off in third. Further back, Bearman had a moment after a big snap through Pouhon, forcing the Haas driver to abort his lap.

With the opening efforts in, the names at risk were Hulkenberg, Bortoleto, Gasly, Sainz and Bearman – and, following a brief lull in the action, a queue of cars peeled out of the pit lane for their final runs of Q2, prompting a seemingly annoyed Piastri to comment: “Some people need bigger mirrors.”

While Verstappen opted to remain in the pits, the rest of the field were trying to better their times. Gasly moved up to ninth, while Bortoleto went into an eye-catching eighth before an improvement from Lawson then put the Racing Bulls driver into that slot.

The Haas pair – who enjoyed a strong Sprint earlier in the day – both missed the cut when trying to improve, leaving Ocon in P11 and Bearman in P12. Meanwhile Gasly was pushed down to 13th place, and a tough Qualifying left Hulkenberg down in 14th ahead of the Williams of Sainz in 15th.

Knocked out: Ocon, Bearman, Gasly, Hulkenberg, Sainz

The track came alive again as the all-important top-10 shootout began – but who would seal pole position at Spa-Francorchamps?

As the first laps went on the board, Piastri initially looked to have taken provisional pole ahead of Verstappen – only for Norris to storm through on an even quicker time, the Briton beating his team mate by 0.189s via his effort of 1m 40.562s.

Verstappen – some half a second back in third – reported that he “just didn't have the same grip” in the Red Bull, while Leclerc had taken fourth ahead of Russell, Tsunoda, Lawson, Albon, Hadjar and Bortoleto.

With the clock ticking down, all 10 cars headed out for their final grid-deciding runs. Verstappen improved his effort but remained in third place, while Norris also did not better his previous lap. Leclerc moved up to third, pushing Verstappen down a place – but the question remained over whether Piastri could steal pole from Norris.

It turned out that the Australian could not, with his improved lap ultimately not enough to beat Norris' previous time, meaning that the Briton would start from pole position. Elsewhere, Albon was a notable improvement in fifth, putting him ahead of Russell in sixth.

Tsunoda secured his best grid slot as a Red Bull driver in seventh, while the Racing Bulls of Hadjar and Lawson took eighth and ninth, with Bortoleto rounding out the top 10 for Kick Sauber.

""It was a decent lap,"" said Norris. ""I'm happy. I don't know why everyone was pretty worried after yesterday. I wasn't even that far off. It was just a couple of little issues that we had. I was confident after yesterday and coming into today, so it's nice to see that I could get back to the top.”

The 2025 Belgian Grand Prix is set to begin at 1500 local time on Sunday. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can catch the action from Spa-Francorchamps.

'I drove a tiny bit better' - Polesitter Norris on the small margins that made the difference in Spa Qualifying

Lando Norris was pleased to bounce back with pole position at the Belgian Grand Prix, while McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri had to settle for second place.

Lando Norris was pleased to “get back to the top” by claiming pole position in Qualifying for the Belgian Grand Prix, while McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri was left disappointed to miss out on P1, having felt that there “was more in it”.

With Norris going quickest in Q1 and Piastri setting the pace in Q2, it was Norris who went quickest during the opening laps of Q3 on a lap of 1m 40.562s – a time that remained fastest across the final runs.

While the Briton was “not the happiest” with his third place in Friday's Sprint Qualifying, he insisted that he had never been concerned about the remainder of the weekend after reflecting on his result in Saturday's Qualifying session.

“It was a decent lap,” said Norris. “I'm happy. I don't know why everyone was pretty worried after yesterday. I wasn't even that far off. It was just a couple of little issues that we had.

“I was confident after yesterday and coming into today, so it's nice to see that I could get back to the top.”

Pushed on where the improvement had come from, the 25-year-old responded: “Three-tenths is just slipstream and not being first out of the pit lane. It's nothing to worry about. People like to make a lot of things up, but I've felt good. The car has been flying all weekend.

“Oscar has been doing a good job all weekend, so we're pushing each other a lot, like he said. It's tough, because you see where your strengths and weaknesses are easily and you learn from each other quickly, so it's a good but tough battle that we have at the minute.”

While the track action during Friday and Saturday has taken place in dry conditions, the possibility of rain remains for Sunday. Norris, however, is hoping that the weather will stay as it has been for race day.

“I'd prefer it to stay dry, honestly, even for the fans,” the eight-time race winner reflected. “It's rained here for the last 10 years or so, so it would be nice to have a dry Sunday. But I don't mind whether it's dry or rain or somewhere in the middle. It's normal here and I look forward to a fun race.”

On the other side of the McLaren garage, Piastri improved on his final effort but was unable to better Norris' lap, the Australian ending Qualifying 0.085s adrift.

When quizzed afterwards if he was content or disappointed with his P2 result, Piastri answered: “[It's] a bit disappointing. The second lap was coming together really well and I just made a little mistake into [Turn] 14 and lost a lot of time so, yeah, I'm disappointed.

“It felt like the car was good again and it's fine margins out there. Obviously it's not a bad place to be starting, but I think there was more in it, which is always disappointing.”

In terms of whether he had been left surprised by Norris' improvement over the weekend – or if he felt that the Briton was learning from his own data – Piastri reflected: “I don't know. I think we're a good team mate pairing and we learn a lot from each other every weekend.

“That's what makes us such a good team, but it also makes it difficult when you're trying to fight each other. I did an okay job today, just didn't quite execute when it mattered, and it's a bit of a shame.”

Following his second place result in the Sprint – after starting from pole position before losing out to Max Verstappen on the first lap – Piastri joked: “After the Sprint, I was aiming for P2!

“I don't know what the weather is going to hold tomorrow, I think it's going to be quite different. We'll wait and see what we get but try and have a good race.”

'I drove a tiny bit better' - Polesitter Norris on the small margins that made the difference in Spa Qualifying

Watch the highlights as Oscar Piastri topped Sprint Qualifying at the Belgian Grand Prix weekend in Spa.

Oscar Piastri blew the field away with a stunning effort to take Sprint pole position by 0.477s from Max Verstappen in Belgium.

The championship leader survived a scare in SQ2 when his initial effort was deleted for a track limits violation, but bounced back to set a 1m 40.510s in the final phase. McLaren had dominated the early stages of the weekend, but Verstappen denied the team a front-row lockout, putting his Red Bull second, and relegating Lando Norris to third.

The Sprint will see George Russell, Lewis Hamilton and Kimi Antonelli facing uphill battles, as the trio all failed to make SQ3. They were clasified 13th, 18th, and 20th respectively.

'I drove a tiny bit better' - Polesitter Norris on the small margins that made the difference in Spa Qualifying

Oscar Piastri was delighted to secure pole position in Sprint Qualifying at the Belgian Grand Prix, while McLaren team mate Lando Norris ended the session in third.

Oscar Piastri was delighted to “get a result” after taking pole position in Sprint Qualifying at the Belgian Grand Prix, while McLaren team mate Lando Norris admitted that he was “not the happiest” following his P3 finish.

Having been disappointed by his race last time out at Silverstone – in which he received a 10-second time penalty – Piastri looked determined to make up for that as the weekend got underway at Spa-Francorchamps, bouncing back from a deleted lap time in SQ2 to go fastest in SQ3 on a time of 1m 40.510s.

Reflecting on his session after jumping out of the car, the Australian was all smiles as he said: “It was a good lap. A little scare in SQ2 with the lap deletion, but the car's been mega all day and I feel like I've been able to put in a lot of good laps.

“Thanks to the team, the car's been great and this is a track I love. It's my favourite one of the year and, I don't know, maybe that gave me a couple of extra tenths! It's always good fun around here, when the car's handling as well as it is today it's a pleasure.”

Quizzed on why he had appeared so confident throughout the day at Spa, Piastri responded: “I don't know. The car has been in a good window from Lap 1, and again it's a track I always enjoy coming to and, yeah, I don't know why.

“I think [I] had good confidence, I feel like the last few weekends have been good from a pace perspective but not so much from a results perspective, so it's nice to get a result today.”

Looking ahead to how he might fare in Saturday's Sprint, Piastri admitted that there are still some unknowns but sounded an optimistic note.

“I need to go and look,” the 24-year-old said. “The Red Bulls were very quick in a straight line, in practice – I don't know if it was the same in Sprint Qualifying, but that makes life difficult and Spa is probably the worst track to have pole position at!

“Let's see and I'll go have a look, but the pace in the car is really strong. I've felt good today so hopefully we can have a good race tomorrow.”

Norris, meanwhile, had displayed good pace during the session but ultimately crossed the line in third, with the Red Bull of Max Verstappen sandwiched between the two McLaren cars.

Pushed on how he assessed his final run in Sprint Qualifying, the Briton explained: “Not quick enough, I guess, is the only thing. It wasn't the cleanest of laps but still quite a big gap to the top. Not too disappointed, it's third, it's for the Sprint so not the biggest worry but, yeah, some things to work on.”

When asked if he had taken too much life out of his tyres, Norris answered: “It's impossible to say, maybe it made my tyres better. You don't know those things, but we'll look at it overnight.”

Despite missing out on pole for the Sprint, the 25-year-old suggested that he was not too worried about how his session went.

“It's just Friday so I'm not too fussed,” said Norris. “Not the happiest of course, I would like to be a bit quicker than I was today. But it's the way it is and I just have to do some more work tonight.”

'I drove a tiny bit better' - Polesitter Norris on the small margins that made the difference in Spa Qualifying

On his first race weekend since his promotion to the role of Team Principal at Racing Bulls, Alan Permane has been reflecting on his new position.

Two years ago in the Spa paddock for the Belgium Grand Prix, it was announced Alan Permane would bring an end to an extraordinary 34-year stint at the Enstone team, now known as Alpine, after being let go.

It was a tough moment for Permane, who had been in charge of the trackside team. Few knew the squad better than him. He was told the Tuesday before that Spa would be his last weekend and having spent almost all of his working life with the squad, which ran as Benetton, Renault and Lotus, and for the first time in more than three decades, his future was uncertain.

But then the phone rang. It was Laurent Mekies, who Permane had got to know over the years – particularly when they were both sporting directors of Renault and Ferrari respectively. Mekies was charged with rebuilding Racing Bulls – and he wanted Permane to join in the more senior role of Racing Director.

Permane accepted, kicking off ahead of last season, and he looked reborn. Eighteen months after that, he got another phone call ahead of the Belgian Grand Prix – it was a significantly better one than that from Alpine's boss.

This time, it was the Red Bull senior management on the line and they wanted to know if he fancied stepping up into the big job to replace Red Bull-bound Mekies.

""I was told the week after Silverstone what was happening,"" says Permane, when we chat on the the sofas in the ski chalet-inspired Red Bull Energy Station. ""First of all, was it something I'd considered? No?

""It's not something that's ever been on my radar, but would I help the team out and step into this role and of course when Red Bull come knocking you can't say no, and it's a fantastic opportunity of course for me.

""It's quite a change. I'm a trackside guy, I've spent my life at the track. There you manage teams of 60 to 100 people, and now it's another step so there's that to take into consideration but [I'm] very much looking forward to it."" 

Mekies is believed to have campaigned for Permane to take the role following his own promotion. The two have become friends as well as colleagues and he will remain a close ally given the two teams are under the same umbrella.

""He's very kind,"" adds Permane. ""He's been great to me. He said just be yourself and you'll be fine so I'll keep that in the back of my head. He's been super helpful.""

There was widespread support for Permane's new job within the paddock, the 58-year-old having become a highly-respected member of the F1 world.

When he was let go by Alpine last year, Mercedes boss Toto Wolff described Permane as ""one of the rocks of F1"" and ""certainly someone with a lot of knowledge"".

Then Red Bull boss Christian Horner added: ""He's very much been a constant there during that period. I think that earns respect and recognition.""

It's no surprise then that the reaction to his new role has been positive. ""It's been lovely, honestly I've been very humbled by the reaction,"" Permane says.

""One of the very first messages that I had was from [Alpine executive adviser] Flavio Briatore, that made me so proud.

""He left me a voice note saying he was 'so happy for you', that was lovely. My phone blew up on that Wednesday and I'm very lucky to have that sort of support.""

It's the biggest job he's ever had – but not one that seems to be fazing him.

""The differences will be as I say managing people who are not track people, that's something that will be new to me,"" he adds.

""I have done that in the past where various technical departments in Enstone sat under me but it's all been track focused as well, it's all been delivering or building stuff for the track. This will be a far broader role and this will be something I need to do, but I'm very ready for that.""

He added: ""It's a management role, it's a people role. I always remember my first day as a race engineer, I remember Pat Symonds giving me the clipboard and saying you're running the car today sort of thing at a test and I say to people now, one of the things they don't tell you about being a race engineer is you suddenly become a manager.

""You've suddenly got 10 people when the car comes in looking at you for what do we do next. You very quickly learn management skills from those days.""

Racing Bulls have emerged as a strong midfield force, scoring points in six of 12 races so far this year, which puts them seventh in the Teams' Championship on 36 points.

Kick Sauber are just five points up the road – with Williams 18 further up. P5, the long-held but never achieved target of the team's former long-time boss Franz Tost, is very much in play.

So, what have the board set Permane as his immediate targets?

""The goals are clear,"" he says. ""The goals are to keep doing what we've been doing, keep the good work that Laurent and Peter [Bayer] have started and just keep that trajectory.

""Go racing with a smile on our faces, go racing with a good spirit and of course success on track is a very important part of what we do. Certainly we've improved this year compared with last year and we'll be looking to keep that trajectory going.""

And what about his personal goals?

""I don't want to set targets and say we need to have a podium or need to score this many points or need to finish in this position in the championship,"" he says.

""I just want to make sure we're getting the best out of the cars, the designers and the production team have given us to race and if we can do that, then we'll have a good last half of the season.""

'I drove a tiny bit better' - Polesitter Norris on the small margins that made the difference in Spa Qualifying

Lewis Hamilton described his Belgian Grand Prix Qualifying result as ""unacceptable"" after finishing 16th while Ferrari team mate Charles Leclerc in third.

Lewis Hamilton conceded his early qualifying exits at the Belgian Grand Prix are ""unacceptable"" as he insisted he would apologise to his Ferrari team.

The seven-time Formula 1 champion will start Sunday's Grand Prix from 16th on the grid after a track limits violation on his final Q1 run resulted in his time being deleted, seeing him eliminated at the first hurdle. This came after a similarly disappointing Sprint Qualifying, where he had managed only the 18th fastest time to exit in SQ1.

In that Friday session, he had locked his rear tyres and spun – an error Hamilton described as a career first and later said was affected by a new component on his Ferrari.

Following his latest Qualifying disappointment on Saturday, when asked if he was beginning to feel more comfortable with the changes, Hamilton told Sky Sports F1: “Not particularly. I was the same as I was for the rest of the weekend. We made some changes, the car didn't feel terrible. I think it was even tougher for us. We had to put a second set [of soft tyres] on just to get through Q1.

“Then from my side, another mistake, so I've really got to look internally. I've got to apologise to my team, because that's just unacceptable to be out in both Q1s. It's a very, very poor performance from myself.”

Compounding Hamilton's difficulties is the impressive weekend being enjoyed by team mate Charles Leclerc, who qualified fourth for the Sprint, and third for the Grand Prix.

He added: “It's incredibly painful. It's turning out to be a pretty bad weekend so far.”

With rain expected to fall on Sunday, there is at least a chance for a clever strategy to change a driver's fortune, something highlighted by Nico Hulkenberg at Silverstone last time out as the Sauber driver claimed a stunning podium.

But even this prospect did little to lift Hamilton's spirits. He said: “Anything can happen here. I don't know. I have no clue about tomorrow. It's going to be very hard from where I am, so definitely a weekend to forget.”

Looking to what the remainder of the season could bring, Hamilton conceded: “I mean, we're trying to do the best with what we have, and then everyone is working flat out back at the factory.

""We have had upgrades, but I think that's probably it for the year, and the focus is now on next year's car. This season has been a tricky one.”

'I drove a tiny bit better' - Polesitter Norris on the small margins that made the difference in Spa Qualifying

A pair of errors saw Lewis Hamilton drop out of Sprint Qualifying in the first phase of the Friday session at the Belgian Grand Prix weekend.

Lewis Hamilton was left visibly frustrated after qualifying in 18th place for Saturday's Sprint in Belgium following a session-ending spin.

While Ferrari brought a significant upgrade package to Spa-Francorchamps, seven-time champion Hamilton was unable to feel the benefits on Friday, shaking his head when asked if the new suspension had made the SF-25 more drivable.

An error on his opening lap of SQ1 had left the Briton with work to do on his final effort, but a spin at the final chicane as the chequered flag fell sealed his position on the penultimate row.

Asked what had happened in the session, Hamilton said simply: “I spun.”

Pressed on whether rear locking had caused the incident, he added: “Yeah. The first time in my career.”

Attempting to find some form of positivity, Hamilton reflected: “Tomorrow's a new day. Obviously, I'm massively frustrated. A lot of work has gone in and to be there is not great. Hopefully, tomorrow is going to be better.”

On the other side of the garage, Charles Leclerc positioned his Ferrari on the second row of the grid, although the 0.768s margin to pole left him with conflicting emotions.

“The feeling was pretty good which, to me, it's a mixed feeling,” said Leclerc. “On one side, I'm happy that the car feels better and, on the other, even if the car feels pretty good, we are still seven tenths off, which is a huge amount of time.

“Yes, it's a long track, but it's still a big amount of time. So there is a lot of work to be done.

""We just need to add grip to this car at the end of the day. I don't think we do anything particularly wrong, but we just need more grip that we don't seem to have for now.”

'I drove a tiny bit better' - Polesitter Norris on the small margins that made the difference in Spa Qualifying

Max Verstappen, Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris report back after the Sprint at Spa-Francorchamps.

DRIVERS

1 – Max VERSTAPPEN (Red Bull Racing), 2 – Oscar PIASTRI (McLaren), 3 – Lando NORRIS (McLaren)

TRACK INTERVIEWS
(Conducted by Jolyon Palmer)

Q: Lando, you're back to the top three at the end of that one. You had to work for it at the start with Charles Leclerc. Obviously, the start and the first run up towards Les Combes is tricky. The Ferrari came past but you dealt with him quickly.

Lando NORRIS: Yeah. I mean, not a lot going on. Obviously, a bit of fun at the start with trying to overtake Charles. Maybe could have positioned myself a little bit better but otherwise a bit too difficult to get past Max. Max drove a good race and I wasn't going to get past anyone unless Oscar got past Max. They drove good races. Not a lot we could do on a day like today, so looking forward to tomorrow.

Q: So, what are you thinking then when you're stuck in there? You could obviously see the top two very close together. Are you hoping that there's a bit of action ahead? Are you hoping that Oscar makes a mistake to fall towards you?

LN: Yeah. It's tough. Obviously, I hope for a bit of battling or something but the Red Bull was just too quick on the straight for us to catch up. Maybe some tweaks for us to make into qualifying, I don't know. We'll reassess and see what we can do.

Q: And it wasn't the easiest day for you yesterday, but only one point lost to Oscar in terms of the championship, and you can regroup now ahead of the Grand Prix. You're off the back of two Grand Prix wins in a row. Can you make it three?

LN: This is the plan. I'm not too fussed about Sprint races, but obviously main races I prefer to win. We'll see. I wasn't too bad yesterday. I was comfortable, just a couple things didn't go my way. But I'm confident we can have a good result later and put in some good quality laps.

Q: Well done, Lando. Six more points in the bag.

LN: Thank you.

Q: Oscar, second place. We knew the start was going to be tricky for you on pole position. That Red Bull is very slippery. I guess it played out kind of how you expected it on the first lap.

Oscar PIASTRI: Pretty much, yeah. I tried my best to snake my way through the straights and not give too much of a tow but I just didn't have enough straight-line speed and then obviously didn't have enough straight-line speed for the next 15 laps either. Still a good result, still good points. It is only the Sprint, the main points are tomorrow. Pretty happy with it but just a bit frustrating that I couldn't get past.

Q: I imagine you know the back of the Red Bull pretty well by now, having followed so close for so long, but the opportunity didn't quite come to you in that one. What do you do with the car then? Do you trim out some downforce? Are you looking at the weather? How can you stop this happening tomorrow?

OP: It's a great question. The weather is looking pretty bad for tomorrow, which obviously means you probably don't want to take off too much wing, but I don't really want to repeat the Sprint we've just had. We'll have a look, see what we can do. There's a lot of things to look into before tomorrow.

Q: Well, you've still been on fire this weekend, the man to beat on one lap so far. We've got that coming up later. Going to go and give it the beans again on Soft tyres only?

OP: Yeah. I'm looking forward to it. Spa is my favourite track of the year and especially in qualifying it's just mega around here. Looking forward to some more laps this afternoon.

Q: We're looking forward to them too. Well done, Oscar.

OP: Thanks.

Q: Max, a Sprint win, a Spa special for you as well there getting the run on the first lap. I guess you knew that was your big chance with the Red Bull pace you've got on the straight line and you executed it to perfection.

Max VERSTAPPEN: Yeah. It worked out really well. That's the only real opportunity you're going to get against them and we got it into Turn 5. Then I knew it was going to be very tough to keep them behind. It was just playing cat and mouse, DRS, battery usage. The whole race was within seven tenths. I couldn't really afford to make big mistakes. I had one tiny lock-up in the last corner but apart from that it was a great result to keep them behind and to have a win here in Spa. Of course it's a Sprint win but it still counts and I'm very happy with what we did out there.

Q: It was a great performance. Lots of eyes in the mirrors. I want to talk to you about the brakes though because you mentioned at one point it was difficult to hit the peak pressure. We saw you as you referenced have a little run-on in the Bus Stop. What was going on there?

MV: Basically, you're keeping faster cars behind so you have to drive over the limit of what you think is possible. Tyre management is out of the window so that is what makes it really difficult. I'm just doing 15 qualifying laps to try and keep them behind on a track where tyre management is important. It wasn't easy but we managed to do it so I'm very happy with that.

Q: Still a lot going on in a race where there's no position change after the first lap but you're having to work that hard. So what about qualifying later on? The McLaren looks a little bit too quick but can you make some changes and get to pole?

MV: Do I feel pole is possible? I'm not sure but we'll try our best, try and set up the car how we want. After this race we'll have a few more ideas of what we want to do and then try to be as close as possible to them.

PRESS CONFERENCE

Q: Very well done, Max. A perfectly executed sprint by you, a game of cat and mouse throughout. Just how much satisfaction does a win like that give you?

MV: Yeah, I'm just happy that I was able to hang on to it. I knew, of course, in the start there were possibilities up to Turn 5. We took it. And then, from there onwards, I knew also they had new Mediums. I knew that it was going to be even more difficult. Just trying to hang in there with the top speed that we had. I knew the middle sector was going to be the weaker area for us and just trying not to make any mistakes there, basically. And it worked very well. The only thing that I had was one time the braking into the last chicane. But it's also, you know, you're driving a bit over your own kind of management, so it's easy to just overheat the tyres a bit too much. But we hung in there and kept the two McLarens behind. Of course, very pleased to win here. I mean, it's my favourite track, home crowd, home feeling. So, yeah, just very nice always to be here.

Q: Max, just talk us through the move going into Turn 5 on Oscar on lap one. Were you surprised by your straight-line speed advantage?

MV: No. I knew that we had a little bit of a pace advantage on the straight. So, as soon as we got out of Turn 1, I knew that I would have a run to Turn 5.

Q: The setup worked well today. Do you see any reason to change it for the rest of the weekend?

MV: Need to have a look. Silverstone wasn't particularly fantastic for us on Sunday. So just need to have a double check, yeah, double check the weather basically, and we'll have a look what we'll do.

Q: Oscar, congratulations on P2. Although it was a slightly frustrating race for you staring at Max's gearbox for so long. Just how close did you get to making a move on him?

OP: Realistically, not that close. I think there was one or two times where I got within a car length but the problem is I didn't have enough. And Turn 5 is not really a corner where you can make a lunge on someone. Once they defend the inside, it's difficult to do anything. So I think realistically I was going to have to try and get past on the straight, which we were no chance of doing. A little bit frustrating, but we knew that was a possibility going into the Sprint and I was prepared for maybe not to be within eight tenths the whole race and not be able to do anything, but for this kind of result.

Q: And when you saw how easy it was for him to get past you up to Turn 5 on lap one, did you know at that moment that it was going to be very difficult for the rest of the race?

OP: Not necessarily. I was hoping we would be super quick in the middle sector and be able to hang on, but I think I could for the first part of the race. But spending that much time right behind someone, you overheat the tyres very quickly. Especially around here, they deg as well. It's not just getting hot. I think the back end of the race I lost some of the advantage in the middle sector that I had and obviously you don't gain anything more on the straight. So realistically I don't think we had quite enough to even get close enough, but we'll see what we can do for qualifying.

Q: What about tomorrow? The weather forecast looks like it's going to be rainy in the afternoon. What's the balance? Do you think you need more straight-line speed or are you going to play on the conservative side?

OP: I don't know yet. We'll wait and see. If it is wet, then naturally you want a bit more downforce, but if it's not wet, then I don't really want a repeat of the sprint race we've just had. So we'll have a look for sure, but it'll be interesting to see if anyone changes and which way we go.

Q: Lando, very well done on the P3. Just how much confidence does that sprint give you for the rest of the weekend?

LN: The same as what I had before. Like Oscar said, I think we knew we would find it tough to pass Max if he got ahead at the beginning. I got past Charles and from then it was just kind of a bit of a waiting game to see if anything happened, but nothing did. So I had confidence before that we would be quick. But here, you still need to be a bit quicker in this race than what we were today. Difficult. I think we probably have a quicker car altogether, but just not enough to overtake.

Q: Lando, what did we learn in that sprint that can help us for the rest of the weekend in terms of tyre wear? Franco Colapinto set his fastest lap on the soft tyre on the last lap. Just give us your thoughts on that.

LN: I don't know. Impressive. I don't know. The tyres are nowhere near good enough at the end, so I don't know if he just had some clearer air or something. I don't think that means anything. We'll see. We've just got qualifying ahead now, and then we'll wait and see what the weather makes us do tomorrow.

QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR

Q: (Leonid Kliuev – Grande Premio Brazil) A question for Max. Obviously, the first weekend for Laurent. Do you already see any changes in how the team operates? And also, how was the experience working with Simon Rennie again this weekend?

MV: It's very difficult to, within two weeks, suddenly say a lot of things need to change out of the blue. It's about starting the relationship and just understanding how everyone is operating. And then at one point, you come to conclusions and maybe you want to change something, and this is something that will happen over the coming weeks, months. So, it's really early days, but so far, he's very keen and very motivated, and that's exactly what you want also. I got on very well with him. So, yeah, it's been a very good start. And also with Simon, he has a lot of racing experience already. He's been part of the team for a very long time. The last few years, not anymore in a race engineer role, but he steps in and he's immediately on it. So again, very enjoyable to work with Simon.

Q: (Ronald Vording – Motorsport.com) A question for Max and one for Oscar, please. Max, what's your first impression of the upgrade package so far and does it make you feel any more comfortable in the car? And Oscar, were you surprised by their race pace, not just the straight-line speed, but also the tyres holding on towards the end of the Sprint?

MV: Yeah. I think it's been good. We just tried to optimize the car. We tried to put performance on it like everyone else, and I think we are doing that. So that's for sure a positive. We just need to keep doing that.

OP: I think it was probably a little bit better than I expected, but I wasn't expecting Max to be slow, that's for sure. I knew it was going to be a challenge, maybe not quite as difficult as it was, but I think, like I said before, after following so closely for so long, the tyres just naturally get to a point where they can't do much anymore, and it's a bit of an equaliser. So, it wasn't a big surprise for me.

Q: (Ian Parkes – RacingNews365.com) Max, any thoughts for the fact that you've actually given Laurent a winning start to his new job as Red Bull team principal? And also for the team as well. It's not a Grand Prix victory, but at least something to celebrate after all the turbulence of the past few weeks.

MV: The team can always count on me. They will always get my very best, whoever is in charge. They know that. I'm never holding back or anything. I'm always trying to give them the best possible result, and that's also what they pay me for. For sure, it's positive. We need, of course, positive energy, and that's a great start for us.

Q: (Josh Suttill – The Race) A question for Oscar. How much were you experimenting into La Source with the different lines? Because I think your race engineer said to be a bit more conservative at one point. And how much were you experimenting with the battery deployment as well to try and get past Max?

OP: I was trying. I was definitely trying. It's difficult because you want to save the battery at some points, you want to use it at some points, but you also don't want to drop too far back and give yourself too much of a gap to actually close up to because it wasn't as simple as just getting DRS and then letting DRS do the rest. You had to be even closer than that. That was tricky, but I certainly tried in those 15 laps, but to no avail.

Q: (Diletta Colombo – AutoMoto.it) A question for Max. You said before that you basically did 15 qualifying laps during the race. Do you think it could help you build the momentum to fight for the pole this afternoon?

MV: From what I've seen so far this weekend, I think that will be quite tough. But we'll try to improve the car a bit more. I think I got a bit more of an idea what I want with the car. Now is it always possible to do that with the car? I'm not sure. But we'll give it a go, and hopefully I can be close in qualifying.

Q: (Carlo Platella – FormulaPassion.it) Question for Max. You mentioned on the radio the good work with the battery management. How much in this case is up to you and how much do you need the instructions by the team?

MV: I think it's always something that you decide together. Of course already before the race, but even during the race, they have to update you as quickly as possible with these things. I think everyone does that. But it was good. It was very nice today.

ONBOARD: Lando Norris' 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the Belgian Grand Prix 

'I drove a tiny bit better' - Polesitter Norris on the small margins that made the difference in Spa Qualifying

Lando Norris, Oscar Piastri and Charles Leclerc report back after Qualifying for the Belgian Grand Prix.

1. Lando Norris (McLaren), 2. Oscar Piastri (McLaren), 3. Charles Leclerc (Ferrari)

PARC FERMÉ INTERVIEWS
(Conducted by Nico Rosberg)

Q: Wow. Charles Leclerc P3. Did you see that coming? I mean, I think you absolutely maximised it at the end there.

Charles LECLERC: Not really [I did not see it coming]. I mean, I'm very happy today. It's strange to say that because it's still three tenths and it's only a third place, but I did not expect it. We thought we were quite a lot more back. We knew that we had something more in the car obviously with the upgrade this weekend, but we still struggled yesterday. But that was a really, really good lap. I'm very happy with the lap, very happy how the car felt. So, it's good that we put everything together for quali.

Q: What'd you put it down to? Did you make some big changes or just found a better rhythm?

CL: No. I mean, obviously it takes a little bit of time to maximise those upgrades that we put on the car. So, there were a few things that we've changed, but nothing major. It was all about putting everything together and I felt comfortable with the car since FP1. So, it's good to have a qualifying where you look back and you know you haven't left anything on the table.

Q: I'm sure a podium then is your objective also for tomorrow, but you have Max Verstappen right behind you in fourth. Do you think you're going to be able to hold him behind?

CL: I don't know yet. For sure the race pace looked very strong this morning. I couldn't keep up with them. But again, with the small changes we've done, I hope that this gives us the upper hand tomorrow in the main race.

Q: Oscar, after yesterday's dominant qualifying, P1 yesterday in Sprint qualifying, today you can only manage second. Are you okay with that, or is that disappointing?

Oscar PIASTRI: A bit disappointing, yes. The second lap was coming together really well and just made a little mistake into 14 and lost a lot of time. So yeah, disappointed. Felt like the car was very good again, but it's fine margins out there. Obviously not a bad place to be starting, but I think there was more in it which is always disappointing.

Q: You're surprised also by how Lando was actually able to improve now throughout the weekend? Was he maybe learning stuff from you and looking at the data there?

OP: I don't know. I mean, I think we're a good team-mate pairing and we learn a lot from each other every weekend. That's what makes us such a good team but it also makes it difficult when you're trying to fight each other. So, I don't know. I feel like I did an okay job today, just didn't quite execute when it mattered and yeah, a bit of a shame.

Q: Being P2 on the grid then, are you actually happy that tomorrow it's looking very mixed on the weather? That could open things up and increase your chances to get one back on Lando tomorrow in the race?

OP: Yeah. I mean after the Sprint I was aiming for P2. I don't know what the weather's going to hold tomorrow. I think it's going to be quite different. So, we'll wait and see what we get. But yeah, try and have a good race.

Q: Lando, what an amazing job you did there. Great recovery also and great progress from earlier in the weekend. And that middle sector, how insane was that?

Lando NORRIS: Which one?

Q: The middle sector you put in.

LN: Oh, I don't know. Can't remember. I mean it was a decent lap, of course. So yeah, happy. I don't know. Everyone was pretty worried after yesterday. I wasn't even that far off. It was just a couple little issues that we had. So, I was confident after yesterday and confident coming into today. It's nice to see that I could get back to the top.

Q: Is there one thing you can point towards? Like yesterday you were almost five tenths off and now you're like one and a half tenths up. Where'd the improvement come from?

LN: Three tenths is just slipstream and not being first out the pit lane. So yeah, it was nothing to worry about. People like to make a lot of things up but no, I felt good. The car has been flying all weekend. Oscar's been doing a good job all weekend. So, we're pushing each other a lot like you said. It's tough because you kind of see where your strengths and weaknesses are easily and you learn from each other quickly. So, it's a good but tough battle that we have at the minute.

Q: You're the rain master from Silverstone. It's looking wet again tomorrow. You're confident though for the rain, even if it rains tomorrow?

LN: I mean I prefer it to stay dry honestly. Even for the fans. I think it's rained here for like the last ten years or something. So, it'd be nice to have a dry Sunday. But I don't mind whether it's dry or rain or whatever it is or somewhere in the middle. It's normal here and I look forward to a fun race.

PRESS CONFERENCE

Q: Many congratulations, Lando. A wonderful lap in Q3 gave you that pole. Just talk us through it. How good was it?

LN: Yeah. Obviously, good enough for pole. I felt like my second one, I improved, just the lap time didn't. So maybe a little bit more out there, but I think nice improvement from yesterday. Just nice to be in a better position in the pack and be out there again. So, a good day. The car's been feeling great all weekend, so it's nice to have a one-two.

Q: You say the second lap in Q3 felt better. Why do you think it wasn't faster? Is it down to track temperatures?

LN: No. I just think there were a couple of corners that I must have gone slower, I guess. I don't know why. I don't see if I'm going quicker or not on my lap. Maybe Turn 1, I hit the kerb a little bit, and it's a long run after Turn 1, so probably cost myself a little bit there. And the last corner, a bit too much kerb in both of them, and I probably lost, I mean, we're talking half a tenth, touch more, and I go slower. We're talking small margins, but yeah, that's it.

Q: Lando, it's your first time in the top three on the grid here at Spa. You've just averaged 156 miles an hour. Can you describe a pole lap around here? How does it feel? Is the rhythm different to other racetracks?

LN: I think what feels nice here quite often is just when you put a new set of tyres on, it's a good step of grip. There's not more pressure it just feels like you can push that 1-2% more, and that's always a good feeling. You have Turn 9, 5-6-7, you have Pouhon, 12-13, all corners which are pretty damn quick. You try to get that balance perfect with the car, getting the lifts right. A lot of it's about timings and just getting things nailed in terms of timing. It's a fun track. No matter how good you do, you always go into the last chicane and think, ‘Okay, just get this bit right'. It's a fun track in any car. I've driven here since Formula 4, quite a bit slower in that, but in Formula 1, it's good fun. It always puts a smile on your face during qualifying, especially when you can be on top.

Q: Thank you for that. Let's throw it ahead to tomorrow, Lando. How do you think it's going to play out?

LN: It's probably going to rain. I don't know much more than that. We'll wait and see. It's Spa, so high chance of rain, but that can also mean it just sometimes hits half the track and the other half stays dry. Could be in for a Silverstone-esque chaotic race, similar to Australia or Silverstone, the ones that are sometimes a bit in the middle. Most likely some rain and drizzle. Hard to know. We're going off the front, so hopefully, I can make an advantage of that and clean air and go from there.

Q: Do you think you've got a setup on the car that will help you rain or shine?

LN: I think we have the best car, so that's the most important thing.

Q: Very well done. Thank you for that, Lando. Oscar, very well done to you as well. You said a moment ago that you lost some time at Turn 14 on that second run. What did that cost you, do you think?

OP: A lot. Enough.

Q: Enough for pole?

OP: I think so, yeah. The lap until that point was strong, but it doesn't really matter if you could have done it. I didn't. A bit disappointing. I think both laps in Q3 were a little bit like that, but that's how it goes sometimes. A bit of a shame, but the car was great again. I felt like I was in a reasonably good flow. Just didn't quite happen on the second lap.

Q: Did the car feel different to Sprint Quali yesterday?

OP: Not really, no. In all honesty, it felt very similar. You get a few more laps on softs, you
explore the limits a bit more, you push the limit a bit more maybe, and today that probably bit. But it still felt very good. I had just as much confidence as yesterday, so it definitely wasn't that.

Q: What about the race then? Hoping that Lando will cut a nice hole in the air for you on the run up to Turn 5 on that opening lap?

OP: Let's see. If it's dry, then yes. If it's wet, then it obviously adds in some other challenges, but we'll have to wait and see what the weather does first. I know what I'm hoping for.

Q: Alright, Oscar. Thank you very much. Very well done to you. Charles, great job by you as well. Just how much of a surprise is it to be in the top three for quali here?

CL: Quite big. I think we expected to be P4, but with a significant gap in front. At the end, the gap is still significant, but a little bit less than what we initially expected, so that's positive. We brought upgrades this weekend which have been working since the beginning, but we had to do some fine tunings from yesterday to today. It's going in the right direction, so I'm very happy. I think it was also a really good lap. I don't think I left much on the table with the potential we had today, so for that, I'm happy as well. However, it's only P3, so now we'll see what we can do tomorrow.

Q: You say the upgrades are going in the right direction. How different does the car feel with them?

CL: A little bit. But then I think as always, especially for our team, everything is hyped up a lot. Yes, it's an upgrade and it's a step in the right direction, but we are still speaking about very fine differences over a whole lap. So, it feels a little bit different, and it's going in the right direction. Again, that's thanks to the hard work that the whole team has done back at the factory. Unfortunately for us, McLaren has also brought a few things this weekend and seem to have done a small step in the right direction as well. So, it's very difficult to close the gap. But I think we are doing a good job as a team and we just need to keep working.

Q: And Charles, where's your battle tomorrow? Do you think you can do anything about the guys sat next to you if it's wet? Or are you going to be looking in your mirrors?

CL: Wet weather, we were speaking about it in the last race weekend. I don't think it's a strength for our car at the moment. We are really struggling. But having said that, every weekend is different. We'll learn from the past and see what's possible tomorrow. I will only be able to tell after the first few laps to see where we are. But I'll try to look forward before looking in mirrors.

QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR

Q: (Christian Menath – Motorsport-magazin.com) Question to all three of you. It was quite obvious that Red Bull changed the setup quite a lot because of the weather forecast for tomorrow. They put on a much bigger wing. How about you three? Did you change the car setup quite a lot for tomorrow?

LN: No.

OP: Didn't change it either.

Q: (Edd Straw – The Race) One for you, Charles. As you said, the upgrade was a step in the right direction, but I'm not trying to hype it too much. Does it at least give you confidence that the second half of the year can be a little bit better than the first and perhaps that some of the limitations you've been stuck with are at least being chipped away at so that things should continue to improve?

CL: Yes and no. I think it's definitely going in the right direction once again as I was saying. However, compared to the McLaren, I think we are probably on average three or four tenths behind in qualifying. We'll do a step forward. I don't think though that we'll find those three or four tenths in that upgrade. But it will help us to get closer. The more we use it, the more we'll be able to maximize this and there'll be some more potential to gain. But no, I don't think it's enough to be able to challenge the McLaren consistently from now on.

Q: (Ian Parkes – Racing News 365) Lando, primarily, but if either of the other two, Charles or Oscar, wish to chip in, please do. After the two Turn 5 overtakes in the Sprint race, there was one overtake for the remainder of the 15 laps, and that was yours on Charles. If the race is dry, if the forecast is wrong, can we expect something similar tomorrow – just a real struggle to make a pass? Because that's the way it looked. Obviously, today the DRS just wasn't working.

LN: No. I think as soon as you start to bring in some strategy and tyre differences, especially with the C1 to the C3, C4 jump, I definitely expect more racing if it was to be dry tomorrow. The tricky thing is you're talking about the field being more compact than ever, which puts on a good show in qualifying and things are tight and thrilling and great to watch. But that often just makes it trickier at times for the racing. The gaps are smaller, you can make smaller differences from car to car and driver to driver. So, there are pros and cons in everything. The more we develop these cars, generally the trickier it becomes to overtake and to follow as well. It's never an easy one to get right. But I'm sure if it was a dry race tomorrow, I'd expect more racing. I don't expect it to be dry, so I expect just more racing and more chaos anyway. But I think sometimes there are some Sprints every now and then that are like that because everyone's pushing a bit more flat out through the race. You're thinking less of strategy. You're not thinking of doing a one or two-stop. So, we'll wait and find out.

Q: (Luke Smith – The Athletic) Charles, another one for you on the upgrade. You've talked earlier this year about needing to do quite extreme things with the setup to get into a good window. Has this helped at all with that? Are you still having to go to those lengths? And what kind of comfort has this update given you?

CL: It's a little bit better. I think that's what helped me also a little bit this weekend to be a bit more consistent. The lap times in qualifying, both yesterday in Sprint Qualifying and today, came together a bit easier. That's been my strength normally, but this year I've been struggling a little bit more to put everything together in qualifying. This weekend seems to be better, but we just need to prove that over multiple race weekends because it's also… I mean, the grip this weekend here is incredible. There's so much grip – but that's not only for us, but I also think for everybody. Generally, this makes it easier. So, we'll have to prove that on a track that is a bit trickier.

Q: (Rodrigo França – Car Magazine Brazil). Question to Oscar. Considering what we saw today in the Sprint race, can we say that Spa-Francorchamps has kind of two pole positions because in the front row you have a very strong chance to attack in Turn 3?

OP: In the dry, potentially. But there have also been times where pole has maintained the lead – unfortunately, not this morning. It's probably the hardest track to maintain the lead on the calendar from the start. If the weather is wet though, I think pole position is an advantage, but it also depends on how wet it is. Whether Eau Rouge is flat or not makes a big difference.

ONBOARD: Lando Norris' 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the Belgian Grand Prix 

'I drove a tiny bit better' - Polesitter Norris on the small margins that made the difference in Spa Qualifying

The McLaren pair of Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris have given their take on the Sprint at the Belgian Grand Prix.

Oscar Piastri conceded that it was “a bit frustrating” to not be able to overtake Max Verstappen during the Sprint at the Belgian Grand Prix, while McLaren team mate Lando Norris admitted that the team may need to “reassess” prior to Qualifying later on Saturday.

Despite initially holding onto the lead at the start of the event, Piastri lost the position to Verstappen later in the lap as the Dutchman surged past on the Kemmel Straight – and from there onwards the Australian was unable to retake P1, despite trying to chase down the Red Bull.

Asked afterwards if Lap 1 had played out as he expected, Piastri responded: “Pretty much, yeah. I tried my best to snake my way through the straights and not give too much of a tow, but I just didn't have enough straight-line speed, and then obviously, I didn't have enough straight-line speed for the next 15 laps either.

“Still a good result, still good points. It is only the Sprint and the main points are tomorrow. I'm pretty happy with it, just obviously a bit frustrating that I couldn't get past.”

Pushed on whether the team may trim some downforce from the car ahead of Sunday's Grand Prix to prevent the same scenario from happening again, Piastri said: “It's a great question.

“The weather is looking pretty bad tomorrow, which obviously means you don't want to take off too much wing, but I don't really want to repeat the Sprint we've just had. We'll have a look and see what we can do, but there are a lot of things to look into before tomorrow.”

Despite being left disappointed by his result in the Sprint, Piastri is remaining optimistic about Qualifying later on Saturday.

“I'm looking forward to it,” he explained. “Spa is my favourite track of the year, and especially in Qualifying, it's just mega around here. I'm looking forward to some more laps in anger.”

Behind him, Piastri's team mate Norris had to settle for third place. After being overtaken by Ferrari's Charles Leclerc on Lap 1, the Briton later retook the place and tried to chase down Verstappen and Piastri up ahead. However, like Piastri, Norris was unable to make a move.

“[It was] a bit of fun at the start with trying to overtake Charles,” Norris reflected after the Sprint. “Maybe I could have positioned myself a little bit better, but otherwise, it was a bit too difficult to get past Max.

“Max drove a good race and I wasn't going to get past anyone unless Oscar got past Max. They drove good races. Not a lot we could do on a day like today, so I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

“Obviously, I hoped for a bit of battling or something, but the Red Bull was too quick in the straight for us to catch up. Maybe some tweaks for us to make into Qualifying. I don't know, but we'll reassess and see what we can do.”

Norris arrives into the weekend off the back of two consecutive victories in Austria and Great Britain and is still aiming to make it a hat-trick of wins on Sunday at Spa-Francorchamps.

“That's the plan,” the 25-year-old said. “I'm not too fussed about Sprint races, but obviously, the main race, I prefer to win. We'll see.

“I wasn't too bad yesterday. I was still comfortable, it's just a couple of things didn't go my way, but I'm still confident that we can have a good result later and finish with some good Quali laps.”

'I drove a tiny bit better' - Polesitter Norris on the small margins that made the difference in Spa Qualifying

Invicta Racing's Leonardo Fornaroli took his second consecutive Sprint Race victory with his triumph in Belgium.

Invicta Racing's Leonardo Fornaroli took his second consecutive Sprint Race victory – following his win at Silverstone – with a brilliant drive at Spa-Francorchamps.

The Italian made a great start from third to take the lead into Turn 1, and from there on he fought off the challenge of Amaury Cordeel and managed a Safety Car restart to win the race.

Cordeel had been running second but contact with Victor Martins knocked him out of the race, with the ART Grand Prix driver finishing in P2 after starting in sixth.

PREMA Racing's Gabriele Minì charged through from eighth on the grid to finish in third, while pole-sitter Oliver Goethe wound up in fourth for MP Motorsport.

Goethe held of his fellow Red Bull Junior Josep María Martí in the final few laps, with the Campos Racing driver forced to settle for fifth.

Roman Stanek put two Invicta cars in the points with a run to sixth, ahead of Rodin Motorsport's Alexander Dunne, as ART's Ritomo Miyata took the final point in P8.

Dunne is set to start from pole position in Sunday's Feature Race, where he will be joined on the front row by Miyata.

Lights out is set for 10:00 local time on Sunday, but until then, you can read an in-depth report of the FIA Formula 2 Sprint Race from Spa on the official website here.

ONBOARD: Lando Norris' 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the Belgian Grand Prix 

'I drove a tiny bit better' - Polesitter Norris on the small margins that made the difference in Spa Qualifying

Matt Youson takes a look at the different pit stop and tyre options that are available to the teams in the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa.

There was daylight between McLaren and the chasing pack in Saturday's Qualifying – but this isn't a race that's going to be won or lost by a couple of tenths on a low-fuel lap. Tyre deltas, degradation, end-of-straight speed and a weather forecast that's… exciting… are going to play their part in a race that certainly isn't going to be static.

This perhaps, is not what Lando Norris, taking his fourth pole of the season and winner last time out at Silverstone, wants to hear, but it will provide considerably more cheer for team mate and Championship leader Oscar Piastri, starting P2, and Sprint winner Max Verstappen, starting P4… or anyone looking to make an impact with smart strategic thinking.

There's two versions of this: the one that involves the chequered flag and the podium, and the other that brings in the scrutineers, the weighbridge and Document 44 formally disqualifying George Russell.

Let's take the second one first. The race was a two-stopper, with a top three of Lewis Hamilton, Oscar Piastri and Charles Leclerc all running a very similar medium>hard>hard strategy.

Lando Norris, classified P5, and Esteban Ocon in P9 did the same. They all pitted between Laps 11-15, and then again between Laps 25-30. At other circuits, that might appear as quite a narrow window, but in the context of a 44-lap Belgian Grand Prix on F1's longest track, it's more of a gaping chasm.

There were plenty of variations on a theme with Max Verstappen finishing fourth on a medium>hard>medium strategy, Carlos Sainz sixth with hard>medium>hard, Sergio Perez seventh with medium>medium>hard (plus two laps at the end on soft to bag the extra point and set the lap record).

Daniel Ricciardo was 10th, being the only driver to fit a soft tyre for strategic purposes, running soft>medium>hard but the real outlier in the list is Fernando Alonso. The Spanish driver was classified P8, hanging it out for a tough one-stop of medium>hard, making his solitary pit stop on lap 13.

Alonso, of course, looked like being the second one-stopper home, with George Russell taking the flag and standing on the top step of the podium. Russell started P6, made a place on the first lap, and pitted early, on Lap 10, when running P5. He held position through the stops, and rose through the leading pack when cars ahead started to duck in for their second stops.

At some point during the middle stint, Mercedes decided he had the tyres to make it work, and so Russell simply kept going, surviving late pressure from team-mate Hamilton to win by 0.526s. However, his car was 1.5kg below the minimum weight of 798kg so it was an easy decision for the stewards that in no way negates a perfectly executed strategic ambush.

Pirelli are trying something a little different this year with a compound bridge in place. Last year we had the C2, C3 and C4; this year we have the C1, C3 and C4. The original intention was to introduce a genuine dilemma between a flat-out two stop and a more managed one-stop.

Conditions this weekend mean it's not quite the designed choice – but there are plenty of options, depending on track temperature, ability to run in clean air, set-up decisions and – as is usually the case – what everyone else is doing.

Pirelli's sims suggest the two-stop race is the fastest way to the flag… just. Their favoured strategy is a soft>medium>medium race with unusually wide pit windows. They have an optimal first stop between Laps 12-18, and a second between 25-31. This is very different to the preferred options in last year's race when the soft tyre was not popular – but the tyres are a little more resilient in 2025.

It's the tortoise or the hare today – if you accept a few minor tweaks to a narrative that now has a highly-motivated tortoise with a turn of speed unwitnessed in most chelonians, and a hare that's lacking even an ounce of complacency. It's close between one and two stops, and could easily be the sort of decision that teams don't take until mid-race. It has an optimum window between Laps 16-22 of the 44.

“In our calculations, the two-stop soft>medium>medium is quicker than the one-stop soft>medium… but by just a few seconds,” says Pirelli motorsport director Mario Isola. “Tomorrow [Sunday] with lower temperatures and, because of those temperatures, degradation that can be more easily managed, soft>medium could be an option. It will need quite a high level of management… but it is possible.”

A mixed grid at Spa is not an unfamiliar sight – but generally it's been with engine penalties doing the damage. This year… we simply have a mixed grid – 13 places between Leclerc and Hamilton; 10 between Alex Albon and Sainz; 12 separating Russell and Kimi Antonelli.

There are cars with potential to be quick, threaded right through the field. Overtaking looked difficult in the Sprint – but with everyone on the same tyre of the same age, that's often the case in the first stint of a race also, but as degradation and tyre deltas come into play, things start to become more fluid.

Given the length of the straights at Spa, quick cars don't have to play long odds strategies to get up the field, they can simply drive a deterministic race and let pace win out.

But, for anyone wanting to try something different, there's another one-stop strategy available. Medium>hard has a pit window between Laps 17-23. On paper it's not quite as quick as the strategies involving a soft tyre – but it really does depend on which Spa turns up tomorrow.

We're at Spa so, frankly, what isn't the weather doing? So far this weekend we've had brilliant sunshine, light drizzle, heavy rain and an F3 session postponed because the medevac helicopter doesn't fly in heavy fog. Chances are it won't snow on Sunday, but everything else is on the table.

The forecast, as of Saturday evening, suggested a very wet Sunday – albeit with the race at the time most likely to be dry. There's an 80 per cent chance of rain in the morning, gradually decreasing through the early afternoon to 40 per cent between 1500-1700, before rising again to make the teams thoroughly miserable during pack-down.

Even if it doesn't rain during the race, rain before will have a significant impact on the viability of the hard compound. It looked good on Friday – but in cooler conditions and a track washed clean, it's going to slide around a lot, and suffer in much the same way it does in Barcelona.

ONBOARD: Lando Norris' 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the Belgian Grand Prix 

'I drove a tiny bit better' - Polesitter Norris on the small margins that made the difference in Spa Qualifying

On a weekend in which Ferrari are running an upgrade, Charles Leclerc displayed good pace to claim third place in Qualifying for the Belgian Grand Prix.

Charles Leclerc was left “very happy” after claiming third place on the grid for the Belgian Grand Prix, with the Monegasque hailing his effort as a “really good lap”.

On a weekend in which Ferrari are running a revised rear suspension, Leclerc went one better than his fourth place result earlier on in Saturday's Sprint to be the best of the rest behind the McLarens of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri in Qualifying.

“I'm very happy today – it's strange to say that because it's still three-tenths [back] and it's only a third place, but I did not expect it,” Leclerc reflected after the session.

“We thought we were quite a lot more back. We knew that we had something more in the car obviously with the upgrade this weekend, but we still struggled yesterday. But this was a really good lap.

“I'm very happy with the lap, very happy with how the car felt, so it's good that we put everything together for Quali.”

When quizzed on what he put it down to, Leclerc responded: “It obviously takes a bit of time to maximise those upgrades that we put on the car, so there were some little things that we changed, but nothing major.

“It was all about putting everything together. I've felt comfortable with the car since FP1, so it's good to have a Qualifying where you look back and know you haven't left anything on the table.”

During Saturday's Sprint, Leclerc initially overtook Norris for third before later losing the place again. With this in mind, the 25-year-old is unsure whether a podium will be possible in Sunday's Grand Prix, in which he will line up one place ahead of Max Verstappen.

“I don't know yet but, for sure, their race pace this morning looked very strong,” said Leclerc. “I couldn't keep up with them. But again, with the small changes that we've done, I hope that this gives us the upper hand in the main race.”

'I drove a tiny bit better' - Polesitter Norris on the small margins that made the difference in Spa Qualifying

The drivers and teams report back on all the action from the Sprint and Qualifying at Spa-Francorchamps ahead of the Belgian Grand Prix.

Piastri made a good start to the Sprint but was powerless to prevent Verstappen flying past down the Kemmel Straight once the Dutchman got into the slipstream. Leclerc pulled off a similar move on Norris. But Norris was able to fight back and overtake Leclerc, then closing in on the front two. Verstappen made no mistakes in the closing stages, so gave no opportunities to Piastri or Norris, who just did not have enough straight-line speed to challenge the Red Bull for the win.

The good news for McLaren is that their one-lap pace was still superior to the rest of the field, as their drivers locked-out the front row for the Grand Prix. Piastri made the smallest of errors on his final flying run, which made all the difference as Norris bagged his fourth pole of the season.

Lando Norris, Sprint: 3rd, Qualifying: 1st, 1:40.562

“It was a decent lap and I'm very happy. I was confident after yesterday and confident coming into today and it's nice to see that I could get back to the top. The car has been flying all weekend and I feel good. Oscar's been doing a good job all weekend too, we're pushing each other a lot. It's a good but tough battle that we have at the minute.

“The weather looks interesting for tomorrow. I don't mind if we have sun, rain or a bit of both. It's normal here at Spa and I'm looking forward to a fun race whatever we get.”

Oscar Piastri, Sprint: 2nd, Qualifying: 2nd, 1:40.647

“Starting P2 tomorrow. I'm a little bit disappointed as I didn't put the lap together in the final run of Q3, losing time at Turn 14, but it's incredibly fine margins out there, and it felt like the car was in a really good place again. The weather tomorrow means it's tricky to predict what will happen, but starting on the front row is always a good thing. We'll work through it all overnight and be ready to go racing tomorrow.”

Andrea Stella, Team Principal

“The team and drivers did a great job today to come away with a double podium in this morning's Sprint and a 1-2 result in Qualifying for tomorrow's Grand Prix, with both Lando and Oscar delivering superb pace.

""This morning's Sprint race didn't deliver quite the result we wanted with Oscar taking second and Lando third, but it has put us in good condition to make some improvements ahead of tomorrow's race.

""The weather will certainly play its part on race day, as is so often the case here in Spa, and both Red Bull and Ferrari have made improvements today which will put us under pressure from the start. The whole team will make sure we are in the best position possible to finish the weekend with a victory and more valuable points in both championships.”

Red Bull had opted for a skinny rear wing for the Sprint, and it proved a masterstroke. With better straight line speed than McLaren, Verstappen was able to overtake Piastri on the opening lap. From there, the Dutchman drove perfectly to keep the arguably faster McLarens at bay as he took the Sprint win here as he did in 2023. Tsunoda came home down the order, unable to make much of an impact in the tight midfield.

But the Japanese racer did much better come Qualifying, making Q3 for the first time since Miami and going on to grab his best Qualifying performance since he joined Red Bull. Verstappen was a touch more disappointed, unable to split the McLarens again after adding some downforce to his car with a view to tomorrow's weather forecast.

Max Verstappen, Sprint: 1st, Qualifying: 4th, 1:40.903

“It was amazing to get the Sprint win here today and finishing P1 at my favourite track is always great. It was good for us to have the top speed advantage that we had; I wasn't sure if we could keep the McLarens behind but we didn't make many mistakes and had really good battery management. It was a nice surprise, we worked really well as a Team and it was a good boost for everyone today going into the rest of the weekend. For Qualifying, honestly, I was hoping for a little bit more. For some reason in Q3 I just didn't have the same grip and feeling in the car. I was hoping that the set up that we had would help the driving feeling, but this wasn't the case and the balance wasn't where we wanted it to be. I felt like I couldn't push the car to the limit and attack the corners how I like, which you really need to do here in Spa. I had a wheel spin on the last corner of the first lap and, on the second lap, I was down on my lap time already on turn one which wasn't ideal. We were pretty close to the McLarens, so it was a shame to finish P4 as we were at least hoping to be P3. Fighting for the win will be tough as both McLarens will still be fast in the wet, so we don't expect any miracles. We want to fight back for a podium and lot could happen in the race with the weather.""

Yuki Tsunoda, Sprint: 11th, Qualifying: 7th, 1:41.284

“The Sprint wasn't the start to the day that we were wanting and my pace really didn't stack up against my management of the car but the Team really turned things around very quickly ahead of Qualifying. P7 for my 100th start tomorrow is so exciting, it feels like yesterday that I had my first ever race in Bahrain and it really has been an interesting journey these past five years. The F1 environment can be hard but all you can do is keep pushing which is what we did today. It is a great feeling being back to the place where I should be, but I would like to say a huge thank you to my mechanics who managed to make the upgrade to the floor ahead of Qualifying. The upgrade allowed me to really push and drive much closer to the limit than has been possible previously, the car is sliding less and is a lot more forgiving, really it's a huge credit to the Team. I really enjoyed the drive today and am feeling more confident going into race day tomorrow, we know that it is likely to rain but our hybrid set up means that we are prepared for the wet or the dry but obviously I would prefer the dry. My main focus now is on scoring points tomorrow and extracting as much performance as possible from the car. Seeing Laurent at the end of Qualifying gave me flashbacks from when we worked together at Visa Cash App Racing Bulls, he smiled directly at me as soon as I pulled in today and it really boosted my confidence.""

Laurent Mekies, Team Principal

""It was a very positive start to the day with a win in the Sprint. This was down to the enormous effort from everyone in the factory to deliver key upgrades, and from there it was an incredible job from Max. He had only one shot to make the move on Oscar and he nailed it, after that it was a masterclass of defence and tyre management, well supported by the Team. Qualifying was a smooth session but nowhere near perfect and it was certainly a little bit more difficult to extract everything from the car for Max. This is something for us as a Team to look at. The gap to McLaren is probably fair, it is reflecting the reality and it is still a bit frustrating to miss out. For Yuki it was a really positive step forward this weekend and it is good to see him in Q3. He progressed very well, and his best Qualifying result for the Team should give him a good boost of confidence. We upgraded his car just before Qualifying, giving him the same updated floor as Max, although not the same front wing. A big thank you for the huge effort from the crew to get that car ready on time. We will fight from P4 and P7 tomorrow and everything is to play for. We will see what the weather is like, we are not desperate for rain but we have made choices on the car to prepare for variable weather. The rain is probably the best chance to mix up the cards and to get closer to McLaren but if it's a drier day we will still take the fight and it will be down to how we play the game and tyre management.""

Leclerc managed to pick off Norris on the opening lap, but soon lost out to the McLaren man. He then wound up a lonely fourth, well off the pace of the front three. Hamilton could not make up many places after a poor Sprint Qualifying, but he did at least learn plenty about the new rear suspension upgrades.

Hamilton's day did not improve come Qualifying, when his last lap time in Q1 was deleted for exceeding track limits through Raidillon. That dropped him out in Q1, on what has been a disappointing weekend so far. Leclerc did make Q3, and managed to extract absolutely everything on his final flying run to grab third, winding up just 0.003s ahead of Verstappen's Red Bull.

Charles Leclerc, Sprint: 4th, Qualifying: 3rd, 1:40.900

""I'm very happy today, despite us still being three tenths off pole. We put it all together and it feels good to look back at qualifying knowing that we haven't left anything on the table with the potential we had today. I've felt comfortable in the car since FP1 and we've learned a lot about our upgrades. Our competitors in the front look strong but with the small changes we've made to the car with the race in mind, I hope we can put up a good fight tomorrow.""

Lewis Hamilton, Sprint: 15th, Qualifying: 16th, 1:41.939

""It's not been a great day but we got some valuable insight into the new suspension and upgrades during the Sprint.

""The team made further adjustments ahead of qualifying based on what we learned. Unfortunately, my lap time was deleted for track limits, and I take full responsibility for that. Tomorrow's race will be challenging, with overtaking being quite difficult here, but I'm fully focused on making up ground and fighting for points to reward the hard work everyone's done back at the factory to bring these updates.""

Fred Vasseur, Team Principal

""Charles did a very good lap at the end. Currently we are still working on getting the most out of the new package we brought here and there was real improvement over the course of the weekend from the start all the way to the final lap in qualifying. We learned more about the car from session to session. Rain is expected tomorrow that will also allow us to see how these upgrades work in all conditions. We are still a couple of tenths behind McLaren but we are on the pace of Verstappen. We will continue to work on improving still further for Budapest.

""As for Lewis, he was unable to put everything together but the field is so close, a matter of just hundredths or even thousandths of a second between the cars. His pace was good, he was just one place behind Charles but the track limits put him out and it is what it is. It's true that it's been a tough weekend for him so far and, at this track, you need to build up confidence lap after lap and with the problems yesterday and today that was made difficult for him.""

After a difficult Sprint Qualifying session, it was always going to be hard for the Mercedes drivers to make much progress in the Sprint. Russell made up one place at least, with the team hopefully learning plenty ahead of tomorrow's Grand Prix. Russell made Q3 in Qualifying too as his weekend started to improve, although he did admit afterwards to a slightly compromised set-up for the race – especially if it rains.

Antonelli could not join him there, the youngster once again exiting at the first time of asking. Like his predecessor Hamilton, he is having what can only be described as a very difficult weekend.

George Russell, Sprint: 12th, Qualifying: 6th, 1:41.260

""Today was a better day than Friday in terms of the result but, if you take out yesterday, then this was one of our worst Qualifying performances of the year. We are struggling here in Spa this weekend and we are working hard to understand why. We were potentially slightly light on rear wing level, given we were fastest in sectors one and three, but that is really just a compromise of where you gain lap time across the circuit.

""Starting P6 tomorrow still gives us a chance of fighting for decent points for tomorrow. We set the car up today so we could maximise Qualifying, so we will have to see what the weather does tomorrow. If it does rain, we may be slightly compromised but I'd much rather be starting in P6 with that than outside of the top 10. Let's see what happens on Sunday.""

Kimi Antonelli, Sprint: 17th, Qualifying: 18th, 1:42.139

""That was another difficult day in what has been a tricky period for us over the past few races. I was struggling with the car balance on Friday and that continued into Qualifying today. The confidence wasn't there and that showed in the lap time. It is frustrating as we know we have more pace than we showed today.

""We are working hard to improve so we can get back on track and putting in good results. Whilst Qualifying didn't go the way we want, we have a chance to do that tomorrow. The weather forecast is changeable, and we may have rain. That would give us a chance to make up more positions than may be possible in a standard dry race.""

Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport

""As a team, this weekend has fallen far below our standards so far. It has been our weakest performance this year and we need to quickly understand why. We have struggled with a car facing several balance limitations, losing the vast majority of our lap time in the middle sector. We knew we would struggle to get into the points in the Sprint given our starting positions, so focused on improving these balance issues for Qualifying. Unfortunately, we couldn't make sufficient headway and suffered as a result.

""With a mixed weather forecast for tomorrow's race, we will be looking to take advantage of any opportunities that come our way. We are not fooling ourselves though; the pace of our car has not been sufficient this weekend to challenge at the front and that is unlikely to change tomorrow. We will race hard to maximise our result but must ensure we start the weekend in a much stronger position in Budapest next week.""

Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director

""That was another disappointing day for us here in Spa. We were looking to bounce back from a tough Friday, knowing that the big points were still on offer ahead of us. Starting from outside the top 10 in the Sprint, we knew that progress would be difficult to achieve. The low wing levels being run here result in a modest DRS effect and other than Kimi making one pass, we were unable to make any further overtakes.

""We made quite significant changes to our car for Qualifying but the underlying limitations were still there and neither driver had good confidence in the rear end. Kimi was eliminated in the first cut; George did a good job to get as far as P6 but it's clear we have to get to the bottom of the issues with the car as it simply wasn't quick. We're expecting some rain for the race tomorrow. Considering our starting positions that's a good thing, and hopefully both drivers can move forward if we operate well, but our bigger focus is to understand why our pace has been so poor at this track.""

Sainz started sixth in the Sprint and finished sixth, picking up three points for his team – his first score since Canada, and biggest points haul since Imola. He came close to getting Ocon too but just did not have enough straight-line speed to chase down the Haas.

The Spaniard's Qualifying did not go to plan, as he could not find much pace in Q2 and exited in P15. But Albon took the opportunity to shine instead, as he made Q3 and once there grabbed a season's best P5 on the grid. His car looks to be there on merit too, so the Thai driver will certainly be hunting a good haul of points tomorrow.

Alex Albon, Sprint: 16th, Qualifying: 5th, 1:41.201

""I'm really happy. We fixed the issue we had on Friday, which made the biggest difference. The lap felt tricky, and it was difficult to see where I could find the lap time, so I wasn't expecting to make such a big step forward in Q3. The working window for the tyres is very narrow and we did a good job to find that sweet spot to pull it all together. Our race pace feels strong, so I'm hoping for a relatively straightforward race tomorrow.""

Carlos Sainz, Sprint: 6th, Qualifying: 15th, 1:41.758

""Disappointed with this result. I had a strong lap in Q1 but didn't manage to go any faster in Q2, as I didn't manage to find grip. We've tried different directions with car balance and experimented a bit with set-up throughout the weekend, but obviously today didn't go our way and we need to analyse it. Hopefully tomorrow there will be opportunities as it could be wet, so let's keep focused as the weekend is not over yet.""

_James Vowles, Team Principal

""What a fantastic day all-round. This morning, with Carlos finishing P6 in the Sprint Race, demonstrating good performance across the two days, and this afternoon with Alex securing P5, our best Qualifying result since Vegas last year.

""We made some improvements to the car since yesterday, working mostly well. I think with Carlos, there's an interesting quirk with Sprint Qualifying sessions in that you must use a set of Soft tyres in SQ3. This meant that in Q2 today, we had to use one used and one new set of tyres. Then, as the track warmed up, he struggled to find the same lap time as we had previously.

""I'm optimistic for tomorrow and look forward to it. I think the weather conditions could play a part but we're in a strong position with two strong drivers.""

Hadjar moved up a slot to eighth when Gasly did not take the start, and was able to hold that position to the finish to grab the final point on offer. It could have been more though, Hadjar stuck right behind Bearman's Haas for lap after lap – but he could not find a way past, despite a few attempts.

The Frenchman's day continued to look good on paper but be frustrating in reality, when he qualified eighth – believing more was possible when the margins were incredibly tight. Lawson was ninth, just 0.018s behind his team mate as Racing Bulls look poised for more points tomorrow.

Isack Hadjar, Sprint: 8th, Qualifying: 8th, 1:41.310

""It was a good Sprint for us this morning. We showed a really good pace and we managed to score a point. In Qualifying, both Liam and I got into the rhythm very quickly. I'm very satisfied, but I just expected a bit more than a P8, as we started the session really strong and Alex in P5 is just a tenth away from us, so I feel like I could have done a better job. Overall, we have a stable car, which has worked really well, and it gave me confidence from the beginning, so I'm definitely proud of the team. We have a strong pace and we also start within the points tomorrow. We know that there's a chance for a wet race but I'm happy with our car setup, so the aim is obviously to be in the fight to try and get some points.”

Liam Lawson, Sprint: 10th, Qualifying: 9th, 1:41.328

""It was a good session for the team having both cars reach Q3, but it's tough when you see P5 was so close. The speed was building and we were learning throughout the session, but a moment at the end of the lap meant we lost some time, so with such close margins it's frustrating. Regardless of the conditions tomorrow, we need to try and have a clean race while extracting everything out of the car.”

Guillaume Dezoteux, Head of Vehicle Performance

“A good day for us today. The pace in the Sprint race was good, but with everybody on the same tyre, it was extremely difficult to overtake. Nevertheless, Isack scored a point, which rewarded the good work done by the team. Qualifying was great with both cars in Q3, which puts us in a strong position for the race tomorrow. The weather may play a big part, with rain expected, but our car has worked really well in the more technical middle sector today giving us confidence for tomorrow and a target to score points with both cars.”

Haas, like Red Bull, opted for a skinny rear wing and a low downforce set-up for the Sprint. That paid dividends, with Ocon and Bearman both able to finish in the points. Ocon was able to hold Sainz at bay for a ‘best of the rest' P5 while Bearman somehow kept Hadjar behind, despite the Frenchman being within half a second for nearly the entire Sprint.

They added some downforce for Qualifying, and lost some of their raw pace as a result. But considering Qualifying has been their Achilles' Heel this season, getting both cars to the fringes of the top 10 is still a handy result, especially considering their race pace is often better than their one-lap prowess.

Esteban Ocon, Sprint: 5th, Qualifying: 11th, 1:41.525

“I'm super pleased with the Sprint, six points for the team today is a really good result. We can be satisfied with that as the cars in front were out of reach, so we finished on top of our race, so to speak. It was very close out there in qualifying this afternoon, but there are some positives as we've fixed some issues with the balance of the car. It's still a decent starting position and we're only one place away from a point which is pretty good, so we need to maximise the potential there.”

Oliver Bearman, Sprint: 7th, Qualifying: 12th, 1:41.617

“I lost three tenths in Turn 1 as my tyres were just not ready. After that, I managed to bring it back and do a very good lap, but it was a big shame as we really had the pace to be in Q3. We added a lot of downforce so hopefully that plays into our hands tomorrow. The Sprint was good, and it was nice to score some points – getting both cars into the points in a Sprint is no mean feat.”

Ayao Komatsu, Team Principal

“The Sprint was very good; we wanted to convert our starting positions of P5 and P7 into results, and we finished exactly there. Six points is an amazing result. For qualifying, we had to consider the weather for tomorrow as there's a high chance it's going to rain. It's tricky to decide direction, so we split listening to driver feedback to cover the widest range as a team. It's frustrating and a bit deflating right now because we have speed. We lost out getting to Q3 by a tiny margin to Albon and he qualified P5, so I feel that's where our potential is. The good thing is, with Ollie's set-up especially, he's very confident and our target is double points again.”

Bortoleto inherited an effective P9 on the grid after Gasly failed to start, but he just could not chase down Hadjar ahead for the final point. Finishing ninth is still an encouraging result for the rookie, especially considering Hulkenberg wound up way down the order. The Brazilian continued his strong form in Qualifying, making the top 10 yet again. He had no fresh tyres for Q3, but qualifying 10th is still a very handy result. Hulkenberg was further down the order after a messy session where his front wing was broken in the pit lane.

The German attempted to edge into the fast lane, only to collide with Stroll's Aston Martin. The stewards had a look at the incident, and opted to give Kick Sauber a reprimand for the incident.

Nico Hulkenberg, Sprint: 18th, Qualifying: 14th, 1:41.707

“Qualifying didn't quite go our way today – I was lacking a bit too much on the straights, and without a proper tow, we left a couple of tenths on the table, which made the difference in the end. On the positive side, the car felt much better today compared to Friday. We already made a step forward in the Sprint this morning, which gave me more confidence heading into qualifying. Sprint weekends are always a bit of a challenge – limited track time, and if you're out early in SQ1, you miss out on valuable laps. We approached the Sprint more like an extended practice session: with the data we gathered we made solid progress and I found a better rhythm on this particular track layout. In terms of setup, we also factored in the possibility of rain tomorrow – probably like everyone else. Now let's see what the race brings.”

Gabriel Bortoleto, Sprint: 9th, Qualifying: 10th, 1:42.387

""I am happy to have made it back into Q3! I think it's safe to say sometimes you do need a little bit of luck in this sport, and today it was my turn: Hamilton's lap got deleted, and that allowed me to make it into Q2. I hadn't given my best in Q1 – I was honestly pretty frustrated about it – and I knew I had to reset and focus on improving in Q2, giving everything I had: I am glad it worked out. Looking back at this morning, it was a rather uneventful Sprint from my end, although it still allowed me to get some more track time. Sprint weekends can pose some extra challenges, but also a chance to learn something more, too. Overall, I am feeling more comfortable in the car every weekend: I would like to thank the team – both trackside and back home in Hinwil - for this. Looking at tomorrow – rain or dry – we'll be ready and give it our best.""

Jonathan Wheatley, Team Principal

“The day started with the 15-lap sprint, which turned out to be a largely uneventful race overall. Unfortunately for Nico, the race did not go the way we hoped, first struggling to balance the car and, secondly, due to a combination of being overtaken and then sitting in traffic. For Gabi, he once again executed a very mature drive, starting in P10 and finishing in P9.

“The team then regrouped for qualifying and what proved to be a dramatic session here in Spa. Gabi originally qualified in P16, just 0.024 seconds off progressing into Q2. However, Hamilton's time was then deleted and Gabi found himself through to the second period of qualifying where he did a great lap, qualified P9, and put himself into Q3 for the second time this season. By Q3 we had run out of new tyres and, after two runs, he ended up qualifying in P10 for the race. It was great to see the garage busy throughout qualifying and Gabi's P10 marked Sauber's highest starting position at Spa in a decade.

""Nico, on the other hand, started off with damage in the pit lane following the incident with Stroll, which meant we had to change the nose of the car. Solid runs in Q1 got Nico into Q2 and ultimately a starting position of P14, just two tenths off getting into Q3. Sprint weekends are always a test of team endurance and once again we came together, enabling both cars to be in Q2 for the first time this season. The energy in the team is great going into Sunday and, with two good starting positions secured, we are ready for whatever surprises Spa might throw at us.”

Alpine had a torrid start to the day, with Gasly's car springing a water leak before the Sprint had even started. They tried and failed to fix that on the grid, so the Frenchman did not manage to start the Sprint. He did briefly come out three laps down to test out a few things, before retiring after a few more laps. Colapinto had started from the pit lane anyway after the team opted to change his car under parc ferme regulations – and he could not make an impact, finishing last.

Gasly's day improved slightly come Qualifying, as he made it to Q2 at least, Colapinto could not join him there though, exiting in Q1 for the second straight race.

Pierre Gasly, Sprint: DNF, Qualifying: 13th, 1:41.633

“It has been a tricky day with the Sprint Race and Qualifying. Frustratingly, the Sprint was over before it started as we had a water leak on the car on the way to the grid. The team managed to repair it so we did some laps – almost like a Free Practice 3 for us – but not anything meaningful in the end. These things happen and the team did a great job to even turn things around to have some track time. For Qualifying, everything felt quite good. We progressed through Q1 and then in Q2 the final lap was decent. We probably just needed someone in front of us for a tow but we were the first car on track so missed out. A tenth or two would have been enough to reach Q3, and we know all the little details count. We will see what we can do tomorrow. We know some teams have opted for different set-ups but we will focus on ourselves and give it everything to come away with the best possible result.”

Franco Colapinto, Sprint: 19th, Qualifying: 17th, 1:42.022

“Taking the day as a whole it has been a frustrating one, but with the work we've done as a team since yesterday, the car has improved a lot and felt like a good step forward. It felt more alive today, particularly in Qualifying but the margins are so tight that we unfortunately narrowly missed out on getting to Q2 by a tenth of a second. It's a pity as that's something you can find over a lap, but I think ultimately, we're still lacking a little bit of pace compared to the others and, with such a condensed field, it shows. Starting from the Pit Lane in the Sprint, it turned into more of a practice session for us, which gave us some useful insight and data for tomorrow. We now turn our attention to the Grand Prix tomorrow and will see what we can get out of it. With rain forecast hopefully we'll be a bit stronger and more competitive, and here at Spa anything can happen. So, we'll prepare for all eventualities.”

The two Aston Martin drivers managed to trade places in the Sprint, Stroll picking off Alonso and chasing Russell hard in the closing stages. The suspicion was that they have a much better race car than their pace in Sprint Qualifying suggested. Whether that is the case tomorrow remains to be seen, but the team will have a very tough job to show any pace from the back row of the grid. Neither Alonso nor Stroll could extract any pace whatsoever in Qualifying – the Canadian not helped by a pit lane collision with Hulkenberg which broke his endplate.

Fernando Alonso, Sprint: 14th, Qualifying: 19th, 1:42.385

""This weekend hasn't gone our way so far. We made some set-up changes for the rain, but we just lacked pace today. We need to go back and understand why our package isn't performing here. Starting near the back is never easy, and this performance doesn't reflect where we are as a team this season. I still feel quick in the car, and we'll keep pushing to see what we can do tomorrow.""

Lance Stroll, Sprint: 13th, Qualifying: 20th, 1:42.502

""We simply didn't have the pace today and qualified in P20. I'm not too surprised about the result as we've been struggling with pace all weekend. We'll look into it and see what we can learn. It looks like it's going to rain tomorrow so anything can happen.""

Andy Cowell, Team Principal

""A challenging day here in Spa. We knew heading into the Sprint it would be difficult to score points as both Lance and Fernando started further down the field. Unfortunately, the race then didn't offer any opportunities to move forward.

""In Qualifying, both cars sadly didn't make it out of Q1. While we made slight adjustments to the set-up in anticipation of rain tomorrow, fundamentally we just didn't have the pace today. With a wet race forecast, there's still a lot to play for. We'll make the most of any opportunities that come our way and fight hard to score points.""

Mario Isola, Motorsport Director

“A very busy Saturday as is always the case on a Sprint weekend. From the short race, we were able to gather plenty of useful information on how the Medium tyre, used by the great majority of drivers, behaved. Degradation was a factor, obviously as this track is very hard on tyres, but it definitely wasn't dramatic, especially as there was no graining, something we had already realised in yesterday's free practice.

“As for strategy, the first thing to take into consideration is that the forecast is for a high chance of rain. Therefore the hypothetical scenarios are many, in every sense of the word. If it's a dry race with track temperatures significantly lower than today's or yesterday's, the Soft and Medium compounds will be the most competitive.

""As there is not that big a difference between a one-stop and a two-stop, any combination of Soft and Medium is possible. That doesn't mean the decision to bring a very hard Hard here was a mistake: if we had kept the same trio as last year, the one-stop would have been significantly quicker. One must also bear in mind that overtaking at this track is not that easy, as could be seen in all today's Sprint races, in F1, F2 and F3, when trains of cars were formed despite or indeed because of the DRS. This means that the start, and especially the first sector on the opening lap, should make the difference and slipstreaming could play an important role.

“If the race starts in the dry, but with the threat of rain, one can easily imagine the Medium would be the favourite compound so as to have greater flexibility in managing the moment to switch to rain tyres or to extend the first stint as much as possible.”

ONBOARD: Lando Norris' 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the Belgian Grand Prix 

'I drove a tiny bit better' - Polesitter Norris on the small margins that made the difference in Spa Qualifying

Brad Benavides claimed his and AIX Racing's first pole position in Formula 3.

Brad Benavides earned his and AIX Racing's first pole position in FIA Formula 3 with a superb final attempt to pip Championship leader Rafael Camara to the top spot.

The American delivered a 2:04.253 as the track ramped up by a full second in the latter stages of the session to claim P1 and a memorable result for the team.

Camara recorded a time that put him on provisional pole earlier in Qualifying, but his final improvement was good enough only for second, though he was made to sweat going into the last attempt of the day.

The Scuderia Ferrari Driver Academy member's 2:04.359 was deleted for exceeding track limits, leaving him 22nd before it was reinstated ahead of the chequered flag, promoting the TRIDENT driver back into second place.

Completing the top three was Rodin Motorsport's Callum Voisin, who also took full advantage of the track improvement to go third quickest, 0.011s ahead of teammate Roman Bilinski in fourth.

Martinius Stenshorne completed the top five for Hitech TGR and led fellow McLaren Development Driver Ugo Ugochukwu, the PREMA Racing talent following in sixth.

Championship contender Nikola Tsolov wound up seventh for Campos Racing ahead of team mate Tasanapol Inthraphuvasak in P8.

Charlie Wurz, Bruno del Pino and Noah Stromsted followed, with Freddie Slater set to go from reverse grid pole after ending up 12th on his second weekend in FIA F3 this season.

'I drove a tiny bit better' - Polesitter Norris on the small margins that made the difference in Spa Qualifying

Watch the highlights as Lando Norris topped Qualifying for the Belgian Grand Prix in Spa.

Lando Norris came out on top in Qualifying for the Belgian Grand Prix, with Oscar Piastri completing a front-row lockout for McLaren.

While Max Verstappen had managed to split the McLaren drivers on Friday, he was unable to repeat the feat on Saturday, qualifying fourth - Charles Leclerc joining Norris and Piastri ahead of the four-time champion.

It was another disappointing session for Lewis Hamilton, who saw his best Q1 time deleted, which resulted in his early exit and a 16th place grid slot.

'I drove a tiny bit better' - Polesitter Norris on the small margins that made the difference in Spa Qualifying

George Russell qualified sixth for the Belgian Grand Prix after Kimi Antonelli could manage only 18th place.

George Russell admitted his concern that Mercedes had “taken a big step backwards” after another difficult qualifying session for the team at the Belgian Grand Prix.

Mercedes has struggled for pace across the Spa-Francorchamps weekend so far, with neither Russell nor Kimi Antonelli reaching the final phase of Sprint Qualifying on Friday, and both struggling to progress through the field in the Sprint itself.

While Russell's sixth place for Sunday's Grand Prix may appear a strong result on paper, the Canadian Grand Prix race winner pointed to the fine margins that defined his session.

“It was for sure, the maximum,” he said. “All of my laps were strong, but it's clear that, as a team, we've taken a big step backwards this weekend. We don't really know why.

“One tenth slower in Q1, I'd have been almost out. A tenth slower in Q3 and I'd have been P10. P6, I feel, is without doubt, the maximum we could have achieved.”

Last year, in a race Russell also started from sixth, the Briton took the chequered flag after putting on a spectacular display to make a one-stop strategy work.

Although his celebrations were halted as he was disqualified for his car being underweight, when asked if this gives him hope for this year's running, he added: “Yeah.

“I don't think it'll pan out just like last year, especially as it's wet tomorrow. But anything can happen. We'll take those positives, but as a team, we just need to assess why we had four podiums in the first six races and we've had one in the last six races.”

Rookie Antonelli has also found himself enduring a recent run of a bad form, with a third place in Canada his only points score in the last six races. Indeed, he is yet to score a point on European soil.

An error in Sprint Qualifying left him at the back of Saturday's grid, but the Italian had no such excuse on Qualifying for the Grand Prix, as he set the third slowest time, with only the two Aston Martins behind him.

“It's just a difficult period,” he conceded. “I just need to get out of this and try to improve for the next one.”

“The confidence has been missing. Definitely, I struggled to have the same feeling as yesterday, for example, and I just really need to find the light at the end of the tunnel again.”

Outside of 'Deadpool & Wolverine,' the reboot looks to score the best domestic opening for Kevin Feige's superhero studio since 2022's 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.'  


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	Mister Fantastic and his family have cleared the launch pad in high style.


	Director Matt Shakman‘s Fantastic Four: First Steps topped Friday's box office chart in North America with a huge $57 million, ahead of tracking and putting it on course for a franchise-best debut in the $120 million-$125 million range in a seminal win for Kevin Feige‘s Marvel Studios (rivals are betting on the higher end). And it's already crossed the $100 million mark globally after earning $49.2 million in its first few days overseas for an early worldwide tally of $106.2 million through Friday.

					Box Office: James Gunn's 'Superman' Is Not Flying as High Overseas		
			









	The acclaimed superhero pic boasts the second-biggest opening day of the year to date domestically behind A Minecraft Movie ($57.1 million). That included $24.4 million in Thursday previews, which was the best preview gross of the year to date after supplanting DC's Superman ($22.5 million), and the biggest preview number for any movie since fellow Marvel title Deadpool & Wolverine a year ago ($38.5 million). 


	The early performance of First Steps, which is winning over critics and audiences, is welcome news for the Disney-owned Marvel, where Feige and his team are looking for redemption after a rough few years (Deadpool & Wolverine being the exception). If projections hold — and again, besides Deadpool 3 — the Fantastic Four reboot will mark the best domestic opening for Marvel since 2022's Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. And so far, the movie is pacing slightly head of Superman.


	Also on Friday, Disney became the first Hollywood studio to cross $3 billion in global ticket sales. 

	











Superman debuted to a successful $125 million domestically two weeks ago and $95 million overseas, where it is coming in behind expectations due to the pro-American themes long tied to the comic-book character. Fantastic Four should have an upper hand over Superman overseas internationally, considering that the previous films in the franchise made by 20th Century Fox did more of their business offshore.


	The New York City-set First Steps, which is earning raves for its early 1960s retro-style, stars Pedro Pascal as scientific genius Reed Richards, who leads a space expedition with his wife, Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby); her brother, Johnny Storm (Joseph Quinn); and piloted by their good friend Ben Grimm (Ebon Moss-Bachrach). When their rocket ship encounters a cosmic storm, it alters their DNA, returning them to Earth with superpowers.


	The new film picks up after the four have returned and have become become worldwide heroes. But there is no time to rest on their laurels. They must return to space when Earth is visited by the Silver Surfer (Julia Garner), who warns that the planet is about to be destroyed by a cosmic entity named Galactus.


	In terms of the box office, the hope is that Fantastic Four will play to both families and fanboys/fangirls alike, which should help combat lingering superhero fatigue at the box office. It's earning glowing responses from moviegoers, including an A- CinemaScore, stellar exits on PostTrak and a 93 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. Reviewers are responding much the same. “The pleasing back-to-basics feel in The Fantastic Four: First Steps suggests Marvel has learned valuable lessons from its recent box office underperformers. There's a fresh willingness to prioritize character over the usual barrage of interchangeable CG action sequences that often overwhelm them, instead giving us relatable folks to invest in,” Hollywood Reporter chief film critic David Rooney writes in his review. “The eponymous quartet may have superpowers, but they are also a family, struggling like most of us to handle the most daunting responsibilities life throws our way.”

	











	Elsewhere, Superman is holding in nicely even as it loses Imax screens to Fantastic Four. The DC and Warner Bros. pic should finish its third weekend with nearly $300 million in domestic ticket sales and north of $500 million globally. 


	Universal and Amblin's Jurassic World: Rebirth is also celebrating. It will cross $300 million domestically this weekend after clearing $600 million globally a week ago.

Trained on the New York stage — she worked with Cicely Tyson in ‘The Blacks' — she also played Victoria Butterfield, one of Bea Arthur's maids, on ‘Maude.'


							By 

	Mike Barnes


Senior Editor


	Marlene Warfield, the New York actress known for her feisty turns as the prostitute ex-girlfriend of James Earl Jones' boxer in The Great White Hope on Broadway and the big screen and as a young revolutionary in Network, has died. She was 83.


	Warfield died April 6 of lung cancer at a hospital in Los Angeles, her sister, Chequita Warfield, told The Hollywood Reporter.




	Warfield also recurred as Maude's third and last regular housekeeper, the Jamaica-born Victoria Butterfield, on the sixth and final season (1977-78) of the famed Norman Lear-created CBS sitcom that starred Bea Arthur.

	After appearing in the East Village at St. Mark's Playhouse in French dramatist Jean Genet's The Blacks — where she understudied for Cicely Tyson and also worked alongside the likes of Jones, Godfrey Cambridge and Maya Angelou — Warfield made it to Broadway in October 1968 when she was cast as Clara in The Great White Hope, written by Howard Sackler.


	She received Theatre World and Clarence Derwent prizes for her powerful performance, then accompanied Tony winners Jones and Jane Alexander to Hollywood, where all three reprised their roles in the 1970 film directed by Martin Ritt at 20th Century Fox.


	In Paddy Chayefsky and Sidney Lumet's Network (1976), nominated for best picture, Warfield sparkled in a scene in which her Laureen Hobbs, an Angela Davis type, meets with Faye Dunaway's Diana Christensen, a UBS executive who wants to do a weekly series revolving around the Ecumenical Liberation Army.


	After Diana introduces herself as a “racist lackey of the imperialist ruling circles,” Hobbs introduces herself as “a bad-ass Commie nigger.”

	











	The second of the three kids, Marlene Ronetta Warfield was born in Queens on June 19, 1941, and raised in Brooklyn. His father, Sidney, sold tokens for the New York City Transit Authority, and her mother, Ruth, was a homemaker.


	Warfield took tap, ballet and acrobatic lessons as a kid, and while attending the High School of Performing Arts in Manhattan did summer stock, appearing in a 1957 production of Take a Giant Step in the Catskills.


	Later, she studied opera at the Brooklyn Conservatory of Music and acting at the American Institute of Theater and TV Arts.


	She replaced Thelma Oliver in The Blacks in 1962 and worked onstage in A Matter of Life and Death, Elektra, Volpone, Who's Got His Own and The Taming of the Shrew at Lincoln Center before landing on The Great White Hope.


	Around this time, she also was showing up on such TV shows as The Nurses, The Defenders, For the People and Dave Garroway's Wide Wide World and doing commercials for Fab detergent.


	Represented by pioneering Black talent agent Ernestine McClendon, Warfield moved to California in 1977 to join the cast of Maude, on which she made her first appearance late in the fifth season. She succeeded Esther Rolle (as Florida Evans) and Hermione Baddeley (as Nell Naugatuck) as maids in the suburban Findlay household.


	Her Victoria Butterfield was “not stupid, she is not uneducated, she's very ambitious and stands on her own two feet,” Warfield told Jet magazine in August 1977.

	











	Warfield's résumé also included the films Joe (1970), Across 110th Street (1972) and Richard Pryor's Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling (1986) and guest spots on such TV series as The Name of the Game, Lou Grant, The Jeffersons, Little House on the Prairie, Hill Street Blues, Cagney & Lacey, In the House, ER, The West Wing, The Shield, Law & Order and Cold Case.


	In 2000, she returned to the stage in Pittsburgh for a starring role in August Wilson's King Hedley II.


	In addition to her sister, survivors include her son, Keith; her grandson, Demetrius; and a cousin, percussionist Vivian Warfield. She was married to William Horsey from 1967 until his 1993 death. Her brother, Earl, died in January 2024.

Upstart genre company Panick Entertainment will publish the title next year.


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


David Dastmalchian is continuing his budding career as a comics author with a brand new horror title for upstart publisher Panick Entertainment.


	The actor, who can currently be seen in The Life of Chuck as well as Dexter: Resurrection, is working on The Accessories, a five-issue mini-series that he co-created and is co-writing with longtime creative associate Leah Kirkpatrick. The comic and details will be unveiled at Dastmalchian's Saturday panel at San Diego Comic-Con.




	Patrick Piazzalunga is illustrating the books which Panick will publish next year. Panick is the horror and science fiction venture that launched last year and was founded by a cadre of entertainment and comics industry veterans, including several from the world of DC.

	Accessories focuses on the classic side characters that have supported some of horrordom's most vile villains — Igor, the assistant to many mad scientists; Renfield, the lackey to Dracula; and Mrs. Hyde, the wife of dual personality-challenged Dr. Jeckyll/Mr. Hyde.


	The logline and premise reads:


After lifetimes in the background, three of history's greatest horror sidekicks finally say what they've never dared to before: Enough is enough!


Igor, Renfield and Mrs. Hyde have aided their masters' diabolical missions for decades but today is the day they stop being loyal. Today the real horror walks out the front door. The looming question is…what do they do now? These three discarded servants find each other in the fallout, forming a band of gawky but determined anti-heroes caught between angry villagers, vengeful monster-hunters and furious former employers. Their survival will take more than just guts, luckily, they know where to procure more.












In a darkly comic descent into revenge and rebirth, the hench finally claim the title they never asked for…The Accessories!!


	Dastmalchian has built a notable career working with directors such as James Gunn, Christopher Nolan and Denis Villeneuve, with many of their movies falling directly into the geek sphere bullseye. And he next shoots the villain role of Mr. Bison in video game adaptation Street Fighter.


	But he is also birthing a body of comic writing work. Among the highlights is his horror creation Count Crowley, which is published by Dark Horse.


	Panick is focused on genre storytelling, beginning in the field of comics and graphic novels, and then aims to platform that into films, television, games and other media. So Accessories has plans beyond the printed page.


	The first issue is due to hit shelves on June 2, 2026. Check out the first look below.

Currently airing its fourth season, the sci-fi series' creatives tell The Hollywood Reporter how it feels to have the show come to an end next month.


							By 

	Ryan Gajewski


Senior Entertainment Reporter


	The team behind Resident Alien is still coming to terms with the sci-fi show's end after its cancellation was revealed midway through season four.


	Ahead of Resident Alien's season four finale airing Aug. 8 on USA Network and Syfy, The Hollywood Reporter confirmed on Thursday that the series has been canceled. Alan Tudyk, Sara Tomko, Corey Reynolds and Alice Wetterlund are among the stars of the project that centers on Harry (Tudyk), an alien who lands on Earth and assumes the identity of a small-town doctor while developing a fondness for mankind.

	“It is bittersweet,” Reynolds tells THR during a video interview with the show's team from San Diego Comic-Con. “We're all grateful for the opportunity. With what we know about what's coming in the storytelling [in] these last three episodes, it creates the perfect environment for someone to come in and watch our show from top to bottom and get a full meal, the whole thing.”


	The actor known for playing Sheriff Mike continues, “When you love something, you never want to let it go. All of us bring a tremendous amount of love for this project, for the people we work with, for the people we work for. And so it's always hard to let go of that. It is tough. I wasn't ready. I'm still not ready.”


	Series creator Chris Sheridan explains to THR that he had seen “the writing on the wall” ahead of working on season four and had a feeling this would be the program's final run.

	











	“When myself and the rest of the writers were arcing out the season, we had that in mind,” he says. “We wanted to give the show an ending. So coming into the season, I told the actors, ‘I think this is probably the last season, so let's appreciate it.'” 


	Sheridan reveals that the team experienced “special, sad days” while making season four with the assumption that the show would be saying goodbye. “To see that possibly go away, to feel that was difficult,” he adds. “But also, it was way better than being at home after the season and getting a call, and that stuff you love is gone. We were able to grieve with each other for a year and live through it.”

“We think of you all the time when we are in the writers room and we always talk about what would the fans want and love,” exec producer Akiva Goldsman told supporters in Hall H. 


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


Star Trek: Strange New Worlds boldly went exactly where fans wanted them to go with its San Diego Comic-Con panel, delivering a fun presentation that also gave the 6,500-strong crowd in the cavernous Hall H one thing that geeks most: seeing something before anyone else.


	Fandom has always been an important aspect of Trek — the original show famously became a cultural force long after it went off the air after being canceled — and the showrunners made a point to give a nod to the fans.




	“We think of you all the time when we are in the writers room and we always talk about what would the fans want and love,” said exec producer Akiva Goldsman.

	The ensuing banter with the cast led to a Trekkie's delight, a screening of the fourth episode of Strange New Worlds current third season, which doesn't hit Paramount+ until next week. And it was one that was tailor-made for fans.


	Titled “A Spaced Adventure Hour,” the episode was a period murder mystery. But that belied all the callbacks that made what was shown resonate. The setting is 1969 Hollywood with the suspects all being actors and makers of a sci-fi series, one that just got canceled, and one that bears a massive resemblance to the original Trek. Strange New Worlds actor Paul Wesley even plays a Captain Kirk-type of character in a funny recreation of the show within the show, and a star with a massive but fragile ego off-screen


	Also resonating to the Hall H crowd was a speech by Celia Rose Gooding who, in the murder mystery, plays a Hollywood agent who has a monologue about how important of an impact a sci-fi show could have on the world and on making someone watching it feel seen and included.

	











	“I've been acting for 25 years and that was the most fun I've ever had shooting anything,” Wesley said on stage after the episode screened. “I'm trying to do everytihng I can to pay respect and homage to what William Shatner created.”


	“I wonder if he'll see it,” asked Jess Bush, who plays Nurse Chapel, standing on stage with Wesley.


	“I hope so,” the actor said, quipping, “I'll DM it to him.”


	Lead Anson Mount, who plays Captain Pike on the series, wasn't on stage as it was revealed his wife had recently given birth to a baby daughter, Violet. However, in a very short video, Mount made an appearance… sitting in the Enterprise's captain's chair in puppet form. Thus it was teased that in the fourth season, there will be an all-puppet episode, continuing the show's playing around with form, genres and conventions.


	Jim Henson's Creature Shop will be supplying the puppet work for the episode which is being directed by Jordan Canning (Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock). Watch the teaser below.


	The panel also featured the release of a trailer for the audio series Star Trek: Kahn and the first teaser trailer for Star Trek: Starfleet Academy. Based on the reactions of Hall H, the latter showed that the producers will have to work on building enthusiasm for what essentially introduces a crop of new and young characters into the Trek universe. Starfleet Academy is due to premiere in 2026.

Lasers, Nine Inch Nails and light cycles all dominated during the film's Comic-Con debut.

	Before Jeff Bridges got to the set of Tron: Ares, he was informed that his co-star Jared Leto would prefer to be addressed by his character, Ares. The Oscar-winner is known for his method acting ways.


	“He's one of those guys. Everyone has different methods and modes man,” said Bridges to laughs during Tron: Ares' laser-heavy presentation at San Diego Comic-Con Friday.




	“I didn't want to offend him as a thespo,” Bridges continued, addressing Leto, who is known as a method actor. “But I thought, ‘I wanted to have a certain intimacy with you. I know your name is Ares. Can I just call you Air?' He said, ‘Yeah man! You can call me whatever you want!' We had a great time.”

	Leto, for his part, recalled the first scene he had with Bridges. “I just blurted out, ‘cut!' Everyone was surprised, because I don't often do that. The first AD comes over and said, ‘Is everything OK? What's wrong?' And I said, ‘You know, I just can't stop smiling, because I'm working with my guy.'”

Tron: Ares, from director Joachim Rønning, arrives Oct. 10 and unlike the original films, in which our heroes enter the digital world known as the Grid, this film has programs from the Grid arriving in the real world. It is a big swing for Disney, as while the 1982 original Tron became a cult classic, it was not a hit. Neither was 2010 sequel Tron: Legacy. Still, the property, created by writer-director Steven Lisberger, has endured. “My feeling about Tron is the most important thing is we kick this technology around artistically before it kicks us around,” said Lisberger to applause.

	











	The Tron films have been known for their unique scores, with Daft Punk's work on Tron: Legacy now considered a classic. Nine Inch Nails stepped into the role for Ares, but moderator Kevin Smith jokingly asked why Leto wasn't involved in the score.


	“You guys didn't think to reach out to, Jared? I hear he likes music as well,” Smith said to laughs, referencing Leto's career as the frontman of rock band 30 Seconds to Mars.


	Leto, who spent years developing the project as a star and producer, gave credit to the Daft Punk score from 15 years ago.


	“When we were talking about music for this film, there was really very few people you could think about that could fill those shoes. Nine Inch Nails absolutely did it. They made music that will last a lifetime,” said Leto.


	Indeed, the Tron: Ares panel suggests that the score will live up to the legacy, with lengthy, effects-heavy clips to the film backed by Nine Inch Nails impressing the crowd.


	There were plenty of moments of comedy during the panel, with Bridges in full “The Dude” mode, harkening back to his The Big Lebowski Character. “The Grid abides,” Smith said at one point, with Bridges agreeing, “The Grid abides.”


	Between Smith and Bridges, pretty much everyone on the panel was addressed as, “man,” multiple times, including co-star Greta Lee.


	At another point, Smith made a reference to star Lee's acclaimed romantic drama Past Lives, joking the script to Ares must have reminded her of that film.

	











	Lee, who is new to Comic-Con and was surprised the Past Lives joke landed for that crowd, said “I told my agents just find something where I can ride a light cycle.” Which, as the audience in Hall H saw, she does indeed do in the new movie.

The Live '25 tour rolled into London and saw the group on red-hot form.


													By
												

	Thomas Smith



Oasis and Wembley Stadium go way back. The iconic football stadium in northwest London is, for many, the pinnacle of an artist's career. Everyone from Taylor Swift to Michael Jackson have dominated the 90,000-capacity ground. Come late August, Coldplay will hold the record with 16 sold-out shows.


	Back in 2000 the Gallagher brothers swaggered Wembley Way for their maiden appearance — but Liam was distinctly unimpressed. “If you think I'm over the moon to be here, then you must be trippin,'” he said on the second of their two-night stand, later calling it a “s—t hole.” This was prior to the stadium's renovation, and the band returned in 2009 on their final tour.


	But that 2000 show — dubbed one of their most “disastrous” shows — still lives long in the memory. It was immortalised on the Familiar to Millions live LP and broadcast live on U.K. television. The show included instances of LG mouthing off about his divorce (“I don't even have a f—g teabag to my name”) and whatever substances were rattling around the dressing room (“I'm in one of them moods,” he warned). The performance itself was sloppy and languid compared to their previous highs at Maine Road and Knebworth in 1996.


	A quarter of a century later, the vibes could not be more different. The band's Live ‘25 tour — which has so far visited Cardiff and Manchester — has seen them on red-hot form: Liam's vocals are on top notch, Noel and the rest of the band's playing is as unified as its been for decades and, thus far, no dramas from the pair. They're sounding crisper and more energised as the tour rolls on, and the U.K. public are properly mad fer it, as they dominate the Albums Chart once more and the populus proudly sport Oasis-branded clobber.


	These were the best moments from Oasis' opening night on Friday (July 25) at Wembley Stadium on the band's Live ‘25 reunion tour.


	Over the years, “Acquiesce” has only grown in stature. The 1995 song was a B-Side to “Some Might Say,” their first U.K. No. 1 single, and became a firm fixture in their live sets. Over the decades it has become utterly beloved and the shared vocals between Noel and Liam sum up their messy love-hate relationship: “Because we need each other/ We believe in one another.” Before the second chorus, Noel gave a little hand wave to encourage the audience to sing louder than they ever had before — they obliged, of course.


	The tour's kick-off in Cardiff earlier this month (July 5) had an air of mystery — and tightness, perhaps. Now the boys are feeling comfortable back on stage together, arriving on stage arm-in-arm again, and chatting with the audience just like old times. “I seem to get myself in a lot of trouble these days,” Liam said, perhaps referencing his quip about the Coldplay kiss cam scandal earlier this week. Before “Don't Look Back in Anger” Noel paid tribute to his favourite boozer The Chiltern Firehouse in London, which suffered a fire earlier this year, and dedicated the song to all the barmaids. We weren't getting this level of chat on opening night.


	Mockingly dubbed “the hokey-cokey” by Liam, the crowd performing the “Poznan” has become a highlight of the Live ‘25 reunion tour. The celebration adopted by their beloved soccer team Man City involves facing away from the stage, linking arms and bouncing up and down in unison. It made for a bizarre but brilliant sight as the T Rex-aping riff kicked into gear — and even won over fans of some of City's biggest rivals.


	Their 2002 LP Heathen Chemistry isn't quite considered a classic, but it does pack bursts of greatness and some of their best post-90s material. “Little by Little” is one such song, a bitter, furious ballad that brought to a close Noel's section in the middle of the set (alongside “Talk Tonight” and “Half the World Away”) and gave one last look in daylight as the sun set on the Wembley crowd. “Stand By Me,” which featured on a bank advert in the U.K. in recent years, was sung (and screamed) with similar gusto.


	The group's Live ‘25 tour dates thus far have been opened by Britpop band Cast, and Richard Ashcroft formerly of the Verve. The latter served as the inspiration for “Cast No Shadow” from 1995's (What's The Story) Morning Glory?, and paints a picture of a man caught in the wrong time and place but stumbling through life against the tide of adversity. Ashcroft's peaks as a songwriter in the ‘90s were as high as Gallagher's (“Bittersweet Symphony” and “Sonnet”), and it's only right that he's in the room to witness the outpouring of love for a song written in his honour.


	Few rocked harder than the late Ozzy Osbourne — and Liam and Noel know that. During “Live Forever,” the band paid tribute to the Black Sabbath singer who died on July 22, aged 76, by placing an image of him on screen during the song's outro. The following song “Rock'n'Roll Star” was dedicated by Liam to the Prince of Darkness, too.


	The band's 1995 song is something of a parody of itself — how can a song like that get so big and still remain sincere? Even Liam acknowledged it as he jokingly introduced it as “that wretched song.” The crowd didn't seem to mind, and when Liam stepped away from the mic during the chorus to let the audience sing the words it sent chills through the body.

""Astronomer has gotten a lot of questions over the last few days,"" the actress — and Chris Martin's ex — says in the ad.


													By
												

	Mitchell Peters



Gwyneth Paltrow is stepping in — temporarily — to help clear the air about Astronomer.


	On Friday (July 25), the Academy Award-winning actress and Goop founder appeared in a humorous new video for the tech company. The ad follows a viral incident involving former CEO Andy Byron and HR executive Kristin Cabot, who were caught on a Coldplay kiss cam during the band's Boston concert earlier this month.


	Shortly after Cabot's resignation on Friday, Astronomer shared a social media video starring Paltrow — who was married to Coldplay frontman Chris Martin from 2003 to 2016 — acting as the company's “temporary spokesperson” on behalf of its employees.

	











	“Thank you for your interest in Astronomer,” Paltrow says in the video, seated casually at a desk. “I've been hired on a very temporary basis to speak on behalf of the 300-plus employees at Astronomer. Astronomer has gotten a lot of questions over the last few days, and they wanted me to answer the most common ones.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	As questions flash on-screen — including “OMG! What the actual f—” and “How is your social media team hold-” — Paltrow offers responses that hilariously sidestep the actual drama.


	“Yes, Astronomer is the best place to run Apache Airflow, unifying the experience of running data, ML and AI pipelines at scale,” she says cheerfully after the first inquiry. “We've been thrilled so many people have a newfound interest in data workflow automation.”


	When the second question begins being typed out on screen, appears the Shakespeare in Love star shifts gears again, plugging the company's upcoming Beyond Analytics event in September.

	











	“We will now be returning to what we do best, which is delivering game-changing results for our customers,” Paltrow concludes. “Thank you for your interest in Astronomer.”


	The ad arrives in the wake of the July 15 Coldplay concert at Boston's Gillette Stadium, where a jumbotron caught Byron with his arm around Cabot during a kiss cam segment. When the pair realized they were on screen, Byron ducked out of view while Cabot quickly turned away. Both were married to other people at the time and have since resigned from the company.


	“Oh, look at these two,” Martin joked from the stage. “Oh, what? Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy.”

The disgraced singer was held liable by default in the case.


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



Justin Sane, the former lead singer of defunct political punk band Anti-Flag, has been ordered to pay $1.9 million to a woman he's accused of raping in 2010.


	A Tuesday (July 22) federal court order holds Sane (born Justin Geever) liable by default because he's failed to respond to the assault and sexual battery lawsuit brought in 2023 by a woman named Kristina Sarhadi.


	Sarhadi alleges Sane strangled and raped her at a motel in 2010, after they met at an Anti-Flag show at The Bell House in Brooklyn. She was the first of a dozen women to come forward with sexual misconduct claims against Sarhadi in July 2023, causing the avowedly “straight-edge,” pro-feminism band Anti-Flag to split up after 35 years.


	Sane denied Sarhadi's claims as “categorically false” back in 2023, but he never took any action in the lawsuit. Judge Brenda K. Sannes has therefore entered default judgment against Sane, a legal outcome where defendants are found to have effectively admitted to the claims against them by failing to respond despite repeated warnings.


	The Tuesday order requires Sane to pay Sarhadi $1.9 million in damages, including $750,000 for pain and suffering and $420,800 for the costs of therapy to address post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety stemming from the 2010 rape.


	“It is well-documented through the supporting affidavits that plaintiff has suffered extreme emotional distress and a complete upending of her life, as evidenced by her symptoms which have persisted fifteen years since the date of the attack,” writes Judge Sannes.


	The damages figure also includes $750,000 in punitive damages, which a judge can institute to punish or deter a defendant for behavior that's beyond the pale.


	“The sexual violence committed by the defendant undeniably constitutes morally reprehensible or utterly reckless behavior making a punitive damage award proper,” writes the judge. “Defendant sexually assaulted plaintiff and shattered her emotional well-being, causing life-long ramifications years after the attack.”


	“Defendant's conduct is even more morally reprehensible because he used his fame and status to lure a much younger fan into his hotel room under false pretenses,” adds Judge Sannes.


	Sane could not be reached for comment on Friday (July 25). Sarhadi's attorney did not return a request for comment on the judgment.


	Sarhadi's lawsuit originally alleged that the other former members of Anti-Flag — Chris Head, Chris Barker and Pat Thetic — should have known about Sane's repeated sexual misconduct but failed to put a stop to it. But Judge Sannes dismissed Sarhadi's claims against Anti-Flag's corporate entity, Hardwork Distribution Inc., this past December after finding that she had not adequately pled negligence on the band's part.


Stuart Slotnick, a lawyer representing Head, Barker and Thetic, told Billboard on Friday that his clients “have had no contact with Geever at all (nor do they wish to)” since the sexual assault allegations came to light.


	“They were shocked to hear the complaints,” Slotnick says. “We were very happy that the judge recognized that the three former members of the band had nothing to do with Geever or his misdeeds.”

					By Baz Bamigboye 

Columnist/International Editor At Large


EXCLUSIVE: Gurinder Chadha reveals to Deadline that a sequel to her celebrated 2002 film Bend It Like Beckham, which starred Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley, is officially in the works. “I'm excited to revisit the original characters and revive the enduring story and build on the legacy we helped to create for the women's game,” the London-based director confirms.


	Chadha adds that Nagra, Knightley, Archie Punjabi, Juliet Stevenson and other members of the original cast “are aware that a sequel is being developed, but they obviously want to see a script before they commit.

	“I'm pretty certain that everyone's going to want to come back,” she adds hopefully.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“Everything hinges on the script and if the original cast likes it,” Chadha says. “I am working really hard to make sure every character I bring back has a decent arc and scenes.”


	The filmmaker was in Basel, Switzerland, ahead of tomorrow's Women's European Championship final where England women's soccer team faces Spain — a repeat of their 2023 World Cup clash — she tells us that for 23 years “I didn't want to do anything because I didn't have a story. And then I came up with a great story, really super-cool story. So now I'm inspired. Literally came up with it just about a month ago. It's my very clear wish to bring the characters back very,very soon.Women's football is more competitive ,more exciting, and more global than ever.It is an honor for me to be a small part of it.”


	Chadha has been toying around with the prospect of a follow-up feature or television drama for two years, encouraged by the phenomenal increase in worldwide support for women's football.


	The aim, Chadha says, is to have the sequel ready by 2027 to mark the 25th anniversary of Bend it Like Beckham's 2002 UK opening. It's a key year for the game, with the FIFA Women's World Cup tournament set to kick off in host nation Brazil from June 24-July 25 that year.

	











	The original film was based on a screenplay she co-wrote with Guljit Bindra and her husband Paul Mayeda Berges.


	Chadha and Berges have begun discussing the screenwriting process. “I'm hoping to write it with Paul, who has come up with some very funny lines like he did last time.”


	During this year's Cannes Film Festival, Chadha was introduced to Emma Hayes, who took over as head coach of the U.S. women's national soccer team in June. They subsequently met and chatted a few times and are now working “collaboratively” on the sequel. “Her insights into the world of football at her level are invaluable,” Chadha explains.


	Hayes says that Bend it Like Beckham has had a “massive impact” on her life. “I was Keira Knightley in Bend it. I cried in the cinema watching the film because I felt just like Jess and Jules,” the characters Nagra and Knightley played in the movie.


	”There was no hope for women's football in Britain then so I was going to the States to try my luck. Twenty three years ago I could never have dreamed of how much that film changed the women's game and now I have the best job in the world- head coach of the U.S. Women's national team,” Hayes notes. The top sportswoman adds that she's happy to be  “helping Gurinder with all my experience and insight into the game.”




	The project also has won support from Lisa Nandy MP, Britain's Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, who lauds Bend It Like Beckham for capturing “something so special about Britain — our spirit, our diversity, and our ability to dream big in the face of challenge.”


	Nandy adds that Chadha's story “resonated far beyond the screen and became part of our cultural DNA.”


	The Cabinet member's statement notes that the announcement “of a sequel is a brilliant moment for British film. It builds on a legacy that continues to inspire and shows the world what British storytelling can do. Films like this help tell our national story, remind us who we are, and who we can be.”


	Indeed the film has become a cultural touchstone over the years, with many of the leading lights in the world of women's soccer proclaiming Bend It Like Beckham as their main source of inspiration back in the day when the amateur antics of women playing soccer were laughed at. Since then the sport has become huge, with millions following professional women's clubs and national teams around the world.


	Chadha smiles ruefully as she recounts how with the first film she “couldn't even get arrested making it. Everyone was like, ‘We're not interested. Who wants to see a film about girls playing football?' Everyone laughed me out of the rooms.”


	For her, the original film “was about lifting up girls and saying, ‘You can do and you can be anything you want even though society dictates what you can and can't do,' and that message is still relevant today, even though we have women and women's soccer sides so huge around the world. The film's been part of that legacy, and I feel there's more that I can do. So that's what I'm writing and that's what I'm focusing on. It will be hard-hitting, of course, but it will also be incredibly joyous.


	“Let's hope we can bring back that same joy and feel good about putting women and girls on the map like we did 23 years ago.”

	











	In Bend It Like Beckham, Nagra plays Jasminder, a teenager besotted with soccer sensation David Beckham — then a player with Manchester United and the England men's squad — who is determined to play soccer against the wishes of her parents. Knightley plays her friend Jules, who also likes to land the ball at the back of the net. 


	Jonathan Rhys Meyers was cast as the fictional Hounslow Harriers team manager. 


	Chadha's latest film Christmas Karma starring Eva Longoria, Kunal Nayyar, Hugh Bonneville Charithra Chandran and Danny Dyer, will be released by True Brit Entertainment in UK and Ireland on November 14. Negotiations for other territories including the U.S., Australia and India are being finalized.

	Although Heathers (1988) has gone down as a cult classic over the past four decades, it was a career liability for star Winona Ryder after its release.


	The 2x Oscar nominee recently revealed the Michael Lehmann-directed teen dark comedy cost her a role alongside Marlon Brando and Matthew Broderick in the 1990 crime comedy The Freshman.


	“I was told I was never gonna work again if I did Heathers. I did lose a job,” she told Elle UK, hesitating to reveal the part she lost. “OK, OK, I'll tell you. You remember the movie The Freshman?”

	Ryder explained, “They thought it was making fun of teen suicide. They were deeply offended and, yeah, they revoked the offer. I'm like, ‘I can't work with Marlon Brando?' But I had to stand my ground. I wasn't gonna apologise.”

	











	In Heathers, Ryder stars as the formerly unpopular Veronica, who joins the titular clique of mean girls, which includes Heather Chandler (Kim Walker), Heather McNamara (Lisanne Falk) and Heather Duke (Shannen Doherty). When she meets mysterious new kid JD (Christian Slater), they begin killing off the Heathers and staging deaths as suicides.


	Although the movie was considered a flop at the time, grossing $1.1 million worldwide as it was met with backlash over the satirical approach to suicide, Heathers has found a cult following over the years, inspiring an off-Broadway musical and a short-lived 2016 TV reboot that was quickly cancelled after it was met with similar criticism as its source material.


	Ryder previously recalled that her agent begged her not to take the role in Heathers, which was penned by Daniel Waters.

	Six years after his onscreen son died, Adam Sandler paid tribute to Cameron Boyce with his latest movie.


	With Happy Gilmore 2 now available to stream on Netflix, eagle-eyed viewers have noticed Sandler's Grown Ups co-star appearing on a TV in the background of one scene, following the young actor's death at age 20 in 2019.


	“Adam put a tiny Cameron Boyce (played his son in Grown Ups) tribute in Happy Gilmore 2. Excuse me while I sob,” wrote one viewer on X, sharing an image of the scene with what appears to be Boyce in an episode of Disney Channel's Jessie playing on a TV.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Sandler's 2020 Netflix comedy Hubie Halloween featured a tribute to Boyce, who was supposed to appear in the film before he died.

	











	“In loving memory of CAMERON BOYCE,” the tribute read. “Gone way too soon and one of the kindest, coolest, funniest, and most talented kids we knew. You live on forever in our hearts and are truly missed every day.”

	Boyce — who was also known for his roles in Descendants, Jessie and Mrs. Fletcher — died in his sleep on July 6, 2019. His family noted at the time that his death was caused by “an ongoing medical condition,” which was later revealed to be epilepsy.


	“It is with a profoundly heavy heart that we report that this morning we lost Cameron,” a family rep said in a statement. “He passed away in his sleep due to a seizure which was a result of an ongoing medical condition for which he was being treated. The world is now undoubtedly without one of its brightest lights, but his spirit will live on through the kindness and compassion of all who knew and loved him.


	“We are utterly heartbroken and ask for privacy during this immensely difficult time as we grieve the loss of our precious son and brother,” they added.


	Boyce's family started the Cameron Boyce Foundation in his honor, aiming to cure epilepsy by funding research, education and awareness campaigns.

I am sorry to those who didn't like the new film. As a fan of the original & a golf/sports fan, I rather enjoyed it. I supposed a lot of the jokes would go begging by some because they don't understand the references. But, if you enter with lowered expectations, you will come out with a smile.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Dave Letterman tears into ""gutless"" CBS over Colbert cancellation","https://www.avclub.com/dave-letterman-attacks-gutless-cbs-colbert-cancellation","Sat, 26 Jul 2025 02:50:00 GMT","

Dave Letterman has never been shy about letting TV network management know when they're being idiots, assholes, or any other flavor of pinhead. (Indeed, at least part of the man's mystique, as he himself would note, runs on his love of battling with and tweaking his various corporate overlords over the years.) So it's not entirely shocking to hear Letterman go hard after CBS over its recent conduct vis a vis his successor Stephen Colbert, calling the decision to cancel Colbert's Late Show last week both “gutless” and an act of “pure cowardice.”

﻿

Letterman was in conversation with his long-time friend and collaborator, Late Show executive producer Barbara Gaines, as well as My Next Guest Needs No Introduction executive producer Mary Barclay, when he launched enthusiastically into the topic. Laying out his own (slightly idiosyncratic) view of events—he remains convinced, against all evidence, Barclay's protests, and in the service of comedy, that Skydance Media is run by twin brothers—Letterman says he doesn't buy that CBS's decision to tell Colbert his current season will be his last was financially motivated. “You're telling me losing this kind of money happened yesterday?” he rhetorically asks, noting, with agreement from veteran producer Gaines, that there are plenty of ways late night shows can tighten budgets before going to the nuclear option. In Letterman's view, the timing is just too obvious: Skydance (which just got FCC approval for its merger with Paramount, which is set to conclude early next month) didn't want a repeat of what went down with Donald Trump's CBS News lawsuit, and so pre-emptively got rid of Colbert before he could continue to deploy his “precise, quick, witty” satirical abilities on Trump's hide.

Hilariously, Letterman actually sounds just a tad jealous of Colbert for being dropped into such a clear and obvious hero position, noting that he's “a martyr” who's basically had his position in the TV Hall Of Fame permanently set. (“I only wish this has happened to me,” Letterman says at one point, only half-sounding like he was joking. “This would have been so great for me.”) All told, it's a withering takedown of the “bottom feeders” Letterman condemns at Skydance (delivering a classically Letterman “What the fuck is Skydance? Is it a discount airline?” in the process).

The members of prolific Australian rock band King Gizzard And The Wizard Lizard announced this afternoon that they were pulling their music from Spotify, specifically citing the actions and investments of streaming service CEO Daniel Ek. Writing that Ek “invests millions in AI military drone technology,” the band announced on Instagram that “We just removed our music from the platform. Can we put pressure on these Dr. Evil tech bros to do better? Join us on another platform.”

The group is the latest band to pull their music from the service over Ek, and specifically his Prima Materia investment fund, which recently raised more than $600 million in funding for military drone developer Helsing. (Ek is also chairman of Helsing, which started as an AI software developer before moving into creating and manufacturing its own drones.) Previously, bands Deerhoof and Bay Area indie band Xiu Xiu announced they were making similar moves to pull their music from the service. (Xiu Xiu's statement on their own decision, which they announced yesterday, goes even harder than King Gizzard's, with the band writing that “Although the financial practices of all streaming services is acutely anti-musician, the actions of Spotify to use the profits they made from essentially stealing music in order to murder people to make even more money is almost beyond comprehension.”)

King Gizzard actually made two announcements on social media today, also announcing that they were releasing a new collection of demos “Out everywhere except Spotify (fuck Spotify),” and adding, true to the spirit of the thing, “You can bootleg it if you wanna.” The band recently released its 27th album, Phantom Island, and is currently in the midst of an American leg of a 2025 world tour.

Ahead of November release of Predator: Badlands, a new cut of Dan Trachtenberg's last Predator flick will debut on Hulu. At the stage in Hall H this afternoon at San Diego Comic-Con, Trachtenberg shared that a new cut of Predator: Killer Of Killers—the animated Predator movie that debuted in June—will hit Hulu tonight, bringing back a handful of characters from earlier parts of the franchise.

The primary thing that's different from the previous cut on the streamer seems to be a new epilogue. Those in attendance this afternoon got a look at the epilogue, which Deadline reports includes Arnold Schwarzenegger's Dutch from the 1987 original film, Danny Glover's Lieutenant Mike Harrigan from the 1990 sequel, and Amber Midhunter's Naru, which led the 2022 film Prey, which also debuted on Hulu. The outlet reports that Trachenberg told the crowd he got clearance to use Schwarzenegger's likeness over breakfast and to make it canon that Dutch is still floating around out there. (So if or when there are more animated Predator movies, it sounds like there's a good chance that Dutch will be part of them.)

Predator: Badlands premieres in theaters on November 7, making it the first Predator film to get a theatrical release since 2018's The Predator. Badlands stars Elle Fanning and Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi (who tackle an android and Predator in exile, respectively) and is helmed by Trachenberg, his third entry into the franchise after Prey and Killer Of Killers.

Hulk Hogan‘s family is still processing the loss of the wrestling icon, who died unexpectedly at age 71. Though Brooke Hogan hasn't spoken publicly since the death of her father, Hulk Hogan, her husband and close friend are speaking on her behalf. 

Hogan, whose real name was Terry Gene Bollea, died on July 24 following a reported cardiac arrest at his Clearwater, Florida home. While Brooke has remained silent, her longtime friend Ashley Kora took to Instagram Stories with a moving tribute.

“My dear sweet friend @mizzhogan lost her father today,” Ashley wrote over a black-and-white photo of Brooke with her dad, as per E! News. “He died knowing what I know—Brooke loved him deeply, was fiercely loyal, and only ever wanted him to be peaceful, happy, and surrounded by people who valued him for who he really was.”

Ashley added, “He chose differently for himself. But we can still remember him as a doting father to a little girl with big dreams and a bigger heart. The world lost a legend, we lost Mr. Bollea, Brooke's dad.”

Brooke's husband, retired NHL player Steven Oleksy, reposted Ashley's tribute with a heartfelt message of his own. As per E! News, he responded: “Thank you for the love and support for my beautiful wife. We are incredibly lucky to have you in our lives—not just during this challenging time, but always.”

While the outpouring of love underscores Brooke's deep affection for her father, the two were not in contact at the time of his passing. However, in the weeks leading up to his death, Hulk Hogan and his daughter, Brooke, shared a rare, heartfelt conversation that brought quiet closure. 

According to TMZ, their final exchange, just two weeks before his 2023 wedding, was emotional, with Brooke expressing love and concern for his health, and Hogan offering a soft apology that she has held onto ever since.

Brooke, 37, and her younger brother Nick, 34, are Hulk's children with ex-wife Linda, to whom he was married for 26 years. Despite their split, Linda posted a nostalgic throwback photo with Hulk just days before his death, captioned, “The good old days!”

A post shared by Linda Hogan (@linda_hogan_)

Earlier this year, Brooke welcomed twins, Oliver and Molly, with Steven, marking a new chapter in her life as a mother while still grappling with a complicated family past.

“RIP to a legend,” Draftkings posted, including a video of one of Hogan's most iconic moments.

Suri Cruise, the only child of former couple Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, was spotted looking stunning as she strolled the streets of New York City on July 9, 2025. The 19-year-old wore a flowy low-rise skirt and cropped white tank top. She completed her look with sneakers, wired earbuds, and a slouchy bag.

In a July 11 feature, Teen Vogue declared Suri has nailed “cool-girl” summer dressing, and praised her for incorporating the “clean girl” aesthetic, a TikTok term used to denote sleek simplicity, without becoming basic. The story says Suri's masterful use of interesting accessories elevates her basics to a level of street coolness. 

According to Hello! magazine, the stylish teen started college at Carnegie Mellon University in August 2024. “Of course, I will miss the close proximity, but I'm really proud of her and I'm happy,” the outlet says mom Katie Holmes told Town & Country about Suri's new chapter. 

A post shared by Elder Ordonez (@elderordonez1)

Holmes posed with Joshua Jackson in July 2025 to promote their film “HAPPY HOURS” wearing unique frayed two-tone denim pants, after opening up to Vogue in the spring about one of her go-to “outfit formulas” for the season.

A post shared by Katie Holmes (@katieholmes)

“I can't wait to get back into a tank top. I usually wear them with a long skirt or baggy pants, so it feels very comfortable,” said the “Dawson's Creek” actress. She also named “nice, simple slip dresses” as an essential. 

But Katie Holmes also appreciates an occasion to get dressed up. “Wearing a glamorous dress to the ballet or opera makes me feel like I am the New York woman I dreamt of being when I was a little girl,” she told the “Fashion Bible.”

Katie Holmes famously dated her “Dawson's Creek” costar Joshua Jackson from 1998 to 1999, per Grazia. Now, fans are thrilled to see the pair side-by-side again as they work on their upcoming film, which Bustle says is a “love story.”

The photo Holmes posted with Jackson, under which she wrote she “so very grateful” to be working on the project, garnered a quarter of a million likes in three days and greatly excited fans.

“JOEY AND PACEY FOREVER,” wrote one, referencing the pair's “Dawson's Creek” characters.

“You know you triggered an entire generation with this post,” teased another, before adding, “Cannot wait to see the project.”

A third fan quoted the show's famous line, “I remember everything,” and punctuated it with a crying emoji.

Deadline says Holmes is “set to write, direct, and star” in “Happy Hours,” which will be a feature film trilogy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Doctor Who Tried to Rescue Beloved Malcolm-Jamal Warner Speaks Out","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/malcolm-jamal-warner-doctor-rescue-details/","Sat, 26 Jul 2025 03:18:59 GMT","

The doctor who tried to save the late Malcolm-Jamal Warner is sharing his story. The doctor recalled how he pulled Warner out of the “rough” Costa Rica ocean and brought him to shore.

A post shared by Jennifer Hudson (@iamjhud)

In a July 2025 interview with Us Weekly, the doctor, who asked not to be identified by name, shared that he was enjoying his vacation at the time of the incident.

“I was about 200 meters from the incident, at Playa Grande, spending the day on vacation with my partner,” he recalled. “There were very few people on the beach, and the sea was rough.”

According to the outlet, the doctor heard people calling for help. “I ran to the area and entered the sea with my surfboard, heading into the rip current toward the person being pointed at by some beachgoers,” the doctor shared. 

He continued, “After a few minutes, I saw a shadow, dove down and pulled the person out.”

The doctor got back to the beach and found another man lying on the sand who was struggling to breathe. “[He was] just someone who tried to help during the emergency, without any rescue equipment,” the doctor noted.

He went on to describe the emergency personnel who arrived on scene. “Immediately, [first responders] began providing first aid to Malcolm, but he had no vital signs,” the doctor recalled. 

He added, “Two tourists ran over to help. They identified themselves as doctors, making a total of three physicians at the scene.”

Red Cross personnel arrived and used specialized equipment, including a defibrillator, but Warner did not respond. He was pronounced dead at the scene at age 54.

The other man was transported to a local medical clinic and was later released.

“The people who take part in this kind of rescue are always deeply affected,” the doctor shared. “You have to understand it's not easy, and it also takes time to heal.”

A post shared by Yvette Nicole Brown (@yvettenicolebrown)

Elberth León, head of the Tourist Police for Costa Rica's Atlantic region, initially said Warner's 8-year-old daughter was in the water with him and was rescued, but new reports say otherwise.

Costa Rica's Judicial Investigation Agency (OIJ) confirmed she was on the shore at the time of the incident, People reports.

“Mr. Warner was playing with his daughter at the seashore at one point. He then left her out of the water, and he and a friend of his entered the sea,” the statement read.

“It was at that moment that they were swept away by the current, and the friend managed to get out,” the statement noted. “However, Mr. Warner was unable to get out and was pulled out by several people on the beach. He received care from Red Cross officials, but was pronounced dead at the scene.”

The actor's cause of death was ruled “asphyxiation by submersion.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","SEE: Hulk Hogan Announced His Engagement at Friend's Wedding [VIDEO]","https://entertainmentnow.com/sports-news-today/hulk-hogan-sky-daily-engagement-party/","Sat, 26 Jul 2025 00:30:03 GMT","

The wrestling world is still reeling from the loss of WWE icon Hulk Hogan, who died on July 24 at the age of 71. But the grief is especially profound for those closest to him, his family and his wife, Sky Daily, who is mourning the man she lovingly called her partner and heart.

Before becoming husband & wife, Hogan and Daily shared a whirlwind love story that began with a chance meeting at a party. The pair were reunited by mutual friends Corin Nemec and Sabrina Nova, who later played matchmakers and watched their friends fall in love.

In a memorable speech at Nemec's wedding, Hogan announced his own engagement to the crowd.

A post shared by Sky Daily Hogan (@mrs.sky.hogan)

“She was crazy enough to say ‘Yes,' brother,” Hogan quipped, nodding to his signature catchphrase. According to The Los Angeles Times, the WWE Hall of Famer had proposed just three days earlier over dinner, presenting Sky with a diamond ring.

A post shared by Hulk Hogan (@hulkhogan)

Hogan, whose real name was Terry Gene Bollea, married Daily in an intimate ceremony in Clearwater, Florida, in September 2023.

As seen in photos obtained by TMZ, the couple maintained an elegant yet simple style. Hogan wore a classic black tuxedo, paired with his signature black bandana, while Sky stunned in a strapless, glittery white gown by Rue de Seine, featuring a sweetheart neckline and a lace train. The small wedding reflected their deep bond, far from the spotlight of the wrestling ring.

A post shared by Sky Daily Hogan (@mrs.sky.hogan)

Daily, a yoga instructor and mother of three, had been by Hogan's side throughout his final chapter. The couple's love story began after a casual thank-you turned into something more. Sky had approached Hogan to express gratitude after he bought drinks for their group, and the spark ignited from there.

Later, Hogan would credit Nova for encouraging him to call Sky after their first meeting. That call led to a relationship that eventually became one of the most important in his life.

A post shared by Sky Daily Hogan (@mrs.sky.hogan)

Following Hogan's death, Daily shared an emotional tribute, saying her “heart is in pieces.”

“This loss is sudden and impossible to process,” she wrote. “To the world, he was a legend… but to me, he was my Terry. The man I loved. My partner. My heart.”

A post shared by Sky Daily Hogan (@mrs.sky.hogan)

As fans across the globe remember Hulk Hogan for his legendary career, Sky Daily remembers him as the man behind the fame, the one she planned a future with.

The future of “Star Trek” is here and it truly is boldly going to some new and undiscovered places. (Check out our ranking of every “Star Trek” live-action show). The message from Paramount+'s presentation for the franchise July 26 at San Diego Comic-Con‘s Hall H isn't boundary- and format-pushing alone: It's clear that they want to package new things with some heavy doses of the familiar — major stars, beloved returning franchise vets, and some cutesy gimmicks.

Take a look at the teaser for “Star Trek: Starfleet Academy.”

 










There are a ton of new faces there for the 32nd Century-set show, as much of the cast is teenage and 20-something newcomers. And it's set in a time period, post-“Star Trek: Discovery” that allows for all-new storytelling completely unrestrained by preexisting canon. But that's also a lot of unfamiliar stuff, and audiences can need a little dose of the familiar to anchor them.

So “Starfleet Academy” has a couple of top stars — both Oscar winners, no less — to lend the appropriate gravitas: Hell yeah, Holly Hunter should be someone who leads the next generation into the future as the chancellor of Starfleet Academy — who wouldn't trust her with her college-age kids in the 32nd Century or now? And Paul Giamatti adds just the right edge of menace, whistling the “Star Trek” theme as his “Klingon hybrid” villain, to let us know that Starfleet better look out.

Then there's a returning favorite in Robert Picardo's The Doctor, who apparently is not just another hologram in his series, but literally the exact same Doctor from “Voyager” who's survived more than eight centuries to have his story continue on this show. Continuity with his arc from that show is something showrunners Alex Kurtzman and Noga Landau are promising. (There's also Tig Notaro returning from “Discovery” as Jett Reno, something she told IndieWire she very much wanted to do.)

And there are a couple of intriguing callbacks to keep fans hooked as well: There's a Jem'Hadar Starfleet officer? (A member of the menacing warrior species from “Deep Space Nine.”) And another mysterious “DS9” shoutout as well, as a computer display at the title academy seems to have information on it related to the fate of that show's Capt. Benjamin Sisko — did he die at the end of that series, or did he live on? Whether that is just a throwaway moment or a teaser for a deeper exploration on “Starfleet Academy” remains to be seen.

And across the “Star Trek” portfolio presented at Hall H, this model of some familiarity being mixed in with the new stuff as a kind of sweetener to make swallowing the unfamiliar more palatable was everywhere.

For the first time ever, “Star Trek” is making a push into the audio storytelling space with “Star Trek: Khan,” a podcast about the legendary “Trek” villain in his years after his introduction on the “Original Series” episode “Space Seed” when he and his crew are marooned on Ceti Alpha V. Naveen Andrews, the actor fancast for years as Khan (and should have been cast in “Star Trek Into Darkness”), will be voicing the character.

 










Andrews will be joined by a couple of returning vets: George Takei as Capt. Hikaru Sulu and Tim Russ as young Ensign Tuvok. In the years after Khan's final defeat they uncover more information that allows Khan's story to unfold in flashback. This is a canon-friendly way of presenting this story as we know from a '90s “Voyager” episode that Tuvok served with Sulu aboard the USS Excelsior. Check out the “Star Trek: Khan” trailer here:

And finally, “Star Trek” is nothing without a good gimmick, and “Strange New Worlds” teased that in Season 4 there will be an episode staged entirely with puppets created by the Jim Henson Workshop. Somehow Capt. Pike has even higher, more lush hair here. A little felt is the ultimate volumizer, one supposes. Here's a sneak peek:

That doesn't do anything to counter our charge that “Strange New Worlds” is maybe veering a little too far into the insubstantial, but it shows the elasticity of “Star Trek” in allowing for so many different kinds of stunts. It also reminds me of how in 2005 as an April Fool's Day joke, the StarTrek.com website announced that “Star Trek: Enterprise” would be continuing but only via marionettes to cut down on costs. For a second, teenage me believed that. But I guess I only needed to wait 20 years for some puppet-based storytelling in “Star Trek” to become a reality.

On July 26, Deadline reported that “Bend it Like Beckham” will be bending it like Beckham once again, or so says its writer/director Gurinder Chadha. The original film, released 23 years ago in 2022 and starring Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley was an indie sleeper hit, grossing $76 million on a $6 million budget.

The comedy ended up being the harbinger of Knightley's astronomical rise into stardom — coming just one year before “Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl” and “Love Actually.” In it, she is one of two soccer playing girls (the other played by Nagra), who attempt to pursue the sport professionally (and it's called football there, obviously).

“I'm excited to revisit the original characters and revive the enduring story and build on the legacy we helped to create for the women's game,” Chadha said, adding that “I'm pretty certain that everyone's going to want to come back” and that the original cast was aware the movie was in development.

 










Knightley told Jimmy Fallon in 2023 that she did not anticipate that the film would be any kind of hit. In fact, because people told her the title was “embarrassing,” she reassured herself that no one would see it. “It was the idea of it because, you know, women's soccer was not as big back then,” she explained. “And so the idea of the whole thing was sort of ridiculous.”

The actual Beckhams, of course, are ever-present in the cultural conversation. The couple — David and Victoria — made a cameo in the original film, named in Beckham's honor. David was also the subject of the Netflix's  “Beckham,”  which ended up winning the Emmy for Outstanding Documentary Series last year. The show followed the both his and Victoria's personal and professional lives, and its most famous scene became a meme-of-the-moment.

In the first episode (of four), Victoria said that both she and David came from working class families, to which David pushed Victoria to admit that her father drove her to school in a Rolls Royce. In 2024, editor Michael Harte discussed this scene with IndieWire. “You gotta give massive credit to [director Fisher Stevens,” Harte said. “That scene is, if anything, a representation of how good he was at getting people to relax in front of the camera. And also Tim Cragg, our cinematographer, who had the wisdom to keep the camera going back and forth. The person that deserves the least amount of credit is me, because it's probably the least amount of editing in the whole series!”

 










A more Victoria-centric doc is set to release soon, also from Netflix, of which David said, “It took a minute to try and get her to agree with it… It wasn't something that was easy. I think I'm the only one who could convince her and I did, eventually.” But he added that viewers would see her “in a delightful light.” The series will cover Victoria's entire career. “I think it's going to be really special. It's so emotional, there's drama — and the drama's real,” David said.

If the long, twist-filled “Coyote vs. Acme” fight for a release was “It's a Wonderful Life,” then Ketchup Entertainment would be all the townspeople at the end (79-year-old spoiler) chipping in to make sure George Bailey doesn't go under. That's as far as the analogy goes, though film fans can easily guess who is Mr. Potter in this scenario.

Regardless, the townspeople have won the day, and “Coyote vs. Acme” is indeed on its way — finally — with a theatrical release set for August 28, 2026. To sum things up as quickly as possible: the $70 million live-action/animated movie was one of a few (paging “Batgirl”) that were shelved in 2023 as tax write-offs for Warner Bros. (to the tune of $30 million), even though the movie had tested well. After a fan outcry, the film was put up for sale to other studios… but then it quickly was dead in the water again, when nobody met the price WB wanted. A cast and crew screening funeral was even held for the movie. It was dead. George Bailey was going to jump off the bridge.

Enter Clarence- eh… “The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Toons Movie,” which Ketchup distributed though it was only set for a streaming HBO Max (or Max at the time) release. They then made a deal earlier this year for “Coyote vs. Acme,” which the film's star Will Forte expressed relief over earlier this year, telling THR, “I never thought it would happen so it just came out of nowhere and I'm so thrilled,” he said. “Thank you Ketchup Entertainment, I'm so excited for people to see this movie. I'm gonna promote the crap out of it, just tell me what you want me to do and I'll go, I'll do whatever — go to the top of Mount Everest, I'm there.”

The movie directed by Dave Green, also stars John Cena, Lana Condor, Tone Bell, and Martha Kelly. The plot has Wile E. Coyote finally taking Acme Corporation to court after all the injuries he suffered at their hands in his Road Runner pursuit. Oscar nominee Samy Burch wrote the script and producers include Chris deFaria and James Gunn.

So the film's San Diego Comic-Con panel, to say the least, was hotly anticipated. And Ketchup did not disappoint. 

“This movie wasn't suppose to come out,” panel moderator Paul Scheer said (via Deadline). “I heard Warner Bros wouldn't release the film — I've never heard of Warner Bros! This is really an Acme decision and I'm saying that for legal purposes.”

The even had “an Acme lawyer” appear, attempting to halt the film's release.

“These are cease and desist papers from the Acme Corporation. You do not have permission to share information and footage from this anti-Acme film. Please leave the stage,” the performer said, then addressed a cosplaying audience member, “As a copyrighted costume, sir, please disrobe.”

Coyote himself was on the panel, answering questions with signs that read “Yes,” “No,” and “It's a Limited Number of Signs.” Voice of Bugs Bunny Eric Bauza (in character) said that the movie was produced “without the use of A.I. and basketball players.”

 










The audience got a sneak peek of the Wile E. Coyote's starring feature, showcasing a scene that includes a montage of all the Acme products that has malfunctioned for him over the years — all to the tune of “Hurt” as performed by Johnny Cash. Then he sees a commercial for Forte's personal injury attorney, who asks, “Have you ever pulled the ripcord to your parachute and only silverware fell out?” Another courtroom scene featured a faulty roller skate and Cena.

May the other shelved Warner Bros. properties — which also includes another animated film “Scoob! Holiday Haunt” — one day find such a rebirth. Until then, they await discovery at the Island of Misfit Toys. But that is another analogy for another day.

Until then, check out “Coyote vs. Acme” in theaters August 28, 2026. And here is the first poster for the film.

If you're not watching “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” right now, you're missing appointment television. To say the gloves have come off since Colbert's cancellation announcement last week would be a gross understatement. Not that Colbert really ever held back on his opinions, but a host scorned hath more fury.

On Thursday, July 24, he even introduced a monologue cut-away segment “Show Un-Cancelled.” Of course, that announcement turns out to be a fake-out — and the graphic used for it supposedly cost $40 million. That one's light hearted — no more scathing than what “Arrested Development” threw down in its last season on Fox (anyone old enough to remember that reference?). Throughout the first week of shows as a fallen angel, however, Colbert repeatedly seemed to play chicken with his network, CBS, and its parent company, Paramount, which just got the OK from the Trump Justice Department for a merger with Skydance (set to close August 7.) Not only did he reference the cancellation and the Skydance deal numerous times, he also went even harder on Trump.

An then the other late night shows went just as hard (or harder) on CBS and Paramount. On Monday, July 21, most of the other hosts even appeared in a Colbert segment, showcasing support for their competitor. References abounded in their own segments — some humorous, some ominous warnings — including some strong words from Jon Stewart on “The Daily Show,” which airs on fellow Paramount property Comedy Central.

 










“Shows that say something, shows that take a stand, shows that are unafraid — this is not a ‘We speak truth to power.' We don't. We speak opinions to television cameras. But we try. We fucking try, every night,” Stewart said. “And if you believe, as corporations or as networks, you can make yourself so innocuous that you can serve a gruel so flavorless that you will never again be on the boy king's radar — A) Why will anyone watch you? And [B)] you are fucking wrong.”

Fellow hosts Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel, meanwhile, seem to be next on Trump's cancellation wish list — considering he called for their cancellation and all. Fallon has been on vacation, and therefore has not had a monologue with which to respond. He did, however, write a statement that told the network, “Fuck you and all your Sheldons CBS.”

On the July 21 show, Fallon said, “I am your host, well… at least for tonight. I don't like it. I don't like what's going on one bit.”

Fallon did get in a dig at CBS' streaming platform, adding, “And many people are now threatening to boycott the network. Yep. CBS could lose millions of viewers plus tens of hundreds watching on Paramount+.” “The Tonight Show” host also sang about Trump's continued Epstein drama and his late night interests in the song below.

 










Comedy Central seems to have gotten the last laugh — so far, at least — on the whole debacle. The AI-segment seen 'round the world this week came courtesy of “South Park,” who delivered perhaps the most blistering satire of President Donald Trump yet. This came just hours after the series closed a deal with Paramount to continue for another five years, and just a day before the Justice Department approved the merger. The Wednesday, July 23 episode of “South Park” also spoke quite literally to the Skydance deal in a scene involving none other than Jesus Christ.

“You guys saw what happened to CBS,” Christ mutters through gritted teeth. “Well guess who owns CBS? Paramount! You really want to end up like Colbert?

Then on July 25, former “Late Show” legend David Letterman, Colbert's predecessor, chimed in on his YouTube channel.

“I don't think it was money… it was pure cowardice,” Letterman said, going on to praise “precise, crisp, witty political satirist” Colbert. He then addressed CBS/Paramount's decision, saying “What the fuck is Skydance, honest to Christ? Is it a discount airline? Is that what it is? I think one day, if not today, the people at CBS, who have manipulated and handled this are going to be embarrassed because this is this is gutless. I only wish this could happen to me… Fighting with network television management was number one in the playbook.”

 










But no one went harder on Paramount than Colbert himself. In its statements discussing “The Late Show” cancellation, Paramount repeatedly made mention of the show's $40 million annual losses. This figure has been questioned, and it was a number referenced repeatedly by Colbert all week.

“I could see us losing $24 million, but where could Paramount have possibly spent the other 16… Oh yeah,” he said on the July 21 episode. 

In the July 23 episode, he referenced how Trump claimed that CBS/Paramount would be providing another $20 million a year in administration-approved airtime.

“By bending the knee, they lost like $40 million this year,” Colbert said. “They better watch out. They might get canceled for purely financial reasons.”

This was just the tip of the iceberg for Colbert. It almost seems as if the stalwart late night presence is daring CBS to cancel him before May 2026, an idea also postured this week by Time. Certainly his tone was not one that sounds… uh, let's say copasetic, with his employers. 

But you be the judge. What's Colbert's game? Here's a few of his daring comments from the week's shows, mined from his full monologues:

“Over the weekend it sunk in that they're killing off our show. But they made one mistake: They left me alive!”

 










“All the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't hide who Dumpty humped with his friend.”

“It's not a great look when you fly on the pedophile's plane enough times to earn diamond pervert status.”

“What are you gonna tell me next — that the Pope is in the Catholic files? That a bear is on the cover of this month's Modern Woods Pooper?”

And of course, he did also say succinctly, “The President was buddies with a pedophile.”

The gloves certainly are off.

The trailer for the second season of “Peacemaker” has arrived. Revealed at San Diego Comic-Con on July 26, the John Cena-starring DC Comics comes just two weeks after the release of “Superman,” the kinda official-ish soft-ish reboot of the DC Universe courtesy of now-steward James Gunn. The new season, it was revealed during the Comic-Con panel, will take place a month after the events of “Superman.” “Peacemaker” will arrive on HBO Max on August 21 at 9 p.m. ET/PT.

In a May interview with Entertainment Weekly, Gunn said that getting back around to “Peacemaker” — which premiered its first season long ago in 2022 — was top-of-mind when he took the DC Universe gig. “Once I was done with ‘Peacemaker,' I had to do ‘Guardians 3,' and then when I was about ready to jump [back] into ‘Peacemaker,' I got hired to be the head of DC,” he said. “As soon as I got that job, I made a couple of calls, and the first one was to [Marvel's] Kevin Feige telling him that I'm taking the [job as] head of DC. The second one was to John Cena, and I said, ‘I'm getting this gig, and I still want to do ‘Peacemaker,' but it's going to have to wait. We're going to have to get ‘Superman' working first.'”

The second “Peacemaker” installment being part of the “soft reboot” of the DC Universe was first mentioned way back in 2023, which Gunn also acknowledged.

 










“I developed it along the way, in conjunction with the other DC projects that we're doing, so it's very much connected to ‘Superman' and it's very much connected to what comes after,” he explained. “I had a rough idea of what I was going to do, but it was actually quite different than what the show ended up being.”

Gunn relayed how some elements of the first season play into the second season of “Peacemaker.” “You've seen what we call the QUC, the Quantum Unfolding Chamber, in the first season of Peacemaker, and we see more about that technology in ‘Superman'. The QUC is the center of the story in ‘Peacemaker' Season 2,” he said.

Apparently, some “Superman” characters are even going to wander over to “Peacemaker.” Gunn has also noted previously, though, that the Marvel Cinematic Universe's rather, uh… universal tone is not the objective for DC. Discussing 2027's “Clayface,” Gunn said (via ScreenRant), “We've got ‘Clayface,' which is a totally different thing. Although it's in the same universe, it's a complete horror film. That's one of the things we want to do. There's not a company style. It's not like every movie is going to be like ‘Superman.' The artists — the directors and the writers — each one will bring their own sense to it… That's what we want to bring to the films because we don't want people to get bored. We want to invigorate people.”

 










Cena appeared on the Comic-Con panel in full costume, thrilling the fan-packed audience. Gunn discussed the direction Cena's character would he taking, saying (via ScreenRant) “Peacemaker is a different guy this season. He's dealing with the demons he accepted in the first season.”

So, to sum it up, though “Peacemaker” premiered while the previous DCEU was still in its waning days, Gunn was at the helm, and so it is still canon in the new DCU — or at least the second season is really, really canon. And the events of “Superman” happened one month before the new season's events. Got it?

Check out the “Peacemaker” Season 2 trailer below and watch on HBO Max August 21 at 9 p.m. ET/PT.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","Anti-Flag's Justin Sane Ordered to Pay Nearly $2 Million in Damages in Sexual Assault Lawsuit","https://pitchfork.com/news/anti-flags-justin-sane-ordered-to-pay-nearly-2-million-in-damages-in-sexual-assault-lawsuit/","Sat, 26 Jul 2025 17:30:21 GMT","

Former Anti-Flag frontman Justin Sane has been ordered to pay nearly $2 million in damages to a woman who alleged that he raped her in 2010, Rolling Stone reports and Pitchfork can confirm. The woman, Kristina Sarhadi, filed a lawsuit against Justin Sane, whose legal name is Justin Cathal Geever, in 2023, but the singer never responded to the complaint in court. As a result, Judge Brenda K. Sannes granted a default judgment against Justin Sane.

Judge Sannes handed down her ruling on Tuesday, July 22. She awarded Sarhadi $1,170,800 in damages related to her claims of assault, battery, and sexual battery. She awarded Sarhadi a further $750,000 in punitive damages. Judge Sannes also denied Sarhadi's motion for default judgment with respect to a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress. Pitchfork has reached out to Justin Sane and attorneys for Sarhadi for comment on the judgment.

Sarhadi initially filed her lawsuit in a New York state court, under New York's Adult Survivors Act, but the case was moved to a federal court at the beginning of 2024. In her complaint, Sarhadi alleged that Justin Sane “strangled her, forced her to perform oral sex on him, and raped her” at a motel when she was 21 years old.

Sarhadi's lawsuit arrived months after Anti-Flag's sudden breakup. Justin Sane's former bandmates eventually explained that allegations of sexual assault contributed to the group's dissolution. Justin Sane denied that he committed sexual assault, but numerous women, including Sarhadi, soon came forward to speak with Rolling Stone about Justin Sane's allegedly predatory and abusive behavior.

7.8

Genre:

It is certainly a surprise to hear Tyler Childers fantasize about making a pilgrimage to Kurukshetra—an Indian city north of Delhi where the Mahabharata was set—but it is not a shock. While he may be the first person with a Kentucky drawl to sing about dharma, rolling “like the Pandavas” with his brothers, and bringing his wife and mother to a nirvana-like oasis where they sing Hare Krishna and West Virginia fiddle standards alike, it is, somehow, not completely out of the way for one of country music's most singular artists.

Ever since Purgatory, his now-classic 2017 album, turned him into a star Appalachia could call their own, Childers has made it his mission to redefine what that means. Yes, his father worked in the coal industry. Yes, he grew up in a trailer that sat next to a Baptist church. And yes, he plays a fiddle as if he's soundtracking bootleggers in a wagon race. But he also was one of the few country stars to speak up in support of Black Lives Matter in 2020. Two years later, he made a gospel record that preached interfaith harmony, and more recently, he became the first country artist on a major label to release a music video that features a gay love story.

For years, Childers has dealt in statements and had his “legitimacy” as a country musician pinballed by press and fans. His music has never been co-opted by outside noise, but his releases have been neatly packaged and limited in scope. Long Violent History is strictly a fiddle record; Can I Take My Hounds to Heaven? is his take on gospel; Rustin' in the Rain channels Elvis. On Snipe Hunter, however, he lets everything hang in the wind, blending vintage ballads, rockabilly, and psychedelia with renewed artistic freedom. It's his most free-spirited and pleasantly weird album to date.

Perhaps it was the magic touch of producer Rick Rubin or the tranquility of recording in Hawaii and Malibu that allowed Childers to drop his shoulders. Regardless, Snipe Hunter reveals his quirks while staying true to the traditions that made him. There is a Southern-rock ripper that sounds like an oncoming panic attack (“Snipe Hunt”), a ragtime stomp about the person Childers would bite first if he had rabies (“Bitin' List”), and a pair of tracks on the back end (“Tirtha Yarti,” “Tomcat and a Dandy”) that play on his admiration of Hinduism, even interpolating a Hare Krishna chant in the style of a 19th-century battle hymn. (In a GQ interview, Childers described a recent trip to India, where he became acquainted with “Krishna devotees” whose practice gave him “just as much strength and guidance as his Christian upbringing.”)

Even with these more experimental elements, this is still a Tyler Childers album, rooted in vulnerable songwriting and tonal grit. Take “Eatin' Big Time,” where he scowls like a mad, gluttonous king and gives a gruesome account of gutting prey, eventually demanding to know if his audience has ever had the chance “to hold and blow a thousand fucking dollars?!” This chaotic, semi-ironic opener leads into “Cuttin' Teeth,” a serene, pedal steel-led tune about the early days of a country singer, presumably Childers, who lives gig-to-gig with a “bunch of West Virginia deadbeats.” He sounds wistful, as if things were a whole lot simpler back then.

The most poignant tracks are two singles, “Oneida” and “Nose on the Grindstone,” known to fans from previously released live versions. Both originate in Childers' Purgatory era, a period defined by hunger and heartache, and follow the stripped-down, “three chords and the truth” recipe that shot him to fame. The polished, Rubin-produced studio versions simultaneously recall Childers' initial flame and mark its evolution—an evolution realized in the richly layered arrangement of “Getting to the Bottom,” where he celebrates his nearly six years of sobriety by wondering just how hammered his old drinking buddies are right now.

As intentional and disciplined as Childers' releases have been, it's refreshing to hear him make an album without an agenda or a rulebook. Through the detours into Australian ecology and the cheeky mispronunciations of Sanskrit words, he's still what everyone says he is: an Appalachian man with a penchant for storytelling. Snipe Hunter is his first record to capture and celebrate the depth behind that.

	An investigation is underway in Oklahoma after a television screen in the MAGA state school superintendent's office reportedly showed a video of nude women during an executive session of the State Board of Education on Thursday. 


	The images reportedly appeared on a screen in the office of Ryan Walters, Oklahoma's far-right Superintendent of Public Instruction. Walters previously told schools to teach the Bible and Ten Commandments, demanded students watch him pray for Donald Trump, and named transphobe Chaya Raichik to a state education committee. He also tried to use state money to purchase bibles for classrooms that matched the specifics of those marketed by the president and his family.


	As you might expect, Walters has led a crusade against “pornography” in school libraries. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Two members of the Oklahoma board of education said they were shocked at what they saw on the screen on Thursday. 


	“I was like, ‘Those are naked women,'” board member Becky Carson told The Oklahoman. “And then I was like, ‘No, wait a minute. Those aren't naked, surely those aren't naked women. Something is playing a trick on my eye. Maybe they just have on tan body suits. … This is just really bizarre.'”

	











	“I saw them just walking across the screen, and I'm like, ‘no.” I'm sorry I even have to use this language, but I'm like, ‘Those are her nipples.' And then I'm like, ‘That's pubic hair.' What in the world am I watching? I didn't watch a second longer.”

	











	Carson told Walters to turn the video off. 


	“I was so disturbed by it, that I was like — very loudly and boastfully, like I was a parent or a teacher — I said, ‘What is on your TV? What am I watching?' He was like, ‘What? What are you talking about?' He stood up and saw it. He made acknowledgment that he saw it,” Carson said, according to NonDoc Media, an Oklahoma news website.  “And I said, ‘Turn it off. Now.' And he was like, ‘What is this? What is this?' So he acknowledged it was inappropriate just by those words. And he was like, ‘I can't get it to turn off. I can't figure out how to turn it off.' And I said, ‘Get it turned off.' So he finally got it turned off, and that was the end of it. He didn't address it. He didn't apologize. Nothing was said.”

	Carson and board member Ryan Deatherage said the video looked “retro” and did not involve sexual intercourse. 


	“I don't know if he turned it off or switched the channel, I don't remember,” Deatherage told NonDoc. “I was surprised that when he came back to the table, he was not apologetic. I didn't ever hear an apology for that being on, and he didn't seem to be fazed that it was on.”


	Republican state Senate President Pro Tempore Lonnie Paxton told Oklahoma Voice that the Office of Management and Enterprise Services is carrying out an investigation into the incident. 


	“This is a bizarre and troubling situation that raises serious questions about the events and what took place during yesterday's executive session at the Oklahoma State Board of Education meeting,” Paxton said in a statement. “The accounts made public by board members paint a strange, unsettling scene that demands clarity and transparency.”


	Walters said the claims were a distraction.


	“Some of these board members are blatantly dishonest and cannot hide their political agenda,” Walters told KOKH Fox 25. “It is disappointing that they are more interested in creating distractions than getting work done for Oklahoma families.”

	Walters' communications director, Quinton Hitchcock, called the story a “junk tabloid lie,” according to NonDoc.  


	“Regardless of if recent allegations are true, Oklahomans are in dire need of new leadership at the Oklahoma State Department of Education,” Oklahoma House Democratic Leader Cyndi Munson told KOKH Fox 25.


	“These are serious allegations made by two members of the State Board and an expeditious third-party review is warranted,” Republican House Speaker Kyle Hilbert said in a statement. “I urge the State Superintendent to unlock and turn over all relevant devices and fully cooperate with an investigation.”

	











	“If no wrongdoing occurred, a prompt and transparent review should quickly clear his name,” he added.


	Last year, the Oklahoma State Department of Education's Library Media Advisory Committee — which includes Raichik, who runs the anti-trans Libs of TikTok social media account — attempted to ban The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini and The Glass Castle by Jeannette Walls from Edmond high school libraries. The committee argued that the books are “pornographic.” 


	“Edmond Public Schools not only allows kids to access porn in schools, they are doubling down to keep pornography on the bookshelves,” Walters said in a statement. “Parents and kids should have the confidence of going to schools to learn. Instead of focusing on education, EPS has chosen to peddle porn and is leading the charge to undermine parents in Oklahoma.”


	The case went to the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which sided with Edmond Public Schools and allowed the books to remain on library shelves.

	The list goes on. In 2023, Walters reportedly emailed some Oklahoma lawmakers pornographic images, claiming they were available in schools. 


	“Don't just send me a bunch of graphic, sexually explicit photos without where it came from, or what did they do? That's kind of the problem I got with it,” state Rep. Mark McBride (R) told the local Fox outlet.

	If Bad Bunny were your standard artist, he could have — and probably would have — orchestrated the kind of tour that guarantees superstardom and an ever-growing fanbase, filling up stadiums across the U.S. and the rest of the globe to rake in more attention and money. But precisely what's made him one of the most beloved and compelling figures in music in recent years is that he's never treated himself like the bottom line — instead, the goal for him has always been to show the world a little bit of Puerto Rico. 


	This is part of the impulse behind “No Me Quiero Ir De Aqui,” his 30-date residency in Puerto Rico's famed 18,500-person arena El Coliseo de Puerto Rico José Miguel Agrelot. The idea is not just intriguing from an artistic point of view, but genuinely poignant: Not only is it a celebration of home and roots and tradition, it's an invitation for fans outside of Puerto Rico to truly immerse themselves in the place he comes from. But on top of all of that, the residency is also a muscular three-hour, 30-song marathon, intensely high on spectacle and production, that functions as a full-voiced love letter to his country and his fellow Puerto Ricans.

	











	That love and pride is reciprocal: In San Juan, a day before his show this Friday, bars and cars blasted his music on repeat. Giant murals with his face have gone up in the city; a few others feature Concho, the delightful toad character that's become a staple in videos and promo from his latest album DeBÍ TiRAR MÁS FOTOS, which the show is crafted around. Fans flooded the area outside of El Coliseo, which has turned into a mini-festival block, with food stands and pop-ups, touting flags and jibaro hats before rushing into the arena for the prompt 9 p.m. start time — no one wanted to miss a second of what Benito was about to put out there.

	Right on time, the lights went out, revealing the decadent stage, designed to look the untouched, undeveloped version of the island's oceans and mountains. Two dancers appeared onstage to talk about the history of Puerto Rico before the percussion of “ALAMBRE PúA” boomed in. Bad Bunny debuted the song at the first show in the residency earlier this month, and on a Puerto Rican bomba rhythm that's allowed for traditional dancers to take the stage.

	From there, he bounced between songs from DeBÍ TiRAR MÁS FOTOS, like “KETU TeCRÉ” and the Christmas cut “PIToRRO DE COCO.” In between, little video snippets showed Concho the toad talking to Puerto Rican actor and filmmaker Jacobo Morales; both of them have been part of the album's storyline, with Morales playing an old man who has left home for a freezing cold, ice-filled new land and is constantly nostalgic for home. 


	One of the best transitions of the night happens when Concho and Morales are reminiscing about the beaches in Puerto Rico, paving the way for the Puerto Rico band and guests Chuwi to lead the beach-loving chorus of the song “Welita.” The traditional band Los Pleneros de la Cresta ends the section, giving the audience tons of plena.


	Also stunning is the range of the show: At one point, Bad Bunny pops up across the arena at a little pink house, known throughout the show as La Casita, and goes into raging house party mode, performing OG classics from his repertoire (like “Bichiyal” and “No Me Conoce”, plus some of the most charged tracks off DeBÍ TiRAR MÁS FOTOS. Here, the crowd absolutely lost it when Young Miko came out of La Casita for “Fina.” 


	Following that segment, Bad Bunny remerged on the mainstage, this time with a full salsa band for a sped-up version of “Callaíta,” and then his chart-topping salsa opus “BAILE INoLVIDABLE.” For one of the verses, salsa legend Gilberto Santa Rosa came out, sending the audience into absolute chaos. At 62, the salsa bandleader sounded sharp as ever, leaving fans with a rendition of “La Agarro Bajando” that left everyone screaming for an encore.

	Throughout the show, Bad Bunny reminded Puerto Ricans that so much of the magic of these shows comes directly from them (the first nine performances, save for some media invites, have been designed specifically for residents-only.) As the residency opens up to more tourists in later weeks, it's clear that the specific alchemy of Puerto Rico's spirit is going to be what creates once-in-a-lifetime experiences for attendees.

	The performance, yes, is undeniably powerful, but it's all mixed in with the energy and intimacy of being on the island and seeing so much of the experience behind the music firsthand. As the final thrum of “LA MuDANZA” piped into close the show, Bad Bunny reminded Puerto Ricans that this was possible because of them, and he's done this all for them. Parting words came from bandleader and percussionist Julito Gastón as he exited the stage: “Nunca paren de tocar su tambor.” “Never stop beating your own drum.”

	The French writer Gustave Flaubert famously warned, “You mustn't touch your idols; the gilt will come off on your hands.” The reverse is true, too. Pro wrestling legend Hulk Hogan, who died this past Thursday at the age of 71, left gold paint fingerprints all over the childhood memories of his fans.


	For Gen Xers, Hulk Hogan was a fantasy, like Batman or universal healthcare. In middle age, I see him for who he always was: a messy diva desperate for applause. But for a few years, as a boy, I was a Hulkamaniac, which is the closest I've ever come to joining a cult. Hulk Hogan was a vibe, a flamboyant, flesh-and-blood superhero who existed behind screens and inside imaginations. Eleven-year-old me mourns him. 


	Hogan was a cross between He-Man and David Lee Roth. His body was muscular and oily, his long, thin hair banana-yellow. He was graceful but beer-bellied. A living leather couch. 


	The only handlebar mustache I had ever seen before Hogan's was worn by a weathered ol' redneck who fed raw chickens to hungry alligators at a reptile farm in Orlando. I thought that dude was cool, and, to my kid brain, so was Hogan.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	When he spoke, he sounded like a locomotive powered by amphetamines. His trash talk was a kind of macho poetry — gibberish, really — every verse punctuated with “brother.” Hulk Hogan embodied everything America was about during the cheerfully sinister Reagan years: positivity, ass-kicking, feather boas.


	Professional wrestling wasn't just meatbags slapping meatbags. It was also a populist conversation about race, class, sexuality, and gender. The commentary isn't particularly deep, but the eternal struggle between “faces” (good guys) and “heels” (bad guys) has always reflected the country's political back-and-forth between in-groups and out-groups.

	











	Wrestling was both rife with offensive racial stereotypes and oddly woke, for lack of a better word. For instance, Hulk Hogan had a Saturday morning cartoon that I watched called Hulk Hogan's Rock ‘n Wrestling, and the assembled animated wrestlers were a diverse group of men, big and small, Black and white, Asian, Middle-Eastern, Latino, and… Scottish.

	My favorite professional wrestling bit from the World Wrestling Federation's Eighties heyday was Hogan's climactic move, which I loved more than George “the Animal” Steele's green tongue or Jake “the Snake” Roberts' tranquilized python. 


	It went like this: Near the end of his big matches, Hogan would sometimes find himself on his knees, nearly defeated, as some sneering heel put the screws to him. They'd twist his arm or stomp him in the chest. But then the cheers from his fans would begin, and Hogan would tremble with energy.


	He could hear us. He could hear me.


	The more I screamed in my living room, the more Hulk Hogan would fill with power until he was on his feet, and now, unstoppable. It wouldn't be long until he'd whip around and pin his opponent for the win. I felt like I was part of those victories. 


	I treated his famous catchphrase, a challenge to bad guys, as if it were a short prayer: “Whatcha gonna do when Hulkamania runs wild on you?” It was a legitimate question: What would they do, once the Hulk absorbed the collective life force of millions of hormonal teenage boys?


	His most famous gimmick was ripping a pre-ripped yellow shirt off his body, as if it were a feat of strength. But his ability to rise from the dead was miraculous. Even now, I gently smirk at the thought of that shtick — so silly, so pure.

	MY OLD MAN WOULD CHEER along with me, because make-believe is fun. He had told me, not long after Hogan's first Wrestlemania win in 1985 — the Super Bowl of wrestling — that wrestling was staged and rehearsed. Like a school play.


	I had deduced Santa wasn't real all on my own years before, but had failed to realize Hulk Hogan wasn't really locked in mortal combat with “Macho Man” Randy Savage. But this revelation didn't dull my enthusiasm when, in 1987, during one of his greatest championship matches, Hulk body-slammed seven-foot-tall, 500-pound Andre the Giant, with my help. It was a magnificent showstopper that left me thrilled.


	In 2005, I saw Hulk Hogan live at Madison Square Garden — for the first and only time in my life — during a rare appearance, in a match held three years after the World Wildlife Fund sued the World Wrestling Federation into changing its name to World Wrestling Entertainment. He was there to tease a future fight. When he strolled to the ring, the entire stadium, 10,000 dudes, all levitated. We screamed. We all knew this was bullshit. Hogan was an actor. Wrestling is a choreographed role-playing game.

	











	It was right that my dad would explain the truth to me. He had worked as a pro wrestling announcer in Juarez in the early 1960s, where he met my mom, a young Latina who was dragged to the matches by her father from El Paso. Or at least, that's the family lore.


	Dad had witnessed wrestling's various tricks of the trade up close, telling me that some of the wrestlers he worked with would hide little razor blades in their trunks and sneak a tiny cut under their hairline during a rehearsed scrum, which would trigger curtains of blood.


	He taught me that a wrestling punch was usually pulled, and mistakes were often made. But it was the reason for the punch that really sold the violence to the audience. They weren't watching the fist. Their eyes were focused on whoever was on the receiving end of the knuckle sandwich.


	My dad always stressed to me that the wrestlers he worked with were tough guys who needed work, or couldn't hold down traditional jobs. The way he described it sounded a bit like the circus, a safe space for misfits and ex-cons and other assorted brutes. The job welcomed all types, so long as you could growl, look mean, and not rage out if a piledriver went horribly wrong.


	He was very clear that the dramatic machinery of professional wrestling required two characters. A face and a heel. Someone to cheer, and someone to boo. 


	He explained the difference this way: Heels were cheaters. They were arrogant, too. And xenophobic. The most upstanding American virtue is hard work, but heels celebrate the easy way. A good face, meanwhile, is corny, but charged with testosterone. They should love all kids, regardless of race, religion, or gender. Faces are safe. 


	Hogan was possibly the greatest face in all of professional wrestling, But when his face era waned, he embraced being a villain, adopting a new persona: Hollywood Hogan.


	Whichever side he was on, Hogan was one of WWE impresario Vince McMahon's biggest draws. But his fame came at a price: two dozen or so surgeries, which included knee and hip replacements, and an admitted prescription-painkiller addiction. McMahon's beefcake empire was a well-documented sweatshop that exploited its often steroid-jacked talent, and it's a wonder Hogan made it out alive and lived as long as he did. Wrestlers don't typically grow old. 


	THE MAN I GREW UP WITH, whom I knew as Hulk Hogan, evolved over the decades, first into a reality TV star — Hogan Knows Best, where cameras followed him, wife Linda, daughter Brooke, and son Nick, ran for four seasons on VH1 in the mid-aughts — and then a right-wing lickspittle. 

	











	In between, Hogan's attempts to portray himself as a family man sputtered. In 2009, Linda, by then his ex-wife, accused him of infidelity and physical abuse (allegations he denied) in her memoir, Wrestling the Hulk: My Life Against the Ropes.In 2012, with the help of Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, Hogan sued the independent media site Gawker for publishing a sex tape of Hogan and the wife of his then-best friend, radio host Bubba the Love Sponge. It was a sordid affair, and Hogan's wealthy patron saw an opportunity: A jury awarded the wrestler $140 million for invasion of privacy, and Gawker, a blog famous for speaking snarky truth to power, filed for bankruptcy.  


	Also uncovered in that tape, and made public three years later: Hogan using racial slurs. (He was kicked out of the WWE's Hall of Fame for it in 2015, but then reinstated in 2018.) I had long since stopped following wrestling, but to hear him drop the n-word was heartbreaking. The Hulkster was just another small-town bigot. 


	Like many muscle-bound celebrities of his era, such as Sylvester Stallone, who cast him in a small role in 1982's Rocky III, Hogan morphed from an All-American crowd pleaser to a MAGA devotee. During the 2024 presidential election, he threw his support behind President Trump — a fellow WWE Hall of Famer as a longtime supporter of the sham sport and a politician who wears war paint and delights in bullying, much like any standard-issue wrestling baddie. Rather than summon the Hulkster's charms, he seemed content to perform for Fox News and its aging audience of faithful goons. 


	At the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Hogan attempted to resurrect his wrestling persona to appease a sea of devoted Trump supporters who were not there to cheer for him. It was a Faustian performance: a man selling his soul for cheap in exchange for a few minutes of “remember when” that anyone under the age of 45 never experienced in the first place.


	He praised Trump, whom he said he's known for 35 years. Called him a “real American hero” and one of the “baddest dudes on the planet.” Hogan seemed in good spirits. He played the hits. Ripped his tank top off. Underneath: a Trump-Vance T-shirt. And his big finish was sacrilege: “Whatcha gonna do when Donald Trump and all the Trumpamaniacs run wild on you, brother?!” 


	This was yet another nail in the coffin of his legacy. His years as a world-famous and universally beloved wrestler were now long gone, and in their place was an obsequious bronzer-dipped weasel. 


	In his final appearance as Hulk, during the Netflix premiere of WWE Monday Night Raw this past January, Hogan was booed by the crowd. On social media, news of his death was met with apathy and derision by younger people who never knew him as a champion, only as a right-wing punchline. 

	











	Hulk Hogan was born Terry Gene Bollea in Georgia and grew up in Florida. His wrestling career began in the 1970s, just as pro wrestling was shifting from a regional sideshow to a national television spectacle.


	I adored Hogan, but I've had to come to terms with an incontrovertible truth: Your childhood heroes were just people all along. And some of them are, and always were, the opposite of who you wanted them to be.

	Voters have increasingly little faith in the Democrats, a new Wall Street Journal poll found, with the party reaching its lowest favorability rating in more than three decades. Voters overwhelmingly believe that Republicans are better able to handle key issues in Congress than Democrats. 


	The survey found that the majority of voters, 63 percent, have an unfavorable view of the Democratic Party. Only 33 percent hold a favorable view. This is the most unpopular that Democrats have been according to Journal polls dating back to 1990. 


	As President Donald Trump enacts an increasingly authoritarian agenda and provides little economic benefit to the average American, Democrats are hopeful anti-Trump backlash will give them a strong showing in the 2026 midterm election. While slightly more people expect to vote for Democrats next year than Republicans, according to the Journal poll, Democrats' overall favorability has only dropped since Trump took office.  

	











	“The Democratic brand is so bad that they don't have the credibility to be a critic of Trump or the Republican Party,” John Anzalone, a Democratic pollster who worked on the survey, told the Journal. “Until they reconnect with real voters and working people on who they're for and what their economic message is, they're going to have problems.”


	Anzalone's firm, which consulted for both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaigns, worked on the survey with Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio.

	











	According to the survey, voters think Republicans in Congress are more capable at handling the economy, inflation and rising prices, tariffs, immigration, “illegal” immigration, the Russia-Ukraine war, and foreign policy. On the topic of “illegal” immigration, 48 percent have their faith in Republicans and 24 percent choose Democrats.


	Democrats scored higher on health care and vaccine policy. Both parties tied at 37 percent on the issue of looking out for middle class families.

	“As much as I fully believe that Democrats are not doomed for all eternity, I also believe that many Democrats aren't quite grappling with the serious credibility problems the party still faces,” Democratic operative Tré Easton posted on X. “The podcasts and everything are real cute, but we've got work to do.”


	Democrats also scored low in a Quinnipiac poll released earlier this month. In that survey, approval of congressional Democrats reached a new low of 19 percent, with 72 percent of voters saying they disapproved. 


	“This is a record low since March 2009 when the Quinnipiac University Poll first began asking this question of registered voters,” the university wrote. 


	The Quinnippiac poll found that even registered Democrats disapproved of the party: Thirty-nine percent approved of how Democrats in Congress were handling their jobs, while 52 percent disapproved. Among registered Republicans, 77 percent approved of how Republicans are operating in Congress.


	In the findings from the Journal, voters are mixed on Trump. About half, or 55 percent, of voters say the country is headed in the wrong direction. This is down from 70 percent in January, meaning voters have become more optimistic since Trump took office, yet Trump is not wildly popular. He has a favorability rating of 45 percent, and an unfavorability rating of 52 percent. A total of 46 percent approve of what Trump is doing as president, and 52 percent disapprove. Fifty-three percent disapprove of Trump's handling of the economy, while 44 percent approve.

	The Republican Party is not wildly popular either, though, with 54 percent of voters having an unfavorable view, compared to the 43 percent who have a favorable view.

Bad Bunny kicked off the third week of his Puerto Rican residency No Me Quiero Ir De Aqui with a show-stopping performance and two special guests: rising star Young Miko and salsa legend Gilberto Santa Rosa both came out to a roaring crowd and joined Benito onstage for a pair of songs.

Young Miko came out first, during a portion of the concert that takes place in a little pink house called La Casita. That part of the concert is designed to play out like a raging house party, with Miko popping out of the house to hop on the mic with Benito for their collab “Fina.” The two of them traded bars and danced around other house party guests (at past shows, that area has been filled with people like LeBron James, Ricky Martin, and Kylian Mbappé.)

	Every night of the residency ends with an energetic salsa showdown that includes Bad Bunny‘s No. 1 Hit “BAILE INoLVIDABLE.” The crowd broke out into screams when salsa legend Gilberto Santa Rosa strolled onstage unexpectedly to perform a verse of the song, and then stayed for a rendition of his classic “La Agarro Bajando.” Both stars emphasized the vibe of the setlist, which combines Puerto Rican traditions with modern sounds. It highlighted artists like Santa Rosa, who Bad Bunny has been a longtime fan of (the salsa veteran also just collaborated on a salsa song with J Balvin.)

	It's also a reminder of the rising stars Bad Bunny has long endorsed. Back in 2023, when Bad Bunny curated Rolling Stone's Future 25 list, he picked Young Miko as an artist to watch. “Young Miko is a new face that's breaking through, and I like her a lot,” he said at the time. ” I feel like she has so much to show people, like she hasn't showed people all her tricks yet.” Since then, Young Miko has become a massive breakout act, snagging a Latin Grammy nomination and acclaim for her debut album att., which came out last year.

NewsNation


Michael Ramsey 

(NewsNation) — Fears that crime cartels in Mexico may be invading the U.S. via fleets of surreptitious drones are probably overblown at this point, an expert on aerial phenomena says.

But former Pentagon insider and UFO researcher Luis Elizondo warns that federal officials must keep a close watch as drones become increasingly weaponized.

“This administration really needs to pay attention right now to the drone threat, especially along the southern border,” he told “CUOMO” on Friday.

Steven Willoughby, deputy director of the Department of Homeland Security's counter-drone program, this week told a Senate panel that more than 300 Mexican drones typically come within 500 meters of the U.S. border each day. Authorities believe transnational criminal organizations are using the remote-controlled devices to surveil U.S. law enforcement and find weak spots for smuggling.

Elizondo says cartels have long exploited emerging technology to penetrate border security, such as when organized drug criminals in the Amazon built submarines in an attempt to invade U.S. territorial waters.

“This is a normal escalation,” he said. “We should not be surprised at all with the proliferation of drone technology, that the cartels now in Mexico are using this technology to their advantage.”

Criminals have used drones to lethal effect in Mexico. Elizondo said such a development on the U.S. side of the border would not be a “far stretch.”

An eyewitness to the supposed crash-landing of a UFO in a small Pennsylvania town nearly 60 years ago now claims investigators have made new, startling discoveries about the incident. 

On December 9, 1965, people in seven US states and Canada reported seeing a giant fiery object lighting up the night sky.

Ronnie Strubel, 82, lived in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, at the time and described it as a 'fireball with a red rooster tail behind it'.

Contrary to more recent reports where witnesses claim UFOs they saw were unnaturally quick, Strubel told Daily Mail the object he saw was moving about as fast as a commercial airplane.

Then, he said, it came down in a wooded area in the unincorporated town of Kecksburg, which lies in Westmoreland County.

'It only took like 15 or 20 minutes for us to get out to the site, and the military was already there,' he said. 

But in the decades since, this strange event likely seen by thousands of people has largely been erased from the collective memory.

That is, until the History Channel aired a documentary on the subject earlier this month, where a mix of experts used modern technology to uncover what may have happened all those years ago in Kecksburg.

Many locals who claim to have seen the UFO pass over Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, say it looked like an acorn (Pictured: A model of the UFO is seen displayed in town)

Pictured: The History Channel team, alongside first-hand UFO witnesses Bill Weaver (second from right) and Ronnie Strubel (right), stand in the woods near the supposed crash site

Kecksburg is a small, unincorporated town in Westmoreland County. The nearest big city is Pittsburgh

The 42-minute long episode, titled 'Pennsylvania's Roswell', was part of reality TV series Beyond Skinwalker Ranch, a show that focuses on sites around the country where there has been supposed paranormal activity.

Strubel and another local, Bill Weaver, were featured in the episode. During a shot near the crash site, Strubel told the same story, but Weaver added some more context about the government response.

'The police and the military, they were all over the place. And there were guys out there in dark suits. They were the ones that seemed to be in charge,' Weaver said.

'While we were standing there watching what was going on, the state police and the military came up to us and they told us, ""If you don't move, we're going to confiscate your car."" And I figured I better move,' he added.

Hosts Andy Bustamante, an ex-CIA officer, and Paul Beban, an award-winning journalist, unpacked much of the lore surrounding the UFO sighting and crash.

This included the persisting claim from longtime residents that the object they saw was shaped like an acorn.

An acorn-like model of the alleged UFO has been sitting outside the Kecksburg Volunteer Fire Station since the 1990, when it was created as a prop for the NBC show 'Unsolved Mysteries.'

They also discussed many of the explanations that were thrown out by the federal government in the days, months and years after the incident.

Pictured: The very first Greensburg Tribune-Review article on the Kecksburg UFO incident, dated December 10, 1965

Pictured: The History Channel team did a LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) scan of the ground near where the UFO was thought to have crashed. Technologist Pete Kelsey claimed that this blue area was abnormally flat compared to the rest of the surrounding topography

The team then returned to that exact spot with handheld spectrum analyzers to measure the radio waves. The reading on the left was taken from the flat area discovered by the LiDAR, while the reading on the right was taken just 20 feet away

Very early reports quoted astronomers claiming it was merely a meteor, but this didn't hold much credibility because of the unprecedented military presence documented by witnesses and local media.

NASA still maintains that it was likely a meteor, but also acknowledges speculation that it could have been Soviet satellite.

Beban said the strangest thing about the case was that it got plenty of media attention at the time before it 'faded from view' under 'a cloak of secrecy'.

Bustamante and Beban turned to the expertise of technologist Pete Kelsey in hopes that he would be able to uncover the exact site of the UFO crash.

Kelsey used LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) imaging from a drone and slam scanner to get a topographic map of the ground, which would reveal possible impact points.

Later, the team gathered to look at the results of the scan and found what Kelsey called a patch of 'man-made earth work'.

'It's level against this otherwise very steep slope. Straight lines, right angles. Those kinds of things do not occur in nature,' he said.

They then returned to that exact spot with handheld spectrum analyzers to measure the radio waves.

Strubel revealed the findings at this past weekend's 20th annual Kecksburg UFO Festival, an event he founded with permission from the fire department in 2005

The alleged crash site had a vastly different radio signature than a spot just 20 feet away, which had a flat frequency.

'This doesn't make any sense. How is there a radio signal in one place that doesn't exist just a few feet away? That's not how radio energy works,' Bustamante said. 

'We're getting even more evidence that suggests that there really was something strange that happened on this spot, in this ravine, in Kecksburg,' he added. 'We might have actually found the real crash site.'

Strubel revealed these findings at this past weekend's 20th annual Kecksburg UFO Festival, an event he founded with permission from the fire department in 2005. 

Strubel himself is a 50-year veteran of the Kecksburg Volunteer Fire Department, once serving as chief.

The three-day festival routinely attracts thousands of visitors from all over the United States and the world as a whole, he told Daily Mail.

'We've had people from Japan, from Germany, from England with this little town event that we have,' he said.

The first two days of the festival were not solely dedicated to the extraterrestrial, with attendees enjoying a cornhole competition, a parade, fireworks and even a hotdog eating contest.

'Years ago, we used to have a street fair, and that went to the wayside. And this was our idea for some kind of event to draw a little bit of money into the community. So we started the UFO Fest,' Strubel said. 

It remains unclear what truly happened in Kecksburg six decades ago, but the mythos surrounding the UFO crash is clearly buoying the area to this day.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=extraterrestrial","Scientist Suggests Tests to See if Large Object Headed Toward Earth Could Be an Alien Spacecraft","https://futurism.com/tests-large-object-earth-alien-spacecraft","Sat, 26 Jul 2025 13:45:01 GMT","

Earlier this month, astronomers made a fascinating discovery: a mysterious object with interstellar origins, now dubbed 3I/ATLAS, that's hurtling toward the inner solar system at extreme speeds.

As scientists race to get a better understanding of the rare visitor — it's only the third confirmed interstellar object to have ventured into our solar system — some intriguing theories have emerged.

One particularly eyebrow-raising possibility beyond the mainstream suggestions of it being either a comet or an asteroid, as championed by Harvard astronomer and alien hunter Avi Loeb, is that 3I/ATLAS could have been sent by an intelligent, extraterrestrial civilization.

In a yet-to-be-peer-reviewed paper, Loeb analyzed the possibility that the object is ""alien technology,"" highlighting its unusual trajectory and what he says may be attempts to brake itself to have a closer look at Earth and Jupiter. (He also emphasized that it might just be a comet or space rock.)

""The orbital path of 3I/ATLAS has some very unlikely combination of characteristics, which could quite easily have been simple coincidence, as extremely strange as that ostensibly appears,"" the paper reads.

But Loeb — who previously wrote an entire book about the possibility that 'Oumuamua, an interstellar object first observed in 2017, may have been sent to us by an alien civilization — and his colleagues stopped far short of concluding the latest discovery was an alien probe. In the paper, they argued that ""this paper is largely a pedagogical exercise"" and that ""by far the most likely outcome will be that 3I/ATLAS is a completely natural interstellar object, probably a comet.""

As Swinburne University of Technology lecturer Sara Webb argued in a piece for The Conversation, the idea that the intriguing object could have an extraterrestrial origin is an intriguing hypothesis, and shouldn't be discarded.

""The idea of alien probes wandering the cosmos may sound strange, but humans sent out a few ourselves in the 1970s,"" Webb wrote, pointing out that ""both Voyager 1 and 2 have officially left our Solar System, and Pioneer 10 and 11 are not far behind.""

""So it's not a stretch to think that alien civilisations — if they exist — would have launched their own galactic explorers,"" she concluded.

However, figuring out whether 3I/ATLAS is indeed an alien probe coming to visit our system isn't nearly as easy as it sounds. According to Webb, we'd start out by checking if the object has a ""tail"" like comets do.

Other than that, we could ""look for signs of electrostatic discharge caused by sunlight hitting the probe"" or ""any kind of radio waves coming from the probe as a form of communication.""

But in the absence of any clear indications that 3I/ATLAS is an alien visitor, Webb agrees with Loeb that, as intriguing as the alternative may be, there's a very good chance we're looking at a comet: a celestial wad of ice, dust, and rock.

""For now, 3I/ATLAS is likely just an unusually fast, old and icy visitor from a distant system,"" Webb concluded. ""But it also serves as a test case: a chance to refine the way we search, observe and ask questions about the universe.""

When we think of alien life, our minds often wander to the realm of science fiction, envisioning little green beings with oversized heads. Yet, the reality might be far more intriguing and microscopic. NASA is funding a groundbreaking study to explore the possibility of alien microbial life within our solar system, specifically on Jupiter's icy moon, Europa. Led by UMass Amherst microbiologist James Holden, this mission delves into the depths of Earth's oceanic mysteries to better understand what life might look like on Europa.

James Holden brings a wealth of knowledge to NASA's mission, having dedicated his career to studying rare microbes in Earth's deep-sea vents. These vents, located a mile below the ocean's surface, offer a unique environment devoid of light and oxygen—conditions that Holden believes could mirror those on Europa. The hydrothermal vents on Earth are home to specialized microbes that derive energy from the gases and minerals spewed by volcanic activity. Holden's laboratory at UMass Amherst is equipped to simulate these harsh conditions, providing insights into how life might thrive on Europa.

Holden's research focuses on the potential for life-supporting conditions beneath Europa's icy crust. Astronomers speculate that a salty, liquid ocean lies beneath Europa's frozen surface and that this ocean might be in contact with a hot, molten core. This interaction could create an environment similar to Earth's deep-sea vents, where life might flourish. With NASA's Europa Clipper satellite set to explore the moon's habitability, Holden's work is crucial in understanding what alien life could look like.

“NASA Sounds the Alarm”: Unprecedented Planetary Surge Linked to Unknown Deep-Earth Force Now Spreading at Global Scale



For decades, Holden has utilized submarines to collect microbial samples from the ocean floor, both human-occupied and robotic. These samples are brought back to his lab, where he recreates the extreme conditions found at deep-sea vents. “I've been investigating deep-sea volcanoes since 1988,” Holden states, emphasizing his commitment to uncovering Earth's microbial secrets. By examining these microbes' adaptations, Holden hopes to draw parallels to potential life forms on Europa.

The significance of this research extends beyond mere curiosity. Understanding these microbes' energy acquisition methods could reveal new biochemical pathways, which might be present in Europan life. Holden's lab has reconstructed lightless, oxygen-less conditions that mimic those of Europa, offering a glimpse into what alien life might entail. The mission embodies the excitement of discovering life beyond Earth, potentially revealing secrets hidden in our own planet's depths.

“This Sensor Sees the Unseeable”: NASA's Quantum Gravity Tech Set to Revolutionize Earth Monitoring With Unmatched Precision



Holden's research also delves into the diverse chemical processes that might sustain Europan microbial life. On Earth, deep-sea microbes utilize hydrogenases—specialized enzymes that break down hydrogen for energy. However, the variability in hydrogenases' functions and interactions with elements like iron, sulfur, and carbon adds complexity to the study.

One of the challenges lies in understanding how these chemical processes contribute to an organism's physiology. The varied functions of hydrogenases in different microbial environments could result in significant differences in life forms. Holden's research aims to unravel these biochemical mysteries, shedding light on the potential diversity of life on Europa. By comprehending the chemistry that underpins these organisms, scientists can better predict what alien life might resemble.

“These Creatures Could Rewrite the Rules of Life”: Deep-Sea Microbes on Earth Mirror What May Be Thriving Beneath Europa's Ice



As NASA's Europa Clipper embarks on its mission to assess Europa's habitability, Holden's research remains vital in guiding the exploration. The study of Earth's deep-sea vents provides a window into the potential for life in extraterrestrial environments. By understanding the conditions that support life on our planet, scientists can make educated assumptions about the possibilities elsewhere in our solar system.

Holden's work not only expands our knowledge of Earth's microbial diversity but also fuels the quest for discovering life beyond our world. The $621,000 NASA grant underscores the importance of this research, as it paves the way for understanding how life could survive in alien chemistries. As we stand on the brink of potentially uncovering life on Europa, one must wonder: What secrets do our own planet's depths hold, and what could they reveal about life in the universe?

Wow, $621k seems like a lot! Is it really worth it? 🤔

Thanks for the article! Fascinating to think life might exist on Europa.

Is this the best use of taxpayer money? What about issues on Earth?

As a sci-fi fan, I'm all for exploring Europa! 🚀

Why Europa and not another moon or planet?

Great article! Keep up the good work! 👍

Can microbes really survive in such extreme conditions?

Why aren't we funding more studies like this? The possibilities are endless!

Isn't this just a waste of time and resources? 🤨

The idea of alien life is thrilling. Go NASA! 🌌

	“The Boys” couldn't let “Gen V” have all the fun at San Diego Comic Con.


	At the very end of the “Gen V” Season 2 panel on Friday afternoon, the upcoming fifth and final season of “The Boys” showed its very first teaser to the crowd of attendees in Ballroom 20. It was a brief teaser, packed with tons of superhero violence and gore — as fans of “The Boys” have come to expect — and quick looks at the new and returning cast members.

	The action unfolded quickly, but a couple of the highlights included a new supe character vomiting up what appeared to be a bloody hairball onto another character and someone having what could only be described as a violent explosion in a bathroom stall.

	










			Popular on Variety		







	Seth Rogen, who's an executive producer on “The Boys” and has appeared in a handful of cameos across the previous seasons, also made an appearance in the teaser. As did newcomers Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins, who are both playing unknown characters. Both actors appeared in a blink-or-you-miss-it scene together, in what's the latest “Supernatural” reunion on “The Boys.” Showrunner Eric Kripke was also the creator of the beloved CW series and had already cast “Supernatural” stars Jensen Ackles, as the Captain America-like antihero Soldier Boy, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, as Joe Kessler, on “The Boys.” “Supernatural” fans had been begging Kripke to bring more of their faves to the Prime Video superhero show, and now their wishes have been granted.


	The most memorable part of the teaser was a powerful declaration by Antony Starr's Homelander, in which he bellows how “this is a safer, more god-fearing nation” to an unseen crowd. At the end of Season 4, Homelander essentially worked his way into the White House and is the real power behind the new U.S. president. The country is under martial law, and Homelander has rounded up the Boys and other supes who don't want to “make America super again.”

	











	In the quick teaser, at least one “Gen V” cast member was spotted: London Thor as Godolkin University student Jordan Li. That makes sense, as “Gen V” stars Maddie Phillips and Asa Germann appeared in “The Boys” Season 4 finale as pro-Homelander enforcers who turned on their fellow classmates and former friends. The “Gen V” and “The Boys” cross-show synergy continues with Erin Moriarty and Chace Crawford appearing in “Gen V” Season 2, coming this fall.


	Many of “The Boys” alum are returning for the final season, in addition to the aforementioned actors: Jack Quaid, Karl Urban, Jessie T. Usher, Tomer Capone, Karen Fukuhara, Laz Alonso, Nathan Mitchell, Colby Minifie, Cameron Crovetti, Susan Heyward, Valorie Curry and more. New faces coming in Season 5 include Daveed Diggs and Paul Reiser. Season 5 will release some time in 2026.

Over the course of 15 seasons and 327 episodes, Sam and Dean Winchester (Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles) saved people, hunted things (the family business), saved the world more than a few times, didn't always succeed in saving each other, lost countless loved ones along the way, and stepped out of the box for several could-only-happen-on-Supernatural installments.

This year marks the 20th anniversary of the WB-turned-CW series that is just as beloved now — maybe even more so, with fans still streaming hours of it and attending conventions around the world — as it was when it first premiered on September 13, 2005. In honor of that, we've ranked our 20 favorite episodes of the series below.

Meet fan-favorite Charlie Bradbury (Felicia Day), a lesbian hacker and J.R.R. Tolkien fanatic looking to go on her own quest. In her Season 7 introduction, Dean is begrudgingly charmed by Charlie and hilariously teaches the awkward nerd how to flirt her way into the office of big bad Dick Roman (James Patrick Stuart). It's a breath of fresh air in the middle of Season 7's lengthy Leviathans storyline, which follows the ancient entity looking to take over the world. This episode also features ghost Bobby (Jim Beaver), and it's devastating to watch the apparition version of Sam and Dean's father figure spiral into a vengeful spirit. Overall, this installment is a great mix of what Supernatural does best: silly moments with Charlie balanced with the emotional weight of Bobby, and a continued twisty, otherworldly plot. —Leah Williams

This Halloween episode really hits the nail on the coffin for the monster-of-the-week series. “Monster Movie”—which is sometimes divisive among fans (is it cheesy or awesome?)—sees the Winchesters searching for a break from all the epic angel-demon apocalypse drama. The brothers end up in a small town that is being terrorized by a murderer who may or may not be a vampire—or a werewolf or a mummy. They discover that the creepy culprit is actually a shape-shifting demon named Lucy (played by Holly Elissa Dignard, whose character's name is also a nod to Bram Stoker's Dracula). As Dean says, “You think this Dracula can turn into a bat? That'd be cool!” It's a wonderful homage to black-and-white monster flicks, and it's a welcome bit of levity amid a season where fans are left questioning what happened to Dean during his time in Hell. —Giulia Campora

This Bobby-centric episode follows a few days in the life of Beaver's beloved hunter. Usually, Bobby is the one who helps everyone—with research, pretending to be FBI to verify a fake identity and burying monster bodies with his friend Rufus (Steven Williams); this time, the brothers need to be there for him. Why? Bobby sold his soul to Crowley (Mark Sheppard) during their attempt to stop the Apocalypse, and now the demon doesn't want to make good on giving it back (always read the fine print). Bobby finally has enough, and tears into Sam and Dean: “I do everything for you,” he says. “How about you two sack up and help me for once?” All he had to do was ask. This episode also reveals why Crowley sold his soul in the first place to become a demon. —Meredith Jacobs

It's in Season 4 that Chuck (Rob Benedict) is introduced as a prophet who has written books detailing the brothers' lives (see No. 10). But it's not until this episode, which aired seven years later, that the show confirmed a long-held fan theory that Chuck is really God. There are some great moments here, from his celestial reveal (complete with a bright light and chorus singing) in front of the angel Metatron (Curtis Armstrong) to the different (and wrathful) sides he shows. But the real emotional payoff in this episode is down on Earth. Dean finds the amulet that Sam gave him as a kid—which Dean threw out years prior—glowing in his brother's pocket (God can turn its ability to track him on and off), and it leads them right to Chuck. “We should probably talk,” he admits to the brothers. It is both an understatement and a great way to close out the episode. —MJ

In the brothers' battle against the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, Dean's standoff with Death (a brilliant Julian Richings) in the fifth season's penultimate episode is the standout moment of the entire arc. As Dean meets with Death in a Chicago pizzeria (thanks to Bobby, who sold his soul to Crowley for the intel), the moment is not only tense—bodies are slumped on the tables around them!—but also a fun twist on the battle scenes with the other Horsemen we've seen up to this point. And Death really packs a wallop for the heroic Dean. “This is one little planet in one tiny solar system, in a galaxy that's barely out of its diapers,” Death informs him. “I'm old, Dean. Very old. So, I invite you to contemplate how insignificant I find you.” Death later decides to spare Chicago because he likes the pizza. Good call. —Emily Aslanian

The penultimate season gave fans a moment that it seemed the show never could (or would): the Winchester family all together. The brothers' mother, Mary (Samantha Smith), had been killed—burned on the ceiling of Sam's nursery—by the demon Azazel (Fredric Lehne) in 1983, and their father, John (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), died when he sold his soul to save Dean in Season 2. But Mary is brought back by God's sister Amara (Emily Swallow) in Season 11, and in this episode, a pearl that grants wishes plucks John out of 2003. It's a bittersweet reunion for the family that keeps having to say goodbye to one another (later, they must destroy the pearl and send John back), though it does allow for some long-overdue moments, including a heart-to-heart between John and younger son Sam, who never saw eye to eye. —MJ

The first season caps off with the introduction of Beaver's Bobby, the brother's father figure who schools them on demonic possessions, before a brutal finale-ending car crash involving Sam, Dean and their dad, John. But what makes this episode stand out is the brothers' face-off with John: He is possessed by Azazel, the demon who killed Mary. John-as-Azazel taunts Sam about his psychic powers and his plans for him, and hits Dean where it hurts the most: “You fight and you fight for this family, but the truth is, they don't need you, not like you need them.” How can you forget Dean begging his dad not to let Azazel kill him as the demon hurts him? Then there's Sam, once armed with their supernatural-killing revolver, the Colt, unable to kill John (despite his father's telling him to), which allows the demon to escape. —MJ

Over the years, Supernatural has had quite a few meta episodes, tributes and homages to other genres, and even fans. The milestone 200th episode sees a regular monster hunt bring Sam and Dean to a high school where the drama department is putting on a musical based on their lives (and inspired by Chuck's books). The brothers get a firsthand look at how others might see them. The songs are catchy, from “The Road So Far” (their origin story) to “A Single Man Tear” (about Dean, of course), “I'll Just Wait Here Then” (about the often left-behind angel Castiel) to a cover of Kansas‘ “Carry On Wayward Son,” a staple of the series. There's even a mention of Sam and Dean's half brother Adam Milligan (Jake Abel), who spends a majority of the show trapped in a cage in Hell, and a surprise return from Benedict's Chuck, who arrives to give his review. Our take? It's outstandingly fun. —MJ

“We do the same thing. We go to spooky places. We solve mysteries. We fight ghosts,” Dean says of the Winchesters and the Scooby gang. When it‘s put that way, it feels like this silly crossover should‘ve happened sooner. Sam and Dean, during a hunt, are animated and transported into the world of Scooby-Doo. What ensues is a team-up to solve a mystery, Dean hitting on Daphne, Velma crushing on Sam and all the classic moments (the chase! the music!) you‘d expect from an episode of Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! (specifically, “A Night of Fright Is No Delight”). But when it becomes clear they‘re hunting a real ghost, Sam and Dean fill the Scooby gang in on the truth, that they‘re in a TV cartoon. The episode even ends with the villain‘s classic “meddling kids” line and the “Scooby-Dooby-Doo” catchphrase…said by Dean. —MJ 

This early episode is Supernatural‘s take on the 1993 comedy Groundhog Day, with Sam stuck in a time loop as he watches Dean die again and again. It all kicks off when the brothers investigate a man who has disappeared in a tourist spot, and Dean is shot and killed by the owner. The following day, Sam wakes up in the motel next to his brother again. There is some humor to Dean's ongoing deaths (“Do these tacos taste funny to you?” Dean asks before one of them), and the return of the Trickster (Richard Speight Jr.) adds a nice element. Plus, the focus on the brothers‘ bond makes this one of the most unforgettable episodes of the series. But even when it's over, it's still painful for Sam and Dean to return to reality as the clock continues to tick down on Dean‘s deal after he sold his soul to save Sam. —MJ

Imagine you think that you have free will, only to discover that someone out there has been writing your story the entire time. That's what happens to Sam and Dean in this memorable installment, when they discover the Supernatural book series written by Carver Edlund (Rob Benedict), the pen name for Chuck Shurley and later…God. And not only is Chuck writing and publishing every twist and turn the guys have experienced in the last four years—the books also have a cult following with an online fandom that meets up at conventions. (Sound familiar?) “Well, there's only one explanation,” Chuck tells the guys. “Obviously, I'm a god.” Even though that was not the initial plan for his character, it's a nice bit of foreshadowing for the series' final big bad. —EA

Ask fans to quote Supernatural, and chances are “Family don't end with blood” will come up near the top of the list. That iconic line is from this episode, when Sam and Dean try to leave Bobby behind while they confront Lilith, who holds Dean's deal that will send him to Hell in mere hours. Lilith has possessed a young girl (Sierra McCormick) and is torturing her family. Sam's ready to do whatever it takes to save his brother, just one of many instances across the years that show what Dean tells him: They're each other's weak spots, and evil will use that against them. There's only a brief reprieve for the Winchesters—singing along to Bon Jovi‘s “Wanted Dead or Alive”—before reality comes knocking. Sam's unable to do anything but plead, voice hoarse, as Dean is ripped apart by hellhounds, then cry as he holds his dead brother. The image of Dean actually in Hell to end the season? Chilling. —MJ

There might not be any death here, but this is easily one of the most heartbreaking episodes in the series. Sam and Dean are hunting a djinn—a genie that can produce hallucinations—and Dean is zapped into his dream world. In it, his mother, Mary, never died; his father, John, never became a hunter; Sam is in law school and his girlfriend Jess (Adrianne Palicki) is alive; Dean is dating the beautiful Carmen Porter (Michelle Borth) and Dean's life is as average as you can imagine. It should be blissful for the tortured hunter, but Dean soon realizes that in this world, everyone the brothers have ever saved is dead, and he and Sam don't get along. Soon, Dean knows that none of it is real and that the djinn is slowly killing him. It's agonizing to watch Dean get what he's always wanted, but slightly to the left. His bittersweet return to reality is genuinely moving. —LW

Supernatural loves an alt-universe episode, and here, fans got a really entertaining one with a double dose of Dean. The angel Zachariah (Kurt Fuller) shows Dean a bleak look at what life will look like in 2014—five years into his future—if he doesn't say yes to being the archangel Michael's human vessel. With the world overrun by the Croatoan virus (which essentially turns people into zombies), future Dean leads a compound as he searches for the Colt. Castiel has been stripped of his grace and is now painfully human. (Collins plays him hilariously as a hippie cult leader.) Sam, meanwhile, is totally gone and possessed by Lucifer. He's smooth and terrifying in his white suit, mocking Dean. But the best part of “The End” is getting twice the usual amount of Dean. Ackles deftly plays both 2009 Dean and 2014 Dean as they butt heads throughout the episode and argue over how best to save the world. —LW

The back half of the two-part second-season finale opened with a devastated Dean and a dead Sam. Oh, and the end of the world is looming. (“Let it end!” yells Dean, and we feel his pain.) Unsurprisingly, Dean can‘t let Sammy stay dead for long, and he summons a demon to make a deal—a really terrible deal. Dean is given one year left to live, and then his soul goes to Hell. Sam is revived—and immediately suspicious about how he survived—and the brothers go right back to business, joining up with Bobby and fellow hunter Ellen Harvelle (Samantha Ferris) in the quest to take down Azazel. The showdown is set in a graveyard as the gates of Hell are thrown open, but the final blow is not dealt by Sam or Dean. The spirit of their father, John, arrives to avenge Mary‘s death. Later, Dean tells Sam the truth about his regeneration in a tender moment. —EA 

Welcome, Castiel! The angel‘s epic introduction in this episode is possibly the best in the series. Dean appears back on Earth after his time in Hell, having no idea how he got there. He, Sam and Bobby spend much of the episode trying to figure out how he escaped. Dean assumes someone nefarious yanked him out. Surely, this was the work of a demon. In the final minutes, Castiel appears to Dean and Bobby in an abandoned barn, shattering light bulbs and casting giant wing shadows on the walls. He reveals himself to be the one who “gripped [Dean] tight and raised [him] from perdition.” Castiel ultimately becomes the show‘s third lead, and we're better for it. Plus, the major addition of angels to the already demon-heavy series permanently changes the course of Supernatural‘s story. —LW

Thanks to the return of the Trickster, Sam and Dean are dropped into TV show parodies of Grey's Anatomy (Dr. Sexy, M.D.), CSI: Miami (with a pithy one-liner, à la David Caruso‘s Horatio Caine), a Japanese game show, a sitcom, an advertisement for genital herpes medication and Knight Rider—complete with Sam in the Impala as KITT. Castiel tries and fails to rescue them. It's one of the series' funniest episodes, and while it does feel like a meta sidestep away from the larger plot, this isn't filler. In fact, there's a massive reveal: The Trickster is really the archangel Gabriel! —MJ

No other show can do an episode from the point of view of a car and have it be so emotionally charged. But Baby, their 1967 Chevrolet Impala, is the brothers‘ home—and Sam says just that to close out the installment. Besides the brilliant cinematography—most of the episode takes place inside the car—this standout also has all the makings of a classic: a monster-of-the-week hunt (“ghoul-pires,” Dean calls them) with fights that feel more chaotic in the constraints of the Impala, teasing between the brothers (Dean puts on Bob Seger's “Night Moves” after Sam hooks up in the backseat) and new mythology regarding the Darkness (Emily Swallow). There are even admissions from Sam and Dean that they both dream of normal lives with their parents, plus one of their quintessential “Jerk”/“Bitch” exchanges. It feels like an old-school Supernatural episode in all the best ways. —MJ

It's the ultimate meta episode: Sam and Dean find themselves on a television set in an alt-reality where they're Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, stars of a TV show that mirrors what's happening in the hunter brothers' lives. It's a tribute to Supernatural that such a bizarrely hilarious episode is right in line with the show. The dialogue is great, and fans received so many Easter eggs to enjoy: tongue-in-cheek comments about ratings, Jared being married to “fake Ruby” (Padalecki met his real-life wife, Genevieve Padalecki, who guest stars here, when she played the demon), “Misha Collins” tweeting and a clip of Ackles on Days of Our Lives. There are some particularly over-the-top moments too, as Sam and Dean make terrible attempts at acting, and we see Jensen's trailer with a giant fish tank and Jared's backyard alpaca. “Why would anybody want to watch our lives?” Dean asks. The answer is simple: for episodes like this. —MJ

The plan in this episode—originally intended to be the series' finale—is for Sam to become Lucifer's vessel, jump into Hell and trap him in the cage. Other shows would find a way around that dangerous situation for one half of the show's leads. Not Supernatural. The action is framed by Chuck telling the story of how the Impala became the Winchesters'. And Baby is there as Dean reluctantly agrees to Sam's plan. Sam makes him promise not to try to bring him back and instead “live some normal, apple pie life” as he drinks demon blood and says yes to Lucifer for the showdown between Lucifer (in Sam's body) and Michael (in their half brother Adam's body). “I ain't gonna let him die alone,” Dean decides before he's beaten to a pulp by a possessed Sam. It's seeing the Impala that allows Sam to remember Dean, regain control—and take Lucifer and Michael to Hell. Chuck vanishes, but not before a jaw-dropping hint that he's God. And it all ends on a cliffhanger time-jump: Sam, back from Hell, watching Dean trying to live that normal life. Filled with edge-of-your-seat moments and deeply emotional scenes between the brothers, this one is simply everything a great Supernatural episode can be. —MJ

In the Hulu drama, Brown and Ernest Kingsley Jr. shed new light on the slave narrative by way of a gifted young boy's thrilling life.

False claim that Brigitte Macron was born a man has roots in pandemic-era France as distrust of politicians peaked

When the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and his wife, Brigitte, took the rare step this week of filing a US defamation lawsuit against the rightwing podcaster Candace Owens, it marked a new phase in a legal battle on both sides of the Atlantic against the false claim that Brigitte Macron is a man named Jean-Michel Trogneux.

The Macrons' US lawsuit attacked what it called the “verifiably false and devastating lies” being repeated online by Owens that Brigitte Macron, 72, was born a man. The lawsuit said evidence clearly disproved this “grotesque narrative”, which had become “a campaign of global humiliation” and “relentless bullying on a worldwide scale”.

The case prompted broader questions this week about how conspiracy theories spread worldwide, whether they can be stopped in the courts and what this false narrative, which began in France after the Covid pandemic, says about French society's distrust in politicians.

“This is now one of the biggest fake news stories worldwide in terms of popularity – a billion people have seen it,” said Emmanuelle Anizon, a senior journalist for the French weekly Nouvel Obs, who last year published a book, L'Affaire Madame, investigating the origins of the rumour in France. “What's new is that for the first time, Emmanuel Macron has joined his wife in taking legal action.”

The Macrons' US lawsuit states the accusation that Brigitte Macron was born a man named Jean-Michel Trogneux is completely false and Trogneux is in fact is her older brother. Trogneux, 80, lives in the northern French town of Amiens, where he grew up with Brigitte and four other siblings in a family famous for its local chocolate business. He was present in public alongside his Brigitte at Emmanuel Macron's two presidential inaugurations in 2017 and 2022.

Owens, whose podcast and social media channels have an audience of millions, said this week she stood by her narrative.

The false claim that Brigitte was a man first went viral in France in 2021, at a moment when distrust of politicians in was at a high, after the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) anti-government protest movement and the Covid pandemic that killed more than 130,000 people in France.

In December 2021, a woman who used the name Amandine Roy and called herself a “spiritual medium”, broadcast a four-hour YouTube interview with Natacha Rey, 51, who had worked previously for a small essential oils business and described herself as “an independent investigative journalist, self-taught, and not from the inner circle of mainstream media”.

Rey said she had spent three years investigating Brigitte Macron, after questioning the first lady's body-shape in photos. Rey said she believed Brigitte Macron was actually a man called Jean-Michel Trogneux. Within hours, the interview had 500,000 views and the hashtag #Jean-MichelTrogneux was trending on social media in France, promoted by, among others, some far-right and anti-vaccine accounts. A small far-right newsletter had already published Rey's theories but it was the video interview that sent the claim viral.

“There was a deeper societal problem at that time in France: the mistrust of political, media and economic institutions,” Anizon said. “There had been years of political health scandals worldwide and in France – from a contaminated blood scandal to the Mediator weight-loss drug. Many people had gradually reached a point of distrust, switching off traditional mainstream media and turning instead to online accounts – Covid and vaccine mistrust increased that.”

The rumour spread in part because the Macrons' relationship had long been a topic of comment online. Brigitte Macron, who is 24 years older, first met Emmanuel Macron when she was a French teacher at his Jesuit secondary school in Amiens, directing him in a school play.

The Macrons' US lawsuit this week stated: “Through the school's theatre programme, president Macron and Mrs Macron formed a deeper intellectual connection.” It added: “At all times the teacher-student relationship between Mrs Macron and President Macron remained within the bounds of the law.” Brigitte Macron, who has three children from her first marriage, divorced in 2006 and she and Emmanuel Macron married the following year when he was 30.

In early 2022, after the first viral video allegations, Brigitte Macron and her brother, Jean-Michel Trogneux, filed a defamation case in France against Roy and Rey, who both denied wrongdoing.

In September 2024, a Paris court found the two women guilty and ordered them to pay €8,000 in damages to Brigitte Macron and €5,000 in damages to Jean-Michel Trogneux.

The women appealed against the verdict and, this month, they were acquitted by a Paris appeals court. The appeal court verdict did not imply that the claims that Brigitte Macron was a man were true, but instead judges ruled that the case against the women did not fit the definition of defamation.

Brigitte Macron and Jean-Michel Trogneux have taken the case to France's highest appeals court, the cour de cassation. Brigitte Macron has filed a separate case for online harassment and 10 people will go on trial in Paris in October.

Each time the Macrons' relationship is in the spotlight, the false allegations about gender spread again online. This was the case in May, when video images appeared to show Brigitte pushing her husband away with both hands on his face before they disembarked from a plane on a tour of Southeast Asia. Macron dismissed the incident as play-fighting, telling reporters that “we are squabbling and, rather, joking with my wife”, and that it had been overblown into “a sort of geo-planetary catastrophe”.

Brigitte Macron has not spoken publicly on the false gender claims since 2022 when she told French radio, RTL, that allegations that “I am my brother” were an “impossible” attack on her parents' family tree. She told TF1 TV at the time she wanted to set an example so other people would not suffer in the same way. She said fighting online bullying “is my battle”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","other"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Unsolved+Mysteries","Jimmy Hoffa's disappearance remains among America's most infamous, unsolved mysteries — but there's a new theory","https://nypost.com/2025/07/26/us-news/jimmy-hoffas-disappearance-remains-among-americas-most-infamous-unsolved-mysteries-but-theres-a-new-theory/","Sat, 26 Jul 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

It's been 50 years since Jimmy Hoffa first disappeared, and his case remains one of the most infamous and vexing unsolved mysteries in U.S. history.

The ex-Teamsters boss left his cottage home in suburban Lake Orion, Mich., near Detroit on July 30, 1975 for a 2 p.m. meeting at the Machus Red Fox Restaurant in nearby Bloomfield Hills.

He was reportedly gathering with a group of gangsters, including Anthony “Tony Pro” Provenzano, a New Jersey-based capo for the Genovese crime family, and Detroit mob boss Anthony “Tony Jack” Giacalone. Hoffa was trying to regain control of the union after stepping down as its leader four years earlier — and the mob wanted no part of that since it meant they'd lose access to the the Teamster's lucrative pension fund.

At around 2:15 p.m., Hoffa, 62,  called his wife, Josephine, from the restaurant's parking lot to tell her no one showed up. It was the last time anyone ever heard from him.  

He was officially declared dead seven years later, but the whereabouts of his remains have baffled the FBI ever since.

Over the past five decades, the agency has assigned hundreds of agents to the case who've debunked conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory – while costing taxpayers tens of millions of dollars, estimated Hoffa historian and author Scott Burnstein.

The case also spawned more than 20 books, multiple movies and documentaries – and a cottage industry of investigative journalists, amateur sleuths and former wise guys claiming to know what really happened.

Just this week a new theory emerged — that Hoffa's corpse was literally turned into mincemeat, The Post can reveal. 

Burnstein — who believes the hit on Hoffa was carried out by Detroit's Tocco–Zerilli crime family — said the case's mythology took on a life of its own because  remains were never found.

“This was something they thought was a perfect crime – and in a lot of ways it was the perfect crime,” he told The Post, referring to the crime syndicate also known as “Detroit Partnership.” “I just don't think they anticipated people would still be talking about it 50 years later, and this is a mob family that thrives in the shadows. They like being stealth.

“They're not a New York-type family or Chicago-type family or Philadelphia-type family that really covets the press.”

On Wednesday, Burnstein teamed up with former federal prosecutor Richard Convertino and ex-mob soldier Nove Tocco at an event at Macomb Community College in Warren, Mich., to reveal the latest theory to surface about what happened to Hoffa.

They claimed Hoffa was whacked by late Detroit mobster Anthony “Tony Pal” Palazzolo — and the body ground up in a sausage grinder at the former Detroit Sausage Company Palazzolo used for his operations.

The remaining pieces were then dumped in an incinerator of a mob-owned waste disposal business in nearby Hamtramck, Mich., that was destroyed in an arson fire eight months later, the trio claimed. The site is now part of a local jail complex.

Other popular theories about Hoffa's demise include: 

Dan Moldea, a 75-year-old journalist and author of “The Hoffa Wars” who has written extensively about the case since the ex-Teamster boss went missing, spurred one of the most recent searches for Hoffa in 2021 by providing the feds information he secured from multiple mob sources.

Moldea told the FBI he believed Hoffa was buried in a steel drum in an alcove under the Pulaski Skyway, near the site of a former Jersey City landfill.

Before the FBI began its search, Moldea and Fox News contracted teams of investigators to use ground-penetrating radar to check for anomalies under the site, such as steel drums. Both tests flagged possible evidence, he said.

The scans were then provided to the FBI's Detroit Field Office, but Moldea said that office never shared the information with the FBI's Newark Field Office — and he believes this led to the feds digging in the wrong spot a mere 10 yards away and coming up empty.

“We spoon-fed them this information, so it was tragic the way the whole thing worked out,” Moldea told The Post.

He wants to re-examine the suspected burial site, which is now owned by the New Jersey Department of Transportation, but said he's been blocked because the agency claims the area is currently an active work zone for overhead construction on the highway.

Burnstein said he has great respect for Moldea's work but believes the murder and body disposal was done locally — not out of state.

“I think people are making this way more complex than it actually was,” Bernstein said. “This was a job done by the Detroit mob, and it was probably done within a half hour or 45 minutes.”

Besides Hoffa's bid to reclaim the Teamsters' presidency — a title he held from 1959 to 1971 —  Burnstein said his sources told him there's another reason mobsters wanted Hoffa dead: He was a “confidential informant working for the FBI.”

“The rumors were starting to spread on the street in the spring of 75,” he said.

The FBI said the case remains active but declined to answer questions.

“As the 50th anniversary of Mr. Hoffa's disappearance approaches, the FBI Detroit Field Office remains steadfast in its commitment to pursuing all credible leads,” said Cheyvoryea Gibson, the office's Special Agent in Charge. 

“We continue to encourage anyone with information to submit a tip at tips.fbi.gov or call 1-800-CALL-FBI.”

James P. Hoffa, son of the late Teamsters boss, told the Detroit News he doesn't buy that his father's remains were taken out of state, and he denied that his father planned to testify for the feds. 

He's proud of the “legacy” his father left behind, but regrets the disappearance became comedy fodder for late-night television and that his mother died in 1980 with a “broken heart.”

“My father went to a meeting he shouldn't have gone to, and he was murdered,” said the younger Hoffa, 84, who served as Teamsters president from 1998-2022. “I know there are a lot of theories out there, but we've stopped trying to figure out who did what to whom.

“This is a tragedy our family has had to live with, and we're still hoping to have closure someday.”

Nathan Albers will profit again — his Disaster Management Group is contracted to build the US's largest detention camp.

On Monday, the Department of Defense announced that it had awarded a massive new contract to build the nation's largest migrant detention camp on the Fort Bliss military base, a facility that will play a key role in the Trump administration's deportation plans.

Unmentioned was that one of the subcontractors slated to work on the project, Disaster Management Group, is owned by Nathan Albers, who previously co-owned a company that pleaded guilty in 2019 to a scheme to hire undocumented workers and conceal them from immigration authorities. Albers is a big-time Republican donor who has spent time at Mar-a-Lago.

Two people with direct knowledge of the award and two familiar with the company told ProPublica that Disaster Management Group would help build the new facility, receiving a substantial chunk of the more than $1.2 billion the government has allocated for the project.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

“The idea that you could use illegal labor and then sell services to ICE, the irony is thick,” said Scott Shuchart, a former official with the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement during President Donald Trump's first term and later under President Joe Biden, referring to the immigration case involving TentLogix, the company Albers once co-owned.

In response to questions from ProPublica, a spokesperson for Disaster Management said that Albers and Disaster Management had been dropped from the DHS' investigation of TentLogix and exonerated. Upon learning of illegal actions by TentLogix's co-founder, the spokesperson said, “Mr. Albers parted ways as a minority and non-operating owner of TentLogix.”

The spokesperson didn't directly answer questions about Disaster Management's role in the detention camp at Fort Bliss, saying only that the company “is proud to support projects of national importance for nearly 20 years.”

The White House didn't answer questions about Disaster Management or Albers, referring ProPublica to the DOD and DHS, neither of which provided comment.

The new migrant detention camp near El Paso, Texas, is expected to hold up to 5,000 people. The prime contractor is Virginia-based Acquisition Logistics, and people with direct knowledge of the work at Fort Bliss told ProPublica that Amentum, a major engineering and technology services contractor, will be another subcontractor.

Neither Acquisition Logistics nor Amentum replied to questions from ProPublica about the project.

Disaster Management specializes in building temporary structures. Since 2020, it's won over $500 million in government contracting work, mostly to construct lodgings for a U.S. program to resettle Afghan refugees.

Last year, the Department of Labor announced that it had found Disaster Management and subcontractors it worked with on the Afghan refugee contract violated federal labor laws, including those on minimum wages and overtime. The agency recovered nearly $16 million in pay for workers, and Disaster Management signed a compliance agreement with the agency designed to prevent further violations. The company didn't respond to questions about the case.

Albers' ties to TentLogix wouldn't have excluded him or Disaster Management from other government contracting work, explained Scott Amey, the general counsel at the Project On Government Oversight.

TentLogix reported its criminal conviction in the federal contracting database, but Albers and his other businesses are considered separate legal entities. Companies awarded federal contracts are required to certify that they operate with a satisfactory record of business ethics, but “a lot of things are not required to be reported,” Amey said. “I don't even think this would appear on the radar of a contracting officer.”

Still, there's a web of connections between TentLogix and Disaster Management. Albers was one of TentLogix's two directors when it pleaded guilty to violating immigration law. The other, Gary Hendry, co-founded Disaster Management with Albers, and the two were once brothers-in-law. When immigration authorities raided TentLogix in 2018, it shared an address with Disaster Management.

The raid followed a 2016 Homeland Security Investigations audit of Tentlogix, which found the company had 96 undocumented employees on its books. According to court records, Hendry then attempted to deceive investigators by creating a shell company and transferring the undocumented workers to that entity to conceal them from Homeland Security Investigations auditors. But the agency discovered the scheme and found undocumented workers at the company's site when officials raided it in 2018. That year, Albers was listed as one of four officers on the company's corporate filings.

In 2019, Hendry pleaded guilty to immigration charges alongside another company officer and was sentenced to a year in prison. (He served a little over three months, then was granted an early release because of the pandemic.) TentLogix, the corporate entity, also pleaded guilty and was ordered to forfeit over $3 million. Although Albers was not personally charged, he signed off on the company's guilty plea, court records show. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2020.

Hendry did not respond to a request for comment.

Disaster Management's federal contracting work has been lucrative for Albers. Last year, he purchased a $30 million house in Jupiter, Florida, that then ranked as the area's most expensive home.

Albers also has recently become a large donor to Republican campaigns, to which he's given more than $150,000 in the last year alone. He and his wife spent election night at Mar-a-Lago in 2024 and once co-chaired a charity fundraiser at the Trump National Golf Club with the president's son, Eric, and his wife. They attended the “Crypto Ball,” a cryptocurrency event sponsored by Trump supporters in the digital currency industry; participants paid between $2,500 and $1 million for tickets. (The Trump Organization did not respond to questions from ProPublica.)

Since late last year, Disaster Management has spent $210,000 lobbying Congress and the administration on immigration-related issues, including “funding related to temporary facilities.” The company had no prior history of lobbying, according to federal disclosures.

Disaster Management's share of the immigration detention contract for Fort Bliss could rank among the company's largest contracts.

The Fort Bliss award comes as immigration arrests have soared in recent months and ICE is running low on space to hold everyone it has detained. In the past, those arrested by ICE would mostly be housed in brick-and-mortar detention facilities.

But in its urgency to increase deportations, the Trump administration has turned to contractors to build so-called soft-sided facilities — tents with rigid structures inside — that can be set up much more quickly.

The administration has eyed military bases as locations to set up these new detention camps. In April, ICE announced a $3.8 billion award to build such a facility to Deployed Resources, which had operated the lion's share of the soft-sided facilities used in the past to temporarily house immigrants entering the country along the southern border.

ICE abruptly canceled that contract just days after it was announced without explanation. Now it appears Disaster Management could do much of that work. An industry insider estimated to ProPublica that Disaster Management's slice of the $1.2 billion contract at Fort Bliss could be worth hundreds of millions for the company in the next year, though it's not clear how the three contractors will split the work. Bloomberg first reported the total value of the Fort Bliss contract.

The facility at Fort Bliss is expected to be the first of many. Earlier in the month, Trump signed a spending bill that allocates $45 billion to build new migrant detention sites. Experts estimate this could roughly double the country's capacity for immigration detention from around 50,000 people to more than 100,000.

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

At least six people have been killed, and 22 others wounded in a terrorist attack in southeastern Iran on Saturday, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has said. A mother and a one-year-old baby were among the dead, according to the local authorities.

A group of three gunmen attacked a courthouse in the Islamic Republic's Sistan and Baluchestan province on Saturday morning, killing and injuring the building's staff and clients, the IRGC said in a statement published later in the day.

The gunmen started a shootout with the police after failing to sneak into the building dressed as clients, Mehr News said, citing the local authorities. Before being killed, one reportedly threw a grenade into the building, killing and injuring a number of civilians.

The other two gunmen were killed in the ensuing firefight on the street.

According to the IRGC, the attackers were found to have been wearing suicide vests.

The province where the attack took place is located on the border with Pakistan and Afghanistan, and is home to Iran's Baloch Sunni minority. The area regularly sees deadly clashes between Iranian forces and armed groups.

The Jaish al-Adl Baloch jihadist group – headquartered in neighboring Pakistan but also operating in Iran – has taken responsibility for the deadly attack. In a statement earlier in the day, the group urged civilians to flee the area.

Last January, Tehran launched strikes on the Jaish al-Adl headquarters in southwestern Pakistan, after the jihadist group declared responsibility for a suicide bombing that killed nearly a dozen Iranian police officers the previous month.

VILNIUS, July 26. /TASS/. Vilnius will allocate 30 mln euros for the purchase of US Patriot anti-aircraft missile systems for Ukraine, Lithuanian Defense Minister Dovile Sakaliene told the BNS agency following a meeting of Baltic states' defense chiefs with their American colleague Pete Hegseth.

""Lithuania has announced its position that it will join the purchase of US-produced weapons, specifically the acquisition of Patriot systems, allocating about 30 mln euros for this purpose,"" the agency quoted the minister as saying.

""In this way, we are sending a strategic message that we fully share this decision of US President Donald Trump,"" Sakaliene noted.

Trump said earlier that Washington would continue transferring weapons and military equipment to Ukraine if Europe pays for the supplies. Coordination will be carried out by NATO.

Ukrainian drones struck the Signal radio plant in Russia's Stavropol Krai overnight on July 26, a source in Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent.

The plant, located around 500 kilometers (311 miles) from Ukraine-controlled territory, manufactures electronic warfare equipment for front-line aircraft and is a major part of Russia's military-industrial complex. 

One of the strikes targeted a building housing expensive imported equipment, including computer numerical control machines, the source said. The second strike hit a separate building that hosts an electronic devices workshop.

""The SBU continues to systematically disable enemy (Russia's) facilities working for the war against Ukraine,"" the source said. ""Each such attack stops production processes and reduces the enemy's military potential.""

The facility is sanctioned by the European Union, the U.S., Ukraine, and Japan. Russian independent media outlet Astra published video footage allegedly showing a direct drone strike on one of the facility's buildings.

Stavropol Krai Governor Vladimir Vladimirov confirmed the attack, saying drones targeted industrial facilities in the region and caused a small fire. No casualties were reported.

Russia's Defense Ministry claimed that its forces shot down 54 Ukrainian drones overnight across eight Russian regions. The ministry did not report any drones being intercepted over Stavropol Krai.

Founded in 1971, the Signal plant is one of the largest defense enterprises in the North-Caucasian Federal District. It produces active jamming systems, remote weapon-control modules, and other radio-electronic equipment. 

It operates under Rostec's KRET cluster, a central structure in Russia's defense sector.

On July 25, Ukrainian drones hit a chemical plant in the same region. Ukraine's military regularly strikes military targets deep within Russia in an attempt to diminish Moscow's fighting power as it continues its war.

GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) — Ed Policy began his tenure as the Green Bay Packers' president/CEO by paying tribute to his predecessor.

Policy officially took over for Mark Murphy on Friday as the NFL's only publicly owned franchise held its annual shareholders meeting. During Murphy's 17 seasons on the job, the Packers made 13 playoff appearances, with the 2010 team winning a Super Bowl.

“I assure you that going forward I'm going to lean heavily on your example and your pearls of wisdom as I move the organization into the future,” Policy said.

Murphy is stepping down because he reached the franchise's mandatory retirement age of 70 earlier this month. Murphy said he felt he could continue meeting the demands of this position but added that he agrees with the Packers' retirement policy.

“In my career – business and with the league and others – you see examples where maybe people stay on a little too long, so I think this serves the Packers well,” Murphy said.

Policy, 54, didn't focus much on his own plans during the shareholders meeting, which instead pretty much served as a testimonial for Murphy.

There were plenty of shouts of “Thank you, Mark,” among the 6,529 shareholders in the Lambeau Field stands. On a hot afternoon, many shareholders tried to cool themselves off by waving fans that featured Murphy's face. A tribute video included messages from NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and former commissioner Paul Tagliabue among others.




Murphy signed autographs and greeted fans after the Packers' Friday morning practice and again after the shareholders meeting.

“It's a little bittersweet,” Murphy said. “Obviously, I'm a very appreciative and I also feel honored, too, that the fans have been so supportive of me and the organization. But (I'm) really excited too for the future of the organization and for Ed in particular.”

The Packers say Murphy, who played defensive back for Washington from 1977-84, is believed to be the only person to earn a Super Bowl ring both as a player and as a team's chief executive. He was on Washington's 1982 championship team.

His stint as Green Bay's president/CEO included the construction of Titletown, a 45-acre development adjacent to Lambeau Field that features shops, restaurants and apartments.

He capped his tenure earlier this year by welcoming the NFL Draft to Green Bay, an event that drew an announced three-day total attendance of 600,000. Murphy also presided over multiple renovations to Lambeau Field, including the opening of a new home locker room this week.

“He's been tremendous for us,” wide receiver Jayden Reed said. “I thanked him today, knowing this was his last day here, so I went up to him and I thanked him for everything. Without him, we wouldn't be standing in this locker room right now. He's been a tremendous help to all of us, very supportive. He gets this thing done. I appreciate him for that.”

Murphy said he hopes to stay involved in the game and noted that he's talked to Goodell about things he'd like to do on a league level. He also mentioned spending more time with his family and increasing his involvement in his charity work and in the golf course he owns at Baileys Harbor, Wisconsin.

The Packers' board of directors unanimously selected Policy as Murphy's replacement after a search committee recommended him last year. Policy, the son of former San Francisco 49ers and Cleveland Browns president, joined the Packers as vice president and general counsel in August 2012 and was promoted to chief operating officer in January 2018.

“I want to thank you, our owners, for investing so much in me over the past 13 years,” Policy told the shareholders. “It's been really special, and I intend to pay it back with results both on and off the field.”

Packers coach Matt LaFleur, general manager Brian Gutekunst and executive vice president/director of player operations Russ Ball report to the president/CEO under the team's leadership structure. All three of them have two years remaining on their contracts.

Policy said earlier this year he has no plans to extend those contracts before this season, though he praised all three men and noted his long working relationships with them.

“(I'm) certainly going to miss Mark and everything that he's done for this place, but feel like we're in great hands with a guy like Ed Policy,” LaFleur said.

Murphy was asked what advice he had for Policy.

“The one thing I told him is he's got to be himself,” Murphy said. “I've seen him grow quite a bit as a leader. The search ended up with him. They did a great job. There's no question he's positioned and ready to have success.

“He and I have talked about it. Don't be afraid to change things. Follow your instincts. He's got really good business sense. Hopefully we put him in a position where he can have success not only in the short term but the long term of the organization.”

NOTES: LaFleur said OL Aaron Banks is “day to day” with a back issue. … Rookie WR Savion Williams didn't practice Friday due to a concussion.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Democrats' popularity falls further as nearly two-thirds hold ‘unfavorable' view of party: Poll","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/3483170/democratic-popularity-falls-further-poll/","Sat, 26 Jul 2025 20:56:51 GMT","

The fortunes of the Democratic Party continue to tank, with a new poll giving the party its lowest favorability rating in 35 years.

The poll from the Wall Street Journal found 63% of voters have an unfavorable view of the Democratic Party, compared to 33% who hold a favorable view. This is compared to the 11% deficit in unfavorability suffered by the Republican Party. Enthusiasm is also on the Republicans' side — just 8% of voters view the Democrats “very favorably,” while 19% view the Republicans “very favorably.”

The poll found another pattern — Republicans were able to reap the benefits of Trump's popularity while insulating themselves from his more unpopular stances. For example, voters disapproved of Trump's handling of tariffs by a massive 17 points, yet trusted Republicans more than Democrats on the issue by 7 points. Trump's handling of inflation has an 11-point deficit, yet voters trust Republicans more on the issue by 10 points.

The only issues Democrats enjoyed more confidence in were healthcare and vaccines.

The dismal Democratic rating reflects the uniquely bad position the party finds itself in. The party has been unable to come up with a coherent message after being routed by Trump and the Republicans in November, failing to satisfy centrists looking to moderate their image and leftists hoping to intensify their message.

The current dissatisfaction comes from three main angles — centrists believing the party has gone too far to the left, leftists who believe the party has gone too far to the center, and resistance Democrats who believe the party isn't fighting Trump hard enough.

IN UGLY DEMOCRATIC FEUD, BOTH SIDES DESERVE TO LOSE

Polls on Trump's approval rating have varied drastically over the past month, with the Wall Street Journal putting it at 46%, though substantially higher than at this point in his first term, when it was at 40%.

The poll surveyed 1,500 registered voters from July 16-20. The margin of error is plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

 Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have permanently reduced volatility and altered Bitcoin market dynamics, according to analysts. 

Bitcoin (BTC) will no longer experience “parabolic” price rallies or “devastating” bear markets, because BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have permanently reduced volatility and altered market dynamics, according to Blockware BTC analyst Mitchell Askew.

“BTC/USD looks like two entirely different assets before and after the ETF,” the analyst wrote on Friday. The chart he shared showed a sharp reduction in price volatility following the January 2024 launch of the Bitcoin ETF in the United States. The analyst said:

Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote that the reduced volatility has helped Bitcoin “attract even bigger fish and gives it a fighting chance to be adopted as currency.”  The tradeoff to this is that there will likely be no more “God Candles,” the analyst added.

The effects of the Bitcoin ETF on market dynamics continue to be debated by market analysts, as the investment vehicle further intertwines traditional finance, institutional investors, and digital asset markets.

Bitcoin ETFs sequester capital into traditional investment vehicles that currently lack in-kind redemption and keep funds off-chain.

This stowing away of capital can prevent the rotation into altcoins, which crypto investors have come to expect from previous market cycles.

In July, net inflows into Bitcoin ETFs crossed the $50 billion mark, though the surge of capital into Bitcoin has not translated to increased onchain activity.

Retail investors are shifting into Bitcoin ETFs and gaining exposure through traditional financial instruments held by a fund manager or another financial fiduciary on their behalf, rather than holding BTC directly, according to analysts.

The demand for paper BTC and products like BlockRock's Bitcoin ETF has led the asset manager to accumulate 3% of Bitcoin's total supply, raising concerns about centralization among some market participants.

Bit Digital, a Nasdaq-listed crypto firm, is deepening its commitment to Ethereum as it pivots from its previous Bitcoin-centric operations. 

In a July 25 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company proposed a significant increase in authorized share capital, from 340 million to 1 billion ordinary shares.

According to the filing, the new capital will primarily fund Ethereum acquisitions. The firm stated that its goal is to raise approximately $10 million, with a shareholder vote scheduled for September 10.

The company also clarified that proceeds from the proposed share issuance will support broader corporate initiatives, including mergers and acquisitions, employee compensation, dividend distributions, and general operations.

Bit Digital believes that its current share capital structure restricts its ability to scale, particularly in alignment with its long-term growth strategy centered around Ethereum.

This proposal reflects a dramatic transformation in the company's strategic direction. Once known for its Bitcoin mining business, Bit Digital now views Ethereum as a core treasury asset.

Earlier in July, the firm sold 280 Bitcoin from its reserves, reallocating roughly $172 million to boost its Ethereum holdings. 

Following this move, Bit Digital's Ethereum balance surged from 24,434 ETH to over 100,600 ETH. An additional purchase of 19,683 ETH on July 18 further lifted its total to approximately 120,306 ETH.

This places it among the top 10 Ethereum treasury reserve holders, behind SharpLink and BitMine. Cumulatively, these kinds of firms hold more than 2.3 million ETH, valued at nearly $9 billion.

Nonetheless, Bit Digital's aggressive accumulation strategy demonstrates the company's growing conviction in Ethereum's future.

“ETH can offer a rare combination of capital appreciation and native yield, making it an institutional titan. Its value is reinforced by strong onchain utility and a global community of developers. No other asset, including BTC, matches the depth of its ecosystem and built-in earning potential,” Bit Digital stated.

Beyond Ethereum accumulation, the company actively stakes its holdings and operates Ethereum validators, transforming its treasury into a yield-generating asset base.

BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has declared that the OG NFT collection CryptoPunks will outperform Ethereum (ETH) in this cycle, citing internet status culture as the primary driver.

With NFT market volumes exploding and Ethereum showing bullish momentum, his forecast has ignited debate among analysts and collectors alike.

Hayes believes that as ETH gains institutional traction, holders will increasingly flex their wealth through digital art and status NFTs like CryptoPunks.

“Cryptopunks will outperform $ETH this cycle in $ terms bc $ETH bag holders will flex in NFTs,” he tweeted. “It's an internet status game.”

According to the Maelstrom Fund CIO, the entire global economy is built on status, and the “internet society” is no different. His argument has resonated across the NFT community, with investor Parzival highlighting the scarcity factor:

“8,000,000,000 people on earth, 10,000 CryptoPunks. Do the math.”

Others, like digital art collector Balon, highlighted the skyrocketing floor 12 hours earlier:

“CryptoPunks floor is already at 100 ETH? Things are about to get crazy.”

This frenzy isn't theoretical either; NFT enthusiast Jediwolf reported on July 21 a “spectacular” sweep of 76 Punks for approximately $13.5 million within 5 hours, the largest since 2021.

On that same date, CoinGecko brought attention to a massive $1 billion single-day surge in NFT market cap, jumping from $5.1 billion to $6.3 billion. Daily volumes spiked 287% to $37.4 million, fueling renewed speculation that non-fungible tokens could be entering a fresh phase of explosive growth.

Animoca's Yat Siu noted the correlation in a recent post on X, stating that the last time ETH peaked in late 2021 was also NFT season. CryptoPunks leads the charge, and their floor price is now at 48 ETH, which is about $175,726, according to live NFTpricefloor data.

Hayes' prediction comes amid a roaring ETH rally powered by growing institutional demand. Since May 15, spot Ethereum ETFs and corporate treasuries have bought 2.83 million ETH for more than $10 billion. This is over 32 times the net new supply, and Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan has projected demand to hit $20 billion in the next year.

At the time of this writing, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency was consolidating around $3,672, down 1% in the last 24 hours but up more than 63% across 30 days. Earlier in the week, the asset broke past $3,800, and the NFT ecosystem, built mainly on Ethereum, appears to be riding shotgun on its bullish wave.

BNB rose around 0.6% in the last 24 hours, shaking off a recent drop to now trade close to $780. At its peak, the token reached $785.75, bouncing from a low of $761.22 during a stretch of high-volume trading.

Much of the volume centered on a sharp correction, when BNB dropped from $774.52 to $761.34 on volume more than twice the daily average, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model.

That pullback, however, was short-lived. 

BNB's price traced a V-shaped recovery, ending near its high and well above the key $761 support zone. The rebound came after Windtree Therapeutics committed $520 million toward its planned BNB corporate treasury.

The purchase represents one of the largest non-crypto institutional entries into a non-bitcoin token to date. Other companies, including Nano Labs, have also been betting on BNB, whose supply has been steadily dropping over Binance's and BNB Chain's token burns.

Meanwhile, BNB Chain continues to grow its developer ecosystem. The platform announced the next cohort of its Most Valuable Builder accelerator, backing 15 early-stage startups working in AI, decentralized finance, and tokenized real-world assets.

BNB is now showing signs of consolidation as it hovers around the $780 level, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model.

 Tyler Winklevoss claims JPMorgan paused Gemini's onboarding after he criticized the bank's data access fees, calling the move anti-competitive. 

Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss has accused JPMorgan Chase of halting the crypto exchange's onboarding process in response to his public criticism of the bank's new data access policy.

In a Friday post on X, Winklevoss claimed JPMorgan retaliated after he called out the banking giant's new move as anti-competitive behavior that could harm fintech and crypto firms.

“My tweet from last week struck a nerve. This week, JPMorgan told us that because of it they were pausing their re-onboarding of Gemini as a customer after they off-boarded us during Operation ChokePoint 2.0,” the Gemini boss wrote.

The dispute stems from a recent Bloomberg report that revealed JPMorgan's decision to charge financial technology firms for access to customer bank data — a move Winklevoss argued would “bankrupt fintechs” that facilitate crypto purchases.

Winklevoss accused JPMorgan of attempting to restrict consumers' free access to their banking data through third-party fintech platforms like Plaid. Plaid is a third-party service that helps link financial accounts to a variety of apps and online services. 

“Sorry Jamie Dimon, we're not going to stay silent. We will continue to call out this anti-competitive, rent-seeking behavior and immoral attempt to bankrupt fintech and crypto companies. We will never stop fighting for what is right!”

Gemini's relationship with JPMorgan has been rocky for years. In 2023, under the Biden administration, the bank reportedly asked the exchange to find another banking partner, citing profitability concerns.

However, Gemini denied the rumors. At the time, the exchange said that “despite reporting to the contrary, Gemini's banking relationship remains intact with JPMorgan.”

Cointelegraph reached out to both Gemini and JPMorgan for comment but had not received a response by publication.

Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss have aligned themselves politically with Trump, contributing to his past campaign and attending several White House events. The duo even had their donations to Trump's election campaign in 2024 returned after their Bitcoin donations exceeded the maximum amount allowed under federal law.

Last month, Gemini also filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The number of shares to be offered and the price range per share have not been determined.

Gemini was founded in 2014 by twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. In November 2021, it announced a fundraise of $400 million at a valuation of $7.1 billion.

Some of the tests you list (like A1C) are baseline things everyone should get checked every year. Agreed that the others could provide value for those who want to know more about their risk level; however, it's uncommon for those tests to turn up positives without one of the baselines having already raised at least a yellow flag.None of the tests you listed will tell you whether you have any soft plaque buildup. They just tell you more about your risk factors. However, there are ultrasound tests that can detect increased blood pressure in major arteries, which IIRC does reflect soft plaque buildup.

These tests don't have perfect accuracy and resolution, so low or zero results don't mean that a lifetime of high cholesterol won't catch up with someone in their 60s and 70s, yet a lot of podcasters and social media influencers are making those claims.

A ketogenic diet is 70% fat.It's literally impossible to get into keto with a diet of leafy greens and salmon. You would have to augment with a lot of fat from some other source and also limit salmon intake to avoid consuming too much protein. Salmon has too much protein and not enough fat to even come close to keto ratios.You must be thinking of a different diet. A lot of people think keto is another word for low carb, but a real keto diet is very low carb and low protein.

The other problem is that they're picking and choosing which tests to believe and which to ignore.They disregard their cholesterol tests because they don't like the results, but embrace one or two CAC tests because they do like the results (when they're young).However the CAC results are a lagging indicator of cumulative damage that has been done. Cholesterol tests are correlated with the rate of damage occurring.So embracing CAC and using it to justify ignoring LDL and others is the problem.

The downside, of course, is that once the damage is done, it's done, so it's a risk. (And as you said, they won't see the damage in their 20s.)

If you're old: Great! Keep an eye on cholesterol.CAC is a lagging indicator. Its usefulness is more about assessing damage done, not rate of change or future risk.

My experience is, your total cholesterol is over 200 (with some more specifics about LDL I can't recall, like 130 or something), all doctors everywhere will then hound you incessantly to get on Crestor, immediately.   Diet and exercise don't matter (they cite research showing it doesn't make a difference).  Whether you have plaque or not isn't considered, you need to be on Crestor right now to prevent it from starting anyway.My cholesterol started really going up in my late 40s and I can concur an aggressive change to my diet where I significantly reduced my saturated fat intake and I lost about 20 pounds made absolutely no difference, and my total cholesterol started hitting 300, so I'm on the Crestor.  My initial dose did cause me to have elevated liver enzymes and my total cholesterol went to about 170 in about a month, so I'm on an extremely low dose on alternating days.

Predator: Killer of Killers ended with a tease of where the franchise could go next, and as it turns out, that's not the full ending.

After Torres and Kenji escape from the Grendel King, we see Yautja cart a cryogenically frozen Ursa away into a collection of prisoners. One of them is is Naru, the protagonist of 2022's Prey played by Amber Midthunder. During the Predator: Badlands panel for San Diego Comic-Con, the Killers ending was shown, further revealing that Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover), the leads of the first two films, were also captured. And that extra snippet will be added to Killer of Killers later tonight.

It's not over yet. Stream a new extended ending of Predator: Killer of Killers tonight at 7pm PT on Hulu. pic.twitter.com/sPQrr66HCS

— Predator (@Predator) July 25, 2025



Ahead of Killers' release, Trachtenberg confirmed to io9 that “people who defeat the Predator get captured and are frozen,” which helps laid the groundwork for the Dutch and Harrigan reveals. He also said at the time he planned to get back to Naru when he had the chance. Now that we know those three are in the picture, those plans could start to take some more shape as he steers the franchise towards wherever it's going.

Until we learn more about those plans, you can watch Predator: Killer of Killers on Hulu, and Predator: Badlands when it hits theaters November 7.

Oscar O'Neill dives into the controversy surrounding this year's expanded Club World Cup

by Oscar O'Neill

  	Saturday July 26 2025, 6:09pm  	



On the surface, the concept of a Club World Cup sounds fantastic. The best teams from around the globe playing each other, to win the prestigious title of being labelled the world's best club side.

Why, then, is the tournament attracting so little attention and enthusiasm from across the footballing world? Jamie Carragher has said that there is not “any appetite” for the tournament from “players, clubs and even supporters,” with Juergen Klopp adding that the tournament is “the worst idea ever invented”. A cynic could call Klopp's distaste a product of Liverpool's omission from the tournament despite cantering to last season's Premier League, yet a dislike of the tournament is shared by a diverse group of fans, players and commentators alike.

“There is clearly a general lack of interest from spectators – and who can blame them?”

More general concerns have been raised relating to issues surrounding player welfare, with injury risk increasing as well as the danger of burnout. The French Players' Union even described FIFA's decision to hold an expanded tournament as a “game of massacre”. Perhaps this is somewhat of an exaggeration, as there have not been an unusual amount of injuries during the tournament. International tournaments following the end of the traditional club season are very common, with no notably major adverse effects on players.

The main issue with the Club World Cup is undoubtedly the absence of fan interest, and there are a number of reasons behind this. Firstly, there is the issue of location – the US is hardly the epicentre of global football. The problem of a lack of domestic interest in the tournament is then further added to by a number of other issues, such as awkward fixture times for European and African viewers, as well as issues surrounding affordability, with the US being an expensive country to travel to and stay in.

“A reasonable level of success – if success is measured in sponsor interest, global exposure, and a staggering $1 billion of TV rights”

Ticket prices are also important to consider here: the cheapest available for the opening game (upon initial release) cost a rather steep £257. Takeup was initially very low, forcing drastic cuts in prices to attract more fans. Prices were cut to under £100, with some tickets available for as little as £25. Despite these mammoth price cuts, there has hardly been a scramble for tickets. During the group stage, the average percentage of stadium capacity used was a measly 56%, with that figure jumping slightly to 62% for the round of 16 stage. Clearly there is a general lack of interest from spectators in the tournament – and who can blame them?

The 2024-2025 season began some eleven months ago, and all the consequential domestic and European competitions finished up two months ago. So, as Mr Carragher rightly said, there is little appetite to go and watch what is essentially a few glamorous friendlies with an inconsequential trophy that has no history or gravitas as the prize. This seems to be a tournament that no one wanted. But, obviously, it must be wanted by someone, or else it wouldn't be happening.

The Quiet Death of the FA Cup

The culprit as usual is FIFA, and perhaps more specifically their charming and typically incorruptible Swiss-Italian President Gianni Infantino. And, as with the Qatar World Cup of 2022, Infantino appears to be trying to charm the world into actually enjoying his bizarre brainchild, in a way akin to Mark Zuckerberg trying to win the world over to his equally strange Virtual Reality Metaverse. Nevertheless, Infantino will be pleased with the tournament this year, despite its teething problems and lack of fan interest. Most importantly, of course, there has been a reasonable level of success – if success is measured in sponsor interest, global exposure, and a staggering $1 billion of TV rights. As a result, despite fan ambivalence, it looks like this unwanted world cup is here to stay.

We head to the Middle East for the latest enthralling UFC action

The UFC bandwagon rolls back into the United Arab Emirates this weekend for the first time since UFC 308: Topuria vs Holloway last October. Robert Whittaker was in the co-main event on that occasion, but this time the Aussie takes centre stage at the Etihad Arena, when he clashes with Reinier de Ridder in an intriguing middleweight bout.

Whittaker, who was crowned UFC middleweight champion back in 2017, will have painful memories of the last time he stepped into the Octagon in Abu Dhabi. He was forced to tap out in the opening round of his UFC 308 match-up with the unbeaten and classy Khamzat Chimaev. ‘The Reaper' had been holding a 100% record in the Arabian country prior to that loss, following back-to-back successes against Darren Till & Jared Cannonier in 2020. Whittaker will be hoping to rediscover some of that winning form this Saturday night (July 26), when he takes on a surging Reinier de Ridder.

Robert Whittaker's opponent was also in action in Abu Dhabi last year. However, the Dutchman will have a happier time recalling his time spent in the Middle East. He pulled off a devastating first round stoppage victory against Magomedmurad Khasaev at ‘UAE Warriors 51' in the summer of 2024. That triumph was the start of a 4-fight win streak for De Ridder, as he rattled off further stoppage successes since joining the UFC, against Gerald Meerschaert, Kevin Holland and Bo Nickal between November last year and May.

Elsewhere on the card, the previously scheduled Movsar Evloev vs Aaron Pico bout is now cancelled, due to Evloev picking up an injury. The new co-main event features the former UFC bantamweight champion, Petr Yan, who goes head-to-head with Marcus McGhee. Yan is still rebuilding after losing three on the bounce in 2022 & 2023. Wins last year against Song Yadong and Deiveson Figueiredo helped steady the ship though. McGhee heads to Abu Dhabi in confident mood following six straight successes and he'll be hoping to give a positive performance in his first ever fight outside the United States.

Bianca Andreescu returns to Canada and is welcomed by a tough draw which includes an opening round contest against Barbora Krejcikova. 

The Canadian will face the former Wimbledon champion in a blockbuster opening round match which both players will feel they need to win. 

Andreescu is ranked 188 in the world and is once again aiming to overcome an injury-stricken season in order to produce some magic in North America. 

Should Andreescu win her opening round match then fourth seed Mirra Andreeva will await in the second round. 

Andreeva could face another Canadian in the form of Leylah Fernandez in the third round before a fourth round match against Daria Kasatkina. 

The potential quarter-final for Andreeva could be either Elena Rybakina or Emma Navarro, who could face Rebecca Marino in the first round. 

Top seed Coco Gauff could face Danielle Collins to begin her campaign with potentially Sofia Kenin awaiting in the last 16. 

However, Kenin could face Canadian rising star Victoria Mboko in her opening round contest. 

The bottom half of the draw will see Jessica Pegula take on either Maria Sakkari or Carson Branstine in the opening round. 

Pegula won Toronto last year and will be hoping to match her form from last year's North American hard court swing. 

The American could face compatriot Amanda Anisimova in the quarter-finals as Anisimova aims to overcome her Wimbledon final humiliation with a win against either Lulu Sun or Sorana Cirstea. 

In-form Emma Raducanu could await Anisimova in the third round as the Brit will open up her campaign against Elena-Gabriela Ruse with Peyton Stearns awaiting in the second round. 

Other storylines are Madison Keys' potential second round contest with Tatjana Maria while Genie Bouchard plays the final tournament of her career and will begin against Emiliana Arango with Belinda Bencic awaiting in the second round. 

Finally, Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek will begin her campaign against Yulia Putintseva or a qualifier with Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Clara Tauson also in her section of the draw.

Townsend will replace her usual partner, Katerina Siniakova, at No. 1—Siniakova is spending her 161st career week there this week, and 46th straight since the end of the US Open last year.A player's WTA doubles ranking is based off of their best 12 results over the last 12 months, and nine of both Townsend and Siniakova's best 12 results have come with each other—two titles (the Australian Open and Dubai this year), one more final (the WTA Finals last year), four more semifinals (the US Open last year and Indian Wells, Miami and Wimbledon this year) and two more quarterfinals (Cincinnati last year and Roland Garros this year).But when it comes down to their other three best results, Townsend now surpasses Siniakova—the Czech's total 835 ranking points, while Townsend's will now total either 945 or 1,120 ranking points, depending on how the final goes in D.C.

Tiafoe failed to serve out the first set at 6-5 before Shelton roared back. Continuing his success in tiebreakers, the lefty won six straight points to take a one set lead, and broke Tiafoe again at 3-3 on the way to a straight-sets win.""We know tennis is a long journey. We're going to play each other a bunch of times,"" Shelton said post-match, adding that ""it's tough not to cheer for a guy like that"" after the two hugged it out at the net.Shelton finished the match with 29 winners to Tiafoe's 20.

""This court does a lot for my serve,"" Shelton later added. ""The ability to get the ball out of the zone is huge, especially against a guy like Foe who is so good in the pocket. So my ability for my flat serves not only to be coming in at 145 [mph] but also rising above his shoulders is huge.""Second serve, too. He's one of the best in the world when he's locked in, attacking second serves and making you feel like you're on the back foot, taking a second serve and coming to the net.

Leylah Fernandez emerged victorious in a gripping battle with Elena Rybakina Saturday to reach the Mubadala Citi DC Open final in Washington, D.C.And she did so after Rybakina served for the match in the second set, leading to a dramatic encounter lasting three hours and 16 minutes.On a day that produced little to separate the competitors, it was Fernandez who out-served the 2022 Wimbledon champion when it counted to secure the 6-7 (2), 7-6 (3), 7-6 (3) victory.""'Hard work' and 'fight' has been the pillars, my tennis journey, my dad and I and our family on everyday life,"" Fernandez told press.

""'Hard work' and 'fight' has been the pillars, my tennis journey, my dad and I and our family on everyday life,"" Fernandez told press.

The left-hander won 16 of her first 17 points on serve, but watched as Rybakina rocketed consecutive return winners in the opening tiebreak to swing the momentum in her favor. The Kazakh appeared to be in control by securing an immediate break to launch set two, but an inability to extend her lead to a double break despite chances in her next two return games—including 0-40 at 3-1—would later cost the No. 3 seed.Sensing Rybakina's tightness, Fernandez worked the energy of the crowd to her advantage to level for 5-5. Back in another now-or-never situation, the Canadian opened a 5-0 lead en route to trading tiebreaks on the scoreboard.

Neither player managed to create a break point in the decider, leading to one final shootout. Fernandez saved two of her best forehand strikes of the encounter to open a 4-0 advantage. While Rybakina regained one of the mini breaks, Fernandez would not be denied to complete the comeback effort when her opponent's forehand flew long.The 22-year-old is through to her first final of the season and is 3-3 in her previous trips.

ONBOARD: Lando Norris' 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the Belgian Grand Prix 

'I drove a tiny bit better' - Polesitter Norris on the small margins that made the difference in Spa Qualifying

Team Principals Ayao Komatsu, Jonathan Wheatley and Laurent Mekies face the press ahead of the Belgian Grand Prix weekend.

TEAM REPRESENTATIVES: Laurent MEKIES (Red Bull Racing), Jonathan WHEATLEY (Kick Sauber), Ayao KOMATSU (Haas)

Q: Laurent, if we could start with you, please. Many congratulations on the new job, first of all. You've been in it about two weeks. Can you start by giving us your first impressions of Red Bull Racing?

Laurent MEKIES: You know, the first impression is that you get into the building – a building Jonathan knows very well – you get through the trophy room and how can you feel? You just feel honoured, privileged. It's unbelievable achievements that the team have been getting the last 20 years. So that's the first wow effect you get. And then, of course, what these two weeks have been about is really trying to meet as many people as possible from the team. There is no other way, I think, to try to get to know the team, to start to understand the strengths and the weaknesses, to understand how we will be able to eventually support. That's what I've been doing the last two weeks, trying to meet as many of our people as possible. And the good news is it's an incredible team. They didn't win by luck or by mistakes. They won because of the accumulation of talents that there is in the buildings. Every small box you open and you look at how they go about a given topic or another thing, every time you say, “Wow, that's really nice.” And that's all coming from the people there at all levels that have been doing amazing jobs for all these years. Maybe that man [Wheatley] as well. So really, that's how the first two weeks have been.

Q: And have you seen enough to be able to tell us what you think the biggest differences are between Red Bull Racing and Racing Bulls where you were before?

LM: The short answer is no. I think it would be wrong to compare teams at this stage. But it's fair to say that the game is changing when you try and fight for wins, when you're trying to fight for championships, and how extreme you have to go in every single area to grab the last bit of performance. That means you need to make some very bold choices, very bold decisions. This is what you find in all these small boxes we were talking about before – how extreme the team goes about every single detail in order to eventually get that ultimate performance that you need for the sort of ambition the team has.

Q: Jonathan, if I could come to you now, you joined Sauber mid-season. How difficult is it to pick up the baton during a busy racing season?

Jonathan WHEATLEY: I think it's a challenge, but everything about being a team principal of a Formula 1 team is a challenge. You can't always choose when you start the position, and you have to make the most of it. It's been a very intense period of time, my first four months or something with the team. I have to say I've loved every second: the new challenges, the energy, the atmosphere in the team. And of course, that's just getting stronger, and the energy is just getting more intense as a result of our performances recently.

Q: Just on the topic of Red Bull Racing, it's a team where you spent many years. Can you just give us your thoughts on the news that Christian Horner has been relieved of his operational duties?

JW: I'd like to start by saying look at what Christian achieved in that team. Look what the team that he was part of achieved over the last twenty years. I had a fantastic time in Milton Keynes. I have a slightly more scenic drive to work now, but I know the strength and depth of the people there, and I know the task that Laurent's taken on is going to be exciting for him. I want to say on a personal level that I wish Christian absolutely the very best in the future, but also that two really good friends of mine, this gentleman sat to my right here Laurent and also Alan Permane, it's provided opportunities in their careers and their career development. Honestly, out of everything comes something hugely positive, and I'm really, really pleased for Laurent and Alan.

Q: Jonathan, your team has scored more points in the last four races than Red Bull Racing. In terms of performance, do you feel you're building some momentum now in Hinwil?

JW: Yeah. I mean, look, let's face it. I doubt we're going to be regular competitors for podiums. But what I think it showed is that the small gains we're making behind the scenes, the things people can't see necessarily, on top of the performance we're putting on the car towards the end of a set of technical regulations where normally things are stale, all show good signs for the future. Like I said earlier, there's a great energy in the team. We're moving forwards. I'm not entirely sure we could have delivered that result earlier on in the season because you have to get everything right to get a podium, as these gentlemen know. But we got a great time to enjoy it and actually got to breathe and enjoy it at the factory before coming to the next race.

Q: Ayao, thank you for waiting. Let's come to you now. Am I talking to a team principal or a racing driver? Just how much did you enjoy driving the Haas at Goodwood last week?

Ayao KOMATSU: I think everyone knows I'm not a racing driver! Far from it. I'm very grateful. Amazing opportunity. I used to go to Goodwood all the time, seeing those cars going up the hill, and I never thought I'd drive a car one day [there], let alone a Formula 1 car. When we asked Gene to drive and he said yes, we decided to do the preparation together, but I still wasn't going to drive it. Then he very generously let me do it with him. I'm very grateful about that. The best thing is we celebrated our ten years really in style, and Gene absolutely loved it. I've never seen him smile so much, shaking hands with everyone, interacting with fans. That was a great experience all around.

Q: You said after Silverstone that the team had underperformed in the race. What were the issues there?

AK: Issues, honestly, starting from myself really, the whole team including myself. I think we had a wrong mindset. I think Jonathan's team and Nico showed us how to do it. We knew we had a fast car. We knew we had fast drivers. What we should have done was just focus on our race, look at what's in front of us, and do the best. Don't worry about the results because the result will come.

I think Nico and Sauber made all the right decisions, judged the conditions very, very well, and then executed it. Such great teamwork. So honestly, congratulations for you guys and also very happy for Nico as well. It's a shame that Nico couldn't do it with us when he was with us, but again, it just shows it's so important to work as a team with the correct mindset, correct objectives. Just our approach was wrong. The good thing is we've got the machinery to do it. We've got the drivers to do it. We just need to put it right.

Q: I hope we might get mixed conditions this weekend here at Spa. Are you entering the race weekend with a different mindset?

AK: 100%. Yes.

QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR

Q: (Ian Parkes – RacingNews365.com) Question for you, Laurent. Can you just give us an idea as to how things played out in the days following the British Grand Prix as much as you're allowed to, of course, with regard to the approach that was made to you to take over and, of course, your reaction to the news that the owners had decided to relieve Christian of his operational duties?

LM: Thank you. Well, it was not very different for me than it was for you, really, guys. I got a call a few hours before you guys were made aware. I got a call from Oliver [Mintzlaff] and Helmut [Marko], and they asked me if I would be interested to do the job. Obviously, it came out of the blue at that moment for me. I was actually in the UK at Racing Bulls and it came in a completely unexpected way. I actually asked them to think about it for a few hours and hung up the phone. It's difficult to digest. But the first thing that comes into your mind is, “Wait a second. It's Red Bull. They are calling you. They ask you to step in to do that job , with everything that Red Bull means – its energy, its spirit, how they go about their racing teams” and that's how you pick up the phone and you say, “Of course, it's an honour. It's a privilege.” First thought obviously goes in this moment as well to Christian because it's not something I could have expected. And he had been nothing else than extremely supportive with me these last two years. It's not a secret that he's the one with Oliver and Helmut that brought me back to the Red Bull family a couple of years ago. So that's the sort of mix of emotions you get at that moment. But as I said, the dominant one is: it's Red Bull calling. I guess it's a matter of loyalty to go towards the brand and you just say, “Of course, if you think you need me there, I will go there.”

Q: (Luke Smith – The Athletic) Laurent, another one for you. Max Verstappen's future has obviously been a big talking point in Formula 1 over the past few months. For you, how much of a priority is ensuring that Max will be remaining with the team for next year and the foreseeable future? And what conversations have you had with Max about his future?

LM: In terms of priority, I'm sure what Max wants is a fast car. If we get him a fast car, it cancels out all the other considerations. So really, the focus is very much, as we said earlier, to get to know the team as quickly as possible in order to see how we can support, how we can build the next step of competitiveness in order to get a fast car and hence make it an easy call for Max.

Q: (Andrew Benson – BBC Sport) Laurent, it's for you again, I'm afraid. What qualities do you think Oliver and Helmut saw in you that made them want to make you team principal? And what initial impressions have you formed about where Red Bull have gone a little bit off the rails so far this year and last?

LM: The first question you will have to ask them. I'm not going to take that one. The second question: all I've been seeing in these two weeks is extraordinary talent, incredible racing spirit. These guys go on the edge on every single aspect. There is not a single department where you see a bit of a feeling of laying back or resting. They really are at war, in the good sense of the word, in every single aspect. That's what you see, Andrew. So, in front of that, what we are going to try to do is make sure that all these women and men have everything they need to express themselves at their best, that they are supported, that they have all the means they need to show their talent.

They have been showing season after season that they are the best in the world or, if they are not, they are very close. To your point, you do not see weaknesses. You see a lot of desire from everyone to get that Red Bull energy, perhaps to reduce the noise outside, just to concentrate on racing. That's what you see, and that's what we are going to try to do together.

Q: (Scott Mitchell-Malm – The Race) When you had your conversations with the shareholders about the decision, what was explained to you in terms of the timing of doing it now? And what kind of plan's been outlined to you in terms of how you will run the team and how things will work? Because Helmut mentioned in an interview this week that the idea will be reduced responsibilities versus Christian and a tighter focus on the race team, for example.

LM: It's probably, because of everything we've said earlier about trying to get to know the team, trying to understand the dynamics, trying to understand the strengths and the weaknesses, a bit early to talk about structure. But for sure, one thing that is very high in our priorities is to make sure that we have the right focus, that we avoid any bottlenecking in the company at all levels. It's with that spirit that we look at what we need to do next. For sure, Formula 1 comes first. We have the chassis operation, the power unit operation. That's what is going to be the main focus. It's a racing team. People in the team love racing. That's what they are here for. That's going to be where the main focus is.

Q: (Giles Richards – The Guardian) Again for you, Laurent. This has been quite a seismic shift for many people in the team, many of whom have been there as long, if not slightly longer, than Christian. You've had two weeks now. Can you just tell us what is the state of morale within the team as they deal with this big change?

LM: For sure, the first 24 hours were a big adjustment because nobody was expecting it. The first few hours after the announcement were a surprise for everyone and certainly a digesting phase for everyone. What can I say after that? I've only been finding a huge amount of support from everyone. They just want to go racing. They are hugely respectful, and we all are, of the achievements that have been made under Christian's leadership. Could I be hoping for more support, openness from the people I've been meeting these last two weeks? No. Everybody has been incredibly supportive, willing to open the door, willing to speak, to listen, to explain their limitations and strengths, how we go next about going back to the racetrack and fighting at an even higher level tomorrow. That's what I've found.

Q: (Ronald Vording – Motorsport.com) Another one for you, Laurent. Last time Christian was in the FIA press conference, he said Red Bull has had two really successful eras in F1, and now it's all about building a third one. Do you think that's the current state of the team, that it's somehow a transitional phase and that maybe building that third era is a long-term project, also given that some of the tools, including the wind tunnel, will be online a bit later on?

LM: We normally don't like very much the word ‘transition' in Formula 1. You're right, Red Bull F1 has had these two incredible eras of success. I think the next one is dictated by the change of regulations for next year and the amazing decision to go with our own power unit with Ford. That's what will dictate a new era whether we want it or not. I think all the teams will be starting a new era because of the scale of the regulation change next year.

Q: (Phil Duncan – PA) Laurent, another one for you. I just wondered if you'd spoken to Christian since you've taken on the job. And also, Christian was obviously a big character in the sport over the last twenty years. Do you feel under pressure in any way to fill his shoes both on and off the track?

LM: At first, yes, we have spoken. He has been nothing else than supportive even in the extremely difficult context for him. He was the first one to text, he was the first one to call. I think, again this morning or yesterday we texted again. He has been nothing else than supportive, which is very impressive in the context. Nobody is going to replace his character. Nobody is going to replace him like for like. I come in to do the CEO and team principal job. Is there any way one can do it in the same way as Christian? No. Or at least, certainly not me. But we'll be relying on the incredible strengths that there are in this team. Everybody is stepping up. It's certainly an opportunity to look for even more empowerment of our people. Every time we have discussions with Jonathan, we talk about how much strength in depth you have in this team, and that's what you find. We will certainly look at this phase as a way to get our incredible people to step up and create together the next competitive advantage for the next regulation phase.

Q: (Ivo Pakvis - Panorama) Question to Laurent and Jonathan as well. Red Bull has always been known for a very distinctive team culture. Do you think that will change with new people at the top?

JW: Laurent is an incredibly impressive person. He's been a friend of mine for a really long time, and he has a wonderful way of managing people. I think the team principal's role is very much to motivate the team, to put the right people in the right positions and give them the best opportunities and the tools they need to do the job. I have no doubt whatsoever that Laurent is going to excel in that regard. I just want to say again, I want to wish him all the very best in the future, and I couldn't be happier for him.

LM: You're a bit too kind. What we want to get there is…. You're asking about the culture, everybody loves the Red Bull approach, everybody loves the Red Bull energy. I'm sure you all recall the early days when Red Bull started in Formula 1, and I'm sure Jonathan remembers them very well. We all want to feel that energy. We all want to go racing. That's what we all love, and that's the basis of our culture. Yes, it is a Red Bull culture. It's a Red Bull energy: work hard, play hard, and try to only think about racing.

Q: (Leonid Kliuev – Grande Premio Brazil) One more question for Laurent. Any details you can share about your current agreement with Red Bull? Is it just for this year? Is it multi‑year? And are there any clear goals for you to achieve, a particular place in the championship, to retain Max maybe?

LM: Thank you. Not sure how much I can share. Seriously, I don't think anyone doubts what Red Bull F1 is here to do in terms of objectives. I don't think anyone doubts what the objectives of the team are short term, mid‑term, long term: it's to fight for wins and to fight for championships. That's what it is. In terms of mission statements, that's of course the objective for the time being, For the short term and the mid‑term, is it different to what it was yesterday? No. Does anyone have a contract that guarantees him to stay forever? No. I don't either. But I think it's pretty normal in Formula 1.

Q: (Louis Dekker – NOS) For the other two: 20 years is a long time. Have you ever had the ambition to stay on for twenty years? And Laurent, for you, what will you be doing in 2045 when Max is 47 and you have a lot of grey hairs and be an old man?

AK: Twenty years? I don't know. I didn't think about it like that, to be honest. I wanted to do Formula 1 since I was 14, then came to England when I was 18 and started working in 2003. Every year has been a new challenge. There's never a moment of boredom at all. You continue to make progress as an individual, as a team, looking for the next stages. So, I don't count the years. It just happened that I've been here for more than 20 years. But it's as fresh as anything. It's very exciting – new challenges we get every single time we do our job. I'm looking forward to another new challenge continuously.

JW: I guess when I came into the sport, I thought I'd do it for a couple of years. That was 34 years ago. Twenty years ago…  Crikey. I never thought I'd meet somebody like Dietrich Mateschitz. What can happen in twenty years is extraordinary. The team he built, to be part of that journey, was incredible. Flavio Briatore…. The people that you meet, the opportunities that Formula 1 gives you… the excitement I still get about coming to Spa‑Francorchamps after all these years. There's something in all of us, we share this positive energy and love for the sport. It's well known I started as a mechanic in 1991. I'm sat here as a team principal now. The opportunity that Formula 1 gives to people – I say to so many young people when I first meet them when they're coming into the business or trying to find out about it – I'm fully energised. I don't know if I've got another 20  years at the cutting‑edge level, but it's a remarkable sport. We're all honoured and proud to be part of it, and I'm looking forward to whatever the next part of the journey is.

LM: It's exactly as Jonathan and Ayao said. The truth is we are Formula 1 fans. That's who we are. We have been from very early days, from childhood, and somehow without understanding exactly why and how you end up being paid to actually witness your hobby. To this date, for every single race, there will be a moment in the weekend where you get into the garage, where you plug in on the pit wall and you have that feeling: “I have the best seat to watch the race weekend.” That's how we feel. I hope that's also how a lot of you feel. That's the passion we have in the sport. So, as a result, we don't count the years – our hair is counting for us – but that's really how you feel. We are extremely lucky, and that's why it's important to keep that perspective and keep the right energy and the right spirit when we come racing. As much as we are competitors and live and die for the competition, we are also hardcore fans – and very privileged hardcore fans.

Q: (Michaël Duforest – Auto Hebdo) A question for all three of you and continuing on that topic. You have all started your journeys in this current position in the last eighteen months, and there have been a lot of changes in the team principal group of Formula 1. What do you think about this new generation that you guys are part of now? Ayao, should we start with you?

AK: Yeah. I think every situation is different. People have very different backgrounds. Jonathan was a mechanic; I came from an engineering background; some people come from more commercial or business backgrounds. Every team is built differently. I think the important thing is, like Laurent's been saying, you really have to spend time listening to people, understanding what we need to perform in each team. I'm sure each one of us thinks about understanding the organisation, the people, trying to get the best out of them. I don't know if it's just a generation difference, but certainly when I talk to people like Laurent, Jonathan and other team principals, the way we try to approach it, regardless of background, is actually very similar. It's a huge team sport. Nobody can do it on their own. It's not a dictatorship. You really have to motivate people, listen to people, facilitate, provide an environment where these talented, hardworking people can perform. I don't know if it's a generational thing, but that's how I see it.

JW: I would just build on what Ayao said because he's hit the nail on the head. I think there's a common theme that runs through all the team principals, which is passion for people and passion for the sport. Without the people, there's just a lot of machines in empty rooms, in big vast factories – maybe not big vast factories in our respect at the moment. It's about empowering those people, and you feel it. There's a common thread that runs through all of us.

LM: Very, very similar really. We call it the ‘hidden lap time'. It's not a lap time that will appear on your wind tunnel tracker or engine power tracker, but it's how much your people are engaged, how much they are motivated, how much they trust each other, how much they help each other. I think we all agree that's where the business is right now. That's where you can and have to make a difference. It's good news for everyone. It means it's more than ever a people's business, also because the size of the teams has grown so much that the difference between having everyone at 100% or not sometimes outweighs one innovation or another.

Q: (Tom Cary – The Telegraph) Laurent, last one for you. You mentioned in your conversations with Oliver Mintzlaff and Helmut Marko that when they offered you the job you were surprised. Did they offer you any reasons why Christian Horner had been dismissed at that point? Are you clear on why and why now?

LM: The short answer is no, they haven't. We didn't get into the why and the why now, but they outlined the sort of objectives they had for the team moving forward.

Dan Trachtenberg finally gets the Comic-Con he dreamt of when he was a young fan. 


							By

	Disney was in full on show, don't tell mode for Predator: Badlands, unveiling the intense first 15 minutes of the upcoming sci-fi adventure movie for a primed Comic-Con crowd.


	The panel showed a cameo by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny Glover that is being inserted into the animated Predator movie beginning today, and it wrapped up the panel by giving away Predator masks for every person, all 6,500 of them, in the cavernous Hall H.

	The latest Predator installment is coming in with heat thanks to a reinvigorated franchise due to the electric current whipped up by filmmaker Dan Trachtenberg. The movie is coming on the heels of Predator: Killer of Killers, the well-received adult animated feature directed by Trachtenberg and released on Hulu/Disney+ in June.

	Being in Hall H at Comic-Con was a true dream come true for Trachtenberg. The filmmaker got his start in podcasting and traveled to Comic-Con eight years in a row as a fan in the aughts. As the filmmaker pointed out, he was a witness to several key Hall H moments as a member of the geek community, including the unveiling of the first Iron Man trailer in 2007 and the infamous pen stabbing incident in 2010. And he got to be part of a panel moderated by Kevin Smith, the filmmaker whose work served to popularize geek culture and who has been a Comic-Con fixture since the 1990s.

	Trachtenberg knew that coming to Comic-Con with a movie would be a big deal, but, he said, he had the nagging feeling of “if I go, it has to be something [that] matters.” Well, Predator certainly mattered to the crowd, who ate up the footage, which was not quite finished — some VFX shots were not completed and the score was a temp track.


	Featuring only alien language subtitled for the human crowd, the opening section of the movie shows two Predator brothers engaged in a battle on an alien planet. It's established that one, Dek, is considered the runt of his clan and should be culled. When the older brother fails to do so, the father, who considers the idea of accepting a form of weakness, steps in. In the ensuing Shakesperean struggle, Dek is whisked offworld, setting the stage for the story in which he will fight for his life and honor on a planet where everything is out to kill him.


	“It's the first time we're seeing the Predator in a protagonist role,” said Elle Fanning, who plays a synthetic being that, for lack of a better term, teams up with the Predator on his quest. The actress spends part of the movie on the back of the Predator, played by Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi, this of the Chewbacca and C-3PO scenes in the classic Star Wars movie The Empire Strikes Back.


	The two actors regaled the crowd of how they worked together on the production, with considerable time spent in natural settings and away from soundtsages in New Zealand.


	“Most of the time, we were in nature,” said Trachtenberg. “[The actors] were strapped together going through eel infested trenches.”

	











	Also on stage was Alec Gillis, the FX artist who was mentored by pioneer Stan Winston and has worked with Trachtenberg on all of his Predator films. Gillis and Trachtenberg explained how for the first time in the Predator movies, the face of the creature wasn't practical, always a very challenging task, because nuanced emotional expressions were called for in which the alien was the hero.


	“This time we wanted to make sure we could go to emotional places so we developed a unique system,” explained Trachtenberg. Part of that entailed keeping practical suits but having digital artistry from Weta Workship work on the face.


Predator: Badlands will land in theatres Nov. 7.

""did something,"" Charli captioned the look at the newlyweds' London ceremony.

	Ashley Iasimone



Charli xcx has unveiled a set of photos from her wedding with George Daniel of The 1975.


	On Saturday (July 26), the Brat star publicly shared pictures from the July 19 ceremony, an intimate event attended by the couple's close friends and family at Hackney Town Hall in London.


	“did something,” Charli captioned the glimpse into the day she married George, adding the millennial-preferred version of a heart emoji to her post on Instagram: <3.


	Emoticon preference aside, the pictures capture the two artists' in-love vibes amid their celebration of saying “I do” last weekend.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	The first photo on the slideshow captures Charli's bridal look — made up of a Vivienne Westwood dress, a white bouquet and a pair of her signature sunglasses. Photo two has her husband winking at the camera with a cigarette at his lips. 


	As one might expect, other pics document moments of romance, including the newlyweds kissing. See Charli's full set of wedding photos here.


	The pair announced their engagement in July 2023 when Charli showed off her ring on social media and marked the milestone with the comment “charli xcx and george daniel f—ing for life!!!”


	Both artists recently played Glastonbury, with Daniel — drummer, producer and songwriter with The 1975, and a DJ — headlining the U.K. music festival with the band he's been with since his teen years. The 1975 had first billing on the fest's main Pyramid Stage on June 27; Charli closed down the Other Stage the following night. 


	Though he wasn't seen in pictures from the couple's London wedding ceremony, 1975 frontman Matty Healy hyped Charli's set during the Manchester group's career-spanning gig at Glasto, a performance that left him overcome with emotion. Mid-set, he gave his bandmate's then-fiancée a sweet shoutout in between songs: “Give it up for Charli xcx. That's my best friend.”

	DC Studios stepped in at San Diego Comic-Con where Marvel Studios use to dwell: the late Saturday spot in Hall H with the James Gunn co-run Warner Bros comic book label bringing the second season of Peacemaker. 


	But there was also more reason for glee, for as the panel's moderator Joshua Horowitz observed: “James this is the first time you've been in front of crowd since Superman.” And with that, Hall H erupted in cheer. 


	The panel kicked off with the new trailer for season 2 which shows John Cena's Christopher Smith enjoying a new parallel dimension he's found. It's just like our, and it's even better. It's a place where he can hook up with Jennifer Holland's Harcourt. Meanwhile, back in the real world, Frank Grillo's Rick Flag Sr (from Superman) is out to close the portal in his face-off with Peacemaker. Says Leota in the new trailer to Chris, “No matter how great the grass is over there, you belong here with us.”

	Said Gunn about season 2's Smith: “I really like TV shows where the characters don't just return every season and they're the same exact characters. I want to see growth. I want to see change and sometimes regression,” Gunn said. “And Peacemaker is a different guy this year. He's dealing with the demons he uncovered from the first season and trying to deal with them, and the world is not accepting him the way he is. They aren't accepting him as a hero.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Gunn's Superman leads straight into Peacemaker season 2 with that movie's supporting characters Green Lantern/Guy Gardner (Nathan Fillion), Hawkgirl/Kendra Saunders (Isabel Merced) and Maxwell Lord (Sean Gunn). That trio, as seen in the first teaser, grill Peacemaker for an interview with the Justice League. 

	











	In addition to the trailer show today, Hall H attendees got to see a clip of Harcourt beating up guys in a bar after they try hitting on her with whistles and cat calls. Gunn called it his favorite day on set until they filmed something for Episode 8, which became his new favorite day on set. Holland also teased that she gets to do a Dirty Dancing lift in the opening credits scene.


	In the season one finale, John Cena's Christiopher Smith saves the world from alien butterflies. We also learn that Leota (Danielle Brooks) has a mother, and that's Amanda Waller (Viola Davis). Season one ends with Chris sitting on his stoop, pondering the complexity of life, next to the ghost of his racist dad, Auggie (Robert Patrick) (it's inferred that the guy will be hanging around like an acerbic Obi-Wan Kenobi in season 2). Meanwhile, Goff, the butterfly who was possessing Sophie, has been kept alive by Chris. Chris' father leaves behind a house with an arsenal of weapons and costumes. 


	Per the logline, the new season follows Christopher “Chris” Smith, aka Peacemaker, the vigilante Super Hero as he struggles to reconcile his past with his newfound sense of purpose while continuing to kick righteous evil-doer butt in his misguided quest for peace at any cost.


	Following today's Peacemaker sesh, there's a musical performance from season 2 band Foxy Shazam and Steel Panther.


	Returning Season 2 cast appearing on stage today included Holland, Freddie Stroma, Steve Agee, new cast members Sol Rodriguez and Tim Meadows, Grillo, and Cena. Danielle Brooks came down with illness, seemingly food poisoning, after going out to dinner with Gunn, who got over it by this morning. Cena took the opportunity to chug water to avoid getting sick. The actor then joked about peeing his suit. Gunn also mentioned that Eagley gets his own Lex Luther in Michael Rooker who plays a world renowned eagle hunter.  


	Gunn wrote all eight episodes of Peacemaker and directed three, including the first episode. Gunn, Peter Safran, and Cena are EPs. Greg Mottola, Peter Sollett, and Althea Jones also direct. Based on characters from DC, Peacemaker is produced by Gunn's Troll Court Entertainment and The Safran Company in association with Warner Bros. Television.


Peacemaker happens on Aug. 21. at 9PM ET/PT on HBO Max.

	While Astronomer lost their CEO and HR exec amid the Coldplay concert viral scandal, their marketing team has picked up the slack with a clever new ad that enlists Gwyneth Paltrow, the ex-wife of Chris Martin.


	Hours after the tech company's chief human resources officer Kristin Cabot resigned, Astronomer's socials posted the ad starring Paltrow as a “temporary spokesperson” to let the public know what exactly the now-popular company does.


	“Thank you for your interest in Astronomer,” the actress says. “I've been hired on a very temporary basis to speak on behalf of the 300-plus employees at Astronomer. Astronomer has gotten a lot of questions over the last few days, and they wanted me to answer the most common ones.”

	The questions include “OMG. What the f-” and “How is your social media team hold-,” with Paltrow sidestepping the scandal and instead offering answering about the company itself.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“We are thrilled so many people have an interest in data workflow automation,” Paltrow adds. “We will now be returning to what we do best: Delivering game-changing results for our customers. Thank you for your interest in Astronomer.”


	Andy Byron, the now-former CEO of Astronomer, resigned last week after he and Cabot were put on leave following the viral moment during Coldplay's Boston-area concert.

	In the widely seen and frequently-meme'd moment caught on jumbotron, Byron and Cabot looked to be caught off-guard when their embrace was seen by more than 50,000 people at Gillette Stadium. Their immediate reaction was to duck and turn away from the camera and leaving the frame, which likely led to the speculation and suspicions over their non-professional-appearing relationship.

	











	Coldplay's shows feature “The Jumbotron Song,” where Chris Martin riffs about whomever is captured on the camera. In a clip filmed during the incident, Martin — who was married to Paltrow for 13 years before their “conscious uncoupling” — joked from the stage, “Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy.”
