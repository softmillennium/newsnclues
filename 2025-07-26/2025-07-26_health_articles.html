                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Millions suffering from myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), a debilitating condition often overlooked due to the lack of diagnostic tools, may be closer to personalized care, according to new research that shows how the disease disrupts interactions between the microbiome, immune system, and metabolism. The findings-potentially relevant to long COVID due to its similarity with ME/CFS-come from data on 249 individuals analyzed using a new artificial intelligence (AI) platform that identifies disease biomarkers from stool, blood, and other routine lab tests. "Our study achieved 90% accuracy in distinguishing individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome, which is significant because doctors currently lack reliable biomarkers for diagnosis. Some physicians doubt it as a real disease due to the absence of clear laboratory markers, sometimes attributing it to psychological factors." Dr. Derya Unutmaz, Study Author and Professor, Immunology, The Jackson Laboratory Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterized by severe symptoms that significantly impair physical and mental activities, including persistent fatigue, sleep abnormalities, dizziness, and chronic pain. In the United States, ME/CFS affects between 836,000 and 3.3 million individuals- many undiagnosed-and costs the economy $18 to $51 billion annually due to healthcare expenditures and lost productivity, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Prior studies have noted immune disruptions in ME/CFS, Unutmaz said. This new research builds upon those findings by investigating how the gut microbiome, its metabolites, and immune responses interact. The team linked these connections to 12 classes of patient-reported symptoms, which were aggregated from hundreds of datapoints generated by patient health and lifestyle surveys. These include sleep disturbances, headaches, fatigue, dizziness, and other symptoms the researchers mapped in their entirety from microbiome changes to metabolites, immune responses, and clinical symptoms. "We integrated clinical symptoms with cutting-edge omics technologies to identify new biomarkers of ME/CFS," Oh said. Patients experience a wide range of symptoms that differ in severity and duration, and current methods can't fully capture that complexity." The tool integrates gut metagenomics, plasma metabolomics, immune cell profiles, blood test data, and clinical symptoms from 153 patients and 96 healthy individuals over four years. Immune cell analysis proved most accurate in predicting symptom severity, while microbiome data best predicted gastrointestinal, emotional, and sleep disturbances. The model connected thousands of patient data points, reconstructing symptoms such as pain and gastrointestinal issues, among several others. "Our data indicate these biological disruptions become more entrenched over time," Unutmaz said. The study included 96 age- and gender-matched healthy controls, showing balanced microbiome-metabolite-immune interactions, in contrast to significant disruptions in ME/CFS patients linked to fatigue, pain, emotional regulation issues, and sleep disorders. ME/CFS patients also had lower levels of butyrate, a beneficial fatty acid produced in the gut, along with other nutrients essential for metabolism, inflammation control, and energy. Patients with elevated levels of tryptophan, benzoate, and other markers indicated a microbial imbalance. Heightened inflammatory responses, particularly involving MAIT cells sensitive to gut microbial health, were also observed. "MAIT cells bridge gut health to broader immune functions, and their disruption alongside butyrate and tryptophan pathways, normally anti-inflammatory, suggests a profound imbalance," said Unutmaz. Even though the findings require further validation, they significantly advance scientists' understanding of ME/CFS and provide clearer hypotheses for future research, the authors said. Since animal models can't fully reflect the complex neurological, physiological, immune, and other system disruptions seen in ME/CFS, Oh said it will be crucial to study humans directly to identify modifiable factors and develop targeted treatments. "That means we may be able to intervene-through diet, lifestyle, or targeted therapies-in ways that genomic data alone can't offer." This consistency across diverse data was striking, the authors said. "Despite diverse data collection methods, common disease signatures emerged in fatty acids, immune markers, and metabolites," Oh said. The researchers intend to share their dataset broadly with BioMapAI, which supports analyses across diverse symptoms and diseases, effectively integrating multi-omics data that are difficult to replicate in animal models. "Our goal is to build a detailed map of how the immune system interacts with gut bacteria and the chemicals they produce," Oh said. "By connecting these dots we can start to understand what's driving the disease and pave the way for genuinely precise medicine that has long been out of reach."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new artificial intelligence model can improve the process of drug and vaccine discovery by predicting how efficiently specific mRNA sequences will produce proteins, both generally and in various cell types. Among the most promising areas of health and medicine, the ability to develop new mRNA vaccines and drugs - able to fight viruses, cancers and genetic disorders - involves the frequently challenging process of coaxing cells in a patient's body to produce enough protein from therapeutic mRNA to effectively combat disease. "When we started this project over six years ago, there was no obvious application. It builds the foundation for advances like RiboNN, which only become possible much later." Can Cenik, Associate professor, Molecular Biosciences, University of Texas, Austin In tests spanning more than 140 human and mouse cell types, RiboNN was about twice as accurate at predicting translation efficiency as earlier approaches. This advance may lend researchers the ability to make predictions in cells in ways that could help expedite treatments for cancer and infectious and hereditary diseases. You can think of the way cells in your body make proteins as the way a team of chefs might bake cakes. To cook up a batch of proteins, the chefs in one of your cells (ribosomes) look up the recipe in your own unique protein cookbook (a.k.a. An mRNA vaccine or therapeutic coaxes these chefs in your cells into making proteins. In the case of a vaccine, they might produce a protein found on the surface of a pathogenic virus or cancer cells, essentially waving a big red flag in front of your immune system to make antibodies against the virus or cancer. In the case of a disorder caused by a genetic mutation, they might produce a protein that your body can't properly make on its own, reversing the disorder. Before developing their new predictive model, Cenik and the UT team first curated a set of publicly available data from over 10,000 experiments measuring how efficiently different mRNAs are translated into proteins in different human and mouse cell types. Once they had created this training dataset, AI and machine learning experts from UT and Sanofi came together to develop RiboNN. One goal of the predictive tool is to one day make therapies that are targeted to a particular cell type, said Cenik, who also is affiliate faculty at UT's Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences and a CPRIT scholar, receiving research support from the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas. "Maybe you need a next-generation therapy to be made in the liver or the lung or in immune cells," he said. "This opens up an opportunity to change the mRNA sequence to increase the production of that protein in that cell type." In a companion paper also in Nature Biotechnology, the team demonstrated that mRNAs with related biological functions are translated into proteins at similar levels across different cell types. Scientists have long known that the process of transcribing genes with related functions into mRNAs is coordinated, but it hadn't been previously shown that translating mRNAs into proteins is also coordinated.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A potential target for experimental drugs that block PRMT5 - a naturally occurring enzyme some tumors rely more on for survival - has been identified by researchers with the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute's Cancer Research Center in Washington, D.C. In a study published this month in Cancer Research, Assistant Professor Kathleen Mulvaney of Virginia Tech's Fralin Biomedical Research Institute shared research that could help guide development of new therapies for some treatment-resistant lung, brain, and pancreatic cancers. "Using genetic screening, we found a new drug combination that seemingly works." Kathleen Mulvaney, Assistant Professor, Fralin Biomedical Research Institute, Virginia Tech Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death globally. "With one drug alone, tumors can become resistant really quickly," said Mulvaney, who is a member of the research institute's Cancer Research Center in Washington, D.C. Many of these solid tumors share a genetic trait: They lack CDKN2A and MTAP, two genes that suppress tumors and help regulate cell growth. Mulvaney and colleagues analyzed genetic data from thousands of cancer patients available through the cBioPortal. They applied CRISPR editing tools to look at biological pathways across a range of samples to determine which genes make cancer cells more vulnerable to PRMT5 inhibitors and which combinations could improve response and long-term outcomes. An estimated 5 percent of all cancer patients - about 80,000 to 100,000 per year in the U.S. - can benefit from the therapies identified, according to Mulvaney, who also holds an appointment in biomedical sciences and pathobiology in the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine. Using PRMT5 inhibitors with drugs that block a communication system that tells cancer cells when to grow, divide, or shut down - known as the MAP kinase pathway - scientists identified potential treatments for clinical trials. "We also discovered a number of genes that interact with PRMT5 signaling in cancer that were not previously known," Mulvaney said. In addition to lung, brain, and pancreatic cancers, the treatment shows promise for some types of melanoma and mesothelioma. In both animal models and cell cultures derived from patient tissue, lab members saw success after testing potential therapies. "Only the combinations led to complete regressions."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As artificial intelligence is rapidly developing and becoming a growing presence in healthcare communication, a new study addresses a concern that large language models (LLMs) can reinforce harmful stereotypes by using stigmatizing language. The study from researchers at Mass General Brigham found that more than 35% of responses in answers related to alcohol- and substance use-related conditions contained stigmatizing language. But the researchers also highlight that targeted prompts can be used to substantially reduce stigmatizing language in the LLMs' answers. Results are published in The Journal of Addiction Medicine. It tells patients we care about them and want to help. Stigmatizing language, even through LLMs, may make patients feel judged and could cause a loss of trust in clinicians." Wei Zhang, MD, PhD, Study Corresponding Author and Assistant Professor, Division of Gastroenterology, Mass General Hospital Prompt engineering is a process of strategically crafting input instructions to guide model outputs towards non-stigmatizing language and can be used to train LLMs to employ more inclusive language for patients. This study showed that employing prompt engineering within LLMs reduced the likelihood of stigmatizing language by 88%. For their study, the authors tested 14 LLMs on 60 generated clinically relevant prompts related to alcohol use disorder (AUD), alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), and substance use disorder (SUD). Mass General Brigham physicians then assessed the responses for stigmatizing language using guidelines from the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (both organizations' official names still contain outdated and stigmatizing terminology). Their results indicated that 35.4% of responses from LLMs without prompt engineering contained stigmatizing language, in comparison to 6.3% of LLMs with prompt engineering. Additionally, results indicated that longer responses are associated with a higher likelihood of stigmatizing language in comparison to shorter responses. The effect was seen across all 14 models tested, although some models were more likely than others to use stigmatizing terms. Future directions include developing chatbots that avoid stigmatizing language to improve patient engagement and outcomes. The authors note that future research should involve patients and family members with lived experience to refine definitions and lexicons of stigmatizing language, ensuring LLM outputs align with the needs of those most affected.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>VCU Massey Comprehensive Cancer Center is the first site in the United States to be activated in a global Phase 2a clinical trial evaluating PTX-100 (AKA GGTI-2418), a first-in-class small molecule inhibitor of geranylgeranyl transferase-1 (GGT-1), for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), a rare and often treatment-resistant T-cell lymphoma. "This trial reflects Massey's long-standing commitment to translating basic science discoveries into innovative treatments that can directly benefit patients." Thinking about the journey of PTX-100, Sebti remarked, "As a cancer researcher, there is no greater fulfillment than seeing a therapy you co-invented in the laboratory begin to reach those who need it most. With the launch of this global Phase 2 trial of PTX-100 in CTCL, where new treatments are urgently needed, that long-held dream feels deeply real. To see my academic home, Massey, lead the way as the first U.S. site to open enrollment to this trial, is one of the most exhilarating and humbling moments of my career, and is a powerful reminder of what science can achieve when driven by purpose and passion. PTX-100 is currently believed to be the only GGT-1 inhibitor in clinical development globally, representing a novel class of targeted therapies. After demonstrating safety and early signals of clinical activity in a first-in-human Phase 1 study, PTX-100 advanced into a Phase 1b expansion cohort focused on patients with T-cell lymphomas, where it showed encouraging signs of efficacy and a favorable safety profile. Based on these results, PTX-100 received orphan drug designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration for all T-cell lymphomas, as well as fast-track designation for the treatment of relapsed or refractory mycosis fungoides, the most common form of CTCL. CTCL is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma where immune cells called T cells become cancerous and primarily affect the skin, causing itchy, red, scaly patches that may resemble eczema or psoriasis. Sebti and his colleagues have pioneered the development of GGT-1 inhibitors designed to block these downstream RAS effector pathways, thereby inducing programmed cell death and halting tumor growth in a variety of cancer models. "This global Phase 2a clinical trial of PTX-100 will help provide an extension of care for our patients diagnosed with this rare cancer, for which new therapies are urgently needed," Robert A. Winn, M.D., director and Lipman Chair in Oncology at Massey, said. "We are incredibly proud of Dr. Sebti and his team for bridging the gap between world-class scientific innovation and the communities we serve, ultimately making significant strides in the fight against cancer."
