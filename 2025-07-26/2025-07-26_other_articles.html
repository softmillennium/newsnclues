                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Earlier this month, astronomers made a fascinating discovery: a mysterious object with interstellar origins, now dubbed 3I/ATLAS, that's hurtling toward the inner solar system at extreme speeds. As scientists race to get a better understanding of the rare visitor — it's only the third confirmed interstellar object to have ventured into our solar system — some intriguing theories have emerged. One particularly eyebrow-raising possibility beyond the mainstream suggestions of it being either a comet or an asteroid, as championed by Harvard astronomer and alien hunter Avi Loeb, is that 3I/ATLAS could have been sent by an intelligent, extraterrestrial civilization. In a yet-to-be-peer-reviewed paper, Loeb analyzed the possibility that the object is "alien technology," highlighting its unusual trajectory and what he says may be attempts to brake itself to have a closer look at Earth and Jupiter. (He also emphasized that it might just be a comet or space rock.) "The orbital path of 3I/ATLAS has some very unlikely combination of characteristics, which could quite easily have been simple coincidence, as extremely strange as that ostensibly appears," the paper reads. "The idea of alien probes wandering the cosmos may sound strange, but humans sent out a few ourselves in the 1970s," Webb wrote, pointing out that "both Voyager 1 and 2 have officially left our Solar System, and Pioneer 10 and 11 are not far behind." "So it's not a stretch to think that alien civilisations — if they exist — would have launched their own galactic explorers," she concluded. According to Webb, we'd start out by checking if the object has a "tail" like comets do. But in the absence of any clear indications that 3I/ATLAS is an alien visitor, Webb agrees with Loeb that, as intriguing as the alternative may be, there's a very good chance we're looking at a comet: a celestial wad of ice, dust, and rock. "For now, 3I/ATLAS is likely just an unusually fast, old and icy visitor from a distant system," Webb concluded.

Signing up is free, and your data will never be shared. When we think of alien life, our minds often wander to the realm of science fiction, envisioning little green beings with oversized heads. Yet, the reality might be far more intriguing and microscopic. NASA is funding a groundbreaking study to explore the possibility of alien microbial life within our solar system, specifically on Jupiter's icy moon, Europa. Led by UMass Amherst microbiologist James Holden, this mission delves into the depths of Earth's oceanic mysteries to better understand what life might look like on Europa. James Holden brings a wealth of knowledge to NASA's mission, having dedicated his career to studying rare microbes in Earth's deep-sea vents. These vents, located a mile below the ocean's surface, offer a unique environment devoid of light and oxygen—conditions that Holden believes could mirror those on Europa. Holden's laboratory at UMass Amherst is equipped to simulate these harsh conditions, providing insights into how life might thrive on Europa. Holden's research focuses on the potential for life-supporting conditions beneath Europa's icy crust. Astronomers speculate that a salty, liquid ocean lies beneath Europa's frozen surface and that this ocean might be in contact with a hot, molten core. This interaction could create an environment similar to Earth's deep-sea vents, where life might flourish. With NASA's Europa Clipper satellite set to explore the moon's habitability, Holden's work is crucial in understanding what alien life could look like. “NASA Sounds the Alarm”: Unprecedented Planetary Surge Linked to Unknown Deep-Earth Force Now Spreading at Global Scale For decades, Holden has utilized submarines to collect microbial samples from the ocean floor, both human-occupied and robotic. These samples are brought back to his lab, where he recreates the extreme conditions found at deep-sea vents. “I've been investigating deep-sea volcanoes since 1988,” Holden states, emphasizing his commitment to uncovering Earth's microbial secrets. The significance of this research extends beyond mere curiosity. Understanding these microbes' energy acquisition methods could reveal new biochemical pathways, which might be present in Europan life. Holden's lab has reconstructed lightless, oxygen-less conditions that mimic those of Europa, offering a glimpse into what alien life might entail. “This Sensor Sees the Unseeable”: NASA's Quantum Gravity Tech Set to Revolutionize Earth Monitoring With Unmatched Precision Holden's research also delves into the diverse chemical processes that might sustain Europan microbial life. On Earth, deep-sea microbes utilize hydrogenases—specialized enzymes that break down hydrogen for energy. One of the challenges lies in understanding how these chemical processes contribute to an organism's physiology. By comprehending the chemistry that underpins these organisms, scientists can better predict what alien life might resemble. “These Creatures Could Rewrite the Rules of Life”: Deep-Sea Microbes on Earth Mirror What May Be Thriving Beneath Europa's Ice By understanding the conditions that support life on our planet, scientists can make educated assumptions about the possibilities elsewhere in our solar system. As we stand on the brink of potentially uncovering life on Europa, one must wonder: What secrets do our own planet's depths hold, and what could they reveal about life in the universe?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An eyewitness to the supposed crash-landing of a UFO in a small Pennsylvania town nearly 60 years ago now claims investigators have made new, startling discoveries about the incident. On December 9, 1965, people in seven US states and Canada reported seeing a giant fiery object lighting up the night sky. Ronnie Strubel, 82, lived in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, at the time and described it as a 'fireball with a red rooster tail behind it'. Contrary to more recent reports where witnesses claim UFOs they saw were unnaturally quick, Strubel told Daily Mail the object he saw was moving about as fast as a commercial airplane. 'It only took like 15 or 20 minutes for us to get out to the site, and the military was already there,' he said. But in the decades since, this strange event likely seen by thousands of people has largely been erased from the collective memory. That is, until the History Channel aired a documentary on the subject earlier this month, where a mix of experts used modern technology to uncover what may have happened all those years ago in Kecksburg. Many locals who claim to have seen the UFO pass over Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, say it looked like an acorn (Pictured: A model of the UFO is seen displayed in town) Kecksburg is a small, unincorporated town in Westmoreland County. The 42-minute long episode, titled 'Pennsylvania's Roswell', was part of reality TV series Beyond Skinwalker Ranch, a show that focuses on sites around the country where there has been supposed paranormal activity. Strubel and another local, Bill Weaver, were featured in the episode. They were the ones that seemed to be in charge,' Weaver said. 'While we were standing there watching what was going on, the state police and the military came up to us and they told us, "If you don't move, we're going to confiscate your car." Hosts Andy Bustamante, an ex-CIA officer, and Paul Beban, an award-winning journalist, unpacked much of the lore surrounding the UFO sighting and crash. This included the persisting claim from longtime residents that the object they saw was shaped like an acorn. Technologist Pete Kelsey claimed that this blue area was abnormally flat compared to the rest of the surrounding topography Very early reports quoted astronomers claiming it was merely a meteor, but this didn't hold much credibility because of the unprecedented military presence documented by witnesses and local media. NASA still maintains that it was likely a meteor, but also acknowledges speculation that it could have been Soviet satellite. Kelsey used LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) imaging from a drone and slam scanner to get a topographic map of the ground, which would reveal possible impact points. Those kinds of things do not occur in nature,' he said. Strubel revealed the findings at this past weekend's 20th annual Kecksburg UFO Festival, an event he founded with permission from the fire department in 2005 Pictured: An alien themed parade at the 2013 Kecksburg UFO Festival How is there a radio signal in one place that doesn't exist just a few feet away? That's not how radio energy works,' Bustamante said. 'We might have actually found the real crash site.' Strubel revealed these findings at this past weekend's 20th annual Kecksburg UFO Festival, an event he founded with permission from the fire department in 2005. Strubel himself is a 50-year veteran of the Kecksburg Volunteer Fire Department, once serving as chief. The first two days of the festival were not solely dedicated to the extraterrestrial, with attendees enjoying a cornhole competition, a parade, fireworks and even a hotdog eating contest. And this was our idea for some kind of event to draw a little bit of money into the community. So we started the UFO Fest,' Strubel said. By posting your comment you agree to our house rules.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's been 50 years since Jimmy Hoffa first disappeared, and his case remains one of the most infamous and vexing unsolved mysteries in U.S. history. The ex-Teamsters boss left his cottage home in suburban Lake Orion, Mich., near Detroit on July 30, 1975 for a 2 p.m. meeting at the Machus Red Fox Restaurant in nearby Bloomfield Hills. He was reportedly gathering with a group of gangsters, including Anthony “Tony Pro” Provenzano, a New Jersey-based capo for the Genovese crime family, and Detroit mob boss Anthony “Tony Jack” Giacalone. At around 2:15 p.m., Hoffa, 62,  called his wife, Josephine, from the restaurant's parking lot to tell her no one showed up. It was the last time anyone ever heard from him. Over the past five decades, the agency has assigned hundreds of agents to the case who've debunked conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory – while costing taxpayers tens of millions of dollars, estimated Hoffa historian and author Scott Burnstein. Just this week a new theory emerged — that Hoffa's corpse was literally turned into mincemeat, The Post can reveal. Burnstein — who believes the hit on Hoffa was carried out by Detroit's Tocco–Zerilli crime family — said the case's mythology took on a life of its own because  remains were never found. “This was something they thought was a perfect crime – and in a lot of ways it was the perfect crime,” he told The Post, referring to the crime syndicate also known as “Detroit Partnership.” “I just don't think they anticipated people would still be talking about it 50 years later, and this is a mob family that thrives in the shadows. On Wednesday, Burnstein teamed up with former federal prosecutor Richard Convertino and ex-mob soldier Nove Tocco at an event at Macomb Community College in Warren, Mich., to reveal the latest theory to surface about what happened to Hoffa. They claimed Hoffa was whacked by late Detroit mobster Anthony “Tony Pal” Palazzolo — and the body ground up in a sausage grinder at the former Detroit Sausage Company Palazzolo used for his operations. The site is now part of a local jail complex. Before the FBI began its search, Moldea and Fox News contracted teams of investigators to use ground-penetrating radar to check for anomalies under the site, such as steel drums. Burnstein said he has great respect for Moldea's work but believes the murder and body disposal was done locally — not out of state. “I think people are making this way more complex than it actually was,” Bernstein said. Besides Hoffa's bid to reclaim the Teamsters' presidency — a title he held from 1959 to 1971 —  Burnstein said his sources told him there's another reason mobsters wanted Hoffa dead: He was a “confidential informant working for the FBI.” James P. Hoffa, son of the late Teamsters boss, told the Detroit News he doesn't buy that his father's remains were taken out of state, and he denied that his father planned to testify for the feds. He's proud of the “legacy” his father left behind, but regrets the disappearance became comedy fodder for late-night television and that his mother died in 1980 with a “broken heart.” “My father went to a meeting he shouldn't have gone to, and he was murdered,” said the younger Hoffa, 84, who served as Teamsters president from 1998-2022. “I know there are a lot of theories out there, but we've stopped trying to figure out who did what to whom.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>False claim that Brigitte Macron was born a man has roots in pandemic-era France as distrust of politicians peaked The Macrons' US lawsuit attacked what it called the “verifiably false and devastating lies” being repeated online by Owens that Brigitte Macron, 72, was born a man. The lawsuit said evidence clearly disproved this “grotesque narrative”, which had become “a campaign of global humiliation” and “relentless bullying on a worldwide scale”. The case prompted broader questions this week about how conspiracy theories spread worldwide, whether they can be stopped in the courts and what this false narrative, which began in France after the Covid pandemic, says about French society's distrust in politicians. “What's new is that for the first time, Emmanuel Macron has joined his wife in taking legal action.” Trogneux, 80, lives in the northern French town of Amiens, where he grew up with Brigitte and four other siblings in a family famous for its local chocolate business. Owens, whose podcast and social media channels have an audience of millions, said this week she stood by her narrative. In December 2021, a woman who used the name Amandine Roy and called herself a “spiritual medium”, broadcast a four-hour YouTube interview with Natacha Rey, 51, who had worked previously for a small essential oils business and described herself as “an independent investigative journalist, self-taught, and not from the inner circle of mainstream media”. Rey said she had spent three years investigating Brigitte Macron, after questioning the first lady's body-shape in photos. Rey said she believed Brigitte Macron was actually a man called Jean-Michel Trogneux. Within hours, the interview had 500,000 views and the hashtag #Jean-MichelTrogneux was trending on social media in France, promoted by, among others, some far-right and anti-vaccine accounts. “There was a deeper societal problem at that time in France: the mistrust of political, media and economic institutions,” Anizon said. “There had been years of political health scandals worldwide and in France – from a contaminated blood scandal to the Mediator weight-loss drug. Many people had gradually reached a point of distrust, switching off traditional mainstream media and turning instead to online accounts – Covid and vaccine mistrust increased that.” Brigitte Macron, who is 24 years older, first met Emmanuel Macron when she was a French teacher at his Jesuit secondary school in Amiens, directing him in a school play. In early 2022, after the first viral video allegations, Brigitte Macron and her brother, Jean-Michel Trogneux, filed a defamation case in France against Roy and Rey, who both denied wrongdoing. This was the case in May, when video images appeared to show Brigitte pushing her husband away with both hands on his face before they disembarked from a plane on a tour of Southeast Asia. Macron dismissed the incident as play-fighting, telling reporters that “we are squabbling and, rather, joking with my wife”, and that it had been overblown into “a sort of geo-planetary catastrophe”. Brigitte Macron has not spoken publicly on the false gender claims since 2022 when she told French radio, RTL, that allegations that “I am my brother” were an “impossible” attack on her parents' family tree.</p>

The most memorable part of the teaser was a powerful declaration by Antony Starr's Homelander, in which he bellows how “this is a safer, more god-fearing nation” to an unseen crowd. The country is under martial law, and Homelander has rounded up the Boys and other supes who don't want to “make America super again.” In the quick teaser, at least one “Gen V” cast member was spotted: London Thor as Godolkin University student Jordan Li. That makes sense, as “Gen V” stars Maddie Phillips and Asa Germann appeared in “The Boys” Season 4 finale as pro-Homelander enforcers who turned on their fellow classmates and former friends.
