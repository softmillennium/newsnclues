                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Retired CIA official Susan Miller, an author of the agency's 2017 intelligence report on Russian election meddling, is vowing to fight any potential criminal charges brought by the Trump administration. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has accused the Obama administration of manufacturing the intelligence report, which assessed that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to help Donald Trump, and said she made criminal referrals to the Justice Department. “My team and I, just yesterday, had a few drinks and talked about that, and talked about what lawyers we'd be looking for, if that happens,” Miller told CNN's Kaitlan Collins on “The Source” on Friday. Pushing back against Gabbard's accusations, Miller said that no one – including then-President Barack Obama or then-CIA Director John Brennan – had told her team what conclusion to reach in their report. She added that she and her team would have quit if they had faced such pressure. Miller said the intelligence that helped them reach their conclusion “was extremely sound and it was verified.” Miller also said her team briefed Trump at the time. She went on to say that the report's findings were “not at all” based on the so-called Steele dossier, which was included as an addendum. The infamous dossier was written by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, and funded by Hillary Clinton's campaign. It alleged coordination between the Russian government and people associated with the Trump campaign, though its ultimate credibility was limited. While Miller's team “could determine that 100%” Russia tried to influence the 2016 election, it's indeterminable whether Moscow's efforts worked, Miller said. “But the bottom line is, yes, they tried to influence it. No, unless we poll every voter as to why they voted, we can't tell you if that worked. And we just left it at that,” she told CNN. In a statement, the White House praised Gabbard and described the 2017 intelligence report and its findings as a “total hoax and political witch hunt to snub President Trump's historic first term in office.” “I think it is wrong in every single way,” Miller told CNN in response and warned of Gabbard's attacks against the report and its findings. “What Tulsi is saying is: ‘We only want to hear anything that's pro-Trump, pro-Trump policy … pro-current Republican Party from any of our intel services, and if we hear anything that's not that, then we're going to come after you.' And so, what analyst wants to put his or her, their name on any paper now?” she said. We had rigorous analytic reviews by our then-head of analysis.

Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Ranger Suárez (55) throws during the first inning of a baseball game against the New York Yankees, Saturday, July 26, 2025, in New York. NEW YORK (AP) — Bryce Harper homered deep into the right-field bleachers and Kyle Schwarber hit a two-run double after New York's 10th error in five games, sparking the Philadelphia Phillies to a 9-4 win Saturday over the reeling Yankees, who avoided a major injury scare with captain Aaron Judge. Trea Turner drove in two runs and Edmundo Sosa also homered for the Phillies, who opened a 9-1 lead. Schwarber had six RBIs and Turner was 6 for 11 as Philadelphia outscored New York 21-9 in the first two games of the three-game series. Ranger Suárez (8-4) allowed one run and seven hits in 5 2/3 innings with eight strikeouts and one walk, throwing a season-high 108 pitches. His elbow has been bothering him since a throw Tuesday at Toronto, and manager Aaron Boone said the two-time AL MVP had a scan that revealed a flexor strain but no damage to the ulnar collateral ligament. Judge will go on the injured list and be the designated hitter initially when he returns, Boone said. New York began the day a season-high 5 1/2 games behind AL East-leading Toronto and dropped to 3-5 since the All-Star break. Schwarber doubled after second baseman Jazz Chisholm Jr. bobbled Turner's potential inning-ending, double-play grounder in the seventh, Chisholm's 12th error this season. Sosa hit a two-run homer in the seventh off Allan Winans and Giancarlo Stanton hit a two-run drive against Daniel Robert in the bottom half. Sosa left with a bruised back after the third baseman was elbowed by left fielder Brandon Marsh in a collision while catching Chisholm's seventh-inning popup. New York LHP Carlos Rodón (10-7, 3.10) and Philadelphia RHP Zack Wheeler (9-3, 2.39) start Sunday's series finale.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The poll from the Wall Street Journal found 63% of voters have an unfavorable view of the Democratic Party, compared to 33% who hold a favorable view. Enthusiasm is also on the Republicans' side — just 8% of voters view the Democrats “very favorably,” while 19% view the Republicans “very favorably.” The poll found another pattern — Republicans were able to reap the benefits of Trump's popularity while insulating themselves from his more unpopular stances. For example, voters disapproved of Trump's handling of tariffs by a massive 17 points, yet trusted Republicans more than Democrats on the issue by 7 points. Trump's handling of inflation has an 11-point deficit, yet voters trust Republicans more on the issue by 10 points. The only issues Democrats enjoyed more confidence in were healthcare and vaccines. The party has been unable to come up with a coherent message after being routed by Trump and the Republicans in November, failing to satisfy centrists looking to moderate their image and leftists hoping to intensify their message. Polls on Trump's approval rating have varied drastically over the past month, with the Wall Street Journal putting it at 46%, though substantially higher than at this point in his first term, when it was at 40%. The poll surveyed 1,500 registered voters from July 16-20. The margin of error is plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.</p>

Cameroon Justice minister Maurice Kamto prepares to sign documents transferring the authority Bakassi peninsula to Cameroon in Archibong, Nigeria, Aug. 14, 2006. YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) — Cameroon 's electoral commission on Saturday rejected the candidacy of Maurice Kamto in the upcoming presidential election, fueling fears of unrest and increasing the likelihood of another Biya victory. Kamto, a former government minister, is seen as the main challenger to long-serving President Paul Biya. The electoral commission, ELECAM, said it approved 13 presidential candidates, excluding Kamto. Kamto, who has two days to appeal, was considered Biya's strongest rival in past elections. He came second during the last presidential election in 2018 with 14% of the vote, while Biya cruised to victory with over 70% in an election marred by irregularities and a low turnout. Biya, 92, the world's oldest serving head of state, said last month he would seek reelection on Oct. 12 despite rumors that his health is failing. He has been in power since 1982, nearly half his lifetime. Biya's rule has left a lasting impact on Cameroon. His government has faced various challenges, including allegations of corruption and a deadly secessionist conflict in the nation's English-speaking provinces that has forced thousands out of school. Security forces were deployed around the ELECAM headquarters and along major roads in Yaoundé, the capital, and in Douala, the economic hub. The United Nations Department of Safety and Security had warned Friday that the announcement could trigger protests in the capital.</p>

Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma responded to reports that some Democratic governors will no longer pay their National Governors Association (NGA) dues. Colorado Springs, Colo. – Incoming chair of the National Governors Association (NGA), Gov. Kevin Stitt, R-Okla., is "disappointed" that some Democratic governors might stop paying their dues to the bipartisan group. The Atlantic reported ahead of the NGA's summer meeting in Colorado Springs, Colo., that at least two Democrats, Govs. Tim Walz of Minnesota and Laura Kelly of Kansas, plan to stop paying their dues when asked to renew their membership this month over the NGA's response to President Donald Trump's second term. "We shouldn't be playing politics like they do in Washington, D.C.," Stitt told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview at the summer meeting. "But sometimes, if you're a governor running for president or a higher office, you make it political." As Walz weighs a third gubernatorial run, the former vice presidential candidate has remained a leading critic of Trump's administration since losing the White House alongside Vice President Kamala Harris last year. Kevin Stitt spoke to Fox News Digital during the NGA summer meeting in Colorado Springs, Colo.  (Deirdre Heavey/Fox News Digital) Jared Polis of Colorado prepares to cede his chairmanship to Stitt, a Republican, at this weekend's summer meeting. Wes Moore, D-Md., is set to become vice chair. "I would tell anybody, listen, do you want your leaders to take their ball and go home just because they get mad at something? "Listen, this isn't the time to take our ball and go home. Let's sit down and debate what the best policies [are] going forward," Stitt added. The Oklahoma governor said it can be "frustrating" when Democrats are constantly targeting Trump, but as a business leader, he said there are plenty of instances in which governors can find common ground, including a reduction of the United States' more than $36 trillion in debt. Jared Polis discusses American education with Education Secretary Linda McMahon at the NGA Summer meeting in Colorado Springs, Colo., on Friday, July 25, 2025. Janet Mills of Maine clashed with Trump over biological men playing in women's sports and, more recently, when Trump authorized the National Guard to California to amid the anti-ICE protests. "Every public statement NGA issues reflects bipartisan consensus. So far this year, all but one statement has had that consensus, and when governors don't agree, we simply don't issue one. That's how we preserve our role as a bipartisan convener, a principle we won't compromise," Wohlschlegel explained. Thirteen Republican and seven Democratic leaders planned to attend the summer meeting, featuring discussions with Education Secretary Linda McMahon and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Jared Polis of Colorado listens at the National Governors Association (NGA) winter meeting in Washington, D.C. (Fox News/Charlie Creitz) No allegations of misconduct, governance failure or mismanagement have been raised." He added that "during this polarizing time, bipartisan organizations are needed more than ever, and NGA must continue to demonstrate value to all governors and effectively communicate governors' opinions on various matters with the public and the federal government." Abegail Cave, a spokesperson for Stitt, told Fox News Digital ahead of the NGA that "people seem to forget NGA is a bipartisan organization, not a political one." Fox News Digital reached out to Walz and Kelly for comment but did not immediately receive a response. Deirdre Heavey is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.

In this photo provided by Olivia Ellis, she wears a custom corset top that she painted to one of Beyoncé's ‘Cowboy Carter' tour performances at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., May 25, 2025. In this photo provided by Kinitra D. Brooks, standing at right, she poses for a photo dressed up for one of Beyoncé's ‘Cowboy Carter' tour performances with Tia Cordier, from left, Cincia Kerr and Isabella Kerr in Houston, June 29, 2025. In this photo provided by Tanazha Baylis, she wears a matching outfit with Aria Brown, left, for one of Beyoncé's ‘Cowboy Carter' tour performances at Soldier Field in Chicago, May 2025. “Who they came to see?” Beyoncé asks as she performs her 2023 single “My House” during the Cowboy Carter tour. Blue Ivy Carter, the Grammy-winning artist's 13-year-old daughter, is more present than ever on stage, and fans are impressed by the growth from her first performance years ago to now. Isabella Kerr, 15, has admired Beyoncé for years, but said she attended the Cowboy Carter tour specifically to experience Blue Ivy's moves in person. Everything about her when she's on stage is electrifying,” said Kerr. The tour's 30 previous shows have had fans buzzing that Blue Ivy is well on her way to being a next generation powerhouse. Blue first graced the stage at 11 years old during her mother's 2023 Renaissance tour, appearing during the legacy-celebrating anthems “My Power” and “Black Parade.” Supporters anticipated her performance at each stop. She performed again during “Beyoncé Bowl,” the NFL Christmas Day Halftime Show that was just nominated for four Emmy Awards. “Even the difference between the Renaissance Tour and now, you can tell she's really grown in her confidence,” said fan and artist Olivia Ellis. “You can tell she has a different vibe about her.” On the Cowboy Carter tour, she can almost be mistaken for one of Beyoncé's professional dancers. She is on stage for nearly every song and has a solo recreating her mother's choreography from her 2006 “Déjà-vu” music video, a nod to the undeniable similarities between the two. Online videos of Blue display professionalism comparable to her mother's during the Cowboy Carter tour. During a rainy New Jersey stop, she brought out towels to dry her area of the stage before nailing her “America Has a Problem” choreography. In another unexpected moment during a Chicago show, her earring got caught on Beyoncé's hair. In “Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé,” fans were given a behind-the-scenes look at the decision-making process the first time Blue was allowed to perform. “She worked to be on stage, and look at her now.

Brooks, standing at right, she poses for a photo dressed up for one of Beyoncé's ‘Cowboy Carter' tour performances with Tia Cordier, from left, Cincia Kerr and Isabella Kerr in Houston, June 29, 2025. At last month's Cowboy Carter Paris stop, members of the Beyhive and Ivy League finally got what they had been asking for — Blue Ivy merchandise. At the MetLife Stadium show, Ellis wore a custom corset top she painted, showcasing Blue Ivy and her 8-year-old sister, Rumi Carter, on stage with Beyoncé during “Protector,” a track from the “Cowboy Carter” album that Rumi is featured on. In this photo provided by Olivia Ellis, she wears a custom corset top that she painted to one of Beyoncé's ‘Cowboy Carter' tour performances at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., May 25, 2025. “It's just really cool to see her as a mom because we've all grown up with Beyoncé, and now it's like her show is kind of like a family affair.” Blue Ivy's confidence and professionalism are not only a testament to her hard work, but Beyoncé's motherhood. Mother-daughter duos around the globe filled stadium seats, excited to watch Beyoncé and her daughter display their strong bond for the world to see. Tanazha Baylis took her now 11-year-old daughter, Aria Brown, to the Renaissance tour, where she did not miss a beat dancing along to Blue Ivy's “My Power” choreography. Brown was so determined to attend the Cowboy Carter Tour that she started selling popular toys, such as slime and Squishmallows, and saving her money. In this photo provided by Tanazha Baylis, she wears a matching outfit with Aria Brown, left, for one of Beyoncé's ‘Cowboy Carter' tour performances at Soldier Field in Chicago, May 2025. Baylis, who says she has always been a big fan, is happy to share these experiences with her daughter. All we saw were people trying to put limitations on her,” said Brooks. “I think one of the things that Beyoncé wants us to do and what she wants for Blue is for us to not put those limitations on Blue.”</p>

Rebecca De Mornay is not holding back when it comes to the reboot of one of her most iconic films. De Mornay claimed that nobody reached out to her about the reboot. "It felt like a betrayal, like how dare you [have] somebody else be playing that part." Rebecca De Mornay approaches Ernie Hudson in a scene from "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle." De Mornay delivered a chilling performance as the vengeful nanny Peyton Flanders in the thriller, alongside Annabella Sciorra, Julianne Moore, Matt McCoy, Ernie Hudson and more. Her comments come at a time when Hollywood continues to create remakes of fan favorites, instead of producing original stories. Rebecca De Mornay knits as she glances back at Annabella Sciorra in a scene from the film. De Mornay continued to slam the Hollywood reboots, as she recently starred in the thriller "Saint Clare," opposite Bella Thorne and Ryan Phillippe. That's why I really like ‘Saint Clare.' I haven't seen anything like it before," she explained. So let's just do that one again,' rather than coming up with a new story. So that kind of bugs me a little," she admitted. Rebecca De Mornay and Tom Cruise in a scene from the film 'Risky Business', 1983. The beloved musical drama has seen multiple versions on the big screen since its original debut in 1937. In 1951, the project was created for television with Kathleen Crowley and Conrad Nagel in the lead roles. Just a few years later, the story returned with Judy Garland and James Mason in the 1954 classic. Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson offered their own spin in 1976, while Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper drew in a new generation with their 2018 rendition. Rebecca De Mornay voices concerns about Hollywood's remake culture after learning she wasn't cast for "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" reboot. "We tend to think a movie is one cast. I guess it doesn't have to be, if it's a really good story, a good script," she said. "I guess, it doesn't have to, but I just wish that there was also more imagination with new scripts, because it feels like people are just falling back on what once were." Reps for De Mornay didn't immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. Stephanie Giang-Paunon is an Entertainment Writer for Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An enlightening analysis by pollsters John and Jim McLaughlin suggests that how voters view President Donald Trump six months into the job is largely influenced by which media they rely on. If Fox and Newmax are the source, Trump is on a great run, scoring big wins. If it's CNN and MSNBC, he is sinking under the weight of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. In their opinion piece for Newsmax, the pollsters said that the media-fed political divide has stalled Trump's rise in polls. They wrote, “despite legislative wins and economic improvements, Trump's approval ratings face a ceiling.” They said that consumers of center-right media think things are fine, with 69% feeling that the country is headed in the right direction. Meanwhile, just 30% of those who consume liberal media agree. In this week's White House Report Card, our graders show exactly what the McLaughlins have found. Democratic pollster John Zogby, in grading the week an “F,” said the Epstein scandal is dragging Trump down. “Glug” was his rating on his “Drowning Meter.” Conservative grader Jed Babbin, giving the president an A-minus, said the affair rates a big “meh,” and said Trump is getting a lot done, especially in calling out those who have long tried to undermine him, notably former President Barack Obama. President Donald Trump got the best news he'd received since Hillary Rodham Clinton lost the 2016 election. The Russia hoax was created out of whole cloth, lies from beginning to end. It alleged that Trump was in league with Russian President Vladimir Putin and that by their collusion, Putin intended to tilt the election toward Trump. Putin wanted Hillary to be president (duh!) because she was vastly weaker than Trump and he could play her like a fiddle. It was all nonsense but had a profound slowing effect on Trump and his whole first term as president. What he needs now is like what Doc Holliday prescribed for Wyatt Earp as the good guys began to win in Tombstone. It's a word you should look up. Congress went home rather than deal with the Jeffrey Epstein files. (If Trump had been in them anywhere, Biden would have leaked the files joyously.) We began the week with a statement from the brother of a convicted pedophile saying that his brother (Jeffrey Epstein) ended his friendship with future President Donald Trump because he was a “crook.” And it doesn't get any better for Trump as the Epstein affair spreads. He denied he sent a friendly birthday card to Epstein with a lewd cartoon, emphatically arguing that it could not have been him because he didn't doodle. But we got to see that the president is actually quite a good doodler and some were auctioned off for charity. Then we saw a flurry of pictures of the future president all smiles with Epstein and his “associate,” convicted child trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. For her part, Maxwell was deposed by Trump's former attorney, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche this week. This movie is getting tiresome and the president and his toadies in Congress have ensured that it will be shown every day through September. Fed chairs are supposed to be independent and presidents are not supposed to confront them — even suggesting that they are going to not renew them for another term. But that is tame compared with Trump's reaction to calls for release of all documents related to his relationship with Epstein. He also argued that his predecessor Barack Obama should be investigated for treason trying to pull off a coup against the newly elected Trump in 2017. It will also immediately reduce the numbers of Americans with health insurance by 11 million, threatening the quality of healthcare they receive and the shuttering of rural and smaller hospitals/urgent care facilities.

Jennifer Rogers-Etcheverry, Rogers' great-granddaughter, tells Fox News Digital that making movies ‘paid the bills' for the country boy at heart. At the time of his death, '30s star Will Rogers was the highest-paid actor in Hollywood, but all he really wanted was to be a cowboy, according to his great-granddaughter, Jennifer Rogers-Etcheverry. "I think the Hollywood scene paid the bills," Rogers-Etcheverry, who lives in her great-grandfather's native Oklahoma, where he is known as "Oklahoma's favorite son," told Fox News Digital. "And he was contracted with Fox to make several movies, which he did not get to finish his contract, but he would crank them out just so he could go travel, go right on the ranch, go play polo, go do something." At the time of his death, '30s star Will Rogers was the highest-paid actor in Hollywood, but all he really wanted was to be a cowboy, according to his great-granddaughter, Jennifer Rogers-Etcheverry. "I don't think that his passion was being a movie star," Rogers-Etcheverry said. "His passion was out being with the people." Rogers was the highest-paid actor who had made more than 70 movies when he died in a plane crash in 1935 at 55 years old. But he was also an author and a newspaper columnist with more than 40 million readers a day, and he wrote six books. "I don't know when the man slept," Rogers-Etcheverry joked. WATCH: ‘30s star Will Rogers was ‘highest-paid actor' at the time of his plane crash death, but it wasn't his passion That's all he ever wanted to be was a cowboy. And I think he just stuck to his roots. Will Rogers was close with aviator Charles Lindbergh. She said her grandfather always told her that when Rogers came back to his ranch, "he was Dad, he was not Will Rogers. He was just a nice, good ‘ol boy." "As he said, he entertained the audience by trick-roping while the girls changed from nothing into nothing, and he was told not to say a word," she said. Wil Rogers with his wife and kids in 1934. She said one time, when he messed up a trick that he joked, "'Hey guys, sorry I got all my feet through but one,' and the audience laughed, and he immediately fueled off that laughter." WATCH: ‘30s star Will Rogers got into Hollywood after making off-the-cuff remark while trick-roping in live show Soon after, he got a speaking role, quoting what he'd read in the newspapers, making fun of the president of the United States and more until celebrities started coming to his show, which were always sold out, she said. "And it just led from there," Rogers-Etcheverry said. Aside from starring in dozens of silent films and talkies, like "A Connecticut Yankee" with Maureen O'Sullivan and "Steamboat Round the Bend," Rogers was also an avid flying enthusiast who was friends with aviator Charles Lindbergh. Will Rogers with Myrna Loy in "A Connecticut Yankee." After the infamous Lindbergh baby kidnapping and murder, Rogers invited the aviator's family to stay at his California ranch so they could have some privacy. "Because, of course, the press was all over it," Rogers-Etcheverry explained. And I don't know exactly how long they stayed there, but they did spend quite a bit of time there when all that was happening." Rogers died in a plane crash in Alaska while surveying mail routes with Oklahoma aviator Wiley Post in August 1935, and it "shut down not only the United States, it shut down the world," Rogers-Etcheverry said. "Oklahoma's Favorite Son" always wanted to be a cowboy, Will Rogers' great-granddaughter said. When she got involved in the family business, keeping Rogers' memory alive, Rogers-Etcheverry said that people who were older told her they remembered being children when Rogers died. "And they said to me, ‘That's the only time I've ever seen my dad cry or my mom cry.' And I think it was because he was a man that just, he made you feel good. He brought people together in a way that no one has ever been able to do since." WATCH: Early ‘30s star Will Rogers never forgot his cowboy roots in Oklahoma, great-granddaughter says While he was a "common man," Rogers frequently entertained celebrities at his California ranch. Will Rogers plays with a lasso while writing notes in 1920. Rogers' widow, Betty, donated his ranch and land to the state in 1944, and it became Will Rogers State Historic Park, which still attracts celebrities to this day, Rogers-Etcheverry said.

I have two children and two grandchildren, and if it wasn't for me, they would have no idea who Will Rogers is," she said. "You know, in Oklahoma it's a little bit easier. He's Oklahoma's favorite son, and there's not anything back here that isn't named after him. But you get outside the state, it's a little more challenging."

Fox News senior national correspondent Rich Edson reports on the newly declassified Russiagate documents, Democrats' dismissal of the ‘historic scandal' and more on ‘Special Report.' Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard declassified a slew of documents this month, revealing that Obama administration officials "manufactured" intelligence to push the Trump-Russia collusion narrative. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard talks to reporters in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House July 23, 2025, in Washington, DC., after releasing newly declassified documents about the Trump-Russia collusion "hoax." Here's a look at the newly declassified records: One instance was on Dec. 7, 2016, weeks after the election. Then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper's talking points stated, "Foreign adversaries did not use cyberattacks on election infrastructure to alter the U.S. presidential election outcome." Fox News Digital obtained a declassified copy of the Presidential Daily Brief, which was prepared by the Department of Homeland Security, with reporting from the CIA, Defense Intelligence Agency, FBI, National Security Agency, Department of Homeland Security, State Department and open sources, for Obama, dated Dec. 8, 2016. President Barack Obama speaks with reporters in the Oval Office July 19, 2016, after a meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch and FBI Director James Comey. "We assess that Russian and criminal actors did not impact recent U.S. election results by conducting malicious cyber activities against election infrastructure," the Presidential Daily Brief stated. "Russian Government-affiliated actors most likely compromised an Illinois voter registration database and unsuccessfully attempted the same in other states." But the brief stated that it was "highly unlikely" the effort "would have resulted in altering any state's official vote result." The brief stated that cyber criminals "tried to steal data and to interrupt election processes by targeting election infrastructure, but these actions did not achieve a notable disruptive effect." Fox News Digital obtained declassified, but redacted, communications from the FBI in the Presidential Daily Brief, stating that it "should not go forward until the FBI" had shared its "concerns." Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former CIA Director John Brennan appear at a public hearing in Washington. The following day, Dec. 9, 2016, a meeting convened in the White House Situation Room, with the subject line starting: "Summary of Conclusions for PC Meeting on a Sensitive Topic (REDACTED.)" The meeting included top officials in the National Security Council, Clapper, then-CIA Director John Brennan, then-National Security Advisor Susan Rice, then-Secretary of State John Kerry, then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch, then-Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, among others, to discuss Russia. President Obama, accompanied by Secretary of State John Kerry, meets with veterans and Gold Star Mothers to discuss the Iran nuclear deal in the Roosevelt Room at the White House in Washington Sept. 10, 2015. The declassified meeting record, obtained by Fox News Digital, revealed that principals "agreed to recommend sanctioning of certain members of the Russian military intelligence and foreign intelligence chains of command responsible for cyber operations as a response to cyber activity that attempted to influence or interfere with U.S. elections, if such activity meets the requirements" from an executive order that demanded the blocking of property belonging to people engaged in cyber activities. "ODNI will lead this effort with participation from CIA, FBI, NSA, and DHS," the record states. Later, Obama officials "leaked false statements to media outlets" claiming that "Russia has attempted through cyber means to interfere in, if not actively influence, the outcome of an election." Former National Security Advisor Susan Rice speaks at the J Street National Conference in Washington in April 2018. Intelligence officials told Fox News Digital that the ICA was "politicized" because it "suppressed intelligence from before and after the election showing Russia lacked intent and capability to hack the 2016 election." Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe testifies during a congressional hearing in Washington. The official also said the ICA had assessed that "Russia was responsible for leaking data from the DNC and DCCC," while "failing to mention that FBI and NSA previously expressed low confidence in this attribution." Officials said the intelligence was "politicized" and then "used as the basis for countless smears seeking to delegitimize President Trump's victory, the years-long Mueller investigation, two Congressional impeachments, high level officials being investigated, arrested, and thrown in jail, heightened US-Russia tensions, and more." A report prepared by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in 2020 said the intelligence community did not have any direct information that Russian President Vladimir Putin wanted to help elect Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election, but, at the "unusual" direction of then-President Barack Obama, published "potentially biased" or "implausible" intelligence suggesting otherwise. The report, based on an investigation launched by former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., was dated Sept. 18, 2020. Fox News Digital obtained the "fully-sourced limited-access investigation report that was drafted and stored in a limited-access vault at CIA Headquarters." According to the report, the ICA was a "high-profile product ordered by the President, directed by senior IC agency heads, and created by just five CIA analysts, using one principal drafter." President Obama nominates John Brennan as CIA director during a ceremony at the White House Jan. 7, 2013. "The draft was not properly coordinated within CIA or the IC, ensuring it would be published without significant challenges to its conclusions." The report states that Brennan "ordered the post-election publication of 15 reports containing previously collected but unpublished intelligence, three of which were substandard — containing information that was unclear, of uncertain origin, potentially biased, or implausible — and those became foundational sources for the ICA judgements that Putin preferred Trump over Clinton." Russian President Vladimir Putin chairs a government meeting at his Novo-Ogaryovo residence Aug. 7, 2024. "One scant, unclear, and unverifiable fragment of a sentence from one of the substandard reports constitutes the only classified information cited to suggest Putin ‘aspired' to help Trump win," the report states, adding that the ICA "ignored or selectively quoted reliable intelligence reports that challenged — and in some cases undermined — judgments that Putin sought to elect Trump." The report also states that the ICA "failed to consider plausible alternative explanations of Putin's intentions indicated by reliable intelligence and observed Russian actions." The report also includes intelligence from a longtime Putin confidant who explained to investigators that "Putin told him he did not care who won the election," and that Putin "had often outlined the weaknesses of both major candidates." The committee also found that the ICA suppressed intelligence that showed that Russia was actually planning for a Hillary Clinton victory because "they knew where (she) stood" and believed Russia "could work with her." The committee also found that the ICA suppressed intelligence showing that Putin was "not only demonstrating a clear lack of concern for Trump's election fate," but also indicated "that he preferred to see Secretary Clinton elected, knowing she would be a more vulnerable President." One section of the declassified House Intelligence Committee report states that the material in Putin's possession included Russian intelligence on Democratic National Committee information allegedly showing that senior Democratic leaders found Clinton's health to be "extraordinarily alarming." "As of September 2016, the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service had DNC information that President Obama and Party leaders found the state of Secretary Clinton's health to be ‘extraordinarily alarming,' and felt it could have ‘serious negative impact' on her election prospects," the report states. "Her health information was being kept in ‘strictest secrecy' and even close advisors were not being fully informed." The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service also allegedly had DNC communications that showed that "Clinton was suffering from ‘intensified psycho-emotional problems, including uncontrolled fits of anger, aggression, and cheerfulness.'" Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine ,appear onstage with their families at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia July 28, 2016. "Clinton was placed on a daily regimen of ‘heavy tranquilizers' and while afraid of losing, she remained ‘obsessed with a thirst for power,'" the report states. The Russians also allegedly had information that Clinton "suffered from ‘Type 2 diabetes, Ischemic heart disease, deep vein thrombosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.'" The Russians also allegedly possessed a "campaign email discussing a plan approved by Secretary Clinton to link Putin and Russian hackers to candidate Trump in order to ‘distract the American public' from the Clinton email server scandal." Gabbard, during the White House press briefing Wednesday, said there were "high-level DNC emails that detailed evidence of Hillary's, quote, psycho-emotional problems, uncontrolled fits of anger, aggression and cheerfulness, and that then-Secretary Clinton was allegedly on a daily regimen of heavy tranquilizers." Tranquilizers are typically prescribed to individuals suffering from anxiety, sleep disturbances and related conditions affecting their mental and physical health. A Clinton aide dismissed the claims as "ridiculous." Neither Clinton nor Obama responded to Fox News Digital's requests for comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chinese financiers and operators are behind a surge of illegal marijuana grow operations that have sprung up across Maine, according to Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME). Collins has led the charge to stand up a joint federal, state, and local operation to take down the hundreds of confirmed grow houses in her backyard. Since 2022, her small New England home state has had 270 confirmed illegal marijuana grow operations uncovered by authorities, but Collins is particularly concerned with who is behind them. Collins has finally started to see meaningful progress made in the months since President Donald Trump took office, but getting here has been a yearslong effort that Collins and others involved shared the details of. Until recently, rural Central Maine was a hub for the grow houses, and Maine itself was a national leader for states affected by this type of crime. Unlike in other leading states for illegal marijuana grow operations, such as California and Oklahoma, where Latin criminal organizations known as cartels were behind the operations, that was not the case in Maine. Trouble first appeared on Collins's radar in June 2022, when she was contacted by a constituent about suspicious activity at a nearby home. Collins began working with the DEA around that time to get federal law enforcement involved. Local authorities began sharing their observations: homes with electric bills higher than a motel's, unusual smells around certain houses, lots of Chinese people coming and going all at once every few weeks in a predominantly white area, according to Richard LaBelle, town manager for Norridgewock, Maine's 3,300 residents. Some of them they had mortgages on, and they were coming in and not seeking any permits or anything like that. “You were seeing commercial electricity drops brought into the homes. They were covering windows, doors, and walls with insulation,” LaBelle said. Maine is one of the few states that allows residents to grow marijuana legally. Residents over 21 may grow up to six mature plants, but anyone who grows it for medical use is exempt from those caps. It also gave illegal growers some cover since, from an outsider's perspective, the grow could be for medical purposes. But this was different and not for medical reasons, according to Paul Spera, special agent in charge at the DEA. “Maine marijuana goes to Massachusetts and New York — lots of different organizations. Some of it stays in Maine, being sold to undercut the legitimate market. It destroyed the homes past repair from future habitation and took what was once a perfectly good home off the real estate market, particularly at a time when Maine has an affordable housing shortage, Collins said. “I personally think Maine made a mistake in legalizing cannabis, but at least it did so with a regulatory framework that is intended to regulate the amount of THC, the amount of pesticides, the type of herbicides … those regulations, obviously, are not followed at all by these illegal grow houses,” Collins said. In August 2023, Collins and other Maine lawmakers took action and sent then-U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland a letter calling on the Justice Department to shut down what had been confirmed to be illegally run marijuana grow operations. Collins wanted federal assistance because local and state law enforcement could not adequately address the problem. Sometimes, the growers declared their status as medical growers to avoid getting into trouble or would shut down operations and take everything out of the house overnight, leaving it beyond repair. The DOJ promised to look into it in April 2024. Collins put Garland on the spot during a public Senate hearing that same month and asked what the Biden administration was doing about it. The DEA has been inside 50 to 100 grow houses in Maine since 2023, according to Spera, and helped local and state police as they responded and began investigations into the bigger picture of what was going on. That also means federal prosecutors and support from the DOJ, which Collins said she was still not seeing. In June 2024, then-FBI Director Christopher Wray confirmed to Collins what she had suspected: “We are starting to see, as we unpack this more, more ties of a lot of these growing operations and Chinese organized crime.” “It was very frustrating to me in the previous administration that I could not secure the kind of help that Maine needed — that Maine sheriffs and local law enforcement needed — to close down what are estimated to be, at that time, some 200 grow houses in my state,” Collins said. Earlier this year, FBI Director Kash Patel and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem both committed to working with Maine to shut down the grow operations. In early July, the DOJ charged seven Chinese nationals in a multi-million dollar conspiracy to cultivate and distribute marijuana across the New England region by using grow houses concealed inside single-family properties in Maine and Massachusetts. A DOJ official added in an email to the Washington Examiner that illegal grow houses now appear to number less than 50 statewide.</p>

SAN DIEGO (AP) — The Grid has overtaken Comic-Con. Disney unveiled details about “Tron: Ares,” which stars Jared Leto, Jeff Bridges and Greta Lee at an evening presentation in Comic-Con's famed Hall H. It will be the third feature film in the “Tron” franchise that kicked off with the hit 1982 film and had a 2010 sequel, “Tron: Legacy.” The other major presentations Friday included updates on the final season of “Outlander” and its prequel series “Outlander: Blood of My Blood,” “Alien: Earth” and “Predator: Badlands.” An estimated 135,000 people from around the globe are expected to attend Comic-Con 2025, which runs through Sunday in downtown San Diego. Fans on opening day got a preview of “Five Nights at Freddy's 2,” “The Toxic Avenger,” and a joke-filled session with comedians Gabriel “Fluffy” Iglesias and Jo Koy. Director Dan Trachtenberg brought new footage from “Predator: Badlands” to Comic-Con's Hall H, showing off an unfinished cut of the movie's first 15 minutes and bringing the film's stars. The massive convention hall erupted in cheers at clip, which featured a family of Predators fighting. Trachtenberg said one inspiration behind the movie was the realization that “The Predator never wins.” He wanted to see what that would look like but didn't want to make a slasher film, he said. Elle Fanning, who plays a cyborg who spends much of the film strapped to the young Predator's back, said her first foray into sci-fi presented many new acting challenges. While that was physically challenging, she said, at least she wasn't acting across from a tennis ball, which is often used to give actors a sense of the scale of computer-generated characters. Moderator Kevin Smith (yes, the “Clerks' director) likened it to “essentially Australia in space.” Trachtenberg also showed a clip that will be added to the animated “Killer of Killers” movie, which will become a new end credits scene. It won't be long before audiences get to see the Xenomorph in “Alien: Earth.” But there are some new alien life forms creator Noah Hawley will introduce in the upcoming FX series. Hawley and the cast screened the first episode for a packed Hall H at Comic-Con to cheers and a few scared noises when a new creepy-crawly alien creature claimed its first victim. One of the things he's good at is “understanding what the original movie made me feel and why and trying to create it anew,” he said. The show stars Sydney Chandler as a new life-form created when the consciousness of a young girl is transferred into an adult body with superhuman strength and speed. Asked how she reacted to seeing the Xenomorph on set for the first time, Chandler said, “I almost peed. Set in 2120, it unspools two years before the events of “Alien.” The early moments establish the world as a place controlled by massive corporations and where humans, cyborgs and synthetic humans coexist. Babou Ceesay plays a cyborg whose mission is to protect the alien species at all costs. Humanlike, he has an arm that was likened Friday to a Swiss Army knife. But Ceesay said his character has been away from Earth for more than 60 years and isn't as advanced as he seems: “He's coming back to a planet where he's essentially an iPhone 1 in an iPhone 20 world.” Hawley didn't spill any news about reboots. Trachtenberg, who Smith described as the keeper of the Predator franchise now, had a simple answer: “Wouldn't it be cool?”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fleeing Washington's oppressive humidity and nonstop questions over heated controversies, President Donald Trump is once again taking weekend refuge at his golf clubs — this time more than 3,000 miles away in Scotland. While the White House has called his five-day trip a “working visit,” it's fairly light on the formal itinerary. Trump is poised to hold trade talks Sunday with the chief of the European Union and is scheduled to meet with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Monday. But he's expected to spend most of his trip out of public view at two of his golf resorts – Trump Turnberry in the west and Trump International about 200 miles away in the north, near his mother's ancestral homeland. “We have a lot of things in Scotland,” Trump said as he left the White House on Friday, noting his familial ties to the land. Even as protesters demonstrated against Trump here on Saturday, the four nights in temperate Scotland come as a summertime respite after six months back in office. Nearly every time Trump has spoken with reporters in recent weeks, he's been pressed with new questions about the Epstein scandal, many of which are fueled by deep suspicions that he and his followers have been stirring for years. The Scotland trip schedule allows Trump to focus instead on areas where he's more comfortable: trade deals, his family businesses and golf. Trump often speaks fondly of his ties to Scotland, the birthplace of his late mother, though the feeling has been far from mutual — his development of luxury golf resorts over the last two decades has ignited objections from many local residents. “What he did in the many estates in Aberdeenshire, and how he bullied and intimidated the local people there, he's not a nice person,” said Fiona McPherson, who joined a demonstration Saturday. She left for New York in 1930 at the age of 18, emigrating to the United States following World War I. Authorities in Scotland have spent weeks preparing for Trump's arrival. The overall tone toward Trump has been markedly less fond, however. The Friday edition of The National, a liberal-leaning newspaper that supports Scottish independence, rolled out a not-so-welcoming message to Trump with a blaring and bold front-page headline: “Convicted US Felon to Arrive in Scotland.” A group called Stop Trump Scotland, a coalition of demonstrators, organized protests at Aberdeen and outside the US consulate in Edinburgh as part of a “Festival of Resistance.” A few hundred people turned out Saturday to raise their voices against the visiting American president, waving colorful signs and chanting slogans. As he arrived in Scotland on Friday night, Trump made no mention of the disapproval awaiting him. He said he eagerly anticipated meeting left-leaning Scottish First Minister John Swinney, who has been an outspoken critic and last year endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. With trade talks intensifying, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen announced Friday that she planned to meet with Trump in Scotland on Sunday “to discuss transatlantic trade relations and how we can keep them strong.” Trump said earlier there was a “50-50” chance he would reach a trade deal with the EU, adding as he departed for Scotland that his administration was “working very diligently” with Europe. Trump's meeting with von der Leyen — whom he has not yet hosted at the White House — comes as the EU rushes to clinch a trade deal with its largest trading partner that would stave off a threatened 30% tariff set to take effect August 1. He has maintained a somewhat distant relationship with von der Leyen, who was close to former President Joe Biden, adding another complexity to their Sunday meeting. “That would be, actually, the biggest deal of them all if we make it,” Trump said of a potential agreement with the European Union after he landed in Scotland Friday. But returning this weekend as the sitting American president has roused critics, including Green Party leader and member of parliament, Patrick Harvie. “Donald Trump is a convicted criminal and political extremist,” Harvie told reporters in Scotland this week. While golf is the primary item on Trump's weekend schedule, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt described the trip as “a working visit that will include a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Starmer to refine the historic US-UK trade deal.” Starmer has worked to develop a warm relationship with Trump, visiting him at the White House in February and holding conversations since then on trade, military support for Ukraine and other global challenges. It's paid off, at least somewhat — Starmer is one of a handful of country leaders who have secured a trade deal with Trump. The deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, officials said, is expected to be among the topics discussed, but British officials have generally been working to lower expectations for the Monday meeting, suggesting it is a prelude to an official state visit in September. Trump is set to return to the United Kingdom at the invitation of King Charles III for a ceremonial welcome at Windsor Castle. He was hosted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2019 at Buckingham Palace. “This is really special,” Starmer said in February when he extended the invitation to Trump in a letter from the King. “President Trump's affinity for Scotland is real, regardless of what people think of his politics,” Anas Sarwar, the Labour Party leader in Scotland wrote in an April essay in The Times of London. For a president who repeatedly railed against his predecessors for golfing – and called last week on the Republican Senate to cancel its annual August recess and “long weekends” to keep working on his agenda – Trump hits the links without apology, no matter the season. On this trip, Trump is scheduled to spend three nights at Trump Turnberry, a luxury resort that he has owned since 2014 on the west coast, overlooking the Irish Sea. He will also spend one night at his course in Aberdeenshire, on the northern coast, and take part in the only public event expected on his itinerary: a dedication ceremony for a second 18-hole course. It was last held at Trump's course on the Scottish west coast in 2009, five years before Trump purchased the resort. “I think they will do that,” Trump said Friday. Politics is also at play, which was underscored by a full-page advertisement in the National newspaper on Friday that urged the public to sign a petition against it. Don't give The Open to Trump Turnberry.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge denied on Friday the Trump administration's attempts to make Chicago shed its “sanctuary city” status and assist the federal government's immigration efforts. Illinois passed a law in 2021 prohibiting local or state officials from sharing a person's custody status, release date, or contact information with federal immigration officials. Chicago, New York City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco are among the “sanctuary” cities. The Trump administration has targeted cities for their sanctuary policies, hoping to force them to relent and assist with their mass deportation effort. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced on Thursday that the Department of Justice would sue New York City Mayor Eric Adams over the city's sanctuary policies after an off-duty Border Patrol officer was shot during an attempted robbery. “The Department of Justice is suing New York City and Mayor Eric Adams for continuing to obstruct law enforcement with sanctuary city policies. If New York's leaders won't step up to protect their citizens, we will,” she wrote in a post on X. JB Pritzker (D-IL) in their case against Illinois, but the judge dismissed him as she found no legal basis for his inclusion. Pritzker has been antagonistic to the Trump administration's immigration efforts. “When you're attacking the people who live here — many people who have been here for decades, paying taxes, law-abiding, raising their children, good members of their community — when you're attacking those people in my state, I don't want you here,” he added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When British traders landed on India's shores in the 1600s, they arrived in search of spices and silk but stayed for centuries – leaving behind a legacy that would shape the nation long after their colonial exploitation ended: the English language. Now, after more than a decade of Hindu-nationalist rule, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is mounting perhaps the most significant challenge yet to the language's place in India. “Those who speak English will soon feel ashamed,” Home Minister Amit Shah said last month, igniting a heated debate about national identity and social mobility in the polyglot nation of 1.4 billion. While Shah did not mention India's former colonial masters, he declared that “the languages of our country are the jewels of our culture” – and that without them, “we cease to be truly Indian.” Spoken behind the walls of colonial forts and offices, English in India was at first the language of ledgers and treaties. With hundreds of languages and dialects spoken across its vast landscape, its newly appointed leaders grappled with the question of which one should represent the new nation. But strong resistance from non-Hindi-speaking regions – especially in the south – meant English would remain only as a temporary link to unite the country. It's a legacy that endures to this day – and still rankles some. But critics argue that Shah's remarks risk undermining the country's global competitiveness. Equating English with cultural shame, they contend, reflects a narrow perspective that needlessly tries to erase a remnant of the colonial era that keeps India fluent in the language of global commerce. “I don't think it's the legacy of colonialism anymore.” And pushback to the BJP's recent messaging has been strong. English is not shame, it's strength,” wrote leader of the opposition Rahul Gandhi on X, after Shah's remarks last month. “Every Indian language has a soul, culture, and knowledge. We must cherish them – and at the same time, teach every child English.” But language tensions are no longer confined to debates in parliament – they're spilling into the streets. Since India's independence from Britain in 1947, the status of English in India has been deeply political – entwined with questions of identity, power, and national direction. But in recent years, Modi's BJP has placed particular emphasis on promoting Hindi and reducing the use of English in public life. The prime minister almost never delivers speeches in English, preferring Hindi for national addresses such as his monthly radio program. His administration has encouraged officials to use Hindi on social media and in government correspondence – though, after criticism from non-Hindi-speaking states, clarified that this was intended mainly for the Hindi belt in the north. Modi's critics have been quick to note his political motives behind these moves. With its roots in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing organization that advocates Hindu hegemony within India, the BJP's language policies resonate with many in a country where nearly 80% of people are Hindu. Analysts say the BJP is seeking to capitalize on this demographic by promoting language policies that strengthen its support base in the north. According to Rita Kothari, an English professor from Ashoka University, the government “is certainly interested in homogenizing the country and making Hindi more widespread.” But that policy can also backfire – in part because many regions, such as Marathi-speaking Maharashtra in the west – are staunchly proud of their local language. For 19-year-old Steve E. Selvaraj from Tamil Nadu's capital Chennai, “the BJP did a great job turning Hindi as their identity.” The college student, whose mother tongue is Tamil, said Hinduism has become a central focus for the ruling establishment – a way to “get more votes.” Kothari, from Ashoka University, said going after English was a convenient way of the BJP promoting Hindi without ruffling regional feathers. The government “knows that its chances of success in south India for instance are thwarted by linguistic pride and nationalism,” she said. “Since they can't make this public, English becomes a whipping boy.” The policy fostered a privileged English-educated elite – lawyers, teachers and writers – including many of India's early reformer nationalists, first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi. As India's economy transformed and its middle class expanded, English proficiency became crucial to upward mobility. For Shivam Singh, 23, the first in his family to speak English and to leave home for university, the language opened doors. “I wanted to get a good job… English gives you an edge. Singh practiced his spoken English on an AI app for hours, getting feedback that helped earn him the internships. India is now home to one of the world's largest English-speaking populations, with more than 130 million people reporting English proficiency in the 2011 census. This linguistic advantage has helped attract billions in foreign investment, enabled global partnerships, and powered sectors from tech support to startups. Yet, the prominence of English has also deepened social divides. Those without language skills find themselves largely excluded from lucrative careers. Wealthier, urban, or higher-caste families are far more likely to be fluent in English and English-medium schools are mainly concentrated in urban areas, leaving rural and lower-caste communities locked out. She added: “If you know Hindi, then all you can do is stay here and do odd jobs, but not get a good post, because English is a requirement.” “Many languages in India do not get the respect or place they deserve,” said Aloka Kujur, a writer and activist from Jharkhand, whose mother tongue is Kuduk, a tribal language native to the east Indian state. “There is no fear of sidelining English,” Kothari, from Ashoka University, said. It's a sentiment Singh, the first student, agrees with.</p>
