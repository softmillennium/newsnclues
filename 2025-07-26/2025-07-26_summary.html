“Exploiting the seabed is not a necessity — it is a choice,” said Palau's president. “And it is reckless.”

Despite growing momentum, world governments failed to agree to a moratorium on deep-sea mining as the 30th session of the International Seabed Authority wrapped up on Friday.

The authority's July meeting was the first since U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to expedite permits for deep-sea mining under U.S. authority and The Metals Company (TMC) promptly applied for U.S. permits. Governments rebuked the U.S. and TMC for their unilateral approach and did not agree on a mining code that would allow the controversial practice to move forward under international law. However, campaigners said more decisive action is needed to protect the ocean and its biodiversity.

“Governments have yet to rise to the moment,” Greenpeace International campaigner Louisa Casson said in a statement. “They remain disconnected from global concerns and the pressing need for courageous leadership to protect the deep ocean.”

Casson continued: “We call on the international community to rise up and defend multilateralism against rogue actors like The Metals Company. Governments must respond by establishing a moratorium and reaffirming that authority over the international seabed lies collectively with all states — for the benefit of humanity as a whole.”

The International Seabed Authority (ISA) gains its authority to regulate deep-sea mining under the United Nations Law of the Sea, to which the U.S. is not party. TMC, however, could suffer consequences for bypassing the international process, as other countries and companies may decide not to do business with it.

At the most recent session, the ISA's council decided not to revoke exploratory permits it had previously granted to TMC and its subsidiaries. However, it approved an investigation on Monday into whether mining contractors such as TMC subsidiaries Nauru Ocean Resources Inc. and Tonga Offshore Mining Limited were abiding by their obligations under international law.

“TMC has been testing the limits of what it can get away with, a bit like a child seeing how far it can go with bad behavior,” Matthew Gianni, cofounder of the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition (DSCC), told The New York Times.

“The member countries of the ISA have basically sent a shot across the bow, a warning to TMC that going rogue may well result in the loss of its ISA exploration claims,” Gianna explained, adding that the investigation also served as a warning to other companies who might consider following TMC's example.

Casson agreed: “The international community's message to The Metals Company is clear: Violating international law, ignoring scientific consensus, and disregarding human rights will have consequences. This is also a warning to any companies or governments choosing to align themselves with [TMC CEO] Gerard Barron's business model — they must be prepared to bear the reputational fallout of trying to destroy the ocean.”

At the same time, a U.S. representative spoke on Thursday, doubling down on Trump's dismissal of the international process and earning instant push back from Brazil, France, and China

“As a non-party to the Law of the Sea Convention, the United States is not bound by the convention rules dealing with seabed mining through the International Seabed Authority,” the U.S. statement said in part.

The statement came days after Greenpeace released a report titled Deep Deception: How the Deep-Sea Mining Industry is Manipulating Geopolitics to Profit from Ocean Destruction, which details how TMC and other deep-sea mining companies are exploiting national security concerns to lobby U.S. lawmakers to fast track deep-sea mining.

“The U.S. statement confirms what Deep Deception has already exposed: The Trump administration's pursuit of deep-sea mining isn't about global stewardship — it's about sidestepping it,” Arlo Hemphill, Greenpeace USA's project lead for the Stop Deep-Sea Mining campaign, said in a statement. “By rejecting the ISA's authority while claiming environmental responsibility, the U.S. is trying to have it both ways — and in doing so is advancing a ‘smash and grab' agenda that puts ocean health and international cooperation at serious risk.”

Ultimately, ocean advocates agree that the only way to protect the deep sea is for governments to agree to a precautionary pause on a practice they argue would do irreparable harm to ecosystems science barely understands.

The consensus for such a pause is building, with Croatia becoming the 38th nation to support one during the latest ISA meeting.

“The ISA is paralyzed by a small group clinging to outdated extraction agendas while blocking even the most basic reforms,” Simon Holmström, the deep-sea mining policy officer for Seas at Risk, said in a statement. “The firm rejection of the U.S. and The Metals Company's power grab, alongside 38 countries now calling for a moratorium or precautionary pause, shows growing resistance to sacrificing the planet's least understood ecosystem for corporate short-term profit.”

Several nations spoke strongly in favor a moratorium, including Palau, Panama, and France.

“Exploiting the seabed is not a necessity — it is a choice,” said His Excellency Surangel S. Whipps Jr., president of the Republic of Palau, on Tuesday. “And it is reckless. It is gambling with the future of Pacific Island children, who will inherit the dire consequences of decisions made far from their shores.”

A Pacific leader from Solomon Island also defended the interests of the Pacific Ocean community: “As Pacific people, we continue to carry the trauma of what extractive industries have already done to our homes. Mining companies that came with promises, stripped our lands and waters, and left behind ecological, cultural, and spiritual scars. We cannot let that cycle repeat itself, in the ocean that connects us. That sustains us. And that defines us.”

Olivier Poivre d'Arvor of France called for a pause of 10-15 years: “Our message is clear: no deep-sea mining without science, without collective legitimacy, without equity […] France is calling for a moratorium or a precautionary pause. What for? Because we refuse to mortgage the future for a few nodules extracted in a hurry, in favor of a few.”

However, campaigners argued that many governments continued to fall short of the commitments they had made at the U.N. Ocean Conference (UNOC) in Nice in early June.

“Thirty-eight states have now joined the call for a moratorium or precautionary pause, with Croatia joining the coalition during this Assembly,” said DSCC campaign director Sofia Tsenikli. “But too many other states, which were bold in their ocean promises at UNOC, are not putting this into action at the ISA. Governments must meet their promises by doing what it takes to implement a moratorium before it's too late.”

Farah Obaidullah, founder and director of The Ocean and Us, argued that the ocean already faces too many other threats to add the additional burden of deep-sea mining.

“The health of the high seas including the seabed is critical to our own. Yet our shared heritage faces an onslaught of threats from climate and nature collapse, escalating tensions, and failed leadership,” Obaidullah said. “To even consider a new form of ecocide on our already ailing planet is both reckless and irrational. We know that deep-sea mining will devastate life in the deep ocean, wipe out species before they have been discovered, and impact ocean functions, including carbon sequestration. When it comes to the ocean we have no time to lose. We cannot colonize and conquer our shared heritage which belongs to us all. There is only one responsible way forward, and that is to secure a moratorium on deep-sea mining.”

DSCC's Gianni also argued strongly for a pause: “Being on the fence or remaining silent is not a politically defensible position. We are risking severe ecological damage, and future generations will ask what we did to stop it. There is still a chance to stop this industry before it begins, but only if governments stand up for science, equity, and precaution now, and take action to prevent companies within their jurisdiction from cooperating with rogue mining operations.”

Greenpeace's Hemphill concluded: “Governments must secure a moratorium that leaves no room for a desperate industry to force through a mining code. The science is not ready. The legal framework is not in place. The world must not be bullied into an irreversible mistake for the benefit of a few.”

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

Animosity between former friends and political patriarchs Hun Sen and Thaksin Shinawatra is exacerbating clashes

The dispute over Thailand and Cambodia's contested border, which dates back more than a century to disagreements over colonial-era maps, has broken into conflict before. But the most recent clashes, which erupted on Thursday, have been fuelled by another factor: a bitter feud between two powerful political patriarchs.

Hun Sen, 72, and Thaksin Shinawatra, 76, former leaders of Cambodia and Thailand, were once such close friends they reportedly called one another brothers. Hun Sen has, over the years, supported Thaksin's family during their long-running power struggle with Thailand's military. Thaksin and his sister Yingluck stayed at Hun Sen's home after they were ousted from power, while Hun Sen appointed Thaksin an economic adviser to the Cambodian government. Thaksin frequently visited Cambodia, and Hun Sen was the first foreign guest to see the former Thai leader after he returned home after more than 15 years in self-imposed exile.

But relations have broken down spectacularly over recent months. The exact reasons for their feud are unclear, but analysts say it has created an additional layer of volatility that is exacerbating deadly clashes on the neighbouring countries' border.

Hun Sen and Thaksin are no longer in office in their respective countries, but both remain powerful. Hun Sen ruled for almost 40 years until 2003, when his eldest son Hun Manet became prime minister after running virtually uncontested in a sham election. Thaksin's daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra became prime minister last year.

The extent of their falling out became clear last month, when Hun Sen leaked a recording of a phone conversation between himself and Paetongtarn.
  In the call, which was about the border dispute, Paetongtarn called Hun Sen “uncle” and told him if there was anything he wanted, she would “take care of it”. She also made disparaging comments about a senior Thai military commander.

The leaked recording caused uproar in Thailand. Critics accused her of kowtowing to Cambodia, putting her family connections before the country's national interests. She was suspended from office by the constitutional court in July pending an investigation into ethical violations.

It's not clear why Hun Sen chose to turn on his former friends. He has accused Thaksin of betrayal and threatened to reveal further sensitive information about the Shinawatras. “I never imagined someone so close could act this way,” Thaksin said later, declaring their friendship over.

Some analysts say Hun Sen may be trying to whip up nationalism domestically to increase support for his son, Hun Manet.

Others suggest Hun Sen has been angered by Thailand's efforts to crack down on so-called “scam compounds” where trafficked workers are held and forced to target people around the world with online scams. This form of lucrative criminal activity has proliferated in the region over recent years, especially in Cambodia.

“The popular narrative in Thailand is that the two men may have had some kind of personal dealings behind the scenes that did not go according to plan and the fallout has spilled over into the realm of national interest,” said Tita Sanglee, associate fellow with ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.

Whatever his motivations, Hun Sen has succeeded in damaging Thaksin's position, exploiting divisions between his family and the military, and creating a power vacuum in Thailand.

Hun Sen, meanwhile, “holds near absolute control in Cambodia”, adds Tita. He has stamped out virtually all opposition voices and independent media. “When he chooses to take a strong stance, militarily or politically, it has immediate and direct consequences.”

On Thursday night, Thaksin said he had thanked countries that had offered to mediate the border dispute, but would like to wait, adding: “We need to let the Thai military do their job, and first teach this cunning Hun Sen a lesson.”

Given Thaksin's weakened position, he may not have a choice but to let the military take the lead.

Last week Thailand downgraded it diplomatic relations with Cambodia, recalling its ambassador, and saying it would expel the country's envoy in Bangkok.

Thaksin has denied the families' feud was the cause of the clashes. However awkward questions about his friend turned foe are likely to continue.

As he visited communities sheltering from the conflict in Ubon Ratchathani, in northeastern Thailand, a woman confronted him: “You're Hun Sen's friend, aren't you? Is he your friend? Why do you allow Cambodia to shoot Thai people?”
 Solving territorial disagreements is difficult in any context, said Pavin Chachavalpongpun, professor at the Center for Southeast Asian Studies at Kyoto University. “No country would like to sacrifice any inch of sovereignty,” he said. But the personal conflict between Hun Sen and Thaksin has, he added, made their countries' dispute even more unpredictable.

            The leaders of Cambodia and Thailand have agreed to meet for ceasefire talks after days of cross-border violence, according to statements on Saturday from both sides as well as US President Donald Trump.
    


            Trump said earlier in the weekend that he had spoken with both Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and acting prime minister of Thailand Phumtham Wechayachai in his efforts to restore peace.
    


Thai-Cambodian conflict pits a well-equipped US ally against a weaker adversary with strong China links



            “They have agreed to immediately meet and quickly work out a Ceasefire and, ultimately, PEACE!” Trump wrote on Truth Social in a series of posts on outlining his diplomatic efforts on Saturday.
    


            Trump said he had warned Hun Manet and Phumtham that he would not make trade deals with either country if the deadly border conflict continued.
    


            “They are also looking to get back to the “Trading Table” with the United States, which we think is inappropriate to do until such time as the fighting STOPS,” Trump wrote.
    


            Earlier this month, Trump wrote letters to Thailand and Cambodia threatening a 36% tariff on most of their exports to the US, starting August 1. Cambodia and Thailand both delivered substantial offers to their US counterparts in an effort to move to the front of the line for a trade agreement, officials said at the time.
    


            In the early hours of Sunday morning local time, Hun Manet thanked Trump and said that Cambodia agreed with “the proposal for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire between the two armed forces.” It added that he had previously called for a ceasefire to ASEAN chair and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
    


            A statement from Thailand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs was more measured, saying it wished to see “sincere intention from the Cambodian side” – but that Phumtham had also “requested President Trump to convey …that Thailand wants to convene a bilateral dialogue as soon as possible to bring forth measures and procedures for the ceasefire and the eventual peaceful resolution of the conflict.”
    


            Bangkok and Phnom Penh have been fighting over territory disputed since colonial power France drew the border between them more than a century ago. The renewed deadly conflict pits longtime US ally Thailand, with decades of experience, against Cambodia's relatively young armed force with close ties to China.
    


            Since fighting broke out on Thursday, more than a dozen people have been reported killed, dozens wounded, and more than 150,000 civilians evacuated. Clashes have continued into Saturday, according to officials on both sides.
    


            The United Nations has condemned the violence, with Secretary General António Guterres offering his assistance “in any efforts towards a peaceful resolution of the dispute” in a statement released Saturday by his spokesperson.

            The leaders of Cambodia and Thailand have agreed to meet to negotiate a ceasefire, according to a social media post by United States President Donald Trump on Saturday.
    


            Trump, who said he held separate calls with the Prime Minister of Cambodia and acting Prime Minister of Thailand, claimed that both countries, “have agreed to immediately meet and quickly work out a Ceasefire and, ultimately, PEACE!”
    


            The news came shortly after Trump called publicly on both parties to negotiate peace amid escalating violence on the disputed border between Thailand and Cambodia.
    


            Bangkok and Phnom Penh have been fighting over territory disputed since colonial power France drew the border between them more than a century ago. The renewed deadly conflict pits longtime US ally Thailand, with decades of experience, against Cambodia's relatively young armed force with close ties to China.
    


            Since fighting broke out on Thursday, more than a dozen people have been reported killed, dozens wounded, and more than 150,000 civilians evacuated. Clashes have continued into Saturday, according to officials on both sides.
    


            Here's a look at the histories and capabilities of the two sides.
    


            Thailand's military dwarfs that of neighboring Cambodia, both in personnel and weaponry.
    


            Thailand's total of 361,000 active-duty personnel spread across all branches of the kingdom's military is three times Cambodia's. And those troops have at their disposal weaponry their Cambodian counterparts could only dream of.
    


            “Thailand has a large, well-funded military and its air force is one of the best equipped and trained in Southeast Asia,” the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) wrote in its “Military Balance 2025” look at the world's armed forces.
    


            Meanwhile, a 2024 ranking of the military capabilities of 27 regional nations by the Lowy Institute places Thailand at 14th, to Cambodia's 23rd.
    


            Such a disparity is perhaps to be expected, given Thailand has four times as many people as Cambodia, and a GDP more than 10 times larger. Unlike Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, it escaped the ravages of the wars that engulfed the region in the second half of the 20th century, and the European colonialism that preceded them.
    


            Overall, with factors including military, economic, diplomatic and cultural power weighed in the Lowy Asia Power Index, Thailand is ranked 10th, considered a middle power, just behind Indonesia but ahead of countries including Malaysia and Vietnam.
    


            Lowy ranks Cambodia as a minor power in Asia, grouped with countries such as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Laos.
    


            In an earlier Truth Social post on Saturday, Trump said he has spoken to the acting prime minister of Thailand, Phumtham Wechayachai.
    


            “I have just spoken to the Acting Prime Minister of Thailand, and it was a very good conversation,” he wrote. “Thailand, like Cambodia, wants to have an immediate Ceasefire, and PEACE. I am now going to relay that message back to the Prime Minister of Cambodia. After speaking to both Parties, Ceasefire, Peace, and Prosperity seems to be a natural. We will soon see!”
    


            Thailand's military has long been a major player in the kingdom's politics. The country has for years been dominated by a conservative establishment comprising the military, the monarchy and influential elites.
    


            Generals have seized power in 20 coups since 1932, often toppling democratic governments, according to the CIA World Factbook, and the military portrays itself as the ultimate defender of the monarchy.
    


            Thailand is a United States treaty ally, a status dating back to the signing of the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty, also known as the Manila Pact, in 1954, according to the US State Department.
    


            During the Vietnam War, Thailand hosted US Air Force assets at some air bases, including B-52 bombers, and tens of thousands Thai troops fought on the side of the US-backed South Vietnam against the communist North.
    


            Strong ties between Washington and Bangkok have endured. Thailand is classed as a major non-NATO ally by the US, giving it special benefits that have enabled it to enjoy access to decades of US support for its weapons programs.
    


            Thailand and the US Indo-Pacific Command co-host the annual Cobra Gold military exercise, which began in 1982 as joint drills with the US but has since added dozens of other participants. It's the longest-running international military exercise in the world, according to the US military.
    


            Besides Cobra Gold, Thai and US forces hold more than 60 exercises together, and more than 900 US aircraft and 40 Navy ships visit Thailand yearly, the US State Department says.
    


            Despite all that history with Washington, these days the Thai military tries to maintain a more neutral approach to military policy, increasing ties with China in the past decade.
    


            Not wanting to rely on any one country as its arms supplier, it has also developed a strong domestic weapons industry, with the help of countries such as Israel, Italy, Russia, South Korea and Sweden, the “Military Balance” report says.
    


            Cambodia's military is young in comparison to Thailand's, established in 1993 after forces of the communist government were merged with two non-communist resistance armies, according to the IISS.
    


            “Cambodia's most important international defense links are with China and Vietnam. Despite a traditional reliance on Russia for defense equipment, China has emerged as a key supplier,” the IISS says.
    


            Beijing has even developed a naval base in Cambodia. The Ream Naval Base, on the Gulf of Thailand, would be able to host Chinese aircraft carriers, according to international analysts.
    


            Cambodia and China completed the seventh edition of their annual Golden Dragon joint military exercise in May, which was touted as the largest ever and featured live-fire training scenarios.
    


            It's a relationship that's expected to reach “a new level and achieve new development” this year, according to a February report on the People's Liberation Army's English-language website.

            “China and Cambodia are iron-clad friends who… always support each other. The two militaries enjoy unbreakable relations and rock-solid brotherhood,” Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Senior Col. Wu Qian told a press conference in February, when asked about possible fissures in relations.
    


            Cambodia's military needs the support.
    


            “Cambodia currently lacks the ability to design and manufacture modern equipment for its armed forces,” the IISS report says.
    


            Bolstered by years of US support, the Royal Thai Air Force is well equipped, with at least 11 modern Swedish Gripen fighter jets and dozens of older, US-made F-16 and F-5 jets, according to the IISS. Cambodia has no combat-capable air force to speak of.
    


            On the ground, Thailand has dozens of battle tanks, including 60 modern, Chinese-made VT-4 tanks, and hundreds of older, US-made tanks. Cambodia has about 200 old Chinese- and Soviet-made tanks, the “Military Balance” shows.
    


            The Thai army boasts more than 600 artillery pieces, including at least 56 powerful 155mm weapons and more than 550 105mm towed guns. Cambodia has only a dozen 155mm guns with around 400 smaller towed artillery pieces, according to IISS figures.
    


            In the air, the army has US-made Cobra attack helicopters as well as 18 US Black Hawk transports. Cambodia has only a few dozen older Soviet and Chinese transport helicopters.
    


            Hawaii-based military analyst Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center, said that while Thailand has the numerical and qualitative military advantage, Cambodia has at least one thing in its favor – the actual land along the disputed border.
    


            “Terrain favors access from Cambodian territory to the disputed area,” Schuster told CNN.
    


            And with Cambodian forces allegedly  laying landmines and booby traps in the disputed area, Thailand can be expected to rely on longer-range weaponry, he said.
    


            “The Royal Thai Air Force is superior and their special forces are superior,” Schuster said. “I think the Thais will prefer to emphasize air power and long-range firepower in the conflict.”

When president Donald Trump stepped off Air Force One on to Scottish soil, he had one thing on his mind.

“There's no place like Turnberry,” he told his travelling press pool beneath the wing of his presidential jet. His Ayrshire golf course, he continued, was “the best … probably the best course in the world”.

Minutes later, he climbed into the Beast – his armoured limousine - to travel 35 minutes along country lanes and through Scottish villages, lined with supporters, protesters, and the merely curious, to Turnberry.

Mr Trump may be determined to have a break, but European leaders have other ideas. Willingly or otherwise, Mr Trump faces a string of meetings in the coming days as the Continent's power brokers sit down with the unpredictable president.

For now, though, he is secure inside a ring of steel. The historic course, home to some of the most exciting Opens in history, has been locked down. It now sits inside an eight-foot fence, its fairways dotted with burly men in dark suits and earpieces.

Snipers watch over the course from a watch tower.

Police officers – some on quad bikes – patrol the famous course and the dunes that flank it.

Mr Trump arrived with his golf clubs for four days at his two Scottish courses but without some of the trappings of a travelling American president.

He travelled with a stripped-down retinue of aides. There was no chief of staff, director of communications, secretary of state or other cabinet ministers, who might be expected on an important foreign trip.

His public weekend schedule showed no planned events. Instead, it was a chance to spend time at his golf course with his sons Eric, who manages the family businesses, and Don Jr.

Officials insisted that this was a “working trip” including a meeting with Sir Keir Starmer on Monday, although they were vague on agenda items.

Yet all that changed shortly before Mr Trump flew out of Washington, when Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, announced on X that she would be meeting Mr Trump on Sunday as she closes in on a trade deal:

Following a good call with @POTUS, we have agreed to meet in Scotland on Sunday to discuss transatlantic trade relations, and how we can keep them strong.

EU members have drawn up a retaliatory hit list. The plan is to impose 30pc tariffs on bourbon whisky, yachts, soybeans and other American products if a deal cannot be reached by August 1 to lift US levies.

Mrs von der Leyen had better tread carefully. A diplomat who has prepared ministers for meetings with Mr Trump said she was playing a high-risk game. “Very dangerous,” they said.

Mr Trump's chat with reporters at Glasgow Prestwick Airport showed a president relaxed and looking forward to four days of golf, but one who was quick to bristle when it came to policy and politics.

Mr Trump left Washington bugged by the drip, drip, drip of headlines about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire paedophile who took his own life in a jail cell six years ago.

He flashed irritation and lobbed sharp words at reporters who asked him how much he knew about the case on Friday, but relaxed as soon as he could talk about the love of his life: golf and the course at Turnberry.

“Sean Connery helped get me the permits,” he claimed after landing. “If it weren't for Sean Connery, we wouldn't have those great courses.”

There is a lesson for European leaders looking to muscle in on his tee times with their trade demands or for John Swinney, the Scottish First Minister, who is likely to tell Mr Trump that his tariffs are hurting the Scotch whisky industry.

When the chat with reporters turned from golf to more substantial matters, he said he had a simple message for Europe.

“On immigration, you better get your act together,” he said in another flash of passion. “You're not going to have Europe anymore... This immigration is killing Europe.”

Anyone meeting with Mr Trump will remember the lessons of Volodymyr Zelensky's Oval Office row. The Ukrainian president was roundly chastised by Mr Trump and his vice president for daring to push back on the US position.

And by hosting leaders at his Turnberry and Aberdeenshire courses, Mr Trump retains home advantage even while on foreign soil.

Sir Keir may have got the memo. Mr Trump billed their meeting as little more than a chance to celebrate their recent trade deal.

Although the Prime Minister does run the risk of upsetting Mr Trump over plans to raise the plight of civilians in Gaza, British officials played down the chances of any major diplomatic announcements.

“It's not like other meetings where we would go in with deliverables we planned to announce,” he said.

On Saturday, all that was far from Mr Trump's mind. He spent the day golfing with son Eric, and his ambassador to London.

The sound of Billy Joel's ‘Uptown Girl' and ‘Memories' from the musical Cats drifted out from the dunes on Saturday morning as Mr Trump's motorcade of golf buggies arrived at the fourth hole.

Photographers huddled on a mound in the dunes, hoping to get a shot of the president on the course.

Mr Trump, wearing a white USA cap and dressed in black, waved at the mound before teeing off in the direction of Turnberry lighthouse.

Cheers from his baseball-cap-wearing entourage could be heard above the din of the speakers as the group wasted little time in rattling off their drives.

A photographer camped in the dunes with a long lens later claimed to have witnessed the president cheat on the third fairway.

He said Mr Trump had been handed a ball by a caddy, which he then dropped to the floor and pushed forward a little with an iron before taking a swing.

The golf course has been surrounded by an eight-foot-high metal fence, while dozens of officers patrolled the entrances to the beach from Turnberry all the way down to Maidens, the next town along the coast.

A temporary watchtower had been erected to monitor the Turnberry perimeter with a sniper rifle trained on the course below.

A drone scanned from above, and police boats patrolled the coastal waters.

Asked whether there would be a repeat of protesters taking to the beach in front of the golf club, an officer said the incident in 2018 had likely convinced the authorities to close off the entire beach to the public.

Fears that the visit would be a magnet for protesters appeared unfounded.

Matt Halliday, from Stranraer, said he had been driving around for two hours trying and failing to find protests to join.

He said Mr Trump had “stamped all over Scotland” with his grand golf resort plans, strong-arming local farmers and “bullying” the council over wind farm plans.

One of his signs bore a picture of the president with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.

“I think it is going to bring him down,” he said.

However, supporters were easier to find than protesters.

Two wearing red “Make England Great Again” hats arrived shortly after the president had disappeared over the crest of a dune.

“We love Trump,” said Kay English, 37, wearing a face mask sporting the president's face.

Tom English, a 38-year-old driver, said the pair had driven up from Liverpool last night to catch a glimpse of the president.

“We support Maga, Trump and what he is doing,” he told reporters, adding: “I like the way he is, the way he speaks. It is comedy gold.

“He is putting the people first. He is trying to help the whole world to make peace - he is the president of peace.”

Mr English said he would return on Sunday and hopefully get within “shouting distance” to offer words of encouragement to the president and cheer on his cost-cutting Doge unit.

He added: “We love Doge, we are trying to get that here through Reform. There is so much being wasted.”

Mr Trump has long blurred the line between family, business and public life.

But any world leader intruding on his golfing getaway had better be ready for a possible sharp response.

Venezuelans back home under Maduro-Trump deal tell of isolation, beatings and dirty water – ‘a living nightmare'  

Venezuelans that the Trump administration expelled to El Salvador's most notorious megaprison endured “state-sanctioned torture”, lawyers for some of the men have said, as more stories emerge about the horrors they faced during capacity.

When José Manuel Ramos Bastidas – one of 252 Venezuelan men that the US sent to El Salvador's most notorious mega-prison – finally made it back home to El Tocuyo on Tuesday, the first thing he did was stretch his arms around his family.

His wife, son and mother were wearing the bright blue shirts they had printed with a photo of him, posed in a yellow and black moto jacket and camo-print jeans. It was the first time they had hugged him since he left Venezuela last year. And it was the first time they could be sure – truly sure – that he was alive and well since he disappeared into the Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo (Cecot) in March.

“We have been waiting for this moment for months, and I feel like I can finally breathe,” said Roynerliz Rodríguez, Ramos Bastidas's partner. “These last months have been a living nightmare, not knowing anything about José Manuel and only imagining what he must be suffering. I am happy he is free from Cecot, but I also know that we will never be free of the shadow of this experience. There must be justice for all those who suffered this torture.”

The Venezuelan deportees were repatriated last week following a deal between the US and Venezuelan governments. Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan president, negotiated a prisoner swap that released 10 American citizens in his custody and dozens of Venezuelan political prisoners in exchange for the release of his citizens from Cecot.

This week, after undergoing medical and background checks, they are finally reuniting with their families. Their testimonies of what they experienced inside Cecot are providing the first, most detailed pictures of the conditions inside Cecot, a mega-prison that human rights groups say is designed to disappear people.

Ramos Bastidas and other US deportees were told that they were condemned to spend 30 to 90 years in Cecot unless the US president ordered otherwise, he told his lawyers. They were shot with rubber bullets on repeated occasions – including on Friday, during their last day of detention.

In interviews with the media and in testimony provided to their lawyers, other detainees described lengthy beatings and humiliation by guards. After some detainees tried to break the locks on their cell, prisoners were beaten for six consecutive days, the Atlantic reports. Male guards reportedly brought in female colleagues, who beat the naked prisoners and recorded videos.

Edicson David Quintero Chacón, a US deportee, said that he was placed in isolation for stretches of time, during which he thought he would die, his lawyer told the Guardian. Quintero Chacón, who has scars from daily beatings, also said that he and other inmates were only provided soap and an opportunity to bathe on days when visitors were touring the prison – forcing them to choose between hygiene and public humiliation.

Food was limited, and the drinking water was dirty, Quintero Chacón and other detainees have said. Lights were on all night, so detainees could never fully rest. “And the guards would also come in at night and beat them at night,” said his lawyer Stephanie M Alvarez-Jones, the south-east regional attorney at the National Immigration Project.

In a filing asking for a dismissal of her months-long petition on behalf of her clients' release, Alvarez-Jones wrote: “He will likely carry the psychological impact of this torture his whole life. The courts must never look away when those who wield the power of the US government, at the highest levels, engage in such state-sanctioned violence.”

Ramos Bastidas has never been convicted of any crimes in the US (or in any country). In fact, he had never really set foot in the US as a free man.

In El Tocuyo, in the Venezuelan state of Lara, and had been working since he was a teenager to support his family. Last year, he decided to leave his country – which has yet to recover from an economic collapse – to seek better income, so he could pay for medical care for his infant with severe asthma.

In March 2024, he arrived at the US-Mexico border and presented himself at a port of entry. He made an appointment using the now-defunct CBP One phone application to apply for asylum – but immigration officials and a judge determined that he did not qualify.

But Customs and Border Protection agents had flagged Ramos Bastidas as a possible member of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, based on an unsubstantiated report from Panamanian officials and his tattoos. So they transferred him to a detention facility, where he was to remain until he could be deported.

Despite agreeing to return to Venezuela, he remained for months in detention. “I think what is particularly enraging for José is that he had accepted his deportation,” said Alvarez-Jones. “He was asking for his deportation for a long time, and he just wanted to go back home.”

In December, Venezuela wasn't accepting deportees – so Ramos Bastidas asked if he could be released and make his own way home. A month later, Donald Trump was sworn in as president. Everything changed.

Ramos Bastidas began to see other Venezuelans were being sent to the military base in Guantánamo Bay in Cuba – and he feared the same would happen to him. On 14 March, he shared with his family that maybe he would be able to come back to Venezuela after all, after officials began prepping him for deportation.

The next day, he was flown to Cecot.

“They could have deported him to Venezuela,” Alvarez-Jones. “Instead, the US government made a determination to send him to be tortured in Cecot.”

            A Venezuelan baseball team was denied visas into the United States and will miss this year's Senior Baseball World Series, Little League International confirmed Friday.
    


            The Cacique Mara team, from Maracaibo, Venezuela, was scheduled to participate in the tournament after winning the Latin American championship in Mexico.
    


            “The Cacique Mara Little League team from Venezuela was unfortunately unable to obtain the appropriate visas to travel to the Senior League Baseball World Series,” Little League International said in a statement, adding that it is “extremely disappointing, especially to these young athletes.”
    


            The Venezuelan team traveled to Colombia two weeks ago to apply for their visas at the U.S. embassy in Bogotá.
    


            The embassy did not immediately respond to an Associated Press request for comment.
    


            “It is a mockery on the part of Little League to keep us here in Bogotá with the hope that our children can fulfill their dreams of participating in a world championship,” the team said in a statement. “What do we do with so much injustice, what do we do with the pain that was caused to our children?”
    


            Venezuela is among a list of countries with restrictions for entering the U.S. or its territories. President Donald Trump has banned travel to the U.S. from 12 other countries, citing national security concerns.
    


‘Our fans are feeling in fear': One year out from the World Cup, Mexico supporters are avoiding matches due to ICE concerns



            Earlier in the month, the Cuban women's volleyball team was denied visas to participate in a tournament in Puerto Rico.
    


            “They told us that Venezuela is on a list because Trump says Venezuelans are a threat to the security of his state, of his country,” said Kendrick Gutiérrez, the league's president in Venezuela. “It hasn't been easy the situation; we earned the right to represent Latin America in the World Championship.”
    


            The Senior League Baseball World Series, a tournament for players aged 13-16, is played each year in Easley, South Carolina. It begins Saturday.
    


            The tournament organizers replaced the Venezuelans with the Santa Maria de Aguayo team from Tamaulipas, Mexico, the team that was a runner-up in the Latin American championship.
    


            “I think this is the first time this has happened, but it shouldn't end this way. They're going to replace us with another team because relations have been severed; it's not fair,” Gutiérrez added. “I don't understand why they put Mexico in at the last minute and left Venezuela out.”

Russia will reinforce its Black Sea Fleet with marine robotic systems, warships, and additional aircraft, Nikolai Patrushev, the head of Russia's Maritime Collegium, said in an interview with the state-run RIA Novosti published on July 25. 

"In the coming years, the Black Sea sailors will be further strengthened — with the arrival of new frigates, corvettes, aviation, marine robotic complexes," Patrushev said. 

The Black Sea Fleet, headquartered in Sevastopol since Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, has suffered significant losses during the war against Ukraine. 

Ukrainian missile and drone strikes have forced the Kremlin to relocate part of the fleet away from occupied Crimea, reducing its operational presence in the region.

Despite these setbacks, Patrushev emphasized the fleet's strategic importance, claiming it remains critical for countering NATO and continuing military operations against Ukraine.

Ukraine has destroyed or disabled at least 29 Russian vessels, according to the Ukrainian General Staff. Among the most notable losses are the fleet's flagship, the Moskva, sunk in April 2022, the Caesar Kunikov and Sergei Kotov, along with numerous smaller landing crafts.

In June, Russian President Vladimir Putin approved a new naval doctrine aimed at restoring Russia's status as a global maritime power.

Patrushev, 74, a longtime ally of Putin and often described as the architect of Russia's war against Ukraine, has held influential positions in Russia's security apparatus for decades. 

He previously served as the secretary of the Security Council and was reportedly a key advocate for launching the full-scale invasion in 2022.

Russia's navy remains the third most powerful in the world, according to public assessments, but the full-scale war has exposed vulnerabilities in its Black Sea operations, where Ukraine has managed to push back one of the Kremlin's most prized military assets.

VILNIUS, July 26. /TASS/. Vilnius will allocate 30 mln euros for the purchase of US Patriot anti-aircraft missile systems for Ukraine, Lithuanian Defense Minister Dovile Sakaliene told the BNS agency following a meeting of Baltic states' defense chiefs with their American colleague Pete Hegseth.

"Lithuania has announced its position that it will join the purchase of US-produced weapons, specifically the acquisition of Patriot systems, allocating about 30 mln euros for this purpose," the agency quoted the minister as saying.

"In this way, we are sending a strategic message that we fully share this decision of US President Donald Trump," Sakaliene noted.

Trump said earlier that Washington would continue transferring weapons and military equipment to Ukraine if Europe pays for the supplies. Coordination will be carried out by NATO. According to the American president, the deliveries will include 17 Patriot systems.

On Monday, the Department of Defense announced that it had awarded a massive new contract to build the nation's largest migrant detention camp on the Fort Bliss military base, a facility that will play a key role in the Trump administration's deportation plans.

Unmentioned was that one of the subcontractors slated to work on the project, Disaster Management Group, is owned by Nathan Albers, who previously co-owned a company that pleaded guilty in 2019 to a scheme to hire undocumented workers and conceal them from immigration authorities. Albers is a big-time Republican donor who has spent time at Mar-a-Lago.

Two people with direct knowledge of the award and two familiar with the company told ProPublica that Disaster Management Group would help build the new facility, receiving a substantial chunk of the more than $1.2 billion the government has allocated for the project.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

“The idea that you could use illegal labor and then sell services to ICE, the irony is thick,” said Scott Shuchart, a former official with the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement during President Donald Trump's first term and later under President Joe Biden, referring to the immigration case involving TentLogix, the company Albers once co-owned.

In response to questions from ProPublica, a spokesperson for Disaster Management said that Albers and Disaster Management had been dropped from the DHS' investigation of TentLogix and exonerated. Upon learning of illegal actions by TentLogix's co-founder, the spokesperson said, “Mr. Albers parted ways as a minority and non-operating owner of TentLogix.”

The spokesperson didn't directly answer questions about Disaster Management's role in the detention camp at Fort Bliss, saying only that the company “is proud to support projects of national importance for nearly 20 years.”

The White House didn't answer questions about Disaster Management or Albers, referring ProPublica to the DOD and DHS, neither of which provided comment.

The new migrant detention camp near El Paso, Texas, is expected to hold up to 5,000 people. The prime contractor is Virginia-based Acquisition Logistics, and people with direct knowledge of the work at Fort Bliss told ProPublica that Amentum, a major engineering and technology services contractor, will be another subcontractor.

Neither Acquisition Logistics nor Amentum replied to questions from ProPublica about the project.

Disaster Management specializes in building temporary structures. Since 2020, it's won over $500 million in government contracting work, mostly to construct lodgings for a U.S. program to resettle Afghan refugees.

Last year, the Department of Labor announced that it had found Disaster Management and subcontractors it worked with on the Afghan refugee contract violated federal labor laws, including those on minimum wages and overtime. The agency recovered nearly $16 million in pay for workers, and Disaster Management signed a compliance agreement with the agency designed to prevent further violations. The company didn't respond to questions about the case.

Albers' ties to TentLogix wouldn't have excluded him or Disaster Management from other government contracting work, explained Scott Amey, the general counsel at the Project On Government Oversight.

TentLogix reported its criminal conviction in the federal contracting database, but Albers and his other businesses are considered separate legal entities. Companies awarded federal contracts are required to certify that they operate with a satisfactory record of business ethics, but “a lot of things are not required to be reported,” Amey said. “I don't even think this would appear on the radar of a contracting officer.”

Still, there's a web of connections between TentLogix and Disaster Management. Albers was one of TentLogix's two directors when it pleaded guilty to violating immigration law. The other, Gary Hendry, co-founded Disaster Management with Albers, and the two were once brothers-in-law. When immigration authorities raided TentLogix in 2018, it shared an address with Disaster Management.

The raid followed a 2016 Homeland Security Investigations audit of Tentlogix, which found the company had 96 undocumented employees on its books. According to court records, Hendry then attempted to deceive investigators by creating a shell company and transferring the undocumented workers to that entity to conceal them from Homeland Security Investigations auditors. But the agency discovered the scheme and found undocumented workers at the company's site when officials raided it in 2018. That year, Albers was listed as one of four officers on the company's corporate filings.

In 2019, Hendry pleaded guilty to immigration charges alongside another company officer and was sentenced to a year in prison. (He served a little over three months, then was granted an early release because of the pandemic.) TentLogix, the corporate entity, also pleaded guilty and was ordered to forfeit over $3 million. Although Albers was not personally charged, he signed off on the company's guilty plea, court records show. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2020.

Hendry did not respond to a request for comment.

Disaster Management's federal contracting work has been lucrative for Albers. Last year, he purchased a $30 million house in Jupiter, Florida, that then ranked as the area's most expensive home.

Albers also has recently become a large donor to Republican campaigns, to which he's given more than $150,000 in the last year alone. He and his wife spent election night at Mar-a-Lago in 2024 and once co-chaired a charity fundraiser at the Trump National Golf Club with the president's son, Eric, and his wife. They attended the “Crypto Ball,” a cryptocurrency event sponsored by Trump supporters in the digital currency industry; participants paid between $2,500 and $1 million for tickets. (The Trump Organization did not respond to questions from ProPublica.)

Since late last year, Disaster Management has spent $210,000 lobbying Congress and the administration on immigration-related issues, including “funding related to temporary facilities.” The company had no prior history of lobbying, according to federal disclosures.

Disaster Management's share of the immigration detention contract for Fort Bliss could rank among the company's largest contracts.

The Fort Bliss award comes as immigration arrests have soared in recent months and ICE is running low on space to hold everyone it has detained. In the past, those arrested by ICE would mostly be housed in brick-and-mortar detention facilities.

But in its urgency to increase deportations, the Trump administration has turned to contractors to build so-called soft-sided facilities — tents with rigid structures inside — that can be set up much more quickly.

The administration has eyed military bases as locations to set up these new detention camps. In April, ICE announced a $3.8 billion award to build such a facility to Deployed Resources, which had operated the lion's share of the soft-sided facilities used in the past to temporarily house immigrants entering the country along the southern border.

ICE abruptly canceled that contract just days after it was announced without explanation. Now it appears Disaster Management could do much of that work. An industry insider estimated to ProPublica that Disaster Management's slice of the $1.2 billion contract at Fort Bliss could be worth hundreds of millions for the company in the next year, though it's not clear how the three contractors will split the work. Bloomberg first reported the total value of the Fort Bliss contract.

The facility at Fort Bliss is expected to be the first of many. Earlier in the month, Trump signed a spending bill that allocates $45 billion to build new migrant detention sites. Experts estimate this could roughly double the country's capacity for immigration detention from around 50,000 people to more than 100,000.

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

There's no cookie-cutter solution to confronting fascism; action must be grounded in analysis, says Robin D. G. Kelley.

The anti-colonial struggle for a free Palestine has reached a desperate point as the Israeli military regularly fires on starving Palestinians seeking aid and water. Meanwhile, the rise of fascism in the United States continues at an alarming pace, with unprecedented funding passed for Immigration and Customs Enforcement expansion as the public continues to witness masked kidnappings and disappearances.

Seventy-five years after the publication of Aimé Césaire's Discourse on Colonialism, Robin D.G. Kelley argues that the book still has important lessons to teach in the current historical moment. Fascist states are not a perversion of liberal democracies but rather their extension, and it is critically important that anti-fascism incorporates anti-colonial approaches.

In this exclusive interview for Truthout, Kelley offers a vision of the work needed on the left that goes beyond looking for answers or examples to follow. Kelley is a professor of U.S. history at the University of California, Los Angeles, and an author or editor of more than a dozen books, including Freedom Dreams and Hammer and Hoe. The interview that follows has been lightly edited for clarity and length.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

October Krausch: You started your remarks at the Socialism Conference by saying you're a better historian than activist. Why was it important to you to name that right at the top?

Robin D. G. Kelley: It's part of a larger point I was making about what it means to be at this conference where people are literally looking for answers. I think we have done an absolutely horrible job of understanding and analyzing both the conditions now and before. A lot of people want inspiration from me. They want me to get people inspired about the possible future and what we're going to do. Because I write about social movements, they want me to pull out examples, and that's not useful to me. I specifically gave a lecture that was about understanding the things that are not so clear to us: the close relationship between liberalism and fascism historically and in the present, and the fundamentally intertwined relationship between colonialism and fascism. That's what I do well. If someone says, “Well I need you to go out and get 40,000 signatures,” I can't do that.

Some people have decided that scholarship and analysis are less important than action. I'm not saying it's more important or less; I'm saying you can't separate it. By holding up action separate from critical analysis, we end up fetishizing this invention called the activist. And then they say, “Yeah, we love Robin because he's an activist.”

So that was my way of saying I don't want to be in a position where people say, “So what do we do?” Because that's for all of us as a collective to figure out. And I wanted people to listen and follow this analysis, which I think is useful, but not so much for literal lessons. I don't think history works that way. The lessons to me are the lessons that Césaire laid out [in Discourse on Colonialism] in terms of the relationship.

What you're saying reminds me of something I've learned from abolition: One of the problems with the criminal legal system is its cookie-cutter approach. We have essentially the exact same prison in Michigan and in Texas and in California, then the U.S. exports those prisons to Brazil and that's the “solution” for all kinds of harm. I've learned a lot by taking seriously that history doesn't work that way, the social world doesn't work that way, conflicts don't work that way. But you see that desire for a template to follow repeated all over. Very few things work that way and it creates a lot of harm.

Exactly. It's also that the powers that be want you to use a cookie-cutter approach. I feel like part of my whole project as a Marxist historian is to try to locate and understand what we can't see. That's what Karl Marx did. In Capital, Volume 1, Marx talks about the secret of the labor theory of value. All that value, you can't see it; it's hidden because it's in labor power.

There can never be a cookie-cutter approach because we've got to figure out what we don't see. I fear sometimes it's very easy to fall into the trap of empiricism. People would think, Well, of course because if something is empirical it means that we can actually locate it and see it. The problem is it's hiding other things that we can't see.

I've never been one to only write about the glories and the existence of working people because we have to understand what is it that reproduces work. Why is it that they're fighting in the first place? Why is it that they're losing? That means studying power. That means like reading all 925 pages or whatever it is of Project 2025. To me, that's just as important as reading personal narratives of working people winning.

At the keynote, you talked a lot about the continuity of fascism and liberal democracy, especially the continuity of fascism and colonialism. You offered that the establishment of Israel precisely in the era of formal international decolonization is a really powerful example of why we have fascism here in the United States today: Colonialism never ended and we will always have the problem of fascism if we're not thinking about those as intertwined things. Some of your examples were about anti-fascist struggles that were not anti-colonial or were anti-Black. Your lecture had me thinking about Sophie Lewis's recent book, Enemy Feminisms. One of the things Lewis says is that, as feminists, we have a tendency to define, say, anti-abortion feminists or KKK feminists, as outside of “real” feminism. Lewis says that we have to own that and then we have to think about where the seeds of domination and white supremacy lie inside of feminism. Do you think it makes sense to think in a similar way about enemy lefts or enemy socialisms?

The left has already done that. We call it sectarianism! Unfortunately, it's not always been done in the most thoughtful way. I think what Sophie Lewis is trying to do in the book is very thoughtful in terms of having a critical analysis of the positions that are within a framework of feminism. It's not to abandon feminism, but to really understand it. With the enemy socialism example, these folks are basically constructing enemies as a way of either trying to maintain or attain some kind of hegemony within left circles, or because they have a disagreement in analysis that's not a fundamental disagreement in values.

Part of my concern is actually the opposite. I understand enemy feminists, but once we start to do what the left has done for a long time — that is, attack those we disagree with as social fascists or as left opportunists — there's no opportunity to build through critique, dialogue, and struggle, which offers a way of understanding that maybe our critique is wrong.

For me, that's also about grace. There are some people in left organizations who I completely disagree with, including (and I struggle with this) the leftists who have a really bad position on race. I could make a decision to sort of expose and dispose of them, or to say, “Okay, let's critique that failure to understand race.”

I'm so frustrated with the Marxist-Leninists who are basically applauding Donald Trump because the Trump administration is getting rid of DEI [diversity, equity, and inclusion], like, “Well, that's great, because DEI is just a neoliberal trick.” For me, that's just dumb. So rather than say, “Oh, they're the enemy,” I write and argue and publicly speak against that position and explain why. I expect and want a response. Because to debate it and recognize that we share a lot in common is to pull people within that movement into ours.

I'm wrestling with some of these ideas and I think a lot of people are. When is someone your enemy? And when is it like, “Okay, we can travel together for a certain amount of time”? That's a difficult decision to make and there's no template for it. At the same time, we have to really draw some hard lines because people are going to sell us out when we're in these higher stakes.

I agree with that. I think there are times when we do have to draw hard lines. I guess what I'm also saying is that there's a value in making that critique as clear and public as possible. It doesn't have to be friendly.

There are basically a lot of racist white left organizations. They're everywhere. I dream about them at night. There are left tendencies that are deeply nationalist, which I think is problematic as well.

If we're trying to build a working-class power, then it doesn't make sense to ignore or vilify every single segment of the working class. It's enough to continue taking them to task and explaining why. In Hammer and Hoe, I wrote about Klansmen who end up joining the Communist Party because they saw it as maybe the best option, but they don't come politically correct. They would use like, comrade n*****. Communist Party members were like, “You can't say that,” but they wouldn't say, “You have to leave.” The Party would work with them as much as they could to bring them in, but at the same time, promote organic leadership. That's two really important things that may seem counterbalancing: to promote organic leadership and to promote and support people who may not actually know it all.

It's also important to listen and engage because if we really do believe we have the right position on everything, then we're living in a dreamworld. I've never known of a movement in my life that has the right position on everything. Even today, we're so advanced that we don't have the right position on everything. You don't know yet.

It's funny, it feels like a contradiction in and of itself to say, “Oh, I didn't know either and now I know this thing,” but you feel at any given moment in time like, “I have a bunch of strongly held beliefs. They're the correct beliefs.”

Right, there's nothing wrong with really believing that you have the correct belief. In fact, if you don't, why do you do it? The contradictions are high.

Part of what I was trying to say [in the keynote speech] was that too many of us, at least in my circle, stop at the recognition that fascism itself is a product of colonial rule. And then they end up falling into the shaft of creating the hierarchy of the colonized and the white people. Part of my discussion about austerity was to add another dimension to class struggle, saying that in order for colonialism to actually work, they had to crush the European working class. They had to make the working class not just nationalist, but weak enough to eliminate as much anti-imperialist sentiment as possible.

That means we have to go even deeper in our analysis of understanding the European working class. It's just not enough to analyze the world as if all the colonized are the oppressed and the white people are the oppressor. Because then we have no understanding of the BRICS countries, for example. That's what I'm saying: A lot of us, even those who think we have all the answers, don't have that analysis yet.

I was reminded in a recent panel at the Socialism Conference that the Vietnamese national liberation movement did win against more powerful militaries. That's easy to forget at a time when people here don't seem to feel that there is potential for big wins. But it happens and it's happened in history. Simultaneously, you highlight the way those victories are incomplete. And that's part of why we're still fighting fascism, right? How do you negotiate living in that tension?

Yes. Vietnam as a national liberation movement defeated the United States. Vietnam as a national liberation defeated France in 1954. Vietnam, just like Haiti. But I would argue that communism in Vietnam was defeated, even though the nation of Vietnam won in the short term.

What is Vietnam now? Vietnam, along with Bangladesh, produces much of the world's textiles from the lowest-paid workers. It's the continuation of the exploitation of labor in a place that fought to end the exploitation of labor. Most of those companies that do business making apparel in Vietnam are U.S. companies or multinational companies. Vietnam just made this trade deal with Trump. There is a rising Vietnamese elite, much like China. The Chinese Communist Party has become — and again, I have lots of debates with people about this — has become the organization, if you're a bureaucrat, where you can become a millionaire. That's not the vision that brought peasants and workers to the party. The victory is nevertheless a sign of the inability of U.S. imperialism to win everything it wants. But it's also the long-term defeat of communist vision and practice, and it's a sign that the capital order is intact and it ebbs and flows.

Capitalism is not going anywhere anytime soon unless we do something different. If we were to really take the question of why did Vietnam defeat the United States, we have to ask two other questions: What was the state of the United States at the time of its withdrawal? It was a global economic crisis and the U.S. economy was in shambles in many ways. The price of the war was just too much. What made the price of war go up? Working people in the United States. All those struggles in the '60s and early '70s to expand the welfare state made government spending higher. The War on Poverty was a minuscule amount of money but, nevertheless, it was competing with the war expenditure.

The result of the global realignment that has happened since that time is that the combined power of China, Russia, India, Brazil, South Africa and Saudi Arabia outweighs the United States. What did these BRICS countries produce? Did they produce the beautiful, amazing welfare state of the non-aligned movements? No, they created massive inequality and state repression, all the things that are required to maintain colonial and fascist power. So we're still here. I'm not trying to be pessimistic, but this is the nature of class struggle. The grounds keep shifting on us. And if you don't see the grounds as global, then we end up not knowing who or how to fight or how things happen behind our backs.

This is why we don't need slogans. We need answers. And we can't have answers without really good questions. We can't have good questions without knowing the history. And it comes down to that. I think about what it means that someone like Vladimir Lenin, who was kind of busy, would write an entire book-length study on agriculture in the U.S.

Marxists have always been immersed in history, but we're not so much anymore. It's not about the left, it's about our culture altogether. And again, it also goes back to the activist ethos, and this notion that to be activists, we need action now. That's kind of a fetish. When political education ends up becoming, “What are the immediate strategic issues that we need to deal with now?” rather than developing a larger analysis, that's a little bit of anti-intellectualism.

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

Before the genocide, malnutrition was a rare diagnosis. Now more than 2 million Gazans are forced to survive on nothing.

I first learned about malnutrition from textbooks and documentaries in my medical school. I followed the scenes of hunger emerging from Somalia and South Sudan. I wholeheartedly felt them — with every sip of potable water I drank while theirs was polluted, with each bite of food I ate while they were reduced to skin and bones. Yet I never imagined that one day, I would be in their place — subjected not just to killing, but also to starvation and malnutrition.

Malnutrition, as defined by the World Health Organization, is a deficiency, excess, or imbalance in a person's intake of energy and nutrients. It may be caused by reduced dietary intake, malabsorption of macro- and micronutrients, or increased energy expenditure related to disease. But in Gaza, the meaning of malnutrition has been forcibly redefined — it is systematically human-made and weaponized. It is no longer just a health condition, but a calculated strategy. Since March 2, Israeli forces have sealed off the borders and imposed what may be the tightest blockade in our history of struggle, deliberately restricting food access.

Before the genocide, malnutrition was a rare diagnosis. Today, more than 2 million Gazans are forced to survive on nothing. Flour is scarce. Canned food is consumed while fresh vegetables remain a distant dream, unavailable or unaffordable. Aid parcels — meant to save lives — may cost a Palestinian their life, as Gaza's humanitarian “relief” system has become a death trap disguised as mercy.

In Gaza, the meaning of malnutrition has been forcibly redefined — it is systematically human-made and weaponized. 

We have been forced not only to skip meals, but also to skip entire days of eating, exposing our bodies to lethal complications. Acute malnutrition is not just about hunger or weight loss. It attacks every organ system, bringing severe risks of illness and death — especially for the young and the elderly. My nephews, born and raised under genocide, have had no chance to build strength or immunity. Pale and emaciated, with fragile bodies, they fight disease with nothing but weakness.

Malnutrition impairs the immune system, leaving us defenseless against disease. I, myself, became vulnerable to the simplest infections — bedridden for days, even weeks, unable to function. Malnutrition doesn't just cause illness, it prolongs it. It adds layers to our suffering, and offers no escape from its vicious cycle.

Malnutrition also attacks the cardiovascular system — decreasing cardiac output, disrupting blood flow, and causing arrhythmia, low blood pressure, and even heart failure. I suffered tachycardia (a too-fast heart rate), nausea, and fainting spells caused by severe deficiency. For the elderly — especially those with preexisting heart conditions — this is a death sentence.

Deficiencies in essential vitamins and minerals impair memory, concentration, and cognition. I suffer these effects daily, trying to study while living under the shadow of death.

The gastrointestinal system suffers too, if not immediately, then over time. Malnutrition impairs the intestines' ability to absorb nutrients and regulate electrolytes. Living off canned food for nearly two years has inflamed my peptic ulcers and worsened my colitis.

As a medical student, I knew what might help even a little. I once kept a supply of supplementary vitamins, but now due to Israel's blockade, vitamins are impossible to access. 

Recently, a diabetic patient died during a hypoglycemic attack — his family couldn't find a single sweet to save him. Mothers across Gaza are unable to breastfeed their starving infants — because they themselves are starving. UN agencies have distributed therapeutic food, but it's nowhere near enough. Most mothers give it to their children and go hungry themselves.

Malnutrition doesn't stop at the body — it invades the mind. It disrupts serotonin production, causing severe depression, anxiety, and emotional instability. Deficiencies in essential vitamins and minerals impair memory, concentration, and cognition. I suffer these effects daily, trying to study while living under the shadow of death. My memory falters, my thoughts scatter. Children deprived of nutrition face lifelong consequences to their growth, both mental and physical.

Malnutrition also delays healing and worsens clinical outcomes. I spoke to Rawan Y., a fellow medical student and survivor of a genocidal injury. She told me: “I got injured on March 2 and was discharged on March 17. Back then, we were on the edge of famine. Then famine invaded. I underwent three surgeries. I was supposed to get the nutritious food I needed for recovery — but the reality was the stark opposite.”

She paused, her voice cracking.

“I live with the torment of knowing what's happening inside my body. I know the damage. I had spleen and kidney injuries, first-degree burns, and three broken ribs. It's been four months — and my wounds remain unhealed, painful, and persistent.”

Dr. Mohammed Altalla, who works as a doctor in a surgical department in Gaza and also serves as a teaching assistant in the faculty of medicine at Gaza's Al Azhar University, confirmed the devastating toll of malnutrition on recovery:

“One of the major consequences of malnutrition is delayed healing. Proteins, vitamins, and zinc are simply unavailable. Surgical site infections have surged – we deal with them daily,” he told me. 

“People collapse in the streets, rushed to hospitals. The life-saving intervention in many cases is as simple as glucose. But even that is running out.” 

I also spoke with Shaimaa Bashir, a clinical nutritionist working with a humanitarian organization on the ground in Gaza. She told me that acute malnutrition has risen by 146 percent in just three months. “Hundreds of thousands of patients are hospitalized daily with complications from malnutrition — irregular heartbeats, dangerously low blood pressure,” she said. “Many were already vulnerable even before their injuries — now it's far worse.”

Moreover, Bashir notes: “Since mid-May 2025, Gaza has been in an unprecedented severe food emergency. Ninety-three percent of the population faces food insecurity. Twenty-two percent are now in phase five — the catastrophic phase — of hunger. If no aid arrives, we expect the entire population will fall into phase four — acute severe malnutrition — by September 2025.”

Meanwhile, 17,000 women who are pregnant or breastfeeding desperately need medical nutrition, but none is available due to severe drug shortages and constant displacement. A malnourished mother may pass her malnutrition to her infant — or face miscarriage.

Bashir added that feeding options for patients are almost nonexistent. “We have no access to therapeutic food, IV nutrition, or nasogastric tubes,” she said. “The only remaining source is supplementary sweets for children — and even that is in short supply.”

“People collapse in the streets, rushed to hospitals. The life-saving intervention in many cases is as simple as glucose. But even that is running out,” Altalla said. 

Then he paused, his voice quieter: “It's not just the patients. We — the medical staff — are barely functioning. We struggle to stay focused ourselves.”

“The food situation is so dire that every day the question arises whether the patients in the hospitals we support and the medical staff who care for them will be able to eat anything at all,” echoed Caroline Willemen, a project coordinator in Gaza City for Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders), in a statement. “We are desperate. As an occupying power the Israeli authorities have an obligation to provide aid to people in Gaza. Right now, they are deliberately starving them.”

The health of more than 2 million people hangs in the balance, clinging to the hope of aid trucks that never come.

Each delay is a death sentence.

Each denied truck is a stolen chance at survival.

Malnutrition is preventable. It is reversible.

But not under Israel's siege.

The only way to stop this engineered starvation is to open the borders — to let food in, to let Palestinians live.

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

BUDAPEST, July 26. /TASS/. The threat of a third world war keeps growing, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said, adding that the international community should do everything it can to prevent it.

"Perhaps the most important question now is whether there will be a third world war, and the answer is that the likelihood of a world war is constantly increasing," he said in an address broadcast by the M1 TV channel.

As evidence, Orban cited the results of polls in six major countries, whose citizens consider the threat of a new world war to be quite real. The opinion that "in 5-10 years a third world war will break out is held by 55% of the French, 50% of the Spanish, 46% of the Italians, 45% of the Americans, 41% of the British, and 41% of the Germans," the premier added." "The whole world feels the cold wind of war," he noted.

For years the U.S. stock market sucked the air out of the world's markets. At its peak, it accounted for more than half of the world's publicly-traded capital. But now, money has begun returning home.ANGELA WEISS/AFP/Getty Images

John Rapley is a contributing columnist for The Globe and Mail. He is an author and academic whose books include Why Empires Fall and Twilight of the Money Gods.

Stock markets are probing fresh heights. Among the G7 economies, only Italy's isn't in record territory and even Japan, which looked to have entered terminal decline after its 1990 crash, is now back within touching distance of those long-ago highs. House prices as well are near their all-time highs in most places, slightly off their recent peaks but still far above where they ever were before. And that's nothing compared with crypto and gold – bitcoin is up more than a quarter this year, gold nearly a third.

In short, we're getting richer by the day. Which is kind of strange, because our economies are barely moving. Of the major economies, only the United States has shown any significant expansion recently and even that is now slowing rapidly. Reflecting this new deceleration, the corporate-earnings season now under way in the United States is turning out to be a dud, with profit growth coming in well below the rate of share-price increases. 

In short, the strength of market rallies doesn't reflect what's happening in economies, which are weak and getting weaker. So what's going on?

Some of it is rebalancing. Talk of all-time highs in the U.S. stock market cloud the reality – the U.S. is the laggard, it's stock market up a mere 5 per cent since President Donald Trump took office and 8 per cent for the year, a far cry from Germany's 22 per cent or Hong Kong's 28 per cent. Currency effects make the discrepancy even more dramatic, leaving the U.S. market down in euro and peso terms, and pretty much flat in Canadian dollars.

Lofty U.S. stock valuations bank on tech-heavy market's earnings strength

For years the U.S. stock market sucked the air out of the world's markets. At its peak, it accounted for more than half of the world's publicly traded capital, the Magnificent Seven tech stocks alone having a combined value bigger than any other stock market on the planet. But now, money has begun returning home. That explains the weakening of the dollar. Given how much smaller than the U.S. these markets are, flows of this scale have an outsized impact on prices. As a result, the laggards of the past decade, such as Spain, Hong Kong, South Africa and Britain, have become winners, with a small share of repatriated investment making for big rallies.

This rebalancing was always bound to happen at some point, but Mr. Trump's policies are accelerating it. Though presenting the trade “deals” he's now rolling out as wins, because other countries have to “pay” higher tariffs than the U.S., it's an odd victory when your consumers must pay more for their goods than foreigners. After Mr. Trump announced his trade deal with Japan this week, Toyota's share price shot up 15 per cent, but Ford's barely budged. That's because the price of a Toyota car will increase by 15 per cent, but Ford's will probably rise more, since the company must pay tariffs on all its inputs.

The same is happening in bond markets, where the spread between U.S. government bonds and those of other countries, especially emerging markets, is narrowing. As the U.S. looks less investable, other countries lure capital back away from it.

To this reallocation of investment one can add the massive amount of stimulus now entering the global pipeline – the tax cuts in Mr. Trump's Big Beautiful Bill, Germany's big stimulus program, NATO's rearmament, Japan's fiscal loosening: There's a lot of bond issuance coming, which will pump money into the world economy. The monetary tightening that had followed the 2021-22 inflation spike has now given way to an increase in global money supply that's running at an annual rate of more than 7 per cent.

Opinion: The triple contradiction of Trumponomics could crash the world economy

But what's good for markets isn't necessarily good for the economy. In the U.S., first-time homebuyers are spending a higher share of their income on mortgage payments today than they were before the 2008 crash, leaving less to spend or invest on other things, while squeezing future demand. The same is happening in Canada, and as we know one consequence of the rising cost of living is that voters are demanding a reduction in immigration. If voters don't always favour the harsh measures being taken against immigrants in the U.S., nonetheless virtually all Western countries are starting to clamp down on inflows. That is cutting off one of the few remaining sources of growth in Western economies, namely the rise in labour supply.

Sooner or later, in short, markets will realign with the economy. Unless the latter picks up, the former are sure to fall. At the moment, a slowdown looks the more likely scenario. Whatever stimulus effects come from government's fiscal largesse, the impact of tariffs and slow growth in the labour market owing to immigration cutbacks will drag down growth. Investors are still pricing shares as if the good days will keep rolling. But this fall may bring a chill to markets.

Andy Filipowich is a high school teacher by day, but a prolific Wikipedia editor by night.Galit Rodan/The Globe and Mail

The bronze bust of William Lyon Mackenzie sits on a tall plinth tucked away in Toronto's Queen's Park. He has a defiant expression, befitting the rebel leader against Upper Canada, and a swooping hairdo that looks like a bird perched atop his head. 

Earlier this summer, Andy Filipowich was here to take in the statue. He's a high school teacher by day, but a prolific Wikipedia editor by night. 

The 36-year-old is one of the editors of Mackenzie's Wikipedia page, whose meticulous writing and citing led the article to be featured on the website's front page – arguably one of the highest distinctions for a Wikipedia editor. That day, more than 25,000 people read the article.

“You can only stumble upon it if you're physically in the space,” Mr. Filipowich says about the statue. “But in the online world, anyone can stumble on any information.”

Since Wikipedia was founded nearly a quarter of a century ago, fortified by co-founder Jimmy Wales's goal to “help the internet not suck,” it has consistently ranked as one of the top 10 most visited websites worldwide. 

Free of ads and profit-seeking corporate overlords, and maintained by dedicated volunteers, Wikipedia is arguably one of the last best places on the internet.

In any given month, Wikipedia gets more than four billion page views globally, but only a tiny sliver of those visitors will actually make edits to the website. An army of volunteers writes and edits article pages, removes vandalism and misinformation, and adds citations. The internet runs on these kinds of quiet acts of online altruism: the unsung heroes who upload fresh menus on Google, moderate Reddit forums, or post honest product reviews on Amazon amid the flood of fake ones. 

Over the past two decades, Wikipedia has faced various threats, including censorship from hostile governments and nefarious sock puppet accounts hijacking articles. But every time, the website has fought back and adapted to the changing tides of the internet. Now, however, it faces an existential threat. Editors are fearful that as more people use AI chatbots such as ChatGPT or Gemini to find information, they won't need Wikipedia. 

For Mr. Filipowich, and the more than hundred thousand active editors, the survival of Wikipedia has never been more important. 

Andy Filipowich's first big project was overhauling William Lyon Mackenzie's Wikipedia page.Galit Rodan/The Globe and Mail

A Canadian history buff, Mr. Filipowich has been an active editor since 2020. While sitting at home during COVID lockdown, he clicked the “random article” button on Wikipedia's main page and landed on a gas explosion in Toronto's Etobicoke neighbourhood in the early 2000s. The article didn't have much information, so he started adding new details. He caught the bug, as he describes it, and kept editing other Wikipedia articles. 

Mr. Filipowich's first big project was overhauling Mackenzie's page to bring it up to “featured article” status, which Wikipedia considers the best work on the site and only grants to 0.1 per cent of all articles. For a year, he read multiple biographies, dug through newspaper archives and made tweaks based on feedback from other editors. 

Hannah Clover, a 22-year-old from the Niagara region in Ontario, started editing Wikipedia when she was in high school. At 16, she created the page for Canadian journalist and archivist Katherine Hughes, which was featured on Wikipedia's front page in the “Did you know” section. “I was completely ecstatic the whole day,” says Ms. Clover. “I kept refreshing the main page and going, ‘I wrote that one sentence!'”

Earlier this year, she wrote Wikipedia's first article ever on ketchup chips, excavating every mention she could find of the food in newspaper archives and reading a book about the history of Canadian snacks. She writes book plot summaries, too, as well as descriptions of landmarks in the Niagara region. When she discovered the Niagara Falls Public Library didn't have a photo on its article page, she hiked around the city, snapping shots of every branch to add to the website's licence-free media archive. Last year, Ms. Clover was named “Wikimedian of the year,” an annual award that honours an editor's contributions. 

How Wikipedia became one of the greatest achievements of the modern age

For Ms. Clover, part of her motivation is the community she's built. She's made a lot of friends on Wikipedia, finding kinship with fellow nerds who are happy to geek out about the credibility of sources and discuss ways to improve the website. 

“A big part of what makes me stay is the community, because people get me. It's like a bunch of bookworms everywhere,” she says. 

That sense of community is also what keeps Enoch Leung, 27, volunteering with Wikipedia. He started editing when he was 12, and over the next couple years, began working on some of the maintenance aspects of Wikipedia, such as monitoring new edits for vandalism. He's attended meetups with other Toronto-based editors, including recently visiting the Toronto Islands to take photos for Wikimedia Commons. 

“In a world where the internet feels increasingly dystopian as algorithms dictate what we see and think … it's refreshing to be part of a website that isn't any of that – and perhaps a little intimidating too,” says Mr. Leung. 

Wikipedia is not without its flaws. There's a stark gender gap among its editors – about 80 per cent are men – and in its content too, with women accounting for only 20 per cent of biographical entries. Wikipedia has also been accused of both being too conservative and too progressive. Earlier this year, Elon Musk said it's “an extension of legacy media propaganda” and called for the website to be “defunded.”

But the biggest concern right now is AI chatbots. 

People are increasingly using chatbots to seek out information they would have once found on Wikipedia. (Ironically the website is one of the most widely used data sources for AI training models owing to its open licence.) Some editors and researchers worry fewer people will visit the website directly. And that means fewer opportunities to attract potential new editors – the lifeblood of the platform. 

Opinion: Elon Musk's hate for Wikipedia reveals his true views on free speech

“Wikipedia is this economic anomaly. In many ways, it's sort of magical that people will just volunteer without explicit economic incentives to create artifacts that are meant to share knowledge with everyone in the world,” says Nicholas Vincent, an assistant professor at Simon Fraser University who has studied how Wikipedia helps support Google searches. “And so fundamentally anything that threatens to cut off traffic to the actual Wikipedia platform threatens all those things.” 

Mr. Filipowich, the high school teacher, is concerned that Wikipedia could become a relic of the past if overall readership declines. But he's also hopeful that Wikipedia can find ways to use AI to grow as a site, such as using it to translate articles into other languages. It may just take time to figure out what those best-use cases are. 

“I remember going through school and Wikipedia being the new big scary thing in education,” Mr. Filipowich says. “AI has become the new form of that, and I just think it's because we don't quite know how to use it yet.” 

Dr. Vincent says there are ways in which tech companies like OpenAI and Google can help prevent the deterioration of Wikipedia, including by changing the design of their chatbots to encourage users to click through to the website.

Ms. Clover is concerned about AI slop infiltrating the website, how the chatbots can make up information, including sources, and how that could lead to a greater distrust online. However, she's not too worried about AI leading to a decline in editors. 

Over Google Meet, she pulls up a graph showing the change in the frequency of edits from 2006 to 2020. The line is remarkably consistent throughout the past 14 years. 

“And how different is the world compared to how it was in 2006? I think we'll get through this.” 

Walking around Queen's Park earlier this summer, Mr. Filipowich was quick to pull out his phone and look up facts on Wikipedia – how old Mackenzie was when he died (66) or to confirm the alibi of a former Toronto mayor accused of being at the Upper Canada Rebellion (he wouldn't be wearing sunglasses at night, like his accuser claimed). 

The statues dotted throughout the park also served as reminders of Mr. Filipowich's to-do list of articles he wants to update. His current big project is the page of George Brown, the 19th century politician and founder of The Globe, to featured article status. He's about three-quarters through one of Brown's two-volume biographies. The work of the Wikipedia editor never ends.

Under the agreement reached between President Donald Trump and Columbia University regarding campus anti-Semitism, the Ivy League school will pay a $200 million fine to regain its eligibility for future federal money.

The July 23 settlement follows months of discussions between the two sides after Trump froze $400 million in federal grants to the school and accused its leaders of failing to address the harassment of Jewish students and campus disruptions.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko is again using his country's territory to funnel illegal migrants from Africa, the Middle East, and Afghanistan toward the European Union, Ukraine's Foreign Intelligence Service said on July 26. 

According to the agency, Lukashenko is facilitating transit primarily to Poland, with some migrants arriving from Libya directly or through Russia — pointing to coordinated efforts between Minsk and Moscow.

This mirrors tactics used in 2021, when Belarus orchestrated mass migrant crossings into EU states in what Brussels condemned as a form of hybrid warfare. The effort was widely seen as an attempt to blackmail the bloc into easing sanctions on Lukashenko's regime.

"This blackmail did not work," Ukraine's intelligence service said, noting that the response instead intensified Belarus' diplomatic isolation.

While Lukashenko reportedly profits from the migrant flows, he has so far avoided full-scale escalation, likely in an effort to preserve his few remaining political ties in Europe. 

Hungary, which has taken a hard line against illegal migration, has remained one of the few EU states maintaining dialogue with Minsk.

"Lukashenko, despite his reputation as a satellite of Russia's dictator Vladimir Putin, retains autonomy in matters of tactics — and once again demonstrates a willingness to use it to exert political pressure on the West," the agency said.

Poland, one of the EU's front-line states, has long accused Belarus and Russia of waging a hybrid war by deliberately directing migrants toward its borders. 

Warsaw reported stopping 26,000 illegal crossing attempts in 2024 alone. One soldier was killed and 63 others injured in related border clashes.

Polish officials have pointed to a growing number of migrants carrying Russian visas, linking the wave directly to the Kremlin's broader confrontation with the West.

Lukashenko has ruled Belarus since 1994 and remains a key ally of the Kremlin. His regime has allowed Russian troops and equipment to use Belarusian territory to attack Ukraine at the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022.

Ukrainian drones struck the Signal radio plant in Russia's Stavropol Krai overnight on July 26, a source in Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent.

The plant, located around 500 kilometers (311 miles) from Ukraine-controlled territory, manufactures electronic warfare equipment for front-line aircraft and is a major part of Russia's military-industrial complex. 

One of the strikes targeted a building housing expensive imported equipment, including computer numerical control machines, the source said. The second strike hit a separate building that hosts an electronic devices workshop.

"The SBU continues to systematically disable enemy (Russia's) facilities working for the war against Ukraine," the source said. "Each such attack stops production processes and reduces the enemy's military potential."

The facility is sanctioned by the European Union, the U.S., Ukraine, and Japan. Russian independent media outlet Astra published video footage allegedly showing a direct drone strike on one of the facility's buildings.

Stavropol Krai Governor Vladimir Vladimirov confirmed the attack, saying drones targeted industrial facilities in the region and caused a small fire. No casualties were reported.

Russia's Defense Ministry claimed that its forces shot down 54 Ukrainian drones overnight across eight Russian regions. The ministry did not report any drones being intercepted over Stavropol Krai.

Founded in 1971, the Signal plant is one of the largest defense enterprises in the North-Caucasian Federal District. It produces active jamming systems, remote weapon-control modules, and other radio-electronic equipment. 

It operates under Rostec's KRET cluster, a central structure in Russia's defense sector.

On July 25, Ukrainian drones hit a chemical plant in the same region. Ukraine's military regularly strikes military targets deep within Russia in an attempt to diminish Moscow's fighting power as it continues its war.

            Retired CIA official Susan Miller, an author of the agency's 2017 intelligence report on Russian election meddling, is vowing to fight any potential criminal charges brought by the Trump administration.
    


            Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has accused the Obama administration of manufacturing the intelligence report, which assessed that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to help Donald Trump, and said she made criminal referrals to the Justice Department.
    


            “My team and I, just yesterday, had a few drinks and talked about that, and talked about what lawyers we'd be looking for, if that happens,” Miller told CNN's Kaitlan Collins on “The Source” on Friday.
    


            “But I'll do it. I'll fight, I'll fight to the end,” she added.
    


            Pushing back against Gabbard's accusations, Miller said that no one – including then-President Barack Obama or then-CIA Director John Brennan – had told her team what conclusion to reach in their report. “Absolutely not,” she said. She added that she and her team would have quit if they had faced such pressure.
    


            Miller said the intelligence that helped them reach their conclusion “was extremely sound and it was verified.” Miller also said her team briefed Trump at the time.
    


            She went on to say that the report's findings were “not at all” based on the so-called Steele dossier, which was included as an addendum.
    


            The infamous dossier was written by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, and funded by Hillary Clinton's campaign. It alleged coordination between the Russian government and people associated with the Trump campaign, though its ultimate credibility was limited.
    


            While Miller's team “could determine that 100%” Russia tried to influence the 2016 election, it's indeterminable whether Moscow's efforts worked, Miller said.
    


            “But the bottom line is, yes, they tried to influence it. No, unless we poll every voter as to why they voted, we can't tell you if that worked. And therefore, from our perspective, Trump is our president. And we just left it at that,” she told CNN.
    


            In a statement, the White House praised Gabbard and described the 2017 intelligence report and its findings as a “total hoax and political witch hunt to snub President Trump's historic first term in office.”
    


            “I think it is wrong in every single way,” Miller told CNN in response and warned of Gabbard's attacks against the report and its findings.
    


            “What Tulsi is saying is: ‘We only want to hear anything that's pro-Trump, pro-Trump policy … pro-current Republican Party from any of our intel services, and if we hear anything that's not that, then we're going to come after you.' And that's what it feels like. And so, what analyst wants to put his or her, their name on any paper now?” she said.
    


            Miller said she and her team told the truth and the information was well sourced.
    


            “We looked at everything, and we're being now told that we somehow did it wrong, we didn't have analysts involved, when three of my team were analysts. We had rigorous analytic reviews by our then-head of analysis. And it just, it doesn't make sense to me. It just doesn't. It really is sad.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Bryce Harper homered deep into the right-field bleachers and Kyle Schwarber hit a two-run double after New York's 10th error in five games, sparking the Philadelphia Phillies to a 9-4 win Saturday over the reeling Yankees, who avoided a major injury scare with captain Aaron Judge.

Trea Turner drove in two runs and Edmundo Sosa also homered for the Phillies, who opened a 9-1 lead. Philadelphia started the day a half-game behind the NL East-leading New York Mets.

Schwarber had six RBIs and Turner was 6 for 11 as Philadelphia outscored New York 21-9 in the first two games of the three-game series.

Ranger Suárez (8-4) allowed one run and seven hits in 5 2/3 innings with eight strikeouts and one walk, throwing a season-high 108 pitches.

Judge was out of the Yankees' starting lineup for just the second time this season. His elbow has been bothering him since a throw Tuesday at Toronto, and manager Aaron Boone said the two-time AL MVP had a scan that revealed a flexor strain but no damage to the ulnar collateral ligament. Judge will go on the injured list and be the designated hitter initially when he returns, Boone said.

New York began the day a season-high 5 1/2 games behind AL East-leading Toronto and dropped to 3-5 since the All-Star break.

Schwarber doubled after second baseman Jazz Chisholm Jr. bobbled Turner's potential inning-ending, double-play grounder in the seventh, Chisholm's 12th error this season.




Ryan McMahon went 1 for 3 with a walk in his Yankees debut, a day after the third baseman was acquired from Colorado for a pair of pitching prospects.

Marcus Stroman (2-2) allowed four runs, five hits and four walks in 3 2/3 innings.

Sosa hit a two-run homer in the seventh off Allan Winans and Giancarlo Stanton hit a two-run drive against Daniel Robert in the bottom half.

Sosa left with a bruised back after the third baseman was elbowed by left fielder Brandon Marsh in a collision while catching Chisholm's seventh-inning popup.

New York is 21-28 following a 35-20 start.

New York LHP Carlos Rodón (10-7, 3.10) and Philadelphia RHP Zack Wheeler (9-3, 2.39) start Sunday's series finale.

The fortunes of the Democratic Party continue to tank, with a new poll giving the party its lowest favorability rating in 35 years.

The poll from the Wall Street Journal found 63% of voters have an unfavorable view of the Democratic Party, compared to 33% who hold a favorable view. This is compared to the 11% deficit in unfavorability suffered by the Republican Party. Enthusiasm is also on the Republicans' side — just 8% of voters view the Democrats “very favorably,” while 19% view the Republicans “very favorably.”

The poll found another pattern — Republicans were able to reap the benefits of Trump's popularity while insulating themselves from his more unpopular stances. For example, voters disapproved of Trump's handling of tariffs by a massive 17 points, yet trusted Republicans more than Democrats on the issue by 7 points. Trump's handling of inflation has an 11-point deficit, yet voters trust Republicans more on the issue by 10 points.

The only issues Democrats enjoyed more confidence in were healthcare and vaccines.

The dismal Democratic rating reflects the uniquely bad position the party finds itself in. The party has been unable to come up with a coherent message after being routed by Trump and the Republicans in November, failing to satisfy centrists looking to moderate their image and leftists hoping to intensify their message.

The current dissatisfaction comes from three main angles — centrists believing the party has gone too far to the left, leftists who believe the party has gone too far to the center, and resistance Democrats who believe the party isn't fighting Trump hard enough.

IN UGLY DEMOCRATIC FEUD, BOTH SIDES DESERVE TO LOSE

Polls on Trump's approval rating have varied drastically over the past month, with the Wall Street Journal putting it at 46%, though substantially higher than at this point in his first term, when it was at 40%.

The poll surveyed 1,500 registered voters from July 16-20. The margin of error is plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.

YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) — Cameroon 's electoral commission on Saturday rejected the candidacy of Maurice Kamto in the upcoming presidential election, fueling fears of unrest and increasing the likelihood of another Biya victory.

Kamto, a former government minister, is seen as the main challenger to long-serving President Paul Biya.

The electoral commission, ELECAM, said it approved 13 presidential candidates, excluding Kamto. No reason was given. Biya is included.

Kamto, who has two days to appeal, was considered Biya's strongest rival in past elections. He came second during the last presidential election in 2018 with 14% of the vote, while Biya cruised to victory with over 70% in an election marred by irregularities and a low turnout.

Biya, 92, the world's oldest serving head of state, said last month he would seek reelection on Oct. 12 despite rumors that his health is failing. He has been in power since 1982, nearly half his lifetime.

Biya's rule has left a lasting impact on Cameroon. His government has faced various challenges, including allegations of corruption and a deadly secessionist conflict in the nation's English-speaking provinces that has forced thousands out of school.

Fears of protests and unrest surged around Saturday's release of the list of approved candidates.

Security forces were deployed around the ELECAM headquarters and along major roads in Yaoundé, the capital, and in Douala, the economic hub.

The United Nations Department of Safety and Security had warned Friday that the announcement could trigger protests in the capital.

Gov. Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma responded to reports that some Democratic governors will no longer pay their National Governors Association (NGA) dues. 

Colorado Springs, Colo. – Incoming chair of the National Governors Association (NGA), Gov. Kevin Stitt, R-Okla., is "disappointed" that some Democratic governors might stop paying their dues to the bipartisan group. 

The Atlantic reported ahead of the NGA's summer meeting in Colorado Springs, Colo., that at least two Democrats, Govs. Tim Walz of Minnesota and Laura Kelly of Kansas, plan to stop paying their dues when asked to renew their membership this month over the NGA's response to President Donald Trump's second term. 

"We shouldn't be playing politics like they do in Washington, D.C.," Stitt told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview at the summer meeting. "But sometimes, if you're a governor running for president or a higher office, you make it political."

Kelly is chair of the Democratic Governors Association (DGA), the partisan gubernatorial arm that has been vocal in resisting the Trump administration. As Walz weighs a third gubernatorial run, the former vice presidential candidate has remained a leading critic of Trump's administration since losing the White House alongside Vice President Kamala Harris last year.

The Democratic discontent comes as Democratic Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado prepares to cede his chairmanship to Stitt, a Republican, at this weekend's summer meeting. Gov. Wes Moore, D-Md., is set to become vice chair.

"I would tell anybody, listen, do you want your leaders to take their ball and go home just because they get mad at something? That's not the way to solve problems," Stitt said, adding that he likes both Walz and Kelly. 

"Listen, this isn't the time to take our ball and go home. Let's sit down and debate what the best policies [are] going forward," Stitt added. 

The Oklahoma governor said it can be "frustrating" when Democrats are constantly targeting Trump, but as a business leader, he said there are plenty of instances in which governors can find common ground, including a reduction of the United States' more than $36 trillion in debt.

Ahead of the summer meeting, Eric Wohlschlegel, NGA communications director, emphasized the bipartisan nature of the NGA and told Fox News Digital the NGA's "mission hasn't changed."

According to The Atlantic report, Democratic members of the NGA complained the group "did not respond forcefully enough" when the Trump administration paused federal funding early this year, as Gov. Janet Mills of Maine clashed with Trump over biological men playing in women's sports and, more recently, when Trump authorized the National Guard to California to amid the anti-ICE protests. 

"Every public statement NGA issues reflects bipartisan consensus. So far this year, all but one statement has had that consensus, and when governors don't agree, we simply don't issue one. That's how we preserve our role as a bipartisan convener, a principle we won't compromise," Wohlschlegel explained. 

Thirteen Republican and seven Democratic leaders planned to attend the summer meeting, featuring discussions with Education Secretary Linda McMahon and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

A source familiar with the situation blamed the controversy on "Democratic infighting, unspoken campaign jockeying and a few anonymous voices looking to reshape a nonpartisan institution into a political one."

The source added that "no governors are on the record expressing discontent with the NGA. No allegations of misconduct, governance failure or mismanagement have been raised."

And without addressing the controversy directly, Conor Cahill, a spokesperson for Polis, told Fox News Digital the governor "has been honored" to lead the NGA and to "work across the aisle with governors on education, permitting reform, standing up to federal efforts to strip away gubernatorial authority around the National Guard and elevating the priorities of states."

He added that "during this polarizing time, bipartisan organizations are needed more than ever, and NGA must continue to demonstrate value to all governors and effectively communicate governors' opinions on various matters with the public and the federal government."

Abegail Cave, a spokesperson for Stitt, told Fox News Digital ahead of the NGA that "people seem to forget NGA is a bipartisan organization, not a political one."

Fox News Digital reached out to Walz and Kelly for comment but did not immediately receive a response.

“Who they came to see?” Beyoncé asks as she performs her 2023 single “My House” during the Cowboy Carter tour. For many, the answer has been Blue Ivy.

Blue Ivy Carter, the Grammy-winning artist's 13-year-old daughter, is more present than ever on stage, and fans are impressed by the growth from her first performance years ago to now.

Isabella Kerr, 15, has admired Beyoncé for years, but said she attended the Cowboy Carter tour specifically to experience Blue Ivy's moves in person.

“People are saying, “Oh, she's a mini Beyoncé,” but no, I think she's the first Blue. Everything about her when she's on stage is electrifying,” said Kerr.

The Cowboy Carter tour concludes Saturday in Las Vegas. The tour's 30 previous shows have had fans buzzing that Blue Ivy is well on her way to being a next generation powerhouse.

Blue first graced the stage at 11 years old during her mother's 2023 Renaissance tour, appearing during the legacy-celebrating anthems “My Power” and “Black Parade.” Supporters anticipated her performance at each stop.

She performed again during “Beyoncé Bowl,” the NFL Christmas Day Halftime Show that was just nominated for four Emmy Awards. She danced alongside the icon as she performed songs from the “Cowboy Carter” album for the first time.

“Even the difference between the Renaissance Tour and now, you can tell she's really grown in her confidence,” said fan and artist Olivia Ellis. “You can tell she has a different vibe about her.”

On the Cowboy Carter tour, she can almost be mistaken for one of Beyoncé's professional dancers. She is on stage for nearly every song and has a solo recreating her mother's choreography from her 2006 “Déjà-vu” music video, a nod to the undeniable similarities between the two.

Online videos of Blue display professionalism comparable to her mother's during the Cowboy Carter tour. During a rainy New Jersey stop, she brought out towels to dry her area of the stage before nailing her “America Has a Problem” choreography.

In another unexpected moment during a Chicago show, her earring got caught on Beyoncé's hair. Blue remained calm, removed the jewelry and motioned to the singer that it was safe in her hand as they both seamlessly continued.

“It's the family business,” said Kinitra D. Brooks, an academic and author of “The Lemonade Reader,” a collection that explores the nuances of Beyoncé's 2016 visual album, “Lemonade.” “She is literally studying under the best person doing it out there today. Why wouldn't she take advantage of that opportunity?”

In “Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé,” fans were given a behind-the-scenes look at the decision-making process the first time Blue was allowed to perform. Beyoncé expressed how nervous she was about her child being in front of thousands of people made her, revealing she initially said no.

“I did not think it was an appropriate place for an 11-year-old on a stadium stage,” she said in the documentary. “I made a deal with her, and I said, ‘If you practice and you show your commitment, I'll let you do one show.'” Blue Ivy fulfilled her end of the deal, and a fan base was formed: the “Ivy League.”

Kerr says Blue's accomplishments inspire her to work harder to achieve her own dreams. “She worked to be on stage, and look at her now. If I work to what I want to be, I can be killing it like her.”

At last month's Cowboy Carter Paris stop, members of the Beyhive and Ivy League finally got what they had been asking for — Blue Ivy merchandise. Shirts with the teen's face and the phrase “Déjà Blue” plastered on the front were available for purchase.

Prior to that, fans were creating their own custom pieces that highlighted Blue and Beyoncé's connection.

At the MetLife Stadium show, Ellis wore a custom corset top she painted, showcasing Blue Ivy and her 8-year-old sister, Rumi Carter, on stage with Beyoncé during “Protector,” a track from the “Cowboy Carter” album that Rumi is featured on.

“I thought that would just be a really fun moment to highlight on a corset,” she said. “It's just really cool to see her as a mom because we've all grown up with Beyoncé, and now it's like her show is kind of like a family affair.”

Blue Ivy's confidence and professionalism are not only a testament to her hard work, but Beyoncé's motherhood.

Mother-daughter duos around the globe filled stadium seats, excited to watch Beyoncé and her daughter display their strong bond for the world to see. In many cases, the mothers have been Beyoncé fans for years and are excited for their daughters to grow up with Blue Ivy, a high-flyer for their generation.

Tanazha Baylis took her now 11-year-old daughter, Aria Brown, to the Renaissance tour, where she did not miss a beat dancing along to Blue Ivy's “My Power” choreography.

Brown was so determined to attend the Cowboy Carter Tour that she started selling popular toys, such as slime and Squishmallows, and saving her money.

“She literally was like, ‘Mom, I don't know what you're going to do, but I have to go to this concert,'” said Baylis. “I just had to make it happen after that.”

Brown became a Beyoncé fan after participating in a dance recital with a theme centered around the superstar's career throughout the years. Baylis, who says she has always been a big fan, is happy to share these experiences with her daughter.

“It just showed her a cool mom and daughter, and it's just something that she can do as well. Beyoncé is a little older but, with seeing Blue there, it made it tangible for her.”

Although there is no solid answer for what the future holds for Blue Ivy, it is widely recognized that the possibilities are limitless.

“We couldn't imagine that Beyoncé would do all of these things that she could do. All we saw were people trying to put limitations on her,” said Brooks. “I think one of the things that Beyoncé wants us to do and what she wants for Blue is for us to not put those limitations on Blue.”

Rebecca De Mornay is not holding back when it comes to the reboot of one of her most iconic films.

The actress, 65, recently shared her reaction to the upcoming remake of the classic 1992 horror film, "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle," as she was excluded from the project. De Mornay claimed that nobody reached out to her about the reboot. 

"Nobody. I found out about it, and I kind of joked that I was quite perturbed," De Mornay told the New York Post. "It felt like a betrayal, like how dare you [have] somebody else be playing that part."

De Mornay delivered a chilling performance as the vengeful nanny Peyton Flanders in the thriller, alongside Annabella Sciorra, Julianne Moore, Matt McCoy, Ernie Hudson and more. 

Despite her bold comment, the actress isn't ruling out watching the new version.

"I'm actually kind of curious to see it, to see if they can live up to what we did," she added.

Her comments come at a time when Hollywood continues to create remakes of fan favorites, instead of producing original stories.

De Mornay continued to slam the Hollywood reboots, as she recently starred in the thriller "Saint Clare," opposite Bella Thorne and Ryan Phillippe. 

"New stories seem to be impossible for people to come up with. That's why I really like ‘Saint Clare.' It's new. I haven't seen anything like it before," she explained.

"There's a kind of laziness of falling [into] ‘Oh, well, that works. So let's just do that one again,' rather than coming up with a new story. So that kind of bugs me a little," she admitted.

A film remake that De Mornay did enjoy was "A Star is Born."

The beloved musical drama has seen multiple versions on the big screen since its original debut in 1937. In 1951, the project was created for television with Kathleen Crowley and Conrad Nagel in the lead roles. 

Just a few years later, the story returned with Judy Garland and James Mason in the 1954 classic. 

Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson offered their own spin in 1976, while Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper drew in a new generation with their 2018 rendition.

"We tend to think a movie is one cast. I guess it doesn't have to be, if it's a really good story, a good script," she said. "I guess, it doesn't have to, but I just wish that there was also more imagination with new scripts, because it feels like people are just falling back on what once were."

An enlightening analysis by pollsters John and Jim McLaughlin suggests that how voters view President Donald Trump six months into the job is largely influenced by which media they rely on.

If Fox and Newmax are the source, Trump is on a great run, scoring big wins. If it's CNN and MSNBC, he is sinking under the weight of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal.

In their opinion piece for Newsmax, the pollsters said that the media-fed political divide has stalled Trump's rise in polls.

They wrote, “despite legislative wins and economic improvements, Trump's approval ratings face a ceiling.”

They gave two reasons:

Take the direction of the nation as an example. They said that consumers of center-right media think things are fine, with 69% feeling that the country is headed in the right direction. Meanwhile, just 30% of those who consume liberal media agree.

In this week's White House Report Card, our graders show exactly what the McLaughlins have found.

Democratic pollster John Zogby, in grading the week an “F,” said the Epstein scandal is dragging Trump down. “Glug” was his rating on his “Drowning Meter.” Conservative grader Jed Babbin, giving the president an A-minus, said the affair rates a big “meh,” and said Trump is getting a lot done, especially in calling out those who have long tried to undermine him, notably former President Barack Obama.

Jed Babbin

Grade: A-

President Donald Trump got the best news he'd received since Hillary Rodham Clinton lost the 2016 election. As proven by the newly-declassified documents released by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, the whole Russia hoax was definitely the product of the Obama-Clinton gang.

The Russia hoax was created out of whole cloth, lies from beginning to end. It alleged that Trump was in league with Russian President Vladimir Putin and that by their collusion, Putin intended to tilt the election toward Trump. That was a huge lie. Putin wanted Hillary to be president (duh!) because she was vastly weaker than Trump and he could play her like a fiddle. There was no truth in the liberal hoax, nor in the congressional investigations and the special prosecutors.

It was all nonsense but had a profound slowing effect on Trump and his whole first term as president. What he needs now is like what Doc Holliday prescribed for Wyatt Earp as the good guys began to win in Tombstone. Trump needs a reckoning. It's a word you should look up. Its meaning may surprise you.

There was lots of other news. Ukraine arms shipments have resumed. Congress went home rather than deal with the Jeffrey Epstein files. (If Trump had been in them anywhere, Biden would have leaked the files joyously.) Meh. Too much blather and too little substance.

John Zogby

Grade: F

We began the week with a statement from the brother of a convicted pedophile saying that his brother (Jeffrey Epstein) ended his friendship with future President Donald Trump because he was a “crook.” And it doesn't get any better for Trump as the Epstein affair spreads.

He denied he sent a friendly birthday card to Epstein with a lewd cartoon, emphatically arguing that it could not have been him because he didn't doodle. But we got to see that the president is actually quite a good doodler and some were auctioned off for charity.

Then we saw a flurry of pictures of the future president all smiles with Epstein and his “associate,” convicted child trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. For her part, Maxwell was deposed by Trump's former attorney, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche this week.

This movie is getting tiresome and the president and his toadies in Congress have ensured that it will be shown every day through September.

The president had a photo op with the chair of the Federal Reserve this week, chastising him for the costs of renovations to taxpayers — including one made five years ago. Fed chairs are supposed to be independent and presidents are not supposed to confront them — even suggesting that they are going to not renew them for another term.

But that is tame compared with Trump's reaction to calls for release of all documents related to his relationship with Epstein. He also argued that his predecessor Barack Obama should be investigated for treason trying to pull off a coup against the newly elected Trump in 2017. He ordered the release of classified files dealing with the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, much to the dismay of the King family.

But that is not all. His recently passed budget cut resettlement programs for Afghan refugees who helped U.S. troops as translators and guides and now threatens them with deportation and possible death. It will also immediately reduce the numbers of Americans with health insurance by 11 million, threatening the quality of healthcare they receive and the shuttering of rural and smaller hospitals/urgent care facilities.

Not a good presidential week, not a good man, and his attempts to divert attention appear to be the flailing of a desperate man. His poll numbers continue to tank. On my “Drowning Meter,” he is at “Glug.” It takes “Glug, Glug, Glug” to sink to the bottom.

Jennifer Rogers-Etcheverry, Rogers' great-granddaughter, tells Fox News Digital that making movies ‘paid the bills' for the country boy at heart.

At the time of his death, '30s star Will Rogers was the highest-paid actor in Hollywood, but all he really wanted was to be a cowboy, according to his great-granddaughter, Jennifer Rogers-Etcheverry. 

"I think the Hollywood scene paid the bills," Rogers-Etcheverry, who lives in her great-grandfather's native Oklahoma, where he is known as "Oklahoma's favorite son," told Fox News Digital. 

"And he was contracted with Fox to make several movies, which he did not get to finish his contract, but he would crank them out just so he could go travel, go right on the ranch, go play polo, go do something."

Rogers owned a 186-acre ranch in the Pacific Palisades, California, that burned down in January in the Los Angeles fires.

"I don't think that his passion was being a movie star," Rogers-Etcheverry said. "His passion was out being with the people." 

Rogers was the highest-paid actor who had made more than 70 movies when he died in a plane crash in 1935 at 55 years old. But he was also an author and a newspaper columnist with more than 40 million readers a day, and he wrote six books. 

"I don't know when the man slept," Rogers-Etcheverry joked. "But he just, he wanted to see everything. He wanted to go, and making the movies paid the bills."

Despite being friendly with celebrities like Clark Gable and Walt Disney and hobnobbing with presidents and kings and queens, Rogers-Etcheverry says he was a "common man."

"And he never forgot where he came from in Oklahoma," she said. "He never forgot being a cowboy. That's all he ever wanted to be was a cowboy. And I think he just stuck to his roots. And going from just being a cowboy on a ranch in Oologah, Oklahoma, to the No. 1 box office star … in Hollywood and just, he never got that attitude or that arrogance."

"He never forgot where he came from in Oklahoma. He never forgot being a cowboy."

She said her grandfather always told her that when Rogers came back to his ranch, "he was Dad, he was not Will Rogers. And he just shut it all off and was a dad. He was just a nice, good ‘ol boy." 

Rogers got his start in the entertainment business by trick-roping in a Wild West show in Texas, and then he was hired for the Ziegfeld Follies in New York. 

"As he said, he entertained the audience by trick-roping while the girls changed from nothing into nothing, and he was told not to say a word," she said.

She said one time, when he messed up a trick that he joked, "'Hey guys, sorry I got all my feet through but one,' and the audience laughed, and he immediately fueled off that laughter."

Rogers-Etcheverry said it was "at that moment where he knew he could entertain people."

Soon after, he got a speaking role, quoting what he'd read in the newspapers, making fun of the president of the United States and more until celebrities started coming to his show, which were always sold out, she said. 

"And it just led from there," Rogers-Etcheverry said. "And then he eventually got contracted into the movies and moved to California."

Aside from starring in dozens of silent films and talkies, like "A Connecticut Yankee" with Maureen O'Sullivan and "Steamboat Round the Bend," Rogers was also an avid flying enthusiast who was friends with aviator Charles Lindbergh.

After the infamous Lindbergh baby kidnapping and murder, Rogers invited the aviator's family to stay at his California ranch so they could have some privacy.

"Because, of course, the press was all over it," Rogers-Etcheverry explained. "So, he kind of took them in and kept them there. And they did stay there. And I don't know exactly how long they stayed there, but they did spend quite a bit of time there when all that was happening."

Rogers died in a plane crash in Alaska while surveying mail routes with Oklahoma aviator Wiley Post in August 1935, and it "shut down not only the United States, it shut down the world," Rogers-Etcheverry said. 

"At the time of his death, he was not only the most famous person in America, he truly was the most famous man in the world. Everyone knew who he was, and he had visited every country. He was the unofficial humanitarian for the United States."

When she got involved in the family business, keeping Rogers' memory alive, Rogers-Etcheverry said that people who were older told her they remembered being children when Rogers died.

"And they said to me, ‘That's the only time I've ever seen my dad cry or my mom cry.' They were devastated. And I think it was because he was a man that just, he made you feel good. He brought people together in a way that no one has ever been able to do since."

Rogers' widow, Betty, donated his ranch and land to the state in 1944, and it became Will Rogers State Historic Park, which still attracts celebrities to this day, Rogers-Etcheverry said.

She said she took over the role of family representative for Rogers years ago.

"I want to keep his legacy alive. I have two children and two grandchildren, and if it wasn't for me, they would have no idea who Will Rogers is," she said. 

"You know, in Oklahoma it's a little bit easier. He's Oklahoma's favorite son, and there's not anything back here that isn't named after him. But you get outside the state, it's a little more challenging."

Fox News senior national correspondent Rich Edson reports on the newly declassified Russiagate documents, Democrats' dismissal of the ‘historic scandal' and more on ‘Special Report.'

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard declassified a slew of documents this month, revealing that Obama administration officials "manufactured" intelligence to push the Trump-Russia collusion narrative.

Here's a look at the newly declassified records:

Documents revealed that in the months leading up to the November 2016 election, the intelligence community consistently assessed that Russia was "probably not trying … to influence the election by using cyber means."

One instance was on Dec. 7, 2016, weeks after the election. Then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper's talking points stated, "Foreign adversaries did not use cyberattacks on election infrastructure to alter the U.S. presidential election outcome."

Fox News Digital obtained a declassified copy of the Presidential Daily Brief, which was prepared by the Department of Homeland Security, with reporting from the CIA, Defense Intelligence Agency, FBI, National Security Agency, Department of Homeland Security, State Department and open sources, for Obama, dated Dec. 8, 2016.

"We assess that Russian and criminal actors did not impact recent U.S. election results by conducting malicious cyber activities against election infrastructure," the Presidential Daily Brief stated. "Russian Government-affiliated actors most likely compromised an Illinois voter registration database and unsuccessfully attempted the same in other states."

But the brief stated that it was "highly unlikely" the effort "would have resulted in altering any state's official vote result."

"Criminal activity also failed to reach the scale and sophistication necessary to change election outcomes," it stated. 

The brief noted that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence assessed that any Russian activities "probably were intended to cause psychological effects, such as undermining the credibility of the election process and candidates."

The brief stated that cyber criminals "tried to steal data and to interrupt election processes by targeting election infrastructure, but these actions did not achieve a notable disruptive effect."

Fox News Digital obtained declassified, but redacted, communications from the FBI in the Presidential Daily Brief, stating that it "should not go forward until the FBI" had shared its "concerns."

Those communications revealed that the FBI drafted a "dissent" to the original Presidential Daily Brief.

The communications revealed that the brief was expected to be published Dec. 9, 2016, the following day, but later communications revealed the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, "based on some new guidance," decided to "push back publication" of the Presidential Daily Brief. 

"It will not run tomorrow and is not likely to run until next week," wrote the deputy director of the Presidential Daily Brief at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, whose name is redacted. 

The following day, Dec. 9, 2016, a meeting convened in the White House Situation Room, with the subject line starting: "Summary of Conclusions for PC Meeting on a Sensitive Topic (REDACTED.)"

The meeting included top officials in the National Security Council, Clapper, then-CIA Director John Brennan, then-National Security Advisor Susan Rice, then-Secretary of State John Kerry, then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch, then-Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, among others, to discuss Russia.

The declassified meeting record, obtained by Fox News Digital, revealed that principals "agreed to recommend sanctioning of certain members of the Russian military intelligence and foreign intelligence chains of command responsible for cyber operations as a response to cyber activity that attempted to influence or interfere with U.S. elections, if such activity meets the requirements" from an executive order that demanded the blocking of property belonging to people engaged in cyber activities.

After the meeting, according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Clapper's executive assistant emailed intelligence community leaders tasking them to create a new intelligence community assessment "per the president's request" that detailed the "tools Moscow used and actions it took to influence the 2016 election."

"ODNI will lead this effort with participation from CIA, FBI, NSA, and DHS," the record states.

Later, Obama officials "leaked false statements to media outlets" claiming that "Russia has attempted through cyber means to interfere in, if not actively influence, the outcome of an election."

By Jan. 6, 2017, a new Intelligence Community Assessment was released that, according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, "directly contradicted the IC assessments that were made throughout the previous six months." 

Intelligence officials told Fox News Digital that the ICA was "politicized" because it "suppressed intelligence from before and after the election showing Russia lacked intent and capability to hack the 2016 election." 

Officials also said it deceived the American public "by claiming the IC made no assessment on the ‘impact' of Russian activities," when the intelligence community "did, in fact, assess for impact." 

"The unpublished December PDB stated clearly that Russia ‘did not impact' the election through cyber hacks on the election," an official told Fox News Digital.

The official also said the ICA had assessed that "Russia was responsible for leaking data from the DNC and DCCC," while "failing to mention that FBI and NSA previously expressed low confidence in this attribution." 

Officials said the intelligence was "politicized" and then "used as the basis for countless smears seeking to delegitimize President Trump's victory, the years-long Mueller investigation, two Congressional impeachments, high level officials being investigated, arrested, and thrown in jail, heightened US-Russia tensions, and more."

A report prepared by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in 2020 said the intelligence community did not have any direct information that Russian President Vladimir Putin wanted to help elect Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election, but, at the "unusual" direction of then-President Barack Obama, published "potentially biased" or "implausible" intelligence suggesting otherwise.

The report, based on an investigation launched by former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., was dated Sept. 18, 2020. At the time of the publication of the report, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., was the chairman of the committee.

The report has never before been released to the public and instead has remained highly classified within the intelligence community.

Fox News Digital obtained the "fully-sourced limited-access investigation report that was drafted and stored in a limited-access vault at CIA Headquarters." The report includes some redactions.

BRENNAN DIRECTED PUBLICATION OF 'IMPLAUSIBLE' REPORTS CLAIMING PUTIN PREFERRED TRUMP IN 2016, HOUSE FOUND

The committee focused on the creation of the Intelligence Community Assessment of 2017, in which then-CIA Director John Brennan pushed for the inclusion of the now-discredited anti-Trump dossier despite knowing it was based largely on "internet rumor," as Fox News Digital previously reported.

According to the report, the ICA was a "high-profile product ordered by the President, directed by senior IC agency heads, and created by just five CIA analysts, using one principal drafter."

"Production of the ICA was subject to unusual directives from the President and senior political appointees, and particularly DCIA," the report states. "The draft was not properly coordinated within CIA or the IC, ensuring it would be published without significant challenges to its conclusions."

The committee found that the five CIA analysts and drafter "rushed" the ICA's production "in order to publish two weeks before President-elect Trump was sworn-in."

"Hurried coordination and limited access to the draft reduced opportunities for the IC to discover misquoting of sources and other tradecraft concerns," the report states.

The report states that Brennan "ordered the post-election publication of 15 reports containing previously collected but unpublished intelligence, three of which were substandard — containing information that was unclear, of uncertain origin, potentially biased, or implausible — and those became foundational sources for the ICA judgements that Putin preferred Trump over Clinton."

"The ICA misrepresented these reports as reliable, without mentioning their significant underlying flaws," the committee found.

"One scant, unclear, and unverifiable fragment of a sentence from one of the substandard reports constitutes the only classified information cited to suggest Putin ‘aspired' to help Trump win," the report states, adding that the ICA "ignored or selectively quoted reliable intelligence reports that challenged — and in some cases undermined — judgments that Putin sought to elect Trump."

The report also states that the ICA "failed to consider plausible alternative explanations of Putin's intentions indicated by reliable intelligence and observed Russian actions."

The committee also found that two senior CIA officers warned Brennan that "we don't have direct information that Putin wanted to get Trump elected."

Despite those warnings, the Obama administration moved to publish the ICA.

The ICA "did not cite any report where Putin directly indicated helping Trump win was the objective."

The ICA, according to the report, excluded "significant intelligence" and "ignored or selectively quoted" reliable intelligence in an effort to push the Russia narrative.

The report also includes intelligence from a longtime Putin confidant who explained to investigators that "Putin told him he did not care who won the election," and that Putin "had often outlined the weaknesses of both major candidates."

The report also states that the ICA omitted context showing that the claim that Putin preferred Trump was "implausible —if not ridiculous."

The committee also found that the ICA suppressed intelligence that showed that Russia was actually planning for a Hillary Clinton victory because "they knew where (she) stood" and believed Russia "could work with her."

The committee also noted that the ICA "did not address why Putin chose not to leak more discrediting material on Clinton, even as polls tightened in the final weeks of the election."

The committee also found that the ICA suppressed intelligence showing that Putin was "not only demonstrating a clear lack of concern for Trump's election fate," but also indicated "that he preferred to see Secretary Clinton elected, knowing she would be a more vulnerable President."

One section of the declassified House Intelligence Committee report states that the material in Putin's possession included Russian intelligence on Democratic National Committee information allegedly showing that senior Democratic leaders found Clinton's health to be "extraordinarily alarming." 

"As of September 2016, the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service had DNC information that President Obama and Party leaders found the state of Secretary Clinton's health to be ‘extraordinarily alarming,' and felt it could have ‘serious negative impact' on her election prospects," the report states. "Her health information was being kept in ‘strictest secrecy' and even close advisors were not being fully informed." 

The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service also allegedly had DNC communications that showed that "Clinton was suffering from ‘intensified psycho-emotional problems, including uncontrolled fits of anger, aggression, and cheerfulness.'"

"Clinton was placed on a daily regimen of ‘heavy tranquilizers' and while afraid of losing, she remained ‘obsessed with a thirst for power,'" the report states.

The Russians also allegedly had information that Clinton "suffered from ‘Type 2 diabetes, Ischemic heart disease, deep vein thrombosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.'"

HILLARY CLINTON AIDE DISMISSES TULSI GABBARD'S CLAIMS AS 'RIDICULOUS'

The Russians also allegedly possessed a "campaign email discussing a plan approved by Secretary Clinton to link Putin and Russian hackers to candidate Trump in order to ‘distract the American public' from the Clinton email server scandal." 

Gabbard, during the White House press briefing Wednesday, said there were "high-level DNC emails that detailed evidence of Hillary's, quote, psycho-emotional problems, uncontrolled fits of anger, aggression and cheerfulness, and that then-Secretary Clinton was allegedly on a daily regimen of heavy tranquilizers."

A tranquilizer is a drug used to reduce mental disturbance, such as anxiety and tension. Tranquilizers are typically prescribed to individuals suffering from anxiety, sleep disturbances and related conditions affecting their mental and physical health. 

A Clinton aide dismissed the claims as "ridiculous." 

Neither Clinton nor Obama responded to Fox News Digital's requests for comment.

Chinese financiers and operators are behind a surge of illegal marijuana grow operations that have sprung up across Maine, according to Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME).

Collins has led the charge to stand up a joint federal, state, and local operation to take down the hundreds of confirmed grow houses in her backyard. Since 2022, her small New England home state has had 270 confirmed illegal marijuana grow operations uncovered by authorities, but Collins is particularly concerned with who is behind them.

“It is a marijuana operation, illegally operated by a transnational Chinese criminal organization, and likely with the knowledge of the Chinese Communist Party,” Collins told the Washington Examiner. “This was very disturbing.”

Collins has finally started to see meaningful progress made in the months since President Donald Trump took office, but getting here has been a yearslong effort that Collins and others involved shared the details of.

Until recently, rural Central Maine was a hub for the grow houses, and Maine itself was a national leader for states affected by this type of crime.

Unlike in other leading states for illegal marijuana grow operations, such as California and Oklahoma, where Latin criminal organizations known as cartels were behind the operations, that was not the case in Maine. Chinese workers staffed these and, as investigations would reveal, they were run and financed by Chinese businessmen, according to Collins and the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Trouble first appeared on Collins's radar in June 2022, when she was contacted by a constituent about suspicious activity at a nearby home. Collins began working with the DEA around that time to get federal law enforcement involved.

Collins said that Sheriff Dale Lancaster of Somerset County also received a high volume of public reports of heavy traffic going in and out of homes in the countryside. Lancaster could not be reached for comment.

Local authorities began sharing their observations: homes with electric bills higher than a motel's, unusual smells around certain houses, lots of Chinese people coming and going all at once every few weeks in a predominantly white area, according to Richard LaBelle, town manager for Norridgewock, Maine's 3,300 residents.

“They purchased these homes. Some of them were cash. Some of them they had mortgages on, and they were coming in and not seeking any permits or anything like that. They were just retrofitting these homes,” LaBelle said.

“You were seeing commercial electricity drops brought into the homes. They were covering windows, doors, and walls with insulation,” LaBelle said. “They were really setting up these makeshift grows. Some folks were distributing. Some folks were cultivating.… some of these buildings were primarily housing.”

Maine is one of the few states that allows residents to grow marijuana legally. Residents over 21 may grow up to six mature plants, but anyone who grows it for medical use is exempt from those caps.

The state's caregiver program for growing marijuana allows residents to grow large amounts of marijuana legally. It also gave illegal growers some cover since, from an outsider's perspective, the grow could be for medical purposes.

But this was different and not for medical reasons, according to Paul Spera, special agent in charge at the DEA.

“Maine marijuana goes to Massachusetts and New York — lots of different organizations. Some of it stays in Maine, being sold to undercut the legitimate market. Legal stuff has to be taxed, but black market stuff doesn't,” Spera said in a phone call.

Houses that were converted into grow houses are covered in black mold inside, according to all three officials. It destroyed the homes past repair from future habitation and took what was once a perfectly good home off the real estate market, particularly at a time when Maine has an affordable housing shortage, Collins said.

“I personally think Maine made a mistake in legalizing cannabis, but at least it did so with a regulatory framework that is intended to regulate the amount of THC, the amount of pesticides, the type of herbicides … those regulations, obviously, are not followed at all by these illegal grow houses,” Collins said.

LaBelle described the difficulty of addressing the problem when it was out of sight. To complicate matters further, the county sheriff's department was responsible for several communities across a 300-mile area and was spread thin.

In August 2023, Collins and other Maine lawmakers took action and sent then-U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland a letter calling on the Justice Department to shut down what had been confirmed to be illegally run marijuana grow operations.

Collins wanted federal assistance because local and state law enforcement could not adequately address the problem. When the state intervened, growers were fined for violating state law. Sometimes, the growers declared their status as medical growers to avoid getting into trouble or would shut down operations and take everything out of the house overnight, leaving it beyond repair.

Conversations with the DEA continued as the DOJ remained quiet, prompting Collins to send additional letters to Garland and then-U.S. Attorney for the District of Maine Darcie McElwee from 2023 into early 2024. The DOJ promised to look into it in April 2024.

Collins put Garland on the spot during a public Senate hearing that same month and asked what the Biden administration was doing about it.

“This is a really serious threat to public health and to our national security,” Collins said in a phone call.

The DEA has been inside 50 to 100 grow houses in Maine since 2023, according to Spera, and helped local and state police as they responded and began investigations into the bigger picture of what was going on.

For the federal agents, the goal has been dismantling organizations, not going after individuals. That also means federal prosecutors and support from the DOJ, which Collins said she was still not seeing.

In June 2024, then-FBI Director Christopher Wray confirmed to Collins what she had suspected: “We are starting to see, as we unpack this more, more ties of a lot of these growing operations and Chinese organized crime.”

Despite Collins' best efforts, the DOJ had not done much, if anything, to address the situation, she said, until the Trump administration took office in January.

“It was very frustrating to me in the previous administration that I could not secure the kind of help that Maine needed — that Maine sheriffs and local law enforcement needed — to close down what are estimated to be, at that time, some 200 grow houses in my state,” Collins said. “We had a hard time getting prosecutions, getting investigations, and just getting the resources.”

Earlier this year, FBI Director Kash Patel and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem both committed to working with Maine to shut down the grow operations.

In early July, the DOJ charged seven Chinese nationals in a multi-million dollar conspiracy to cultivate and distribute marijuana across the New England region by using grow houses concealed inside single-family properties in Maine and Massachusetts. Federal prosecutors alleged that the Chinese nationals were smuggled into the United States to work in the grow houses without access to their passports until they repaid the smugglers who got them into the country.

“We're seeing a big, a big difference in how seriously the federal government is taking this problem,” Collins said.

A DOJ official added in an email to the Washington Examiner that illegal grow houses now appear to number less than 50 statewide.

The Maine Department of Administrative and Financial Services Office of Cannabis Policy did not respond to requests for comment.

Steve Cohen, who is executive producing the new documentary "Billy Joel: And So it Goes," said that his fingers are crossed that the 76-year-old will perform again after his brain disorder diagnosis. 

Billy Joel said he was "devastated" when second wife Christie Brinkley left him during their nine-year marriage that ended in divorce in 1994. 

"I realized love is not concrete," the "Uptown Girl" singer told the producers in the second part of his documentary "Billy Joel: And So it Goes." He added, "You know, you feel like it is, but there are things eating away at it, and in the end it all catches up. And it's hard. And I was so devastated." 

An obviously emotional Brinkley said she had tried.

"I wanted it to work. I knew how lucky I was, having music and all that, but it just didn't work," she explained. 

The former couple met in 1983 in St. Barts. They married in 1985 and soon had their only daughter, Alexa Ray Joel.  

"Our relationship went from lots of fun and really totally enjoying each other to his work consuming him, and if I did go on the road, I wasn't seeing him because the unwind period after the show was going on so late into the night, and it's like ‘What am I even doing here?'" Brinkley said. "And I just got like ‘I don't even know what to do, but I can't be lonely just me and Alexa in this big old house that was supposed to be so full of life and love and music and laughter and all that.' Things were starting to deteriorate."

Joel said it was a hard time for him because they were newly married and had a young daughter, but he was on the road a lot of the time.

"I realized love is not concrete. You know, you feel like it is, but there are things eating away at it, and in the end it all catches up. And it's hard. And I was so devastated."

"I was in a relationship with someone who I cared deeply about, but I was not able to be at home," he said. "I was not able to be with my family. It was a very sad time for me."

The 76-year-old said he thinks his daughter knew he and Brinkley were going to split up.

"And for a child that's a very traumatic thing," he said.

Joel's own parents divorced when he was 8 years old, around the same age as Alexa when he and Brinkley divorced in 1994, but Joel's father left after the divorce, and he didn't see him again until he was in his 20s.

"She needed to know I'd always be there," the "Piano Man" singer said of his own daughter, now 39 years old.

"I don't think it's a secret that his drinking got pretty bad, and he couldn't really remember what he did when he was drinking, so he didn't really know how he could hurt people," Brinkley added. 

She said she would pretend to be asleep when he came into their bedroom drunk, "‘cause I didn't want to see him in that condition."

Holding back tears, Christie Brinkley said, "One night, we had an argument and I said, ‘I really can't take this anymore, and I'm just going to take Alexa back up to New York and leave, and he said, ‘Yeah, fine, go.'" (Vinnie Zuffanate/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images)

Holding back tears, she added, "One night, we had an argument and I said, ‘I really can't take this anymore, and I'm just going to take Alexa back up to New York and leave, and he said, ‘Yeah, fine, go.'" 

"True love isn't always floating on clouds and ecstasy," Joel told the producers over the lyrics of "And So it Goes." 

"A lot of it's pain." 

Joel would go on to marry celebrity chef Katie Lee in 2004. They divorced five years later, and he married his current wife, Alexis Roderick, in 2015. They share two daughters. Before his marriage to Brinkley, Joel was married to Elizabeth Small from 1973 until 1983.

SAN DIEGO (AP) — The Grid has overtaken Comic-Con.

Disney unveiled details about “Tron: Ares,” which stars Jared Leto, Jeff Bridges and Greta Lee at an evening presentation in Comic-Con's famed Hall H. It will be the third feature film in the “Tron” franchise that kicked off with the hit 1982 film and had a 2010 sequel, “Tron: Legacy.”

The original starred Bridges as a computer hacker who gets trapped in a digital world. The Oscar-winner drew the biggest applause when introduced during the panel.

“Tron: Ares” sees the Grid breaking through the real world.

The other major presentations Friday included updates on the final season of “Outlander” and its prequel series “Outlander: Blood of My Blood,” “Alien: Earth” and “Predator: Badlands.”

An estimated 135,000 people from around the globe are expected to attend Comic-Con 2025, which runs through Sunday in downtown San Diego.

Fans on opening day got a preview of “Five Nights at Freddy's 2,” “The Toxic Avenger,” and a joke-filled session with comedians Gabriel “Fluffy” Iglesias and Jo Koy.

The Predator is on the hunt again.

Director Dan Trachtenberg brought new footage from “Predator: Badlands” to Comic-Con's Hall H, showing off an unfinished cut of the movie's first 15 minutes and bringing the film's stars.

The massive convention hall erupted in cheers at clip, which featured a family of Predators fighting. The early scenes set the stakes for the movie, which is about a Predator sent on its first hunt on an unforgiving planet.




Trachtenberg said one inspiration behind the movie was the realization that “The Predator never wins.” He wanted to see what that would look like but didn't want to make a slasher film, he said.

Elle Fanning, who plays a cyborg who spends much of the film strapped to the young Predator's back, said her first foray into sci-fi presented many new acting challenges.

“I was really strapped to his back for hours and hours,” she said.

While that was physically challenging, she said, at least she wasn't acting across from a tennis ball, which is often used to give actors a sense of the scale of computer-generated characters.

“Badlands” changed the Predator costume from previous iterations, keeping everything as a tangible costume except for the face. That allowed her to act opposite Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi, which Trachtenberg said allowed for more emotional range from the Predator.

The movie takes place on a deadly planet where Trachtenberg said all the plants and animals are trying to kill the Predator. Moderator Kevin Smith (yes, the “Clerks' director) likened it to “essentially Australia in space.”

Trachtenberg also showed a clip that will be added to the animated “Killer of Killers” movie, which will become a new end credits scene. It shows an expansive prison of cryogenically frozen beings, three of whom are the human protagonists — all killers of Predators — from the first two “Predator” movies and “Prey.”

The new scene was added to the film, which streams on Hulu Friday night.

“Predator: Badlands” arrives in theaters Nov. 7.

It won't be long before audiences get to see the Xenomorph in “Alien: Earth.” But there are some new alien life forms creator Noah Hawley will introduce in the upcoming FX series.

Hawley and the cast screened the first episode for a packed Hall H at Comic-Con to cheers and a few scared noises when a new creepy-crawly alien creature claimed its first victim.

Hawley, who created the “Fargo” series, said showing audiences new creatures is central to recapturing the feel of the original “Alien” movie.

One of the things he's good at is “understanding what the original movie made me feel and why and trying to create it anew,” he said. 

Part of the power of Ridley Scott's “Alien” is “the discovery of the life cycle of this creature,” Hawley said. He said he was trying to capture the “genetic revulsion of ‘Alien' for the first time.”

The show stars Sydney Chandler as a new life-form created when the consciousness of a young girl is transferred into an adult body with superhuman strength and speed.

Asked how she reacted to seeing the Xenomorph on set for the first time, Chandler said, “I almost peed. I became a kid again.

“A xenomorph was in my night terrors as a kid.”

The first episode introduces the doomed crew of the USS Maginot and the aftermath its crash-landing in an Earth city after some of its specimens break free.

Set in 2120, it unspools two years before the events of “Alien.” The early moments establish the world as a place controlled by massive corporations and where humans, cyborgs and synthetic humans coexist.

Babou Ceesay plays a cyborg whose mission is to protect the alien species at all costs. Humanlike, he has an arm that was likened Friday to a Swiss Army knife. 

But Ceesay said his character has been away from Earth for more than 60 years and isn't as advanced as he seems: “He's coming back to a planet where he's essentially an iPhone 1 in an iPhone 20 world.”

The show premieres Aug. 12 on FX.

The topic of the ultimate matchup between Aliens versus Predators came up during both sessions Friday. The matchup of the two fearsome aliens has been the subject of comic books, video games and a 2004 movie.

Hawley didn't spill any news about reboots.

Trachtenberg, who Smith described as the keeper of the Predator franchise now, had a simple answer: “Wouldn't it be cool?”

SAN DIEGO (AP) — The Grid took over Comic-Con on Friday, bringing the stars of the new “Tron: Ares” films to unveil footage and reveal the story behind the franchise's third movie.

The film stars Jared Leto, Jeff Bridges, Greta Lee and Jodie Turner-Smith as the story brings the virtual environment of the Grid, complete with light cylces, into the real world.

Disney showed off several minutes of footage, including a light cycle chase scene in the real world and another in the red-hued Grid. Propelling the onscreen action is a propulsive Nine Inch Nails soundtrack.

“It's fun to see it on the big screen for the first time,” said director Joachim Rønning.

Disney turned the Hall H panel into a spectacle, with red lasers filling the room and characters in suits with red lights entering the massive hall.

Asked what excited her about joining the “Tron” franchise, Lee responded: “I just wanted to ride a light cycle.”

Leto spoke affectionately about the original saying: “This movie just grabbed a hold of me and took me to a place that I'd never been before. It kind of rattled my imagination and it kind of showed me what was possible in the world.”

He praised Bridges and Steven Lisberger, who created “Tron” and directed the 1982 original. Lisberger attended Friday's panel and laid out his case for why the franchise remains relevant. 

“My feeling about ‘Tron' is that the most important thing is we kick this technology around artistically before it kicks us around,” Lisberger said. 




“I am weary about hearing all the grim news about the future,” he said, and the way he thinks it can be avoided is to “inspire young people what can be done with this technology.”

Friday's panel ended with the premiere of the music video for “As Alive as You Need Me to Be,” the first Nine Inch Nails song from the soundtrack.

“Tron” has never been in the top tier of sci-fi franchises. The original 1982 film starring Bridges as Kevin Flynn, a man sucked into a computer vortex known as the Grid, was admired for its ground-breaking concept and effects, and was a modest hit with moderately good reviews.

Perhaps more importantly, it won a cult following and has been maintained enough in cultural memory to remain a valuable property for Disney.

The 2010 film “Tron: Legacy,” starring Bridges and Garrett Hedlund, made more than $400 million globally. A TV show that followed, “Tron: Uprising,” lasted just one season.

Rønning has helmed other Disney franchise films: 2017's “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales” and 2019's “Maleficent: Mistress of Evil.” The Norweigan director said he was interested because he dreamed about making a sci-fi film and enjoyed the twist of “Ares” bringing the Grid into the real world.

Leto and Bridges are both Oscar winners, and Rønning is an Oscar nominee. ___

            Fleeing Washington's oppressive humidity and nonstop questions over heated controversies, President Donald Trump is once again taking weekend refuge at his golf clubs — this time more than 3,000 miles away in Scotland.
    


            While the White House has called his five-day trip a “working visit,” it's fairly light on the formal itinerary. Trump is poised to hold trade talks Sunday with the chief of the European Union and is scheduled to meet with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Monday.
    


            But he's expected to spend most of his trip out of public view at two of his golf resorts – Trump Turnberry in the west and Trump International about 200 miles away in the north, near his mother's ancestral homeland.
    


            “We have a lot of things in Scotland,” Trump said as he left the White House on Friday, noting his familial ties to the land. “I have a lot of love.”
    


            Even as protesters demonstrated against Trump here on Saturday, the four nights in temperate Scotland come as a summertime respite after six months back in office. His administration is engulfed in a deepening political crisis over its handling of disclosures around the case of Jeffrey Epstein, accused sex trafficker and former friend of the president's.
    


            Nearly every time Trump has spoken with reporters in recent weeks, he's been pressed with new questions about the Epstein scandal, many of which are fueled by deep suspicions that he and his followers have been stirring for years. New revelations about his personal ties to the disgraced financier have kept the matter alive.
    


            The Scotland trip schedule allows Trump to focus instead on areas where he's more comfortable: trade deals, his family businesses and golf. Trump often speaks fondly of his ties to Scotland, the birthplace of his late mother, though the feeling has been far from mutual — his development of luxury golf resorts over the last two decades has ignited objections from many local residents.
    


            “What he did in the many estates in Aberdeenshire, and how he bullied and intimidated the local people there, he's not a nice person,” said Fiona McPherson, who joined a demonstration Saturday. “America was our ally for so long. We relied on America so much. Now, it's an embarrassment.”
    


            The centerpiece of this trip is a dedication and ribbon-cutting ceremony on Tuesday for a new 18-hole golf course in Aberdeenshire on the windswept coast of the North Sea. It's named the MacLeod Course in honor of Trump's mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, who was born in 1912 outside of Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis.
    


            She left for New York in 1930 at the age of 18, emigrating to the United States following World War I. She married Fred C. Trump, the son of German immigrants, in 1936 and died in 2000. A black and white photograph of her sits prominently behind the president's desk in the Oval Office.
    


            Authorities in Scotland have spent weeks preparing for Trump's arrival. Assistant Chief Constable Emma Bond told reporters the security operation would be the largest the country has mounted since the death of Queen Elizabeth II in 2022, including local officers, national security divisions and special constables.
    


            The overall tone toward Trump has been markedly less fond, however. The Friday edition of The National, a liberal-leaning newspaper that supports Scottish independence, rolled out a not-so-welcoming message to Trump with a blaring and bold front-page headline: “Convicted US Felon to Arrive in Scotland.”
    


            A group called Stop Trump Scotland, a coalition of demonstrators, organized protests at Aberdeen and outside the US consulate in Edinburgh as part of a “Festival of Resistance.” A few hundred people turned out Saturday to raise their voices against the visiting American president, waving colorful signs and chanting slogans.
    


            As he arrived in Scotland on Friday night, Trump made no mention of the disapproval awaiting him. He said he eagerly anticipated meeting left-leaning Scottish First Minister John Swinney, who has been an outspoken critic and last year endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris.
    


            “He's a good man,” Trump told reporters. “I look forward to meeting him.”
    


            With trade talks intensifying, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen announced Friday that she planned to meet with Trump in Scotland on Sunday “to discuss transatlantic trade relations and how we can keep them strong.”
    


            Trump said earlier there was a “50-50” chance he would reach a trade deal with the EU, adding as he departed for Scotland that his administration was “working very diligently” with Europe.
    


            Trump's meeting with von der Leyen — whom he has not yet hosted at the White House — comes as the EU rushes to clinch a trade deal with its largest trading partner that would stave off a threatened 30% tariff set to take effect August 1.
    


            In the past, Trump has adopted a hostile attitude toward the European Union, claiming it was formed to “screw” the United States. He has maintained a somewhat distant relationship with von der Leyen, who was close to former President Joe Biden, adding another complexity to their Sunday meeting.
    


            “That would be, actually, the biggest deal of them all if we make it,” Trump said of a potential agreement with the European Union after he landed in Scotland Friday.
    


            It's the first visit Trump has made to the country since 2023, when he broke ground on the golf course dedicated to his mother. But returning this weekend as the sitting American president has roused critics, including Green Party leader and member of parliament, Patrick Harvie.
    


            “Donald Trump is a convicted criminal and political extremist,” Harvie told reporters in Scotland this week. “There can be no excuses for trying to cozy up to his increasingly fascist political agenda.”
    


            While golf is the primary item on Trump's weekend schedule, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt described the trip as “a working visit that will include a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Starmer to refine the historic US-UK trade deal.”
    


            Starmer has worked to develop a warm relationship with Trump, visiting him at the White House in February and holding conversations since then on trade, military support for Ukraine and other global challenges. It's paid off, at least somewhat — Starmer is one of a handful of country leaders who have secured a trade deal with Trump.
    


            The deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, officials said, is expected to be among the topics discussed, but British officials have generally been working to lower expectations for the Monday meeting, suggesting it is a prelude to an official state visit in September. Trump is set to return to the United Kingdom at the invitation of King Charles III for a ceremonial welcome at Windsor Castle. He was hosted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2019 at Buckingham Palace.
    


            “This is really special,” Starmer said in February when he extended the invitation to Trump in a letter from the King. “This has never happened before, this is unprecedented.”
    


            The Scotland visit is the fifth international trip Trump has taken since returning to office. He briefly visited Rome for Pope Francis' funeral in April, toured the Middle East in May, met with G7 leaders in Canada and attended a NATO summit in the Hague in June.
    


            “President Trump's affinity for Scotland is real, regardless of what people think of his politics,” Anas Sarwar, the Labour Party leader in Scotland wrote in an April essay in The Times of London. “His family's investments in Ayrshire and Aberdeenshire are real and significant.”
    


            This is the first trip overseas that is built nearly entirely around a weekend of golf. He hit the course Saturday morning, playing with the US Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Warren Stephens, along with the ambassador's son, the White House said. The president's sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., are accompanying him for the weekend.
    


            For a president who repeatedly railed against his predecessors for golfing – and called last week on the Republican Senate to cancel its annual August recess and “long weekends” to keep working on his agenda – Trump hits the links without apology, no matter the season.
    


            From his regular winter visits to two of his courses in Florida to his spring and summer trips to his clubs in Virginia and New Jersey, seldom does a weekend go by that Trump doesn't spend time at one of his golf courses or resorts.
    


            On this trip, Trump is scheduled to spend three nights at Trump Turnberry, a luxury resort that he has owned since 2014 on the west coast, overlooking the Irish Sea.
    


            “It's the best resort in the world, I think,” Trump boasted of his club.
    


            He will also spend one night at his course in Aberdeenshire, on the northern coast, and take part in the only public event expected on his itinerary: a dedication ceremony for a second 18-hole course.
    


            The president voiced optimism that one day the British Open would return to Turnberry. It was last held at Trump's course on the Scottish west coast in 2009, five years before Trump purchased the resort.
    


            “I think they will do that,” Trump said Friday. “Turnberry is rated the No. 1 course in the world.”
    


            The organizers of the Open have said concerns over lack of hotel space and some local road infrastructure challenges have prevented the championship from being played there. Politics is also at play, which was underscored by a full-page advertisement in the National newspaper on Friday that urged the public to sign a petition against it.
    


            “Don't let the divisiveness of Donald Trump hijack and overshadow this great event,” the advertisement said. “Do the right thing. Don't give The Open to Trump Turnberry.”

A federal judge denied on Friday the Trump administration's attempts to make Chicago shed its “sanctuary city” status and assist the federal government's immigration efforts.

United States District Judge Lindsay Jenkins said the lawsuit, filed by the Trump administration against the state of Illinois, would encroach upon states' autonomy.

The judge cited the principles of “dual sovereignty,” determining it was “impossible to ignore the state sovereignty concerns” that would arise if the Trump administration's policy overtook state and local rules.

She also said the effort was an “end-run around the Tenth Amendment,” which protects states from any federal government overreach.

Illinois passed a law in 2021 prohibiting local or state officials from sharing a person's custody status, release date, or contact information with federal immigration officials. The Justice Department believes federal law overrides that law and other sanctuary policies, but Jenkins disagreed.

Several large cities run by Democrats have refused to assist the federal government in their immigration efforts in the past, earning the moniker “sanctuary cities” for harboring illegal immigrants.

Chicago, New York City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco are among the “sanctuary” cities.

The Trump administration has targeted cities for their sanctuary policies, hoping to force them to relent and assist with their mass deportation effort. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced on Thursday that the Department of Justice would sue New York City Mayor Eric Adams over the city's sanctuary policies after an off-duty Border Patrol officer was shot during an attempted robbery.

“The Department of Justice is suing New York City and Mayor Eric Adams for continuing to obstruct law enforcement with sanctuary city policies. If New York's leaders won't step up to protect their citizens, we will,” she wrote in a post on X.

The DOJ tried to include Gov. JB Pritzker (D-IL) in their case against Illinois, but the judge dismissed him as she found no legal basis for his inclusion.

Pritzker has been antagonistic to the Trump administration's immigration efforts.

“I'm aware that the president and Tom Homan have been targeting the city of Chicago in particular,” he said this week. 

“When you're attacking the people who live here — many people who have been here for decades, paying taxes, law-abiding, raising their children, good members of their community — when you're attacking those people in my state, I don't want you here,” he added.

            When British traders landed on India's shores in the 1600s, they arrived in search of spices and silk but stayed for centuries – leaving behind a legacy that would shape the nation long after their colonial exploitation ended: the English language.
    


            Over the centuries, English seeped into the very fabric of Indian life – first as a tool of commerce, then as the language of law and, eventually, a marker of privilege.
    


            Now, after more than a decade of Hindu-nationalist rule, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is mounting perhaps the most significant challenge yet to the language's place in India.
    


            “Those who speak English will soon feel ashamed,” Home Minister Amit Shah said last month, igniting a heated debate about national identity and social mobility in the polyglot nation of 1.4 billion.
    


            While Shah did not mention India's former colonial masters, he declared that “the languages of our country are the jewels of our culture” – and that without them, “we cease to be truly Indian.”
    


            Spoken behind the walls of colonial forts and offices, English in India was at first the language of ledgers and treaties.
    


            But as British rule expanded from the ports of Gujarat to the palaces of Delhi, it became the lingua franca of the colonial elite.
    


            At independence, India faced a dilemma. With hundreds of languages and dialects spoken across its vast landscape, its newly appointed leaders grappled with the question of which one should represent the new nation.
    


            Hindi, the predominant language in the north, was put forward as a candidate for official language.
    


            But strong resistance from non-Hindi-speaking regions – especially in the south – meant English would remain only as a temporary link to unite the country. It's a legacy that endures to this day – and still rankles some.
    


            “I subscribe to the view that English is the language of the colonial masters,” Pradeep Bahirwani, a retired corporate executive from the southern city of Bengaluru, said, adding: “Our national language should be a language which… has got roots in India.”
    


            But critics argue that Shah's remarks risk undermining the country's global competitiveness. Equating English with cultural shame, they contend, reflects a narrow perspective that needlessly tries to erase a remnant of the colonial era that keeps India fluent in the language of global commerce.
    


            “It's the aspiration of people to have access to a language which has a lot of prestige internationally,” said Indian linguist Ayesha Kidwai, a professor at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University. “I don't think it's the legacy of colonialism anymore.”
    


            And pushback to the BJP's recent messaging has been strong.
    


            “English is not a barrier, it's a bridge. English is not shame, it's strength,” wrote leader of the opposition Rahul Gandhi on X, after Shah's remarks last month. “Every Indian language has a soul, culture, and knowledge. We must cherish them – and at the same time, teach every child English.”
    


            CNN has contacted India's Home Ministry for comment.
    


            But language tensions are no longer confined to debates in parliament – they're spilling into the streets.
    


            Just last week, video of a heated confrontation on a train in India's financial hub Mumbai went viral after a passenger was allegedly harassed for not speaking the regional language Marathi. Clashes erupted elsewhere in the city over the federal government's drive to promote Hindi – a language closely tied to the BJP's northern power base and often seen as central to the party's vision of national unity and Hindu identity.
    


            Since India's independence from Britain in 1947, the status of English in India has been deeply political – entwined with questions of identity, power, and national direction.
    


            Today, English is one of several official languages in India, spoken by about 10% of the population. Hindi is the first language for around 44% of citizens, according to the 2011 census.
    


            But in recent years, Modi's BJP has placed particular emphasis on promoting Hindi and reducing the use of English in public life.
    


            The prime minister almost never delivers speeches in English, preferring Hindi for national addresses such as his monthly radio program. His administration has encouraged officials to use Hindi on social media and in government correspondence – though, after criticism from non-Hindi-speaking states, clarified that this was intended mainly for the Hindi belt in the north.
    


            When India hosted world leaders for the 2023 G20 summit in New Delhi, invitations were sent out from “Bharat” – the Sanskrit or Hindi name for the country – instead of “India,” fueling speculation that the government aims to ultimately phase out the country's English designation altogether.
    


            Modi's critics have been quick to note his political motives behind these moves.
    


            With its roots in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing organization that advocates Hindu hegemony within India, the BJP's language policies resonate with many in a country where nearly 80% of people are Hindu.
    


            Analysts say the BJP is seeking to capitalize on this demographic by promoting language policies that strengthen its support base in the north.
    


            According to Rita Kothari, an English professor from Ashoka University, the government “is certainly interested in homogenizing the country and making Hindi more widespread.”
    


            But that policy can also backfire – in part because many regions, such as Marathi-speaking Maharashtra in the west – are staunchly proud of their local language.
    


            The violent clashes in the state's megacity Mumbai earlier this month were sparked by the regional government's controversial decision to make Hindi a compulsory third language in public primary schools.
    


            Pushback and protest has also been especially strong in the south, where English and regional languages such as Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada are valued as symbols of local identity and autonomy.
    


            For 19-year-old Steve E. Selvaraj from Tamil Nadu's capital Chennai, “the BJP did a great job turning Hindi as their identity.” The college student, whose mother tongue is Tamil, said Hinduism has become a central focus for the ruling establishment – a way to “get more votes.”
    


            “Day by day, the influence of Hindi is increasing,” Selvaraj said. “Hindi imposition may be a threat, but it will take a lot of time to disconnect the (local) connection with Tamil.”
    


            Kothari, from Ashoka University, said going after English was a convenient way of the BJP promoting Hindi without ruffling regional feathers.
    


            The government “knows that its chances of success in south India for instance are thwarted by linguistic pride and nationalism,” she said.
    


            “Since they can't make this public, English becomes a whipping boy.”
    


            India's widespread adoption of English can be traced back to the 19th-century British politician Thomas Macaulay, who advocated for the introduction of the language as the medium of instruction, instead of traditional languages of the elite like Sanskrit, Persian or Arabic.
    


            Macaulay's vision was unapologetically elitist. Creating a class of subjects who were “Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals, and in intellect,” to serve as intermediaries between the colonial administration and the local population, he wrote, would help the British rule more effectively.
    


            These views were adopted by the British government, making English the language of Indian administration, higher education and the judiciary. The policy fostered a privileged English-educated elite – lawyers, teachers and writers – including many of India's early reformer nationalists, first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi.
    


            But over time, English became far more than a holdover from colonial rule – turning into a symbol of modernity and opportunity. As India's economy transformed and its middle class expanded, English proficiency became crucial to upward mobility.
    


            For Shivam Singh, 23, the first in his family to speak English and to leave home for university, the language opened doors.
    


            “I wanted to get a good job… English gives you an edge. All the internships I cracked was because I could hold conversations in English.”
    


            Singh practiced his spoken English on an AI app for hours, getting feedback that helped earn him the internships.
    


            India is now home to one of the world's largest English-speaking populations, with more than 130 million people reporting English proficiency in the 2011 census. This linguistic advantage has helped attract billions in foreign investment, enabled global partnerships, and powered sectors from tech support to startups.
    


            Yet, the prominence of English has also deepened social divides. Those without language skills find themselves largely excluded from lucrative careers.
    


            Wealthier, urban, or higher-caste families are far more likely to be fluent in English and English-medium schools are mainly concentrated in urban areas, leaving rural and lower-caste communities locked out.
    


            “I am not able to find a (well-paying), because they say I do not know English,” said Vaishnavi Gujanan Narote, a housekeeper at a hotel in the capital New Delhi.
    


            She added: “If you know Hindi, then all you can do is stay here and do odd jobs, but not get a good post, because English is a requirement.”
    


            Vijay Kumar, a computer teacher at a non-government organization in Delhi, never learned the language at school. “I feel I did not get the opportunities in my life because I did not know English,” he said.
    


            The dominance of English and Hindi, along with rapid urbanization, have marginalized many of the country's indigenous languages – tongues spoken by hundreds of tribal communities now far removed from the mainstream.
    


            UNESCO classes nearly 200 Indian languages as endangered, and more than 220 languages in the country have disappeared in the last 50 years, according to the People's Linguistic Survey of India.
    


            “Many languages in India do not get the respect or place they deserve,” said Aloka Kujur, a writer and activist from Jharkhand, whose mother tongue is Kuduk, a tribal language native to the east Indian state.
    


            The proliferation of English, Kujur said, cost her community recognition in the country. Kuduk is spoken by just under 2 million people and is in a “vulnerable” state, according to UNESCO.
    


            Kujur said that in Jharkand, indigenous groups “have an affinity with their language that cannot be broken,” but notices that Kuduk's use in everyday life is slipping away.
    


            As India looks toward the future, analysts say the English language's role in the country might not be going anywhere any time soon.
    


            “There is no fear of sidelining English,” Kothari, from Ashoka University, said. “It is much too strong to be sidelined.”
    


            It's a sentiment Singh, the first student, agrees with.
    


            “We cannot afford to not learn English in India,” he said. “We are a developing country, we need to learn from the world.”

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) said he would introduce a bill to send rebate checks to working Americans after President Donald Trump floated the idea on Friday.

Trump said the excess tariff revenue could be used to deliver a rebate to the Americans, but also said he still wanted to pay down the government's debt.

“I will introduce legislation in the Senate to send a rebate check to every working person in America,” Hawley said in a post on X, reacting to Trump's idea.

The Missouri senator told the Washington Examiner: “Working people deserve to get some tax relief here. And this is a terrific way to deliver it to them. It's an opportunity to put cash right back in the hands of working Americans.”

Hawley's office also told the Washington Examiner that he will model the legislation “after the stimulus checks proposal he worked on with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) during COVID.” The pair, both populists, came together to support a second round of $1,200 stimulus checks in 2020.

Trump responded to a reporter's question about the rebates earlier Friday, saying, “We are thinking about a rebate because we have so much money coming in from tariffs that a little rebate for people of a certain income level might be very nice.”

The president issued sweeping tariffs earlier this year that he has dialed back at various points, corresponding to either market panic or whether he makes trade deals with certain countries. The tariffs will generate revenue, but experts warned they could raise consumer prices.

Hawley's bill has yet to be introduced. It's unclear when the legislation will be introduced or what the details of the rebate check-in will be. The president did not specify how much the rebate would be, just that it would be given to people of “certain income” levels.

Any nationwide rebate would have to be approved by Congress. Hawley could team with a senator like Sanders to introduce the bill to increase its chances of passing.

Republicans control the House and Senate, making it likely such a rebate bill could pass if it hits the floor for a vote.

GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) — Ed Policy began his tenure as the Green Bay Packers' president/CEO by paying tribute to his predecessor.

Policy officially took over for Mark Murphy on Friday as the NFL's only publicly owned franchise held its annual shareholders meeting. During Murphy's 17 seasons on the job, the Packers made 13 playoff appearances, with the 2010 team winning a Super Bowl.

“I assure you that going forward I'm going to lean heavily on your example and your pearls of wisdom as I move the organization into the future,” Policy said.

Murphy is stepping down because he reached the franchise's mandatory retirement age of 70 earlier this month. Murphy said he felt he could continue meeting the demands of this position but added that he agrees with the Packers' retirement policy.

“In my career – business and with the league and others – you see examples where maybe people stay on a little too long, so I think this serves the Packers well,” Murphy said.

Policy, 54, didn't focus much on his own plans during the shareholders meeting, which instead pretty much served as a testimonial for Murphy.

There were plenty of shouts of “Thank you, Mark,” among the 6,529 shareholders in the Lambeau Field stands. On a hot afternoon, many shareholders tried to cool themselves off by waving fans that featured Murphy's face. A tribute video included messages from NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and former commissioner Paul Tagliabue among others.




Murphy signed autographs and greeted fans after the Packers' Friday morning practice and again after the shareholders meeting.

“It's a little bittersweet,” Murphy said. “Obviously, I'm a very appreciative and I also feel honored, too, that the fans have been so supportive of me and the organization. But (I'm) really excited too for the future of the organization and for Ed in particular.”

The Packers say Murphy, who played defensive back for Washington from 1977-84, is believed to be the only person to earn a Super Bowl ring both as a player and as a team's chief executive. He was on Washington's 1982 championship team.

His stint as Green Bay's president/CEO included the construction of Titletown, a 45-acre development adjacent to Lambeau Field that features shops, restaurants and apartments.

He capped his tenure earlier this year by welcoming the NFL Draft to Green Bay, an event that drew an announced three-day total attendance of 600,000. Murphy also presided over multiple renovations to Lambeau Field, including the opening of a new home locker room this week.

“He's been tremendous for us,” wide receiver Jayden Reed said. “I thanked him today, knowing this was his last day here, so I went up to him and I thanked him for everything. Without him, we wouldn't be standing in this locker room right now. He's been a tremendous help to all of us, very supportive. He gets this thing done. I appreciate him for that.”

Murphy said he hopes to stay involved in the game and noted that he's talked to Goodell about things he'd like to do on a league level. He also mentioned spending more time with his family and increasing his involvement in his charity work and in the golf course he owns at Baileys Harbor, Wisconsin.

The Packers' board of directors unanimously selected Policy as Murphy's replacement after a search committee recommended him last year. Policy, the son of former San Francisco 49ers and Cleveland Browns president, joined the Packers as vice president and general counsel in August 2012 and was promoted to chief operating officer in January 2018.

“I want to thank you, our owners, for investing so much in me over the past 13 years,” Policy told the shareholders. “It's been really special, and I intend to pay it back with results both on and off the field.”

Packers coach Matt LaFleur, general manager Brian Gutekunst and executive vice president/director of player operations Russ Ball report to the president/CEO under the team's leadership structure. All three of them have two years remaining on their contracts.

Policy said earlier this year he has no plans to extend those contracts before this season, though he praised all three men and noted his long working relationships with them.

“(I'm) certainly going to miss Mark and everything that he's done for this place, but feel like we're in great hands with a guy like Ed Policy,” LaFleur said.

Murphy was asked what advice he had for Policy.

“The one thing I told him is he's got to be himself,” Murphy said. “I've seen him grow quite a bit as a leader. The search ended up with him. They did a great job. There's no question he's positioned and ready to have success.

“He and I have talked about it. Don't be afraid to change things. Follow your instincts. He's got really good business sense. Hopefully we put him in a position where he can have success not only in the short term but the long term of the organization.”

NOTES: LaFleur said OL Aaron Banks is “day to day” with a back issue. … Rookie WR Savion Williams didn't practice Friday due to a concussion.

The more the merrier at Meta.

The AI talent wars took another turn on Friday when Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Shengjia Zhao, co-creator of ChatGPT and the former lead scientist at OpenAI, is now the chief scientist at Meta's Superintelligence Labs.

"In this role, Shengjia will set the research agenda and scientific direction for our new lab working directly with me and Alex," a statement shared to Zuckerberg's Threads account said. "Shengjia co-founded the new lab and has been our lead scientist from day one."

The statement said Meta chose to formalize Zhao's leadership position because recruiting is "going well" and the team "is coming together."

While the announcement elicited congratulatory remarks from some AI enthusiasts online, and more discussion about Meta's ongoing poaching spree, others asked: What about Yann LeCun?

LeCun became a prominent figure in the AI industry after joining Meta, then Facebook, in 2013. He serves as the chief AI scientist for Meta's Fundamental AI Research, formerly known as Facebook AI Research. On LinkedIn, LeCun acknowledged the questions and clarified his role at Meta.

"My role as Chief Scientist for FAIR has always been focused on long-term AI research and building the next AI paradigms," LeCun wrote on Friday. "My role and FAIR's mission are unchanged."

Zuckerberg and Alexandr Wang, the Scale AI founder who joined Meta in June as its chief AI officer, confirmed that LeCun's role is unchanged on their respective social media accounts.

Although both FAIR and the Superintelligence Labs deal with AI, they're slightly different.

Meta created FAIR over a decade ago to research and advance AI technology, which resulted in the 2023 release of its open-source large language model, Llama. LeCun is now largely focused on developing a new kind of model, known as a world model, that could one day replace large language models.

The Superintelligence Labs, meanwhile, is the umbrella department housing Meta's FAIR, foundations, and products teams, Zuckerberg said in an internal memo in June. Zuckerberg said the Superintelligence Labs would focus on developing "personal superintelligence for everyone." Bloomberg reported that LeCun would report to Wang.

Wang praised Zhao in an X post on Friday.

"Shengjia is a brilliant scientist who most recently pioneered a new scaling paradigm in his research," Wang said in an X post on Friday. "He will lead our scientific direction for our team."

LeCun said he's looking forward to working with Zhao "to accelerate the integration of new research into our most advanced models."

Two-thirds of Americans drink coffee every single day, according to data collected by the National Coffee Association in 2022, and the debate about how much is too much and whether or not any amount of caffeine is safe persists. But recent research shows that the answer is more complicated than you'd think.

A Harvard study, that followed nearly 50,000 women over the course of 30 years and published in June, found that drinking coffee every day may lead to healthy aging in women. One to three cups a day was also linked to heart health benefits and lower mortality rates.

But research also shows that high coffee consumption can increase your likelihood of dementia. And a 2022 paper published in the Journal of the American Heart Association found a link between heavy coffee consumption and an increased risk of dying from cardiovascular disease in people with hypertension.

Benefits, drawbacks, and the right amount all depend on your individual lifestyle and overall health. And health experts consistently advise that, like with most things, moderation is key for your daily coffee.

Deepak Chopra, author, speaker and proponent of alternative medicine, told CNBC Make It in 2023 that he drinks two to three cups of coffee each day before noon. While that may sound like too much caffeine for the average person, it's actually within a healthy range.

"Drinking two to three cups before noon is safe to do," registered dietitian Roxana Ehsani said in an interview with CNBC Make It last year. "As long as they don't greatly surpass 400 milligrams of caffeine."

Ehsani's suggestion follows the Food and Drug Administration's recommendation of consuming no more than 400 milligrams of caffeine a day, which can include the caffeine found in teas, energy drinks, sodas and chocolate.

Certain people may benefit from consuming much less caffeine than is recommended by the FDA.

Caffeine tolerance varies from person to person, with some people feeling anxious or jittery after just one or two cups of coffee.

"Within those milligram or cup of coffee recommendations, if you start feeling overly tired and the caffeine is not helping, then you've got to stop [drinking it]," dietitian Jessica Sylvester told NBC News.

"If your heart starts beating incredibly fast, you've got to stop. It's different for each person."

Pregnant people should consider cutting back on caffeine. And people who have diabetes or cardiovascular disease should be mindful of their sugar intake when having coffee, Nikki Cota, a dietitian at the Mayo Clinic, told NBC News.

Expert opinion also varies on if teens should drink coffee, but "avoiding caffeine is the best choice for all kids," according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.

But for everyone else, if you're having two to three cups, or more, "be mindful of what you're experiencing," registered dietitian Maddie Pasquariello says. And make sure you're not replacing meals with caffeine.

Ehsani recommends drinking water or having a meal before reaching for coffee since caffeine suppresses appetite.

And if you notice your sleep is affected when you have a coffee in the afternoon, experts suggest a mornings-only rule for your daily latte or macchiato.

The ongoing rise of artificial intelligence is having a significant impact on many types of jobs, particularly entry-level positions and especially on roles that involve lots of automation. And while AI might not be eliminating a large percentage of early career jobs, as recent headlines have proclaimed, it certainly is changing them in a big way.

"AI is reshaping entry-level roles by automating routine, manual tasks," said Fawad Bajwa, global AI, data, and analytics practice leader at executive search and leadership advisory firm Russell Reynolds Associates. "Instead of drafting emails, cleaning basic data, or coordinating meeting schedules, early-career professionals have begun curating AI-enabled outputs and applying judgment."

For example, people working in entry-level marketing jobs are using generative AI to create first drafts of promotional or campaign documents, and early career data analysts are relying on AI to prepare datasets, Bajwa said.

"AI is reshaping all jobs," said Zanele Munyikwa, an economist at labor analytics firm Revelio Labs. He pointed out that hiring for entry-level jobs is down in general, regardless of AI exposure. "AI-exposed entry-level jobs are seeing bigger drops in demand, but the difference to non-exposed jobs is small," he said.

What AI is doing is forcing an "occupational transformation" among entry-level roles, Munyikwa said. For example, the firm's research has shown that tasks performed by junior-level professionals are shifting toward less AI-exposed functions.

The most AI-exposed jobs tend to be technical, such as data engineers, database administrators, IT specialists, and cybersecurity personnel, as well as financial workers such as auditors, Munyikwa said. And in an interesting twist, the most exposed jobs are also adopting AI the most, making them more productive, he said.

In some of these occupations, up to 30% of workers are already using AI to perform their day-to-day tasks, according to Revelio Labs' research, and for those who use these tools, the productivity gains can be significant.

"Increases in productivity may eventually lead to fewer headcounts in certain job families, but also create jobs elsewhere," Munyikwa said. "While AI may currently have some productivity boosting capabilities, it needs to be applied and used consistently across large parts of the organization to take effect."

That requires investments in AI tool training and thoughtful restructuring of job requirements and capabilities, Munyikwa said. "This will take a lot of time and careful leadership to even partially achieve big cost savings," he said.

Jobs with low AI exposure frequently involve tasks that are difficult to automate, the Revelio Labs' research noted. These positions include manual jobs in manufacturing, hospitality roles, or interpersonal work, which still require a steady pipeline of human workers. Compared with 2010, demand for these roles has grown more quickly than for high-exposure roles, the research said.

To be sure, AI is already eliminating some entry-level functions in companies. "Generally, jobs that are repetitive, rule-based, and easily codified are most at risk," Bajwa said. Many are not disappearing overnight but rather are being fundamentally transformed and restructured to involve more oversight and less manual work, he said.

Although it is highly unlikely that there would be a significant impact on entry-level jobs in the short term, Bajwa said, "organizations must redesign how early talent is onboarded, developed, and integrated in order to navigate the decade ahead," he said. "Without foundational tasks, it's harder for people to build experience, leading to a fundamental gap in terms of how new professionals will build judgment, confidence and fluency."

In fact, 54% of the 3,000 executives from Russell Reynolds' global network that the company surveyed are concerned that AI reliance is eroding critical thinking, and one-quarter are worried about AI inadvertently undermining product/service quality and critical internal process quality. 

A growing number of leaders across industries are also concerned about AI-driven layoffs, according to the RRA research. Last year 20% said they were concerned, compared with 40%in the latest survey.

CIOs and other technology leaders need to be prepared for the impact of AI on current and future entry-level jobs within their departments, especially considering how aggressively many are launching AI initiatives.

"It changes both talent strategy and team design," Bajwa said. "Tech leaders must now rethink how they develop junior talent and build future pipelines. The goal isn't just efficiency; it's ensuring AI-augmented teams can still grow, learn and lead," he said. 

With the possible reduction in some entry-level technology positions, there is a potential for more top-heavy team structures, Muniykwa said. "Tech leaders need to redesign workflows and roles as they implement AI," he said.

Businesses will need new "on-ramps", for example, apprenticeships and AI-assisted boot camps, so early-career talent can still learn and advance even as some traditional entry-level tasks disappear, Munyikwa said. "Leaders must plan for continuous upskilling, not one-off training sessions, to keep teams productive alongside rapidly evolving AI tools," he said.

Rehearsing a big presentation or jotting down some notes before a one-on-one meeting with your boss is normal.

You should use a similar, truncated practice before casual interactions, recommends conversation expert Alison Wood Brooks: Take 30 seconds before greeting the other person to think about topics to go over, questions you want to ask or your goals for the conversation.

Putting forethought into your casual chats can make you look smart, prepared and considerate — like a good friend who remembers even minute details of past conversations — says Wood Brooks, a Harvard University associate professor who teaches an MBA course called "How to talk gooder in business and life."

Try preparing for even casual conversations, whether you're meeting a co-worker for lunch or an old friend for dinner, Wood Brooks advises. "Even if you're calling a friend you know well or your mom, what we find in our research is that even 30 seconds of forethought will make that conversation go better," she says.

A small moment of mental preparation can help you stay present while you're talking and listening, says Wood Brooks, author of the 2025 book, "Talk: The Science of Conversation and the Art of Being Ourselves." After the conversation starts, you'll have less brainpower to come up with talking prompts or conversational segues, she adds.

"Once the conversation is underway, your brain becomes very busy ... listening to the other person's words, trying to read their emotional expressions, preparing what you're going to say next," says Wood Brooks. "It's a very cognitively overwhelming task. We're better at brainstorming what we should talk about ... before that conversation begins."

Sharp communication skills can help build relationships and propel your career, but being a good conversationalist often takes continual practice, Wood Brooks says.

For example, you can always practice focusing more on the other person than yourself, speaking expert and author John Bowe wrote for CNBC Make It on September 25. "You've asked this person for their attention; now give them yours," wrote Bowe. "Concentrate on what they're saying and try to intuit why they're saying it. Everything else will come naturally."

One particularly powerful phrase, according to conversation expert and Stanford University lecturer Matt Abrahams: "Tell me more."

"'Tell me more' is a support response; it supports what the other person is saying. The opposite is a 'shift' response," which is a statement that shifts the conversation back to you," Abrahams wrote in October 2023, adding: "So many people make the mistake of treating other people's stories as openings for them to talk about themselves. But if you do that often, you miss an opportunity to learn more."

In this article

At Tesla, vehicle sales are slumping, profits are thinning and revenue from regulatory credit sales are poised to dry up due to Republican-led policy changes.

In the past, CEO Elon Musk's futuristic promises have convinced investors to look past top and bottom line numbers.

Not now.

Following another fairly dismal earnings report this week, Musk told analysts on the call that Tesla's electric vehicles will soon become driverless, making money for owners while they sleep. He also said Tesla's robotaxi service, which the company recently started testing in a limited capacity in Austin, Texas, will expand to other states, with a goal of being able to reach half the U.S. population by year-end, "assuming we have regulatory approvals."

It didn't matter.

Tesla shares plummeted 8% on Thursday as investors focused on the immediate challenges facing the company, including the rapid rise of lower-cost EV competitors, particularly in China, and a political backlash against Musk that harmed Tesla's brand in the U.S. and Europe.

Automotive sales declined 16% year-over-year in the second quarter for the EV maker, with weak sales numbers continuing in Europe and California. Musk said there could be a "few rough quarters" ahead because of the EV credits expiring and President Donald Trump's tariffs.

The stock bounced back some on Friday, gaining 3.5%, but still ended the week down and has now fallen 22% this year, the worst performance among tech's megacaps. The Nasdaq rose 1% for the week and is up more than 9% in 2025, closing at a record on Friday.

"Look, we love robotaxis. And robots," wrote analysts at Canaccord Genuity, who recommend buying Tesla's stock, in a note after the earnings report. "Over time, Tesla is well positioned to benefit from these future-forward opportunities."

The analysts, however, said that they're focused on the profit and loss statement, writing: "But we love growth too, in the here and now. We need the P&L dynamics to turn."

Analysts at Jefferies described the earnings update as "a bit dull." And Goldman Sachs said Tesla's robotaxi effort is "still small" with limited technical data points.

Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment.

Musk, who has previously called himself "pathologically optimistic," has been able to sway shareholders and send the stock soaring at times with promises of self-driving cars, humanoid robots and more affordable EVs.

But after a decade of missed self-imposed deadlines on autonomous driving, Wall Street is watching Tesla fall behind Alphabet's Waymo in the U.S. and Baidu's Apollo Go in China.

In Tesla's shareholder deck, the company said the second quarter marked the start of its "transition from leading the electric vehicle and renewable energy industries to also becoming a leader in AI, robotics and related services." The company didn't offer any new guidance for growth or profits for the year ahead.

Business Insider reported on Friday that Tesla told staff its robotaxi service could launch in the San Francisco Bay Area as soon as this weekend.

But Tesla hasn't applied for permits that would be required to run a driverless ridehailing service in California, CNBC confirmed. The company would first need authorizations from the state's Department of Motor Vehicles and the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).

The CPUC told CNBC on Friday, that under existing permits, Tesla can only operate a human-driven chartered vehicle service, not carry passengers in robotaxis.

On the earnings call, Musk and other Tesla execs claimed the company was working on regulatory approvals to launch in Nevada, Arizona, Florida and other markets, in addition to San Francisco, but offered no details about what would be required.

Within Austin, the company said its robotaxi service had driven 7,000 miles, and that Tesla has been restricting its robotaxis' to roads with a speed limit of 40 miles per hour. The Austin service involves a small fleet of about 10 to 20 Model Y vehicles equipped with the company's latest self-driving systems.

The Tesla robotaxis rely on remote supervision by employees in a customer service center, and a human safety supervisor in the front passenger seat, ready to intervene if needed.

Compare that to what Alphabet said on its second-quarter earnings call the same day as Tesla's results.

"The Waymo Driver has now autonomously driven over 100 million miles on public roads, and the team is testing across more than 10 cities this year, including New York and Philadelphia," Alphabet said. Meanwhile, Waymo has become significant enough that Alphabet added a category to its Other Bets revenue description in its latest quarterly filing.

"Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of autonomous transportation services, healthcare-related services and internet services," the filing said. The Other Bets segment remains relatively small, with revenue coming in at $373 million in the quarter. 

Regardless of investor skepticism, Musk is more bullish than ever.

On Friday, the world's richest person posted on his social network X that he thinks Tesla will someday be worth $20 trillion. On the earnings call earlier in the week, he said that when it comes to AI for cars and robots, "Tesla is actually much better than Google by far" and "much better than anyone at real world AI."

CORRECTION: The Waymo Driver has now autonomously driven over 100 million miles on public roads, according to Alphabet. A previous version misstated the number of miles.

WATCH: Tough quarter for Tesla

President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff powers and recent trade deals could soon run into a legal buzzsaw.

A federal appeals court is set to hear oral arguments next week in a high-profile lawsuit challenging Trump's stated authority to effectively slap tariffs at any level on any country at any time, so long as he deems them necessary to address a national emergency.

The Trump administration says that that expansive tariff power derives from the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA.

The bulk of Trump's biggest tariffs — including his fentanyl-related duties on Canada, Mexico and China, and the worldwide "reciprocal" tariffs he first unveiled in early April — rest on his invocation of that law.

The U.S. Court of International Trade struck those tariffs down in late May, ruling that Trump exceeded his authority under IEEPA.

But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit quickly paused that decision, keeping the tariffs in effect while Trump's legal challenge plays out.

The case, known as V.O.S. Selections v. Trump, is the furthest along of more than half a dozen federal lawsuits challenging Trump's use of the emergency-powers law.

It's set for oral argument before the Federal Circuit on Thursday morning.

"I think the tariffs are at risk," said Ted Murphy, partner and head of global trade practice at law firm Sidley Austin, in an interview with CNBC.

The law has "never been used for this purpose," and it's "being used quite broadly," Murphy said. "So I think there are legitimate questions."

IEEPA gives Trump some powers to deal with national emergencies stemming from "any unusual and extraordinary threat" that comes in whole or in large part from outside the U.S.

But attorneys representing the handful of small businesses that sued Trump argue that the law does not let him unilaterally impose tariffs.

"IEEPA nowhere mentions tariffs, duties, imposts, or taxes, and no other President in the statute's nearly 50-year history has claimed that it authorizes tariffs," they wrote in a court brief this month.

Attorneys for Trump and his administration, however, argue that Congress has long empowered presidents to impose tariffs to address key national concerns.

They argue that the statute's language authorizing Trump to "regulate … importation" means he can use it to impose tariffs.

No matter how the Federal Circuit ultimately rules in V.O.S., the case appears destined for the Supreme Court, which bears a 6-3 conservative majority and includes three justices appointed by Trump.

But some experts still expect that Trump's IEEPA tariffs will be scrapped.

"Trump will probably continue to lose in the lower courts, and we believe the Supreme Court is highly unlikely to rule in his favor," U.S. policy analysts from Piper Sandler wrote in a research note Friday morning.

The analysts wrote that such a loss would effectively mean the collapse of almost every trade development that Trump has held up as an accomplishment during his first six months in office.

"If the Supreme Court rules against Trump, all of the trade deals Trump has reached in recent weeks — and those he will reach in the coming days — are illegal," the analysts wrote.

"So are his letters informing countries of their new tariffs, the current 10% minimum, and the reciprocal tariffs he has proposed or threatened," they added.

It is technically unclear whether everything Piper Sandler describes is undergirded by IEEPA. For instance, Trump has recently announced only the broad outlines of trade agreements with Japan, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines — and those deals have yet to be finalized.

However, Trump in mid-June signed an executive order specifying that he is invoking the emergency-powers law as part of a U.S. trade agreement with the United Kingdom.

Trump this month has also sent 25 letters to individual world leaders, dictating the new tariff rates that their countries' U.S. exports will face starting Aug. 1.

That is the date when Trump's reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries' imports — which were unveiled in early April and then repeatedly put on pause — are set to turn back on. Trump has said that his letters are tantamount to bilateral trade deals.

Those letters do not explicitly reference IEEPA. But their language echoes the same arguments about unfair trade, deficits and national security that Trump invoked during his reciprocal tariff rollout.

"The Administration is legally and fairly using tariff powers that have been granted to the executive branch by the Constitution and Congress to level the playing field for American workers and safeguard our national security," White House spokesman Kush Desai told CNBC.

The White House ignored CNBC's request to confirm that Trump's leader-to-leader letters, and the tariff rates set in his recent spate of trade deals, hinge on IEEPA authority.

It has, however, confirmed that the massive 50% tariff Trump set on imports from Brazil did, in fact, rely on IEEPA powers.

Strangely, that letter focused less on trade and more on Trump's gripes about Brazil's treatment of its former president, Jair Bolsonaro, who is facing trial over his role in an alleged coup to overturn his 2022 reelection loss.

One day after the federal trade court issued its May decision in V.O.S., U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras delivered an even broader ruling against the Trump administration in a separate case in Washington, D.C., federal court.

The three-judge panel in V.O.S. specifically found that some of the tariffs Trump had imposed were unauthorized by IEEPA. But Contreras, in the case known as Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump, ruled that the law itself does not allow a president to take any unilateral tariff actions.

The government appealed that ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which paused a preliminary injunction that Contreras had issued. Oral arguments in the case are set for Sept. 30.

Two other federal lawsuits challenging the tariffs — one from the state of California, and one filed in Montana federal court by members of the indigenous Blackfeet nation — are set for separate oral arguments on Sept. 17 before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

At least three more pending cases before the Court of International Trade have been stayed until a final decision is returned in V.O.S., according to the Congressional Research Service.

The Trump administration has taken direct stakes in companies on a scale rarely seen in the U.S. outside wartime or economic crisis, pushing a Republican Party that traditionally championed free-market capitalism to embrace state intervention in industries viewed as important for national security.

Japan's Nippon Steel agreed to give President Donald Trump a "golden share" in U.S. Steel as a condition for the two companies' controversial merger. Trump now personally wields sweeping veto power over major business decisions made by the nation's third-largest steel producer.

"You know who has the golden share? I do," Trump said at a summit on artificial intelligence and energy in Pittsburgh on July 15.

The president's golden share in U.S. Steel is similar to nationalizing a company but without any of the benefits that a company normally receives, such as direct investment by the government, said Sarah Bauerle Danzman, an expert on foreign investment and national security at the Atlantic Council, a think tank focused on international affairs.

But the Trump administration demonstrated earlier this month that it is also willing to buy directly into publicly traded corporations. The Department of Defense agreed to purchase a $400 million equity stake in rare-earth miner MP Materials, making the Pentagon the company's largest shareholder.

This level of support by the federal government for a mining company is unprecedented, said Gracelin Baskaran, an expert on critical minerals at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

"This is the biggest public-private cooperation that the mining industry has ever had here in the United States," Baskaran said. "Historically, DOD has never done equity in a mining company or a mining project."

Trump's unique hold over the Republican Party gives him the ability to intervene in companies on a scale that would be difficult politically for a Democratic president, Danzman said.

"The Democrat would have been accused of being a communist and a lot of other Republicans probably would not have felt comfortable moving in this particular direction because of their greater commitment to market principles," Danzman said. Trump is expanding the range of what is possible in the U.S. in terms of state intervention in markets, she said.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

More interventions could be on the horizon as the Trump administration develops a policy to support U.S. companies in strategic industries against state-backed competition from China.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in April that the U.S. government might need to make an "equity investment in each of these companies that's taking on China in critical minerals." The Pentagon's investment in MP Materials is a model for future public-private partnerships, CEO James Litinsky said.

"It's a new way forward to accelerate free markets, to get the supply chain on shore that we want," Litinsky told CNBC. The U.S. government is helping the mining industry fight "Chinese mercantilism," the CEO said.

Meanwhile, the golden share in U.S. Steel is a potential model for foreign direct investment "transactions that really affect our national security but where it's going to be great for our economic growth," Sen. Dave McCormick, R-Pa., said in a May interview with CNBC.

"Having taken a stake in US Steel and MP, we're now left to wonder where this administration will find its next investment," Don Bilson, an analyst at Gordon Haskett, wrote in a note to clients earlier this month.

Trump proposed in January that the U.S. should take a 50% stake in social media app TikTok as part of a joint venture. China's ByteDance is required under a recently passed law to divest TikTok or the platform will be banned in the U.S. Trump extended ByteDance's compliance deadline until Sept. 17.

The U.S. has a long history of intervening in industries, particularly where national defense is concerned, said Mark Wilson, a historian at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, who studies the military-industrial complex.

But past interventions were often temporary and typically happened during war, economic crisis or took the form of bailouts to prevent a major player in a critical industry from going bankrupt.

The U.S. government bought a majority stake in General Motors to prevent the automaker from collapsing in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, ultimately selling off its shares at a loss to the taxpayer. In the 1970s, defense giant Lockheed and automaker Chrysler received government bailouts.

During World War I, President Woodrow Wilson nationalized the railroads, but he returned them to private ownership after the conflict. The Roosevelt administration made sweeping interventions during the Great Depression and World War II, from establishing the Tennessee Valley Authority to making big investments in the nation's manufacturing capacity.

The U.S. is not fighting an economic crisis or war today, but the return of great power competition with Russia and China and the supply chain disruptions of the Covid-19 pandemic have led to more nationalistic economic policies, said UNC's Wilson.

The U.S. has increasingly recognized that China's economic model is based on manufacturing overcapacity that dumps products "onto global markets in ways that make it hard for other markets to compete," Danzman said.

The threat posed by China's dominance of the rare-earth supply chain became apparent in April when Beijing imposed export restrictions against the U.S., Baskaran said. Within weeks, automakers warned they would have to halt production due to a rare-earth shortage, forcing the U.S. back to the negotiating table with Beijing, she said.

"The historical moment we're in does seem to be one where there is this reassessment of assumptions of the previous generation about the efficacy of markets and free trade to solve all our problems in national security," Wilson said.

The question is whether state intervention can solve the failure of the free market to address national security concerns in industries like rare earths, Danzman said.

"When you step in to try to address one of these market failures with this kind of government intervention, you can have a cascade of new market failures," she said. "You're distorting the market more."

ABOARD A NATO AWACS PLANE — As the aircraft soared over Eastern Europe, tiny triangles and U-shapes blinked across a glowing console. Each shape marked a presence — a ship, a fighter jet, or something else moving near the Baltic Sea and the militarized Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.

The NATO E-3A Sentry, a flying radar and airborne command post, was tracking them all, with its rotating radar dome scanning hundreds of miles in every direction.

"We're the eyes in the sky," said Maj. Ben, a US Air Force officer and the mission's fighter allocator. "Being up at 30,000 feet, we can look down and we see pretty much everything to the ground."

Business Insider was given access to a NATO AWACS flight this week for an eight-hour surveillance mission above Eastern Europe.

Departing from Geilenkirchen Air Base in western Germany — home to 14 aging E-3s — at 8 am, the plane flew east to support Baltic Sentry operations, an ongoing alliance effort focused on protecting undersea infrastructure after recent sabotage incidents in the Baltic Sea.

"Nice view, right?" someone in the cockpit, it wasn't immediately clear who, said into their headset as the plane poked through the thin cloud layer.

The airborne warning and control system, or AWACS, is a modified Boeing 707/320 passenger plane with a long-range radar and advanced sensors that can detect friendly or hostile objects from far away and collect data that can be distributed in real time to allied ground stations, ships, or other aircraft.

The E-3 is easily recognizable with its 360-degree rotating radar dome above the fuselage. It can see over 300 miles across the air and surface, giving commanders critical situational awareness at war or in peacetime.

As an older plane, the interior feels more like a Cold War time capsule than a 21st-century warplane, but this aircraft is actually a surveillance nerve center loaded with advanced and highly classified equipment, keeping tabs on things.

The surveillance mission is "the bread and butter of this platform," said Maj. Ben, who, like others BI spoke with during the flight, could only be identified by his rank and first name for security reasons.

The E-3 is capable of a range of missions, including surveillance, tracking, target detection, early warning, command and control, and battle management, making it a high-value military asset and one of the few that NATO itself actually owns.

NATO received its first E-3s in 1982. Despite their age, these planes have proven indispensable since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. After the full-scale assault in 2022, the AWACS fleet intensified its patrols to monitor Russian activity and deter aggression on NATO's eastern flank.

The AWACS functions like a high-flying office space, with a range of different roles and stations where crew members work at their computers or with other sensitive instruments. In the back of the aircraft are a few makeshift beds, a place to store and heat food, and a toilet. Looking at it in 2025, the interior is dated and almost feels like stepping into a museum.

This flying command station is anything but an artifact. The plane is packed with advanced capabilities. And just about everything the crew touches, from paperwork to computer screens, is classified and had to be sanitized before BI could take photos. The most sensitive area of the aircraft, where key communication systems are, is covered with a curtain.

The plane's big radar rotates once every 10 seconds and can detect everything from warships to aircraft to air defense systems. It gathers data that the surveillance operators can see on digital maps and immediately transmit to users on the ground, at sea, or in the air.

"Wherever the demand is for an air picture, we can go there," explained Cpt. Jasper, a Dutch surveillance controller who monitors the airspace and surface.

"That's something that static sites cannot do, and what most ground sites cannot do," he said, adding that this is the advantage of "having a big flying radar and air control station."

One screen BI was authorized to review showed activity in and above Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, the Baltic Sea, and Kaliningrad. The small but heavily militarized Russian province, sandwiched between two NATO countries, has long been a concern for the alliance. That is why the AWACS are watching, and they see everything.

If a Russian fighter jet took off from an airbase in Kaliningrad, the AWACS — circling just beyond its airspace — would surely spot it. The exclave hosts some of Moscow's ships, ground forces, and air defenses.

Cpt. Marek, a Polish passive controller who works with the AWACS' advanced sensors, said the aircraft provides extra "situational awareness" to the Baltic Sentry operation and for the eastern flank allies. He added that the aircraft is an essential part of European security, and that's especially been the case since the war in Ukraine started.

Beyond its robust surveillance capabilities, the E-3 is also a command and control platform that can coordinate with other aircraft and easily be retasked. This flight, for instance, was initially set to operate in Polish airspace but moved to Lithuanian airspace to support a training mission involving Portuguese F-16 fighter jets.

That flexibility is a critical capability for high-end fights, where numerous assets would be on the move in a fast-paced operating environment. "For the time we are now in, it's better to have a flexible force. We can go everywhere," said Cpt. Jasper said.

Key to the E-3's flexibility is its endurance. The aircraft can normally operate for eight and a half hours, although it can fly longer missions through its air-to-air refueling capability. At one point during the flight, the vintage seatbelt sign clicked on, signaling that this process was about to begin.

Aerial refueling is a delicate process that requires the AWACS pilots to drop altitude and fly the aircraft by hand so it can connect to the tanker and receive fuel. This made for a bumpy stretch that much of the crew elected to sleep through.

From the cockpit, the E-3 closed with the American KC-135 tanker aircraft, getting so close that the face of an airman inside could be seen to take on 40,000 pounds of fuel before separating and going on with its mission.

Dutch Cpt. Donny Demmers, a public affairs officer who was permitted to share his full name, said NATO can send an AWACS to operate from an area far from base, and thanks to the mid-air refueling, the plane can remain on station for a long time.

The E-3 flew back to Geilenkirchen and touched down shortly before 4 pm, but that flight time could have been greatly extended if needed during a crisis.

"The flexibility gives us the survivability," Demmers said.

Many engaged couples in the U.S. are relying on forms of credit to pay for their wedding. Experts say that approach can be smart, if done carefully.

While 46% of surveyed newlyweds — couples who tied the knot within the past two years — used mostly savings to pay for costs, 24% paid with credit cards, according to a report by LendingTree. The site polled 1,050 newlyweds in early March.

A separate report by Zola, based on a survey of 6,000 couples getting married in 2025, found that 31% of engaged couples polled plan to use credit cards to pay for their wedding, including using points or applying for new cards.

"If you're strategic, a credit card can be an amazing tool," said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree.

Otherwise, a credit card can be a slippery slope, leading couples to walk down the aisle with long-lasting and expensive debt, experts say.

About 67% of surveyed newlyweds took on debt for their wedding, according to LendingTree.

For new cards, the average annual percentage rate, or the borrowing cost, is 24.35%, the highest since December, LendingTree found.

"Ultimately, a beautiful wedding should never come at the cost of financial stress to a new marriage," said Gloria Garcia Cisneros, a certified financial planner at LourdMurray, an investment and wealth management firm.

Weddings are becoming more expensive every year. The average cost for a wedding in 2025 is expected to be $36,000, according to Zola. That's up from $33,000 in 2024, and $29,000 in 2023.

If you have savings set aside to cover your wedding costs, charging the expense to a credit card and then immediately using those savings to pay off the bill can help you earn rewards such as points or miles, said Schulz.

Some credit cards offer big sign-up bonuses when you spend a set amount on the card within a short period of opening it. That might be more than you spend on normal expenses, but within reach if you have big expenses — such as wedding-related purchases and deposits — coming up.

By immediately paying that charge off with your savings, you can take advantage of the rewards for things such as your honeymoon, Schulz said.

"It's a way to make those savings work even harder for you," he said.

Using a credit card can have other advantages, too. Credit cards offer layers of federal protection that can help cardholders dispute charges and get a refund if things go awry with an item or service purchased with a card, experts say.

Some cards also offer purchase protections, a form of insurance against theft or damages, per NerdWallet. Make sure to read the fine print of what your credit card offers and how long the terms last.

However, the key with credit cards "is to pay in full," said Ted Rossman, a senior industry analyst at Bankrate. 

"I definitely would not recommend putting wedding expenses on a card if you're going to be dragging that out over time," he said.

Not paying the balance off will leave you with high-interest debt as you start your new marriage.

Nearly a quarter, or 24%, of newlyweds married within two years of the survey are still paying the debt off, according to LendingTree. Of those that still owe money, 47% said they will finish paying the debt in six months to a year.

"You don't want to sacrifice your long-term well-being for a short-term event," Rossman said.

A 0% APR credit card can be a tool for wedding payments, as you'll be paying little to no interest on outstanding balances for a period of time. However, make sure to finish paying off the card before the promotion expires, experts say. Otherwise, whatever balance is left will then get interest tacked on.

As you begin to plan the wedding and reach out to vendors, ask if they accept credit cards as a form of payment, said Jason Rhee, a wedding planner in Los Angeles.

Some vendors might take only cash or check payments, while others might charge additional processing fees for credit cards, Rhee said. Such additional charges can range from 1.5% to 3.5%, according to Bankrate.

Assess whether paying the extra cost is both affordable and worth it to you, or if it's best to use a different form of payment with the vendor, said Lauren Kay, executive editor of The Knot.

What's more, some vendors may offer discounts for payments in cash.

While credit cards can offer certain protections to incurred payments or purchases, they might not offer broader protections or policies to cover larger expenditures, such as the reception or the venue, Kay said.

"In most instances, your credit card wouldn't offer any real benefit if something were to go wrong with a purchase of that magnitude," said Kay.

For such expenses, wedding insurance policies can be a good option to consider. They help protect you from unexpected risks such as extreme weather, theft or a vendor who didn't show up, said Kay.

Wedding insurance policy pricing can range from less than $100 to more than $1,000, according to NerdWallet, depending on the size of your policy and the kinds of coverage.

"It's important to think about what you're hoping to protect," Kay said.

In this article

There are two schools of thought around CBS' decision to end "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert."

The first says the cancellation is a one-off exit from the storied time slot — that Paramount was trying to push through the red tape to finally merge with Skydance Media, a deal that was approved by the Federal Communications Commission Thursday after more than a year in limbo.

The other says it signals the beginning of the end of late night TV.

The entertainment industry will have a better sense of where the truth lies next year when Disney decides the fate of Jimmy Kimmel's late night show, "Jimmy Kimmel Live."

While NBC recently extended the contracts of its two late night hosts, Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers, into 2028, Kimmel's contract is set to lapse in 2026.

"Jimmy Kimmel Live" has been a late night staple since 2003, acting not only as a typical talk show on the circuit, but as a valuable marketing hub for Disney's slate of theatrical and television content. In addition to traditional one-on-one interviews, Kimmel will also frequently host several stars from the same project, often for blockbuster titles from Marvel, Star Wars and the company's animated franchises.

Clips from these chats are fed onto Kimmel's YouTube channel, which has more than 20 million subscribers, and across social media, helping to generate buzz for upcoming Disney projects.

For comparison, Fallon's show account has around 32 million subscribers, while Colbert's stands at 10 million and Meyers' at just over 5 million.

Kimmel is also a frequent host of the Academy Awards, which airs on Disney's ABC, and is currently the host of ABC's celebrity edition of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire." These ancillary assignments, as well as his annual job closing out Disney's Upfronts presentation for advertisers, may make Kimmel more important to Disney's long-term future than Colbert was for Paramount or CBS.

Still, while the next test of media's commitment to late night is months off, the end of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" is calling attention to the mounting pressures on traditional TV and raising questions about the whether the time slot can survive the evolving viewing landscape.

The cost of producing late night programs has risen as the media industry has been upended by streaming and shifting consumer habits. The traditional pay TV bundle has lost millions of customers in recent years, and as they've disappeared, so too have advertising dollars.

The shifting equation has forced media companies to rebalance.

At a large scale, companies like Comcast's NBCUniversal and Warner Bros. Discovery have opted to split off their cable TV networks into separate corporate entities.

At the programming level, big shows are increasingly greenlit for release on streaming services rather than traditional networks. Salaries of highly paid news anchors have moderated, with some stepping away from traditional networks entirely and starting out their own ventures. And much of the money spent on bulking up both linear TV networks and streaming services is earmarked for live sports.

That leaves familiar titles in flux.

"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" employed around 200 people and recorded annual losses of around $40 million, according to a person familiar with the matter, who declined to be named speaking about nonpublic matters. "Jimmy Kimmel Live" employs around 250 people and loses roughly the same amount, according to a person familiar with that show's finances.

While the pay-TV bundle still rakes in the highest share of profits for legacy media companies – much of which stems from the fees that pay-TV distributors hand over to the networks to be included in the bundle – that figure is in decline.

Linear TV advertising revenue has also been on a steady downward slope. Industry analysts and experts expected the ad market to stabilize in 2025 after tumultuous streaming-centric years, but macroeconomic uncertainty has hampered the recovery.

In quarterly earnings that were reported in May, Paramount, NBCUniversal and Disney each reported lower ad sales on a year-over-year basis.

Paramount reported in May that its first-quarter TV advertising revenue was down 21% to $2.04 billion, mainly due to comparisons to the prior-year period when the company had the Super Bowl. That championship beckons the most ad dollars of any live event on TV. Without the Super Bowl, ad revenue would have been flat, the company said. Overall revenue for Paramount's TV segment was down 13%.

Of the traditional TV ad spend that does remain, the biggest share has gravitated to live sports, which draw the biggest audiences. NBCUniversal recently touted its record ad sales volume during the most recent Upfront cycle due to an upcoming slate of NBA, the Super Bowl, Winter Olympics and other sports.

Disney reported in May that quarterly revenue for its domestic linear networks was down 3% to $2.2 billion, attributing the decline to lower ad revenue. Still, Disney noted ad revenue for ESPN and sports in general saw an increase in ad revenue.

These headwinds help legitimize Paramount's decision to cancel "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," but the timing of the program's end has raised suspicions.

The announcement that Colbert's show would take its final bow in May 2026 came just days after the tenured host publicly called out Paramount for its $16 million settlement with President Donald Trump over the editing of a "60 Minutes" interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris.

Colbert called the settlement a "big fat bribe" during one of his show-opening monologues, referencing the then-pending merger between Paramount and Skydance Media, which required the approval of the Trump administration to proceed.

Paramount and CBS executives released a statement last week saying the cancellation was "purely a financial decision against the challenging backdrop in late night."

"It is not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount," the company continued.

While ratings for Colbert's show have declined over the last decade, the program has consistently achieved the highest views of any show in the 11:35 p.m. hour, outdrawing ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live" and NBC's "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon," according to Nielsen.

Still, Colbert's ratings have been declining each season. For the most recent September-to-May time period, Colbert averaged roughly 1.9 million viewers, with the majority of viewership coming in the age demographic of over 65, according to Nielsen — a telling data point about the state of TV viewership.

Kimmel's viewership paints a similar picture, with viewership dropping from the September-to-May time period in 2019-2020 to the most recent in 2024-2025, when the average was nearly 1.6 million viewers, according to Nielsen.

When Paramount listed its slate of highly rated TV shows during its last earnings report, including "Tracker," the top rated series and "Matlock," the highest rated new series, it also listed Colbert's "The Late Show" as the highest rated broadcast late night show. "The Daily Show," also from Paramount, was the top late night show on cable TV.

Some industry experts have questioned whether CBS could have explored other ways to save money — or save late night — besides outright canceling "The Late Show." NBC cut costs by eliminating the band on Meyers' late night show and shifting Fallon to four nights a week instead of five.

CBS tried to bring a younger demographic into the hour with "After Midnight," a late night show that ran after Colbert. The show was hosted by comedian Taylor Tomlinson and was centered on viral internet phenomena.

Though CBS intended to renew the show after its first two seasons, Tomlinson decided not to extend her contract, and the show was canceled.

SHANGHAI — The tech race between the world's two largest economies just intensified.

China on Saturday released a global action plan for artificial intelligence, calling for international cooperation on tech development and regulation.

The news came as the annual state-organized World Artificial Intelligence Conference kicked off in Shanghai with an opening speech by Premier Li Qiang, who announced that the Chinese government has proposed the establishment of a global AI cooperation organization, according to an official readout.

Days earlier, U.S. President Donald Trump announced an American action plan for AI that included calls to reduce alleged "woke" bias in AI models and support the deployment of U.S. tech overseas.

"The two camps are now being formed," said George Chen, partner at the Asia Group and co-chair of the digital practice.

"China clearly wants to stick to the multilateral approach while the U.S. wants to build its own camp, very much targeting the rise of China in the field of AI," Chen said.

He noted how China may attract participants from its Belt and Road Initiative, while the U.S. will likely have the support of its allies, such as Japan and Australia.

In his speech, Premier Li emphasized China's "AI plus" plan for integrating the tech across industries and said the country was willing to help other nations with the technology, especially in the Global South. The category loosely refers to less developed economies, especially countries outside the U.S. and European orbits.

Since 2022, the U.S. has sought to restrict China's access to advanced semiconductors for training AI models. Earlier this month, U.S. chipmaker Nvidia said the U.S. was allowing it to resume shipments of a less advanced H20 chip to China after a roughly three-month pause.

However, China has been developing homegrown alternatives, which Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang both praised and described as "formidable" this month during his third trip to China this year.

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt met with Shanghai Party Secretary Chen Jining on Thursday in the city ahead of the AI conference, according to a city announcement. A representative for Schmidt declined to comment.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland over the weekend, aiming to reach a framework trade agreement shortly before a 30% tariff on EU imports takes effect.

In a post on social media platform X on Friday, the EU's von der Leyen said she had agreed to meet with the U.S. president on Sunday "to discuss transatlantic trade relations, and how we can keep them strong."

Trump later confirmed the meeting would take place as he arrived in Scotland on Friday evening, saying, "We'll see if we can make a deal."

"I think we have a good 50/50 chance. That's a lot," he added.

It comes amid a sense of growing optimism about the prospect of a tariff breakthrough, with sources telling CNBC that the current base-case scenario for a deal includes a 15% tariff on EU imports to the U.S.

Trump has threatened to impose tariffs of 30% on EU goods beginning Aug.1, prompting the EU to consider countermeasures as part of its response.

The U.S. and EU have the largest bilateral trade and investment relationship in the world, representing almost 30% of global trade in goods and services, and accounting for 43% of global gross domestic product, according to EU figures.

Trump's four-day, golf-heavy visit to Scotland is also expected to include an informal meeting with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

Unlike the EU, the U.K. recently struck a trade deal with the Trump administration, one which is centered on a 10% tariff baseline on British goods arriving in the U.S.

The European Commission's chief spokesperson, Paula Pinho, said Saturday that "intensive negotiations" at the technical and political level were ongoing between the EU and U.S.

"Leaders will now take stock and consider the scope for a balanced outcome that provides stability and predictability for businesses and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic," Pinho said.

Hopes of the U.S. and EU averting a transatlantic trade war by Aug. 1 have been buoyed at least in part by the recent announcement of a framework agreement between the U.S. and Japan.

The U.S.-Japan deal, which Trump described in a social media post as "perhaps the largest Deal ever made," includes a baseline tariff rate of 15%.

Jack Allen-Reynolds, deputy chief euro zone economist at Capital Economics, said Friday that a similar framework for the EU might be seen as a case where a bad deal is better than no deal at all.

"Reports this week suggest that the EU and US are on the brink of agreeing a trade deal with a 15% baseline tariff on US imports from the bloc. It's hard to spin it as a good deal, but it would at least avoid much higher US tariffs and retaliation from the EU," Allen-Reynolds said in a research note.

Meta just escalated the AI talent war with OpenAI.

Shengjia Zhao, a co-creator of ChatGPT and former lead scientist at OpenAI, is joining Meta as chief scientist of its Superintelligence Labs.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Zhao's appointment on Friday in a social media post, and called him a "pioneer" in the field who has already driven several major AI breakthroughs.

Zhao previously helped build GPT-4 and led synthetic data efforts at OpenAI. According to the post, Zhao will now work directly with Zuckerberg and Meta's newly appointed chief AI officer, Alexandr Wang, the founder and CEO of Scale AI.

The new hire comes during Zuckerberg's multibillion-dollar AI spending spree, including a $15 billion investment in Scale AI and the creation of Meta Superintelligence Labs, a new division focused on foundational models and next-gen research.

In addition to Zhao, the company has lured away the three researchers who built OpenAI's Zurich office — Lucas Beyer, Alexander Kolesnikov, and Xiaohua Zhai — all of whom previously also worked at Google's DeepMind. The Superintelligence Labs team is now comprised of a lineup of names previously seen with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.

But the war for AI talent is far from over.

Databricks VP Naveen Rao likened the competition to "looking for LeBron James," estimating that fewer than 1,000 people worldwide can build frontier AI models.

Companies without the cash for massive pay packages are turning to hackathons and computing power as incentives. Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas said a Meta researcher he tried to poach told him to ask again when the company has "10,000 H100s."

AI tech workers have previously told Business Insider that Meta's Mark Zuckerberg has been emailing prospects directly and even hosting AI researchers at his home, while OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has made personal calls to potential hires.

Tech company executives have mixed feelings about Meta's poaching efforts.

"Meta right now are not at the frontier, maybe they'll they'll manage to get back on there," said Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind, on an episode of the "Lex Fridman Podcast," which aired on Friday.

"It's probably rational what they're doing from their perspective because they're behind and they need to do something," Hassabis added.

During a July 18 episode of the podcast "Uncapped with Jack Altman," OpenAI CEO Sam Altman criticised some of Meta's "giant offers" to his company's employees, and called the strategy "crazy."

"The degree to which they're focusing on money and not the work and not the mission," said Sam Altman. "I don't think that's going to set up a great culture."

Meta and OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comments.

Two flight attendants on a Southwest Airlines flight departing from Burbank, California, were injured and being treated on Friday after pilots took evasive action to avoid another aircraft, the airline said.

Southwest Flight 1496 sharply descended nearly 500 feet, according to flight tracking websites.

The airline and the Federal Aviation Administration said pilots took action after receiving alerts of a potential collision. The Southwest Boeing 737 continued on to Las Vegas, where it landed uneventfully.

The FAA is investigating.

No passengers were injured, but a passenger identified as Caitlin Burdi told Fox News Digital the sharp descent stirred panic onboard.

"We really thought we were plummeting to a plane crash," she was quoted as saying.

According to a statement from Southwest, the incident began when its crew responded to "two onboard traffic alerts" while taking off from Burbank, "requiring them to climb and descend to comply with the alerts."

The incident came a week after a SkyWest Airlines jet operating as a Delta Connection flight from Minneapolis reported taking evasive action to avoid a possible collision with a U.S. Air Force bomber during a landing approach over North Dakota.

The FAA said on Monday it was investigating last Friday's near-miss incident involving SkyWest Flight 3788, an Embraer EMBR3.SA ERJ-175 regional jet, which landed safely at Minot, North Dakota.

The Air Force confirmed a B-52 aircraft assigned to Minot Air Force Base had conducted a flyover of the North Dakota State Fair last Friday and that military investigators were looking into the matter.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

BlockDAG, ONDO, PENGU, and TAO have emerged as focal points in the cryptocurrency market, each leveraging distinct strategies to capture investor interest amid evolving industry trends. These projects, highlighted for their technological innovation, cultural resonance, and real-world utility, are reshaping perceptions of what drives success in the crypto space.  

BlockDAG (BDAG) is generating momentum through its DAG-based Layer 1 blockchain, designed to address scalability and speed challenges in traditional blockchains. With over 4,500 developers building 300+ decentralized applications (dApps) across DeFi and AI sectors, the project aims to expand to 1,000 apps by 2026. A partnership with HackerEarth underscores its developer-centric approach. The ecosystem also includes the X1 mobile app and X10 hardware miner, which increased daily BDAG output tenfold in a recent demo. Over 2 million users already engage with the X1 app, while the X10 miner begins shipping on August 15 [1]. The presale raised $353 million, with 24.3 billion BDAG sold at $0.0016. Analysts project the token could reach $1 post-launch and $5 in the future, though these figures remain speculative [1].  

Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) has transitioned from a meme-based NFT project to a global brand with tangible expansions. The token, priced low, benefits from partnerships with NASCAR and Sotheby's, as well as physical toy sales. Its social media engagement exceeds billions, and a recent ETF filing positions it to outperform other meme projects. The project's growing Asia presence and blend of “playful energy” with business strategies solidify its appeal in the best crypto coins list [1].  

Bittensor (TAO) merges AI and blockchain by creating a decentralized network for machine learning models. Unlike speculative AI-linked projects, Bittensor already demonstrates real earnings and developer activity. Its limited token supply adds scarcity, but the project's strength lies in its ability to tokenize AI computations. As decentralized AI gains traction in 2025, TAO's role in this space is seen as pivotal, combining blockchain's transparency with AI's scalability [1].  

Ondo (ONDO) focuses on tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), converting income from real estate and treasury-backed assets into token buybacks. This model attracts institutional investors seeking crypto exposure with lower volatility compared to speculative assets. As Ethereum faces congestion, Ondo's RWA-focused approach offers an alternative for long-term value creation. The project's structured buyback mechanism and partnerships with traditional financial players position it as a bridge between on-chain and off-chain markets [1].  

While all four projects show promise, BlockDAG stands out for its active ecosystem and early traction. The project's working tools, developer partnerships, and presale performance suggest it is already scaling rather than merely preparing to do so. Pudgy Penguins' brand growth, Bittensor's AI integration, and Ondo's RWA model each carve unique niches, but BlockDAG's operational momentum makes it a standout in the 2025 crypto landscape [1].

 Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have permanently reduced volatility and altered Bitcoin market dynamics, according to analysts. 

Bitcoin (BTC) will no longer experience “parabolic” price rallies or “devastating” bear markets, because BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have permanently reduced volatility and altered market dynamics, according to Blockware BTC analyst Mitchell Askew.

“BTC/USD looks like two entirely different assets before and after the ETF,” the analyst wrote on Friday. The chart he shared showed a sharp reduction in price volatility following the January 2024 launch of the Bitcoin ETF in the United States. The analyst said:

Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote that the reduced volatility has helped Bitcoin “attract even bigger fish and gives it a fighting chance to be adopted as currency.”  The tradeoff to this is that there will likely be no more “God Candles,” the analyst added.

The effects of the Bitcoin ETF on market dynamics continue to be debated by market analysts, as the investment vehicle further intertwines traditional finance, institutional investors, and digital asset markets.

Bitcoin ETFs sequester capital into traditional investment vehicles that currently lack in-kind redemption and keep funds off-chain.

This stowing away of capital can prevent the rotation into altcoins, which crypto investors have come to expect from previous market cycles.

In July, net inflows into Bitcoin ETFs crossed the $50 billion mark, though the surge of capital into Bitcoin has not translated to increased onchain activity.

Retail investors are shifting into Bitcoin ETFs and gaining exposure through traditional financial instruments held by a fund manager or another financial fiduciary on their behalf, rather than holding BTC directly, according to analysts.

The demand for paper BTC and products like BlockRock's Bitcoin ETF has led the asset manager to accumulate 3% of Bitcoin's total supply, raising concerns about centralization among some market participants.

Asphere, the enterprise division of Ankr, has officially announced the launch of Solana Permissioned Environments (SPEs), a new blockchain solution tailored specifically for enterprise use. On Friday, July 25, Ankr announced it via its official X (previously Twitter) account. This will be a significant milestone in the mainstreaming of blockchain technology in regulated sectors, as it provides fully configurable, high-performance networks deployed on the Solana blockchain.

Solana Permissioned Environments will help meet the increasing demand of businesses needing secure, scalable, and custom blockchain platforms. Asphere describes SPEs as custom blockchain networks on which enterprises can operate fully in their infrastructure and reap the benefits of Solana's performance and speed. Such environments give assurance to companies that want regulatory compliance, data privacy, and sovereignty of operations.

SPEs have multiple benefits, as they are developed in close cooperation with the Solana ecosystem. Solana boasts high transaction throughput and developer-friendly tools, which are advantageous to both developers and enterprise users. Nevertheless, as opposed to classic public blockchains, SPEs allow organizations to have control over their governance, network guidelines, validator configurations, and compliance systems. This distinctive blend renders the SPEs quite useful in the finance, gaming, healthcare, and digital media industries.

Use cases-wise, SPEs are best suited to permissioned financial networks with custom validator settings, closed execution environments, and transaction-free gas. Moreover, the product enables high-throughput decentralized apps, such as those in the gaming, social platform, and content sharing industries. SPEs are also compliance-sensitive applications and provide regulatory tooling and local infrastructure to satisfy the jurisdiction.

The key features of the SPE model include customizable network topology, support for Solana-native developer tools such as Solang and state compression, and flexible governance mechanisms. Block times, token economics, and validator logic can be customized according to enterprise business models. Besides, the enterprise compliance suite of Asphere provides integrated custody of digital assets, know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, and risk mitigation.

Asphere is the expert branch of Ankr that provides secure and scalable infrastructure to institutions and businesses. The firm aims to fill the technological divide between the established Web2 frameworks and the emerging Web3 environment. Asphere strives to enable organizations to embrace blockchain by providing products that ensure reliability, performance, and security.

Asphere relies on security as a stalwart of its services. The company was recently crowned SOC 2 certified, which shows that it has audited, secure systems. This certification means that Asphere adheres to industrial best practices in data protection, incident response, system reliability, and vendor risk management. Instead of being an occasional result, SOC 2 compliance is an action of continuous evaluation and development.

Asphere is currently completing the SOC 2 Type 2 audit to strengthen its security standards. As a result, clients and stakeholders can expect regular updates. Furthermore, the company is committed to maintaining transparency and managing system integrity and risks effectively.

Solana Permissioned Environments launch marks a significant step in the adoption of enterprise blockchain. The new service combines Solana's technical abilities and Asphere Enterprise's expertise. Further, this allows businesses worldwide to have a trustworthy, compliant, and future-ready blockchain infrastructure.

The Pudgy Penguins NFT-linked token, PENGU, has experienced a significant price surge amid renewed optimism in the NFT market and strategic collaborations expanding the project's real-world utility. Over the past 30 days, PENGU has surged 273.6%, climbing nearly 20% in a single 24-hour period as investors rotate into high-profile digital collectibles [1]. The token has broken through key Fibonacci resistance levels and exited a long-term accumulation range ($0.006–$0.021), forming a classic bullish trend with higher highs and higher lows [2]. Technical indicators, including a positive MACD flip and a strong Relative Strength Index (RSI), suggest continued upward momentum, though some analysts caution that RSI readings near overbought territory could precede a temporary cooldown [1].  

The price rally has been amplified by strategic partnerships and brand expansion. A collaboration with Lufthansa integrated Pudgy Penguins into the airline's loyalty program, while tie-ins with NASCAR have increased exposure at major racing events. Additionally, a deal with Suplay Inc. has opened access to China's multibillion-dollar collectibles market, enhancing the token's perceived utility beyond crypto [1]. These moves position Pudgy Penguins as a crossover brand rather than a niche digital asset, with its social gaming initiative, Pudgy Party, anticipated to further drive engagement.  

Whale activity has also played a role in the recent surge, with large holders driving a 17% price increase in a single day as PENGU approached its all-time high of $0.045 [4]. Analysts have drawn comparisons to PEPE's historic breakout, projecting a potential $0.24 price target for PENGU if the trajectory aligns [5]. However, this remains speculative, as the token currently trades at $0.0386, testing the $0.035–$0.0317 support zone. A successful rebound could push the token toward $0.043–$0.046, with extension levels of $0.075 or $0.097 possible if momentum builds [3].  

Retail investor enthusiasm has further fueled the rally, with PENGU's price climbing 14.3% in 24 hours and weekly gains nearing 40% amid broader meme coin speculation [8]. A spike in demand was also observed following Walmart's toy-related marketing initiatives, which linked to PENGU assets [9]. Longer-term projections, such as an average price of $0.87 by 2028, hinge on broader market conditions and adoption of NFT-related tokens [7].  

Despite the bullish outlook, risks persist. If PENGU fails to hold above critical support levels, it could retreat toward $0.023, a prior Fibonacci level. Analysts emphasize that sustained volume during key price tests will be crucial—without continued buying pressure, the rally may stall [3].  

The PENGU surge reflects a broader trend of NFT-powered tokens gaining traction during altseason, but its success in maintaining momentum will depend on balancing growth with valuation sustainability.

Fastex, a Dubai-based cryptocurrency exchange, has launched a series of collectible currency notes backed 1:1 by its native token FTN, marking what it claims is the first instance of an exchange issuing such physical-digital hybrid assets [1]. The initiative, developed over a year, combines banknote-grade anti-counterfeit features—such as serial numbers, intaglio ink, optically variable ink, and metallic security foil—with blockchain-based verification. Each note is redeemable for its full value in FTN tokens on the Fastex platform and includes an NFT that users can use to verify authenticity and access exclusive benefits like early product access, airdrops, and event invitations [1].  

The notes, designed with themes inspired by the Solar System, are produced in collaboration with Authentix, a company with over 25 years of experience in anti-counterfeit solutions. Authentix's involvement underscores the project's focus on security and authenticity, as highlighted by Joe Galloso, the firm's International Sales Director, who described the collaboration as a fusion of traditional banknote printing techniques and blockchain innovation [1]. Vakhtang Abrahamyan, Fastex's CEO, emphasized that the initiative reflects the evolution of currency, merging the tangible appeal of collectibles with the transparency and trust of blockchain technology [1].  

The notes will be available for purchase starting July 1 via Yo Cash, a platform managed by Fastex and Authentix. Users must complete a KYC (Know Your Customer) verification process before acquiring the notes, which are backed by FTN tokens and redeemable at any time. Upon redemption, the associated NFTs are burned, ensuring a one-to-one peg with the token. The initiative also aims to enhance user engagement by offering holders additional perks, including early access to new products and participation in airdrops [1].  

Fastex, which positions itself as a secure and accessible trading platform, has previously introduced services like the Bahamut EVM-based blockchain solution and the YoWallet. The exchange's leadership includes former traditional finance professionals, such as a former Deputy Chairman of a Central Bank, reflecting its strategy of bridging conventional and digital financial systems [1]. Authentix, a key partner in the project, specializes in supply chain authentication and has a 320-year collective expertise in banknote security printing, according to the company's profile [1].  

The launch of the FTN-backed notes is part of Fastex's broader strategy to innovate within the Web3 economy, leveraging physical collectibles to drive adoption of digital assets. The initiative has been promoted through interviews with Abrahamyan and Galloso, featured on platforms like Cointelegraph and News.Bitcoin.com [1].

BNB rose around 0.6% in the last 24 hours, shaking off a recent drop to now trade close to $780. At its peak, the token reached $785.75, bouncing from a low of $761.22 during a stretch of high-volume trading.

Much of the volume centered on a sharp correction, when BNB dropped from $774.52 to $761.34 on volume more than twice the daily average, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model.

That pullback, however, was short-lived. 

BNB's price traced a V-shaped recovery, ending near its high and well above the key $761 support zone. The rebound came after Windtree Therapeutics committed $520 million toward its planned BNB corporate treasury.

The purchase represents one of the largest non-crypto institutional entries into a non-bitcoin token to date. Other companies, including Nano Labs, have also been betting on BNB, whose supply has been steadily dropping over Binance's and BNB Chain's token burns.

Meanwhile, BNB Chain continues to grow its developer ecosystem. The platform announced the next cohort of its Most Valuable Builder accelerator, backing 15 early-stage startups working in AI, decentralized finance, and tokenized real-world assets.

BNB is now showing signs of consolidation as it hovers around the $780 level, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model.

Crypto crooks are getting bolder — and now, they sound just like your mom.

Global crypto scams soared 456% between May 2024 and April 2025 — becoming increasingly reliant on AI-generated voices, deepfake videos and phony credentials to fleece unsuspecting victims, blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs‘ Ari Redbord told The Post after testifying before Congress last Tuesday.

“These scams are highly effective, as the technology feels incredibly real and familiar to the victim,” Redbord said.

“We've seen cases where scammers use AI to replicate the voice of a loved one, tricking the victim into transferring money under the guise of an urgent request.”

And the threat is exploding — especially in high-density cities like New York, Miami and Los Angeles, he added.

In June, New York officials froze $300,000 in stolen cryptocurrency and seized more than 100 scam websites linked to a Vietnam-based ring that targeted Russian-speaking Brooklynites with fake Facebook investment ads.

Meta shut down over 700 Facebook accounts tied to the scam. 

Investigators say the group used deepfake BitLicense certificates and moved victims onto encrypted apps like Telegram before draining their wallets.

Some New Yorkers lost hundreds of thousands of dollars — and it's not just everyday joes getting targeted. 

Even crypto insiders are falling for it. Florida-based crypto firm MoonPay saw its CEO Ivan Soto-Wright and CFO Mouna Ammari Siala duped into wiring $250,000 in crypto to a scammer posing as Trump inauguration co-chair Steve Witkoff, according to a recent Department of Justice complaint.

And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

Globally, fraudsters swiped more than $10.7 billion in 2024 through crypto cons — including romance scams, fake trading platforms and “pig-butchering,” where scammers build fake relationships before draining victims' accounts, Redbord said. 

In the US, Americans filed nearly 150,000 crypto-related fraud complaints in 2024, with losses topping $3.9 billion, according to the FBI. But the real number is likely much higher.

“Only around 15% of victims actually report these crimes,” Redbord said, citing shame, fear and distrust in law enforcement — particularly among older adults and immigrant communities.

One of these scammers go-to tools? Crypto ATMs — especially those tucked inside New York delis and convenience stores. 

Illicit use at these kiosks is more than twice as high as in the broader crypto market, Redbord said. Victims are often directed to scan a QR code and deposit cash, instantly converting it to crypto before the funds disappear.

As the scams rage on, Washington is starting to bring order to the Wild West of crypto.

House lawmakers wrapped up “Crypto Week” last Thursday by passing the first-ever comprehensive cryptocurrency legislation — a trio of bills focused on regulating stablecoins, trading platforms and digital asset infrastructure.

Even so, Redbord advised, common sense is the best defense.

“If something feels too good to be true — especially unsolicited investment advice — it almost always is,” he said. 

“Verify the platform. Confirm identities. And when in doubt, report it — whether to IC3, Chainabuse or your local authorities.”

 A young and tech-savvy population, combating inflationary pressures, is driving Bitcoin adoption and a new financial system in Pakistan. 

Pakistan's demographics position the country as a major catalyst for Bitcoin (BTC) adoption, allowing it to “leapfrog” developed nations, according to Bilal Bin Saqib, Pakistan's state minister of crypto and blockchain.

“A global policy shift has happened, not just in Pakistan, but all around the world,” Bin Saqib told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview. The government of Pakistan moved to regulate crypto in November 2024.

The country has 40 million crypto wallets and is one of the “top five” countries in terms of crypto adoption, which the minister attributed to Pakistan's young demographic. He told Cointelegraph:

“Emerging markets are what will leapfrog the adoption of these new technologies,” the minister said, with smaller countries more likely to adopt Bitcoin due to their nimble size, allowing them to front-run developed countries. “It's easier to make a speedboat move than the Titanic,” Bin Saqib added.

Pakistan and El Salvador signed a letter of intent in July to share education and knowledge about Bitcoin, digital asset infrastructure, and energy development for crypto mining, the minister said.

“The cooperation is essentially based on how emerging economies that are both under the IMF program can leverage technology and other financial instruments for national growth,” he told Cointelegraph.

Pakistan's National Crypto Council and other regulatory bodies are seeking input on a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets, licensing crypto exchanges, developing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, launching a stablecoin, and mining Bitcoin using excess energy, the minister said.

“Pakistan has a very interesting problem. We have excess electricity, which we pay capacity charges for,” the minister told Cointelegraph. 

He said the country has up to 10,000 megawatts (MW) of excess energy, which is a “liability” due to the carrying costs of the electricity.

Bin Saqib said the country is allocating 2,000 MW for Bitcoin mining and AI data centers. The government is also exploring the potential to mine BTC with runoff energy from methane and other excess or stranded power sources, he added.

Wyoming isn't far from becoming the first U.S. state to issue its own stablecoin, moving closer to a potential showdown with Washington over how its dollar-pegged token should comply with certain restrictions signed into law last week after passage of the GENIUS Act.

The Cowboy State, which is historically suspicious of the federal government, could push back against requests to seize or freeze funds on-chain, people close to the introduction of the Wyoming Stable Token (WYST) told Decrypt, speaking as individuals.

The landmark bill requires financial institutions to issue stablecoins with “procedures to block, freeze, and reject specific or impermissible transactions,” but as a state-issued token, they say some rules may not apply to WYST, including restrictions on offering a yield.

“We are confident that we can issue yield on our stable token,” Wyoming Democratic State Senator Chris Rothfuss, who chairs the state's Select Committee on Blockchain, Financial Technology, and Digital Innovation Technology, told Decrypt. “We haven't necessarily decided that we will [enable WYST yield], but there's a lot of favorability towards it.”

The feature won't be enabled when WYST debuts later this year, but it is being implemented, Rothfuss said, noting that there are still logistical questions that lawmakers are working through. The project's main goal is to use funds generated to fund Wyoming's school system.

Rothfuss said that Wyoming lawmakers are considering other elements of the GENIUS Act, a comprehensive framework for regulating stablecoins that's expected to unlock additional participation, and competition, within the $280 billion industry dominated by Circle and Tether. 

Although the bill has been portrayed by some spectators as a stamp of approval for the crypto industry's legitimacy, some lawmakers fear that the legislation could ultimately erode Americans' financial sovereignty, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA).

“This bill regulates stablecoins and provides for the backdoor Centralized Bank Digital Currency,” she said on X last week. “This will open the door to move you to a cashless society and into digital currency that can be weaponized against you by an authoritarian government.”

CBDCs are centralized, digital versions of fiat money. Although they are similar to stablecoins, they are not issued by private companies on public networks, prompting concerns among some lawmakers, including House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN).

In March, Emmer told Decrypt that the Wyoming Stable Token amounts to a state-backed CBDC. Anthony Apollo, executive director of Wyoming's Stable Token Commission, responded by saying that WYST is an entirely different type of product. He noted, for example, that WYST is backed by U.S. Treasuries, while a government could mint a CBDC out of thin air.

In a recent interview with Decrypt, Apollo said the Commission has “the same concerns that any issuer will have about the potential nefarious use,” and it is trying to onboard blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis to monitor for illicit activity, alongside open-source intelligence firm Inca Digital.

Still, Wyoming's Select Committee on Blockchain wrote in a letter earlier this month that the Commission must “resist pressure to act as a political or financial gatekeeper,” considering “heightened standards” imposed by the United States and Wyoming Constitutions.

Apollo underscored the Commission's obligation to uphold constitutional protections as a distinct driver for WYST compared to hundreds of other stablecoins.

“We have a big delta from incumbents, who could just change their policies and say, ‘We can freeze your assets if you are trying to buy firearms,'” he said. “We have to have freeze and seize capabilities, but we can't activate those capabilities unless we have a valid court order.”

That sentiment was echoed by Rothfuss, who noted that Wyoming's ability to navigate federal requests in a nuanced way has long been viewed by the state's lawmakers as a positive.

“We are not faced with the same obligation to comply with a federal request that a corporation would be faced with,” he said. “We have sovereignty, so when the government is in opposition, [...] they can't just send us a cease and desist letter and start arresting people.”

U.S. President Donald Trump, after skewering the notion of a digital dollar on the campaign trail, signed an executive order earlier this year prohibiting federal agencies from working on CBDCs. That was despite repeated affirmations from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that the U.S. central bank isn't interested in issuing one for everyday payments.

As presidential hopefuls, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also railed against the potential dangers of CBDCs. DeSantis specifically highlighted consumer goods like red meat or gasoline.

Historically, the Cowboy State has had a complicated relationship with Washington, given that the federal government owns 48% of the state's surface land. That has led to conflicts over resources and what some Wyomingites describe as a “tall fence.”

WYST is currently undergoing a pilot program, but the token is expected to debut in August at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium, on at least one network. Current candidates include Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche, among eight other networks.

Wyoming is currently testing WYST's ability to facilitate real-time payments to government contractors using an Avalanche-based protocol developed by blockchain startup Hashfire. Hasfire CEO John Belitsky, who also serves as a subject matter advisor to the Commission, told Decrypt that other states may eventually join Wyoming, but its philosophy cannot be copied.

“Wyoming is a constitution-loving [and] legally un-opinionated state,” he said. “Other states can [launch their own tokens], but are they going to corporate with overreaching federal agencies?”

Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of the crypto exchange Gemini, claimed that JPMorgan Chase halted its onboarding process for Gemini after he criticized the bank's new fee structure for fintech companies.

Last week, Winklevoss publicly criticized JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon after Bloomberg reported the bank would start charging fintech platforms for access to customer banking data. Many of these platforms serve as bridges between traditional banks and crypto services.

“This will bankrupt fintechs that help you link your bank accounts to crypto companies,” Winklevoss posted on X. “ This is the kind of egregious regulatory capture that kills innovation, hurts the American consumer, and is bad for America.”

JPMorgan didn't address Gemini directly but defended its decision, telling Forbes that nearly 2 billion monthly requests for user data come from third parties, most of them not tied to actual customer activity.

By charging fees, the bank says it aims to curb misuse and protect consumers. In a follow-up tweet, Winklevoss said the bank told Gemini it was pausing re-onboarding the exchange.

JPMorgan had previously offboarded Gemini, as CoinDesk reported, during so-called Operation Choke Point 2.0, a period during which many crypto firms lost banking access under regulatory scrutiny.

“We will continue to call out this anti-competitive, rent-seeking behavior and immoral attempt to bankrupt fintech and crypto companies,” Winklevoss wrote.

Gemini, which filed confidentially for an IPO earlier this month, has been offering an increasing number of services that recently started including tokenized stocks.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

The cryptocurrency market is undergoing a significant shift as Bitcoin's dominance falls to 60.83%, marking a sharp decline of over 63% from previous levels. This marks the lowest level of BTC dominance in months, driven by institutional investors reallocating capital toward altcoins such as Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Ton. The altcoin market cap has surged past $1.44 trillion, signaling growing confidence in diversified crypto holdings [1]. According to data from Glassnode, Bitcoin is experiencing elevated selling pressure, with large investors (whales and institutions) offloading millions of BTC in mid-July. Daily BTC inflows to exchanges have also increased, reflecting broader capital rotation out of Bitcoin [1].  

Technical indicators further underscore Bitcoin's weakening position. The Altcoin Season Index, a leading metric for altcoin activity, has stabilized near 51, historically signaling the onset of altcoin outperformance. Ethereum, in particular, has seen consecutive price gains, rising over 27% in recent weeks, as demand for decentralized finance (DeFi) and Layer-1 blockchain ecosystems grows [1]. Analysts from Quantum Economics and Bitwise highlight that institutional strategies are increasingly favoring altcoins for higher returns in less saturated markets [1].  

AurealOne (DLUME) and DexBoss (DEBO) have emerged as top altcoin candidates. AurealOne, a Web3 gaming platform, leverages blockchain to introduce a "skill-to-earn" model, enabling users to win real crypto rewards based on performance. Its proprietary Aureal Chain emphasizes transparency and fairness, with a planned 2025 launch of over 60 games. The DLUME token is currently priced at $0.0013 [1]. DexBoss, a Solana-based crypto intelligence tool, offers real-time wallet tracking and customizable trade alerts. Its pre-sale aims to raise $50 million across 17 rounds, with the DEBO token at $0.011 [1].  

Other notable altcoins include XRP, which facilitates fast cross-border payments via the XRP Ledger, and Filecoin (FIL), a decentralized storage network underpinning Web3 infrastructure. Cardano (ADA) continues to evolve with its proof-of-stake architecture and layer-2 Hydra protocol, enhancing scalability and energy efficiency [1].  

The broader trend reflects institutional rebalancing of portfolios, with capital flowing into altcoins to capitalize on innovation in DeFi, gaming, and decentralized storage. While Bitcoin remains a key asset, its market capitalization has dipped slightly, amplifying opportunities for high-utility altcoins [1].

 XRP selling pressure could mushroom if the recent 50 billion XRP sale from a wallet linked to Ripple's Chris Larsen was "just the warm-up." 

Key points:

Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen sparks warnings to XRP investors after a wallet linked to him sends 50 million tokens to exchanges.

Larsen notionally has over 2.5 billion XRP left, which would create massive selling pressure if distributed.

XRP/USD currently trades 13% below recent all-time highs, failing to recover after the sell-off.

XRP (XRP) investors face new warnings over becoming “exit liquidity” after Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen moved 50 million tokens to exchanges.

In a response on X, J. A. Maartunn, a contributor to onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant, told XRP holders not to “get dumped on.”

XRP hit near all-time highs above $3.60 on July 17, but the achievement was quickly overshadowed by large outflows from a wallet linked to Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen.

As Cointelegraph reported, reactions on social media were mixed, with some seeing a reasonable profit-taking move and others accusing Larsen of deliberate offloading at the highs.

Continuing the topic, Maartunn warned that the wallet's giant XRP stash meant that the recent 50 million XRP outflows were merely a drop in the ocean.

Larsen, he suggested, could increase sell-side pressure by a huge factor should he choose to pull more of its balance.

“Chris Larsen (Ripple co-founder) still holds 2.58B $XRP — that's $8.83B,” he wrote. 

XRP was one of the major altcoins leading the sector's comeback this month after Bitcoin (BTC) began consolidating.

Currently at $3.18, according to Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView, XRP/USD has since corrected 13%.

“Don't get dumped on. Don't be the exit liquidity. Protect yourself,” Maartunn added.

Other popular market participants joined the concerns, including trader ManLy.

Larsen's presumed sales came as Bitcoin itself faced snap downside pressure as a Satoshi-era whale sold 80,000 BTC, which had previously been dormant for 14 years.

The transaction was handled by Galaxy Digital and briefly caused BTC/USD to drop to around $114,500 before rebounding.

During the volatility, 24-hour crypto liquidiations passed $500 million, per data from monitoring resource CoinGlass.

For a week, at least, spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds outpaced their Bitcoin counterparts.

The nine ETFs tracking ETH generated more than $1.8 billion in net inflows this week, continuing a 16-day positive streak, according to U.K. asset manager Farside Investors, as interest in the second-largest cryptocurrency mushrooms.

The 12 Bitcoin funds added just $70 million in assets over the same period, with three of the five days showing net outflows for the funds. Bitcoin has historically been on top, but this week, Ethereum dominated crypto ETF flows.

"Many [investors] own Bitcoin ETFs and are increasingly interested in diversifying," Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, a trade group, told Decrypt. "Ethereum is the second-largest digital asset, and the only other one available in [spot] ETF format—making it very easy to choose it in one's effort to improve their portfolio's diversification."

ETH ETFs' spike comes amid a price surge intertwined with the growing popularity of these funds and the rise of Ethereum treasuries. Those trends accelerated as passage of the GENIUS Act stablecoin bill neared. The legislation, which U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law last week, is expected to benefit Ethereum, the dominant platform for stablecoin transactions.


Ethereum was recently trading at about $3,745, down roughly 3% from its seven-month high set earlier this week but up more than 50% over the past month.

"Ethereum has been skyrocketing in price recently, after an extended period of underperformance compared to Bitcoin, and investors are notorious for buying assets after they've gone up in value and selling them after they've fallen—the exact opposite of what you're supposed to do," Edelman said.

BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) led this week's charge, adding $1.29 billion in investments. On Wednesday, ETHA became the third-fastest fund in the ETF industry's 32-year history to reach $10 billion in assets under management (AUM)—251 days, according to Bloomberg data. The Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) netted over $380 million in assets and has $2.3 billion in AUM, according to TradingView.

In an interview with Decrypt, Juan Leon, senior investment strategist at ETF issuer Bitwise Asset Management, said that the Ethereum funds' performance this week caps a month of gains relative to BTC ETFs.

"The ETF inflows have been closing the gap to Bitcoin significantly," Leon said. "If you look at the first week in July for the two assets where the difference in market cap is 5x, there was only a 3.5x gap between the inflows. And then the following week it narrowed further. And last week they were almost on par."

Leon believes that the ETH funds will continue their momentum at least short-term, although he expects investors to return to Bitcoin ETFs in greater numbers in the second half of the year when major "wirehouse platforms," including Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo, begin offering the latter as trading options before "greenlighting" ETH ETFs.

"That'll drive renewed flows into Bitcoin ETFs," he said. "So I'm not sure that ETH ETFs flows can continue to outperform Bitcoin's for the remainder of the year. But right now, we seem to be at least in a short-term inflection point, and irrespective of the absolute numbers, from the point of view of how big one asset is in relation to the other, ETH will continue to punch above its weight over the coming weeks and months."

For a week, at least, spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds outpaced their Bitcoin counterparts.

The nine ETFs tracking ETH generated more than $1.8 billion in net inflows this week, continuing a 16-day positive streak, according to U.K. asset manager Farside Investors, as interest in the second-largest cryptocurrency mushrooms.

The 12 Bitcoin funds added just $70 million in assets over the same period, with three of the five days showing net outflows for the funds. Bitcoin has historically been on top, but this week, Ethereum dominated crypto ETF flows.

"Many [investors] own Bitcoin ETFs and are increasingly interested in diversifying," Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, a trade group, told Decrypt. "Ethereum is the second-largest digital asset, and the only other one available in [spot] ETF format—making it very easy to choose it in one's effort to improve their portfolio's diversification."

ETH ETFs' spike comes amid a price surge intertwined with the growing popularity of these funds and the rise of Ethereum treasuries. Those trends accelerated as passage of the GENIUS Act stablecoin bill neared. The legislation, which U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law last week, is expected to benefit Ethereum, the dominant platform for stablecoin transactions.


Ethereum was recently trading at about $3,745, down roughly 3% from its seven-month high set earlier this week but up more than 50% over the past month.

"Ethereum has been skyrocketing in price recently, after an extended period of underperformance compared to Bitcoin, and investors are notorious for buying assets after they've gone up in value and selling them after they've fallen—the exact opposite of what you're supposed to do," Edelman said.

BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) led this week's charge, adding $1.29 billion in investments. On Wednesday, ETHA became the third-fastest fund in the ETF industry's 32-year history to reach $10 billion in assets under management (AUM)—251 days, according to Bloomberg data. The Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) netted over $380 million in assets and has $2.3 billion in AUM, according to TradingView.

In an interview with Decrypt, Juan Leon, senior investment strategist at ETF issuer Bitwise Asset Management, said that the Ethereum funds' performance this week caps a month of gains relative to BTC ETFs.

"The ETF inflows have been closing the gap to Bitcoin significantly," Leon said. "If you look at the first week in July for the two assets where the difference in market cap is 5x, there was only a 3.5x gap between the inflows. And then the following week it narrowed further. And last week they were almost on par."

Leon believes that the ETH funds will continue their momentum at least short-term, although he expects investors to return to Bitcoin ETFs in greater numbers in the second half of the year when major "wirehouse platforms," including Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo, begin offering the latter as trading options before "greenlighting" ETH ETFs.

"That'll drive renewed flows into Bitcoin ETFs," he said. "So I'm not sure that ETH ETFs flows can continue to outperform Bitcoin's for the remainder of the year. But right now, we seem to be at least in a short-term inflection point, and irrespective of the absolute numbers, from the point of view of how big one asset is in relation to the other, ETH will continue to punch above its weight over the coming weeks and months."

 Tyler Winklevoss claims JPMorgan paused Gemini's onboarding after he criticized the bank's data access fees, calling the move anti-competitive. 

Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss has accused JPMorgan Chase of halting the crypto exchange's onboarding process in response to his public criticism of the bank's new data access policy.

In a Friday post on X, Winklevoss claimed JPMorgan retaliated after he called out the banking giant's new move as anti-competitive behavior that could harm fintech and crypto firms.

“My tweet from last week struck a nerve. This week, JPMorgan told us that because of it they were pausing their re-onboarding of Gemini as a customer after they off-boarded us during Operation ChokePoint 2.0,” the Gemini boss wrote.

The dispute stems from a recent Bloomberg report that revealed JPMorgan's decision to charge financial technology firms for access to customer bank data — a move Winklevoss argued would “bankrupt fintechs” that facilitate crypto purchases.

Winklevoss accused JPMorgan of attempting to restrict consumers' free access to their banking data through third-party fintech platforms like Plaid. Plaid is a third-party service that helps link financial accounts to a variety of apps and online services. 

“Sorry Jamie Dimon, we're not going to stay silent. We will continue to call out this anti-competitive, rent-seeking behavior and immoral attempt to bankrupt fintech and crypto companies. We will never stop fighting for what is right!”

Gemini's relationship with JPMorgan has been rocky for years. In 2023, under the Biden administration, the bank reportedly asked the exchange to find another banking partner, citing profitability concerns.

However, Gemini denied the rumors. At the time, the exchange said that “despite reporting to the contrary, Gemini's banking relationship remains intact with JPMorgan.”

Cointelegraph reached out to both Gemini and JPMorgan for comment but had not received a response by publication.

Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss have aligned themselves politically with Trump, contributing to his past campaign and attending several White House events. The duo even had their donations to Trump's election campaign in 2024 returned after their Bitcoin donations exceeded the maximum amount allowed under federal law.

Last month, Gemini also filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The number of shares to be offered and the price range per share have not been determined.

Gemini was founded in 2014 by twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. In November 2021, it announced a fundraise of $400 million at a valuation of $7.1 billion.

Hedera's HBAR token surged nearly 12% on Friday, climbing to $0.2657 and outperforming every other top-20 cryptocurrency by daily percentage gain, according to CoinDesk Data. The rally followed an announcement by popular trading platform Robinhood that it had added support for the asset, increasing its exposure to a broad base of U.S. retail investors.

The listing sent HBAR trading volumes sharply higher, with a mid-day breakout around 12:00 UTC on July 25 pushing prices through the $0.26 mark amid more than 713 million tokens traded in a single hour. That move established the $0.26 zone as near-term resistance, though the token continued to show strong upward momentum into Saturday.

Hedera, unlike traditional blockchains, operates on a unique hashgraph consensus model that allows for high-speed, low-cost transactions at scale. It is designed to support decentralized applications, NFTs, and DeFi, and is widely known for its energy efficiency. The network's native token, HBAR, is used to pay for network services, stake for security, and incentivize node participation.

One analyst believe HBAR could have more room to run. 

On Friday, crypto analyst ChartNerd said on X that HBAR could be setting up for a major move higher — but only if it clears a key technical hurdle. Specifically, he pointed to a resistance level near $0.35, which he said aligns with something called the Supertrend indicator — a commonly used tool that helps traders identify when an asset may switch from a downtrend to an uptrend. 

According to ChartNerd, if HBAR can close above that level with strong momentum, the token could enter what traders call “price discovery” — a  stage where there are no prior highs to act as barriers. He cited Fibonacci extension levels, which are often used to estimate future price targets during strong uptrends, suggesting that HBAR could potentially rise to $1.26 or even $3.30 in a bullish scenario.

 Ether's recent surge in social media dominance signals the potential risk for a price correction, according to Santiment. 

Ether's recent price rally may be due for a cooldown, as a surge in social media mentions — reaching levels of “extreme euphoria” — points to the potential for a near term correction, according to sentiment platform Santiment.

However, other indicators suggest Ether's (ETH) rally may still have room to run, which has gained more than 50% over the past 30 days.

“Social metrics are flashing warning signs. Since early May, Ethereum's price ratio against Bitcoin has surged by an incredible 70%,” Santiment said in a report on Friday.

“This has led to extreme euphoria and a massive spike in social dominance, which is often a red flag,” Santiment added.

The sentiment platform explained that when social dominance of a cryptocurrency spikes to “unusually high levels,” it signals the asset may be overvalued. “It suggests the asset is over-hyped and the trade is becoming crowded, increasing the risk of a price correction,” Santiment explained.

Ether is trading at $3,750 at the time of publication, up 51.84% over the past 30 days, according to Nansen. However, Santiment said it is also possible that the rally is not over just yet for Ether, as other indicators suggest the market hasn't reached “peak frothiness.”

“Social dominance for memecoins is currently quite low,” Santiment said, pointing out that past market tops typically sees the opposite.

“A true marketwide top is often characterized by widespread, irrational speculation, and the absence of that could suggest this rally isn't over,” Santiment said.

Meanwhile, the recent growing corporate interest in Ether — including the recent large purchases from Sharplink Gaming and Bitmine Immersion technologies — could be the catalyst that pushes the asset to new highs, according to santiment analyst Maksim Balashevich.

Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz said on Thursday, “There's not a lot of supply of ETH, and so I think ETH probably has a chance to outperform Bitcoin in the next three to six months.”

Santiment issued a similar warning for Bitcoin (BTC) on Sunday.

Santiment analyst Brian Quinlivan said that nearly half of all crypto-related mentions on social media the previous week had centered around Bitcoin as it hit new highs, a level of dominance that may signal a local top and a potential short-term pullback.

“As Bitcoin's market value crept above $123.1K for the first time in its 17+ year history, there was an equally historic social dominance spike,” Quinlivan said.

Bitcoin BTC$118,099.24 rebounded on Friday from its overnight dip below $115,000, back to its familiar range it traded for the past two weeks.

The largest crypto recently changed hands at $117,200, still down 1.2% over the past 24 hours.

Some analysts noted the dip coincided with asset manager Galaxy moving large amount of BTC to exchanges overnight, likely related to the bitcoin whale that sent this month around $9 billion worth of BTC to trading desks. The wallets held BTC since the early years of Bitcoin's history, transferred the assets in after being dormant for more than a decade.

Later on Friday, Galaxy confirmed that it completed the sale of all 80,000 BTC on behalf of a client, touting it as "one of the largest notional bitcoin transactions in the history of crypto."

The sale was part of the investor's estate planning strategy, the firm said.

With the selling pressure by the whale now past, some analysts predicted the lows could be in or close.

John Glover, chief investment officer of crypto lender Ledn, said that BTC could put in a local bottom on Friday or over the weekend before continuing its push to new records, according to his Eliot wave analysis.

"Once completed (either today or over the weekend) I expect that we will complete wave iii by rallying to circa $132,000," Glover said in a market note.

Researchers investigating atomic-scale phenomena impacting next-generation electronic and quantum devices have captured the first microscopy images of atomic thermal vibrations, revealing a new type of motion that could reshape the design of quantum technologies and ultrathin electronics.

Yichao Zhang, an assistant professor in the University of Maryland Department of Materials Science and Engineering, has developed an electron microscopy technique to directly image "moiré phasons" -- a physical phenomenon that impacts superconductivity and heat conduction in two-dimensional materials for next-generation electronic and quantum devices. A paper about the research, which documents images of the thermal vibration of individual atoms for the first time, published July 24 in the journal Science. (See video link below.)

Two-dimensional materials, which are sheet-like structures a few nanometers thick, are being explored as new components of next-generation quantum and electronic devices. A feature in twisted two-dimensional materials are "moiré phasons," critical to understanding the materials' thermal conductivity, electronic behavior, and structural order. Previously, moiré phasons were difficult to detect experimentally, preventing further understanding of the materials that could revolutionize quantum technologies and energy-efficient electronics.

Zhang's research team took on this challenge by using a new technique called "electron ptychography," which achieved the highest resolution documented (better than 15 picometer) and detected blurring of individual atoms caused by thermal vibrations. Her work has revealed that spatially localized moiré phasons dominate thermal vibrations of twisted two-dimensional materials, which fundamentally reshaped how scientists understand its impact.

The breakthrough study, which confirmed the longstanding theoretical predictions of moiré phasons, also demonstrated that "electron ptychography" can be used to map thermal vibrations with atomic precision for the first time -- which was previously an experimental capability out of reach.

"This is like decoding a hidden language of atomic motion," said Zhang. "Electron ptychography lets us see these subtle vibrations directly. Now we have a powerful new method to explore previously hidden physics, which will accelerate discoveries in two dimensional quantum materials."

Zhang's research team will next focus on resolving how thermal vibrations are affected by defects and interfaces in quantum and electronic materials. Controlling the thermal vibration behavior of these materials could enable the design of novel devices with tailored thermal, electronic, and optical properties -- paving the way for advances in quantum computing, energy-efficient electronics, and nanoscale sensors.

At San Diego Comic-Con, HBO Max unveiled a new trailer for the second season of DC Studios' series, Peacemaker, starring John Cena.

The brand-new Peacemaker trailer arrives two months after DC Studios teased fans with an initial teaser. In the teaser trailer, we saw Peacemaker being interrogated by Maxwell Lord (Sean Gunn), Guy Gardner (Nathan Fillion), and Hawk Girl (Isabela Merced). Peacemaker's cameo in Superman, DC Studios' summer blockbuster, highlights his role as DC Studios' resident anti-hero and serves as a connection between the original and rebooted cinematic universes. This unique position places him in an interesting limbo that the upcoming second season appears eager to explore.

Although the world may not recognize them as genuine heroes—likely overshadowed by the headline-grabbing heroism of Smallville's caped superhero—Peacemaker and his gang have a mountain of trouble ahead that they need to sort out. Mostly caused by Chris himself deciding to see how the other half lives… the other half being a whole other dimension where Peacemaker is a way more popular hero.

Key among those issues aside from that is Peacemaker's long-awaited confrontation with Rick Flag Sr. (Frank Grillo) on account of killing his son in The Suicide Squad and a confrontation with himself, literally, when the other Peacemaker discovers that Chris is mooching off of his life and dimension. That just goes to show that folks have to stop messing around with pocket universes. Listen to Mr. Terrific!

The forthcoming second season of Peacemaker was announced in February of 2022. At the time, and especially following the cataclysmic conclusion of Superman, its positioning as DC Studios' next big thing raises several questions about how it'll address what director, writer, and DC Studios head James Gunn will carry over from its first season and what won't. Fortunately, Gunn provided some insight into what fans can expect ahead of Peacemaker's second season and how its hero's pocket universe gate compares to Lex Luthor's.

“Lex's version is much jankier than the one in Peacemaker. The one in Peacemaker works better. What the whole season of Peacemaker revolves around is that,” Gunn told Entertainment Weekly.

He continued: “I think of Peacemaker as more of a high-concept story about one other world. It's more akin to Philip Roth's [1996 novel] The Counterlife than it is to the third Spider-Man movie [2021's No Way Home]… I love that movie, but it isn't about that. It isn't Deadpool & Wolverine. It's really a very simple, simple story about [Chris'] relationship to this one other world.”

Fans can look forward to finding out firsthand what lies in store when Peacemaker season two premieres on HBO Max on August 21.

Some of the tests you list (like A1C) are baseline things everyone should get checked every year. Agreed that the others could provide value for those who want to know more about their risk level; however, it's uncommon for those tests to turn up positives without one of the baselines having already raised at least a yellow flag.None of the tests you listed will tell you whether you have any soft plaque buildup. They just tell you more about your risk factors. However, there are ultrasound tests that can detect increased blood pressure in major arteries, which IIRC does reflect soft plaque buildup.

These tests don't have perfect accuracy and resolution, so low or zero results don't mean that a lifetime of high cholesterol won't catch up with someone in their 60s and 70s, yet a lot of podcasters and social media influencers are making those claims.

A ketogenic diet is 70% fat.It's literally impossible to get into keto with a diet of leafy greens and salmon. You would have to augment with a lot of fat from some other source and also limit salmon intake to avoid consuming too much protein. Salmon has too much protein and not enough fat to even come close to keto ratios.You must be thinking of a different diet. A lot of people think keto is another word for low carb, but a real keto diet is very low carb and low protein.

If you do try keto again, bacon and such are the worst way to do it. Getting your fat content from a monounsaturated source like avocado oil can be helpful. Taking statins is also a good idea.

The other problem is that they're picking and choosing which tests to believe and which to ignore.They disregard their cholesterol tests because they don't like the results, but embrace one or two CAC tests because they do like the results (when they're young).However the CAC results are a lagging indicator of cumulative damage that has been done. Cholesterol tests are correlated with the rate of damage occurring.So embracing CAC and using it to justify ignoring LDL and others is the problem.

The downside, of course, is that once the damage is done, it's done, so it's a risk. (And as you said, they won't see the damage in their 20s.)

If you're old: Great! Keep an eye on cholesterol.CAC is a lagging indicator. Its usefulness is more about assessing damage done, not rate of change or future risk.

My experience is, your total cholesterol is over 200 (with some more specifics about LDL I can't recall, like 130 or something), all doctors everywhere will then hound you incessantly to get on Crestor, immediately.   Diet and exercise don't matter (they cite research showing it doesn't make a difference).  Whether you have plaque or not isn't considered, you need to be on Crestor right now to prevent it from starting anyway.My cholesterol started really going up in my late 40s and I can concur an aggressive change to my diet where I significantly reduced my saturated fat intake and I lost about 20 pounds made absolutely no difference, and my total cholesterol started hitting 300, so I'm on the Crestor.  My initial dose did cause me to have elevated liver enzymes and my total cholesterol went to about 170 in about a month, so I'm on an extremely low dose on alternating days.

Star Trek faces an uncertain future at the moment, as shows that helped define its streaming renaissance end one by one, and little is known about what lies on the horizon (especially thanks to current events in our own world). So it's perhaps fitting, then, that the one new show we do know is coming is all about welcoming a new generation back to Star Trek‘s fundamental ideals after a similar period of uncertainty: Starfleet Academy.

To close out today's packed Hall H panel at San Diego Comic-Con, Paramount released the first trailer for Star Trek: Starfleet Academy. Set in the 32nd century after the events of Star Trek: Discovery, the series will follow the first new class of cadets to enroll at the titular academy in San Francisco in over a century, as the Federation rebuilds and reconnects after the cataclysmic events of “The Burn” from Discovery‘s third season.

The new trailer, aside from being packed with references to all of Star Trek history (from Academy wing names to courses on figures like Captain Sisko), introduces us to a whole host of new and familiar faces as classes begin. The series will be led by Holly Hunter, who plays Nahla Ake, the captain of the U.S.S. Athena, a long-lived half-Lanthanite (the same humanoid species as Strange New Worlds‘ Commander Pelia, played by Carol Kane) who also serves as the Academy's chancellor.

Among the senior staff at the academy, she'll be joined by Discovery‘s Tig Notaro and Voyager‘s Robert Picardo, reprising their roles as Jett Reno and the Emergency Medical Hologram simply known as the Doctor, respectively—they'll also be joined in a guest star capacity by Discovery‘s Mary Wiseman and Oded Fehr as Sylvia Tilly and Admiral Vance, respectively. One new addition to the campus staff is Gina Yashere's Lura Thok, the Athena‘s first officer as well as Starfleet Academy's cadet master—fascinatingly, a half-Klingon, half-Jem'Hadar, the genetically engineered footsoldiers of the Dominion from Deep Space Nine.

Of course, an academy needs students, and Starfleet Academy will follow a whole host of new recruits making their way through training. Here's the rundown:

Even if Starfleet Academy is a school-set series, Star Trek still needs a baddie, and the show will have one in the form of Paul Giamatti, cheekily and mysteriously introduced at the end of the trailer. Giamatti plays Nus Braka, a seedy gang leader (and himself another half-Klingon, this time a Klingon/Tellarite hybrid) who has some ominous connections to one of the new cadets at the academy.

The first season of Starfleet Academy is set to begin streaming on Paramount+ in early 2026. The show has already been renewed for a second season.

After spending the past week-plus in the headlines due to a seemingly inescapable social media scandal, data operations startup Astronomer is trying to shift the narrative with a tongue-in-cheek video starring actress and entrepreneur Gwyneth Paltrow.

Paltrow was, of course, previously married to Coldplay singer Chris Martin. And it was at a Coldplay concert in Massachusetts that the company's CEO Andy Byron and Chief People Officer Kristin Cabot were apparently caught dancing together on the “kiss cam.”

When Byron and Cabot (who are reportedly married to other people) awkwardly tried to hide from the camera, Martin joked, “Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy.”

Footage of the exchange exploded in popularity, ultimately leading both executives to resign from Astronomer. In announcing Byron's resignation, the company said, “Our leaders are expected to set the standard in both conduct and accountability, and recently, that standard was not met.”

Astronomer's statement also nodded at the fact that the company had suddenly become famous for reasons having nothing to do with its product: “While awareness of our company may have changed overnight, our product and our work for our customers have not.”

Its new marketing video has a similar message, attempting to refocus the conversation on Astronomer's technology, while winkingly acknowledging why that might be a challenge.

Paltrow kicks things off by introducing herself as someone who's been “hired on a very temporary basis to speak on behalf of the 300-plus employers at Astronomer.” She then promises to answer the “most common” questions asked about the company — but when the briefly glimpsed, half-typed questions are all about you-know-what, Paltrow remains cheerfully, and resolutely, on-message.

“We've been thrilled so many people have a newfound interest in data workflow automation,” she says. Paltrow even finds time to plug the company's upcoming conference before concluding, “We will now be returning to what we do best — delivering game-changing results for our customers.”

N1X's got some beefy Arms.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Nvidia's long-rumored and long-delayed N1X SoC has broken cover once again, this time revealing its GPU capabilities through a fresh Geekbench OpenCL listing. We've seen various CPU-focused leaks surrounding this chip before, but this provides our first genuine look at the GPU. That being said, this isn't final silicon—it's an early engineering sample—but the details are enough to show where Nvidia is headed with its first consumer-class ARM SoC for laptops and possibly desktops.

The Geekbench entry confirms a 20-core CPU setup split into two 10-core clusters, built on Nvidia's Grace architecture. More importantly, it confirms 48 Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs), translating to 6,144 CUDA cores—the exact count as the desktop GeForce RTX 5070. Interestingly, these specs also match Nvidia's GB10 Superchip, which currently powers the DGX Spark AI mini-PCs, suggesting that N1X might be a repurposed, possibly lower-power version aimed at the mainstream market. After all, they're both ARM-based chips developed in unison with MediaTek.

Performance, however, is still in the rough. This sample clocked in at a modest 1.05 GHz and scored 46,361 in OpenCL, roughly in the territory of the RTX 2050. The reason is power and frequency limits, which are typical of early prototypes, as well as the absence of dedicated GDDR memory, since the SoC relies on shared LPDDR5X.



Even in this state, the N1X's iGPU is already outpacing every modern integrated GPU, including Apple's M3 Max and AMD's 890M, which top out at around 37,500 in similar benchmarks. The GPU performance ceiling is higher, given that a fully powered RTX 5070 boosts to 2.5 GHz with a 250W TDP, while the N1X is capped at around 120W for the entire chip.

This isn't the first time the N1X has appeared on Geekbench. Earlier leaks revealed its CPU performance was competitive but not earth-shattering, which is to be expected from unfinished drivers and firmware. With the latest listing, Nvidia is signaling a hybrid approach: pairing a Blackwell GPU core array with an ARM-based CPU cluster, aiming for a balance of AI performance, gaming, and efficiency—similar to how AMD's Strix Halo and Apple's M-series chips are positioned.

There's still no launch date in sight. Rumors suggest a Q1 2026 release, possibly timed to coincide with the next wave of AI-focused Windows laptops, as Microsoft appears to be holding up on that at the moment. For now, Nvidia's N1X sits in the shadows, a prototype with the specs of a mid-tier discrete GPU and ambitions to push iGPU performance into uncharted territory.

If Nvidia gives this chip the power and bandwidth it needs, the N1X could be the first ARM-based SoC to seriously challenge x86 giants like AMD and Intel on high-performance laptops—and maybe even take a bite out of Apple's lead in the premium AI laptop segment.

As ITHome reported, China is pushing its domestic GPU efforts into uncharted territory with Lisuan Tech's first consumer and professional graphics cards, the 7G106 and 7G105.

Built on TSMC's 6nm N6 process, the 7G106 and 7G105 are powered by the company's in-house TrueGPU architecture and aim to compete directly with mid-range offerings from Nvidia and AMD. While the spotlight is on gaming performance, Lisuan is positioning these chips as multi-purpose accelerators for AI, cloud rendering, and even metaverse applications.

The consumer-focused 7G106 features 12 GB of GDDR6 memory on a 192-bit bus, 192 texture units, 96 ROPs, and an FP32 throughput of up to 24 TFLOP/s. It features four DisplayPort 1.4 outputs with DSC 1.2b compression and supports DirectX 12 (minus ray tracing), Vulkan 1.3, OpenGL 4.6, and OpenCL 3.0. Its single 8-pin PCIe connector also suggests a TDP of around 225W.

On the other hand, the professional 7G105 doubles memory to 24 GB with ECC, offering up to 192 GB/s of pixel fill rate, 384 GB/s of texture fill rate, and the same 24 TFLOP/s compute ceiling. Both cards include hardware-accelerated AV1 and HEVC decode up to 8K60 and encode capabilities at 8K30 for HEVC and 4K30 for AV1.

What sets Lisuan apart from past Chinese GPU attempts is its claim of building the TrueGPU architecture from scratch, including the instruction set, compute core, and software stack. The company touts "intelligent multitasking" with up to 48 concurrent tasks, out-of-order triangle rendering for 50% faster efficiency in certain scenes, and dual FP32/INT32 instruction emission.

There's also a unique matrix memory layout designed to boost memory efficiency by 40%, along with dynamic load balancing that distributes rendering and compute tasks across cores in real time. Lisuan even claims NRSS, a proprietary rendering quality optimization system designed to rival Nvidia DLSS and AMD FSR.

Benchmark results paint a mixed but promising picture. In synthetic tests, the 7G106 scored 26,800 points in 3DMark Fire Strike and 2,256 in Steel Nomad, putting it roughly on par with Nvidia's RTX 4060 in Fire Strike. Geekbench 6 OpenCL saw it notch 111,290 points, edging out the RTX 4060 by around 10%.

Gaming demos were equally noteworthy: Black Myth: Wukong and Wuchang: Fallen Feathers both ran at over 70 FPS in 4K High settings, while Shadow of the Tomb Raider topped 80 FPS under similar conditions. High-profile titles like these running on a GPU architecture in its infancy paint a very positive picture for the platform's stability, more so than raw performance numbers.

The 7G105 professional variant leans heavily on AI and enterprise markets, supporting SR-IOV virtualization with up to 16 containers. Lisuan highlights its applicability for cloud gaming, digital twins, virtual reality, and even robotics. The company claims its eXtreme series cards are ready to handle large AI models such as DeepSeek and Wenshengtu, extending their utility beyond traditional PC gaming.

Lisuan's announcement marks a new phase for China's domestic GPU ambitions. While past efforts, such as Zhaoxin's integrated solutions and Moore Threads' early discrete GPUs, struggled to break into the mainstream, Lisuan's 6nm designs represent a bold attempt to close the gap with global players. If its claims of architectural independence and performance parity hold up under independent testing, this could be the first time a Chinese GPU maker truly competes with AMD and Nvidia in the discrete GPU space.

Mass production of the Lisuan 7G106 and 7G105 is expected to begin in September 2025, following sampling in August. Pricing and final clock speeds are yet to be announced. Still, Lisuan's domestic-first strategy could make these cards a viable alternative for Chinese gamers and enterprises facing rising costs and export restrictions.

We can't complain about the lackluster clips used for this $12.50 fashion accessory.

A silicon enthusiast is taking their obsession to another level by marketing a new line of CPU jewelry. The decorative wearable trinkets we spotted this week are based around Apple Silicon. In the main picture, and the source Tweet below, you can see a collection of nearly 20 Apple M1 SoCs that are set to be transformed into hair clips.

Twitter/X-based @YuuKi_AnS, probably better known for their contributions to the silicon rumor mill, including various high-profile leaks, is the creator behind these upcoming Apple M1 Pro hair clips. The Goofish link in the Tweet doesn't provide any further images, so what you see above is all we have to get a feel for this new fashion line.

After examining the image in detail, it appears that Yuuki_Ans has already converted about half of their M1 Pro samples into hair clips. You can see 10 of the chips, on the left, seemingly propped up by a colorful hair clip-style assembly affixed to their undersides.

You may think that the hair clip assembly, with its plastic appearance, doesn't offer the premium build to match the Apple M1 Pro's technical pedigree. However, at a list price of 90 Chinese Yuan (about $12.50), it is hard to grumble about what you get.

According to the Goofish retail site, seven of these hair clips are already reserved. If you want one and have access to this marketplace, moving with haste is recommended.

We have covered the interesting and sometimes provocative crossover between tech and fashion many times over the years. Back in 2010, we covered electronic component-based earrings, PCB-based Christmas decorations, and many more ways creators have recycled or upcycled old computer parts. RGB LEDs also have strong crossover potential between technology and fashion.

More recently, we covered the launch of the ultimate fashion accessory to advertise your conspicuous consumption - GPU Purses. Much more affordable, yet more charming, were the WinRAR Messenger bags that we reported on this June.

However, we note that CPU jewelry has its roots dating back to 1994. According to Chipsetc, Intel had a brainwave promotional idea, to sell off flawed Pentium chips as “earrings, pins, link bracelets, cuff links, and even Pentium keychains.”

It is noted that these bejazzled chips were a result of serious production losses from the Intel fabs. Please don't confuse them with the infamous Floating Point Division bug processors, which were sold to unsuspecting customers until the end of the same year (1994).

This week on the GeekWire Podcast, my guest is Brad Anderson — a former Microsoft corporate vice president who spent more than 17 years at the Redmond company. For nearly five years, he has been with Qualtrics, where he's president of products, user experience, engineering, and security.

I've known Brad for a while. In fact I've been a guest on two of his shows back when he was a leader in enterprise mobility and cloud technology at Microsoft, when it was all the rage for executives to have their own video shows. 

There was “Lunch Break with Brad Anderson,” where he drove his guests around the streets of Redmond in his Tesla. And there was “The Ship Room,” where he talked about the cloud transformation and played games with guests, challenging me to distinguish real startups from fake ones. 

Qualtrics, the experience management technology company, has dual headquarters in Seattle and Provo, Utah. Once publicly traded, it was acquired in a private equity deal in 2023.

For this week's show, I went to the Qualtrics Tower in Seattle to talk with Brad about how he thinks about building tech today, and how AI agents are changing the experiences the company creates and measures. He also discussed the importance of security in the AI era. (Qualtrics announced a key security milestone this week.)

In the final segment, I turned the tables on Brad with a game about cloud and AI terms called “Real or Ridiculous” (see below). Listen to the end to play along. 

But first, he reminded me about the random case of mistaken identity that brought us together in the first place, back in the day.

Listen to the episode to hear the story, and continue reading for highlights from his comments, edited for context and clarity. 

On the unprecedented pace of AI innovation: “My team sends out a summary of what changed in the last seven days every single Monday to the engineering team, because it's moving that fast. I've never seen anything like that.”

How AI is transforming customer feedback: “Worldwide right now, when someone starts a survey, the completion rate is 75%. … With our Gen AI enabled surveys, what we call conversational feedback, it increases to 83%. … When we ask the follow-up question, we get 30 times the number of words back in the second response. And so with generative AI, we've been able to increase the amount of data coming back by 10%, and double the quality.”

On AI's impact on engineering productivity: “What we're seeing right now is, Cursor is literally generating millions of lines of new code for us. Of course, it's AI generated, human-reviewed, human approved, human corrected. But 45% of all that code that's being generated, we're checking into the product.”

The changing shape of engineering organizations: “I think, as an industry, there will be fewer entry level [positions]. If a typical pyramid for an engineering organization is that 20%, 15% of their engineers are entry level, that probably goes down by 3% to 5% over the next couple years.”

On trust as the key to AI success: “If you ask yourself the question, who are going to be the organizations that are going to thrive in this world of AI, I would argue it's going to be the organizations that business leaders trust.”

On using AI to accelerate decision-making: “I've spent hours and hours inside of ChatGPT just asking questions such as, ‘Hey, if you were the president of a 1,500-person organization with revenue in the multiple billions … what would you do if you wanted to significantly increase the capabilities and the skill set of the engineering team in AI? … It may not have all the answers, but boy, it puts things in your mind, it gives you ideas.”

And here's the quiz that I gave Brad in the final segment, which I created with help from ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini. Listen to the show to hear the answers.

Are these cloud and AI buzzwords real industry terms, or just expertly crafted nonsense?

Real or ridiculous? Listen to the final segment to play along and hear the answers.

Ioannina, a lakeside town in northern Greece surrounded by mountains, is not the kind of place you expect to find cutting-edge artificial intelligence quietly reshaping medicine. Yet, inside its main public hospital, Dr. Tzimas is doing just that.

Dr. Tzimas is quietly reshaping how medicine is practiced. From spotting rare diseases like Q fever to managing conflicts among junior doctors, Dr. Tzimas has woven AI into the rhythm of daily medical life.

However, he believes that AI will not be able to replace the essential human interactions that are at the heart of his work. “You have to listen to lung sounds, palpate the abdomen, look patients into their eyes,” he says. “AI can't feel pain responses or smell signs of illness.”

Dr. Tzimas is the director of the Internal Medicine Department at General Hospital of Ioannina “G. Hatzikosta.”

This interview is part of our series How Do You Use AI?, where we ask people one simple question: How do you use AI? No TED Talk nonsense, just real life.

Episode 3: Dr. Thomas Tzimas—AI Pragmatist.

Gizmodo: How does AI fit into your daily medical practice?

Dr. Tzimas: AI acts as an assistant that helps us work faster and more reliably. We feed it solid data, review the output, and proceed if it's okay. This is particularly helpful when we need to respond to insurance companies about a patient's situation or send emails to family physicians.

Gizmodo: Can you give a specific example of how AI assists with patient care?

Dr. Tzimas: One major area is drug interactions. There are extensive tables of drug interactions, but they're difficult to access quickly when you're with a patient. AI systems can provide this information very easily and without mistakes. It also helps with adjusting dosages for patients with conditions like renal insufficiency or hepatic failure, where normal doses might be harmful.

Gizmodo: Are you concerned about AI “hallucinations” or inaccuracies in the medical field?

Dr. Tzimas: An experienced clinician can spot hallucinations right away. If you prompt the AI with very strict protocols, they do not hallucinate. The “temperature” setting of AI models is crucial; for the medical field, it needs to be set to 0.3, which makes them very strict and prevents them from fantasizing or hallucinating. Normal AI systems often have a temperature of 1, which leads to a lot of fantasizing and hallucinating.

Gizmodo: Do you use AI for personal matters?

Dr. Tzimas: I use AI for almost all my emails, especially within the communication platform among doctors. I use a “negotiator GPT” prompt that makes answers very diplomatic. This is particularly useful when there's a conflict among junior doctors, as I have to maintain integrity and prevent conflicts while still being strict. It helps me reply in a way that smooths over potential issues, like an accomplished diplomat would.

Gizmodo: Interesting…

Dr. Tzimas: I also use AI to create teaching materials very quickly. For instance, I can take a complex clinical case from a journal like the New England Journal of Medicine and ask the system to create multiple-choice questions from it. I then present these questions to the doctors, and I can see who answers correctly or incorrectly. The next day, I provided the correct answer. AI also helps me summarize large articles and complex medical cases from journals for easier discussion. This has freed up a lot of my time.

Gizmodo: Does AI assist with diagnosis?

Dr. Tzimas: AI tools are really capable for differential diagnosis. If a patient presents with a symptom like fever, it could be a thousand things. With AI, we can narrow down the possibilities to less than 10, and then through clinical examination, imaging, and consultations, we narrow it down to one. The system can even remind you of really rare conditions that might be happening to your patient.

Gizmodo: When was the last time AI helped you in a case?

Dr. Tzimas: A few hours ago, we completed a difficult case. One patient, a labor worker, had inhaled a lot of dust in a sheep and goat stable and came in with a fever. We used AI to consider what diseases could be contracted from dust in such a stable. One of the highly-ranked differential diagnoses was Q fever, which is very rare. We sent a blood sample to Athens to exclude it. Although it came back negative and the final diagnosis was unrelated, the AI system identified Q fever as a potential possibility, which opened our horizons. Without AI, Q fever might not have even on our list.

Gizmodo: Do your patients use AI themselves?

Dr. Tzimas: Yes, some patients now use AI, similar to how they used to Google their symptoms. They might come in saying, “This is what ChatGPT said,” and we have to respond to that. As AI spreads, people with health questions will use it to get analyses of their symptoms. Our job as doctors remains the same: to professionally answer questions and provide credible answers and solutions. This means doctors also need to use AI for support, paperwork, and even creating dietary plans for patients.

Gizomo: Does AI replace the need for administrative staff, like a personal assistant?

Dr. Tzimas: It reduces the need. For example, my previous boss would write notes on paper for his assistant to type. Now, I dictate notes on my iPhone, copy-paste them into an AI system, and it creates a nice email. Also, I can take pictures of paper documents, and AI can transcribe them into a digital form, saving tons of time and creating digital archives.

Gizmodo: Are you worried about AI replacing you?

Dr. Tzimas: No, not at all. My job involves experience that AI cannot yet replicate. I need to listen to lung, heart, and bowel sounds, palpate patients, and inspect them. While AI might analyze a digital photograph of a skin lesion, it cannot palpate a patient and feel the intensity of pain or guarding. These are qualities that rely on a doctor's senses, like smelling a patient's breath to detect diabetic ketoacidosis. Human interaction, like looking a patient in the eyes, observing their demeanor, and assessing their hygiene, provides crucial information that AI cannot easily replace. AI helps save time, but it needs an experienced physician to input those essential details.

Gizmodo: How does AI affect your work-life balance?

Dr. Tzimas: It saves time. Preparing teaching material used to take me hours; now I just spend an hour or a couple of hours and I'm ready. So I have more time for my personal life.

This handheld console packs a punch.

Famed handheld gaming PC maker GPD has just teased the Win 5, the latest generation of its top-of-the-line handheld console, which features the powerful AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395. Although we didn't see much in the video, thankfully, the YouTube channel The Phawx (PhawxTV) provided more details, revealing hardware specifications and a massive 80Wh external, removable battery.

This move counters the trend of incorporating built-in batteries into everything, allowing you to swap batteries when you run out of power easily. It's also better for repairability, as you can just easily purchase a compatible battery from GPD and replace the old one in your system when it no longer works as expected.

Its spec sheet also says that the battery is backpack mountable (probably like mounting on the back of the console) or wired charging (which feels like it can be used as a power bank). This means you can place the battery on a desk and attach it to the console via cable, thereby reducing the weight you carry during those long gaming sessions.

Aside from the Ryzen AI Max+ 395, you can also get the Win 5 with the less potent AMD Ryzen AI Max 385. This cheaper version has half the cores and threads of the more powerful chip, but should still be enough for the average handheld gamer.

You can also configure the console's memory from 32GB to 128GB, ensuring you'll have enough RAM for both the CPU and the integrated GPU. It only has one M.2 NVMe 2280 slot, but you can choose between 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB configurations, ensuring you won't run out of storage for all the titles you plan to add to it.

A few gamers were worried that the GPD Win 5 would inherit its predecessor's smaller 6-inch display. Thankfully, it now features a 7-inch 120 Hz display with 1080p resolution and 10-point touch control. It's also protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 6, which is already somewhat outdated, as it was introduced in 2018. Still, it's better than nothing, and you're not supposed to stash it in your bag or pocket without a case.

We're excited to see the GPD Win 5, which is supposed to be revealed at ChinaJoy 2025 on August 1. Hopefully, it will become available at a relatively affordable price, giving gamers a next-generation console.

Nearly a month ago, a mysterious object was seen hurtling through the solar system and later confirmed as an interstellar visitor traveling toward the Sun. Several telescopes have since turned their attention to the wandering object, but it turns out the brand-new Vera C. Rubin Observatory was the first to catch a glimpse of 3I/ATLAS.

In an act of cosmic serendipity, astronomers pointed the Rubin Observatory toward the patch of sky where the interstellar object appeared during its commissioning phase. Images captured by the observatory, perched atop a mountain in the Chilean Andes, later revealed the comet in its full glory. Rubin's observations of 3I/ATLAS were recorded on June 21, around 10 days before its official discovery, according to a recent paper available on the preprint website arXiv.

The Rubin Observatory, overseen by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of Energy (DOE), boasts the largest digital camera ever built for astronomy. Its car-sized, 3.2-gigapixel camera is designed to capture ultra-high-definition images and videos of the cosmos. The observatory unveiled its first images to the public on June 23, observing millions of galaxies and stars in the Milky Way over a period of just 10 hours. The images were not only beautiful—they also revealed supernovas and distant galaxies that could help astronomers study the universe's expansion.

With its revolutionary precision, it's no wonder then that the Rubin Observatory captured the recently discovered comet before any other telescope. 3I/ATLAS was first spotted in data collected by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) between June 25 and 29, and again on July 1. By July 2, the Deep Random Survey remote telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, had seen it too. The International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center confirmed that this comet came from outside our solar system on July 2, marking the third discovery of an interstellar object.

Since then, astronomers have been rushing to gather as much data as they can on the mysterious object. The Gemini North telescope on Maunakea, Hawaii, recently snapped a close-up view of 3I/ATLAS, capturing the comet's coma in extreme detail. Initial observations of 3I/ATLAS suggest it's the oldest comet ever found, around 2 billion years older than our solar system. Compared to the two previously discovered interstellar objects, ‘Oumuamua and Comet 2I/Borisov, 3I/ATLAS is not only older, but it's also faster. A recent study, which has yet to undergo peer review, found that 3I/ATLAS has a hyperbolic velocity of about 37 miles per second (60 kilometers per second).

Rubin's early observations of 3I/ATLAS are important considering they are the earliest images captured of the comet by a high-precision telescope. The new paper includes 49 images in total, although some were excluded because they were captured during Rubin's alignment sequence and were out of focus. Nineteen of the images were captured during intentional operations and confirm that 3I/ATLAS does in fact behave like a comet, with a cloud of gas and dust surrounding its icy nucleus, according to the paper.

Just as it was the first to spot the comet, Rubin will also be the first to lose sight of it. On August 22, 3I/ATLAS will shift out of the area in the sky currently being watched by the observatory. Until then, the astronomers behind the paper will keep an eye out for the interstellar visitor in Rubin's images.

The creators of the popular card game “Taco vs. Burrito” — dreamed up by a Seattle 7-year-old in 2018 — are exiting with a significant win.

Hot Taco Inc., the company behind the game, sold the “Taco vs. Burrito” assets to Wisconsin-based toy and game company PlayMonster, ending a run that started with a little boy and his mom talking about how to make a game during their walks to a coffee shop.

“It's been such a fun ride. It's kind of crazy to think back to it being an idea for my son, and then all of a sudden we've sold a million copies of the game,” Leslie Pierson told GeekWire this week as she recounted the journey she had with her son Alex, now a 15-year-old high schooler.

Pierson said she, her husband Mark Butler, and Alex have always been a big game family. From a young age, Alex liked to learn new games and talk about what he liked and what he didn't.

According to Pierson, her son knew he wanted to create a new game called “Taco vs. Burrito,” and he knew he wanted to launch it with a Kickstarter campaign. How to make and play it was determined over several months of conversations on their walks.

“I really did think it was just gonna be a chat about how a product gets made,” Pierson said. But after six months they were still playing paper iterations of the game, improving on it, and falling in love with it.

An inventor and serial entrepreneur, Pierson had experience in product development. She created GoodHangups and launched the magnetic poster-hanging product via Kickstarter before landing on “Shark Tank” and making a deal with Lori Greiner on that hit show.

But Pierson was not a game developer. She credits Alex with the inspiration and creation of the “Taco vs. Burrito” gameplay — and for coming up with something that quickly made $25,000 on Kickstarter.

Pierson was already a big believer in Amazon, where she was selling GoodHangups.

“The thing I love about Amazon is the fact that you don't have to have a warehouse, you don't have anything,” she said. “You can just get your product there and then sell it. You don't have a big team, you don't have to support a big retailer or anything like that.”

Alex's game sold out on the e-commerce site in a week and Pierson knew, “there's something here.” The game and the fact that it was made by a kid resonated with families and others who enjoyed the strategic play.

“We've sold over a million and a half games in the past six years, and it just became amazing to do,” Pierson said, noting that it was regularly a top-ranked offering in Amazon's games category.

But the time to sell became apparent.

Pierson said the sweet spot for any business she runs is the first five years, where she could still handle the surge in popularity and demand with the help of one other employee. Pierson wasn't interested in hiring a big team or developing new versions of the game to sell more products to existing customers. She was tired of getting ready for the holiday rush, or another Prime Day.

The uncertainty around President Trump's shifting tariff policies didn't help either.

“Every day, Trump wakes up and has a new idea of tariffs — it's gonna be this, it's gonna be this, it's gonna be this,” Pierson said. “And I was just like, ‘I'm done.' This isn't the phase I love. I surely don't love not knowing what the cost of something is.”

And Alex's passion as a teen had pivoted from card games to video games.

Pierson fielded pitches from a number of different companies, and called PlayMonster's the best, saying they really got the brand and had concepts for future versions of the game. Rather than hold onto a stake in “Taco vs. Burrito” with a royalty in perpetuity, they opted for more cash now. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

As they fold their cards on “Taco vs. Burrito,” Pierson takes pleasure in knowing they provided quality entertainment for families, away from phones and modern digital distractions. Board and card games always brought her family together, and she's glad it worked for others.

“It's been a really good experience,” Pierson said. “And I love that Alex had that experience of creating something, so that if he has an idea in the future, anything's possible.”

GM's EVs have been on a roll lately. After selling just the Chevy Bolt for years, a wave of new models — now up to 17 fully electrified vehicles — has pushed the automaker into second place in the U.S. behind Tesla. 

How did it get there? With a little help from a Tesla veteran.

GM board member Jon McNeil was president of Tesla during the development and introduction of the Model 3, a crucial period of the company's growth. One of the things he credits for Tesla's success is how Elon Musk ran product meetings. 

“No slides was our first rule,” McNeil told the audience earlier this month at TC All Stage in Boston. “You have to be reviewing real product.”

Every week, senior leadership would sit down with product leaders to review their progress. The practice was inspired by an encounter Musk had with Steve Jobs, McNeil said. 

“There was this belief that I think is true: Steve Jobs didn't have a ton of time or patience for Elon in the early days. And early in the early days, Elon would try to chase Steve down at events and parties in Silicon Valley for advice. And Steve didn't like Elon, and so would often turn his back to him when he approached him. 

“But one night, Elon got lucky and said, ‘Steve, if you had one piece of advice for me as a young entrepreneur' — he had just just done PayPal and was joining the team at Tesla — ‘what would that be?' Steve said, ‘Elon, you're now in the hardware business, but the hardware business is a lot like the software business. If you want to be successful in business, you have to get one thing right, and that is, you have to have a perfect product. And if the product is beautiful, it will sell itself.”

Musk took that to heart, McNeil said, and the concept of a perfect product became central to product development at Tesla.

“The thing we were looking for first of all was surprise and delight. Like, are we doing something that is going to just make somebody go wow or laugh or have fun? 

“Crazy example of that is the fart button,” McNeil said, referring to a software button labeled “Emissions Testing Mode” that would simulate flatulence through the car's speakers. 

The company also prized minimalism, which on the software side meant keeping functions accessible in fewer than two taps on the screen. 

“It has to be a kind of a no brainer for the average user. Then we would double back the designer — the lead designer was always in the room — and then we would say, OK, Franz, now make it beautiful.”

Meetings like those, where the actual product was reviewed, not a mockup, helped preserve Tesla's culture as it grew, McNeil said. “You can imagine the culture that gets communicated when people are bringing their A game to the CEO every week. Because you're not going to bring your B game to the CEO — especially that CEO, because he's going to fire you,” he said.

“That keeps that company on a one-week cadence of innovation. Every week they're making progress because of the product reviews.”

McNeil left Tesla in early 2018. In 2022, he was added to the board at GM. 

“One of the things I'm most proud of is Mary Barra, CEO, and Mark Reuss, president, [who oversee] a 275,000 person, $200 billion revenue company, are running product reviews every week where there's no slides. You've got to see the real product [whether it's] hardware, software. If it's hardware, it's in the room. You're touching it. You're feeling it,” he said.

“That stuff is so powerful. And it's led to GMs introduction of 17 EVs, now the second best selling EVs in the country. Because they're just on product, every week.”

U.S. insurance giant Allianz Life has confirmed to TechCrunch that hackers stole the personal information of the “majority” of its customers, financial professionals, and employees during a mid-July data breach.

When reached by TechCrunch, Allianz Life spokesperson Brett Weinberg confirmed the breach.

“On July 16, 2025, a malicious threat actor gained access to a third-party, cloud-based CRM system used by Allianz Life,” referring to a customer relationship management (CRM) database containing information on its customers. “The threat actor was able to obtain personally identifiable data related to the majority of Allianz Life's customers, financial professionals, and select Allianz Life employees, using a social engineering technique,” the spokesperson said.

The company disclosed the data breach on Saturday in a legally required filing with Maine's attorney general, but did not immediately provide a number of how many Allianz Life customers are affected. According to the spokesperson, Allianz Life has 1.4 million customers. Its parent company, Allianz, has more than 125 million customers worldwide.

Allianz Life said it notified the FBI, and added it had “no evidence” that any other systems on its network were compromised. 

The insurance giant would not say if it had received any communication from the hackers, such as a ransom note. The company also would not attribute the breach to a hacking group. 

Allianz Life is the latest company in the past month to have been hacked during a wave of data breaches targeting the wider insurance industry, including Aflac, a major provider of supplementary health insurance. Security researchers at Google said in June that they were “aware of multiple intrusions” across the insurance sector attributed to Scattered Spider, a collective of hackers and techniques that rely on social engineering techniques, such as deceptively calling and tricking helpdesks into granting them access to a company's network. 

Prior to targeting insurance companies, the Scattered Spider hackers were seen targeting the U.K. retail industry, as well as the aviation and transportation sectors, and are historically known for hacks targeting Silicon Valley technology giants.

Per the Maine filing, Allianz plans to begin notifying affected individuals around August 1.

Nemo's Osmo tents have long been WIRED favorites. The proprietary, hybrid Osmo fabric is a blend of nylon and polyester, with dual coatings (silicone on the outside, poly on the inside) that offer the weatherproofing of polyester with much of the durability of nylon. The Osmo Dagger we reviewed several years ago is still going strong.

Earlier this year Nemo revamped the entire Dagger Osmo tent to be fully Bluesign compliant (previously just the fabric was). It now offers slightly more headroom, thanks to a pole redesign. The new model is also $30 cheaper.

Nemo's Osmo fabric first arrived in 2022 after two years of research, development, and testing. Where most tents are either nylon or polyester, Osmo is a proprietary blend of both. Nemo's product development director, Gabriel Rosenbrien, told WIRED in that one of the company's goals with Osmo was to find a way to overcome the stretching of nylon (which absorbs water and sags), while also avoiding the downsides of polyester—namely, that it's not quite a strong as nylon.

This is bit of an oversimplification. Factors such as the coating used, the density and type of weave, and other design choices make comparing nylon and polyester something of an apples-to-oranges prospect. In general, both nylon and polyester have strengths and weaknesses. Osmo is Nemo's attempt to pull in the strengths of both while avoiding the weaknesses, and I think the company has succeeded.

I have spent 25 nights now in the previous model and a week in the new one, including one of the heaviest rains I've ever experienced, and I've found Osmo to be plenty durable and great at shedding the rain.

Coming in at just under 4 pounds, the Dagger is on the heavy side for what it is, but split between two people the weight is acceptable for what you get. This is an especially livable backcountry tent that's roomier than most.

At 88 inches long and 50 inches wide, there's just room for two 25-inch sleeping pads, something you won't pull off with most ultralight tents. Lengthwise, I had plenty of room without touching the ends with my bag hood or footbox. I'm 5' 11", but anyone up to about 6'3" would likely be fine. Another nice aspect is that the foot end of the tent doesn't taper inward, which means even at your feet your bag has almost no contact with the sides, making it easier to avoid any condensation.

There hasn't been much condensation in my experience, though. There's plenty of mesh at the top (which is also great for staring up at the stars on those clear nights when you don't need the fly), which allows for plenty of airflow. Even on some humid Midwestern nights, condensation coming off the rainfly was not an issue. The Osmo fabric's polyester content also ensures that the there is very little sag, even after wet nights.

Another aspect that makes the Dagger feel roomy are the very steep sidewalls, which are pretty much vertical thanks to the mid-center cross pole. As part of the 2025 redesign, the interior height is now 43 inches. This is the tallest freestanding tent that I'm aware of, beating the Big Agnes Copper Spur UL2 ($408), which tops out at 40 inches, and Nemo's Hornet 2P ($450) which, while lighter, is also only 40 inches tall.

Unchanged from last year is the nice, deep bathtub floor, which comes up about 6 inches, offering good protection from rain back-splash and any runoff from pitching your tent in the wrong place. If you're selecting your pitch site well, this shouldn't happen, but sometimes circumstances intervene and it's dark or you're the last person to the group site and don't have first pick.

If you look at the photos, you'll notice that the rainfly arcs up at each end of the tent. This saves a bit on weight and improves ventilation, but it was one area that worried me when I reviewed the 3-person version years ago. Thankfully this has never been an issue, the bathtub floor (which is what is exposed below the fly) has proved plenty waterproof in my use.

Speaking of bathtub floors, there is a clip-in vestibule floor that's also a bathtub shape. Nemo calls this the Landing Zone. It's a little extra triangle of fabric that covers about half the vestibule and protects any gear you've stored there from back-splash and any water that might come under the fly. There are stays in the rainfly to help it maintain its bathtub shape.

The Landing Zone weighs next to nothing (1.7 ounces) and makes the vestibule much more usable, keeping your gear dry even if the ground gets wet. It's a nice feature I've come to appreciate on rainy days.

What I really like about Nemo's tents over other options, like the Copper Spur tents, is the attention to detail. The Landing Zone, the ceiling headlamp pocket (which turn your headlight into a lantern, complete with reddish light), the quick clip fly attachment, the fact that the near vertical sidewalls mean the doors can use a straight zipper (which you can open with one hand), the nice hooks that allow you to roll the vestibule and inner doors out of the way … all adds up to a living experience that trumps most other tents I've tested.

There are a couple of trade-offs here. The big one is weight. This is not the tent for ultralight backpackers, thru-hikers, or anyone looking for a very low-weight, minimalist structure. If that's you, look to tarps and non-freestanding tents like the Lunar Solo. Again, though, split between two people, I think a 4-pound tent like the Dagger is perfectly acceptable.

The other trade-off: The Nemo is toward the high end of the price spectrum. In my experience, the combination of high quality materials, durability, and attention to detail make the Dagger Osmo 2P worth the investment.

The future of self-driving cars in Italy it seems needs not only technology but also (possibly above all) political backing. The good news, then, is that more than 60 mayors in Italy have decided to take the field for the cars of the future.

On July 14, in the hall of the MEET Digital Culture Center in Milan, Pierfrancesco Maran, a member of the European Parliament for the Italian Democratic Party, launched the Autonomous Driving: Italy in the Front Row initiative, which has backing from administrators from all over the country.

Among the signatories to the scheme are Milan mayor Beppe Sala and Turin mayor Stefano Lo Russo, as well as dozens of other mayors of medium-size and small cities. The goal, apparently, is to make Italy the European leader in autonomous vehicles, turning municipal territories into open-air laboratories for testing the automotive technologies of the near future.

The initiative stems from the realization that Europe lags dramatically behind the United States and China. While Waymo fulfills more than 250,000 paid rides a week in the four US cities where it operates, and China has established 20 pilot cities with more than 74 million miles of accumulated testing, Europe is limited to 400 highly fragmented micro-projects—of which less than half are nationwide.

The gap is not only geographical. In the United States and China, private individuals and companies invest billions, while in Europe, public funds are dispersed over initiatives that are too small. Europe's regulatory fragmentation, with 27 different national frameworks (including differing traffic laws, for example), also makes it impossible to exploit any advantage of the region being a single continental market.

Italian administrators see autonomous driving as a practical solution to everyday urban problems, such as last-mile urban logistics and reducing traffic and pollution in city centers. Extending the right to mobility for the elderly, disabled, and children is also a priority shared by many administrators in the country, as is the use of autonomous vehicles to better connect suburban areas poorly served by public transportation.

But the path to implementation in the region turns out to be more complex than initially imagined, with challenges that go far beyond the technical aspects. For example, the collective mayors' enthusiasm clashes with an inadequate regulatory framework. Italy's new highway code, approved in December 2024, with focuses on new rules for electric scooters, zero tolerance for those driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs, and phone use while driving, has missed an opportunity to bring Italy in line with modern times and positions the country as one of "the last of the old century instead of the first of the new," according to Maran.

Insurance companies still do not cover self-driving cars for public service in Italy, while European approval procedures severely limit the number of vehicles a manufacturer can put on the market. Bureaucracy slows any experimentation: Even to test a simple delivery robot seems to require "going to Mars," said Milan's councillor for mobility Arianna Censi.

The discussion at the Milan conference brought out different visions of the future of autonomous driving in Europe. Giorgio Gori, another European Parliament member for the Italian Democratic Party, stated that Europe risks repeating the same mistakes made with cloud computing and artificial intelligence, areas where the continent has lagged behind due to regulatory fragmentation and a lack of large corporate players. "We're not good at manufacturing, but from a utilization and grounding perspective we would be great," Gori said, suggesting that perhaps Europe should focus on applying technologies developed elsewhere rather than trying to reign in global competition.

Benedetta Scuderi, a European Parliament member for the environmentally focused Italian Europa Verde party, rejects the idea of surrendering to the technological supremacy of the United States and China, and insisted on the need to find spaces where Europe can excel, identifying strategic niches in line with the continent's sustainability goals.

"We need to think in both research and production where autonomous driving can create added value for Europe and Italy," he said, pointing out that non-European players are not necessarily looking in the direction of more efficient and less impactful mobility. The European strategy, according to Scuderi, must focus on development models that favor vehicle sharing over private ownership, countering the US trend toward individual car ownership.

The Italian mayors' call represents a bet on the future of European mobility that must come to terms with complex geopolitical realities. And the time challenge is crucial: As each month of delay widens the gap with competitors investing billions, Europe must decide whether to focus on technological self-sufficiency or on the smart integration of solutions developed elsewhere. Waymo operates more than 1,500 vehicles in four US cities, while Volkswagen Group's Moia operating in Hamburg and Munich in Germany (as well as in Austin, Texas) has only 100 autonomous vehicles for testing purposes.

Success will depend on turning the policy debate into concrete actions that involve public and private investment, simplify regulations, and convince citizens that autonomous driving is an opportunity and not a threat. The 60 Italian mayors who have signed on to this autonomous driving initiative show that this technology has some political backing. However, it should be noted that there are just under 8,000 Italian municipalities.

Maran feels that what is needed is the kind of quantum leap only a coordinated European strategy can guarantee. “This is not about technology that will arrive tomorrow,” he said, "but about a revolution already underway that Europe cannot afford to suffer passively."

Amazon has acquired Bee, a relatively new AI company that debuted an always-listening wearable earlier this year. Bee cofounder Maria de Lourdes Zollo shared the news via LinkedIn.

We covered Bee AI at CES 2025—it was one of many new wearables that promised to listen to everything around you. It didn't save audio recordings, but it used the power of third-party and in-house large language models to transcribe words and create a journal of sorts, offering insights into your day, crafting takeaways, actionable tasks, and summaries of conversations.

Despite being one of the first on the scene with its Alexa voice assistant, Amazon has been trailing behind the likes of OpenAI and Google's Gemini in the AI space, only recently debuting the upgraded version of Alexa+, powered by LLMs. The Bee acquisition would let Amazon offer its customers a different kind of AI experience from Alexa, one that is with you wherever you are and is always listening. That raises several privacy concerns, and Amazon has historically had a poor track record on that front.

We'll have to wait and see whether Bee's current privacy policies will shift under the new ownership, and what will become of the little yellow wearable.

Nothing's sub-brand CMF has a new smartwatch, following up on last year's Watch Pro 2. It's called the Watch 3 Pro, which is a subtle shift in the naming convention that makes it more similar to the CMF Phone 2 Pro that debuted a few months ago. The price is also now $99. Even with the $30 price bump, it's still one of the cheapest smartwatches around, though it runs RTOS (real-time operating system), meaning you won't be able to access your favorite apps here.

That trade-off lets the Watch 3 Pro purportedly last 13 days on a single charge, a slight bump over its predecessor (the new watch lasts 4.5 days if you have the always-on display enabled). There's a new dual-band GPS for more accurate route tracking, 131 sport modes with a personalized running coach, and a new heart-rate sensor that CMF claims is more accurate across workout intensities and skin tones. Naturally, there's a dose of “AI-powered” post-workout summaries.

The CMF Watch 3 Pro can now track blood oxygen levels and stress, and it offers guided breathing exercises to help you relax. It even has period tracking. That's almost all the typical health features found on more full-featured smartwatches, save the electrocardiogram and fall detection. You'll be able to see basic notifications on the watch, and there's now a ChatGPT integration that lets you talk to the chatbot and set reminders, though your phone will need to be nearby for processing.

It's available in dark gray, light gray, and orange, with a metal body and soft-touch silicone straps. CMF says all of its smartwatches are now transitioning to the Nothing X app, the same app used to configure Nothing's audio products. There's support for Apple Health, Strava, and Google Health Connect, so your data will show up in those respective platforms. It officially went on sale July 22, though some regions will have to wait until later this year.

Microsoft has announced a new Surface Laptop with an integrated 5G cellular modem, which will use Verizon's 5G network. Although it looks nearly identical to the current Surface Laptop 13.8 (7th Edition), it uses a new “custom multi-layered laminate” material on the exterior rather than aluminum, which Microsoft says “allows radio signals to pass through without impacting performance,” according to the company's blog post. Microsoft also boasts that it has completely redesigned the Surface Laptop to “thoughtfully” and “strategically” integrate the antenna inside to reduce interference.

All the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:

The new device is targeted toward business users, but it's an interesting reversal to the severe lack of cellular laptops recently. Microsoft has been offering a 5G option of the 2-in-1 Surface Pro for a while now, but never a Surface Laptop. When 5G was first rolling out in 2019, laptops with integrated 5G cellular connections were starting to roll out, such as the Lenovo Yoga 5G in 2020. But interest died out pretty fast. Perhaps Covid killed the momentum, since people were at home with their stable Wi-Fi connections. Or maybe it was because the Qualcomm Snapdragon-powered laptops at that time really couldn't compete with Intel.

Interestingly, because it's an enterprise device, the Surface Laptop 5G is actually powered by an Intel Core Ultra Series 2 rather than Qualcomm's Snapdragon X. Microsoft may also be trying to preempt Apple's move into cellular MacBooks. It was reported late last year that Apple was exploring the idea, having acquired Intel's 5G modem business back in 2019.

The Surface Laptop 5G will be available starting on August 26, with a starting price of $1,800 for an Intel Core Ultra 5, 16 GB of RAM, and 256 GB of storage. —Luke Larsen

That's the question posed by Palmer Luckey this week. The pro-Trump tech entrepreneur has already stamped his footprint in the worlds of virtual reality through Oculus and military tech through Anduril, but a more conventional computer would be new ground for Luckey. He raised the provocative question at the Reindustrialize 2025 Summit earlier this week.

“I actually think Anduril could build computers in the United States,” he stated. “I've looked into it very, very deeply. I've had conversations with everyone you would need to do this. On the chip side, on the assembly side, on the manufacturing side. I know exactly how to do it, what it would cost, how long it would take.”

Luckey goes on to say that the only thing holding him back is that he hopes someone else does it first. He later posted the following question on X: “Would you buy a Made In America computer from Anduril for 20% more than Chinese-manufactured options from Apple?” At the time of writing, 64 percent of the over 77,000 responses said yes, while the rest said no.

Whether or not there will be Anduril laptops in the future isn't so interesting as the larger question of how much it would cost to build technology from the ground up without relying on foreign production. The way his question is stated implies that he doesn't just mean laptops that are assembled in the US, but actually devices where every component is made in the US. If we trust Luckey in his price estimation, that would mean a MacBook Air–like device would cost an extra $200. That's less than what analysts have said in the past, including one approximation that stated iPhones would cost at least 25 percent more due to increased labor costs alone. Others have put that estimate much higher—as high as $3,500 for an iPhone, or stated that it's altogether impossible due to supply chain limitations. —Luke Larsen

Google Photos officially rolled out a feature this week that lets you convert static images to videos using generative artificial intelligence. We first saw this capability on an Honor smartphone, but it's now becoming more widely available. Google says the feature is powered by its Veo 2 generative AI model. All you need to do is select the image from your gallery and choose “Subtle movements” or “I'm feeling lucky,” and it'll get animated into a six-second clip (of something that never happened).

That's not all that's new. The company is also adding a feature called Remix, which lets you convert existing photos into art styles, like anime, comics, and 3D animations (remember Prisma?). It'll be rolling out over the next few weeks. All of these effects and features might feel a little much, especially considering all the other tools at your disposal in the app, which is why Google also has a new Create tab. This is where you can go to convert photos to videos, use Remix, create collages, highlight videos, and more. The tab will be rolling out in August.

Google's Wear OS 6 update started rolling out this week—it's the latest version of the smartwatch operating system, introducing a more colorful interface, widgets that are even more glanceable, alongside power efficiency improvements for better battery life. One of the oldest watch face apps, Facer—which has hundreds of themed watch face designs across various platforms—has announced an update adding compatibility with Wear OS 6. That's big news, considering that the app lost compatibility after Wear OS 5 rolled out in 2024.

Facer didn't support Google's Watch Face Format (WFF) when Wear OS 5 launched, which was mandatory to access watch face complications. The company had to work with Google to bring back full functionality of its watch faces to Wear OS 6, and the it even says Facer will deliver “significantly improved battery life” on all faces.

The Facer update also adds new collaborations, like a SpongeBob SquarePants watch face, as well as a social component called “Looks.” It's a tab in the app that lets you show off your favorite watch faces. Think of it as a new way to discover watch faces outside of the app's general explore page. If you like a look, you can find out what watch face they're using and download it, and if you like their watch strap, Facer will point you to its own strap store so you can nab it.

Photo filter and editing app VSCO—yes, the very same that popularized the “VSCO girl”—has been around since 2012, but the company just launched a stand-alone mobile app after a decade. Capture is an iPhone-only camera app that has more than 50 “live presets” with real-time film effects and manual camera settings for better control over the final image. It essentially lets you preview the final look of your photo before you even hit the shutter button.

These presets are non-destructive, so you can still edit the original captured image later on if you decide to change things up. It supports RAW and ProRAW formats, has real-time effects like bloom, and can instantly sync with the VSCO app for additional edits or sharing. It's free to download now, and there's no word if an Android app will be available in the future.

Millions suffering from myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), a debilitating condition often overlooked due to the lack of diagnostic tools, may be closer to personalized care, according to new research that shows how the disease disrupts interactions between the microbiome, immune system, and metabolism.

The findings-potentially relevant to long COVID due to its similarity with ME/CFS-come from data on 249 individuals analyzed using a new artificial intelligence (AI) platform that identifies disease biomarkers from stool, blood, and other routine lab tests.

"Our study achieved 90% accuracy in distinguishing individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome, which is significant because doctors currently lack reliable biomarkers for diagnosis. Some physicians doubt it as a real disease due to the absence of clear laboratory markers, sometimes attributing it to psychological factors."

 Dr. Derya Unutmaz, Study Author and Professor, Immunology, The Jackson Laboratory 

The research was led by Dr. Julia Oh, formerly at JAX and now a microbiologist and professor at Duke University, in collaboration with ME/CFS clinicians Lucinda Bateman and Suzanne Vernon of the Bateman Horne Center, and Unutmaz, who directs the JAX ME/CFS Collaborative Research Center. Details appear today in Nature Medicine.

Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterized by severe symptoms that significantly impair physical and mental activities, including persistent fatigue, sleep abnormalities, dizziness, and chronic pain.

Experts often compare ME/CFS to long COVID, as both conditions frequently follow viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus. In the United States, ME/CFS affects between 836,000 and 3.3 million individuals- many undiagnosed-and costs the economy $18 to $51 billion annually due to healthcare expenditures and lost productivity, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Prior studies have noted immune disruptions in ME/CFS, Unutmaz said. This new research builds upon those findings by investigating how the gut microbiome, its metabolites, and immune responses interact. The team linked these connections to 12 classes of patient-reported symptoms, which were aggregated from hundreds of datapoints generated by patient health and lifestyle surveys.

These include sleep disturbances, headaches, fatigue, dizziness, and other symptoms the researchers mapped in their entirety from microbiome changes to metabolites, immune responses, and clinical symptoms.

"We integrated clinical symptoms with cutting-edge omics technologies to identify new biomarkers of ME/CFS," Oh said. "Linking symptoms at this level is crucial, because ME/CFS is highly variable. Patients experience a wide range of symptoms that differ in severity and duration, and current methods can't fully capture that complexity." 

To conduct the study, the researchers analyzed comprehensive data collected from the Bateman Horne Center, a leading ME/CFS, Long-Covid, and fibromyalgia research center in Salt Lake City, Utah. Dr. Ruoyun Xiong, also a lead author on the study, developed a deep neural network model called BioMapAI. The tool integrates gut metagenomics, plasma metabolomics, immune cell profiles, blood test data, and clinical symptoms from 153 patients and 96 healthy individuals over four years.

Immune cell analysis proved most accurate in predicting symptom severity, while microbiome data best predicted gastrointestinal, emotional, and sleep disturbances. The model connected thousands of patient data points, reconstructing symptoms such as pain and gastrointestinal issues, among several others. It also revealed that patients who were ill for less than four years had fewer disrupted networks than those who were ill for more than ten years.

"Our data indicate these biological disruptions become more entrenched over time," Unutmaz said. "That doesn't mean longer-duration ME/CFS can't be reversed, but it may be more challenging."

The study included 96 age- and gender-matched healthy controls, showing balanced microbiome-metabolite-immune interactions, in contrast to significant disruptions in ME/CFS patients linked to fatigue, pain, emotional regulation issues, and sleep disorders.

ME/CFS patients also had lower levels of butyrate, a beneficial fatty acid produced in the gut, along with other nutrients essential for metabolism, inflammation control, and energy. Patients with elevated levels of tryptophan, benzoate, and other markers indicated a microbial imbalance. Heightened inflammatory responses, particularly involving MAIT cells sensitive to gut microbial health, were also observed.

"MAIT cells bridge gut health to broader immune functions, and their disruption alongside butyrate and tryptophan pathways, normally anti-inflammatory, suggests a profound imbalance," said Unutmaz.

Even though the findings require further validation, they significantly advance scientists' understanding of ME/CFS and provide clearer hypotheses for future research, the authors said.

Since animal models can't fully reflect the complex neurological, physiological, immune, and other system disruptions seen in ME/CFS, Oh said it will be crucial to study humans directly to identify modifiable factors and develop targeted treatments.

"The microbiome and metabolome are dynamic,"Oh said. "That means we may be able to intervene-through diet, lifestyle, or targeted therapies-in ways that genomic data alone can't offer."

BioMapAI also achieved roughly 80% accuracy in external data sets, confirming key biomarkers identified in the original group. This consistency across diverse data was striking, the authors said.

"Despite diverse data collection methods, common disease signatures emerged in fatty acids, immune markers, and metabolites," Oh said. "That tells us this is not random. This is real biological dysregulation."

The researchers intend to share their dataset broadly with BioMapAI, which supports analyses across diverse symptoms and diseases, effectively integrating multi-omics data that are difficult to replicate in animal models.

"Our goal is to build a detailed map of how the immune system interacts with gut bacteria and the chemicals they produce," Oh said. "By connecting these dots we can start to understand what's driving the disease and pave the way for genuinely precise medicine that has long been out of reach."

A new artificial intelligence model can improve the process of drug and vaccine discovery by predicting how efficiently specific mRNA sequences will produce proteins, both generally and in various cell types. The new advance, developed through an academic-industrial partnership between The University of Texas at Austin and Sanofi, helps predict how much protein cells will produce, which can minimize the need for trial-and-error experimentation, accelerating the next generation of mRNA therapeutics.

Messenger RNA (mRNA) contains instructions for which proteins to make and how to make them, enabling our bodies to grow and carry out the day-to-day processes of life. Among the most promising areas of health and medicine, the ability to develop new mRNA vaccines and drugs - able to fight viruses, cancers and genetic disorders - involves the frequently challenging process of coaxing cells in a patient's body to produce enough protein from therapeutic mRNA to effectively combat disease. 

The new model, called RiboNN, stands to guide the design of new mRNA-based therapeutics by illuminating what will yield the highest amount of a protein or better target specific parts of the body such as the heart or liver. The team described their model today in one of two related papers in the journal Nature Biotechnology.

"When we started this project over six years ago, there was no obvious application. We were curious whether cells coordinate which mRNAs they produce and how efficiently they are translated into proteins. That is the value of curiosity-driven research. It builds the foundation for advances like RiboNN, which only become possible much later."

Can Cenik, Associate professor, Molecular Biosciences, University of Texas, Austin

The work was made possible by funding support from the National Institutes of Health, The Welch Foundation and the Lonestar6 supercomputer at UT's Texas Advanced Computing Center.

In tests spanning more than 140 human and mouse cell types, RiboNN was about twice as accurate at predicting translation efficiency as earlier approaches. This advance may lend researchers the ability to make predictions in cells in ways that could help expedite treatments for cancer and infectious and hereditary diseases. 

You can think of the way cells in your body make proteins as the way a team of chefs might bake cakes. To cook up a batch of proteins, the chefs in one of your cells (ribosomes) look up the recipe in your own unique protein cookbook (a.k.a. DNA), copy the recipe onto notecards called messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and then combine ingredients (amino acids) according to the recipe to bake up the cakes (proteins).

An mRNA vaccine or therapeutic coaxes these chefs in your cells into making proteins. In the case of a vaccine, they might produce a protein found on the surface of a pathogenic virus or cancer cells, essentially waving a big red flag in front of your immune system to make antibodies against the virus or cancer. In the case of a disorder caused by a genetic mutation, they might produce a protein that your body can't properly make on its own, reversing the disorder.

Before developing their new predictive model, Cenik and the UT team first curated a set of publicly available data from over 10,000 experiments measuring how efficiently different mRNAs are translated into proteins in different human and mouse cell types. Once they had created this training dataset, AI and machine learning experts from UT and Sanofi came together to develop RiboNN.

One goal of the predictive tool is to one day make therapies that are targeted to a particular cell type, said Cenik, who also is affiliate faculty at UT's Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences and a CPRIT scholar, receiving research support from the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas.

"Maybe you need a next-generation therapy to be made in the liver or the lung or in immune cells," he said. "This opens up an opportunity to change the mRNA sequence to increase the production of that protein in that cell type."

In a companion paper also in Nature Biotechnology, the team demonstrated that mRNAs with related biological functions are translated into proteins at similar levels across different cell types. Scientists have long known that the process of transcribing genes with related functions into mRNAs is coordinated, but it hadn't been previously shown that translating mRNAs into proteins is also coordinated.

A potential target for experimental drugs that block PRMT5 - a naturally occurring enzyme some tumors rely more on for survival - has been identified by researchers with the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute's Cancer Research Center in Washington, D.C.

In a study published this month in Cancer Research, Assistant Professor Kathleen Mulvaney of Virginia Tech's Fralin Biomedical Research Institute shared research that could help guide development of new therapies for some treatment-resistant lung, brain, and pancreatic cancers.

"Using genetic screening, we found a new drug combination that seemingly works."

Kathleen Mulvaney, Assistant Professor, Fralin Biomedical Research Institute, Virginia Tech

New therapies are needed. Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death globally. The five-year survival rate is less than 15 percent for pancreatic cancer patients, and even lower for glioblastoma. 

"With one drug alone, tumors can become resistant really quickly," said Mulvaney, who is a member of the research institute's Cancer Research Center in Washington, D.C. Treatment often fails. The findings suggest the PRMT5 inhibitor could be a powerful new approach for certain hard-to-treat cancers. "In all cases, the combination is better at killing than the single agents."

Many of these solid tumors share a genetic trait: They lack CDKN2A and MTAP, two genes that suppress tumors and help regulate cell growth. Without them, the cancers become dependent on PRMT5 and potentially vulnerable to drugs that block the enzyme.

Mulvaney and colleagues analyzed genetic data from thousands of cancer patients available through the cBioPortal.

They applied CRISPR editing tools to look at biological pathways across a range of samples to determine which genes make cancer cells more vulnerable to PRMT5 inhibitors and which combinations could improve response and long-term outcomes.

An estimated 5 percent of all cancer patients - about 80,000 to 100,000 per year in the U.S. - can benefit from the therapies identified, according to Mulvaney, who also holds an appointment in biomedical sciences and pathobiology in the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine.

Using PRMT5 inhibitors with drugs that block a communication system that tells cancer cells when to grow, divide, or shut down - known as the MAP kinase pathway - scientists identified potential treatments for clinical trials. 

"We also discovered a number of genes that interact with PRMT5 signaling in cancer that were not previously known," Mulvaney said.

In addition to lung, brain, and pancreatic cancers, the treatment shows promise for some types of melanoma and mesothelioma.

In both animal models and cell cultures derived from patient tissue, lab members saw success after testing potential therapies. 

"In all cases, the combination is better at killing cancer cells than the single agents," Mulvaney said. "Only the combinations led to complete regressions."

As artificial intelligence is rapidly developing and becoming a growing presence in healthcare communication, a new study addresses a concern that large language models (LLMs) can reinforce harmful stereotypes by using stigmatizing language.

The study from researchers at Mass General Brigham found that more than 35% of responses in answers related to alcohol- and substance use-related conditions contained stigmatizing language. But the researchers also highlight that targeted prompts can be used to substantially reduce stigmatizing language in the LLMs' answers. Results are published in The Journal of Addiction Medicine. 

"Using patient-centered language can build trust and improve patient engagement and outcomes. It tells patients we care about them and want to help. Stigmatizing language, even through LLMs, may make patients feel judged and could cause a loss of trust in clinicians."

Wei Zhang, MD, PhD, Study Corresponding Author and Assistant Professor, Division of Gastroenterology, Mass General Hospital

LLM responses are generated from everyday language, which often includes biased or harmful language towards patients. Prompt engineering is a process of strategically crafting input instructions to guide model outputs towards non-stigmatizing language and can be used to train LLMs to employ more inclusive language for patients. This study showed that employing prompt engineering within LLMs reduced the likelihood of stigmatizing language by 88%.

For their study, the authors tested 14 LLMs on 60 generated clinically relevant prompts related to alcohol use disorder (AUD), alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), and substance use disorder (SUD). Mass General Brigham physicians then assessed the responses for stigmatizing language using guidelines from the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (both organizations' official names still contain outdated and stigmatizing terminology).

Their results indicated that 35.4% of responses from LLMs without prompt engineering contained stigmatizing language, in comparison to 6.3% of LLMs with prompt engineering. Additionally, results indicated that longer responses are associated with a higher likelihood of stigmatizing language in comparison to shorter responses. The effect was seen across all 14 models tested, although some models were more likely than others to use stigmatizing terms.

Future directions include developing chatbots that avoid stigmatizing language to improve patient engagement and outcomes. The authors advise clinicians to proofread LLM-generated content to avoid stigmatizing language before using it in patient interactions and to offer alternative, patient-centered language options.

The authors note that future research should involve patients and family members with lived experience to refine definitions and lexicons of stigmatizing language, ensuring LLM outputs align with the needs of those most affected. This study reinforces the need to prioritize language in patient care as LLMs become increasingly used in healthcare communication.

VCU Massey Comprehensive Cancer Center is the first site in the United States to be activated in a global Phase 2a clinical trial evaluating PTX-100 (AKA GGTI-2418), a first-in-class small molecule inhibitor of geranylgeranyl transferase-1 (GGT-1), for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), a rare and often treatment-resistant T-cell lymphoma.

Said Sebti, Ph.D., associate director for basic research and Lacy Family Chair in Cancer Research at Massey and professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology at the VCU School of Medicine, is the co-inventor of PTX-100 and the scientific founder at Prescient Therapeutics, which is sponsoring the trial.

"This trial reflects Massey's long-standing commitment to translating basic science discoveries into innovative treatments that can directly benefit patients."

Said Sebti, PhD, Professor, Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University

Thinking about the journey of PTX-100, Sebti remarked, "As a cancer researcher, there is no greater fulfillment than seeing a therapy you co-invented in the laboratory begin to reach those who need it most. With the launch of this global Phase 2 trial of PTX-100 in CTCL, where new treatments are urgently needed, that long-held dream feels deeply real.

To see my academic home, Massey, lead the way as the first U.S. site to open enrollment to this trial, is one of the most exhilarating and humbling moments of my career, and is a powerful reminder of what science can achieve when driven by purpose and passion.

The newly launched phase 2a global trial will enroll patients with CTCL across leading academic cancer centers in the United States, Australia and Europe, with the aim of further evaluating the efficacy and safety of PTX-100 in patients with relapsed or refractory disease.

PTX-100 is currently believed to be the only GGT-1 inhibitor in clinical development globally, representing a novel class of targeted therapies. After demonstrating safety and early signals of clinical activity in a first-in-human Phase 1 study, PTX-100 advanced into a Phase 1b expansion cohort focused on patients with T-cell lymphomas, where it showed encouraging signs of efficacy and a favorable safety profile.

Based on these results, PTX-100 received orphan drug designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration for all T-cell lymphomas, as well as fast-track designation for the treatment of relapsed or refractory mycosis fungoides, the most common form of CTCL.

CTCL is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma where immune cells called T cells become cancerous and primarily affect the skin, causing itchy, red, scaly patches that may resemble eczema or psoriasis.

The enzyme GGT-1 plays a critical role in cancer biology, as it is essential for the activation of Rho, Rac, and Ral proteins, molecular switches that mediate the cancer-causing activity of the oncogene RAS, one of the most commonly mutated oncogenes in human cancers.

Sebti and his colleagues have pioneered the development of GGT-1 inhibitors designed to block these downstream RAS effector pathways, thereby inducing programmed cell death and halting tumor growth in a variety of cancer models.

"This global Phase 2a clinical trial of PTX-100 will help provide an extension of care for our patients diagnosed with this rare cancer, for which new therapies are urgently needed," Robert A. Winn, M.D., director and Lipman Chair in Oncology at Massey, said. "We are incredibly proud of Dr. Sebti and his team for bridging the gap between world-class scientific innovation and the communities we serve, ultimately making significant strides in the fight against cancer."

The global soccer players' union hit back at FIFA and its president Gianni Infantino on Friday, saying their autocratic style of leadership was harming the rights of its members.

“Football needs responsible leadership, not emperors,” the FIFPRO network said after a meeting of 58 national player unions responded to FIFA pursuing its agenda with unofficial player representatives.

“It needs fewer autocratic monologues and more genuine, inclusive and transparent dialogue,” the union added.

FIFA announced two weeks ago it reached a consensus on key issues after Infantino hosted a group of mostly non-recognized officials in New York ahead of the Club World Cup final.

The latest rift between soccer's governing body and its players' unions flared while the European Commission in Brussels is considering a formal complaint against FIFA. It was filed by FIFPRO's European division and national leagues in Europe against FIFA's style of governance and decision-making.

FIFA denounced what it called Friday the union leadership's “increasingly divisive and contradictory tone" in pursuing a public relations battle "to preserve their own personal positions and interests."

FIFPRO said Friday its core concerns included an overloaded global match calendar with too many games for elite players, lack of physical and mental recovery periods and extreme playing conditions.

Players at the month-long Club World Cup in the United States reported feeling dizzy and unwell in the heat of daytime games played to appeal to worldwide TV audiences.



The 63-game tournament backed by Saudi Arabian money was lucrative for clubs, especially in Europe, though FIFA added it to the schedule without formally consulting players.

The tournament, FIFPRO said, was “celebrated by President Infantino despite being held under conditions that were extreme and inappropriate for any human being, demonstrating a troubling insensitivity to human rights, even when it concerns elite athletes.

“FIFPRO reaffirmed its unwavering commitment to protecting the rights of men and women players — rights which are being seriously undermined by commercial policies imposed by its autocratic system of governance,” the Netherlands-based union said of FIFA.

“This is a model that puts the health of players at risk and sidelines those at the heart of the game,” FIFPRO said, adding it was “unacceptable for an organization that claims global leadership to turn a blind eye to the basic needs of the players.”

FIFA responded by challenging the union to publish its statutes and “transparent annual accounts.”

“Let us be clear: you cannot preach transparency while operating in opacity,” the world soccer body said.

FIFPRO has not had a formal working agreement with FIFA since the previous one expired in 2023.

MEXICO CITY, Mexico (July 26, 2025) – The U.S. U-17 Women's National Team opened the 4 Nations Tournament with a 1-1  draw with Canada as outside back Sydney Schmidt equalized with a header off a corner kick in the 88th minute.

Tournament regulations stipulate that each team earns one point for a draw, followed by a penalty kick shootout, with the winner earning an additional point in this round-robin tournament, which also features host Mexico and Costa Rica.

The USA went first in the shootout, and Schmidt made it two goals in a matter of minutes when she led with a powerful conversion. Forward Lauren Malsom, midfielder Scottie Antonucci (whose shot was touched by the goalkeeper but hit the post and rolled over the line), and team captain and central defender PearlCecil then all coolly finished their spot kicks. On Canada's fourth attempt, Olivia Chisholm squared off with U.S. goalkeeper Peyton Trayer but skied her shot way over the bar. That set the stage for Nyanya Touray's winning shot, which she calmly dispatched into the net, sparking an exuberant celebration from the U.S. team.

The USA will next face Costa Rica on July 29 (9 a.m. MT / 11 a.m. ET on live on Telemundo Deportes' YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and Tiktok accounts) and then Mexico on Aug. 1 (11:15 am MT / 1:15 pm ET live on Telemundo Deportes' YouTube and Facebook accounts) to finish up the round-robin competition.

The young Americans struggled to get things going in the first half, and a tough and athletic Canada side scored off a set play in the 41st minute. A long service into the penalty box by Lacey Kindel found the head Chloe Taylor, and she guided it into the upper right side of the net for the 1-0 lead, giving Trayer no chance.

In an evenly played first half, the USA had the first chance, coming in the fifth minute when midfielder Jaiden Rodriguez struck a heavy free kick from about 25 yards that had to be parried away by Canada goalkeeper Olivia Busby at the right post.

Canada skimmed a shot off the crossbar soon after, and in the 21st minute Rodriguez hit the woodwork as well, spinning her shot 17-yard off attempt off the intersection of the crossbar and post at the right corner.

Trayer had to make a nice save on a low shot to the left post, but the USA had the final two chances of the half as Rodriguez flashed a shot just outside the right post from the top of the penalty area.

In the 45th minute, center forward Ella Kral ran the ball down on the left wing, cut in and forced a diving save from Busby with a shot from 19 yards out that was headed into the left side of the net.

The second half was an entirely different story as the USA kept Canada pinned in its half with a combination of quick passing through the midfield, pressing defense and some dangerous flank play. Canada had a few dangerous looks off the counter, but it always seemed as if another goal came, it would be the Americans to score it. And they did.

With stellar performances from second-half subs Antonucci, Loradana Paletta, Touray, Anastasia Showler-Little, Malsom and Elayna Kocher putting intense attacking pressure on Canada, the USA earned a corner kick from the right side in the 88th minute. Antonucci served a perfect cross to the far post, where Schmidt, who played both left and right back in the game, crashed through traffic to hammer home a header from close range. It was Schmidt's first international goal in her fifth U-17 cap.

The USA had a few more chances to win it in the waning moments, but the three minutes of stoppage time passed and the match went to penalty kicks, setting the stage for the Americans to convert all five of their penalty shots.

The other match of the day featured a 2-2 draw between Mexico and Costa Rica. Mexico won that shootout, 4-1, to earn an additional point, meaning the USA and Mexico are tied atop the 4 Nations Tournament standings with two points each. Canada and Costa Rica each have one point, making the second matchday on Tuesday, July 29, vital towards the tournament title. Mexico, with two goals scored to the USA's one, is currently in first place via that tiebreaker.

The tournament is serving as important World Cup preparation for all teams as each will be competing in the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup later this fall in Morocco. The scheduling of the international matches is a part of the continuing focus on the U.S. Way philosophy which emphasizes increased programming for Youth National Teams to create more opportunities for young players to advance through the pathway to the full U.S. Women's National Team with the goal of representing their country at a world championship.

For any player looking to make a significant contribution at the 2026 FIFA World Cup, playing regular minutes and being in form is a must. 

While many of the U.S. men's national team players have sorted out their club situations or are already key contributors, the same can't be said for Matt Turner, who seems to have lost his grasp on the starting goalkeeper role under head coach Mauricio Pochettino. 

Through the 2024–25 season, the 31-year-old struggled to find time on loan with Crystal Palace from Nottingham Forest, playing only three games. Meanwhile, he struggled at the Concacaf Nations League with the USMNT and was surpassed by New York City FC's Matt Freese at the Concacaf Gold Cup. 

Now, after nearly securing a move to Lyon in France's Ligue 1, he might be out of luck. While the club were keen to bring him in as a replacement for Lucas Perri, their financial situation has proven problematic, and they have taken on legal help to cancel the transfer worth a reported $9.4 million. 

Previously, the financial situation had relegated the French giants to Ligue 2, before an appeal saw them reinstated into the top flight, albeit on hard times. 

Yet, the issues facing Turner are two-fold. First, he has to sort out which club he belongs to, and at the same time, navigate the right path towards consistent playing time at a high level, to keep his place on the USMNT. 

Here are three options he could take.

The most straightforward and primary option for Turner would be that Lyon complete the transfer from Nottingham Forest, regardless of their current financial situation. From Turner's perspective, it would allow him to be a top-choice goalkeeper in Europe for the first time, replacing Perri, who recently joined Premier League side Leeds United. 

Currently, Lyon have Lassine Diarra, Mathieu Patouillet and Remy Deschamps under contract, with Deschamps the only one to have played first-team games for the club, but likely to be the backup under Turner, should the transfer go through. 

When Turner moved from Forest to Crystal Palace on loan, the hope was that he may be able to get a few more minutes and battle for a key role. Yet, he never challenged Dean Henderson for the starting spot, and faded into the background of Palace's plans, even as USMNT teammate Chris Richards thrived at center back. 

However, should the transfer be cancelled, a loan to the lower levels in England could be in the cards, albeit a potential step down from the level he should be competing at if he hopes to be the starting goalkeeper for the USMNT. 

Leaving Europe might not entice many, but it could be the right path for Turner, after his so-far unsuccessful foray into UEFA. Previously, he was a star with the New England Revolution, and would likely slide right into a starting role if he were to return to that club. 

Other potential clubs that could look at a new starting goalkeeper include the San Jose Earthquakes, Atlanta United and D.C. United, with others having the potential to open up a spot should they view Turner, who has expressed his openness to an MLS return, as an option. 

Turner's struggles in England aren't the first time for an American goalkeeper, and a return to MLS could match a similar path to Zack Steffen, who failed to crack regular minutes with Manchester City before returning to MLS as a star goalkeeper with the Colorado Rapids.

The All India Football Federation (AIFF) have confirmed that two high-profile coaching applications, allegedly sent by former Barcelona manager Xavi Hernandez and current Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola, were fraudulent. The revelation comes as the federation continue their search for a new head coach for the Indian men's national football team.

Major League Soccer side Columbus Crew have signed FIFA Club World Cup star Wessam Abou Ali from Egyptian club Al Ahly FC. Transfermarkt understands that the Crew will pay an initial $7.5 million (€6.4m) plus $2m (€1.7m) if Abou Ali scores 15 goals for his new club. The deal also includes a 15% sell-on clause. The initial fee alone makes Abou Ali the third most expensive signing in the Crew's history. Abou Ali has signed a contract until 2027 with an option for 2028. Abou Ali becomes just the third Palestinian national team player in MLS history and the most expensive Palestinian in history.

“Wessam is a special player whose journey speaks to his resilience, character, and tireless work ethic, which are qualities we value at our Club,” Columbus Crew general manager Issa Tell said in a club statement. “He is a proven goal-scorer who knows what it takes to help his team win. His clinical finishing, energy, and charisma will strengthen our squad, and we are confident that he will thrive within our system.”

Abou Ali's journey is indeed extraordinary. Born in Aalborg, Denmark, Abou Ali played for Aalborg's youth clubs from where he eventually moved on to Vendsyssel FF and then to Sweden, where he played for Sirius. Finally, in 2024, the Danish striker who represents Palestine internationally joined Egyptian powerhouse Al Ahly. There, he scored 38 goals and provided ten assists in 60 games across all competitions. The 26-year-old burst onto the world scene during the FIFA Club World Cup, where he scored a hattrick in the 4-4 draw against Porto.

Who is Abou Ali? Columbus Crew sign forward with great free kick ability
What sort of player is Abou Ali? “He is an advanced forward who usually plays in the spaces in opponents' back-line,” Egypt data scout at Transfermarkt, Osama Rakha, said. “For years, Al Ahly struggled with set pieces, but Abou Ali solved that with his excellent free kick abilities, scoring important goals in the CAF Champions League and Egyptian Premier League. There is no doubt that Wessam is a top star for Al Ahly, winning the Egyptian Premier League top scorer award within six months of joining the club, scoring 18 goals and providing six assists in just 19 games. Last year, he missed some time with an injury but came back in top form.”
With all that in mind, it isn't surprising that Abou Ali has become a significant star both in Palestine and Egypt. Indeed, Al Ahly fought hard to keep the player, and it took a player strike on Abou Ali's part to facilitate the transfer. Despite the dramatic ending, Al Ahly managed to capitalize on the situation. The €6.4m initially received will make Abou Ali the second most expensive departure in Al Ahly's club history, and should he hit his bonuses, he could break a record set by Malick Evouna during the 2016/17 season (overview).

We head to the Middle East for the latest enthralling UFC action

The UFC bandwagon rolls back into the United Arab Emirates this weekend for the first time since UFC 308: Topuria vs Holloway last October. Robert Whittaker was in the co-main event on that occasion, but this time the Aussie takes centre stage at the Etihad Arena, when he clashes with Reinier de Ridder in an intriguing middleweight bout.

Whittaker, who was crowned UFC middleweight champion back in 2017, will have painful memories of the last time he stepped into the Octagon in Abu Dhabi. He was forced to tap out in the opening round of his UFC 308 match-up with the unbeaten and classy Khamzat Chimaev. ‘The Reaper' had been holding a 100% record in the Arabian country prior to that loss, following back-to-back successes against Darren Till & Jared Cannonier in 2020. Whittaker will be hoping to rediscover some of that winning form this Saturday night (July 26), when he takes on a surging Reinier de Ridder.

Robert Whittaker's opponent was also in action in Abu Dhabi last year. However, the Dutchman will have a happier time recalling his time spent in the Middle East. He pulled off a devastating first round stoppage victory against Magomedmurad Khasaev at ‘UAE Warriors 51' in the summer of 2024. That triumph was the start of a 4-fight win streak for De Ridder, as he rattled off further stoppage successes since joining the UFC, against Gerald Meerschaert, Kevin Holland and Bo Nickal between November last year and May.

Elsewhere on the card, the previously scheduled Movsar Evloev vs Aaron Pico bout is now cancelled, due to Evloev picking up an injury. The new co-main event features the former UFC bantamweight champion, Petr Yan, who goes head-to-head with Marcus McGhee. Yan is still rebuilding after losing three on the bounce in 2022 & 2023. Wins last year against Song Yadong and Deiveson Figueiredo helped steady the ship though. McGhee heads to Abu Dhabi in confident mood following six straight successes and he'll be hoping to give a positive performance in his first ever fight outside the United States.

The Etihad Arena is an 18,000-capacity indoor arena in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, located on the Yas Bay Waterfront district of Yas Island. It opened in January 2021, with its first event being UFC on ABC: Holloway vs Kattar. The arena held its second UFC event days later, hosting UFC on ESPN: Chiesa vs Magny.

Alex Phillips was speaking after FIFPro held a meeting in Amsterdam with 58 national player unions from around the world to discuss concerns over the way the sport's world governing body FIFA is managing global football.

The meeting came less than two weeks after the end of the first 32-team Club World Cup in the United States, a tournament hailed as a huge success by FIFA president Gianni Infantino but criticised by FIFPro for the demands it has placed on players already faced with a crowded schedule.

"Before the Club World Cup, I was speaking to some of the top stars and they were saying they hadn't had a rest for 'X' amount of time," Phillips said.

"One of them even said, 'I'll only get a rest when I get injured'. Others were resigned actually, and cynical about speaking up.

"Then you see some of the same players two weeks later having to record social media videos saying 'We think the Club World Cup is great,' because their employers are telling them to do it.

"You have this contradictory situation where players can't speak up. They are in an invidious position. They can speak up but it might have consequences."

FIFPro said that FIFA's recent focus on the Club World Cup in the United States was an example of the body ignoring many fundamentally more important issues facing players around the world.

"It is unacceptable for an organisation that claims global leadership to turn a blind eye to the basic needs of the players," FIFPro said in a statement, notably citing the "overloaded" match calendar, heat concerns at the Club World Cup and an "ongoing disregard for players' social rights".

FIFPro Europe filed a complaint to the European Commission last year accusing FIFA of abusing its position with regards to its handling of the international match calendar.

The summit hosted by the union on Friday came after it was left out of a meeting held by FIFA on the eve of the recent Club World Cup final.

Sergio Marchi, the Argentinian president of FIFPro, this week slammed Infantino's leadership of FIFA and accused him of running an "autocracy" in an interview with The Athletic.

FIFA hit back at FIFPro in a statement on Friday as it called for dialogue "with legitimate bodies that put player welfare first" and said it had tried unsuccessfully to get the union to attend its meeting in New York on July 12.

"FIFA is extremely disappointed by the increasingly divisive and contradictory tone adopted by FIFPRO leadership," the Zurich-based organisation said.

"This approach clearly shows that rather than engaging in constructive dialogue, FIFPRO has chosen to pursue a path of public confrontation," which aims to preserve "their own personal positions and interests."

Inter Miami CF announced today it has signed Argentine midfielder Rodrigo De Paul from Spanish giants Club Atlético de Madrid. De Paul will initially join the Club on loan through the 2025 Major League Soccer (MLS) season; the deal includes an option to make the transfer permanent through the 2029 MLS season.

The World Cup champion and two-time CONMEBOL Copa América winner, regarded as one of the best in the world in his position, brings world-class quality to the midfield and adds elite, title-winning experience to the squad. The 31-year-old, nicknamed El Motorcito (the little engine) for his tireless work rate, will join the squad and begin training with the team upon the receipt of his P-1 Visa and ITC.

“Assembling a team that inspires our fans to dream continues to be one of our primary aspirations, so we're thrilled to sign a player of Rodrigo's caliber. He is a winner who has conquered the world stage; his ambitions match ours at Inter Miami, and we are hungry to achieve these goals together,” said Managing Owner Jorge Mas. “Several of the best players in global fútbol have already chosen Inter Miami as their home, and Rodrigo joining our roster is another landmark as we continue on this journey to change the trajectory of the sport in this country and make our fans proud.”

“Rodrigo is a player I've admired for many years. As a leader he has brought so much to the teams he has played for - especially with his national team Argentina. He brings experience, passion and quality to our team and to our city. I'm excited to welcome another World Cup winning player not just to Inter Miami, but also to MLS," said Co-Owner David Beckham.

“What brings me to Inter Miami is the desire to compete, win titles, to write the pages in the Club's history,” said De Paul. “It's a Club that is shaping up to be great, to have a long history, so that many people follow this incredible team.”

After the highly anticipated announcement of his signing, Inter Miami CF's newest addition, world-class Argentine international midfielder Rodrigo De Paul, will be unveiled to the Club's passionate fans during Saturday's pregame at 7 p.m. ET at Chase Stadium. Don't miss the chance to give a warm welcome to ‘El Motorcito' this Saturday, July 26, and secure your tickets for the Inter Miami vs. FC Cincinnati match HERE!

De Paul joins Inter Miami with a formidable resume both at the club and international levels. Internationally, he was one of the main figures alongside Inter Miami captain Lionel Messi in Argentina's historic 2022 FIFA World Cup title, as well as in La Albiceleste's 2021 and 2024 CONMEBOL Copa América and 2022 CONMEBOL-UEFA Cup of Champions conquests. At the club level, the midfield engine has racked up nearly 500 appearances across all competitions and tallied 57 goals and 74 assists, representing Racing Club in his native Argentina (2012-2014, 2016 on loan) before an accomplished spell in Europe, playing for Valencia CF (2014-2016), Udinese (2016-2021) and Club Atlético de Madrid (2021-2025).

The versatile midfielder has also earned various individual accolades throughout his successful career. Notably, he earned Copa América 2021 and 2024 Team of the Tournament honors, and most recently featured in the LaLiga Team of the Season for the 2024-25 campaign.

The Sarandí, Buenos Aires, Argentina native began his career in the youth ranks at Racing Club prior to being promoted to the first team and making his professional debut in February 2013. De Paul went on to establish himself as a key player for Racing over the next seasons before embarking on a new chapter in European fútbol in 2014. In all, he totalled 72 appearances across all competitions in two stints for Racing (he briefly returned on loan in 2016), contributing seven goals and seven assists. In his time at Racing, he faced current Inter Miami goalkeeper Óscar Ustari in an Argentine First Division match in 2013 when he was a Club Atlético Boca Juniors player.

Starting in 2014, De Paul developed a successful career in Europe. First, he played 44 matches and recorded two goals and four assists in two seasons for historic Spanish side Valencia, before making a move to Italian Serie A side Udinese. The midfielder flourished as a leader in his five seasons in Italy, donning the captain's armband for I Bianconeri, making 184 total appearances across all competitions, scoring 34 goals and dishing out 37 assists.

In 2021, De Paul signed for Los Colchoneros in the Spanish capital and became an integral piece in midfield. In all, he racked 187 appearances, 14 goals, and 26 assists across all competitions for Atlético in a spell in which he notably played alongside new Inter Miami teammate Luis Suárez during the 2021-22 season. Additionally, during his two spells in Spain, he faced current Inter Miami head coach Javier Mascherano, defender Jordi Alba, midfielder Sergio Busquets, Messi, and Suárez on multiple occasions in their days as FC Barcelona players.

On the international stage, De Paul made his debut for Argentina's national team in 2018 and has gone on to earn 78 caps, scoring two times, in a fruitful era for La Albiceleste. The midfielder was fundamental to helping Argentina clinch four major titles, winning the 2022 FIFA World Cup to earn a historic third crown for the nation, the 2021 and 2024 CONMEBOL Copa América titles, and the 2022 CONMEBOL-UEFA Cup of Champions title. In that span, De Paul and Inter Miami captain Messi have shared the pitch a total of 62 times for their country's senior side.

The left-hander was down a set and 5-3 before battling back to reach the WTA 500 final.ByTENNIS.comPublished Jul 26, 2025 copy_link

Leylah Fernandez emerged victorious in a gripping battle with Elena Rybakina Saturday to reach the Mubadala Citi DC Open final in Washington, D.C.And she did so after Rybakina served for the match in the second set, leading to a dramatic encounter lasting three hours and 16 minutes.On a day that produced little to separate the competitors, it was Fernandez who out-served the 2022 Wimbledon champion when it counted to secure the 6-7 (2), 7-6 (3), 7-6 (3) victory."'Hard work' and 'fight' has been the pillars, my tennis journey, my dad and I and our family on everyday life," Fernandez told press.

"'Hard work' and 'fight' has been the pillars, my tennis journey, my dad and I and our family on everyday life," Fernandez told press.

The left-hander won 16 of her first 17 points on serve, but watched as Rybakina rocketed consecutive return winners in the opening tiebreak to swing the momentum in her favor. The Kazakh appeared to be in control by securing an immediate break to launch set two, but an inability to extend her lead to a double break despite chances in her next two return games—including 0-40 at 3-1—would later cost the No. 3 seed.Sensing Rybakina's tightness, Fernandez worked the energy of the crowd to her advantage to level for 5-5. Back in another now-or-never situation, the Canadian opened a 5-0 lead en route to trading tiebreaks on the scoreboard.

Neither player managed to create a break point in the decider, leading to one final shootout. Fernandez saved two of her best forehand strikes of the encounter to open a 4-0 advantage.

Luciano Darderi maintained his perfect record in ATP Tour finals on Saturday at the Plava Laguna Croatia Open Umag, where he downed Carlos Taberner 6-3, 6-3 to win his second title in as many weeks.

The Italian triumphed at the ATP 250 in Bastad last week and backed that up in Umag, where he used his brutal baseline power to blast through the draw and become just the third man to win at least three tour-level titles this year, joining Carlos Alcaraz and Alexander Bublik, who also won his second consecutive trophy in Kitzbuehel on Saturday.

"It is something special for me," Darderi said. "The last month has been crazy. I just want to thank my dad and my whole team. Without them it would be impossible. I am very happy about the title.

"It was two crazy weeks. If you told me this two weeks ago, I'd say it was impossible. But I am very happy with my performance and my tennis was incredible this week. I will try to rest now and continue to play like this in the next week on hard courts."

In the final game of the match, Darderi seemed to roll his ankle when he brought up match point. Visibly limping, the Italian managed to seal victory in the following point before he collapsed to the court in the Umag rain.

Unable to walk properly, Taberner demonstrated great sportsmanship to help the second seed to his feet, with Darderi then receiving treatment on his ankle ahead of the trophy ceremony.



Darderi, a four-time tour-level champion, is up 11 spots to No. 35 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings following his run at the clay-court ATP 250. The 23-year-old began July at No. 59, but has climbed to within three spots of his career high No. 32 after winning nine consecutive matches across Bastad and Umag.

In the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting, rain fell for the majority of the 86-minute clash but it did not deter the second seed. Darderi struck 20 winners to 17 unforced errors and a forehand winner at 3-2 in the first set was enough to earn him the crucial break in the first set.

The Italian looked in control throughout the second set and is now 19-1 on clay in 2025 against players outside the Top 30, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

Taberner upset top seed Francisco Cerundolo en route to his maiden tour-level final. The Spaniard leaves Croatia up 27 spots at No. 84 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and is set to rise to a career high on Monday.

After meeting in two consecutive Grand Slam finals, Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner will be the overwhelming favourites to reach the championship match at the US Open. 

Alcaraz and Sinner played out another classic in the final of Wimbledon earlier this month, following their five-set thriller at Roland Garros, which lasted five hours and 29 minutes. 

The two have split the last seven major titles between them, and look set to dominate men's tennis for years to come. 

However, former US Open champion Dominic Thiem thinks there are four players who can stop the ‘new two' at Flushing Meadows in September. 

In an interview with ‘Cronache di Tennis‘, Thiem said: “The finals at Roland Garros and Wimbledon were incredible. They raised the bar of this sport beyond what we were used to.

“They play faster and faster, but they make fewer mistakes and move better and better. I didn't expect two more generational talents to arrive so quickly after the Big Three. And Novak is still playing.”

“Today they're too far ahead. Then they, too, can lose: we saw it with Grigor Dimitrov at Wimbledon, or even Alexander Zverev, Taylor Fritz, and Jack Draper, if they play perfectly.

“I doubt they'll win every Slam in the next 10 years, but today they're one step ahead of everyone.

“I would have liked to play against Alcaraz and Sinner in my prime. I don't know how it would have ended, but we would have had fun.”

In 2025 so far, Alcaraz has played 54 matches on the ATP Tour and has lost just six of them. 

His first defeat of the season came at the Australian Open, where he bowed out in the quarter-finals to Novak Djokovic. 

During February and March, he suffered defeats in three consecutive tournaments, losing to Jiri Lehecka in Qatar, Jack Draper in Indian Wells, and David Goffin in Miami.

At the Barcelona Open, he was beaten in the final by Holger Rune, before going on a 24-match winning streak, which ended in the Wimbledon final against Sinner. 

The world number one, on the other hand, has only lost three times this season, the first of which came in the Italian Open final at the hands of Alcaraz.

After losing to the Spaniard again in the Roland Garros final, his most recent defeat was to Alexander Bublik in Halle.

Bianca Andreescu returns to Canada and is welcomed by a tough draw which includes an opening round contest against Barbora Krejcikova. 

The Canadian will face the former Wimbledon champion in a blockbuster opening round match which both players will feel they need to win. 

Andreescu is ranked 188 in the world and is once again aiming to overcome an injury-stricken season in order to produce some magic in North America. 

Should Andreescu win her opening round match then fourth seed Mirra Andreeva will await in the second round. 

Andreeva could face another Canadian in the form of Leylah Fernandez in the third round before a fourth round match against Daria Kasatkina. 

The potential quarter-final for Andreeva could be either Elena Rybakina or Emma Navarro, who could face Rebecca Marino in the first round. 

Top seed Coco Gauff could face Danielle Collins to begin her campaign with potentially Sofia Kenin awaiting in the last 16. 

However, Kenin could face Canadian rising star Victoria Mboko in her opening round contest. 

The bottom half of the draw will see Jessica Pegula take on either Maria Sakkari or Carson Branstine in the opening round. 

Pegula won Toronto last year and will be hoping to match her form from last year's North American hard court swing. 

The American could face compatriot Amanda Anisimova in the quarter-finals as Anisimova aims to overcome her Wimbledon final humiliation with a win against either Lulu Sun or Sorana Cirstea. 

In-form Emma Raducanu could await Anisimova in the third round as the Brit will open up her campaign against Elena-Gabriela Ruse with Peyton Stearns awaiting in the second round. 

Other storylines are Madison Keys' potential second round contest with Tatjana Maria while Genie Bouchard plays the final tournament of her career and will begin against Emiliana Arango with Belinda Bencic awaiting in the second round. 

Finally, Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek will begin her campaign against Yulia Putintseva or a qualifier with Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Clara Tauson also in her section of the draw.

B.C.-born Canadian tennis player Vasek Pospisil plans to retire at 35 after the National Bank Open.Christinne Muschi/The Canadian Press

As Canadian tennis player Vasek Pospisil is set to retire at the National Bank Open at age 35, his father Milos can't pick one favourite memory from his son's career. 

Maybe it was trekking to tournaments together in a small Winnebago, seeing him win a Wimbledon doubles title, or watching him upset then World No.1 Andy Murray at Indian Wells. 

But it's hard to top the feeling of seeing his son represent Canada in Davis Cup and help the country win its first title in 2022. Especially since Vasek was the first of his three sons to be born in Canada after the family escaped from the former Czechoslovakia and made a life in Vernon, B.C.

“That was such a big deal for us as immigrants from former Czechoslovakia, to give something back,” said Milos Pospisil, who had coached his son until age 20. “You could tell by watching Vasek playing Davis Cup what it meant to him to represent Canada.”

Milos and his wife Mila are in Toronto this weekend to watch their son play his final tournament, along with other family and friends. It's fitting, as the player himself recognizes he could never have made it without the family's sacrifices. The father once quit his job at the local brewery to coach him full time and help him reach a pro tennis career, even sold their home to finance the way.

“It's very important that my family is here, because I was a long shot, and it was like a family project for me to make it,” said Pospisil. “It was just as much my dad's success, as mine, and for the whole family.”

Pospisil sifts through a lifetime of tennis memories. He started out young, playing on concrete courts in Vernon, with his dad as his coach. He tested himself against his older brothers. There weren't many others playing tennis in the area at the time. 

They found clever ways to save money in an expensive sport over the years. In Europe, the father bought a used Honda Civic so they could travel by car as much as possible. When in North America, they got a small diesel Winnebago to travel everywhere from California to Florida, stopping at rest areas along the U.S. freeways. They drove through cold places too, and the heat would sometimes conk out. The youngster would make them both coffee.

“I have incredible memories with my dad,” said Pospisil. “Just an incredible childhood, and I'm very fortunate to have the family that I do.”

Later on, Tennis Canada helped support them. During his 18-year career on the ATP Tour, Pospisil reached a career-high No. 25 singles ranking in 2014. He won seven ATP Tour doubles titles and reached three singles finals, in Washington (2014), Sofia and Montpellier (both 2020). He was named the ATP's Comeback Player of the Year in 2020.

Pospisil helped provide one of the most memorable moments in recent Canadian Open history when he reached the semi-finals as a qualifier in Montreal in 2013 and lost an all-Canadian showdown to Milos Raonic. Along the way, the slogan “Anything is Pospisil” came to characterize the player.

After breakout tennis season, anything is Pospisil

In doubles, he won Wimbledon alongside American teammate Jack Sock in 2014 – a duo known as ‘The Pop-Socks.” He was the doubles No. 4 player in the world in 2015.

Representing Canada, he was a two-time Olympian (2012 and 2016) and played in 35 Davis Cup ties from 2008 to 2025. He'd begun as a 17-year-old who idolized Canadian doubles star Daniel Nestor and got to team up with him several times. His last tie for Canada was earlier this year in Montreal, where he partnered with Davis Cup rookie Liam Draxl. 

Felix Auger-Aliassime, who played a key role in Canada's Davis Cup title, says it was fun to see Pospisil celebrating it.

“I was so happy to play my part, because he deserved it for how much he's given to Team Canada,” said Auger-Aliassime. “I mean, playing ties all over the world. . .me watching that as a kid inspired me to one day play for the team.”

Pospisil also made his mark as an advocate for players' rights, joining Novak Djokovic in founding the first-ever Professional Tennis Players Association in 2019. 

Earlier this year, along with the PTPA, he filed an antitrust lawsuit against the main governing bodies of professional tennis.

While he doesn't regret for a minute spending his energy on the PTPA work, he admits it distracted from his work on the court in recent years. 

“Going from someone that was very popular amongst the establishment at all these tournaments to suddenly being extremely unpopular was tough,” he said. “You're going to work and half the people that you see can't stand you, and half the people love you.”

Injuries also disrupted Pospisil's career several times. He hasn't played many matches in the past few years, especially at the ATP Tour level. He estimates he's spent 80 per cent of the last three years rehabbing injuries. Each attempted comeback seemed to hit a roadblock. Burnout set it. Finally, he knew it was time to call it a career officially in one final tournament in Toronto.

As for what's next, Pospisil says he'll pursue his interests in business. He's enjoyed helping raise money for a VC fund in the U.S. during recent years.

Pospisil doesn't see himself becoming a player coach, but he does plan to stay close to tennis. He's keen to help with any Davis Cup duties, should Tennis Canada ask him. He's also interested in aiding in-need tennis youngers in a philanthropic way.

“Nothing would make me happier than to help young juniors in less privileged positions,” he said. “I learned through years of trial and error, so if I can help expedite the learning curve for somebody who is a good person, or two or three or more players, then I would find that fulfilling.”

Pospisil's dad welcomes the post-retirement era.

“We're gonna miss seeing him competing in the big tournaments,” said his father. “But I'm also quite excited about seeing him go through his next chapter of life.”

"She doesn't follow the press."

Royal fans were delighted when Kate Middleton attended Wimbledon solo on July 12 to watch the women's singles final. For the occasion, Princess Kate wore a white Self-Portrait dress, which she accessorized with an Anya Hindmarch tote bag and Gianvito Rossi suede pumps. Now, a royal source has revealed how the Princess of Wales felt when she received a standing ovation after arriving at Wimbledon.

Speaking to Us Weekly, a royal source said of the moment, "[Kate] felt really good, and it reinforced her recovery and that everyone is rooting for her." The source continued, "She doesn't follow the press so to get a real-world reaction was incredibly fulfilling for her."

The source further elaborated, "The ovation at Wimbledon was unexpected... [Kate was] really surprised and felt humbled by it."



"The ovation at Wimbledon was unexpected."

As the royal patron of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, and an enthusiastic tennis fan, Princess Kate is a regular attendee at Wimbledon. The Princess of Wales even made an unexpected appearance at the sporting event in 2024, while undergoing preventative chemotherapy treatment following a cancer diagnosis. As a result, it's completely understandable that the crowd celebrated Princess Kate's return to the tournament, and her recovery from cancer, by giving her a standing ovation.

The Princess of Wales returned to Wimbledon on July 13 with husband Prince William, and two of their three children—Prince George and Princess Charlotte. While Prince Louis sadly missed the action, Princess Kate seemed delighted to be attending the high-profile event for a second day.

For her second 2025 appearance at Wimbledon, Kate wore a royal blue V-neck dress, which she paired with her wide-brimmed, ribbon-trimmed hat from L.K. Bennett—an item beloved by Marie Claire's senior royal editor, Kristin Contino. Unfortunately, Kate's exact hat has since sold out, but similar items remain available for anyone hoping to replicate her regal style.

Coming into the contest on the back of 16 wins from his last 18 matches on Tour, Bublik produced another assured display on the Austrian clay, beating Cazaux 6-4, 6-3 in just 86 minutes.

The 28-year-old won 84% of points behind his first serve, overpowering his opponent with 26 winners across the two sets.

It continues a remarkable resurgence for Bublik, who has already claimed silverware in Halle and Gstaad this summer, as well as reaching the last eight at Roland Garros.

"I can't believe I did it as it was probably one of the toughest weeks in my life because coming from Gstaad, playing here, different conditions and raining," Bublik said in his on-court interview.

"I am pleased I got through and thank you for supporting me throughout the tournament."

The Kazakh will be keen to carry his momentum into the American hard-court swing, as he looks to climb into the top 20 and surpass his career-high ranking of world number 17.

Vondrousova has been polishing her on-court form in the 2025 season after injuries took her off the tour for extended periods twice in the last 12 months. She shined particularly in June when she won the WTA 500 Berlin Tennis Open, her first title since lifting the Wimbledon trophy. On the way, she beat Australian Open champion Madison Keys and world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka.

The rivalry between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz has become the main focus of men's tennis especially this year, as the Italian and the Spaniard faced each other in the final at both Roland Garros and the Wimbledon Championships.

Their battle in Paris was electrifying from all points of view and is destined to remain a feat in the memory of fans, not only because it was the longest final in the history of the French Slam. The 23-year-old Italian was really one step away from the feat and had three match points in a row in the fourth set, but his top rival did not give up and prevailed in the fifth set after almost five and a half hours.

The world number 1 took revenge over the 22-year-old Spaniard in the Wimbledon final a couple of weeks ago, proving to be superior despite losing the first set in a rather mocking way.

The hope of fans around the world is that there will be a new chapter in this amazing rivalry already at the US Open at the end of the summer, with Jannik who will be called upon to defend the title won in New York a year ago. The Big Apple also evokes good memories in the mind of Carlos, who won the first Grand Slam title of his young career right there in 2022. In that edition, the ace from Murcia defeated Sinner at the end of an epic clash in the quarterfinals.

In an interview with 'TRM', former ATP ace and current coach Renzo Furlan discussed the rivalry between Sinner and Alcaraz: "Both are eager to improve and push themselves to the limit, as always happens when there is such an important rivalry. There is no doubt that these two players are several steps above the others right now and – if there are no surprises – they will be the benchmarks of men's tennis in the coming years as well. It is not excluded that there may be the rise of some other player like Lorenzo Musetti or Ben Shelton."

The first half of the 2025 season gave Carlos Alcaraz five titles – in Rotterdam, Monte Carlo, Rome, Roland Garros and Queen's respectively – while he missed out on his third win in a row at the Wimbledon Championships due to a deluxe version of Jannik Sinner, who defeated him on the iconic Centre Court to become the first Italian ever to win the world's most famous tournament.

The 22-year-old Spaniard can be very satisfied with how he reacted to the difficulties of the beginning of the year, when he was unable to express his best tennis and had also had a small crisis after the shocking elimination against David Goffin in the second round of the Miami Open.

The five-time Grand Slam champion has made no secret of the fact that he will give his best in the second half of 2025 to return to the top of the ATP rankings, knowing that his top rival Sinner will have to defend many more points than him from Cincinnati onwards.

Both Carlos and Jannik will skip the Toronto Masters 1000 which begins next week and will return to action directly in Ohio, where Alcaraz's run in 2024 had already ended in the second round due to the fatigue accumulated at the Paris Olympics.

Like all the other top players, the champion from Murcia also took a little vacation after the Championships and recently returned to practice at the 'La Manga Club'.

The world number 2 knows that he has to change something from the past, as his level dropped significantly in the second half of the year in both 2023 and 2024. After winning his second Wimbledon title last season, Carlitos has not expressed his best level and has only triumphed at the Beijing ATP 500 by beating Sinner in an epic final.

It's no secret that the Spanish star's main goal is the US Open, which kicks off on August 24 in New York.

Karsten Braasch is one of tennis' most recognisable players

The German never made any huge inroads in the sport but his unorthodox serve, the goggles he wore on court and his tendency to smoke in changeovers made him an unforgettable figure. 

Braasch was a bit of a journeyman, a consistent tennis player on the ATP and ITF circuit with a career spanning between 1986 and 2001.

The now 58-year-old has a career-high ranking of No. 38 in the world but never made the second week of a Grand Slam or won a title.

Braasch's notoriety in the sport would end up coming not in an official match but during an exhibition.  

Serena and Venus Williams are widely considered as some of tennis' most successful ever players. 

Right from their debuts, the pair were seen as generational talents, a hype they lived up to with Serena ending her career with 23 Grand Slam titles and Venus with seven.

As a result of their dominance, many had raised the question as to whether they could compete with men. 

Venus, who recently secured a tour win aged 45, and Serena had also both claimed that they could likely beat any man ranked outside the top 200.

So in 1998, that opportunity came when the pair took part in a Battle of Sexes exhibition at the Australian Open.

Serena faced Braasch first, with the German ranked 203 in the world at the time.

He overcame Serena 6-1 in one set before beating Venus 6-2 in the second.

Braasch was 30 at the time and experienced pro while the Williams sisters were still teenagers.

Braasch had also made headlines as he played the two matches after finishing a round of golf and drinking two shandies.

There have been several Battles of the Sexes -- exhibition matches played between a man and a woman or a doubles match between two men and two women.

The most famous occurred in 1973 at the Houston Astrodome between 55-year-old Bobby Riggs and 29-year-old Billie Jean King.

King's 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 victory was viewed by an estimated 50 million people in the United States and 90 million worldwide, it further cemented King's status in the sport and helped her fight in the road to equality in tennis.

In October 2013, Novak Djokovic and Li Na played a light-hearted five game mini set in Bejjing, China to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the China Open.

Li was given a 30-0 advantage and along with Djokovic was not playing seriously.

The Serbian had even swapped places with ballboy at one point.

In the end, Li was victorious and went on to win the mini set 3-2.

At the Open de Tennis de Bourg-de-Péage in France in December 2023, the final of the women's draw was due to be played between Donna Vekic and Mirra Andreeva.

Vekic withdrew with injury and Ukrainian Marta Kostyuk agreed to replace her, but withdrew as a result of the backlash of facing a Russian.

So in an unusual turn of events, the tournament director asked Yanis Ghazouani Durand, who was ranked 1145 at the time, to play the 16-year-old.

Ghazouani won in straight sets but Andreeva took home the trophy as the winner of the women's draw.

Brad Gilbert has rubbished reports that Jannik Sinner's coach Darren Cahill will not be working with the Italian at the 2025 US Open.

On Friday, Italian newspaper la Repubblica reported that Simone Vagnozzi would be Sinner's only coach at the New York Grand Slam as they claimed Cahill will take “a short break.”

Sinner has been coached by former Italian player Vagnozzi since February 2022, while Cahill joined the team in July 2022.

The coaching unit has been hugely successful, with Sinner winning four of the last seven Grand Slams and holding the world No 1 ranking since June 2024.

Gilbert, a former coach of Andre Agassi, Andy Roddick and Coco Gauff, works alongside Cahill as an analyst and commentator for ESPN.

In reply to a Twitter post sharing the claim that Cahill will miss the US Open, Gilbert made it clear that he expects the Australian to be at Flushing Meadows.

“For the record this is completely fake news,” wrote the former world No 4.

Cahill is a former ATP player and renowned coach who previously guided Andre Agassi, Lleyton Hewitt and Simona Halep to Grand Slam titles and world No 1.

Jannik Sinner's coaching surprise ahead of US Open

Jannik Sinner claimed to have ‘wanted' controversial fitness trainer back despite doping row

The Australian was expected to leave Sinner's team at the end of the 2025 season after it was announced at the start of the year that he would be retiring from coaching on the tour.

However, Cahill has not fully closed the door on continuing his partnership with Sinner. Italian newspaper Il Corriere della Sera claimed after Sinner's Wimbledon triumph earlier this month that Cahill will remain on the Italian's team in 2026.

In his press conference following the Wimbledon final, Sinner revealed the decision on Cahill's future was in in his hands after winning a bet.

“It depends on whether I want to tell the truth or not,” Sinner said.

“We had a bet before the final. I told him, ‘If I win tomorrow, I can decide whether you stay until the end of the year or not.' Now the choice is mine!

“I've always looked for an honest person. Someone who gives me so much, not just on the tennis court, but in life outside of it, about how to live both in victories and disappointments. And he's very good. If I choose to stay with him, he probably won't travel so much anymore. That's normal.

“We'll have to see about that too. But I've always said, back in Australia, that I'd like to have him, because things are going well. Now we'll see.

“The season is still nothing, there are still so many tournaments to go, and I'll still see him a lot. You never know. But let's say I won the bet and now it's up to me to decide, we'll see.”

Asked this week by the ATP Tour whether Cahill will stay, Vagnozzi said: “Honestly, nothing's certain at the moment. But we'll all be happy if Darren stays.”

The 22-year-old Dane missed out on a place in the semi-finals when she lost 3-6, 5-7 to Russian outsider Anna Kalinskaya on Saturday night.

As the fourth seed in the tournament, Tauson went into the game as favorite against Kalinskaya, who is four years her senior and ranked No 48 in the world while Tauson is ranked 19th.  

Tauson quickly fell behind in the first set, where she was broken three times in her own serve.

In the second set, Tauson still couldn't get her game going against the strong Kalinskaya, and the Dane trailed 3-5 after a new Russian service breakthrough.

In the next game, the Dane broke to 4-5, and a little later she also equalized to 5-5 giving her hope of a possible comeback, but it was quickly extinguished.

On the other side of the net, Kalinskaya got hold of herself and the Russian won the next two games to close out the match.

Frances Tiafoe's quest to win the Mubadala Citi DC Open title in his backyard will have to wait another year.In an all-American quarterfinal on Friday night in the nation's capital, fourth-seeded Ben Shelton got the better of Tiafoe for the third time in four career meetings, 7-6(2), 6-4. Shelton has now reached the semifinals in D.C. in back-to-back years, making him the third American to do that this century after Andre Agassi (2001-04) and Steve Johnson (2015-16).All four matches between Tiafoe and Shelton have come in a less than two-year span. After Tiafoe got revenge for a four-set 2023 US Open defeat to Shelton last year in Queens in five sets, he celebrated by exclaiming that Arthur Ashe Stadium was "his house."But at his hometown tournament, which he grew up attending since childhood in College Park, Md., Shelton got the last word.Read more: Frances Tiafoe not happy with Taylor Townsend roasting Washington Commanders-inspired fit at DC Open

Tiafoe failed to serve out the first set at 6-5 before Shelton roared back. Continuing his success in tiebreakers, the lefty won six straight points to take a one set lead, and broke Tiafoe again at 3-3 on the way to a straight-sets win."We know tennis is a long journey. We're going to play each other a bunch of times," Shelton said post-match, adding that "it's tough not to cheer for a guy like that" after the two hugged it out at the net.Shelton finished the match with 29 winners to Tiafoe's 20. He also hit just 18 unforced errors to Tiafoe's 28. But most impressively, 31 of Shelton's 55 serves went unreturned.

"This court does a lot for my serve," Shelton later added. "The ability to get the ball out of the zone is huge, especially against a guy like Foe who is so good in the pocket. So my ability for my flat serves not only to be coming in at 145 [mph] but also rising above his shoulders is huge."Second serve, too. He's one of the best in the world when he's locked in, attacking second serves and making you feel like you're on the back foot, taking a second serve and coming to the net. My winning percentage on second serve was probably the highest that it's ever been against him."My aggressive brand of serving, and then I was willing to take chances on the return of serve, and I executed a lot. So I think that combination was kind of tough to deal with in these conditions."The 22-year-old seeks his second final of 2025, after finishing runner-up to Alexander Zverev in Munich, against either No. 1 seed Taylor Fritz or No. 12 seed Alejandro Davidovich Fokina.

Taylor Townsend is set to rise to No. 1 when the new WTA doubles rankings come out on Monday, after reaching the doubles final in Washington D.C. alongside China's Zhang Shuai.The two advanced past Emma Raducanu and Elena Rybakina in the semifinals of the WTA 500 event on Friday when Raducanu was forced to stop down 4-1 in the first set due to illness."It feels like a dream and is without a doubt one of the highlights of my career," Townsend told the WTA. "I loved watching doubles, especially Martina Navratilova play, and it's an incredible honor to join the list of amazing players to have earned the No.1 ranking."Townsend will be the 50th player to reach No. 1 in WTA doubles rankings history, since they began on September 10th, 1984, and the 13th American player to achieve the feat after Navratilova, Pam Shriver, Gigi Fernandez, Lindsay Davenport, Corina Morariu, Lisa Raymond, Liezel Huber, Venus Williams, Serena Williams, Bethanie Mattek-Sands, Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula.She'll also be the fifth left-hander to do it after Navratilova, Lucie Safarova, Ekaterina Makarova and Storm Hunter.And she'll also become the first mom to reach No. 1 on the WTA doubles rankings—she returned to the tour in April of 2022 after giving birth to her son, Adyn Aubrey, in March of 2021.

Townsend will replace her usual partner, Katerina Siniakova, at No. 1—Siniakova is spending her 161st career week there this week, and 46th straight since the end of the US Open last year.A player's WTA doubles ranking is based off of their best 12 results over the last 12 months, and nine of both Townsend and Siniakova's best 12 results have come with each other—two titles (the Australian Open and Dubai this year), one more final (the WTA Finals last year), four more semifinals (the US Open last year and Indian Wells, Miami and Wimbledon this year) and two more quarterfinals (Cincinnati last year and Roland Garros this year).But when it comes down to their other three best results, Townsend now surpasses Siniakova—the Czech's total 835 ranking points, while Townsend's will now total either 945 or 1,120 ranking points, depending on how the final goes in D.C.

'I drove a tiny bit better' - Polesitter Norris on the small margins that made the difference in Spa Qualifying

George Russell qualified sixth for the Belgian Grand Prix after Kimi Antonelli could manage only 18th place.

George Russell admitted his concern that Mercedes had “taken a big step backwards” after another difficult qualifying session for the team at the Belgian Grand Prix.

Mercedes has struggled for pace across the Spa-Francorchamps weekend so far, with neither Russell nor Kimi Antonelli reaching the final phase of Sprint Qualifying on Friday, and both struggling to progress through the field in the Sprint itself.

While Russell's sixth place for Sunday's Grand Prix may appear a strong result on paper, the Canadian Grand Prix race winner pointed to the fine margins that defined his session.

“It was for sure, the maximum,” he said. “All of my laps were strong, but it's clear that, as a team, we've taken a big step backwards this weekend. We don't really know why.

“One tenth slower in Q1, I'd have been almost out. A tenth slower in Q3 and I'd have been P10. P6, I feel, is without doubt, the maximum we could have achieved.”

Last year, in a race Russell also started from sixth, the Briton took the chequered flag after putting on a spectacular display to make a one-stop strategy work.

Although his celebrations were halted as he was disqualified for his car being underweight, when asked if this gives him hope for this year's running, he added: “Yeah.

“I don't think it'll pan out just like last year, especially as it's wet tomorrow. But anything can happen. We'll take those positives, but as a team, we just need to assess why we had four podiums in the first six races and we've had one in the last six races.”

Rookie Antonelli has also found himself enduring a recent run of a bad form, with a third place in Canada his only points score in the last six races. Indeed, he is yet to score a point on European soil.

An error in Sprint Qualifying left him at the back of Saturday's grid, but the Italian had no such excuse on Qualifying for the Grand Prix, as he set the third slowest time, with only the two Aston Martins behind him.

“It's just a difficult period,” he conceded. “I just need to get out of this and try to improve for the next one.”

“The confidence has been missing. Definitely, I struggled to have the same feeling as yesterday, for example, and I just really need to find the light at the end of the tunnel again.”

ONBOARD: Lando Norris' 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the Belgian Grand Prix 

'I drove a tiny bit better' - Polesitter Norris on the small margins that made the difference in Spa Qualifying

Max Verstappen has emerged victorious in the Sprint at the Belgian Grand Prix.

Max Verstappen has clinched his first Sprint win of the season at the Belgian Grand Prix weekend, the Red Bull driver holding on for victory after making an impressive overtake on Oscar Piastri during the opening lap of action.

While Piastri initially made a solid launch to hold onto P1 off the line, Verstappen surged ahead later in the lap to take the lead. But as the Sprint entered into its second half, the Dutchman faced increasing pressure from both Piastri and the other McLaren of Lando Norris.

Despite Piastri's best efforts, Verstappen continued to defend his position and sealed a dominant win, with Piastri and Norris ultimately having to settle for second and third respectively.

Charles Leclerc followed in fourth for Ferrari, despite briefly running ahead of Norris in the early stages, while Haas' Esteban Ocon, Williams' Carlos Sainz, the other Haas of Ollie Bearman and Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar followed in fifth through to eighth.

After just one practice session on Friday, Sprint Qualifying had decided the grid for the third 100km dash of the season, a format that awards points to the top eight finishers from a maximum of eight for P1 down to one for P8.

Sprint results

FORMULA 1 MOËT & CHANDON BELGIAN GRAND PRIX 2025

Piastri stormed to his first Sprint pole of the campaign by setting an impressive lap of 1m 40.510s, putting him over four-tenths clear of Verstappen in second while the other McLaren of Norris had to settle for third.

Meanwhile there were some surprises further down the order; Hamilton was the shock exit from SQ1 in P18 while both Mercedes cars missed out on the top-10 shootout, with Antonelli eliminated early in P20 and Russell ending the session in P13.

Ahead of the Sprint getting underway, one change was confirmed to the grid as Franco Colapinto – who had ended Sprint Qualifying in P19 – would start from the pit lane due to Alpine changing the rear wing of his A525 under parc ferme conditions.

There was further trouble for the Enstone-based squad when Pierre Gasly's car was pulled off the grid in the build-up to the Sprint, with the Alpine crew rolling the vehicle back through the pit lane and to the garage due to a water system issue.

When the tyre blankets came off prior to the formation lap, it was revealed that the whole field would be starting on the medium compound with the exception of Colapinto, staring on the soft tyres from the pit lane. Meanwhile it was soon confirmed that Gasly would not be taking the start, with the team unable to fix the issue on his car in time.

As the lights went out, Piastri made a strong start to lead away from pole position – but Verstappen was not ready to give up, the Dutchman making a stunning overtake by getting in Piastri's slipstream down the Kemmel straight to surge into P1.

Meanwhile the other McLaren of Norris also lost a position, with Leclerc taking P3 from the Briton just behind the leaders. Behind them, Ocon had held onto P5 ahead of Sainz in P6, Bearman in P7 and Hadjar in P8, the Frenchman gaining a place following the exit of his countryman.

Piastri remained on the tail of Verstappen, with the gap standing at around half a second as Lap 4 ticked down, yet the Australian could not quite close in. Elsewhere, Norris retook third place from Leclerc, whilst Alpine confirmed that Gasly had joined the Sprint two laps down, the team seemingly using the event as a test session.

Further back, Antonelli made a move on Nico Hulkenberg to grab 17th place, the Italian looking to make up for his disappointing Sprint Qualifying. Piastri, meanwhile, looked to have kicked up a little gravel as he pushed hard in his pursuit of Verstappen.

“I've got no rear already,” Hamilton was heard radioing in on Lap 7, the Ferrari driver running in P14 following his off in Sprint Qualifying on Saturday. At the front, Norris looked to be catching the leading pair of Verstappen and Piastri – would a three-car fight for the lead play out?

Antonelli was chasing Hamilton by Lap 9, the rookie looking to put pressure on the driver he replaced at Mercedes. Up ahead, Norris was now just six-tenths behind Piastri, with the Australian the same margin behind Verstappen.

Piastri looked to find a way around the outside of the Red Bull on Lap 11, but the World Champion managed to defend. “I can't brake,” Verstappen reported, having had a slight moment at the last chicane.

None of the trio were ready to give up as the Sprint entered into its final laps, with Norris told that Piastri's battery was at “mid-level” as the Briton remained on the tail of his team mate. Further back, Alex Albon was also in fighting mode as he engaged in a close scrap with Fernando Alonso for P14.

Despite his efforts, Piastri could not close the gap further to Verstappen and the Dutch driver crossed the line to seal a dominant Sprint victory, the Red Bull man taking the chequered flag by 0.753s from his closest rival.

Norris was a further six-tenths back from Piastri in third place, ahead of Leclerc, Ocon, Sainz, Bearman and Hadjar in the remaining points-paying positions of fourth to eighth respectively.

Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto and Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson completed the top 10 order, with Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda and the Mercedes of Russell just missing out in 11th and 12th.

The Aston Martin pair of Lance Stroll and Alonso were P13 and P14, while Hamilton ended a difficult Sprint event in P15.

Albon had to settle for 16th, followed by Antonelli, Hulkenberg and Colapinto in the final positions ahead of Gasly, who was classified as retired after his brief return to action.

"It worked out really well," said Verstappen. "That is the only real opportunity that you're going to get against them, and we got it into Turn 5. I knew it was going to be very tough keeping them behind, so it was very much like cat and mouse with DRS, battery usage, and the whole race was within seven tenths. I couldn't afford to make big mistakes. I had one tiny hiccup into the last corner, but apart from that, it was a great result to keep them behind. To have a win here at Spa, for me, it's a Sprint win, but it still counts and I'm very happy with what we did out there.”

Following the Sprint, the drivers will next return to action during Qualifying for the Grand Prix later on Saturday, with the session set to begin at 1600 local time. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can follow the action.

'I drove a tiny bit better' - Polesitter Norris on the small margins that made the difference in Spa Qualifying

Brad Benavides claimed his and AIX Racing's first pole position in Formula 3.

Brad Benavides earned his and AIX Racing's first pole position in FIA Formula 3 with a superb final attempt to pip Championship leader Rafael Camara to the top spot.

The American delivered a 2:04.253 as the track ramped up by a full second in the latter stages of the session to claim P1 and a memorable result for the team.

Camara recorded a time that put him on provisional pole earlier in Qualifying, but his final improvement was good enough only for second, though he was made to sweat going into the last attempt of the day.

The Scuderia Ferrari Driver Academy member's 2:04.359 was deleted for exceeding track limits, leaving him 22nd before it was reinstated ahead of the chequered flag, promoting the TRIDENT driver back into second place.

Completing the top three was Rodin Motorsport's Callum Voisin, who also took full advantage of the track improvement to go third quickest, 0.011s ahead of teammate Roman Bilinski in fourth.

Martinius Stenshorne completed the top five for Hitech TGR and led fellow McLaren Development Driver Ugo Ugochukwu, the PREMA Racing talent following in sixth.

Championship contender Nikola Tsolov wound up seventh for Campos Racing ahead of team mate Tasanapol Inthraphuvasak in P8.

Charlie Wurz, Bruno del Pino and Noah Stromsted followed, with Freddie Slater set to go from reverse grid pole after ending up 12th on his second weekend in FIA F3 this season.

'I drove a tiny bit better' - Polesitter Norris on the small margins that made the difference in Spa Qualifying

Lando Norris secured pole position for the Belgian Grand Prix in an exciting Qualifying session from Spa-Francorchamps.

Lando Norris will start the Belgian Grand Prix from pole position after going fastest of all in Qualifying, the McLaren driver beating team mate Oscar Piastri and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc with an impressive lap around Spa-Francorchamps.

After setting the pace in Q1, Norris was bettered by Piastri in the Q2 segment – but the Briton was quick to lay a marker in Q3, grabbing provisional pole during the first runs with an effort of 1m 40.562s.

That time proved unbeatable as the final laps played out, with Piastri ending up in second place just 0.085s away from the other papaya car. Leclerc, meanwhile, improved to put himself into P3 ahead of the Red Bull of Max Verstappen in fourth.

Alex Albon was an impressive fifth for Williams, slotting in just ahead of Mercedes' George Russell in sixth. Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda followed in seventh, while the Racing Bulls pair of Isack Hadjar and Liam Lawson took eighth and ninth respectively and Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto completed the top 10.

Qualifying results

FORMULA 1 MOËT & CHANDON BELGIAN GRAND PRIX 2025

Despite a strong Sprint performance earlier in the day, the Haas duo of Esteban Ocon and Ollie Bearman were not so lucky in Qualifying, having both exited Q2 in 11th and 12th places ahead of Alpine's Pierre Gasly in 13th.

Off the back of his podium result last time out at Silverstone, Nico Hulkenberg qualified down in 14th for Kick Sauber, while Carlos Sainz wound up in 15th for Williams.

There was early drama in Q1 when an at-risk Lewis Hamilton looked to have done enough to get himself out of danger – only for his lap time to be deleted owing to track limits, which dropped the Ferrari driver down to P16 and out of the session.

Alpine's Franco Colapinto was just behind in P17, while Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli had a disappointing outing down in P18. It was also a tough Qualifying for Aston Martin, with Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll bringing up the rear in P19 and P20 respectively.

More to follow

A few hours on from the third Sprint of the season, the drivers and teams switched their attentions to Qualifying in order to decide the starting order for Sunday's Belgian Grand Prix.

There was early drama prior to Q1 getting underway, with Alonso reporting that he “nearly crashed” with Bearman after the Haas moved into the pit lane queue ahead of him, while Hulkenberg ended up with a damaged front wing following contact with the Aston Martin of Stroll, an incident that will be investigated after the session for an unsafe release.

The whole field had bolted on the soft tyres for the opening runs of the 18-minute segment, with the exception of Colapinto on the mediums, and once every driver had put a lap on the board it was Leclerc on top of the timesheets with his effort of 1m 41.635s.

His time was then bettered by Norris, who went faster by 0.625s – while Piastri then slotted into second, but still just under two-tenths adrift of his team mate.

At the other end of the spectrum, the drivers at risk in the danger zone were Colapinto, Russell, Stroll, Antonelli and Bortoleto, with Alonso on the bubble in P15.

As the clock ticked down for the final minutes of Q1, the track became busy as everybody tried to get themselves into the top-10 shootout. Both Mercedes cars improved, with Antonelli slotting into 11th while Russell moved up to eighth.

But there was trouble for Antonelli as the better efforts of others pushed the Italian down the order, moving him down to P18 and out of the session. Also exiting were the Aston Martin duo of Alonso and Stroll, who ended up at the rear of the field in P19 and P20.

Meanwhile all eyes were on Hamilton as the seven-time World Champion found himself at risk. The Briton initially did enough to haul himself up to P7 – but a shock twist saw his lap deleted for exceeding track limits, leaving him down in P16, one spot ahead of Colapinto

Knocked out: Hamilton, Colapinto, Antonelli, Alonso, Stroll

The session continued at pace with Q2, Verstappen leading the pack out as the next segment got underway. Once again, the soft tyre was the preferred option for the remaining 15 drivers as they battled to progress to Q1.

Piastri set the benchmark as the first laps came in, the Australian pumping in a 1m 40.626s to go just 0.089s clear of Norris, while Verstappen was some three-tenths off in third. Further back, Bearman had a moment after a big snap through Pouhon, forcing the Haas driver to abort his lap.

With the opening efforts in, the names at risk were Hulkenberg, Bortoleto, Gasly, Sainz and Bearman – and, following a brief lull in the action, a queue of cars peeled out of the pit lane for their final runs of Q2, prompting a seemingly annoyed Piastri to comment: “Some people need bigger mirrors.”

While Verstappen opted to remain in the pits, the rest of the field were trying to better their times. Gasly moved up to ninth, while Bortoleto went into an eye-catching eighth before an improvement from Lawson then put the Racing Bulls driver into that slot.

The Haas pair – who enjoyed a strong Sprint earlier in the day – both missed the cut when trying to improve, leaving Ocon in P11 and Bearman in P12. Meanwhile Gasly was pushed down to 13th place, and a tough Qualifying left Hulkenberg down in 14th ahead of the Williams of Sainz in 15th.

Knocked out: Ocon, Bearman, Gasly, Hulkenberg, Sainz

The track came alive again as the all-important top-10 shootout began – but who would seal pole position at Spa-Francorchamps?

As the first laps went on the board, Piastri initially looked to have taken provisional pole ahead of Verstappen – only for Norris to storm through on an even quicker time, the Briton beating his team mate by 0.189s via his effort of 1m 40.562s.

Verstappen – some half a second back in third – reported that he “just didn't have the same grip” in the Red Bull, while Leclerc had taken fourth ahead of Russell, Tsunoda, Lawson, Albon, Hadjar and Bortoleto.

With the clock ticking down, all 10 cars headed out for their final grid-deciding runs. Verstappen improved his effort but remained in third place, while Norris also did not better his previous lap. Leclerc moved up to third, pushing Verstappen down a place – but the question remained over whether Piastri could steal pole from Norris.

It turned out that the Australian could not, with his improved lap ultimately not enough to beat Norris' previous time, meaning that the Briton would start from pole position. Elsewhere, Albon was a notable improvement in fifth, putting him ahead of Russell in sixth.

Tsunoda secured his best grid slot as a Red Bull driver in seventh, while the Racing Bulls of Hadjar and Lawson took eighth and ninth, with Bortoleto rounding out the top 10 for Kick Sauber.

"It was a decent lap," said Norris. "I'm happy. I don't know why everyone was pretty worried after yesterday. I wasn't even that far off. It was just a couple of little issues that we had. I was confident after yesterday and coming into today, so it's nice to see that I could get back to the top.”

The 2025 Belgian Grand Prix is set to begin at 1500 local time on Sunday. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can catch the action from Spa-Francorchamps.

ONBOARD: Lando Norris' 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the Belgian Grand Prix 

'I drove a tiny bit better' - Polesitter Norris on the small margins that made the difference in Spa Qualifying

The McLaren pair of Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris have given their take on the Sprint at the Belgian Grand Prix.

Oscar Piastri conceded that it was “a bit frustrating” to not be able to overtake Max Verstappen during the Sprint at the Belgian Grand Prix, while McLaren team mate Lando Norris admitted that the team may need to “reassess” prior to Qualifying later on Saturday.

Despite initially holding onto the lead at the start of the event, Piastri lost the position to Verstappen later in the lap as the Dutchman surged past on the Kemmel Straight – and from there onwards the Australian was unable to retake P1, despite trying to chase down the Red Bull.

Asked afterwards if Lap 1 had played out as he expected, Piastri responded: “Pretty much, yeah. I tried my best to snake my way through the straights and not give too much of a tow, but I just didn't have enough straight-line speed, and then obviously, I didn't have enough straight-line speed for the next 15 laps either.

“Still a good result, still good points. It is only the Sprint and the main points are tomorrow. I'm pretty happy with it, just obviously a bit frustrating that I couldn't get past.”

Pushed on whether the team may trim some downforce from the car ahead of Sunday's Grand Prix to prevent the same scenario from happening again, Piastri said: “It's a great question.

“The weather is looking pretty bad tomorrow, which obviously means you don't want to take off too much wing, but I don't really want to repeat the Sprint we've just had. We'll have a look and see what we can do, but there are a lot of things to look into before tomorrow.”

Despite being left disappointed by his result in the Sprint, Piastri is remaining optimistic about Qualifying later on Saturday.

“I'm looking forward to it,” he explained. “Spa is my favourite track of the year, and especially in Qualifying, it's just mega around here. I'm looking forward to some more laps in anger.”

Behind him, Piastri's team mate Norris had to settle for third place. After being overtaken by Ferrari's Charles Leclerc on Lap 1, the Briton later retook the place and tried to chase down Verstappen and Piastri up ahead. However, like Piastri, Norris was unable to make a move.

“[It was] a bit of fun at the start with trying to overtake Charles,” Norris reflected after the Sprint. “Maybe I could have positioned myself a little bit better, but otherwise, it was a bit too difficult to get past Max.

“Max drove a good race and I wasn't going to get past anyone unless Oscar got past Max. They drove good races. Not a lot we could do on a day like today, so I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

“Obviously, I hoped for a bit of battling or something, but the Red Bull was too quick in the straight for us to catch up. Maybe some tweaks for us to make into Qualifying. I don't know, but we'll reassess and see what we can do.”

Norris arrives into the weekend off the back of two consecutive victories in Austria and Great Britain and is still aiming to make it a hat-trick of wins on Sunday at Spa-Francorchamps.

“That's the plan,” the 25-year-old said. “I'm not too fussed about Sprint races, but obviously, the main race, I prefer to win. We'll see.

“I wasn't too bad yesterday. I was still comfortable, it's just a couple of things didn't go my way, but I'm still confident that we can have a good result later and finish with some good Quali laps.”

Charli xcx has unveiled a set of photos from her wedding with George Daniel of The 1975.


	On Saturday (July 26), the Brat star publicly shared pictures from the July 19 ceremony, an intimate event attended by the couple's close friends and family at Hackney Town Hall in London.


	“did something,” Charli captioned the glimpse into the day she married George, adding the millennial-preferred version of a heart emoji to her post on Instagram: <3.


	Emoticon preference aside, the pictures capture the two artists' in-love vibes amid their celebration of saying “I do” last weekend.

	The first photo on the slideshow captures Charli's bridal look — made up of a Vivienne Westwood dress, a white bouquet and a pair of her signature sunglasses. Photo two has her husband winking at the camera with a cigarette at his lips. 


	As one might expect, other pics document moments of romance, including the newlyweds kissing. See Charli's full set of wedding photos here.


	The pair announced their engagement in July 2023 when Charli showed off her ring on social media and marked the milestone with the comment “charli xcx and george daniel f—ing for life!!!”


	Both artists recently played Glastonbury, with Daniel — drummer, producer and songwriter with The 1975, and a DJ — headlining the U.K. music festival with the band he's been with since his teen years. The 1975 had first billing on the fest's main Pyramid Stage on June 27; Charli closed down the Other Stage the following night. 


	Though he wasn't seen in pictures from the couple's London wedding ceremony, 1975 frontman Matty Healy hyped Charli's set during the Manchester group's career-spanning gig at Glasto, a performance that left him overcome with emotion. Mid-set, he gave his bandmate's then-fiancée a sweet shoutout in between songs: “Give it up for Charli xcx. That's my best friend.”

The trailer for the second season of “Peacemaker” has arrived. Revealed at San Diego Comic-Con on July 26, the John Cena-starring DC Comics comes just two weeks after the release of “Superman,” the kinda official-ish soft-ish reboot of the DC Universe courtesy of now-steward James Gunn. The new season, it was revealed during the Comic-Con panel, will take place a month after the events of “Superman.” “Peacemaker” will arrive on HBO Max on August 21 at 9 p.m. ET/PT.

In a May interview with Entertainment Weekly, Gunn said that getting back around to “Peacemaker” — which premiered its first season long ago in 2022 — was top-of-mind when he took the DC Universe gig. “Once I was done with ‘Peacemaker,' I had to do ‘Guardians 3,' and then when I was about ready to jump [back] into ‘Peacemaker,' I got hired to be the head of DC,” he said. “As soon as I got that job, I made a couple of calls, and the first one was to [Marvel's] Kevin Feige telling him that I'm taking the [job as] head of DC. The second one was to John Cena, and I said, ‘I'm getting this gig, and I still want to do ‘Peacemaker,' but it's going to have to wait. We're going to have to get ‘Superman' working first.'”

The second “Peacemaker” installment being part of the “soft reboot” of the DC Universe was first mentioned way back in 2023, which Gunn also acknowledged.

 










“I developed it along the way, in conjunction with the other DC projects that we're doing, so it's very much connected to ‘Superman' and it's very much connected to what comes after,” he explained. “I had a rough idea of what I was going to do, but it was actually quite different than what the show ended up being.”

Gunn relayed how some elements of the first season play into the second season of “Peacemaker.” “You've seen what we call the QUC, the Quantum Unfolding Chamber, in the first season of Peacemaker, and we see more about that technology in ‘Superman'. The QUC is the center of the story in ‘Peacemaker' Season 2,” he said.

Apparently, some “Superman” characters are even going to wander over to “Peacemaker.” Gunn has also noted previously, though, that the Marvel Cinematic Universe's rather, uh… universal tone is not the objective for DC. Discussing 2027's “Clayface,” Gunn said (via ScreenRant), “We've got ‘Clayface,' which is a totally different thing. Although it's in the same universe, it's a complete horror film. That's one of the things we want to do. There's not a company style. It's not like every movie is going to be like ‘Superman.' The artists — the directors and the writers — each one will bring their own sense to it… That's what we want to bring to the films because we don't want people to get bored. We want to invigorate people.”

 










Cena appeared on the Comic-Con panel in full costume, thrilling the fan-packed audience. Gunn discussed the direction Cena's character would he taking, saying (via ScreenRant) “Peacemaker is a different guy this season. He's dealing with the demons he accepted in the first season.”

So, to sum it up, though “Peacemaker” premiered while the previous DCEU was still in its waning days, Gunn was at the helm, and so it is still canon in the new DCU — or at least the second season is really, really canon. And the events of “Superman” happened one month before the new season's events. Got it?

Check out the “Peacemaker” Season 2 trailer below and watch on HBO Max August 21 at 9 p.m. ET/PT.

			By Anthony D'Alessandro, Dessi Gomez 


	DC Studios stepped in at San Diego Comic-Con where Marvel Studios use to dwell: the late Saturday spot in Hall H with the James Gunn co-run Warner Bros comic book label bringing the second season of Peacemaker. 


	But there was also more reason for glee, for as the panel's moderator Joshua Horowitz observed: “James this is the first time you've been in front of crowd since Superman.” And with that, Hall H erupted in cheer. 


	The panel kicked off with the new trailer for season 2 which shows John Cena's Christopher Smith enjoying a new parallel dimension he's found. It's just like our, and it's even better. It's a place where he can hook up with Jennifer Holland's Harcourt. Meanwhile, back in the real world, Frank Grillo's Rick Flag Sr (from Superman) is out to close the portal in his face-off with Peacemaker. Says Leota in the new trailer to Chris, “No matter how great the grass is over there, you belong here with us.”

	Said Gunn about season 2's Smith: “I really like TV shows where the characters don't just return every season and they're the same exact characters. I want to see growth. I want to see change and sometimes regression,” Gunn said. “And Peacemaker is a different guy this year. He's dealing with the demons he uncovered from the first season and trying to deal with them, and the world is not accepting him the way he is. They aren't accepting him as a hero.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Gunn's Superman leads straight into Peacemaker season 2 with that movie's supporting characters Green Lantern/Guy Gardner (Nathan Fillion), Hawkgirl/Kendra Saunders (Isabel Merced) and Maxwell Lord (Sean Gunn). That trio, as seen in the first teaser, grill Peacemaker for an interview with the Justice League. 

	











	In addition to the trailer show today, Hall H attendees got to see a clip of Harcourt beating up guys in a bar after they try hitting on her with whistles and cat calls. Gunn called it his favorite day on set until they filmed something for Episode 8, which became his new favorite day on set. Holland also teased that she gets to do a Dirty Dancing lift in the opening credits scene.


	In the season one finale, John Cena's Christiopher Smith saves the world from alien butterflies. We also learn that Leota (Danielle Brooks) has a mother, and that's Amanda Waller (Viola Davis). Season one ends with Chris sitting on his stoop, pondering the complexity of life, next to the ghost of his racist dad, Auggie (Robert Patrick) (it's inferred that the guy will be hanging around like an acerbic Obi-Wan Kenobi in season 2). Meanwhile, Goff, the butterfly who was possessing Sophie, has been kept alive by Chris. Chris' father leaves behind a house with an arsenal of weapons and costumes. 


	Per the logline, the new season follows Christopher “Chris” Smith, aka Peacemaker, the vigilante Super Hero as he struggles to reconcile his past with his newfound sense of purpose while continuing to kick righteous evil-doer butt in his misguided quest for peace at any cost.


	Following today's Peacemaker sesh, there's a musical performance from season 2 band Foxy Shazam and Steel Panther.


	Returning Season 2 cast appearing on stage today included Holland, Freddie Stroma, Steve Agee, new cast members Sol Rodriguez and Tim Meadows, Grillo, and Cena. Danielle Brooks came down with illness, seemingly food poisoning, after going out to dinner with Gunn, who got over it by this morning. Cena took the opportunity to chug water to avoid getting sick. The actor then joked about peeing his suit. Gunn also mentioned that Eagley gets his own Lex Luther in Michael Rooker who plays a world renowned eagle hunter.  


	Gunn wrote all eight episodes of Peacemaker and directed three, including the first episode. Gunn, Peter Safran, and Cena are EPs. Greg Mottola, Peter Sollett, and Althea Jones also direct. Based on characters from DC, Peacemaker is produced by Gunn's Troll Court Entertainment and The Safran Company in association with Warner Bros. Television.


Peacemaker happens on Aug. 21. at 9PM ET/PT on HBO Max.

“We think of you all the time when we are in the writers room and we always talk about what would the fans want and love,” exec producer Akiva Goldsman told supporters in Hall H. 


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


Star Trek: Strange New Worlds boldly went exactly where fans wanted them to go with its San Diego Comic-Con panel, delivering a fun presentation that also gave the 6,500-strong crowd in the cavernous Hall H one thing that geeks most: seeing something before anyone else.


	Fandom has always been an important aspect of Trek — the original show famously became a cultural force long after it went off the air after being canceled — and the showrunners made a point to give a nod to the fans.




	“We think of you all the time when we are in the writers room and we always talk about what would the fans want and love,” said exec producer Akiva Goldsman.

					'Resident Alien' Team Responds to Cancellation: "I Wasn't Ready"		
			









	The ensuing banter with the cast led to a Trekkie's delight, a screening of the fourth episode of Strange New Worlds current third season, which doesn't hit Paramount+ until next week. And it was one that was tailor-made for fans.


	Titled “A Spaced Adventure Hour,” the episode was a period murder mystery. But that belied all the callbacks that made what was shown resonate. The setting is 1969 Hollywood with the suspects all being actors and makers of a sci-fi series, one that just got canceled, and one that bears a massive resemblance to the original Trek. Strange New Worlds actor Paul Wesley even plays a Captain Kirk-type of character in a funny recreation of the show within the show, and a star with a massive but fragile ego off-screen


	Also resonating to the Hall H crowd was a speech by Celia Rose Gooding who, in the murder mystery, plays a Hollywood agent who has a monologue about how important of an impact a sci-fi show could have on the world and on making someone watching it feel seen and included.

	











	“I've been acting for 25 years and that was the most fun I've ever had shooting anything,” Wesley said on stage after the episode screened. “I'm trying to do everytihng I can to pay respect and homage to what William Shatner created.”


	“I wonder if he'll see it,” asked Jess Bush, who plays Nurse Chapel, standing on stage with Wesley.


	“I hope so,” the actor said, quipping, “I'll DM it to him.”


	Lead Anson Mount, who plays Captain Pike on the series, wasn't on stage as it was revealed his wife had recently given birth to a baby daughter, Violet. However, in a very short video, Mount made an appearance… sitting in the Enterprise's captain's chair in puppet form. Thus it was teased that in the fourth season, there will be an all-puppet episode, continuing the show's playing around with form, genres and conventions.


	Jim Henson's Creature Shop will be supplying the puppet work for the episode which is being directed by Jordan Canning (Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock). Watch the teaser below.


	The panel also featured the release of a trailer for the audio series Star Trek: Kahn and the first teaser trailer for Star Trek: Starfleet Academy. Based on the reactions of Hall H, the latter showed that the producers will have to work on building enthusiasm for what essentially introduces a crop of new and young characters into the Trek universe. Starfleet Academy is due to premiere in 2026.

Suri Cruise, the only child of former couple Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, was spotted looking stunning as she strolled the streets of New York City on July 9, 2025. The 19-year-old wore a flowy low-rise skirt and cropped white tank top. She completed her look with sneakers, wired earbuds, and a slouchy bag.

In a July 11 feature, Teen Vogue declared Suri has nailed “cool-girl” summer dressing, and praised her for incorporating the “clean girl” aesthetic, a TikTok term used to denote sleek simplicity, without becoming basic. The story says Suri's masterful use of interesting accessories elevates her basics to a level of street coolness. 

According to Hello! magazine, the stylish teen started college at Carnegie Mellon University in August 2024. “Of course, I will miss the close proximity, but I'm really proud of her and I'm happy,” the outlet says mom Katie Holmes told Town & Country about Suri's new chapter.

Holmes posed with Joshua Jackson in July 2025 to promote their film “HAPPY HOURS” wearing unique frayed two-tone denim pants, after opening up to Vogue in the spring about one of her go-to “outfit formulas” for the season.

“I can't wait to get back into a tank top. I usually wear them with a long skirt or baggy pants, so it feels very comfortable,” said the “Dawson's Creek” actress. She also named “nice, simple slip dresses” as an essential. 

But Katie Holmes also appreciates an occasion to get dressed up. “Wearing a glamorous dress to the ballet or opera makes me feel like I am the New York woman I dreamt of being when I was a little girl,” she told the “Fashion Bible.”

Katie Holmes famously dated her “Dawson's Creek” costar Joshua Jackson from 1998 to 1999, per Grazia. Now, fans are thrilled to see the pair side-by-side again as they work on their upcoming film, which Bustle says is a “love story.”

The photo Holmes posted with Jackson, under which she wrote she “so very grateful” to be working on the project, garnered a quarter of a million likes in three days and greatly excited fans.

“JOEY AND PACEY FOREVER,” wrote one, referencing the pair's “Dawson's Creek” characters.

“You know you triggered an entire generation with this post,” teased another, before adding, “Cannot wait to see the project.”

A third fan quoted the show's famous line, “I remember everything,” and punctuated it with a crying emoji.

Deadline says Holmes is “set to write, direct, and star” in “Happy Hours,” which will be a feature film trilogy.

Hulk Hogan‘s family is still processing the loss of the wrestling icon, who died unexpectedly at age 71. Though Brooke Hogan hasn't spoken publicly since the death of her father, Hulk Hogan, her husband and close friend are speaking on her behalf. 

Hogan, whose real name was Terry Gene Bollea, died on July 24 following a reported cardiac arrest at his Clearwater, Florida home. While Brooke has remained silent, her longtime friend Ashley Kora took to Instagram Stories with a moving tribute.

“My dear sweet friend @mizzhogan lost her father today,” Ashley wrote over a black-and-white photo of Brooke with her dad, as per E! News. “He died knowing what I know—Brooke loved him deeply, was fiercely loyal, and only ever wanted him to be peaceful, happy, and surrounded by people who valued him for who he really was.”

Ashley added, “He chose differently for himself. But we can still remember him as a doting father to a little girl with big dreams and a bigger heart. The world lost a legend, we lost Mr. Bollea, Brooke's dad.”

Brooke's husband, retired NHL player Steven Oleksy, reposted Ashley's tribute with a heartfelt message of his own. As per E! News, he responded: “Thank you for the love and support for my beautiful wife. We are incredibly lucky to have you in our lives—not just during this challenging time, but always.”

While the outpouring of love underscores Brooke's deep affection for her father, the two were not in contact at the time of his passing. However, in the weeks leading up to his death, Hulk Hogan and his daughter, Brooke, shared a rare, heartfelt conversation that brought quiet closure. 

According to TMZ, their final exchange, just two weeks before his 2023 wedding, was emotional, with Brooke expressing love and concern for his health, and Hogan offering a soft apology that she has held onto ever since.

Brooke, 37, and her younger brother Nick, 34, are Hulk's children with ex-wife Linda, to whom he was married for 26 years. Despite their split, Linda posted a nostalgic throwback photo with Hulk just days before his death, captioned, “The good old days!”

A post shared by Linda Hogan (@linda_hogan_)

Earlier this year, Brooke welcomed twins, Oliver and Molly, with Steven, marking a new chapter in her life as a mother while still grappling with a complicated family past.

The future of “Star Trek” is here and it truly is boldly going to some new and undiscovered places. (Check out our ranking of every “Star Trek” live-action show). The message from Paramount+'s presentation for the franchise July 26 at San Diego Comic-Con‘s Hall H isn't boundary- and format-pushing alone: It's clear that they want to package new things with some heavy doses of the familiar — major stars, beloved returning franchise vets, and some cutesy gimmicks.

Take a look at the teaser for “Star Trek: Starfleet Academy.”

 










There are a ton of new faces there for the 32nd Century-set show, as much of the cast is teenage and 20-something newcomers. And it's set in a time period, post-“Star Trek: Discovery” that allows for all-new storytelling completely unrestrained by preexisting canon. But that's also a lot of unfamiliar stuff, and audiences can need a little dose of the familiar to anchor them.

So “Starfleet Academy” has a couple of top stars — both Oscar winners, no less — to lend the appropriate gravitas: Hell yeah, Holly Hunter should be someone who leads the next generation into the future as the chancellor of Starfleet Academy — who wouldn't trust her with her college-age kids in the 32nd Century or now? And Paul Giamatti adds just the right edge of menace, whistling the “Star Trek” theme as his “Klingon hybrid” villain, to let us know that Starfleet better look out.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Then there's a returning favorite in Robert Picardo's The Doctor, who apparently is not just another hologram in his series, but literally the exact same Doctor from “Voyager” who's survived more than eight centuries to have his story continue on this show. Continuity with his arc from that show is something showrunners Alex Kurtzman and Noga Landau are promising. (There's also Tig Notaro returning from “Discovery” as Jett Reno, something she told IndieWire she very much wanted to do.)

And there are a couple of intriguing callbacks to keep fans hooked as well: There's a Jem'Hadar Starfleet officer? (A member of the menacing warrior species from “Deep Space Nine.”) And another mysterious “DS9” shoutout as well, as a computer display at the title academy seems to have information on it related to the fate of that show's Capt. Benjamin Sisko — did he die at the end of that series, or did he live on? Whether that is just a throwaway moment or a teaser for a deeper exploration on “Starfleet Academy” remains to be seen.

And across the “Star Trek” portfolio presented at Hall H, this model of some familiarity being mixed in with the new stuff as a kind of sweetener to make swallowing the unfamiliar more palatable was everywhere.

For the first time ever, “Star Trek” is making a push into the audio storytelling space with “Star Trek: Khan,” a podcast about the legendary “Trek” villain in his years after his introduction on the “Original Series” episode “Space Seed” when he and his crew are marooned on Ceti Alpha V. Naveen Andrews, the actor fancast for years as Khan (and should have been cast in “Star Trek Into Darkness”), will be voicing the character.

 










Andrews will be joined by a couple of returning vets: George Takei as Capt. Hikaru Sulu and Tim Russ as young Ensign Tuvok. In the years after Khan's final defeat they uncover more information that allows Khan's story to unfold in flashback. This is a canon-friendly way of presenting this story as we know from a '90s “Voyager” episode that Tuvok served with Sulu aboard the USS Excelsior. Check out the “Star Trek: Khan” trailer here:

And finally, “Star Trek” is nothing without a good gimmick, and “Strange New Worlds” teased that in Season 4 there will be an episode staged entirely with puppets created by the Jim Henson Workshop. Somehow Capt. Pike has even higher, more lush hair here. A little felt is the ultimate volumizer, one supposes. Here's a sneak peek:

That doesn't do anything to counter our charge that “Strange New Worlds” is maybe veering a little too far into the insubstantial, but it shows the elasticity of “Star Trek” in allowing for so many different kinds of stunts. It also reminds me of how in 2005 as an April Fool's Day joke, the StarTrek.com website announced that “Star Trek: Enterprise” would be continuing but only via marionettes to cut down on costs. For a second, teenage me believed that. But I guess I only needed to wait 20 years for some puppet-based storytelling in “Star Trek” to become a reality.

	An investigation is underway in Oklahoma after a television screen in the MAGA state school superintendent's office reportedly showed a video of nude women during an executive session of the State Board of Education on Thursday. 


	The images reportedly appeared on a screen in the office of Ryan Walters, Oklahoma's far-right Superintendent of Public Instruction. Walters previously told schools to teach the Bible and Ten Commandments, demanded students watch him pray for Donald Trump, and named transphobe Chaya Raichik to a state education committee. He also tried to use state money to purchase bibles for classrooms that matched the specifics of those marketed by the president and his family.


	As you might expect, Walters has led a crusade against “pornography” in school libraries. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Two members of the Oklahoma board of education said they were shocked at what they saw on the screen on Thursday. 


	“I was like, ‘Those are naked women,'” board member Becky Carson told The Oklahoman. “And then I was like, ‘No, wait a minute. Those aren't naked, surely those aren't naked women. Something is playing a trick on my eye. Maybe they just have on tan body suits. … This is just really bizarre.'”

	











	“I saw them just walking across the screen, and I'm like, ‘no.” I'm sorry I even have to use this language, but I'm like, ‘Those are her nipples.' And then I'm like, ‘That's pubic hair.' What in the world am I watching? I didn't watch a second longer.”

	











	Carson told Walters to turn the video off. 


	“I was so disturbed by it, that I was like — very loudly and boastfully, like I was a parent or a teacher — I said, ‘What is on your TV? What am I watching?' He was like, ‘What? What are you talking about?' He stood up and saw it. He made acknowledgment that he saw it,” Carson said, according to NonDoc Media, an Oklahoma news website.  “And I said, ‘Turn it off. Now.' And he was like, ‘What is this? What is this?' So he acknowledged it was inappropriate just by those words. And he was like, ‘I can't get it to turn off. I can't figure out how to turn it off.' And I said, ‘Get it turned off.' So he finally got it turned off, and that was the end of it. He didn't address it. He didn't apologize. Nothing was said.”

	Carson and board member Ryan Deatherage said the video looked “retro” and did not involve sexual intercourse. 


	“I don't know if he turned it off or switched the channel, I don't remember,” Deatherage told NonDoc. “I was surprised that when he came back to the table, he was not apologetic. I didn't ever hear an apology for that being on, and he didn't seem to be fazed that it was on.”


	Republican state Senate President Pro Tempore Lonnie Paxton told Oklahoma Voice that the Office of Management and Enterprise Services is carrying out an investigation into the incident. 


	“This is a bizarre and troubling situation that raises serious questions about the events and what took place during yesterday's executive session at the Oklahoma State Board of Education meeting,” Paxton said in a statement. “The accounts made public by board members paint a strange, unsettling scene that demands clarity and transparency.”


	Walters said the claims were a distraction.


	“Some of these board members are blatantly dishonest and cannot hide their political agenda,” Walters told KOKH Fox 25. “It is disappointing that they are more interested in creating distractions than getting work done for Oklahoma families.”

	Walters' communications director, Quinton Hitchcock, called the story a “junk tabloid lie,” according to NonDoc.  


	“Regardless of if recent allegations are true, Oklahomans are in dire need of new leadership at the Oklahoma State Department of Education,” Oklahoma House Democratic Leader Cyndi Munson told KOKH Fox 25.


	“These are serious allegations made by two members of the State Board and an expeditious third-party review is warranted,” Republican House Speaker Kyle Hilbert said in a statement. “I urge the State Superintendent to unlock and turn over all relevant devices and fully cooperate with an investigation.”

	











	“If no wrongdoing occurred, a prompt and transparent review should quickly clear his name,” he added.


	Last year, the Oklahoma State Department of Education's Library Media Advisory Committee — which includes Raichik, who runs the anti-trans Libs of TikTok social media account — attempted to ban The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini and The Glass Castle by Jeannette Walls from Edmond high school libraries. The committee argued that the books are “pornographic.” 


	“Edmond Public Schools not only allows kids to access porn in schools, they are doubling down to keep pornography on the bookshelves,” Walters said in a statement. “Parents and kids should have the confidence of going to schools to learn. Instead of focusing on education, EPS has chosen to peddle porn and is leading the charge to undermine parents in Oklahoma.”


	The case went to the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which sided with Edmond Public Schools and allowed the books to remain on library shelves.

	The list goes on. In 2023, Walters reportedly emailed some Oklahoma lawmakers pornographic images, claiming they were available in schools. 


	“Don't just send me a bunch of graphic, sexually explicit photos without where it came from, or what did they do? That's kind of the problem I got with it,” state Rep. Mark McBride (R) told the local Fox outlet.

On July 26, Deadline reported that “Bend it Like Beckham” will be bending it like Beckham once again, or so says its writer/director Gurinder Chadha. The original film, released 23 years ago in 2022 and starring Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley was an indie sleeper hit, grossing $76 million on a $6 million budget.

The comedy ended up being the harbinger of Knightley's astronomical rise into stardom — coming just one year before “Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl” and “Love Actually.” In it, she is one of two soccer playing girls (the other played by Nagra), who attempt to pursue the sport professionally (and it's called football there, obviously).

“I'm excited to revisit the original characters and revive the enduring story and build on the legacy we helped to create for the women's game,” Chadha said, adding that “I'm pretty certain that everyone's going to want to come back” and that the original cast was aware the movie was in development.

 










Knightley told Jimmy Fallon in 2023 that she did not anticipate that the film would be any kind of hit. In fact, because people told her the title was “embarrassing,” she reassured herself that no one would see it. “It was the idea of it because, you know, women's soccer was not as big back then,” she explained. “And so the idea of the whole thing was sort of ridiculous.”

The actual Beckhams, of course, are ever-present in the cultural conversation. The couple — David and Victoria — made a cameo in the original film, named in Beckham's honor. David was also the subject of the Netflix's  “Beckham,”  which ended up winning the Emmy for Outstanding Documentary Series last year. The show followed the both his and Victoria's personal and professional lives, and its most famous scene became a meme-of-the-moment.

In the first episode (of four), Victoria said that both she and David came from working class families, to which David pushed Victoria to admit that her father drove her to school in a Rolls Royce. In 2024, editor Michael Harte discussed this scene with IndieWire. “You gotta give massive credit to [director Fisher Stevens,” Harte said. “That scene is, if anything, a representation of how good he was at getting people to relax in front of the camera. And also Tim Cragg, our cinematographer, who had the wisdom to keep the camera going back and forth. The person that deserves the least amount of credit is me, because it's probably the least amount of editing in the whole series!”

 










A more Victoria-centric doc is set to release soon, also from Netflix, of which David said, “It took a minute to try and get her to agree with it… It wasn't something that was easy. I think I'm the only one who could convince her and I did, eventually.” But he added that viewers would see her “in a delightful light.” The series will cover Victoria's entire career. “I think it's going to be really special. It's so emotional, there's drama — and the drama's real,” David said.

	Although Heathers (1988) has gone down as a cult classic over the past four decades, it was a career liability for star Winona Ryder after its release.


	The 2x Oscar nominee recently revealed the Michael Lehmann-directed teen dark comedy cost her a role alongside Marlon Brando and Matthew Broderick in the 1990 crime comedy The Freshman.


	“I was told I was never gonna work again if I did Heathers. I did lose a job,” she told Elle UK, hesitating to reveal the part she lost. “OK, OK, I'll tell you. You remember the movie The Freshman?”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Ryder explained, “They thought it was making fun of teen suicide. They were deeply offended and, yeah, they revoked the offer. I'm like, ‘I can't work with Marlon Brando?' But I had to stand my ground. I wasn't gonna apologise.”

	











	In Heathers, Ryder stars as the formerly unpopular Veronica, who joins the titular clique of mean girls, which includes Heather Chandler (Kim Walker), Heather McNamara (Lisanne Falk) and Heather Duke (Shannen Doherty). When she meets mysterious new kid JD (Christian Slater), they begin killing off the Heathers and staging deaths as suicides.


	Although the movie was considered a flop at the time, grossing $1.1 million worldwide as it was met with backlash over the satirical approach to suicide, Heathers has found a cult following over the years, inspiring an off-Broadway musical and a short-lived 2016 TV reboot that was quickly cancelled after it was met with similar criticism as its source material.


	Ryder previously recalled that her agent begged her not to take the role in Heathers, which was penned by Daniel Waters.

Trained on the New York stage — she worked with Cicely Tyson in ‘The Blacks' — she also played Victoria Butterfield, one of Bea Arthur's maids, on ‘Maude.'


							By 

	Mike Barnes


Senior Editor


	Marlene Warfield, the New York actress known for her feisty turns as the prostitute ex-girlfriend of James Earl Jones' boxer in The Great White Hope on Broadway and the big screen and as a young revolutionary in Network, has died. She was 83.


	Warfield died April 6 of lung cancer at a hospital in Los Angeles, her sister, Chequita Warfield, told The Hollywood Reporter.




	Warfield also recurred as Maude's third and last regular housekeeper, the Jamaica-born Victoria Butterfield, on the sixth and final season (1977-78) of the famed Norman Lear-created CBS sitcom that starred Bea Arthur.

	After appearing in the East Village at St. Mark's Playhouse in French dramatist Jean Genet's The Blacks — where she understudied for Cicely Tyson and also worked alongside the likes of Jones, Godfrey Cambridge and Maya Angelou — Warfield made it to Broadway in October 1968 when she was cast as Clara in The Great White Hope, written by Howard Sackler.


	She received Theatre World and Clarence Derwent prizes for her powerful performance, then accompanied Tony winners Jones and Jane Alexander to Hollywood, where all three reprised their roles in the 1970 film directed by Martin Ritt at 20th Century Fox.


	In Paddy Chayefsky and Sidney Lumet's Network (1976), nominated for best picture, Warfield sparkled in a scene in which her Laureen Hobbs, an Angela Davis type, meets with Faye Dunaway's Diana Christensen, a UBS executive who wants to do a weekly series revolving around the Ecumenical Liberation Army.


	After Diana introduces herself as a “racist lackey of the imperialist ruling circles,” Hobbs introduces herself as “a bad-ass Commie nigger.”

	











	The second of the three kids, Marlene Ronetta Warfield was born in Queens on June 19, 1941, and raised in Brooklyn. His father, Sidney, sold tokens for the New York City Transit Authority, and her mother, Ruth, was a homemaker.


	Warfield took tap, ballet and acrobatic lessons as a kid, and while attending the High School of Performing Arts in Manhattan did summer stock, appearing in a 1957 production of Take a Giant Step in the Catskills.


	Later, she studied opera at the Brooklyn Conservatory of Music and acting at the American Institute of Theater and TV Arts.


	She replaced Thelma Oliver in The Blacks in 1962 and worked onstage in A Matter of Life and Death, Elektra, Volpone, Who's Got His Own and The Taming of the Shrew at Lincoln Center before landing on The Great White Hope.


	Around this time, she also was showing up on such TV shows as The Nurses, The Defenders, For the People and Dave Garroway's Wide Wide World and doing commercials for Fab detergent.


	Represented by pioneering Black talent agent Ernestine McClendon, Warfield moved to California in 1977 to join the cast of Maude, on which she made her first appearance late in the fifth season. She succeeded Esther Rolle (as Florida Evans) and Hermione Baddeley (as Nell Naugatuck) as maids in the suburban Findlay household.


	Her Victoria Butterfield was “not stupid, she is not uneducated, she's very ambitious and stands on her own two feet,” Warfield told Jet magazine in August 1977.

	











	Warfield's résumé also included the films Joe (1970), Across 110th Street (1972) and Richard Pryor's Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling (1986) and guest spots on such TV series as The Name of the Game, Lou Grant, The Jeffersons, Little House on the Prairie, Hill Street Blues, Cagney & Lacey, In the House, ER, The West Wing, The Shield, Law & Order and Cold Case.


	In 2000, she returned to the stage in Pittsburgh for a starring role in August Wilson's King Hedley II.


	In addition to her sister, survivors include her son, Keith; her grandson, Demetrius; and a cousin, percussionist Vivian Warfield. She was married to William Horsey from 1967 until his 1993 death. Her brother, Earl, died in January 2024.

Upstart genre company Panick Entertainment will publish the title next year.


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


David Dastmalchian is continuing his budding career as a comics author with a brand new horror title for upstart publisher Panick Entertainment.


	The actor, who can currently be seen in The Life of Chuck as well as Dexter: Resurrection, is working on The Accessories, a five-issue mini-series that he co-created and is co-writing with longtime creative associate Leah Kirkpatrick. The comic and details will be unveiled at Dastmalchian's Saturday panel at San Diego Comic-Con.




	Patrick Piazzalunga is illustrating the books which Panick will publish next year. Panick is the horror and science fiction venture that launched last year and was founded by a cadre of entertainment and comics industry veterans, including several from the world of DC.

	Accessories focuses on the classic side characters that have supported some of horrordom's most vile villains — Igor, the assistant to many mad scientists; Renfield, the lackey to Dracula; and Mrs. Hyde, the wife of dual personality-challenged Dr. Jeckyll/Mr. Hyde.


	The logline and premise reads:


After lifetimes in the background, three of history's greatest horror sidekicks finally say what they've never dared to before: Enough is enough!


Igor, Renfield and Mrs. Hyde have aided their masters' diabolical missions for decades but today is the day they stop being loyal. Today the real horror walks out the front door. The looming question is…what do they do now? These three discarded servants find each other in the fallout, forming a band of gawky but determined anti-heroes caught between angry villagers, vengeful monster-hunters and furious former employers. Their survival will take more than just guts, luckily, they know where to procure more.












In a darkly comic descent into revenge and rebirth, the hench finally claim the title they never asked for…The Accessories!!


	Dastmalchian has built a notable career working with directors such as James Gunn, Christopher Nolan and Denis Villeneuve, with many of their movies falling directly into the geek sphere bullseye. And he next shoots the villain role of Mr. Bison in video game adaptation Street Fighter.


	But he is also birthing a body of comic writing work. Among the highlights is his horror creation Count Crowley, which is published by Dark Horse.


	Panick is focused on genre storytelling, beginning in the field of comics and graphic novels, and then aims to platform that into films, television, games and other media. So Accessories has plans beyond the printed page.


	The first issue is due to hit shelves on June 2, 2026. Check out the first look below.

If the long, twist-filled “Coyote vs. Acme” fight for a release was “It's a Wonderful Life,” then Ketchup Entertainment would be all the townspeople at the end (79-year-old spoiler) chipping in to make sure George Bailey doesn't go under. That's as far as the analogy goes, though film fans can easily guess who is Mr. Potter in this scenario.

Regardless, the townspeople have won the day, and “Coyote vs. Acme” is indeed on its way — finally — with a theatrical release set for August 28, 2026. To sum things up as quickly as possible: the $70 million live-action/animated movie was one of a few (paging “Batgirl”) that were shelved in 2023 as tax write-offs for Warner Bros. (to the tune of $30 million), even though the movie had tested well. After a fan outcry, the film was put up for sale to other studios… but then it quickly was dead in the water again, when nobody met the price WB wanted. A cast and crew screening funeral was even held for the movie. It was dead. George Bailey was going to jump off the bridge.

Enter Clarence- eh… “The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Toons Movie,” which Ketchup distributed though it was only set for a streaming HBO Max (or Max at the time) release. They then made a deal earlier this year for “Coyote vs. Acme,” which the film's star Will Forte expressed relief over earlier this year, telling THR, “I never thought it would happen so it just came out of nowhere and I'm so thrilled,” he said. “Thank you Ketchup Entertainment, I'm so excited for people to see this movie. I'm gonna promote the crap out of it, just tell me what you want me to do and I'll go, I'll do whatever — go to the top of Mount Everest, I'm there.”

The movie directed by Dave Green, also stars John Cena, Lana Condor, Tone Bell, and Martha Kelly. The plot has Wile E. Coyote finally taking Acme Corporation to court after all the injuries he suffered at their hands in his Road Runner pursuit. Oscar nominee Samy Burch wrote the script and producers include Chris deFaria and James Gunn.

So the film's San Diego Comic-Con panel, to say the least, was hotly anticipated. And Ketchup did not disappoint. 

“This movie wasn't suppose to come out,” panel moderator Paul Scheer said (via Deadline). “I heard Warner Bros wouldn't release the film — I've never heard of Warner Bros! This is really an Acme decision and I'm saying that for legal purposes.”

The even had “an Acme lawyer” appear, attempting to halt the film's release.

“These are cease and desist papers from the Acme Corporation. You do not have permission to share information and footage from this anti-Acme film. Please leave the stage,” the performer said, then addressed a cosplaying audience member, “As a copyrighted costume, sir, please disrobe.”

Coyote himself was on the panel, answering questions with signs that read “Yes,” “No,” and “It's a Limited Number of Signs.” Voice of Bugs Bunny Eric Bauza (in character) said that the movie was produced “without the use of A.I. and basketball players.”

 










The audience got a sneak peek of the Wile E. Coyote's starring feature, showcasing a scene that includes a montage of all the Acme products that has malfunctioned for him over the years — all to the tune of “Hurt” as performed by Johnny Cash. Then he sees a commercial for Forte's personal injury attorney, who asks, “Have you ever pulled the ripcord to your parachute and only silverware fell out?” Another courtroom scene featured a faulty roller skate and Cena.

May the other shelved Warner Bros. properties — which also includes another animated film “Scoob! Holiday Haunt” — one day find such a rebirth. Until then, they await discovery at the Island of Misfit Toys. But that is another analogy for another day.

Until then, check out “Coyote vs. Acme” in theaters August 28, 2026. And here is the first poster for the film.

"Astronomer has gotten a lot of questions over the last few days," the actress — and Chris Martin's ex — says in the ad.


													By
												

	Mitchell Peters



Gwyneth Paltrow is stepping in — temporarily — to help clear the air about Astronomer.


	On Friday (July 25), the Academy Award-winning actress and Goop founder appeared in a humorous new video for the tech company. The ad follows a viral incident involving former CEO Andy Byron and HR executive Kristin Cabot, who were caught on a Coldplay kiss cam during the band's Boston concert earlier this month.


	Shortly after Cabot's resignation on Friday, Astronomer shared a social media video starring Paltrow — who was married to Coldplay frontman Chris Martin from 2003 to 2016 — acting as the company's “temporary spokesperson” on behalf of its employees.

	











	“Thank you for your interest in Astronomer,” Paltrow says in the video, seated casually at a desk. “I've been hired on a very temporary basis to speak on behalf of the 300-plus employees at Astronomer. Astronomer has gotten a lot of questions over the last few days, and they wanted me to answer the most common ones.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	As questions flash on-screen — including “OMG! What the actual f—” and “How is your social media team hold-” — Paltrow offers responses that hilariously sidestep the actual drama.


	“Yes, Astronomer is the best place to run Apache Airflow, unifying the experience of running data, ML and AI pipelines at scale,” she says cheerfully after the first inquiry. “We've been thrilled so many people have a newfound interest in data workflow automation.”


	When the second question begins being typed out on screen, appears the Shakespeare in Love star shifts gears again, plugging the company's upcoming Beyond Analytics event in September.

	











	“We will now be returning to what we do best, which is delivering game-changing results for our customers,” Paltrow concludes. “Thank you for your interest in Astronomer.”


	The ad arrives in the wake of the July 15 Coldplay concert at Boston's Gillette Stadium, where a jumbotron caught Byron with his arm around Cabot during a kiss cam segment. When the pair realized they were on screen, Byron ducked out of view while Cabot quickly turned away. Both were married to other people at the time and have since resigned from the company.


	“Oh, look at these two,” Martin joked from the stage. “Oh, what? Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy.”

Former Anti-Flag frontman Justin Sane has been ordered to pay nearly $2 million in damages to a woman who alleged that he raped her in 2010, Rolling Stone reports and Pitchfork can confirm. The woman, Kristina Sarhadi, filed a lawsuit against Justin Sane, whose legal name is Justin Cathal Geever, in 2023, but the singer never responded to the complaint in court. As a result, Judge Brenda K. Sannes granted a default judgment against Justin Sane.

Judge Sannes handed down her ruling on Tuesday, July 22. She awarded Sarhadi $1,170,800 in damages related to her claims of assault, battery, and sexual battery. She awarded Sarhadi a further $750,000 in punitive damages. Judge Sannes also denied Sarhadi's motion for default judgment with respect to a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress. Pitchfork has reached out to Justin Sane and attorneys for Sarhadi for comment on the judgment.

Sarhadi initially filed her lawsuit in a New York state court, under New York's Adult Survivors Act, but the case was moved to a federal court at the beginning of 2024. In her complaint, Sarhadi alleged that Justin Sane “strangled her, forced her to perform oral sex on him, and raped her” at a motel when she was 21 years old.

Sarhadi's lawsuit arrived months after Anti-Flag's sudden breakup. Justin Sane's former bandmates eventually explained that allegations of sexual assault contributed to the group's dissolution. Justin Sane denied that he committed sexual assault, but numerous women, including Sarhadi, soon came forward to speak with Rolling Stone about Justin Sane's allegedly predatory and abusive behavior.

Columnist/International Editor At Large


EXCLUSIVE: Gurinder Chadha reveals to Deadline that a sequel to her celebrated 2002 film Bend It Like Beckham, which starred Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley, is officially in the works. “I'm excited to revisit the original characters and revive the enduring story and build on the legacy we helped to create for the women's game,” the London-based director confirms.


	Chadha adds that Nagra, Knightley, Archie Punjabi, Juliet Stevenson and other members of the original cast “are aware that a sequel is being developed, but they obviously want to see a script before they commit.

	“I'm pretty certain that everyone's going to want to come back,” she adds hopefully.

	“Everything hinges on the script and if the original cast likes it,” Chadha says. “I am working really hard to make sure every character I bring back has a decent arc and scenes.”


	The filmmaker was in Basel, Switzerland, ahead of tomorrow's Women's European Championship final where England women's soccer team faces Spain — a repeat of their 2023 World Cup clash — she tells us that for 23 years “I didn't want to do anything because I didn't have a story. And then I came up with a great story, really super-cool story. So now I'm inspired. Literally came up with it just about a month ago. It's my very clear wish to bring the characters back very,very soon.Women's football is more competitive ,more exciting, and more global than ever.It is an honor for me to be a small part of it.”


	Chadha has been toying around with the prospect of a follow-up feature or television drama for two years, encouraged by the phenomenal increase in worldwide support for women's football.


	The aim, Chadha says, is to have the sequel ready by 2027 to mark the 25th anniversary of Bend it Like Beckham's 2002 UK opening. It's a key year for the game, with the FIFA Women's World Cup tournament set to kick off in host nation Brazil from June 24-July 25 that year.

	











	The original film was based on a screenplay she co-wrote with Guljit Bindra and her husband Paul Mayeda Berges.


	Chadha and Berges have begun discussing the screenwriting process. “I'm hoping to write it with Paul, who has come up with some very funny lines like he did last time.”


	During this year's Cannes Film Festival, Chadha was introduced to Emma Hayes, who took over as head coach of the U.S. women's national soccer team in June. They subsequently met and chatted a few times and are now working “collaboratively” on the sequel. “Her insights into the world of football at her level are invaluable,” Chadha explains.


	Hayes says that Bend it Like Beckham has had a “massive impact” on her life. “I was Keira Knightley in Bend it. I cried in the cinema watching the film because I felt just like Jess and Jules,” the characters Nagra and Knightley played in the movie.


	”There was no hope for women's football in Britain then so I was going to the States to try my luck. Twenty three years ago I could never have dreamed of how much that film changed the women's game and now I have the best job in the world- head coach of the U.S. Women's national team,” Hayes notes. The top sportswoman adds that she's happy to be  “helping Gurinder with all my experience and insight into the game.”




	The project also has won support from Lisa Nandy MP, Britain's Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, who lauds Bend It Like Beckham for capturing “something so special about Britain — our spirit, our diversity, and our ability to dream big in the face of challenge.”


	Nandy adds that Chadha's story “resonated far beyond the screen and became part of our cultural DNA.”


	The Cabinet member's statement notes that the announcement “of a sequel is a brilliant moment for British film. It builds on a legacy that continues to inspire and shows the world what British storytelling can do. Films like this help tell our national story, remind us who we are, and who we can be.”


	Indeed the film has become a cultural touchstone over the years, with many of the leading lights in the world of women's soccer proclaiming Bend It Like Beckham as their main source of inspiration back in the day when the amateur antics of women playing soccer were laughed at. Since then the sport has become huge, with millions following professional women's clubs and national teams around the world.


	Chadha smiles ruefully as she recounts how with the first film she “couldn't even get arrested making it. Everyone was like, ‘We're not interested. Who wants to see a film about girls playing football?' Everyone laughed me out of the rooms.”


	For her, the original film “was about lifting up girls and saying, ‘You can do and you can be anything you want even though society dictates what you can and can't do,' and that message is still relevant today, even though we have women and women's soccer sides so huge around the world. The film's been part of that legacy, and I feel there's more that I can do. So that's what I'm writing and that's what I'm focusing on. It will be hard-hitting, of course, but it will also be incredibly joyous.


	“Let's hope we can bring back that same joy and feel good about putting women and girls on the map like we did 23 years ago.”

	











	In Bend It Like Beckham, Nagra plays Jasminder, a teenager besotted with soccer sensation David Beckham — then a player with Manchester United and the England men's squad — who is determined to play soccer against the wishes of her parents. Knightley plays her friend Jules, who also likes to land the ball at the back of the net. 


	Jonathan Rhys Meyers was cast as the fictional Hounslow Harriers team manager. 


	Chadha's latest film Christmas Karma starring Eva Longoria, Kunal Nayyar, Hugh Bonneville Charithra Chandran and Danny Dyer, will be released by True Brit Entertainment in UK and Ireland on November 14. Negotiations for other territories including the U.S., Australia and India are being finalized.

If you're not watching “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” right now, you're missing appointment television. To say the gloves have come off since Colbert's cancellation announcement last week would be a gross understatement. Not that Colbert really ever held back on his opinions, but a host scorned hath more fury.

On Thursday, July 24, he even introduced a monologue cut-away segment “Show Un-Cancelled.” Of course, that announcement turns out to be a fake-out — and the graphic used for it supposedly cost $40 million. That one's light hearted — no more scathing than what “Arrested Development” threw down in its last season on Fox (anyone old enough to remember that reference?). Throughout the first week of shows as a fallen angel, however, Colbert repeatedly seemed to play chicken with his network, CBS, and its parent company, Paramount, which just got the OK from the Trump Justice Department for a merger with Skydance (set to close August 7.) Not only did he reference the cancellation and the Skydance deal numerous times, he also went even harder on Trump.

An then the other late night shows went just as hard (or harder) on CBS and Paramount. On Monday, July 21, most of the other hosts even appeared in a Colbert segment, showcasing support for their competitor. References abounded in their own segments — some humorous, some ominous warnings — including some strong words from Jon Stewart on “The Daily Show,” which airs on fellow Paramount property Comedy Central.

 










“Shows that say something, shows that take a stand, shows that are unafraid — this is not a ‘We speak truth to power.' We don't. We speak opinions to television cameras. But we try. We fucking try, every night,” Stewart said. “And if you believe, as corporations or as networks, you can make yourself so innocuous that you can serve a gruel so flavorless that you will never again be on the boy king's radar — A) Why will anyone watch you? And [B)] you are fucking wrong.”

Fellow hosts Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel, meanwhile, seem to be next on Trump's cancellation wish list — considering he called for their cancellation and all. Fallon has been on vacation, and therefore has not had a monologue with which to respond. He did, however, write a statement that told the network, “Fuck you and all your Sheldons CBS.”

On the July 21 show, Fallon said, “I am your host, well… at least for tonight. I don't like it. I don't like what's going on one bit.”

Fallon did get in a dig at CBS' streaming platform, adding, “And many people are now threatening to boycott the network. Yep. CBS could lose millions of viewers plus tens of hundreds watching on Paramount+.” “The Tonight Show” host also sang about Trump's continued Epstein drama and his late night interests in the song below.

 










Comedy Central seems to have gotten the last laugh — so far, at least — on the whole debacle. The AI-segment seen 'round the world this week came courtesy of “South Park,” who delivered perhaps the most blistering satire of President Donald Trump yet. This came just hours after the series closed a deal with Paramount to continue for another five years, and just a day before the Justice Department approved the merger. The Wednesday, July 23 episode of “South Park” also spoke quite literally to the Skydance deal in a scene involving none other than Jesus Christ.

“You guys saw what happened to CBS,” Christ mutters through gritted teeth. “Well guess who owns CBS? Paramount! You really want to end up like Colbert?

Then on July 25, former “Late Show” legend David Letterman, Colbert's predecessor, chimed in on his YouTube channel.

“I don't think it was money… it was pure cowardice,” Letterman said, going on to praise “precise, crisp, witty political satirist” Colbert. He then addressed CBS/Paramount's decision, saying “What the fuck is Skydance, honest to Christ? Is it a discount airline? Is that what it is? I think one day, if not today, the people at CBS, who have manipulated and handled this are going to be embarrassed because this is this is gutless. I only wish this could happen to me… Fighting with network television management was number one in the playbook.”

 










But no one went harder on Paramount than Colbert himself. In its statements discussing “The Late Show” cancellation, Paramount repeatedly made mention of the show's $40 million annual losses. This figure has been questioned, and it was a number referenced repeatedly by Colbert all week.

“I could see us losing $24 million, but where could Paramount have possibly spent the other 16… Oh yeah,” he said on the July 21 episode. 

In the July 23 episode, he referenced how Trump claimed that CBS/Paramount would be providing another $20 million a year in administration-approved airtime.

“By bending the knee, they lost like $40 million this year,” Colbert said. “They better watch out. They might get canceled for purely financial reasons.”

This was just the tip of the iceberg for Colbert. It almost seems as if the stalwart late night presence is daring CBS to cancel him before May 2026, an idea also postured this week by Time. Certainly his tone was not one that sounds… uh, let's say copasetic, with his employers. 

But you be the judge. What's Colbert's game? Here's a few of his daring comments from the week's shows, mined from his full monologues:

“Over the weekend it sunk in that they're killing off our show. But they made one mistake: They left me alive!”

 










“All the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't hide who Dumpty humped with his friend.”

“It's not a great look when you fly on the pedophile's plane enough times to earn diamond pervert status.”

“What are you gonna tell me next — that the Pope is in the Catholic files? That a bear is on the cover of this month's Modern Woods Pooper?”

And of course, he did also say succinctly, “The President was buddies with a pedophile.”

The gloves certainly are off.

Outside of 'Deadpool & Wolverine,' the reboot looks to score the best domestic opening for Kevin Feige's superhero studio since 2022's 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.'  


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	Mister Fantastic and his family have cleared the launch pad in high style.


	Director Matt Shakman‘s Fantastic Four: First Steps topped Friday's box office chart in North America with a huge $57 million, ahead of tracking and putting it on course for a franchise-best debut in the $120 million-$125 million range in a seminal win for Kevin Feige‘s Marvel Studios (rivals are betting on the higher end). And it's already crossed the $100 million mark globally after earning $49.2 million in its first few days overseas for an early worldwide tally of $106.2 million through Friday.

	The acclaimed superhero pic boasts the second-biggest opening day of the year to date domestically behind A Minecraft Movie ($57.1 million). That included $24.4 million in Thursday previews, which was the best preview gross of the year to date after supplanting DC's Superman ($22.5 million), and the biggest preview number for any movie since fellow Marvel title Deadpool & Wolverine a year ago ($38.5 million). 


	The early performance of First Steps, which is winning over critics and audiences, is welcome news for the Disney-owned Marvel, where Feige and his team are looking for redemption after a rough few years (Deadpool & Wolverine being the exception). If projections hold — and again, besides Deadpool 3 — the Fantastic Four reboot will mark the best domestic opening for Marvel since 2022's Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. And so far, the movie is pacing slightly head of Superman.


	Also on Friday, Disney became the first Hollywood studio to cross $3 billion in global ticket sales. 

	











Superman debuted to a successful $125 million domestically two weeks ago and $95 million overseas, where it is coming in behind expectations due to the pro-American themes long tied to the comic-book character. Fantastic Four should have an upper hand over Superman overseas internationally, considering that the previous films in the franchise made by 20th Century Fox did more of their business offshore.


	The New York City-set First Steps, which is earning raves for its early 1960s retro-style, stars Pedro Pascal as scientific genius Reed Richards, who leads a space expedition with his wife, Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby); her brother, Johnny Storm (Joseph Quinn); and piloted by their good friend Ben Grimm (Ebon Moss-Bachrach). When their rocket ship encounters a cosmic storm, it alters their DNA, returning them to Earth with superpowers.


	The new film picks up after the four have returned and have become become worldwide heroes. But there is no time to rest on their laurels. They must return to space when Earth is visited by the Silver Surfer (Julia Garner), who warns that the planet is about to be destroyed by a cosmic entity named Galactus.


	In terms of the box office, the hope is that Fantastic Four will play to both families and fanboys/fangirls alike, which should help combat lingering superhero fatigue at the box office. It's earning glowing responses from moviegoers, including an A- CinemaScore, stellar exits on PostTrak and a 93 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. Reviewers are responding much the same. “The pleasing back-to-basics feel in The Fantastic Four: First Steps suggests Marvel has learned valuable lessons from its recent box office underperformers. There's a fresh willingness to prioritize character over the usual barrage of interchangeable CG action sequences that often overwhelm them, instead giving us relatable folks to invest in,” Hollywood Reporter chief film critic David Rooney writes in his review. “The eponymous quartet may have superpowers, but they are also a family, struggling like most of us to handle the most daunting responsibilities life throws our way.”

	











	Elsewhere, Superman is holding in nicely even as it loses Imax screens to Fantastic Four. The DC and Warner Bros. pic should finish its third weekend with nearly $300 million in domestic ticket sales and north of $500 million globally. 


	Universal and Amblin's Jurassic World: Rebirth is also celebrating. It will cross $300 million domestically this weekend after clearing $600 million globally a week ago.

Bad Bunny kicked off the third week of his Puerto Rican residency No Me Quiero Ir De Aqui with a show-stopping performance and two special guests: rising star Young Miko and salsa legend Gilberto Santa Rosa both came out to a roaring crowd and joined Benito onstage for a pair of songs.

Young Miko came out first, during a portion of the concert that takes place in a little pink house called La Casita. That part of the concert is designed to play out like a raging house party, with Miko popping out of the house to hop on the mic with Benito for their collab “Fina.” The two of them traded bars and danced around other house party guests (at past shows, that area has been filled with people like LeBron James, Ricky Martin, and Kylian Mbappé.)

	Every night of the residency ends with an energetic salsa showdown that includes Bad Bunny‘s No. 1 Hit “BAILE INoLVIDABLE.” The crowd broke out into screams when salsa legend Gilberto Santa Rosa strolled onstage unexpectedly to perform a verse of the song, and then stayed for a rendition of his classic “La Agarro Bajando.” Both stars emphasized the vibe of the setlist, which combines Puerto Rican traditions with modern sounds. It highlighted artists like Santa Rosa, who Bad Bunny has been a longtime fan of (the salsa veteran also just collaborated on a salsa song with J Balvin.)

	It's also a reminder of the rising stars Bad Bunny has long endorsed. Back in 2023, when Bad Bunny curated Rolling Stone's Future 25 list, he picked Young Miko as an artist to watch. “Young Miko is a new face that's breaking through, and I like her a lot,” he said at the time. ” I feel like she has so much to show people, like she hasn't showed people all her tricks yet.” Since then, Young Miko has become a massive breakout act, snagging a Latin Grammy nomination and acclaim for her debut album att., which came out last year.

The Live '25 tour rolled into London and saw the group on red-hot form.


													By
												

	Thomas Smith



Oasis and Wembley Stadium go way back. The iconic football stadium in northwest London is, for many, the pinnacle of an artist's career. Everyone from Taylor Swift to Michael Jackson have dominated the 90,000-capacity ground. Come late August, Coldplay will hold the record with 16 sold-out shows.


	Back in 2000 the Gallagher brothers swaggered Wembley Way for their maiden appearance — but Liam was distinctly unimpressed. “If you think I'm over the moon to be here, then you must be trippin,'” he said on the second of their two-night stand, later calling it a “s—t hole.” This was prior to the stadium's renovation, and the band returned in 2009 on their final tour.


	But that 2000 show — dubbed one of their most “disastrous” shows — still lives long in the memory. It was immortalised on the Familiar to Millions live LP and broadcast live on U.K. television. The show included instances of LG mouthing off about his divorce (“I don't even have a f—g teabag to my name”) and whatever substances were rattling around the dressing room (“I'm in one of them moods,” he warned). The performance itself was sloppy and languid compared to their previous highs at Maine Road and Knebworth in 1996.


	A quarter of a century later, the vibes could not be more different. The band's Live ‘25 tour — which has so far visited Cardiff and Manchester — has seen them on red-hot form: Liam's vocals are on top notch, Noel and the rest of the band's playing is as unified as its been for decades and, thus far, no dramas from the pair. They're sounding crisper and more energised as the tour rolls on, and the U.K. public are properly mad fer it, as they dominate the Albums Chart once more and the populus proudly sport Oasis-branded clobber.


	These were the best moments from Oasis' opening night on Friday (July 25) at Wembley Stadium on the band's Live ‘25 reunion tour.


	Over the years, “Acquiesce” has only grown in stature. The 1995 song was a B-Side to “Some Might Say,” their first U.K. No. 1 single, and became a firm fixture in their live sets. Over the decades it has become utterly beloved and the shared vocals between Noel and Liam sum up their messy love-hate relationship: “Because we need each other/ We believe in one another.” Before the second chorus, Noel gave a little hand wave to encourage the audience to sing louder than they ever had before — they obliged, of course.


	The tour's kick-off in Cardiff earlier this month (July 5) had an air of mystery — and tightness, perhaps. Now the boys are feeling comfortable back on stage together, arriving on stage arm-in-arm again, and chatting with the audience just like old times. “I seem to get myself in a lot of trouble these days,” Liam said, perhaps referencing his quip about the Coldplay kiss cam scandal earlier this week. Before “Don't Look Back in Anger” Noel paid tribute to his favourite boozer The Chiltern Firehouse in London, which suffered a fire earlier this year, and dedicated the song to all the barmaids. We weren't getting this level of chat on opening night.


	Mockingly dubbed “the hokey-cokey” by Liam, the crowd performing the “Poznan” has become a highlight of the Live ‘25 reunion tour. The celebration adopted by their beloved soccer team Man City involves facing away from the stage, linking arms and bouncing up and down in unison. It made for a bizarre but brilliant sight as the T Rex-aping riff kicked into gear — and even won over fans of some of City's biggest rivals.


	Their 2002 LP Heathen Chemistry isn't quite considered a classic, but it does pack bursts of greatness and some of their best post-90s material. “Little by Little” is one such song, a bitter, furious ballad that brought to a close Noel's section in the middle of the set (alongside “Talk Tonight” and “Half the World Away”) and gave one last look in daylight as the sun set on the Wembley crowd. “Stand By Me,” which featured on a bank advert in the U.K. in recent years, was sung (and screamed) with similar gusto.


	The group's Live ‘25 tour dates thus far have been opened by Britpop band Cast, and Richard Ashcroft formerly of the Verve. The latter served as the inspiration for “Cast No Shadow” from 1995's (What's The Story) Morning Glory?, and paints a picture of a man caught in the wrong time and place but stumbling through life against the tide of adversity. Ashcroft's peaks as a songwriter in the ‘90s were as high as Gallagher's (“Bittersweet Symphony” and “Sonnet”), and it's only right that he's in the room to witness the outpouring of love for a song written in his honour.


	Few rocked harder than the late Ozzy Osbourne — and Liam and Noel know that. During “Live Forever,” the band paid tribute to the Black Sabbath singer who died on July 22, aged 76, by placing an image of him on screen during the song's outro. The following song “Rock'n'Roll Star” was dedicated by Liam to the Prince of Darkness, too.


	The band's 1995 song is something of a parody of itself — how can a song like that get so big and still remain sincere? Even Liam acknowledged it as he jokingly introduced it as “that wretched song.” The crowd didn't seem to mind, and when Liam stepped away from the mic during the chorus to let the audience sing the words it sent chills through the body.

	While Astronomer lost their CEO and HR exec amid the Coldplay concert viral scandal, their marketing team has picked up the slack with a clever new ad that enlists Gwyneth Paltrow, the ex-wife of Chris Martin.


	Hours after the tech company's chief human resources officer Kristin Cabot resigned, Astronomer's socials posted the ad starring Paltrow as a “temporary spokesperson” to let the public know what exactly the now-popular company does.


	“Thank you for your interest in Astronomer,” the actress says. “I've been hired on a very temporary basis to speak on behalf of the 300-plus employees at Astronomer. Astronomer has gotten a lot of questions over the last few days, and they wanted me to answer the most common ones.”

	The questions include “OMG. What the f-” and “How is your social media team hold-,” with Paltrow sidestepping the scandal and instead offering answering about the company itself.

	“We are thrilled so many people have an interest in data workflow automation,” Paltrow adds. “We will now be returning to what we do best: Delivering game-changing results for our customers. Thank you for your interest in Astronomer.”


	Andy Byron, the now-former CEO of Astronomer, resigned last week after he and Cabot were put on leave following the viral moment during Coldplay's Boston-area concert.

	In the widely seen and frequently-meme'd moment caught on jumbotron, Byron and Cabot looked to be caught off-guard when their embrace was seen by more than 50,000 people at Gillette Stadium. Their immediate reaction was to duck and turn away from the camera and leaving the frame, which likely led to the speculation and suspicions over their non-professional-appearing relationship.

	











	Coldplay's shows feature “The Jumbotron Song,” where Chris Martin riffs about whomever is captured on the camera. In a clip filmed during the incident, Martin — who was married to Paltrow for 13 years before their “conscious uncoupling” — joked from the stage, “Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy.”

The doctor who tried to save the late Malcolm-Jamal Warner is sharing his story. The doctor recalled how he pulled Warner out of the “rough” Costa Rica ocean and brought him to shore.

A post shared by Jennifer Hudson (@iamjhud)

In a July 2025 interview with Us Weekly, the doctor, who asked not to be identified by name, shared that he was enjoying his vacation at the time of the incident.

“I was about 200 meters from the incident, at Playa Grande, spending the day on vacation with my partner,” he recalled. “There were very few people on the beach, and the sea was rough.”

According to the outlet, the doctor heard people calling for help. “I ran to the area and entered the sea with my surfboard, heading into the rip current toward the person being pointed at by some beachgoers,” the doctor shared. 

He continued, “After a few minutes, I saw a shadow, dove down and pulled the person out.”

The doctor got back to the beach and found another man lying on the sand who was struggling to breathe. “[He was] just someone who tried to help during the emergency, without any rescue equipment,” the doctor noted.

He went on to describe the emergency personnel who arrived on scene. “Immediately, [first responders] began providing first aid to Malcolm, but he had no vital signs,” the doctor recalled. 

He added, “Two tourists ran over to help. They identified themselves as doctors, making a total of three physicians at the scene.”

Red Cross personnel arrived and used specialized equipment, including a defibrillator, but Warner did not respond. He was pronounced dead at the scene at age 54.

The other man was transported to a local medical clinic and was later released.

“The people who take part in this kind of rescue are always deeply affected,” the doctor shared. “You have to understand it's not easy, and it also takes time to heal.”

A post shared by Yvette Nicole Brown (@yvettenicolebrown)

Elberth León, head of the Tourist Police for Costa Rica's Atlantic region, initially said Warner's 8-year-old daughter was in the water with him and was rescued, but new reports say otherwise.

Costa Rica's Judicial Investigation Agency (OIJ) confirmed she was on the shore at the time of the incident, People reports.

“Mr. Warner was playing with his daughter at the seashore at one point. He then left her out of the water, and he and a friend of his entered the sea,” the statement read.

“It was at that moment that they were swept away by the current, and the friend managed to get out,” the statement noted. “However, Mr. Warner was unable to get out and was pulled out by several people on the beach. He received care from Red Cross officials, but was pronounced dead at the scene.”

The actor's cause of death was ruled “asphyxiation by submersion.”

Dave Letterman has never been shy about letting TV network management know when they're being idiots, assholes, or any other flavor of pinhead. (Indeed, at least part of the man's mystique, as he himself would note, runs on his love of battling with and tweaking his various corporate overlords over the years.) So it's not entirely shocking to hear Letterman go hard after CBS over its recent conduct vis a vis his successor Stephen Colbert, calling the decision to cancel Colbert's Late Show last week both “gutless” and an act of “pure cowardice.”

﻿

Letterman was in conversation with his long-time friend and collaborator, Late Show executive producer Barbara Gaines, as well as My Next Guest Needs No Introduction executive producer Mary Barclay, when he launched enthusiastically into the topic. Laying out his own (slightly idiosyncratic) view of events—he remains convinced, against all evidence, Barclay's protests, and in the service of comedy, that Skydance Media is run by twin brothers—Letterman says he doesn't buy that CBS's decision to tell Colbert his current season will be his last was financially motivated. “You're telling me losing this kind of money happened yesterday?” he rhetorically asks, noting, with agreement from veteran producer Gaines, that there are plenty of ways late night shows can tighten budgets before going to the nuclear option. In Letterman's view, the timing is just too obvious: Skydance (which just got FCC approval for its merger with Paramount, which is set to conclude early next month) didn't want a repeat of what went down with Donald Trump's CBS News lawsuit, and so pre-emptively got rid of Colbert before he could continue to deploy his “precise, quick, witty” satirical abilities on Trump's hide.

Hilariously, Letterman actually sounds just a tad jealous of Colbert for being dropped into such a clear and obvious hero position, noting that he's “a martyr” who's basically had his position in the TV Hall Of Fame permanently set. (“I only wish this has happened to me,” Letterman says at one point, only half-sounding like he was joking. “This would have been so great for me.”) All told, it's a withering takedown of the “bottom feeders” Letterman condemns at Skydance (delivering a classically Letterman “What the fuck is Skydance? Is it a discount airline?” in the process).

Lasers, Nine Inch Nails and light cycles all dominated during the film's Comic-Con debut.

	Before Jeff Bridges got to the set of Tron: Ares, he was informed that his co-star Jared Leto would prefer to be addressed by his character, Ares. The Oscar-winner is known for his method acting ways.


	“He's one of those guys. Everyone has different methods and modes man,” said Bridges to laughs during Tron: Ares' laser-heavy presentation at San Diego Comic-Con Friday.




	“I didn't want to offend him as a thespo,” Bridges continued, addressing Leto, who is known as a method actor. “But I thought, ‘I wanted to have a certain intimacy with you. I know your name is Ares. Can I just call you Air?' He said, ‘Yeah man! You can call me whatever you want!' We had a great time.”

	Leto, for his part, recalled the first scene he had with Bridges. “I just blurted out, ‘cut!' Everyone was surprised, because I don't often do that. The first AD comes over and said, ‘Is everything OK? What's wrong?' And I said, ‘You know, I just can't stop smiling, because I'm working with my guy.'”

Tron: Ares, from director Joachim Rønning, arrives Oct. 10 and unlike the original films, in which our heroes enter the digital world known as the Grid, this film has programs from the Grid arriving in the real world. It is a big swing for Disney, as while the 1982 original Tron became a cult classic, it was not a hit. Neither was 2010 sequel Tron: Legacy. Still, the property, created by writer-director Steven Lisberger, has endured. “My feeling about Tron is the most important thing is we kick this technology around artistically before it kicks us around,” said Lisberger to applause.

	











	The Tron films have been known for their unique scores, with Daft Punk's work on Tron: Legacy now considered a classic. Nine Inch Nails stepped into the role for Ares, but moderator Kevin Smith jokingly asked why Leto wasn't involved in the score.


	“You guys didn't think to reach out to, Jared? I hear he likes music as well,” Smith said to laughs, referencing Leto's career as the frontman of rock band 30 Seconds to Mars.


	Leto, who spent years developing the project as a star and producer, gave credit to the Daft Punk score from 15 years ago.


	“When we were talking about music for this film, there was really very few people you could think about that could fill those shoes. Nine Inch Nails absolutely did it. They made music that will last a lifetime,” said Leto.


	Indeed, the Tron: Ares panel suggests that the score will live up to the legacy, with lengthy, effects-heavy clips to the film backed by Nine Inch Nails impressing the crowd.


	There were plenty of moments of comedy during the panel, with Bridges in full “The Dude” mode, harkening back to his The Big Lebowski Character. “The Grid abides,” Smith said at one point, with Bridges agreeing, “The Grid abides.”


	Between Smith and Bridges, pretty much everyone on the panel was addressed as, “man,” multiple times, including co-star Greta Lee.


	At another point, Smith made a reference to star Lee's acclaimed romantic drama Past Lives, joking the script to Ares must have reminded her of that film.

	











	Lee, who is new to Comic-Con and was surprised the Past Lives joke landed for that crowd, said “I told my agents just find something where I can ride a light cycle.” Which, as the audience in Hall H saw, she does indeed do in the new movie.

The disgraced singer was held liable by default in the case.


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



Justin Sane, the former lead singer of defunct political punk band Anti-Flag, has been ordered to pay $1.9 million to a woman he's accused of raping in 2010.


	A Tuesday (July 22) federal court order holds Sane (born Justin Geever) liable by default because he's failed to respond to the assault and sexual battery lawsuit brought in 2023 by a woman named Kristina Sarhadi.


	Sarhadi alleges Sane strangled and raped her at a motel in 2010, after they met at an Anti-Flag show at The Bell House in Brooklyn. She was the first of a dozen women to come forward with sexual misconduct claims against Sarhadi in July 2023, causing the avowedly “straight-edge,” pro-feminism band Anti-Flag to split up after 35 years.


	Sane denied Sarhadi's claims as “categorically false” back in 2023, but he never took any action in the lawsuit. Judge Brenda K. Sannes has therefore entered default judgment against Sane, a legal outcome where defendants are found to have effectively admitted to the claims against them by failing to respond despite repeated warnings.


	The Tuesday order requires Sane to pay Sarhadi $1.9 million in damages, including $750,000 for pain and suffering and $420,800 for the costs of therapy to address post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety stemming from the 2010 rape.


	“It is well-documented through the supporting affidavits that plaintiff has suffered extreme emotional distress and a complete upending of her life, as evidenced by her symptoms which have persisted fifteen years since the date of the attack,” writes Judge Sannes.


	The damages figure also includes $750,000 in punitive damages, which a judge can institute to punish or deter a defendant for behavior that's beyond the pale.


	“The sexual violence committed by the defendant undeniably constitutes morally reprehensible or utterly reckless behavior making a punitive damage award proper,” writes the judge. “Defendant sexually assaulted plaintiff and shattered her emotional well-being, causing life-long ramifications years after the attack.”


	“Defendant's conduct is even more morally reprehensible because he used his fame and status to lure a much younger fan into his hotel room under false pretenses,” adds Judge Sannes.


	Sane could not be reached for comment on Friday (July 25). Sarhadi's attorney did not return a request for comment on the judgment.


	Sarhadi's lawsuit originally alleged that the other former members of Anti-Flag — Chris Head, Chris Barker and Pat Thetic — should have known about Sane's repeated sexual misconduct but failed to put a stop to it. But Judge Sannes dismissed Sarhadi's claims against Anti-Flag's corporate entity, Hardwork Distribution Inc., this past December after finding that she had not adequately pled negligence on the band's part.


Stuart Slotnick, a lawyer representing Head, Barker and Thetic, told Billboard on Friday that his clients “have had no contact with Geever at all (nor do they wish to)” since the sexual assault allegations came to light.


	“They were shocked to hear the complaints,” Slotnick says. “We were very happy that the judge recognized that the three former members of the band had nothing to do with Geever or his misdeeds.”

The wrestling world is still reeling from the loss of WWE icon Hulk Hogan, who died on July 24 at the age of 71. But the grief is especially profound for those closest to him, his family and his wife, Sky Daily, who is mourning the man she lovingly called her partner and heart.

Before becoming husband & wife, Hogan and Daily shared a whirlwind love story that began with a chance meeting at a party. The pair were reunited by mutual friends Corin Nemec and Sabrina Nova, who later played matchmakers and watched their friends fall in love.

In a memorable speech at Nemec's wedding, Hogan announced his own engagement to the crowd.

“She was crazy enough to say ‘Yes,' brother,” Hogan quipped, nodding to his signature catchphrase. According to The Los Angeles Times, the WWE Hall of Famer had proposed just three days earlier over dinner, presenting Sky with a diamond ring.

Hogan, whose real name was Terry Gene Bollea, married Daily in an intimate ceremony in Clearwater, Florida, in September 2023.

As seen in photos obtained by TMZ, the couple maintained an elegant yet simple style. Hogan wore a classic black tuxedo, paired with his signature black bandana, while Sky stunned in a strapless, glittery white gown by Rue de Seine, featuring a sweetheart neckline and a lace train. The small wedding reflected their deep bond, far from the spotlight of the wrestling ring.

Daily, a yoga instructor and mother of three, had been by Hogan's side throughout his final chapter. The couple's love story began after a casual thank-you turned into something more. Sky had approached Hogan to express gratitude after he bought drinks for their group, and the spark ignited from there.

Later, Hogan would credit Nova for encouraging him to call Sky after their first meeting. That call led to a relationship that eventually became one of the most important in his life.

Following Hogan's death, Daily shared an emotional tribute, saying her “heart is in pieces.”

“This loss is sudden and impossible to process,” she wrote. “To the world, he was a legend… but to me, he was my Terry. The man I loved. My partner. My heart.”

As fans across the globe remember Hulk Hogan for his legendary career, Sky Daily remembers him as the man behind the fame, the one she planned a future with.

The members of prolific Australian rock band King Gizzard And The Wizard Lizard announced this afternoon that they were pulling their music from Spotify, specifically citing the actions and investments of streaming service CEO Daniel Ek. Writing that Ek “invests millions in AI military drone technology,” the band announced on Instagram that “We just removed our music from the platform. Can we put pressure on these Dr. Evil tech bros to do better? Join us on another platform.”

The group is the latest band to pull their music from the service over Ek, and specifically his Prima Materia investment fund, which recently raised more than $600 million in funding for military drone developer Helsing. (Ek is also chairman of Helsing, which started as an AI software developer before moving into creating and manufacturing its own drones.) Previously, bands Deerhoof and Bay Area indie band Xiu Xiu announced they were making similar moves to pull their music from the service. (Xiu Xiu's statement on their own decision, which they announced yesterday, goes even harder than King Gizzard's, with the band writing that “Although the financial practices of all streaming services is acutely anti-musician, the actions of Spotify to use the profits they made from essentially stealing music in order to murder people to make even more money is almost beyond comprehension.”)

King Gizzard actually made two announcements on social media today, also announcing that they were releasing a new collection of demos “Out everywhere except Spotify (fuck Spotify),” and adding, true to the spirit of the thing, “You can bootleg it if you wanna.” The band recently released its 27th album, Phantom Island, and is currently in the midst of an American leg of a 2025 world tour.

The triple j Hottest 100 of Australian Songs countdown is over!

Following the annual Hottest 100 at the start of the year, Triple J's next big countdown was all about homegrown music.

This special edition mid-year poll was “dedicated to the homegrown artists and tracks that have resonated across generations, and helped define our nation's sound.”

In the end, INXS were declared the winner, triumphing for their classic song “Never Tear Us Apart”.

Triple j Music Director Nick Findlay said: “Never Tear Us Apart hits just as hard in 2025 as it did almost 40 years ago. It's a song that Australians of all ages can relate to, one that has soundtracked countless memories, and a defining piece of music history we can all celebrate together.

“Seeing iconic anthems from the likes of Paul Kelly, The Angels and Missy Higgins stand side by side as equals with modern day classics like Innerbloom, Better in Blak and The Less I Know The Better, has highlighted what we all know – Australia is the home of the best music ever written!”

Earlier this month, astronomers made a fascinating discovery: a mysterious object with interstellar origins, now dubbed 3I/ATLAS, that's hurtling toward the inner solar system at extreme speeds.

As scientists race to get a better understanding of the rare visitor — it's only the third confirmed interstellar object to have ventured into our solar system — some intriguing theories have emerged.

One particularly eyebrow-raising possibility beyond the mainstream suggestions of it being either a comet or an asteroid, as championed by Harvard astronomer and alien hunter Avi Loeb, is that 3I/ATLAS could have been sent by an intelligent, extraterrestrial civilization.

In a yet-to-be-peer-reviewed paper, Loeb analyzed the possibility that the object is "alien technology," highlighting its unusual trajectory and what he says may be attempts to brake itself to have a closer look at Earth and Jupiter. (He also emphasized that it might just be a comet or space rock.)

"The orbital path of 3I/ATLAS has some very unlikely combination of characteristics, which could quite easily have been simple coincidence, as extremely strange as that ostensibly appears," the paper reads.

But Loeb — who previously wrote an entire book about the possibility that 'Oumuamua, an interstellar object first observed in 2017, may have been sent to us by an alien civilization — and his colleagues stopped far short of concluding the latest discovery was an alien probe. In the paper, they argued that "this paper is largely a pedagogical exercise" and that "by far the most likely outcome will be that 3I/ATLAS is a completely natural interstellar object, probably a comet."

As Swinburne University of Technology lecturer Sara Webb argued in a piece for The Conversation, the idea that the intriguing object could have an extraterrestrial origin is an intriguing hypothesis, and shouldn't be discarded.

"The idea of alien probes wandering the cosmos may sound strange, but humans sent out a few ourselves in the 1970s," Webb wrote, pointing out that "both Voyager 1 and 2 have officially left our Solar System, and Pioneer 10 and 11 are not far behind."

"So it's not a stretch to think that alien civilisations — if they exist — would have launched their own galactic explorers," she concluded.

However, figuring out whether 3I/ATLAS is indeed an alien probe coming to visit our system isn't nearly as easy as it sounds. According to Webb, we'd start out by checking if the object has a "tail" like comets do.

Other than that, we could "look for signs of electrostatic discharge caused by sunlight hitting the probe" or "any kind of radio waves coming from the probe as a form of communication."

But in the absence of any clear indications that 3I/ATLAS is an alien visitor, Webb agrees with Loeb that, as intriguing as the alternative may be, there's a very good chance we're looking at a comet: a celestial wad of ice, dust, and rock.

"For now, 3I/ATLAS is likely just an unusually fast, old and icy visitor from a distant system," Webb concluded. "But it also serves as a test case: a chance to refine the way we search, observe and ask questions about the universe."

When we think of alien life, our minds often wander to the realm of science fiction, envisioning little green beings with oversized heads. Yet, the reality might be far more intriguing and microscopic. NASA is funding a groundbreaking study to explore the possibility of alien microbial life within our solar system, specifically on Jupiter's icy moon, Europa. Led by UMass Amherst microbiologist James Holden, this mission delves into the depths of Earth's oceanic mysteries to better understand what life might look like on Europa.

James Holden brings a wealth of knowledge to NASA's mission, having dedicated his career to studying rare microbes in Earth's deep-sea vents. These vents, located a mile below the ocean's surface, offer a unique environment devoid of light and oxygen—conditions that Holden believes could mirror those on Europa. The hydrothermal vents on Earth are home to specialized microbes that derive energy from the gases and minerals spewed by volcanic activity. Holden's laboratory at UMass Amherst is equipped to simulate these harsh conditions, providing insights into how life might thrive on Europa.

Holden's research focuses on the potential for life-supporting conditions beneath Europa's icy crust. Astronomers speculate that a salty, liquid ocean lies beneath Europa's frozen surface and that this ocean might be in contact with a hot, molten core. This interaction could create an environment similar to Earth's deep-sea vents, where life might flourish. With NASA's Europa Clipper satellite set to explore the moon's habitability, Holden's work is crucial in understanding what alien life could look like.

“NASA Sounds the Alarm”: Unprecedented Planetary Surge Linked to Unknown Deep-Earth Force Now Spreading at Global Scale



For decades, Holden has utilized submarines to collect microbial samples from the ocean floor, both human-occupied and robotic. These samples are brought back to his lab, where he recreates the extreme conditions found at deep-sea vents. “I've been investigating deep-sea volcanoes since 1988,” Holden states, emphasizing his commitment to uncovering Earth's microbial secrets. By examining these microbes' adaptations, Holden hopes to draw parallels to potential life forms on Europa.

The significance of this research extends beyond mere curiosity. Understanding these microbes' energy acquisition methods could reveal new biochemical pathways, which might be present in Europan life. Holden's lab has reconstructed lightless, oxygen-less conditions that mimic those of Europa, offering a glimpse into what alien life might entail. The mission embodies the excitement of discovering life beyond Earth, potentially revealing secrets hidden in our own planet's depths.

Holden's research also delves into the diverse chemical processes that might sustain Europan microbial life. On Earth, deep-sea microbes utilize hydrogenases—specialized enzymes that break down hydrogen for energy. However, the variability in hydrogenases' functions and interactions with elements like iron, sulfur, and carbon adds complexity to the study.

One of the challenges lies in understanding how these chemical processes contribute to an organism's physiology. The varied functions of hydrogenases in different microbial environments could result in significant differences in life forms. Holden's research aims to unravel these biochemical mysteries, shedding light on the potential diversity of life on Europa. By comprehending the chemistry that underpins these organisms, scientists can better predict what alien life might resemble.

As NASA's Europa Clipper embarks on its mission to assess Europa's habitability, Holden's research remains vital in guiding the exploration. The study of Earth's deep-sea vents provides a window into the potential for life in extraterrestrial environments. By understanding the conditions that support life on our planet, scientists can make educated assumptions about the possibilities elsewhere in our solar system.

Holden's work not only expands our knowledge of Earth's microbial diversity but also fuels the quest for discovering life beyond our world. The $621,000 NASA grant underscores the importance of this research, as it paves the way for understanding how life could survive in alien chemistries. As we stand on the brink of potentially uncovering life on Europa, one must wonder: What secrets do our own planet's depths hold, and what could they reveal about life in the universe?

Wow, $621k seems like a lot! Is it really worth it? 🤔

Thanks for the article! Fascinating to think life might exist on Europa.

Is this the best use of taxpayer money? What about issues on Earth?

As a sci-fi fan, I'm all for exploring Europa! 🚀

Why Europa and not another moon or planet?

Great article! Keep up the good work! 👍

Can microbes really survive in such extreme conditions?

Why aren't we funding more studies like this? The possibilities are endless!

Isn't this just a waste of time and resources? 🤨

The idea of alien life is thrilling. Go NASA! 🌌

An eyewitness to the supposed crash-landing of a UFO in a small Pennsylvania town nearly 60 years ago now claims investigators have made new, startling discoveries about the incident. 

On December 9, 1965, people in seven US states and Canada reported seeing a giant fiery object lighting up the night sky.

Ronnie Strubel, 82, lived in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, at the time and described it as a 'fireball with a red rooster tail behind it'.

Contrary to more recent reports where witnesses claim UFOs they saw were unnaturally quick, Strubel told Daily Mail the object he saw was moving about as fast as a commercial airplane.

Then, he said, it came down in a wooded area in the unincorporated town of Kecksburg, which lies in Westmoreland County.

'It only took like 15 or 20 minutes for us to get out to the site, and the military was already there,' he said. 

But in the decades since, this strange event likely seen by thousands of people has largely been erased from the collective memory.

That is, until the History Channel aired a documentary on the subject earlier this month, where a mix of experts used modern technology to uncover what may have happened all those years ago in Kecksburg.

Many locals who claim to have seen the UFO pass over Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, say it looked like an acorn (Pictured: A model of the UFO is seen displayed in town)

Kecksburg is a small, unincorporated town in Westmoreland County. The nearest big city is Pittsburgh

The 42-minute long episode, titled 'Pennsylvania's Roswell', was part of reality TV series Beyond Skinwalker Ranch, a show that focuses on sites around the country where there has been supposed paranormal activity.

Strubel and another local, Bill Weaver, were featured in the episode. During a shot near the crash site, Strubel told the same story, but Weaver added some more context about the government response.

'The police and the military, they were all over the place. And there were guys out there in dark suits. They were the ones that seemed to be in charge,' Weaver said.

'While we were standing there watching what was going on, the state police and the military came up to us and they told us, "If you don't move, we're going to confiscate your car." And I figured I better move,' he added.

Hosts Andy Bustamante, an ex-CIA officer, and Paul Beban, an award-winning journalist, unpacked much of the lore surrounding the UFO sighting and crash.

This included the persisting claim from longtime residents that the object they saw was shaped like an acorn.

An acorn-like model of the alleged UFO has been sitting outside the Kecksburg Volunteer Fire Station since the 1990, when it was created as a prop for the NBC show 'Unsolved Mysteries.'

They also discussed many of the explanations that were thrown out by the federal government in the days, months and years after the incident.

Pictured: The very first Greensburg Tribune-Review article on the Kecksburg UFO incident, dated December 10, 1965

Pictured: The History Channel team did a LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) scan of the ground near where the UFO was thought to have crashed. Technologist Pete Kelsey claimed that this blue area was abnormally flat compared to the rest of the surrounding topography

The team then returned to that exact spot with handheld spectrum analyzers to measure the radio waves. The reading on the left was taken from the flat area discovered by the LiDAR, while the reading on the right was taken just 20 feet away

Very early reports quoted astronomers claiming it was merely a meteor, but this didn't hold much credibility because of the unprecedented military presence documented by witnesses and local media.

NASA still maintains that it was likely a meteor, but also acknowledges speculation that it could have been Soviet satellite.

Beban said the strangest thing about the case was that it got plenty of media attention at the time before it 'faded from view' under 'a cloak of secrecy'.

Bustamante and Beban turned to the expertise of technologist Pete Kelsey in hopes that he would be able to uncover the exact site of the UFO crash.

Kelsey used LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) imaging from a drone and slam scanner to get a topographic map of the ground, which would reveal possible impact points.

Later, the team gathered to look at the results of the scan and found what Kelsey called a patch of 'man-made earth work'.

'It's level against this otherwise very steep slope. Straight lines, right angles. Those kinds of things do not occur in nature,' he said.

They then returned to that exact spot with handheld spectrum analyzers to measure the radio waves.

Strubel revealed the findings at this past weekend's 20th annual Kecksburg UFO Festival, an event he founded with permission from the fire department in 2005

The alleged crash site had a vastly different radio signature than a spot just 20 feet away, which had a flat frequency.

'This doesn't make any sense. How is there a radio signal in one place that doesn't exist just a few feet away? That's not how radio energy works,' Bustamante said. 

'We're getting even more evidence that suggests that there really was something strange that happened on this spot, in this ravine, in Kecksburg,' he added. 'We might have actually found the real crash site.'

Strubel revealed these findings at this past weekend's 20th annual Kecksburg UFO Festival, an event he founded with permission from the fire department in 2005. 

Strubel himself is a 50-year veteran of the Kecksburg Volunteer Fire Department, once serving as chief.

The three-day festival routinely attracts thousands of visitors from all over the United States and the world as a whole, he told Daily Mail.

'We've had people from Japan, from Germany, from England with this little town event that we have,' he said.

The first two days of the festival were not solely dedicated to the extraterrestrial, with attendees enjoying a cornhole competition, a parade, fireworks and even a hotdog eating contest.

'Years ago, we used to have a street fair, and that went to the wayside. And this was our idea for some kind of event to draw a little bit of money into the community. So we started the UFO Fest,' Strubel said. 

It remains unclear what truly happened in Kecksburg six decades ago, but the mythos surrounding the UFO crash is clearly buoying the area to this day.

It's been 50 years since Jimmy Hoffa first disappeared, and his case remains one of the most infamous and vexing unsolved mysteries in U.S. history.

The ex-Teamsters boss left his cottage home in suburban Lake Orion, Mich., near Detroit on July 30, 1975 for a 2 p.m. meeting at the Machus Red Fox Restaurant in nearby Bloomfield Hills.

He was reportedly gathering with a group of gangsters, including Anthony “Tony Pro” Provenzano, a New Jersey-based capo for the Genovese crime family, and Detroit mob boss Anthony “Tony Jack” Giacalone. Hoffa was trying to regain control of the union after stepping down as its leader four years earlier — and the mob wanted no part of that since it meant they'd lose access to the the Teamster's lucrative pension fund.

At around 2:15 p.m., Hoffa, 62,  called his wife, Josephine, from the restaurant's parking lot to tell her no one showed up. It was the last time anyone ever heard from him.  

He was officially declared dead seven years later, but the whereabouts of his remains have baffled the FBI ever since.

Over the past five decades, the agency has assigned hundreds of agents to the case who've debunked conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory – while costing taxpayers tens of millions of dollars, estimated Hoffa historian and author Scott Burnstein.

The case also spawned more than 20 books, multiple movies and documentaries – and a cottage industry of investigative journalists, amateur sleuths and former wise guys claiming to know what really happened.

Just this week a new theory emerged — that Hoffa's corpse was literally turned into mincemeat, The Post can reveal. 

Burnstein — who believes the hit on Hoffa was carried out by Detroit's Tocco–Zerilli crime family — said the case's mythology took on a life of its own because  remains were never found.

“This was something they thought was a perfect crime – and in a lot of ways it was the perfect crime,” he told The Post, referring to the crime syndicate also known as “Detroit Partnership.” “I just don't think they anticipated people would still be talking about it 50 years later, and this is a mob family that thrives in the shadows. They like being stealth.

“They're not a New York-type family or Chicago-type family or Philadelphia-type family that really covets the press.”

On Wednesday, Burnstein teamed up with former federal prosecutor Richard Convertino and ex-mob soldier Nove Tocco at an event at Macomb Community College in Warren, Mich., to reveal the latest theory to surface about what happened to Hoffa.

They claimed Hoffa was whacked by late Detroit mobster Anthony “Tony Pal” Palazzolo — and the body ground up in a sausage grinder at the former Detroit Sausage Company Palazzolo used for his operations.

The remaining pieces were then dumped in an incinerator of a mob-owned waste disposal business in nearby Hamtramck, Mich., that was destroyed in an arson fire eight months later, the trio claimed. The site is now part of a local jail complex.

Other popular theories about Hoffa's demise include: 

Dan Moldea, a 75-year-old journalist and author of “The Hoffa Wars” who has written extensively about the case since the ex-Teamster boss went missing, spurred one of the most recent searches for Hoffa in 2021 by providing the feds information he secured from multiple mob sources.

Moldea told the FBI he believed Hoffa was buried in a steel drum in an alcove under the Pulaski Skyway, near the site of a former Jersey City landfill.

Before the FBI began its search, Moldea and Fox News contracted teams of investigators to use ground-penetrating radar to check for anomalies under the site, such as steel drums. Both tests flagged possible evidence, he said.

The scans were then provided to the FBI's Detroit Field Office, but Moldea said that office never shared the information with the FBI's Newark Field Office — and he believes this led to the feds digging in the wrong spot a mere 10 yards away and coming up empty.

“We spoon-fed them this information, so it was tragic the way the whole thing worked out,” Moldea told The Post.

He wants to re-examine the suspected burial site, which is now owned by the New Jersey Department of Transportation, but said he's been blocked because the agency claims the area is currently an active work zone for overhead construction on the highway.

Burnstein said he has great respect for Moldea's work but believes the murder and body disposal was done locally — not out of state.

“I think people are making this way more complex than it actually was,” Bernstein said. “This was a job done by the Detroit mob, and it was probably done within a half hour or 45 minutes.”

Besides Hoffa's bid to reclaim the Teamsters' presidency — a title he held from 1959 to 1971 —  Burnstein said his sources told him there's another reason mobsters wanted Hoffa dead: He was a “confidential informant working for the FBI.”

“The rumors were starting to spread on the street in the spring of 75,” he said.

The FBI said the case remains active but declined to answer questions.

“As the 50th anniversary of Mr. Hoffa's disappearance approaches, the FBI Detroit Field Office remains steadfast in its commitment to pursuing all credible leads,” said Cheyvoryea Gibson, the office's Special Agent in Charge. 

“We continue to encourage anyone with information to submit a tip at tips.fbi.gov or call 1-800-CALL-FBI.”

James P. Hoffa, son of the late Teamsters boss, told the Detroit News he doesn't buy that his father's remains were taken out of state, and he denied that his father planned to testify for the feds. 

He's proud of the “legacy” his father left behind, but regrets the disappearance became comedy fodder for late-night television and that his mother died in 1980 with a “broken heart.”

“My father went to a meeting he shouldn't have gone to, and he was murdered,” said the younger Hoffa, 84, who served as Teamsters president from 1998-2022. “I know there are a lot of theories out there, but we've stopped trying to figure out who did what to whom.

“This is a tragedy our family has had to live with, and we're still hoping to have closure someday.”

False claim that Brigitte Macron was born a man has roots in pandemic-era France as distrust of politicians peaked

When the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and his wife, Brigitte, took the rare step this week of filing a US defamation lawsuit against the rightwing podcaster Candace Owens, it marked a new phase in a legal battle on both sides of the Atlantic against the false claim that Brigitte Macron is a man named Jean-Michel Trogneux.

The Macrons' US lawsuit attacked what it called the “verifiably false and devastating lies” being repeated online by Owens that Brigitte Macron, 72, was born a man. The lawsuit said evidence clearly disproved this “grotesque narrative”, which had become “a campaign of global humiliation” and “relentless bullying on a worldwide scale”.

The case prompted broader questions this week about how conspiracy theories spread worldwide, whether they can be stopped in the courts and what this false narrative, which began in France after the Covid pandemic, says about French society's distrust in politicians.

“This is now one of the biggest fake news stories worldwide in terms of popularity – a billion people have seen it,” said Emmanuelle Anizon, a senior journalist for the French weekly Nouvel Obs, who last year published a book, L'Affaire Madame, investigating the origins of the rumour in France. “What's new is that for the first time, Emmanuel Macron has joined his wife in taking legal action.”

The Macrons' US lawsuit states the accusation that Brigitte Macron was born a man named Jean-Michel Trogneux is completely false and Trogneux is in fact is her older brother. Trogneux, 80, lives in the northern French town of Amiens, where he grew up with Brigitte and four other siblings in a family famous for its local chocolate business. He was present in public alongside his Brigitte at Emmanuel Macron's two presidential inaugurations in 2017 and 2022.

Owens, whose podcast and social media channels have an audience of millions, said this week she stood by her narrative.

The false claim that Brigitte was a man first went viral in France in 2021, at a moment when distrust of politicians in was at a high, after the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) anti-government protest movement and the Covid pandemic that killed more than 130,000 people in France.

In December 2021, a woman who used the name Amandine Roy and called herself a “spiritual medium”, broadcast a four-hour YouTube interview with Natacha Rey, 51, who had worked previously for a small essential oils business and described herself as “an independent investigative journalist, self-taught, and not from the inner circle of mainstream media”.

Rey said she had spent three years investigating Brigitte Macron, after questioning the first lady's body-shape in photos. Rey said she believed Brigitte Macron was actually a man called Jean-Michel Trogneux. Within hours, the interview had 500,000 views and the hashtag #Jean-MichelTrogneux was trending on social media in France, promoted by, among others, some far-right and anti-vaccine accounts. A small far-right newsletter had already published Rey's theories but it was the video interview that sent the claim viral.

“There was a deeper societal problem at that time in France: the mistrust of political, media and economic institutions,” Anizon said. “There had been years of political health scandals worldwide and in France – from a contaminated blood scandal to the Mediator weight-loss drug. Many people had gradually reached a point of distrust, switching off traditional mainstream media and turning instead to online accounts – Covid and vaccine mistrust increased that.”

The rumour spread in part because the Macrons' relationship had long been a topic of comment online. Brigitte Macron, who is 24 years older, first met Emmanuel Macron when she was a French teacher at his Jesuit secondary school in Amiens, directing him in a school play.

The Macrons' US lawsuit this week stated: “Through the school's theatre programme, president Macron and Mrs Macron formed a deeper intellectual connection.” It added: “At all times the teacher-student relationship between Mrs Macron and President Macron remained within the bounds of the law.” Brigitte Macron, who has three children from her first marriage, divorced in 2006 and she and Emmanuel Macron married the following year when he was 30.

In early 2022, after the first viral video allegations, Brigitte Macron and her brother, Jean-Michel Trogneux, filed a defamation case in France against Roy and Rey, who both denied wrongdoing.

In September 2024, a Paris court found the two women guilty and ordered them to pay €8,000 in damages to Brigitte Macron and €5,000 in damages to Jean-Michel Trogneux.

The women appealed against the verdict and, this month, they were acquitted by a Paris appeals court. The appeal court verdict did not imply that the claims that Brigitte Macron was a man were true, but instead judges ruled that the case against the women did not fit the definition of defamation.

Brigitte Macron and Jean-Michel Trogneux have taken the case to France's highest appeals court, the cour de cassation. Brigitte Macron has filed a separate case for online harassment and 10 people will go on trial in Paris in October.

Each time the Macrons' relationship is in the spotlight, the false allegations about gender spread again online. This was the case in May, when video images appeared to show Brigitte pushing her husband away with both hands on his face before they disembarked from a plane on a tour of Southeast Asia. Macron dismissed the incident as play-fighting, telling reporters that “we are squabbling and, rather, joking with my wife”, and that it had been overblown into “a sort of geo-planetary catastrophe”.

Brigitte Macron has not spoken publicly on the false gender claims since 2022 when she told French radio, RTL, that allegations that “I am my brother” were an “impossible” attack on her parents' family tree. She told TF1 TV at the time she wanted to set an example so other people would not suffer in the same way. She said fighting online bullying “is my battle”.

	“The Boys” couldn't let “Gen V” have all the fun at San Diego Comic Con.


	At the very end of the “Gen V” Season 2 panel on Friday afternoon, the upcoming fifth and final season of “The Boys” showed its very first teaser to the crowd of attendees in Ballroom 20. It was a brief teaser, packed with tons of superhero violence and gore — as fans of “The Boys” have come to expect — and quick looks at the new and returning cast members.

	The action unfolded quickly, but a couple of the highlights included a new supe character vomiting up what appeared to be a bloody hairball onto another character and someone having what could only be described as a violent explosion in a bathroom stall.

	Seth Rogen, who's an executive producer on “The Boys” and has appeared in a handful of cameos across the previous seasons, also made an appearance in the teaser. As did newcomers Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins, who are both playing unknown characters. Both actors appeared in a blink-or-you-miss-it scene together, in what's the latest “Supernatural” reunion on “The Boys.” Showrunner Eric Kripke was also the creator of the beloved CW series and had already cast “Supernatural” stars Jensen Ackles, as the Captain America-like antihero Soldier Boy, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, as Joe Kessler, on “The Boys.” “Supernatural” fans had been begging Kripke to bring more of their faves to the Prime Video superhero show, and now their wishes have been granted.


	The most memorable part of the teaser was a powerful declaration by Antony Starr's Homelander, in which he bellows how “this is a safer, more god-fearing nation” to an unseen crowd. At the end of Season 4, Homelander essentially worked his way into the White House and is the real power behind the new U.S. president. The country is under martial law, and Homelander has rounded up the Boys and other supes who don't want to “make America super again.”

	











	In the quick teaser, at least one “Gen V” cast member was spotted: London Thor as Godolkin University student Jordan Li. That makes sense, as “Gen V” stars Maddie Phillips and Asa Germann appeared in “The Boys” Season 4 finale as pro-Homelander enforcers who turned on their fellow classmates and former friends. The “Gen V” and “The Boys” cross-show synergy continues with Erin Moriarty and Chace Crawford appearing in “Gen V” Season 2, coming this fall.


	Many of “The Boys” alum are returning for the final season, in addition to the aforementioned actors: Jack Quaid, Karl Urban, Jessie T. Usher, Tomer Capone, Karen Fukuhara, Laz Alonso, Nathan Mitchell, Colby Minifie, Cameron Crovetti, Susan Heyward, Valorie Curry and more. New faces coming in Season 5 include Daveed Diggs and Paul Reiser. Season 5 will release some time in 2026.
