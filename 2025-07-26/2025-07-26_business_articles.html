                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The AI talent wars took another turn on Friday when Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Shengjia Zhao, co-creator of ChatGPT and the former lead scientist at OpenAI, is now the chief scientist at Meta's Superintelligence Labs. "In this role, Shengjia will set the research agenda and scientific direction for our new lab working directly with me and Alex," a statement shared to Zuckerberg's Threads account said. "Shengjia co-founded the new lab and has been our lead scientist from day one." The statement said Meta chose to formalize Zhao's leadership position because recruiting is "going well" and the team "is coming together." While the announcement elicited congratulatory remarks from some AI enthusiasts online, and more discussion about Meta's ongoing poaching spree, others asked: What about Yann LeCun? On LinkedIn, LeCun acknowledged the questions and clarified his role at Meta. "My role as Chief Scientist for FAIR has always been focused on long-term AI research and building the next AI paradigms," LeCun wrote on Friday. Zuckerberg and Alexandr Wang, the Scale AI founder who joined Meta in June as its chief AI officer, confirmed that LeCun's role is unchanged on their respective social media accounts. Although both FAIR and the Superintelligence Labs deal with AI, they're slightly different. Meta created FAIR over a decade ago to research and advance AI technology, which resulted in the 2023 release of its open-source large language model, Llama. LeCun is now largely focused on developing a new kind of model, known as a world model, that could one day replace large language models. The Superintelligence Labs, meanwhile, is the umbrella department housing Meta's FAIR, foundations, and products teams, Zuckerberg said in an internal memo in June. Wang praised Zhao in an X post on Friday. "Shengjia is a brilliant scientist who most recently pioneered a new scaling paradigm in his research," Wang said in an X post on Friday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two-thirds of Americans drink coffee every single day, according to data collected by the National Coffee Association in 2022, and the debate about how much is too much and whether or not any amount of caffeine is safe persists. But recent research shows that the answer is more complicated than you'd think. A Harvard study, that followed nearly 50,000 women over the course of 30 years and published in June, found that drinking coffee every day may lead to healthy aging in women. But research also shows that high coffee consumption can increase your likelihood of dementia. And a 2022 paper published in the Journal of the American Heart Association found a link between heavy coffee consumption and an increased risk of dying from cardiovascular disease in people with hypertension. And health experts consistently advise that, like with most things, moderation is key for your daily coffee. Deepak Chopra, author, speaker and proponent of alternative medicine, told CNBC Make It in 2023 that he drinks two to three cups of coffee each day before noon. While that may sound like too much caffeine for the average person, it's actually within a healthy range. "Drinking two to three cups before noon is safe to do," registered dietitian Roxana Ehsani said in an interview with CNBC Make It last year. Ehsani's suggestion follows the Food and Drug Administration's recommendation of consuming no more than 400 milligrams of caffeine a day, which can include the caffeine found in teas, energy drinks, sodas and chocolate. Certain people may benefit from consuming much less caffeine than is recommended by the FDA. "Within those milligram or cup of coffee recommendations, if you start feeling overly tired and the caffeine is not helping, then you've got to stop [drinking it]," dietitian Jessica Sylvester told NBC News. "If your heart starts beating incredibly fast, you've got to stop. And people who have diabetes or cardiovascular disease should be mindful of their sugar intake when having coffee, Nikki Cota, a dietitian at the Mayo Clinic, told NBC News. Expert opinion also varies on if teens should drink coffee, but "avoiding caffeine is the best choice for all kids," according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Ehsani recommends drinking water or having a meal before reaching for coffee since caffeine suppresses appetite. And if you notice your sleep is affected when you have a coffee in the afternoon, experts suggest a mornings-only rule for your daily latte or macchiato.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And while AI might not be eliminating a large percentage of early career jobs, as recent headlines have proclaimed, it certainly is changing them in a big way. "AI is reshaping entry-level roles by automating routine, manual tasks," said Fawad Bajwa, global AI, data, and analytics practice leader at executive search and leadership advisory firm Russell Reynolds Associates. "Instead of drafting emails, cleaning basic data, or coordinating meeting schedules, early-career professionals have begun curating AI-enabled outputs and applying judgment." For example, people working in entry-level marketing jobs are using generative AI to create first drafts of promotional or campaign documents, and early career data analysts are relying on AI to prepare datasets, Bajwa said. "AI is reshaping all jobs," said Zanele Munyikwa, an economist at labor analytics firm Revelio Labs. He pointed out that hiring for entry-level jobs is down in general, regardless of AI exposure. For example, the firm's research has shown that tasks performed by junior-level professionals are shifting toward less AI-exposed functions. "While AI may currently have some productivity boosting capabilities, it needs to be applied and used consistently across large parts of the organization to take effect." "This will take a lot of time and careful leadership to even partially achieve big cost savings," he said. Jobs with low AI exposure frequently involve tasks that are difficult to automate, the Revelio Labs' research noted. These positions include manual jobs in manufacturing, hospitality roles, or interpersonal work, which still require a steady pipeline of human workers. To be sure, AI is already eliminating some entry-level functions in companies. Although it is highly unlikely that there would be a significant impact on entry-level jobs in the short term, Bajwa said, "organizations must redesign how early talent is onboarded, developed, and integrated in order to navigate the decade ahead," he said. "Without foundational tasks, it's harder for people to build experience, leading to a fundamental gap in terms of how new professionals will build judgment, confidence and fluency." In fact, 54% of the 3,000 executives from Russell Reynolds' global network that the company surveyed are concerned that AI reliance is eroding critical thinking, and one-quarter are worried about AI inadvertently undermining product/service quality and critical internal process quality. A growing number of leaders across industries are also concerned about AI-driven layoffs, according to the RRA research. Last year 20% said they were concerned, compared with 40%in the latest survey. CIOs and other technology leaders need to be prepared for the impact of AI on current and future entry-level jobs within their departments, especially considering how aggressively many are launching AI initiatives. "It changes both talent strategy and team design," Bajwa said. "Tech leaders must now rethink how they develop junior talent and build future pipelines. The goal isn't just efficiency; it's ensuring AI-augmented teams can still grow, learn and lead," he said. With the possible reduction in some entry-level technology positions, there is a potential for more top-heavy team structures, Muniykwa said. "Tech leaders need to redesign workflows and roles as they implement AI," he said. Businesses will need new "on-ramps", for example, apprenticeships and AI-assisted boot camps, so early-career talent can still learn and advance even as some traditional entry-level tasks disappear, Munyikwa said. "Leaders must plan for continuous upskilling, not one-off training sessions, to keep teams productive alongside rapidly evolving AI tools," he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rehearsing a big presentation or jotting down some notes before a one-on-one meeting with your boss is normal. You should use a similar, truncated practice before casual interactions, recommends conversation expert Alison Wood Brooks: Take 30 seconds before greeting the other person to think about topics to go over, questions you want to ask or your goals for the conversation. Putting forethought into your casual chats can make you look smart, prepared and considerate — like a good friend who remembers even minute details of past conversations — says Wood Brooks, a Harvard University associate professor who teaches an MBA course called "How to talk gooder in business and life." "Even if you're calling a friend you know well or your mom, what we find in our research is that even 30 seconds of forethought will make that conversation go better," she says. After the conversation starts, you'll have less brainpower to come up with talking prompts or conversational segues, she adds. "Once the conversation is underway, your brain becomes very busy ... listening to the other person's words, trying to read their emotional expressions, preparing what you're going to say next," says Wood Brooks. Sharp communication skills can help build relationships and propel your career, but being a good conversationalist often takes continual practice, Wood Brooks says. For example, you can always practice focusing more on the other person than yourself, speaking expert and author John Bowe wrote for CNBC Make It on September 25. "You've asked this person for their attention; now give them yours," wrote Bowe. One particularly powerful phrase, according to conversation expert and Stanford University lecturer Matt Abrahams: "Tell me more." The opposite is a 'shift' response," which is a statement that shifts the conversation back to you," Abrahams wrote in October 2023, adding: "So many people make the mistake of treating other people's stories as openings for them to talk about themselves.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the past, CEO Elon Musk's futuristic promises have convinced investors to look past top and bottom line numbers. Following another fairly dismal earnings report this week, Musk told analysts on the call that Tesla's electric vehicles will soon become driverless, making money for owners while they sleep. He also said Tesla's robotaxi service, which the company recently started testing in a limited capacity in Austin, Texas, will expand to other states, with a goal of being able to reach half the U.S. population by year-end, "assuming we have regulatory approvals." Automotive sales declined 16% year-over-year in the second quarter for the EV maker, with weak sales numbers continuing in Europe and California. Musk said there could be a "few rough quarters" ahead because of the EV credits expiring and President Donald Trump's tariffs. And robots," wrote analysts at Canaccord Genuity, who recommend buying Tesla's stock, in a note after the earnings report. "Over time, Tesla is well positioned to benefit from these future-forward opportunities." We need the P&L dynamics to turn." Analysts at Jefferies described the earnings update as "a bit dull." And Goldman Sachs said Tesla's robotaxi effort is "still small" with limited technical data points. Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment. Musk, who has previously called himself "pathologically optimistic," has been able to sway shareholders and send the stock soaring at times with promises of self-driving cars, humanoid robots and more affordable EVs. But after a decade of missed self-imposed deadlines on autonomous driving, Wall Street is watching Tesla fall behind Alphabet's Waymo in the U.S. and Baidu's Apollo Go in China. Business Insider reported on Friday that Tesla told staff its robotaxi service could launch in the San Francisco Bay Area as soon as this weekend. But Tesla hasn't applied for permits that would be required to run a driverless ridehailing service in California, CNBC confirmed. The CPUC told CNBC on Friday, that under existing permits, Tesla can only operate a human-driven chartered vehicle service, not carry passengers in robotaxis. On the earnings call, Musk and other Tesla execs claimed the company was working on regulatory approvals to launch in Nevada, Arizona, Florida and other markets, in addition to San Francisco, but offered no details about what would be required. Within Austin, the company said its robotaxi service had driven 7,000 miles, and that Tesla has been restricting its robotaxis' to roads with a speed limit of 40 miles per hour. The Austin service involves a small fleet of about 10 to 20 Model Y vehicles equipped with the company's latest self-driving systems. The Tesla robotaxis rely on remote supervision by employees in a customer service center, and a human safety supervisor in the front passenger seat, ready to intervene if needed. Compare that to what Alphabet said on its second-quarter earnings call the same day as Tesla's results. "The Waymo Driver has now autonomously driven over 100 million miles on public roads, and the team is testing across more than 10 cities this year, including New York and Philadelphia," Alphabet said. Meanwhile, Waymo has become significant enough that Alphabet added a category to its Other Bets revenue description in its latest quarterly filing. Regardless of investor skepticism, Musk is more bullish than ever. On Friday, the world's richest person posted on his social network X that he thinks Tesla will someday be worth $20 trillion. On the earnings call earlier in the week, he said that when it comes to AI for cars and robots, "Tesla is actually much better than Google by far" and "much better than anyone at real world AI." CORRECTION: The Waymo Driver has now autonomously driven over 100 million miles on public roads, according to Alphabet. A previous version misstated the number of miles.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff powers and recent trade deals could soon run into a legal buzzsaw. A federal appeals court is set to hear oral arguments next week in a high-profile lawsuit challenging Trump's stated authority to effectively slap tariffs at any level on any country at any time, so long as he deems them necessary to address a national emergency. The Trump administration says that that expansive tariff power derives from the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. The bulk of Trump's biggest tariffs — including his fentanyl-related duties on Canada, Mexico and China, and the worldwide "reciprocal" tariffs he first unveiled in early April — rest on his invocation of that law. The U.S. Court of International Trade struck those tariffs down in late May, ruling that Trump exceeded his authority under IEEPA. Selections v. Trump, is the furthest along of more than half a dozen federal lawsuits challenging Trump's use of the emergency-powers law. It's set for oral argument before the Federal Circuit on Thursday morning. "I think the tariffs are at risk," said Ted Murphy, partner and head of global trade practice at law firm Sidley Austin, in an interview with CNBC. IEEPA gives Trump some powers to deal with national emergencies stemming from "any unusual and extraordinary threat" that comes in whole or in large part from outside the U.S. But attorneys representing the handful of small businesses that sued Trump argue that the law does not let him unilaterally impose tariffs. "IEEPA nowhere mentions tariffs, duties, imposts, or taxes, and no other President in the statute's nearly 50-year history has claimed that it authorizes tariffs," they wrote in a court brief this month. Attorneys for Trump and his administration, however, argue that Congress has long empowered presidents to impose tariffs to address key national concerns. But some experts still expect that Trump's IEEPA tariffs will be scrapped. "Trump will probably continue to lose in the lower courts, and we believe the Supreme Court is highly unlikely to rule in his favor," U.S. policy analysts from Piper Sandler wrote in a research note Friday morning. The analysts wrote that such a loss would effectively mean the collapse of almost every trade development that Trump has held up as an accomplishment during his first six months in office. "So are his letters informing countries of their new tariffs, the current 10% minimum, and the reciprocal tariffs he has proposed or threatened," they added. For instance, Trump has recently announced only the broad outlines of trade agreements with Japan, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines — and those deals have yet to be finalized. However, Trump in mid-June signed an executive order specifying that he is invoking the emergency-powers law as part of a U.S. trade agreement with the United Kingdom. Trump this month has also sent 25 letters to individual world leaders, dictating the new tariff rates that their countries' U.S. exports will face starting Aug. 1. Trump has said that his letters are tantamount to bilateral trade deals. But their language echoes the same arguments about unfair trade, deficits and national security that Trump invoked during his reciprocal tariff rollout. The White House ignored CNBC's request to confirm that Trump's leader-to-leader letters, and the tariff rates set in his recent spate of trade deals, hinge on IEEPA authority. It has, however, confirmed that the massive 50% tariff Trump set on imports from Brazil did, in fact, rely on IEEPA powers. Strangely, that letter focused less on trade and more on Trump's gripes about Brazil's treatment of its former president, Jair Bolsonaro, who is facing trial over his role in an alleged coup to overturn his 2022 reelection loss. One day after the federal trade court issued its May decision in V.O.S., U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras delivered an even broader ruling against the Trump administration in a separate case in Washington, D.C., federal court. specifically found that some of the tariffs Trump had imposed were unauthorized by IEEPA. But Contreras, in the case known as Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump, ruled that the law itself does not allow a president to take any unilateral tariff actions. Circuit, which paused a preliminary injunction that Contreras had issued. Oral arguments in the case are set for Sept. 30.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration has taken direct stakes in companies on a scale rarely seen in the U.S. outside wartime or economic crisis, pushing a Republican Party that traditionally championed free-market capitalism to embrace state intervention in industries viewed as important for national security. Japan's Nippon Steel agreed to give President Donald Trump a "golden share" in U.S. Steel as a condition for the two companies' controversial merger. Trump now personally wields sweeping veto power over major business decisions made by the nation's third-largest steel producer. "You know who has the golden share? The president's golden share in U.S. Steel is similar to nationalizing a company but without any of the benefits that a company normally receives, such as direct investment by the government, said Sarah Bauerle Danzman, an expert on foreign investment and national security at the Atlantic Council, a think tank focused on international affairs. But the Trump administration demonstrated earlier this month that it is also willing to buy directly into publicly traded corporations. This level of support by the federal government for a mining company is unprecedented, said Gracelin Baskaran, an expert on critical minerals at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Trump's unique hold over the Republican Party gives him the ability to intervene in companies on a scale that would be difficult politically for a Democratic president, Danzman said. "The Democrat would have been accused of being a communist and a lot of other Republicans probably would not have felt comfortable moving in this particular direction because of their greater commitment to market principles," Danzman said. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. More interventions could be on the horizon as the Trump administration develops a policy to support U.S. companies in strategic industries against state-backed competition from China. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in April that the U.S. government might need to make an "equity investment in each of these companies that's taking on China in critical minerals." The Pentagon's investment in MP Materials is a model for future public-private partnerships, CEO James Litinsky said. "It's a new way forward to accelerate free markets, to get the supply chain on shore that we want," Litinsky told CNBC. Meanwhile, the golden share in U.S. Steel is a potential model for foreign direct investment "transactions that really affect our national security but where it's going to be great for our economic growth," Sen. Dave McCormick, R-Pa., said in a May interview with CNBC. "Having taken a stake in US Steel and MP, we're now left to wonder where this administration will find its next investment," Don Bilson, an analyst at Gordon Haskett, wrote in a note to clients earlier this month. Trump proposed in January that the U.S. should take a 50% stake in social media app TikTok as part of a joint venture. China's ByteDance is required under a recently passed law to divest TikTok or the platform will be banned in the U.S. Trump extended ByteDance's compliance deadline until Sept. 17. The U.S. has a long history of intervening in industries, particularly where national defense is concerned, said Mark Wilson, a historian at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, who studies the military-industrial complex. But past interventions were often temporary and typically happened during war, economic crisis or took the form of bailouts to prevent a major player in a critical industry from going bankrupt. In the 1970s, defense giant Lockheed and automaker Chrysler received government bailouts. During World War I, President Woodrow Wilson nationalized the railroads, but he returned them to private ownership after the conflict. The U.S. is not fighting an economic crisis or war today, but the return of great power competition with Russia and China and the supply chain disruptions of the Covid-19 pandemic have led to more nationalistic economic policies, said UNC's Wilson. The U.S. has increasingly recognized that China's economic model is based on manufacturing overcapacity that dumps products "onto global markets in ways that make it hard for other markets to compete," Danzman said. Within weeks, automakers warned they would have to halt production due to a rare-earth shortage, forcing the U.S. back to the negotiating table with Beijing, she said. "The historical moment we're in does seem to be one where there is this reassessment of assumptions of the previous generation about the efficacy of markets and free trade to solve all our problems in national security," Wilson said. "When you step in to try to address one of these market failures with this kind of government intervention, you can have a cascade of new market failures," she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ABOARD A NATO AWACS PLANE — As the aircraft soared over Eastern Europe, tiny triangles and U-shapes blinked across a glowing console. The NATO E-3A Sentry, a flying radar and airborne command post, was tracking them all, with its rotating radar dome scanning hundreds of miles in every direction. Business Insider was given access to a NATO AWACS flight this week for an eight-hour surveillance mission above Eastern Europe. Departing from Geilenkirchen Air Base in western Germany — home to 14 aging E-3s — at 8 am, the plane flew east to support Baltic Sentry operations, an ongoing alliance effort focused on protecting undersea infrastructure after recent sabotage incidents in the Baltic Sea. The airborne warning and control system, or AWACS, is a modified Boeing 707/320 passenger plane with a long-range radar and advanced sensors that can detect friendly or hostile objects from far away and collect data that can be distributed in real time to allied ground stations, ships, or other aircraft. It can see over 300 miles across the air and surface, giving commanders critical situational awareness at war or in peacetime. As an older plane, the interior feels more like a Cold War time capsule than a 21st-century warplane, but this aircraft is actually a surveillance nerve center loaded with advanced and highly classified equipment, keeping tabs on things. The surveillance mission is "the bread and butter of this platform," said Maj. Ben, who, like others BI spoke with during the flight, could only be identified by his rank and first name for security reasons. The E-3 is capable of a range of missions, including surveillance, tracking, target detection, early warning, command and control, and battle management, making it a high-value military asset and one of the few that NATO itself actually owns. Despite their age, these planes have proven indispensable since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. After the full-scale assault in 2022, the AWACS fleet intensified its patrols to monitor Russian activity and deter aggression on NATO's eastern flank. The AWACS functions like a high-flying office space, with a range of different roles and stations where crew members work at their computers or with other sensitive instruments. Looking at it in 2025, the interior is dated and almost feels like stepping into a museum. This flying command station is anything but an artifact. And just about everything the crew touches, from paperwork to computer screens, is classified and had to be sanitized before BI could take photos. The plane's big radar rotates once every 10 seconds and can detect everything from warships to aircraft to air defense systems. "Wherever the demand is for an air picture, we can go there," explained Cpt. Jasper, a Dutch surveillance controller who monitors the airspace and surface. "That's something that static sites cannot do, and what most ground sites cannot do," he said, adding that this is the advantage of "having a big flying radar and air control station." One screen BI was authorized to review showed activity in and above Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, the Baltic Sea, and Kaliningrad. The small but heavily militarized Russian province, sandwiched between two NATO countries, has long been a concern for the alliance. That is why the AWACS are watching, and they see everything. If a Russian fighter jet took off from an airbase in Kaliningrad, the AWACS — circling just beyond its airspace — would surely spot it. The exclave hosts some of Moscow's ships, ground forces, and air defenses. Beyond its robust surveillance capabilities, the E-3 is also a command and control platform that can coordinate with other aircraft and easily be retasked. That flexibility is a critical capability for high-end fights, where numerous assets would be on the move in a fast-paced operating environment. "For the time we are now in, it's better to have a flexible force. The aircraft can normally operate for eight and a half hours, although it can fly longer missions through its air-to-air refueling capability. At one point during the flight, the vintage seatbelt sign clicked on, signaling that this process was about to begin. Aerial refueling is a delicate process that requires the AWACS pilots to drop altitude and fly the aircraft by hand so it can connect to the tanker and receive fuel. This made for a bumpy stretch that much of the crew elected to sleep through. Donny Demmers, a public affairs officer who was permitted to share his full name, said NATO can send an AWACS to operate from an area far from base, and thanks to the mid-air refueling, the plane can remain on station for a long time. The E-3 flew back to Geilenkirchen and touched down shortly before 4 pm, but that flight time could have been greatly extended if needed during a crisis.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many engaged couples in the U.S. are relying on forms of credit to pay for their wedding. Experts say that approach can be smart, if done carefully. While 46% of surveyed newlyweds — couples who tied the knot within the past two years — used mostly savings to pay for costs, 24% paid with credit cards, according to a report by LendingTree. A separate report by Zola, based on a survey of 6,000 couples getting married in 2025, found that 31% of engaged couples polled plan to use credit cards to pay for their wedding, including using points or applying for new cards. More from Personal Finance:‘Trump accounts' come with a $1,000 baby bonus. The rules get complicatedStudent loan borrowers may have 'no affordable options' under TrumpTrump's 'no tax on tips' sparks questions for workers Otherwise, a credit card can be a slippery slope, leading couples to walk down the aisle with long-lasting and expensive debt, experts say. About 67% of surveyed newlyweds took on debt for their wedding, according to LendingTree. If you have savings set aside to cover your wedding costs, charging the expense to a credit card and then immediately using those savings to pay off the bill can help you earn rewards such as points or miles, said Schulz. Some credit cards offer big sign-up bonuses when you spend a set amount on the card within a short period of opening it. That might be more than you spend on normal expenses, but within reach if you have big expenses — such as wedding-related purchases and deposits — coming up. By immediately paying that charge off with your savings, you can take advantage of the rewards for things such as your honeymoon, Schulz said. "It's a way to make those savings work even harder for you," he said. Using a credit card can have other advantages, too. Credit cards offer layers of federal protection that can help cardholders dispute charges and get a refund if things go awry with an item or service purchased with a card, experts say. Some cards also offer purchase protections, a form of insurance against theft or damages, per NerdWallet. However, the key with credit cards "is to pay in full," said Ted Rossman, a senior industry analyst at Bankrate. "I definitely would not recommend putting wedding expenses on a card if you're going to be dragging that out over time," he said. Nearly a quarter, or 24%, of newlyweds married within two years of the survey are still paying the debt off, according to LendingTree. Of those that still owe money, 47% said they will finish paying the debt in six months to a year. "You don't want to sacrifice your long-term well-being for a short-term event," Rossman said. Otherwise, whatever balance is left will then get interest tacked on. As you begin to plan the wedding and reach out to vendors, ask if they accept credit cards as a form of payment, said Jason Rhee, a wedding planner in Los Angeles. Assess whether paying the extra cost is both affordable and worth it to you, or if it's best to use a different form of payment with the vendor, said Lauren Kay, executive editor of The Knot. What's more, some vendors may offer discounts for payments in cash. While credit cards can offer certain protections to incurred payments or purchases, they might not offer broader protections or policies to cover larger expenditures, such as the reception or the venue, Kay said. "In most instances, your credit card wouldn't offer any real benefit if something were to go wrong with a purchase of that magnitude," said Kay. For such expenses, wedding insurance policies can be a good option to consider. They help protect you from unexpected risks such as extreme weather, theft or a vendor who didn't show up, said Kay. Wedding insurance policy pricing can range from less than $100 to more than $1,000, according to NerdWallet, depending on the size of your policy and the kinds of coverage.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are two schools of thought around CBS' decision to end "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert." While NBC recently extended the contracts of its two late night hosts, Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers, into 2028, Kimmel's contract is set to lapse in 2026. "Jimmy Kimmel Live" has been a late night staple since 2003, acting not only as a typical talk show on the circuit, but as a valuable marketing hub for Disney's slate of theatrical and television content. In addition to traditional one-on-one interviews, Kimmel will also frequently host several stars from the same project, often for blockbuster titles from Marvel, Star Wars and the company's animated franchises. Clips from these chats are fed onto Kimmel's YouTube channel, which has more than 20 million subscribers, and across social media, helping to generate buzz for upcoming Disney projects. Kimmel is also a frequent host of the Academy Awards, which airs on Disney's ABC, and is currently the host of ABC's celebrity edition of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire." These ancillary assignments, as well as his annual job closing out Disney's Upfronts presentation for advertisers, may make Kimmel more important to Disney's long-term future than Colbert was for Paramount or CBS. The cost of producing late night programs has risen as the media industry has been upended by streaming and shifting consumer habits. The traditional pay TV bundle has lost millions of customers in recent years, and as they've disappeared, so too have advertising dollars. The shifting equation has forced media companies to rebalance. At a large scale, companies like Comcast's NBCUniversal and Warner Bros. Discovery have opted to split off their cable TV networks into separate corporate entities. At the programming level, big shows are increasingly greenlit for release on streaming services rather than traditional networks. Salaries of highly paid news anchors have moderated, with some stepping away from traditional networks entirely and starting out their own ventures. And much of the money spent on bulking up both linear TV networks and streaming services is earmarked for live sports. "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" employed around 200 people and recorded annual losses of around $40 million, according to a person familiar with the matter, who declined to be named speaking about nonpublic matters. "Jimmy Kimmel Live" employs around 250 people and loses roughly the same amount, according to a person familiar with that show's finances. Linear TV advertising revenue has also been on a steady downward slope. Industry analysts and experts expected the ad market to stabilize in 2025 after tumultuous streaming-centric years, but macroeconomic uncertainty has hampered the recovery. In quarterly earnings that were reported in May, Paramount, NBCUniversal and Disney each reported lower ad sales on a year-over-year basis. That championship beckons the most ad dollars of any live event on TV. Overall revenue for Paramount's TV segment was down 13%. NBCUniversal recently touted its record ad sales volume during the most recent Upfront cycle due to an upcoming slate of NBA, the Super Bowl, Winter Olympics and other sports. Disney reported in May that quarterly revenue for its domestic linear networks was down 3% to $2.2 billion, attributing the decline to lower ad revenue. The announcement that Colbert's show would take its final bow in May 2026 came just days after the tenured host publicly called out Paramount for its $16 million settlement with President Donald Trump over the editing of a "60 Minutes" interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Paramount and CBS executives released a statement last week saying the cancellation was "purely a financial decision against the challenging backdrop in late night." "It is not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount," the company continued. Still, Colbert's ratings have been declining each season. Kimmel's viewership paints a similar picture, with viewership dropping from the September-to-May time period in 2019-2020 to the most recent in 2024-2025, when the average was nearly 1.6 million viewers, according to Nielsen. When Paramount listed its slate of highly rated TV shows during its last earnings report, including "Tracker," the top rated series and "Matlock," the highest rated new series, it also listed Colbert's "The Late Show" as the highest rated broadcast late night show. Some industry experts have questioned whether CBS could have explored other ways to save money — or save late night — besides outright canceling "The Late Show." NBC cut costs by eliminating the band on Meyers' late night show and shifting Fallon to four nights a week instead of five. CBS tried to bring a younger demographic into the hour with "After Midnight," a late night show that ran after Colbert. Though CBS intended to renew the show after its first two seasons, Tomlinson decided not to extend her contract, and the show was canceled.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China on Saturday released a global action plan for artificial intelligence, calling for international cooperation on tech development and regulation. The news came as the annual state-organized World Artificial Intelligence Conference kicked off in Shanghai with an opening speech by Premier Li Qiang, who announced that the Chinese government has proposed the establishment of a global AI cooperation organization, according to an official readout. Days earlier, U.S. President Donald Trump announced an American action plan for AI that included calls to reduce alleged "woke" bias in AI models and support the deployment of U.S. tech overseas. He noted how China may attract participants from its Belt and Road Initiative, while the U.S. will likely have the support of its allies, such as Japan and Australia. In his speech, Premier Li emphasized China's "AI plus" plan for integrating the tech across industries and said the country was willing to help other nations with the technology, especially in the Global South. The category loosely refers to less developed economies, especially countries outside the U.S. and European orbits. Since 2022, the U.S. has sought to restrict China's access to advanced semiconductors for training AI models. Earlier this month, U.S. chipmaker Nvidia said the U.S. was allowing it to resume shipments of a less advanced H20 chip to China after a roughly three-month pause. However, China has been developing homegrown alternatives, which Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang both praised and described as "formidable" this month during his third trip to China this year. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt met with Shanghai Party Secretary Chen Jining on Thursday in the city ahead of the AI conference, according to a city announcement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Zhao's appointment on Friday in a social media post, and called him a "pioneer" in the field who has already driven several major AI breakthroughs. Zhao previously helped build GPT-4 and led synthetic data efforts at OpenAI. According to the post, Zhao will now work directly with Zuckerberg and Meta's newly appointed chief AI officer, Alexandr Wang, the founder and CEO of Scale AI. The new hire comes during Zuckerberg's multibillion-dollar AI spending spree, including a $15 billion investment in Scale AI and the creation of Meta Superintelligence Labs, a new division focused on foundational models and next-gen research. In addition to Zhao, the company has lured away the three researchers who built OpenAI's Zurich office — Lucas Beyer, Alexander Kolesnikov, and Xiaohua Zhai — all of whom previously also worked at Google's DeepMind. But the war for AI talent is far from over. Databricks VP Naveen Rao likened the competition to "looking for LeBron James," estimating that fewer than 1,000 people worldwide can build frontier AI models. Companies without the cash for massive pay packages are turning to hackathons and computing power as incentives. AI tech workers have previously told Business Insider that Meta's Mark Zuckerberg has been emailing prospects directly and even hosting AI researchers at his home, while OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has made personal calls to potential hires. Tech company executives have mixed feelings about Meta's poaching efforts. During a July 18 episode of the podcast "Uncapped with Jack Altman," OpenAI CEO Sam Altman criticised some of Meta's "giant offers" to his company's employees, and called the strategy "crazy." "I don't think that's going to set up a great culture." Meta and OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comments.</p>
