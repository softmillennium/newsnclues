Despite growing momentum, world governments failed to agree to a moratorium on deep-sea mining as the 30th session of the International Seabed Authority wrapped up on Friday. Governments rebuked the U.S. and TMC for their unilateral approach and did not agree on a mining code that would allow the controversial practice to move forward under international law. However, campaigners said more decisive action is needed to protect the ocean and its biodiversity. Governments must respond by establishing a moratorium and reaffirming that authority over the international seabed lies collectively with all states — for the benefit of humanity as a whole.” TMC, however, could suffer consequences for bypassing the international process, as other countries and companies may decide not to do business with it. At the most recent session, the ISA's council decided not to revoke exploratory permits it had previously granted to TMC and its subsidiaries. However, it approved an investigation on Monday into whether mining contractors such as TMC subsidiaries Nauru Ocean Resources Inc. and Tonga Offshore Mining Limited were abiding by their obligations under international law. “TMC has been testing the limits of what it can get away with, a bit like a child seeing how far it can go with bad behavior,” Matthew Gianni, cofounder of the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition (DSCC), told The New York Times. Casson agreed: “The international community's message to The Metals Company is clear: Violating international law, ignoring scientific consensus, and disregarding human rights will have consequences. At the same time, a U.S. representative spoke on Thursday, doubling down on Trump's dismissal of the international process and earning instant push back from Brazil, France, and China The statement came days after Greenpeace released a report titled Deep Deception: How the Deep-Sea Mining Industry is Manipulating Geopolitics to Profit from Ocean Destruction, which details how TMC and other deep-sea mining companies are exploiting national security concerns to lobby U.S. lawmakers to fast track deep-sea mining. “The U.S. statement confirms what Deep Deception has already exposed: The Trump administration's pursuit of deep-sea mining isn't about global stewardship — it's about sidestepping it,” Arlo Hemphill, Greenpeace USA's project lead for the Stop Deep-Sea Mining campaign, said in a statement. “By rejecting the ISA's authority while claiming environmental responsibility, the U.S. is trying to have it both ways — and in doing so is advancing a ‘smash and grab' agenda that puts ocean health and international cooperation at serious risk.” “The ISA is paralyzed by a small group clinging to outdated extraction agendas while blocking even the most basic reforms,” Simon Holmström, the deep-sea mining policy officer for Seas at Risk, said in a statement. Several nations spoke strongly in favor a moratorium, including Palau, Panama, and France. “Exploiting the seabed is not a necessity — it is a choice,” said His Excellency Surangel S. Whipps Jr., president of the Republic of Palau, on Tuesday. It is gambling with the future of Pacific Island children, who will inherit the dire consequences of decisions made far from their shores.” A Pacific leader from Solomon Island also defended the interests of the Pacific Ocean community: “As Pacific people, we continue to carry the trauma of what extractive industries have already done to our homes. Olivier Poivre d'Arvor of France called for a pause of 10-15 years: “Our message is clear: no deep-sea mining without science, without collective legitimacy, without equity […] France is calling for a moratorium or a precautionary pause. “Thirty-eight states have now joined the call for a moratorium or precautionary pause, with Croatia joining the coalition during this Assembly,” said DSCC campaign director Sofia Tsenikli. “But too many other states, which were bold in their ocean promises at UNOC, are not putting this into action at the ISA. Yet our shared heritage faces an onslaught of threats from climate and nature collapse, escalating tensions, and failed leadership,” Obaidullah said. “To even consider a new form of ecocide on our already ailing planet is both reckless and irrational. We know that deep-sea mining will devastate life in the deep ocean, wipe out species before they have been discovered, and impact ocean functions, including carbon sequestration. We cannot colonize and conquer our shared heritage which belongs to us all. DSCC's Gianni also argued strongly for a pause: “Being on the fence or remaining silent is not a politically defensible position. There is still a chance to stop this industry before it begins, but only if governments stand up for science, equity, and precaution now, and take action to prevent companies within their jurisdiction from cooperating with rogue mining operations.” Yet, at such a pivotal moment, donations to Truthout have been declining.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But the most recent clashes, which erupted on Thursday, have been fuelled by another factor: a bitter feud between two powerful political patriarchs. Hun Sen has, over the years, supported Thaksin's family during their long-running power struggle with Thailand's military. Thaksin and his sister Yingluck stayed at Hun Sen's home after they were ousted from power, while Hun Sen appointed Thaksin an economic adviser to the Cambodian government. Thaksin frequently visited Cambodia, and Hun Sen was the first foreign guest to see the former Thai leader after he returned home after more than 15 years in self-imposed exile. The exact reasons for their feud are unclear, but analysts say it has created an additional layer of volatility that is exacerbating deadly clashes on the neighbouring countries' border. In the call, which was about the border dispute, Paetongtarn called Hun Sen “uncle” and told him if there was anything he wanted, she would “take care of it”. She also made disparaging comments about a senior Thai military commander. She was suspended from office by the constitutional court in July pending an investigation into ethical violations. It's not clear why Hun Sen chose to turn on his former friends. He has accused Thaksin of betrayal and threatened to reveal further sensitive information about the Shinawatras. “I never imagined someone so close could act this way,” Thaksin said later, declaring their friendship over. Others suggest Hun Sen has been angered by Thailand's efforts to crack down on so-called “scam compounds” where trafficked workers are held and forced to target people around the world with online scams. Whatever his motivations, Hun Sen has succeeded in damaging Thaksin's position, exploiting divisions between his family and the military, and creating a power vacuum in Thailand. Hun Sen, meanwhile, “holds near absolute control in Cambodia”, adds Tita. He has stamped out virtually all opposition voices and independent media. “When he chooses to take a strong stance, militarily or politically, it has immediate and direct consequences.” On Thursday night, Thaksin said he had thanked countries that had offered to mediate the border dispute, but would like to wait, adding: “We need to let the Thai military do their job, and first teach this cunning Hun Sen a lesson.” However awkward questions about his friend turned foe are likely to continue. As he visited communities sheltering from the conflict in Ubon Ratchathani, in northeastern Thailand, a woman confronted him: “You're Hun Sen's friend, aren't you? Why do you allow Cambodia to shoot Thai people?” Solving territorial disagreements is difficult in any context, said Pavin Chachavalpongpun, professor at the Center for Southeast Asian Studies at Kyoto University. “No country would like to sacrifice any inch of sovereignty,” he said. But the personal conflict between Hun Sen and Thaksin has, he added, made their countries' dispute even more unpredictable.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The leaders of Cambodia and Thailand have agreed to meet for ceasefire talks after days of cross-border violence, according to statements on Saturday from both sides as well as US President Donald Trump. Trump said earlier in the weekend that he had spoken with both Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and acting prime minister of Thailand Phumtham Wechayachai in his efforts to restore peace. Trump said he had warned Hun Manet and Phumtham that he would not make trade deals with either country if the deadly border conflict continued. Earlier this month, Trump wrote letters to Thailand and Cambodia threatening a 36% tariff on most of their exports to the US, starting August 1. In the early hours of Sunday morning local time, Hun Manet thanked Trump and said that Cambodia agreed with “the proposal for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire between the two armed forces.” It added that he had previously called for a ceasefire to ASEAN chair and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. A statement from Thailand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs was more measured, saying it wished to see “sincere intention from the Cambodian side” – but that Phumtham had also “requested President Trump to convey …that Thailand wants to convene a bilateral dialogue as soon as possible to bring forth measures and procedures for the ceasefire and the eventual peaceful resolution of the conflict.” Bangkok and Phnom Penh have been fighting over territory disputed since colonial power France drew the border between them more than a century ago. The renewed deadly conflict pits longtime US ally Thailand, with decades of experience, against Cambodia's relatively young armed force with close ties to China. Since fighting broke out on Thursday, more than a dozen people have been reported killed, dozens wounded, and more than 150,000 civilians evacuated. Clashes have continued into Saturday, according to officials on both sides. The United Nations has condemned the violence, with Secretary General António Guterres offering his assistance “in any efforts towards a peaceful resolution of the dispute” in a statement released Saturday by his spokesperson.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump, who said he held separate calls with the Prime Minister of Cambodia and acting Prime Minister of Thailand, claimed that both countries, “have agreed to immediately meet and quickly work out a Ceasefire and, ultimately, PEACE!” The news came shortly after Trump called publicly on both parties to negotiate peace amid escalating violence on the disputed border between Thailand and Cambodia. Bangkok and Phnom Penh have been fighting over territory disputed since colonial power France drew the border between them more than a century ago. The renewed deadly conflict pits longtime US ally Thailand, with decades of experience, against Cambodia's relatively young armed force with close ties to China. Since fighting broke out on Thursday, more than a dozen people have been reported killed, dozens wounded, and more than 150,000 civilians evacuated. Clashes have continued into Saturday, according to officials on both sides. Thailand's military dwarfs that of neighboring Cambodia, both in personnel and weaponry. “Thailand has a large, well-funded military and its air force is one of the best equipped and trained in Southeast Asia,” the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) wrote in its “Military Balance 2025” look at the world's armed forces. Meanwhile, a 2024 ranking of the military capabilities of 27 regional nations by the Lowy Institute places Thailand at 14th, to Cambodia's 23rd. Such a disparity is perhaps to be expected, given Thailand has four times as many people as Cambodia, and a GDP more than 10 times larger. Overall, with factors including military, economic, diplomatic and cultural power weighed in the Lowy Asia Power Index, Thailand is ranked 10th, considered a middle power, just behind Indonesia but ahead of countries including Malaysia and Vietnam. Lowy ranks Cambodia as a minor power in Asia, grouped with countries such as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Laos. In an earlier Truth Social post on Saturday, Trump said he has spoken to the acting prime minister of Thailand, Phumtham Wechayachai. “I have just spoken to the Acting Prime Minister of Thailand, and it was a very good conversation,” he wrote. “Thailand, like Cambodia, wants to have an immediate Ceasefire, and PEACE. Thailand's military has long been a major player in the kingdom's politics. Strong ties between Washington and Bangkok have endured. Thailand is classed as a major non-NATO ally by the US, giving it special benefits that have enabled it to enjoy access to decades of US support for its weapons programs. Despite all that history with Washington, these days the Thai military tries to maintain a more neutral approach to military policy, increasing ties with China in the past decade. Not wanting to rely on any one country as its arms supplier, it has also developed a strong domestic weapons industry, with the help of countries such as Israel, Italy, Russia, South Korea and Sweden, the “Military Balance” report says. Cambodia's military is young in comparison to Thailand's, established in 1993 after forces of the communist government were merged with two non-communist resistance armies, according to the IISS. “Cambodia's most important international defense links are with China and Vietnam. Despite a traditional reliance on Russia for defense equipment, China has emerged as a key supplier,” the IISS says. Beijing has even developed a naval base in Cambodia. The Ream Naval Base, on the Gulf of Thailand, would be able to host Chinese aircraft carriers, according to international analysts. Cambodia and China completed the seventh edition of their annual Golden Dragon joint military exercise in May, which was touted as the largest ever and featured live-fire training scenarios. Related article Violence is flaring again on the Thai-Cambodian border. “China and Cambodia are iron-clad friends who… always support each other. The two militaries enjoy unbreakable relations and rock-solid brotherhood,” Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Senior Col. Wu Qian told a press conference in February, when asked about possible fissures in relations. “Cambodia currently lacks the ability to design and manufacture modern equipment for its armed forces,” the IISS report says. Bolstered by years of US support, the Royal Thai Air Force is well equipped, with at least 11 modern Swedish Gripen fighter jets and dozens of older, US-made F-16 and F-5 jets, according to the IISS. Cambodia has no combat-capable air force to speak of. Cambodia has about 200 old Chinese- and Soviet-made tanks, the “Military Balance” shows. Cambodia has only a dozen 155mm guns with around 400 smaller towed artillery pieces, according to IISS figures. Cambodia has only a few dozen older Soviet and Chinese transport helicopters. Hawaii-based military analyst Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center, said that while Thailand has the numerical and qualitative military advantage, Cambodia has at least one thing in its favor – the actual land along the disputed border. “Terrain favors access from Cambodian territory to the disputed area,” Schuster told CNN. And with Cambodian forces allegedly  laying landmines and booby traps in the disputed area, Thailand can be expected to rely on longer-range weaponry, he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For now, he is secure inside a ring of steel When president Donald Trump stepped off Air Force One on to Scottish soil, he had one thing on his mind. Minutes later, he climbed into the Beast – his armoured limousine - to travel 35 minutes along country lanes and through Scottish villages, lined with supporters, protesters, and the merely curious, to Turnberry. For now, though, he is secure inside a ring of steel. It now sits inside an eight-foot fence, its fairways dotted with burly men in dark suits and earpieces. Mr Trump arrived with his golf clubs for four days at his two Scottish courses but without some of the trappings of a travelling American president. He travelled with a stripped-down retinue of aides. His public weekend schedule showed no planned events. Instead, it was a chance to spend time at his golf course with his sons Eric, who manages the family businesses, and Don Jr. Officials insisted that this was a “working trip” including a meeting with Sir Keir Starmer on Monday, although they were vague on agenda items. Yet all that changed shortly before Mr Trump flew out of Washington, when Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, announced on X that she would be meeting Mr Trump on Sunday as she closes in on a trade deal: Following a good call with @POTUS, we have agreed to meet in Scotland on Sunday to discuss transatlantic trade relations, and how we can keep them strong. EU members have drawn up a retaliatory hit list. The plan is to impose 30pc tariffs on bourbon whisky, yachts, soybeans and other American products if a deal cannot be reached by August 1 to lift US levies. Mrs von der Leyen had better tread carefully. Mr Trump's chat with reporters at Glasgow Prestwick Airport showed a president relaxed and looking forward to four days of golf, but one who was quick to bristle when it came to policy and politics. Mr Trump left Washington bugged by the drip, drip, drip of headlines about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire paedophile who took his own life in a jail cell six years ago. He flashed irritation and lobbed sharp words at reporters who asked him how much he knew about the case on Friday, but relaxed as soon as he could talk about the love of his life: golf and the course at Turnberry. “Sean Connery helped get me the permits,” he claimed after landing. There is a lesson for European leaders looking to muscle in on his tee times with their trade demands or for John Swinney, the Scottish First Minister, who is likely to tell Mr Trump that his tariffs are hurting the Scotch whisky industry. When the chat with reporters turned from golf to more substantial matters, he said he had a simple message for Europe. “On immigration, you better get your act together,” he said in another flash of passion. Anyone meeting with Mr Trump will remember the lessons of Volodymyr Zelensky's Oval Office row. The Ukrainian president was roundly chastised by Mr Trump and his vice president for daring to push back on the US position. And by hosting leaders at his Turnberry and Aberdeenshire courses, Mr Trump retains home advantage even while on foreign soil. On Saturday, all that was far from Mr Trump's mind. He spent the day golfing with son Eric, and his ambassador to London. Mr Trump, wearing a white USA cap and dressed in black, waved at the mound before teeing off in the direction of Turnberry lighthouse. A temporary watchtower had been erected to monitor the Turnberry perimeter with a sniper rifle trained on the course below. A drone scanned from above, and police boats patrolled the coastal waters. Fears that the visit would be a magnet for protesters appeared unfounded. Matt Halliday, from Stranraer, said he had been driving around for two hours trying and failing to find protests to join. He said Mr Trump had “stamped all over Scotland” with his grand golf resort plans, strong-arming local farmers and “bullying” the council over wind farm plans. “I think it is going to bring him down,” he said. However, supporters were easier to find than protesters. Two wearing red “Make England Great Again” hats arrived shortly after the president had disappeared over the crest of a dune. Tom English, a 38-year-old driver, said the pair had driven up from Liverpool last night to catch a glimpse of the president. Mr English said he would return on Sunday and hopefully get within “shouting distance” to offer words of encouragement to the president and cheer on his cost-cutting Doge unit. Mr Trump has long blurred the line between family, business and public life. But any world leader intruding on his golfing getaway had better be ready for a possible sharp response.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Venezuelans back home under Maduro-Trump deal tell of isolation, beatings and dirty water – ‘a living nightmare' Venezuelans that the Trump administration expelled to El Salvador's most notorious megaprison endured “state-sanctioned torture”, lawyers for some of the men have said, as more stories emerge about the horrors they faced during capacity. When José Manuel Ramos Bastidas – one of 252 Venezuelan men that the US sent to El Salvador's most notorious mega-prison – finally made it back home to El Tocuyo on Tuesday, the first thing he did was stretch his arms around his family. It was the first time they had hugged him since he left Venezuela last year. And it was the first time they could be sure – truly sure – that he was alive and well since he disappeared into the Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo (Cecot) in March. “We have been waiting for this moment for months, and I feel like I can finally breathe,” said Roynerliz Rodríguez, Ramos Bastidas's partner. “These last months have been a living nightmare, not knowing anything about José Manuel and only imagining what he must be suffering. I am happy he is free from Cecot, but I also know that we will never be free of the shadow of this experience. There must be justice for all those who suffered this torture.” Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan president, negotiated a prisoner swap that released 10 American citizens in his custody and dozens of Venezuelan political prisoners in exchange for the release of his citizens from Cecot. This week, after undergoing medical and background checks, they are finally reuniting with their families. Their testimonies of what they experienced inside Cecot are providing the first, most detailed pictures of the conditions inside Cecot, a mega-prison that human rights groups say is designed to disappear people. Ramos Bastidas and other US deportees were told that they were condemned to spend 30 to 90 years in Cecot unless the US president ordered otherwise, he told his lawyers. In interviews with the media and in testimony provided to their lawyers, other detainees described lengthy beatings and humiliation by guards. After some detainees tried to break the locks on their cell, prisoners were beaten for six consecutive days, the Atlantic reports. Male guards reportedly brought in female colleagues, who beat the naked prisoners and recorded videos. Quintero Chacón, who has scars from daily beatings, also said that he and other inmates were only provided soap and an opportunity to bathe on days when visitors were touring the prison – forcing them to choose between hygiene and public humiliation. Lights were on all night, so detainees could never fully rest. In El Tocuyo, in the Venezuelan state of Lara, and had been working since he was a teenager to support his family. Last year, he decided to leave his country – which has yet to recover from an economic collapse – to seek better income, so he could pay for medical care for his infant with severe asthma. He made an appointment using the now-defunct CBP One phone application to apply for asylum – but immigration officials and a judge determined that he did not qualify. But Customs and Border Protection agents had flagged Ramos Bastidas as a possible member of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, based on an unsubstantiated report from Panamanian officials and his tattoos. In December, Venezuela wasn't accepting deportees – so Ramos Bastidas asked if he could be released and make his own way home. A month later, Donald Trump was sworn in as president. On 14 March, he shared with his family that maybe he would be able to come back to Venezuela after all, after officials began prepping him for deportation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia will reinforce its Black Sea Fleet with marine robotic systems, warships, and additional aircraft, Nikolai Patrushev, the head of Russia's Maritime Collegium, said in an interview with the state-run RIA Novosti published on July 25. The Black Sea Fleet, headquartered in Sevastopol since Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, has suffered significant losses during the war against Ukraine. Despite these setbacks, Patrushev emphasized the fleet's strategic importance, claiming it remains critical for countering NATO and continuing military operations against Ukraine. Ukraine has destroyed or disabled at least 29 Russian vessels, according to the Ukrainian General Staff. Patrushev, 74, a longtime ally of Putin and often described as the architect of Russia's war against Ukraine, has held influential positions in Russia's security apparatus for decades. Tim Zadorozhnyy is a news editor at The Kyiv Independent. Tim began his career at a local television channel in Odesa. After moving to Warsaw, he joined the Belarusian opposition media outlet NEXTA, starting as a news anchor and later advancing to the position of managing editor. Russian forces launched an overnight attack on Ukraine's northeastern Sumy Oblast on July 26, targeting civilian infrastructure and leaving three people injured, local authorities reported. The Vatican confirmed that Pope Leo received Metropolitan Anthony, the senior Russian Orthodox Church cleric who chairs its department of external church relations, along with five other high-profile clerics, during a morning audience on July 26. According to operational data by Ukraine's Khortytsia group of forces, Colonel Lebedev was leading assault operations in the Velykyi Burluk area of Kharkiv Oblast. Russian forces launched a drone strike on Sumy on July 26, damaging the building of the Sumy Regional Military Administration, regional governor Oleh Hryhorov reported. Lithuania plans to contribute up to 30 million euro ($32.5 million) toward the joint purchase of U.S.-made Patriot air defense systems for Ukraine, Lithuanian public broadcaster LRT reported on July 26. "Resistance to the Kremlin regime inside Russia is growing," Ukraine's military intelligence agency said. U.S. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal co-authored a bipartisan bill that would impose 500% tariffs on countries buying Russian oil, gas, or uranium. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko is facilitating transit primarily to Poland, with some migrants arriving from Libya directly or through Russia — pointing to coordinated efforts between Minsk and Moscow.

VILNIUS, July 26. /TASS/. Vilnius will allocate 30 mln euros for the purchase of US Patriot anti-aircraft missile systems for Ukraine, Lithuanian Defense Minister Dovile Sakaliene told the BNS agency following a meeting of Baltic states' defense chiefs with their American colleague Pete Hegseth.

"Lithuania has announced its position that it will join the purchase of US-produced weapons, specifically the acquisition of Patriot systems, allocating about 30 mln euros for this purpose," the agency quoted the minister as saying.

"In this way, we are sending a strategic message that we fully share this decision of US President Donald Trump," Sakaliene noted.

Trump said earlier that Washington would continue transferring weapons and military equipment to Ukraine if Europe pays for the supplies. Coordination will be carried out by NATO. According to the American president, the deliveries will include 17 Patriot systems.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nathan Albers will profit again — his Disaster Management Group is contracted to build the US's largest detention camp. If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox. Unmentioned was that one of the subcontractors slated to work on the project, Disaster Management Group, is owned by Nathan Albers, who previously co-owned a company that pleaded guilty in 2019 to a scheme to hire undocumented workers and conceal them from immigration authorities. Albers is a big-time Republican donor who has spent time at Mar-a-Lago. Never miss the news and analysis you care about. In response to questions from ProPublica, a spokesperson for Disaster Management said that Albers and Disaster Management had been dropped from the DHS' investigation of TentLogix and exonerated. Upon learning of illegal actions by TentLogix's co-founder, the spokesperson said, “Mr. Albers parted ways as a minority and non-operating owner of TentLogix.” The White House didn't answer questions about Disaster Management or Albers, referring ProPublica to the DOD and DHS, neither of which provided comment. The prime contractor is Virginia-based Acquisition Logistics, and people with direct knowledge of the work at Fort Bliss told ProPublica that Amentum, a major engineering and technology services contractor, will be another subcontractor. Neither Acquisition Logistics nor Amentum replied to questions from ProPublica about the project. Last year, the Department of Labor announced that it had found Disaster Management and subcontractors it worked with on the Afghan refugee contract violated federal labor laws, including those on minimum wages and overtime. The agency recovered nearly $16 million in pay for workers, and Disaster Management signed a compliance agreement with the agency designed to prevent further violations. Albers' ties to TentLogix wouldn't have excluded him or Disaster Management from other government contracting work, explained Scott Amey, the general counsel at the Project On Government Oversight. TentLogix reported its criminal conviction in the federal contracting database, but Albers and his other businesses are considered separate legal entities. Companies awarded federal contracts are required to certify that they operate with a satisfactory record of business ethics, but “a lot of things are not required to be reported,” Amey said. “I don't even think this would appear on the radar of a contracting officer.” Still, there's a web of connections between TentLogix and Disaster Management. Albers was one of TentLogix's two directors when it pleaded guilty to violating immigration law. When immigration authorities raided TentLogix in 2018, it shared an address with Disaster Management. That year, Albers was listed as one of four officers on the company's corporate filings. (He served a little over three months, then was granted an early release because of the pandemic.) TentLogix, the corporate entity, also pleaded guilty and was ordered to forfeit over $3 million. Although Albers was not personally charged, he signed off on the company's guilty plea, court records show. Hendry did not respond to a request for comment. Disaster Management's federal contracting work has been lucrative for Albers. Last year, he purchased a $30 million house in Jupiter, Florida, that then ranked as the area's most expensive home. They attended the “Crypto Ball,” a cryptocurrency event sponsored by Trump supporters in the digital currency industry; participants paid between $2,500 and $1 million for tickets. (The Trump Organization did not respond to questions from ProPublica.) Since late last year, Disaster Management has spent $210,000 lobbying Congress and the administration on immigration-related issues, including “funding related to temporary facilities.” The company had no prior history of lobbying, according to federal disclosures. The Fort Bliss award comes as immigration arrests have soared in recent months and ICE is running low on space to hold everyone it has detained. The administration has eyed military bases as locations to set up these new detention camps. ICE abruptly canceled that contract just days after it was announced without explanation. Now it appears Disaster Management could do much of that work. Earlier in the month, Trump signed a spending bill that allocates $45 billion to build new migrant detention sites. Experts estimate this could roughly double the country's capacity for immigration detention from around 50,000 people to more than 100,000.

BUDAPEST, July 26. /TASS/. The threat of a third world war keeps growing, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said, adding that the international community should do everything it can to prevent it.

"Perhaps the most important question now is whether there will be a third world war, and the answer is that the likelihood of a world war is constantly increasing," he said in an address broadcast by the M1 TV channel.

As evidence, Orban cited the results of polls in six major countries, whose citizens consider the threat of a new world war to be quite real. The opinion that "in 5-10 years a third world war will break out is held by 55% of the French, 50% of the Spanish, 46% of the Italians, 45% of the Americans, 41% of the British, and 41% of the Germans," the premier added." "The whole world feels the cold wind of war," he noted.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At its peak, it accounted for more than half of the world's publicly-traded capital. John Rapley is a contributing columnist for The Globe and Mail. Among the G7 economies, only Italy's isn't in record territory and even Japan, which looked to have entered terminal decline after its 1990 crash, is now back within touching distance of those long-ago highs. House prices as well are near their all-time highs in most places, slightly off their recent peaks but still far above where they ever were before. And that's nothing compared with crypto and gold – bitcoin is up more than a quarter this year, gold nearly a third. Which is kind of strange, because our economies are barely moving. Currency effects make the discrepancy even more dramatic, leaving the U.S. market down in euro and peso terms, and pretty much flat in Canadian dollars. Lofty U.S. stock valuations bank on tech-heavy market's earnings strength Given how much smaller than the U.S. these markets are, flows of this scale have an outsized impact on prices. As a result, the laggards of the past decade, such as Spain, Hong Kong, South Africa and Britain, have become winners, with a small share of repatriated investment making for big rallies. This rebalancing was always bound to happen at some point, but Mr. Trump's policies are accelerating it. Though presenting the trade “deals” he's now rolling out as wins, because other countries have to “pay” higher tariffs than the U.S., it's an odd victory when your consumers must pay more for their goods than foreigners. After Mr. Trump announced his trade deal with Japan this week, Toyota's share price shot up 15 per cent, but Ford's barely budged. That's because the price of a Toyota car will increase by 15 per cent, but Ford's will probably rise more, since the company must pay tariffs on all its inputs. The same is happening in bond markets, where the spread between U.S. government bonds and those of other countries, especially emerging markets, is narrowing. As the U.S. looks less investable, other countries lure capital back away from it. To this reallocation of investment one can add the massive amount of stimulus now entering the global pipeline – the tax cuts in Mr. Trump's Big Beautiful Bill, Germany's big stimulus program, NATO's rearmament, Japan's fiscal loosening: There's a lot of bond issuance coming, which will pump money into the world economy. The monetary tightening that had followed the 2021-22 inflation spike has now given way to an increase in global money supply that's running at an annual rate of more than 7 per cent. In the U.S., first-time homebuyers are spending a higher share of their income on mortgage payments today than they were before the 2008 crash, leaving less to spend or invest on other things, while squeezing future demand. The same is happening in Canada, and as we know one consequence of the rising cost of living is that voters are demanding a reduction in immigration. If voters don't always favour the harsh measures being taken against immigrants in the U.S., nonetheless virtually all Western countries are starting to clamp down on inflows. That is cutting off one of the few remaining sources of growth in Western economies, namely the rise in labour supply. Sooner or later, in short, markets will realign with the economy. Whatever stimulus effects come from government's fiscal largesse, the impact of tariffs and slow growth in the labour market owing to immigration cutbacks will drag down growth. Investors are still pricing shares as if the good days will keep rolling. But this fall may bring a chill to markets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The bronze bust of William Lyon Mackenzie sits on a tall plinth tucked away in Toronto's Queen's Park. Earlier this summer, Andy Filipowich was here to take in the statue. “But in the online world, anyone can stumble on any information.” Since Wikipedia was founded nearly a quarter of a century ago, fortified by co-founder Jimmy Wales's goal to “help the internet not suck,” it has consistently ranked as one of the top 10 most visited websites worldwide. Free of ads and profit-seeking corporate overlords, and maintained by dedicated volunteers, Wikipedia is arguably one of the last best places on the internet. In any given month, Wikipedia gets more than four billion page views globally, but only a tiny sliver of those visitors will actually make edits to the website. The internet runs on these kinds of quiet acts of online altruism: the unsung heroes who upload fresh menus on Google, moderate Reddit forums, or post honest product reviews on Amazon amid the flood of fake ones. Over the past two decades, Wikipedia has faced various threats, including censorship from hostile governments and nefarious sock puppet accounts hijacking articles. Editors are fearful that as more people use AI chatbots such as ChatGPT or Gemini to find information, they won't need Wikipedia. Andy Filipowich's first big project was overhauling William Lyon Mackenzie's Wikipedia page.Galit Rodan/The Globe and Mail A Canadian history buff, Mr. Filipowich has been an active editor since 2020. While sitting at home during COVID lockdown, he clicked the “random article” button on Wikipedia's main page and landed on a gas explosion in Toronto's Etobicoke neighbourhood in the early 2000s. The article didn't have much information, so he started adding new details. For a year, he read multiple biographies, dug through newspaper archives and made tweaks based on feedback from other editors. At 16, she created the page for Canadian journalist and archivist Katherine Hughes, which was featured on Wikipedia's front page in the “Did you know” section. “I was completely ecstatic the whole day,” says Ms. Clover. Earlier this year, she wrote Wikipedia's first article ever on ketchup chips, excavating every mention she could find of the food in newspaper archives and reading a book about the history of Canadian snacks. For Ms. Clover, part of her motivation is the community she's built. She's made a lot of friends on Wikipedia, finding kinship with fellow nerds who are happy to geek out about the credibility of sources and discuss ways to improve the website. It's like a bunch of bookworms everywhere,” she says. That sense of community is also what keeps Enoch Leung, 27, volunteering with Wikipedia. He started editing when he was 12, and over the next couple years, began working on some of the maintenance aspects of Wikipedia, such as monitoring new edits for vandalism. He's attended meetups with other Toronto-based editors, including recently visiting the Toronto Islands to take photos for Wikimedia Commons. “In a world where the internet feels increasingly dystopian as algorithms dictate what we see and think … it's refreshing to be part of a website that isn't any of that – and perhaps a little intimidating too,” says Mr. Leung. There's a stark gender gap among its editors – about 80 per cent are men – and in its content too, with women accounting for only 20 per cent of biographical entries. Earlier this year, Elon Musk said it's “an extension of legacy media propaganda” and called for the website to be “defunded.” But the biggest concern right now is AI chatbots. People are increasingly using chatbots to seek out information they would have once found on Wikipedia. Some editors and researchers worry fewer people will visit the website directly. Opinion: Elon Musk's hate for Wikipedia reveals his true views on free speech In many ways, it's sort of magical that people will just volunteer without explicit economic incentives to create artifacts that are meant to share knowledge with everyone in the world,” says Nicholas Vincent, an assistant professor at Simon Fraser University who has studied how Wikipedia helps support Google searches. It may just take time to figure out what those best-use cases are. “I remember going through school and Wikipedia being the new big scary thing in education,” Mr. Filipowich says. “AI has become the new form of that, and I just think it's because we don't quite know how to use it yet.” Dr. Vincent says there are ways in which tech companies like OpenAI and Google can help prevent the deterioration of Wikipedia, including by changing the design of their chatbots to encourage users to click through to the website. Ms. Clover is concerned about AI slop infiltrating the website, how the chatbots can make up information, including sources, and how that could lead to a greater distrust online. However, she's not too worried about AI leading to a decline in editors. Walking around Queen's Park earlier this summer, Mr. Filipowich was quick to pull out his phone and look up facts on Wikipedia – how old Mackenzie was when he died (66) or to confirm the alibi of a former Toronto mayor accused of being at the Upper Canada Rebellion (he wouldn't be wearing sunglasses at night, like his accuser claimed). He's about three-quarters through one of Brown's two-volume biographies. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko is again using his country's territory to funnel illegal migrants from Africa, the Middle East, and Afghanistan toward the European Union, Ukraine's Foreign Intelligence Service said on July 26. "This blackmail did not work," Ukraine's intelligence service said, noting that the response instead intensified Belarus' diplomatic isolation. While Lukashenko reportedly profits from the migrant flows, he has so far avoided full-scale escalation, likely in an effort to preserve his few remaining political ties in Europe. "Lukashenko, despite his reputation as a satellite of Russia's dictator Vladimir Putin, retains autonomy in matters of tactics — and once again demonstrates a willingness to use it to exert political pressure on the West," the agency said. Poland, one of the EU's front-line states, has long accused Belarus and Russia of waging a hybrid war by deliberately directing migrants toward its borders. One soldier was killed and 63 others injured in related border clashes. Lukashenko has ruled Belarus since 1994 and remains a key ally of the Kremlin. His regime has allowed Russian troops and equipment to use Belarusian territory to attack Ukraine at the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. Tim Zadorozhnyy is a news editor at The Kyiv Independent. Tim began his career at a local television channel in Odesa. After moving to Warsaw, he joined the Belarusian opposition media outlet NEXTA, starting as a news anchor and later advancing to the position of managing editor. The Vatican confirmed that Pope Leo received Metropolitan Anthony, the senior Russian Orthodox Church cleric who chairs its department of external church relations, along with five other high-profile clerics, during a morning audience on July 26. According to operational data by Ukraine's Khortytsia group of forces, Colonel Lebedev was leading assault operations in the Velykyi Burluk area of Kharkiv Oblast. Russian forces launched a drone strike on Sumy on July 26, damaging the building of the Sumy Regional Military Administration, regional governor Oleh Hryhorov reported. Lithuania plans to contribute up to 30 million euro ($32.5 million) toward the joint purchase of U.S.-made Patriot air defense systems for Ukraine, Lithuanian public broadcaster LRT reported on July 26. "Resistance to the Kremlin regime inside Russia is growing," Ukraine's military intelligence agency said. U.S. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal co-authored a bipartisan bill that would impose 500% tariffs on countries buying Russian oil, gas, or uranium. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko is facilitating transit primarily to Poland, with some migrants arriving from Libya directly or through Russia — pointing to coordinated efforts between Minsk and Moscow. Kharkiv's Kyviskyi district has been hit twice by ballistic missiles.</p>
