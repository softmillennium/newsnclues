                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins BlockDAG, ONDO, PENGU, and TAO have emerged as focal points in the cryptocurrency market, each leveraging distinct strategies to capture investor interest amid evolving industry trends. These projects, highlighted for their technological innovation, cultural resonance, and real-world utility, are reshaping perceptions of what drives success in the crypto space. BlockDAG (BDAG) is generating momentum through its DAG-based Layer 1 blockchain, designed to address scalability and speed challenges in traditional blockchains. The presale raised $353 million, with 24.3 billion BDAG sold at $0.0016. Its social media engagement exceeds billions, and a recent ETF filing positions it to outperform other meme projects. Bittensor (TAO) merges AI and blockchain by creating a decentralized network for machine learning models. Unlike speculative AI-linked projects, Bittensor already demonstrates real earnings and developer activity. As decentralized AI gains traction in 2025, TAO's role in this space is seen as pivotal, combining blockchain's transparency with AI's scalability [1]. This model attracts institutional investors seeking crypto exposure with lower volatility compared to speculative assets. As Ethereum faces congestion, Ondo's RWA-focused approach offers an alternative for long-term value creation. While all four projects show promise, BlockDAG stands out for its active ecosystem and early traction. The project's working tools, developer partnerships, and presale performance suggest it is already scaling rather than merely preparing to do so. Pudgy Penguins' brand growth, Bittensor's AI integration, and Ondo's RWA model each carve unique niches, but BlockDAG's operational momentum makes it a standout in the 2025 crypto landscape [1].

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin (BTC) will no longer experience “parabolic” price rallies or “devastating” bear markets, because BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have permanently reduced volatility and altered market dynamics, according to Blockware BTC analyst Mitchell Askew. Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote that the reduced volatility has helped Bitcoin “attract even bigger fish and gives it a fighting chance to be adopted as currency.”  The tradeoff to this is that there will likely be no more “God Candles,” the analyst added. Related: Robert Kiyosaki warns of the risk posed by BTC, gold, and silver ETFs Bitcoin ETFs sequester capital into traditional investment vehicles that currently lack in-kind redemption and keep funds off-chain. This stowing away of capital can prevent the rotation into altcoins, which crypto investors have come to expect from previous market cycles. In July, net inflows into Bitcoin ETFs crossed the $50 billion mark, though the surge of capital into Bitcoin has not translated to increased onchain activity. Retail investors are shifting into Bitcoin ETFs and gaining exposure through traditional financial instruments held by a fund manager or another financial fiduciary on their behalf, rather than holding BTC directly, according to analysts. The demand for paper BTC and products like BlockRock's Bitcoin ETF has led the asset manager to accumulate 3% of Bitcoin's total supply, raising concerns about centralization among some market participants.

Asphere, the enterprise division of Ankr, has officially announced the launch of Solana Permissioned Environments (SPEs), a new blockchain solution tailored specifically for enterprise use. On Friday, July 25, Ankr announced it via its official X (previously Twitter) account. This will be a significant milestone in the mainstreaming of blockchain technology in regulated sectors, as it provides fully configurable, high-performance networks deployed on the Solana blockchain. Solana Permissioned Environments will help meet the increasing demand of businesses needing secure, scalable, and custom blockchain platforms. Asphere describes SPEs as custom blockchain networks on which enterprises can operate fully in their infrastructure and reap the benefits of Solana's performance and speed. Such environments give assurance to companies that want regulatory compliance, data privacy, and sovereignty of operations. SPEs have multiple benefits, as they are developed in close cooperation with the Solana ecosystem. Use cases-wise, SPEs are best suited to permissioned financial networks with custom validator settings, closed execution environments, and transaction-free gas. The key features of the SPE model include customizable network topology, support for Solana-native developer tools such as Solang and state compression, and flexible governance mechanisms. Block times, token economics, and validator logic can be customized according to enterprise business models. The company was recently crowned SOC 2 certified, which shows that it has audited, secure systems. This certification means that Asphere adheres to industrial best practices in data protection, incident response, system reliability, and vendor risk management. Asphere is currently completing the SOC 2 Type 2 audit to strengthen its security standards. Solana Permissioned Environments launch marks a significant step in the adoption of enterprise blockchain.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins Over the past 30 days, PENGU has surged 273.6%, climbing nearly 20% in a single 24-hour period as investors rotate into high-profile digital collectibles [1]. The token has broken through key Fibonacci resistance levels and exited a long-term accumulation range ($0.006–$0.021), forming a classic bullish trend with higher highs and higher lows [2]. The price rally has been amplified by strategic partnerships and brand expansion. Additionally, a deal with Suplay Inc. has opened access to China's multibillion-dollar collectibles market, enhancing the token's perceived utility beyond crypto [1]. These moves position Pudgy Penguins as a crossover brand rather than a niche digital asset, with its social gaming initiative, Pudgy Party, anticipated to further drive engagement. Analysts have drawn comparisons to PEPE's historic breakout, projecting a potential $0.24 price target for PENGU if the trajectory aligns [5]. A successful rebound could push the token toward $0.043–$0.046, with extension levels of $0.075 or $0.097 possible if momentum builds [3]. Retail investor enthusiasm has further fueled the rally, with PENGU's price climbing 14.3% in 24 hours and weekly gains nearing 40% amid broader meme coin speculation [8]. A spike in demand was also observed following Walmart's toy-related marketing initiatives, which linked to PENGU assets [9]. If PENGU fails to hold above critical support levels, it could retreat toward $0.023, a prior Fibonacci level. Analysts emphasize that sustained volume during key price tests will be crucial—without continued buying pressure, the rally may stall [3]. The PENGU surge reflects a broader trend of NFT-powered tokens gaining traction during altseason, but its success in maintaining momentum will depend on balancing growth with valuation sustainability.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins Fastex, a Dubai-based cryptocurrency exchange, has launched a series of collectible currency notes backed 1:1 by its native token FTN, marking what it claims is the first instance of an exchange issuing such physical-digital hybrid assets [1]. The initiative, developed over a year, combines banknote-grade anti-counterfeit features—such as serial numbers, intaglio ink, optically variable ink, and metallic security foil—with blockchain-based verification. Each note is redeemable for its full value in FTN tokens on the Fastex platform and includes an NFT that users can use to verify authenticity and access exclusive benefits like early product access, airdrops, and event invitations [1]. Authentix's involvement underscores the project's focus on security and authenticity, as highlighted by Joe Galloso, the firm's International Sales Director, who described the collaboration as a fusion of traditional banknote printing techniques and blockchain innovation [1]. The notes will be available for purchase starting July 1 via Yo Cash, a platform managed by Fastex and Authentix. Users must complete a KYC (Know Your Customer) verification process before acquiring the notes, which are backed by FTN tokens and redeemable at any time. The initiative also aims to enhance user engagement by offering holders additional perks, including early access to new products and participation in airdrops [1]. Fastex, which positions itself as a secure and accessible trading platform, has previously introduced services like the Bahamut EVM-based blockchain solution and the YoWallet. The exchange's leadership includes former traditional finance professionals, such as a former Deputy Chairman of a Central Bank, reflecting its strategy of bridging conventional and digital financial systems [1].</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Much of the volume centered on a sharp correction, when BNB dropped from $774.52 to $761.34 on volume more than twice the daily average, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. BNB's price traced a V-shaped recovery, ending near its high and well above the key $761 support zone. The rebound came after Windtree Therapeutics committed $520 million toward its planned BNB corporate treasury. Other companies, including Nano Labs, have also been betting on BNB, whose supply has been steadily dropping over Binance's and BNB Chain's token burns. Meanwhile, BNB Chain continues to grow its developer ecosystem. The platform announced the next cohort of its Most Valuable Builder accelerator, backing 15 early-stage startups working in AI, decentralized finance, and tokenized real-world assets. BNB is now showing signs of consolidation as it hovers around the $780 level, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto crooks are getting bolder — and now, they sound just like your mom. Global crypto scams soared 456% between May 2024 and April 2025 — becoming increasingly reliant on AI-generated voices, deepfake videos and phony credentials to fleece unsuspecting victims, blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs‘ Ari Redbord told The Post after testifying before Congress last Tuesday. In June, New York officials froze $300,000 in stolen cryptocurrency and seized more than 100 scam websites linked to a Vietnam-based ring that targeted Russian-speaking Brooklynites with fake Facebook investment ads. Meta shut down over 700 Facebook accounts tied to the scam. Investigators say the group used deepfake BitLicense certificates and moved victims onto encrypted apps like Telegram before draining their wallets. Florida-based crypto firm MoonPay saw its CEO Ivan Soto-Wright and CFO Mouna Ammari Siala duped into wiring $250,000 in crypto to a scammer posing as Trump inauguration co-chair Steve Witkoff, according to a recent Department of Justice complaint. Globally, fraudsters swiped more than $10.7 billion in 2024 through crypto cons — including romance scams, fake trading platforms and “pig-butchering,” where scammers build fake relationships before draining victims' accounts, Redbord said. But the real number is likely much higher. “Only around 15% of victims actually report these crimes,” Redbord said, citing shame, fear and distrust in law enforcement — particularly among older adults and immigrant communities. Crypto ATMs — especially those tucked inside New York delis and convenience stores. Illicit use at these kiosks is more than twice as high as in the broader crypto market, Redbord said. Victims are often directed to scan a QR code and deposit cash, instantly converting it to crypto before the funds disappear. House lawmakers wrapped up “Crypto Week” last Thursday by passing the first-ever comprehensive cryptocurrency legislation — a trio of bills focused on regulating stablecoins, trading platforms and digital asset infrastructure. Even so, Redbord advised, common sense is the best defense. “If something feels too good to be true — especially unsolicited investment advice — it almost always is,” he said. And when in doubt, report it — whether to IC3, Chainabuse or your local authorities.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pakistan's demographics position the country as a major catalyst for Bitcoin (BTC) adoption, allowing it to “leapfrog” developed nations, according to Bilal Bin Saqib, Pakistan's state minister of crypto and blockchain. “A global policy shift has happened, not just in Pakistan, but all around the world,” Bin Saqib told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview. The government of Pakistan moved to regulate crypto in November 2024. “Emerging markets are what will leapfrog the adoption of these new technologies,” the minister said, with smaller countries more likely to adopt Bitcoin due to their nimble size, allowing them to front-run developed countries. “It's easier to make a speedboat move than the Titanic,” Bin Saqib added.

Pakistan's National Crypto Council and other regulatory bodies are seeking input on a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets, licensing crypto exchanges, developing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, launching a stablecoin, and mining Bitcoin using excess energy, the minister said. Bin Saqib said the country is allocating 2,000 MW for Bitcoin mining and AI data centers. The government is also exploring the potential to mine BTC with runoff energy from methane and other excess or stranded power sources, he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wyoming isn't far from becoming the first U.S. state to issue its own stablecoin, moving closer to a potential showdown with Washington over how its dollar-pegged token should comply with certain restrictions signed into law last week after passage of the GENIUS Act. “We are confident that we can issue yield on our stable token,” Wyoming Democratic State Senator Chris Rothfuss, who chairs the state's Select Committee on Blockchain, Financial Technology, and Digital Innovation Technology, told Decrypt. The feature won't be enabled when WYST debuts later this year, but it is being implemented, Rothfuss said, noting that there are still logistical questions that lawmakers are working through. Rothfuss said that Wyoming lawmakers are considering other elements of the GENIUS Act, a comprehensive framework for regulating stablecoins that's expected to unlock additional participation, and competition, within the $280 billion industry dominated by Circle and Tether. “This bill regulates stablecoins and provides for the backdoor Centralized Bank Digital Currency,” she said on X last week. “This will open the door to move you to a cashless society and into digital currency that can be weaponized against you by an authoritarian government.” Although they are similar to stablecoins, they are not issued by private companies on public networks, prompting concerns among some lawmakers, including House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN). In March, Emmer told Decrypt that the Wyoming Stable Token amounts to a state-backed CBDC. In a recent interview with Decrypt, Apollo said the Commission has “the same concerns that any issuer will have about the potential nefarious use,” and it is trying to onboard blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis to monitor for illicit activity, alongside open-source intelligence firm Inca Digital. Still, Wyoming's Select Committee on Blockchain wrote in a letter earlier this month that the Commission must “resist pressure to act as a political or financial gatekeeper,” considering “heightened standards” imposed by the United States and Wyoming Constitutions. “We have a big delta from incumbents, who could just change their policies and say, ‘We can freeze your assets if you are trying to buy firearms,'” he said. That sentiment was echoed by Rothfuss, who noted that Wyoming's ability to navigate federal requests in a nuanced way has long been viewed by the state's lawmakers as a positive. “We have sovereignty, so when the government is in opposition, [...] they can't just send us a cease and desist letter and start arresting people.” U.S. President Donald Trump, after skewering the notion of a digital dollar on the campaign trail, signed an executive order earlier this year prohibiting federal agencies from working on CBDCs. That has led to conflicts over resources and what some Wyomingites describe as a “tall fence.” WYST is currently undergoing a pilot program, but the token is expected to debut in August at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium, on at least one network. Current candidates include Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche, among eight other networks. Hasfire CEO John Belitsky, who also serves as a subject matter advisor to the Commission, told Decrypt that other states may eventually join Wyoming, but its philosophy cannot be copied. “Other states can [launch their own tokens], but are they going to corporate with overreaching federal agencies?” The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of the crypto exchange Gemini, claimed that JPMorgan Chase halted its onboarding process for Gemini after he criticized the bank's new fee structure for fintech companies. Last week, Winklevoss publicly criticized JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon after Bloomberg reported the bank would start charging fintech platforms for access to customer banking data. Many of these platforms serve as bridges between traditional banks and crypto services. “This will bankrupt fintechs that help you link your bank accounts to crypto companies,” Winklevoss posted on X. JPMorgan didn't address Gemini directly but defended its decision, telling Forbes that nearly 2 billion monthly requests for user data come from third parties, most of them not tied to actual customer activity. By charging fees, the bank says it aims to curb misuse and protect consumers. JPMorgan had previously offboarded Gemini, as CoinDesk reported, during so-called Operation Choke Point 2.0, a period during which many crypto firms lost banking access under regulatory scrutiny. Gemini, which filed confidentially for an IPO earlier this month, has been offering an increasing number of services that recently started including tokenized stocks. Before joining CoinDesk he worked at major financial and crypto publications. He owns bitcoin, ether, solana, and PAXG above CoinDesk's $1,000 disclosure threshold.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>XRP selling pressure could mushroom if the recent 50 billion XRP sale from a wallet linked to Ripple's Chris Larsen was "just the warm-up." Larsen notionally has over 2.5 billion XRP left, which would create massive selling pressure if distributed. XRP/USD currently trades 13% below recent all-time highs, failing to recover after the sell-off. XRP (XRP) investors face new warnings over becoming “exit liquidity” after Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen moved 50 million tokens to exchanges. XRP hit near all-time highs above $3.60 on July 17, but the achievement was quickly overshadowed by large outflows from a wallet linked to Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen. As Cointelegraph reported, reactions on social media were mixed, with some seeing a reasonable profit-taking move and others accusing Larsen of deliberate offloading at the highs. Larsen, he suggested, could increase sell-side pressure by a huge factor should he choose to pull more of its balance. “Chris Larsen (Ripple co-founder) still holds 2.58B $XRP — that's $8.83B,” he wrote. XRP was one of the major altcoins leading the sector's comeback this month after Bitcoin (BTC) began consolidating. Currently at $3.18, according to Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView, XRP/USD has since corrected 13%. Other popular market participants joined the concerns, including trader ManLy. Larsen's presumed sales came as Bitcoin itself faced snap downside pressure as a Satoshi-era whale sold 80,000 BTC, which had previously been dormant for 14 years.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For a week, at least, spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds outpaced their Bitcoin counterparts. The nine ETFs tracking ETH generated more than $1.8 billion in net inflows this week, continuing a 16-day positive streak, according to U.K. asset manager Farside Investors, as interest in the second-largest cryptocurrency mushrooms. Bitcoin has historically been on top, but this week, Ethereum dominated crypto ETF flows. "Many [investors] own Bitcoin ETFs and are increasingly interested in diversifying," Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, a trade group, told Decrypt. "Ethereum is the second-largest digital asset, and the only other one available in [spot] ETF format—making it very easy to choose it in one's effort to improve their portfolio's diversification." ETH ETFs' spike comes amid a price surge intertwined with the growing popularity of these funds and the rise of Ethereum treasuries. Those trends accelerated as passage of the GENIUS Act stablecoin bill neared. Ethereum was recently trading at about $3,745, down roughly 3% from its seven-month high set earlier this week but up more than 50% over the past month. "Ethereum has been skyrocketing in price recently, after an extended period of underperformance compared to Bitcoin, and investors are notorious for buying assets after they've gone up in value and selling them after they've fallen—the exact opposite of what you're supposed to do," Edelman said. BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) led this week's charge, adding $1.29 billion in investments. On Wednesday, ETHA became the third-fastest fund in the ETF industry's 32-year history to reach $10 billion in assets under management (AUM)—251 days, according to Bloomberg data. In an interview with Decrypt, Juan Leon, senior investment strategist at ETF issuer Bitwise Asset Management, said that the Ethereum funds' performance this week caps a month of gains relative to BTC ETFs. Leon believes that the ETH funds will continue their momentum at least short-term, although he expects investors to return to Bitcoin ETFs in greater numbers in the second half of the year when major "wirehouse platforms," including Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo, begin offering the latter as trading options before "greenlighting" ETH ETFs. "That'll drive renewed flows into Bitcoin ETFs," he said. But right now, we seem to be at least in a short-term inflection point, and irrespective of the absolute numbers, from the point of view of how big one asset is in relation to the other, ETH will continue to punch above its weight over the coming weeks and months."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The rally followed an announcement by popular trading platform Robinhood that it had added support for the asset, increasing its exposure to a broad base of U.S. retail investors. The listing sent HBAR trading volumes sharply higher, with a mid-day breakout around 12:00 UTC on July 25 pushing prices through the $0.26 mark amid more than 713 million tokens traded in a single hour. Hedera, unlike traditional blockchains, operates on a unique hashgraph consensus model that allows for high-speed, low-cost transactions at scale. One analyst believe HBAR could have more room to run. On Friday, crypto analyst ChartNerd said on X that HBAR could be setting up for a major move higher — but only if it clears a key technical hurdle. Specifically, he pointed to a resistance level near $0.35, which he said aligns with something called the Supertrend indicator — a commonly used tool that helps traders identify when an asset may switch from a downtrend to an uptrend. According to ChartNerd, if HBAR can close above that level with strong momentum, the token could enter what traders call “price discovery” — a  stage where there are no prior highs to act as barriers. He cited Fibonacci extension levels, which are often used to estimate future price targets during strong uptrends, suggesting that HBAR could potentially rise to $1.26 or even $3.30 in a bullish scenario.
