                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ONBOARD: Lando Norris' 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the Belgian Grand Prix George Russell qualified sixth for the Belgian Grand Prix after Kimi Antonelli could manage only 18th place. George Russell admitted his concern that Mercedes had “taken a big step backwards” after another difficult qualifying session for the team at the Belgian Grand Prix. While Russell's sixth place for Sunday's Grand Prix may appear a strong result on paper, the Canadian Grand Prix race winner pointed to the fine margins that defined his session. “It was for sure, the maximum,” he said. “All of my laps were strong, but it's clear that, as a team, we've taken a big step backwards this weekend. “One tenth slower in Q1, I'd have been almost out. A tenth slower in Q3 and I'd have been P10. P6, I feel, is without doubt, the maximum we could have achieved.” Although his celebrations were halted as he was disqualified for his car being underweight, when asked if this gives him hope for this year's running, he added: “Yeah. Indeed, he is yet to score a point on European soil.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ONBOARD: Lando Norris' 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the Belgian Grand Prix 'I drove a tiny bit better' - Polesitter Norris on the small margins that made the difference in Spa Qualifying Max Verstappen has clinched his first Sprint win of the season at the Belgian Grand Prix weekend, the Red Bull driver holding on for victory after making an impressive overtake on Oscar Piastri during the opening lap of action. Despite Piastri's best efforts, Verstappen continued to defend his position and sealed a dominant win, with Piastri and Norris ultimately having to settle for second and third respectively. Charles Leclerc followed in fourth for Ferrari, despite briefly running ahead of Norris in the early stages, while Haas' Esteban Ocon, Williams' Carlos Sainz, the other Haas of Ollie Bearman and Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar followed in fifth through to eighth. After just one practice session on Friday, Sprint Qualifying had decided the grid for the third 100km dash of the season, a format that awards points to the top eight finishers from a maximum of eight for P1 down to one for P8. Ahead of the Sprint getting underway, one change was confirmed to the grid as Franco Colapinto – who had ended Sprint Qualifying in P19 – would start from the pit lane due to Alpine changing the rear wing of his A525 under parc ferme conditions. As the lights went out, Piastri made a strong start to lead away from pole position – but Verstappen was not ready to give up, the Dutchman making a stunning overtake by getting in Piastri's slipstream down the Kemmel straight to surge into P1. Elsewhere, Norris retook third place from Leclerc, whilst Alpine confirmed that Gasly had joined the Sprint two laps down, the team seemingly using the event as a test session. Further back, Antonelli made a move on Nico Hulkenberg to grab 17th place, the Italian looking to make up for his disappointing Sprint Qualifying. Piastri, meanwhile, looked to have kicked up a little gravel as he pushed hard in his pursuit of Verstappen. Antonelli was chasing Hamilton by Lap 9, the rookie looking to put pressure on the driver he replaced at Mercedes. Up ahead, Norris was now just six-tenths behind Piastri, with the Australian the same margin behind Verstappen. “I can't brake,” Verstappen reported, having had a slight moment at the last chicane. Further back, Alex Albon was also in fighting mode as he engaged in a close scrap with Fernando Alonso for P14. Norris was a further six-tenths back from Piastri in third place, ahead of Leclerc, Ocon, Sainz, Bearman and Hadjar in the remaining points-paying positions of fourth to eighth respectively. Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto and Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson completed the top 10 order, with Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda and the Mercedes of Russell just missing out in 11th and 12th. The Aston Martin pair of Lance Stroll and Alonso were P13 and P14, while Hamilton ended a difficult Sprint event in P15. Albon had to settle for 16th, followed by Antonelli, Hulkenberg and Colapinto in the final positions ahead of Gasly, who was classified as retired after his brief return to action. "It worked out really well," said Verstappen. "That is the only real opportunity that you're going to get against them, and we got it into Turn 5. I knew it was going to be very tough keeping them behind, so it was very much like cat and mouse with DRS, battery usage, and the whole race was within seven tenths. I couldn't afford to make big mistakes. I had one tiny hiccup into the last corner, but apart from that, it was a great result to keep them behind. To have a win here at Spa, for me, it's a Sprint win, but it still counts and I'm very happy with what we did out there.”</p>

Brad Benavides earned his and AIX Racing's first pole position in FIA Formula 3 with a superb final attempt to pip Championship leader Rafael Camara to the top spot. Camara recorded a time that put him on provisional pole earlier in Qualifying, but his final improvement was good enough only for second, though he was made to sweat going into the last attempt of the day. The Scuderia Ferrari Driver Academy member's 2:04.359 was deleted for exceeding track limits, leaving him 22nd before it was reinstated ahead of the chequered flag, promoting the TRIDENT driver back into second place. Completing the top three was Rodin Motorsport's Callum Voisin, who also took full advantage of the track improvement to go third quickest, 0.011s ahead of teammate Roman Bilinski in fourth. Martinius Stenshorne completed the top five for Hitech TGR and led fellow McLaren Development Driver Ugo Ugochukwu, the PREMA Racing talent following in sixth. Championship contender Nikola Tsolov wound up seventh for Campos Racing ahead of team mate Tasanapol Inthraphuvasak in P8. Charlie Wurz, Bruno del Pino and Noah Stromsted followed, with Freddie Slater set to go from reverse grid pole after ending up 12th on his second weekend in FIA F3 this season.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ONBOARD: Lando Norris' 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the Belgian Grand Prix 'I drove a tiny bit better' - Polesitter Norris on the small margins that made the difference in Spa Qualifying Lando Norris secured pole position for the Belgian Grand Prix in an exciting Qualifying session from Spa-Francorchamps. Lando Norris will start the Belgian Grand Prix from pole position after going fastest of all in Qualifying, the McLaren driver beating team mate Oscar Piastri and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc with an impressive lap around Spa-Francorchamps. That time proved unbeatable as the final laps played out, with Piastri ending up in second place just 0.085s away from the other papaya car. Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda followed in seventh, while the Racing Bulls pair of Isack Hadjar and Liam Lawson took eighth and ninth respectively and Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto completed the top 10. Off the back of his podium result last time out at Silverstone, Nico Hulkenberg qualified down in 14th for Kick Sauber, while Carlos Sainz wound up in 15th for Williams. It was also a tough Qualifying for Aston Martin, with Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll bringing up the rear in P19 and P20 respectively. There was early drama prior to Q1 getting underway, with Alonso reporting that he “nearly crashed” with Bearman after the Haas moved into the pit lane queue ahead of him, while Hulkenberg ended up with a damaged front wing following contact with the Aston Martin of Stroll, an incident that will be investigated after the session for an unsafe release. His time was then bettered by Norris, who went faster by 0.625s – while Piastri then slotted into second, but still just under two-tenths adrift of his team mate. Both Mercedes cars improved, with Antonelli slotting into 11th while Russell moved up to eighth. Meanwhile all eyes were on Hamilton as the seven-time World Champion found himself at risk. The Briton initially did enough to haul himself up to P7 – but a shock twist saw his lap deleted for exceeding track limits, leaving him down in P16, one spot ahead of Colapinto Piastri set the benchmark as the first laps came in, the Australian pumping in a 1m 40.626s to go just 0.089s clear of Norris, while Verstappen was some three-tenths off in third. Further back, Bearman had a moment after a big snap through Pouhon, forcing the Haas driver to abort his lap. With the opening efforts in, the names at risk were Hulkenberg, Bortoleto, Gasly, Sainz and Bearman – and, following a brief lull in the action, a queue of cars peeled out of the pit lane for their final runs of Q2, prompting a seemingly annoyed Piastri to comment: “Some people need bigger mirrors.” Gasly moved up to ninth, while Bortoleto went into an eye-catching eighth before an improvement from Lawson then put the Racing Bulls driver into that slot. Meanwhile Gasly was pushed down to 13th place, and a tough Qualifying left Hulkenberg down in 14th ahead of the Williams of Sainz in 15th. As the first laps went on the board, Piastri initially looked to have taken provisional pole ahead of Verstappen – only for Norris to storm through on an even quicker time, the Briton beating his team mate by 0.189s via his effort of 1m 40.562s. Verstappen – some half a second back in third – reported that he “just didn't have the same grip” in the Red Bull, while Leclerc had taken fourth ahead of Russell, Tsunoda, Lawson, Albon, Hadjar and Bortoleto. With the clock ticking down, all 10 cars headed out for their final grid-deciding runs. Leclerc moved up to third, pushing Verstappen down a place – but the question remained over whether Piastri could steal pole from Norris. It turned out that the Australian could not, with his improved lap ultimately not enough to beat Norris' previous time, meaning that the Briton would start from pole position. Tsunoda secured his best grid slot as a Red Bull driver in seventh, while the Racing Bulls of Hadjar and Lawson took eighth and ninth, with Bortoleto rounding out the top 10 for Kick Sauber. I don't know why everyone was pretty worried after yesterday. It was just a couple of little issues that we had. I was confident after yesterday and coming into today, so it's nice to see that I could get back to the top.” The 2025 Belgian Grand Prix is set to begin at 1500 local time on Sunday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ONBOARD: Lando Norris' 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the Belgian Grand Prix Oscar Piastri conceded that it was “a bit frustrating” to not be able to overtake Max Verstappen during the Sprint at the Belgian Grand Prix, while McLaren team mate Lando Norris admitted that the team may need to “reassess” prior to Qualifying later on Saturday. Asked afterwards if Lap 1 had played out as he expected, Piastri responded: “Pretty much, yeah. I tried my best to snake my way through the straights and not give too much of a tow, but I just didn't have enough straight-line speed, and then obviously, I didn't have enough straight-line speed for the next 15 laps either. “The weather is looking pretty bad tomorrow, which obviously means you don't want to take off too much wing, but I don't really want to repeat the Sprint we've just had. We'll have a look and see what we can do, but there are a lot of things to look into before tomorrow.” Despite being left disappointed by his result in the Sprint, Piastri is remaining optimistic about Qualifying later on Saturday. “Spa is my favourite track of the year, and especially in Qualifying, it's just mega around here. I'm looking forward to some more laps in anger.” Behind him, Piastri's team mate Norris had to settle for third place. After being overtaken by Ferrari's Charles Leclerc on Lap 1, the Briton later retook the place and tried to chase down Verstappen and Piastri up ahead. However, like Piastri, Norris was unable to make a move. “Maybe I could have positioned myself a little bit better, but otherwise, it was a bit too difficult to get past Max. “Obviously, I hoped for a bit of battling or something, but the Red Bull was too quick in the straight for us to catch up. Maybe some tweaks for us to make into Qualifying. Norris arrives into the weekend off the back of two consecutive victories in Austria and Great Britain and is still aiming to make it a hat-trick of wins on Sunday at Spa-Francorchamps. I was still comfortable, it's just a couple of things didn't go my way, but I'm still confident that we can have a good result later and finish with some good Quali laps.”</p>
