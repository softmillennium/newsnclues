                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leylah Fernandez emerged victorious in a gripping battle with Elena Rybakina Saturday to reach the Mubadala Citi DC Open final in Washington, D.C.And she did so after Rybakina served for the match in the second set, leading to a dramatic encounter lasting three hours and 16 minutes.On a day that produced little to separate the competitors, it was Fernandez who out-served the 2022 Wimbledon champion when it counted to secure the 6-7 (2), 7-6 (3), 7-6 (3) victory. And she did so after Rybakina served for the match in the second set, leading to a dramatic encounter lasting three hours and 16 minutes.On a day that produced little to separate the competitors, it was Fernandez who out-served the 2022 Wimbledon champion when it counted to secure the 6-7 (2), 7-6 (3), 7-6 (3) victory. The left-hander won 16 of her first 17 points on serve, but watched as Rybakina rocketed consecutive return winners in the opening tiebreak to swing the momentum in her favor. The Kazakh appeared to be in control by securing an immediate break to launch set two, but an inability to extend her lead to a double break despite chances in her next two return games—including 0-40 at 3-1—would later cost the No. Back in another now-or-never situation, the Canadian opened a 5-0 lead en route to trading tiebreaks on the scoreboard. Sensing Rybakina's tightness, Fernandez worked the energy of the crowd to her advantage to level for 5-5.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Luciano Darderi maintained his perfect record in ATP Tour finals on Saturday at the Plava Laguna Croatia Open Umag, where he downed Carlos Taberner 6-3, 6-3 to win his second title in as many weeks. The Italian triumphed at the ATP 250 in Bastad last week and backed that up in Umag, where he used his brutal baseline power to blast through the draw and become just the third man to win at least three tour-level titles this year, joining Carlos Alcaraz and Alexander Bublik, who also won his second consecutive trophy in Kitzbuehel on Saturday. "It is something special for me," Darderi said. I am very happy about the title. If you told me this two weeks ago, I'd say it was impossible. But I am very happy with my performance and my tennis was incredible this week. I will try to rest now and continue to play like this in the next week on hard courts." In the final game of the match, Darderi seemed to roll his ankle when he brought up match point. Unable to walk properly, Taberner demonstrated great sportsmanship to help the second seed to his feet, with Darderi then receiving treatment on his ankle ahead of the trophy ceremony. Darderi, a four-time tour-level champion, is up 11 spots to No. 59, but has climbed to within three spots of his career high No. 32 after winning nine consecutive matches across Bastad and Umag. Darderi struck 20 winners to 17 unforced errors and a forehand winner at 3-2 in the first set was enough to earn him the crucial break in the first set. Taberner upset top seed Francisco Cerundolo en route to his maiden tour-level final. The Spaniard leaves Croatia up 27 spots at No. 84 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and is set to rise to a career high on Monday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alcaraz and Sinner played out another classic in the final of Wimbledon earlier this month, following their five-set thriller at Roland Garros, which lasted five hours and 29 minutes. The two have split the last seven major titles between them, and look set to dominate men's tennis for years to come. However, former US Open champion Dominic Thiem thinks there are four players who can stop the ‘new two' at Flushing Meadows in September. In an interview with ‘Cronache di Tennis‘, Thiem said: “The finals at Roland Garros and Wimbledon were incredible. They raised the bar of this sport beyond what we were used to. I didn't expect two more generational talents to arrive so quickly after the Big Three. Then they, too, can lose: we saw it with Grigor Dimitrov at Wimbledon, or even Alexander Zverev, Taylor Fritz, and Jack Draper, if they play perfectly. “I doubt they'll win every Slam in the next 10 years, but today they're one step ahead of everyone. “I would have liked to play against Alcaraz and Sinner in my prime. In 2025 so far, Alcaraz has played 54 matches on the ATP Tour and has lost just six of them. After losing to the Spaniard again in the Roland Garros final, his most recent defeat was to Alexander Bublik in Halle.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bianca Andreescu returns to Canada and is welcomed by a tough draw which includes an opening round contest against Barbora Krejcikova. The Canadian will face the former Wimbledon champion in a blockbuster opening round match which both players will feel they need to win. Andreeva could face another Canadian in the form of Leylah Fernandez in the third round before a fourth round match against Daria Kasatkina. The potential quarter-final for Andreeva could be either Elena Rybakina or Emma Navarro, who could face Rebecca Marino in the first round. Top seed Coco Gauff could face Danielle Collins to begin her campaign with potentially Sofia Kenin awaiting in the last 16. However, Kenin could face Canadian rising star Victoria Mboko in her opening round contest. Pegula won Toronto last year and will be hoping to match her form from last year's North American hard court swing. The American could face compatriot Amanda Anisimova in the quarter-finals as Anisimova aims to overcome her Wimbledon final humiliation with a win against either Lulu Sun or Sorana Cirstea. Other storylines are Madison Keys' potential second round contest with Tatjana Maria while Genie Bouchard plays the final tournament of her career and will begin against Emiliana Arango with Belinda Bencic awaiting in the second round. Finally, Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek will begin her campaign against Yulia Putintseva or a qualifier with Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Clara Tauson also in her section of the draw.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Canadian tennis player Vasek Pospisil is set to retire at the National Bank Open at age 35, his father Milos can't pick one favourite memory from his son's career. Maybe it was trekking to tournaments together in a small Winnebago, seeing him win a Wimbledon doubles title, or watching him upset then World No.1 Andy Murray at Indian Wells. But it's hard to top the feeling of seeing his son represent Canada in Davis Cup and help the country win its first title in 2022. “That was such a big deal for us as immigrants from former Czechoslovakia, to give something back,” said Milos Pospisil, who had coached his son until age 20. Milos and his wife Mila are in Toronto this weekend to watch their son play his final tournament, along with other family and friends. Pospisil sifts through a lifetime of tennis memories. They found clever ways to save money in an expensive sport over the years. When in North America, they got a small diesel Winnebago to travel everywhere from California to Florida, stopping at rest areas along the U.S. freeways. They drove through cold places too, and the heat would sometimes conk out. “I have incredible memories with my dad,” said Pospisil. Pospisil blows kisses to the crowd after losing to Milos Raonic during semi-final play at the Rogers Cup tennis tournament in August 2013.The Canadian Press During his 18-year career on the ATP Tour, Pospisil reached a career-high No. Pospisil helped provide one of the most memorable moments in recent Canadian Open history when he reached the semi-finals as a qualifier in Montreal in 2013 and lost an all-Canadian showdown to Milos Raonic. In doubles, he won Wimbledon alongside American teammate Jack Sock in 2014 – a duo known as ‘The Pop-Socks.” He was the doubles No. He'd begun as a 17-year-old who idolized Canadian doubles star Daniel Nestor and got to team up with him several times. His last tie for Canada was earlier this year in Montreal, where he partnered with Davis Cup rookie Liam Draxl. Felix Auger-Aliassime, who played a key role in Canada's Davis Cup title, says it was fun to see Pospisil celebrating it. “I was so happy to play my part, because he deserved it for how much he's given to Team Canada,” said Auger-Aliassime. “I mean, playing ties all over the world. .me watching that as a kid inspired me to one day play for the team.” Pospisil also made his mark as an advocate for players' rights, joining Novak Djokovic in founding the first-ever Professional Tennis Players Association in 2019. Earlier this year, along with the PTPA, he filed an antitrust lawsuit against the main governing bodies of professional tennis. While he doesn't regret for a minute spending his energy on the PTPA work, he admits it distracted from his work on the court in recent years. “Going from someone that was very popular amongst the establishment at all these tournaments to suddenly being extremely unpopular was tough,” he said. Each attempted comeback seemed to hit a roadblock. As for what's next, Pospisil says he'll pursue his interests in business. He's enjoyed helping raise money for a VC fund in the U.S. during recent years. He's keen to help with any Davis Cup duties, should Tennis Canada ask him. “Nothing would make me happier than to help young juniors in less privileged positions,” he said. “I learned through years of trial and error, so if I can help expedite the learning curve for somebody who is a good person, or two or three or more players, then I would find that fulfilling.” “We're gonna miss seeing him competing in the big tournaments,” said his father. “But I'm also quite excited about seeing him go through his next chapter of life.” Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following. © Copyright 2025 The Globe and Mail Inc.

Royal fans were delighted when Kate Middleton attended Wimbledon solo on July 12 to watch the women's singles final. For the occasion, Princess Kate wore a white Self-Portrait dress, which she accessorized with an Anya Hindmarch tote bag and Gianvito Rossi suede pumps. Now, a royal source has revealed how the Princess of Wales felt when she received a standing ovation after arriving at Wimbledon. Speaking to Us Weekly, a royal source said of the moment, "[Kate] felt really good, and it reinforced her recovery and that everyone is rooting for her." As the royal patron of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, and an enthusiastic tennis fan, Princess Kate is a regular attendee at Wimbledon. The Princess of Wales even made an unexpected appearance at the sporting event in 2024, while undergoing preventative chemotherapy treatment following a cancer diagnosis. As a result, it's completely understandable that the crowd celebrated Princess Kate's return to the tournament, and her recovery from cancer, by giving her a standing ovation. Princess Kate receives a standing ovation at Wimbledon on July 12. The Princess of Wales returned to Wimbledon on July 13 with husband Prince William, and two of their three children—Prince George and Princess Charlotte. For her second 2025 appearance at Wimbledon, Kate wore a royal blue V-neck dress, which she paired with her wide-brimmed, ribbon-trimmed hat from L.K. Bennett—an item beloved by Marie Claire's senior royal editor, Kristin Contino. Unfortunately, Kate's exact hat has since sold out, but similar items remain available for anyone hoping to replicate her regal style. A pair of $750 Ralph Lauren Collection Celia Calfskin Pumps and Cartier's $3,350 18K Pink Yellow White Gold Classic Trinity Hoop Earrings accessorized the Princess of Wales's summery outfit.

Coming into the contest on the back of 16 wins from his last 18 matches on Tour, Bublik produced another assured display on the Austrian clay, beating Cazaux 6-4, 6-3 in just 86 minutes.

The 28-year-old won 84% of points behind his first serve, overpowering his opponent with 26 winners across the two sets.

It continues a remarkable resurgence for Bublik, who has already claimed silverware in Halle and Gstaad this summer, as well as reaching the last eight at Roland Garros.

"I can't believe I did it as it was probably one of the toughest weeks in my life because coming from Gstaad, playing here, different conditions and raining," Bublik said in his on-court interview.

"I am pleased I got through and thank you for supporting me throughout the tournament."

The Kazakh will be keen to carry his momentum into the American hard-court swing, as he looks to climb into the top 20 and surpass his career-high ranking of world number 17.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Their battle in Paris was electrifying from all points of view and is destined to remain a feat in the memory of fans, not only because it was the longest final in the history of the French Slam. The 23-year-old Italian was really one step away from the feat and had three match points in a row in the fourth set, but his top rival did not give up and prevailed in the fifth set after almost five and a half hours. The world number 1 took revenge over the 22-year-old Spaniard in the Wimbledon final a couple of weeks ago, proving to be superior despite losing the first set in a rather mocking way. The hope of fans around the world is that there will be a new chapter in this amazing rivalry already at the US Open at the end of the summer, with Jannik who will be called upon to defend the title won in New York a year ago. The Big Apple also evokes good memories in the mind of Carlos, who won the first Grand Slam title of his young career right there in 2022. In that edition, the ace from Murcia defeated Sinner at the end of an epic clash in the quarterfinals. In an interview with 'TRM', former ATP ace and current coach Renzo Furlan discussed the rivalry between Sinner and Alcaraz: "Both are eager to improve and push themselves to the limit, as always happens when there is such an important rivalry. There is no doubt that these two players are several steps above the others right now and – if there are no surprises – they will be the benchmarks of men's tennis in the coming years as well. It is not excluded that there may be the rise of some other player like Lorenzo Musetti or Ben Shelton."

The first half of the 2025 season gave Carlos Alcaraz five titles – in Rotterdam, Monte Carlo, Rome, Roland Garros and Queen's respectively – while he missed out on his third win in a row at the Wimbledon Championships due to a deluxe version of Jannik Sinner, who defeated him on the iconic Centre Court to become the first Italian ever to win the world's most famous tournament.

The 22-year-old Spaniard can be very satisfied with how he reacted to the difficulties of the beginning of the year, when he was unable to express his best tennis and had also had a small crisis after the shocking elimination against David Goffin in the second round of the Miami Open.

The five-time Grand Slam champion has made no secret of the fact that he will give his best in the second half of 2025 to return to the top of the ATP rankings, knowing that his top rival Sinner will have to defend many more points than him from Cincinnati onwards.

Both Carlos and Jannik will skip the Toronto Masters 1000 which begins next week and will return to action directly in Ohio, where Alcaraz's run in 2024 had already ended in the second round due to the fatigue accumulated at the Paris Olympics.

Like all the other top players, the champion from Murcia also took a little vacation after the Championships and recently returned to practice at the 'La Manga Club'.

The world number 2 knows that he has to change something from the past, as his level dropped significantly in the second half of the year in both 2023 and 2024. After winning his second Wimbledon title last season, Carlitos has not expressed his best level and has only triumphed at the Beijing ATP 500 by beating Sinner in an epic final.

It's no secret that the Spanish star's main goal is the US Open, which kicks off on August 24 in New York.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Karsten Braasch is one of tennis' most recognisable players The German never made any huge inroads in the sport but his unorthodox serve, the goggles he wore on court and his tendency to smoke in changeovers made him an unforgettable figure. The now 58-year-old has a career-high ranking of No. 38 in the world but never made the second week of a Grand Slam or won a title. Braasch's notoriety in the sport would end up coming not in an official match but during an exhibition. Serena and Venus Williams are widely considered as some of tennis' most successful ever players. Right from their debuts, the pair were seen as generational talents, a hype they lived up to with Serena ending her career with 23 Grand Slam titles and Venus with seven. As a result of their dominance, many had raised the question as to whether they could compete with men. Venus, who recently secured a tour win aged 45, and Serena had also both claimed that they could likely beat any man ranked outside the top 200. So in 1998, that opportunity came when the pair took part in a Battle of Sexes exhibition at the Australian Open. Braasch had also made headlines as he played the two matches after finishing a round of golf and drinking two shandies. There have been several Battles of the Sexes -- exhibition matches played between a man and a woman or a doubles match between two men and two women. In October 2013, Novak Djokovic and Li Na played a light-hearted five game mini set in Bejjing, China to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the China Open. The Serbian had even swapped places with ballboy at one point. At the Open de Tennis de Bourg-de-Péage in France in December 2023, the final of the women's draw was due to be played between Donna Vekic and Mirra Andreeva. Vekic withdrew with injury and Ukrainian Marta Kostyuk agreed to replace her, but withdrew as a result of the backlash of facing a Russian.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brad Gilbert has rubbished reports that Jannik Sinner's coach Darren Cahill will not be working with the Italian at the 2025 US Open. On Friday, Italian newspaper la Repubblica reported that Simone Vagnozzi would be Sinner's only coach at the New York Grand Slam as they claimed Cahill will take “a short break.” Sinner has been coached by former Italian player Vagnozzi since February 2022, while Cahill joined the team in July 2022. Gilbert, a former coach of Andre Agassi, Andy Roddick and Coco Gauff, works alongside Cahill as an analyst and commentator for ESPN. In reply to a Twitter post sharing the claim that Cahill will miss the US Open, Gilbert made it clear that he expects the Australian to be at Flushing Meadows. Jannik Sinner's coaching surprise ahead of US Open Jannik Sinner claimed to have ‘wanted' controversial fitness trainer back despite doping row However, Cahill has not fully closed the door on continuing his partnership with Sinner. Italian newspaper Il Corriere della Sera claimed after Sinner's Wimbledon triumph earlier this month that Cahill will remain on the Italian's team in 2026. “It depends on whether I want to tell the truth or not,” Sinner said. Someone who gives me so much, not just on the tennis court, but in life outside of it, about how to live both in victories and disappointments. If I choose to stay with him, he probably won't travel so much anymore. But I've always said, back in Australia, that I'd like to have him, because things are going well. Asked this week by the ATP Tour whether Cahill will stay, Vagnozzi said: “Honestly, nothing's certain at the moment. But we'll all be happy if Darren stays.” READ NEXT: Jannik Sinner U-turn called ‘one of the most astonishing PR moves in tennis history' "I didn't expect two more generational talents to come so quickly after the Big Three." Jannik Sinner will only have one coach in his player's box at the US Open. Rybakina could do battle with fellow Grand Slam winners Sinner and Alcaraz in New York.</p>

The 22-year-old Dane missed out on a place in the semi-finals when she lost 3-6, 5-7 to Russian outsider Anna Kalinskaya on Saturday night.

As the fourth seed in the tournament, Tauson went into the game as favorite against Kalinskaya, who is four years her senior and ranked No 48 in the world while Tauson is ranked 19th.  

Tauson quickly fell behind in the first set, where she was broken three times in her own serve.

In the second set, Tauson still couldn't get her game going against the strong Kalinskaya, and the Dane trailed 3-5 after a new Russian service breakthrough.

In the next game, the Dane broke to 4-5, and a little later she also equalized to 5-5 giving her hope of a possible comeback, but it was quickly extinguished.

On the other side of the net, Kalinskaya got hold of herself and the Russian won the next two games to close out the match.</p>
