                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The global soccer players' union hit back at FIFA and its president Gianni Infantino on Friday, saying their autocratic style of leadership was harming the rights of its members. “Football needs responsible leadership, not emperors,” the FIFPRO network said after a meeting of 58 national player unions responded to FIFA pursuing its agenda with unofficial player representatives. FIFA announced two weeks ago it reached a consensus on key issues after Infantino hosted a group of mostly non-recognized officials in New York ahead of the Club World Cup final. Get top local stories delivered to you every morning with NBC DFW's News Headlines newsletter. FIFA denounced what it called Friday the union leadership's “increasingly divisive and contradictory tone" in pursuing a public relations battle "to preserve their own personal positions and interests." FIFPRO said Friday its core concerns included an overloaded global match calendar with too many games for elite players, lack of physical and mental recovery periods and extreme playing conditions. The tournament, FIFPRO said, was “celebrated by President Infantino despite being held under conditions that were extreme and inappropriate for any human being, demonstrating a troubling insensitivity to human rights, even when it concerns elite athletes. FIFA responded by challenging the union to publish its statutes and “transparent annual accounts.” “Let us be clear: you cannot preach transparency while operating in opacity,” the world soccer body said. FIFPRO has not had a formal working agreement with FIFA since the previous one expired in 2023.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MEXICO CITY, Mexico (July 26, 2025) – The U.S. U-17 Women's National Team opened the 4 Nations Tournament with a 1-1  draw with Canada as outside back Sydney Schmidt equalized with a header off a corner kick in the 88th minute. Tournament regulations stipulate that each team earns one point for a draw, followed by a penalty kick shootout, with the winner earning an additional point in this round-robin tournament, which also features host Mexico and Costa Rica. The USA went first in the shootout, and Schmidt made it two goals in a matter of minutes when she led with a powerful conversion. Forward Lauren Malsom, midfielder Scottie Antonucci (whose shot was touched by the goalkeeper but hit the post and rolled over the line), and team captain and central defender PearlCecil then all coolly finished their spot kicks. On Canada's fourth attempt, Olivia Chisholm squared off with U.S. goalkeeper Peyton Trayer but skied her shot way over the bar. The USA will next face Costa Rica on July 29 (9 a.m. MT / 11 a.m. The second half was an entirely different story as the USA kept Canada pinned in its half with a combination of quick passing through the midfield, pressing defense and some dangerous flank play. With stellar performances from second-half subs Antonucci, Loradana Paletta, Touray, Anastasia Showler-Little, Malsom and Elayna Kocher putting intense attacking pressure on Canada, the USA earned a corner kick from the right side in the 88th minute. Antonucci served a perfect cross to the far post, where Schmidt, who played both left and right back in the game, crashed through traffic to hammer home a header from close range. It was Schmidt's first international goal in her fifth U-17 cap. Mexico won that shootout, 4-1, to earn an additional point, meaning the USA and Mexico are tied atop the 4 Nations Tournament standings with two points each. Canada and Costa Rica each have one point, making the second matchday on Tuesday, July 29, vital towards the tournament title. Mexico, with two goals scored to the USA's one, is currently in first place via that tiebreaker. The tournament is serving as important World Cup preparation for all teams as each will be competing in the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup later this fall in Morocco.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For any player looking to make a significant contribution at the 2026 FIFA World Cup, playing regular minutes and being in form is a must. While many of the U.S. men's national team players have sorted out their club situations or are already key contributors, the same can't be said for Matt Turner, who seems to have lost his grasp on the starting goalkeeper role under head coach Mauricio Pochettino. Now, after nearly securing a move to Lyon in France's Ligue 1, he might be out of luck. While the club were keen to bring him in as a replacement for Lucas Perri, their financial situation has proven problematic, and they have taken on legal help to cancel the transfer worth a reported $9.4 million. First, he has to sort out which club he belongs to, and at the same time, navigate the right path towards consistent playing time at a high level, to keep his place on the USMNT. The most straightforward and primary option for Turner would be that Lyon complete the transfer from Nottingham Forest, regardless of their current financial situation. From Turner's perspective, it would allow him to be a top-choice goalkeeper in Europe for the first time, replacing Perri, who recently joined Premier League side Leeds United. When Turner moved from Forest to Crystal Palace on loan, the hope was that he may be able to get a few more minutes and battle for a key role. Yet, he never challenged Dean Henderson for the starting spot, and faded into the background of Palace's plans, even as USMNT teammate Chris Richards thrived at center back. Leaving Europe might not entice many, but it could be the right path for Turner, after his so-far unsuccessful foray into UEFA. Previously, he was a star with the New England Revolution, and would likely slide right into a starting role if he were to return to that club. Other potential clubs that could look at a new starting goalkeeper include the San Jose Earthquakes, Atlanta United and D.C. United, with others having the potential to open up a spot should they view Turner, who has expressed his openness to an MLS return, as an option. Turner's struggles in England aren't the first time for an American goalkeeper, and a return to MLS could match a similar path to Zack Steffen, who failed to crack regular minutes with Manchester City before returning to MLS as a star goalkeeper with the Colorado Rapids.

Abou Ali has signed a contract until 2027 with an option for 2028. “Wessam is a special player whose journey speaks to his resilience, character, and tireless work ethic, which are qualities we value at our Club,” Columbus Crew general manager Issa Tell said in a club statement. “He is a proven goal-scorer who knows what it takes to help his team win.

There, he scored 38 goals and provided ten assists in 60 games across all competitions. Columbus Crew sign forward with great free kick ability What sort of player is Abou Ali? “For years, Al Ahly struggled with set pieces, but Abou Ali solved that with his excellent free kick abilities, scoring important goals in the CAF Champions League and Egyptian Premier League. There is no doubt that Wessam is a top star for Al Ahly, winning the Egyptian Premier League top scorer award within six months of joining the club, scoring 18 goals and providing six assists in just 19 games. Last year, he missed some time with an injury but came back in top form.” With all that in mind, it isn't surprising that Abou Ali has become a significant star both in Palestine and Egypt. Indeed, Al Ahly fought hard to keep the player, and it took a player strike on Abou Ali's part to facilitate the transfer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alex Phillips was speaking after FIFPro held a meeting in Amsterdam with 58 national player unions from around the world to discuss concerns over the way the sport's world governing body FIFA is managing global football. "Before the Club World Cup, I was speaking to some of the top stars and they were saying they hadn't had a rest for 'X' amount of time," Phillips said. Others were resigned actually, and cynical about speaking up. "Then you see some of the same players two weeks later having to record social media videos saying 'We think the Club World Cup is great,' because their employers are telling them to do it. "You have this contradictory situation where players can't speak up. They can speak up but it might have consequences." "It is unacceptable for an organisation that claims global leadership to turn a blind eye to the basic needs of the players," FIFPro said in a statement, notably citing the "overloaded" match calendar, heat concerns at the Club World Cup and an "ongoing disregard for players' social rights". FIFPro Europe filed a complaint to the European Commission last year accusing FIFA of abusing its position with regards to its handling of the international match calendar. FIFA hit back at FIFPro in a statement on Friday as it called for dialogue "with legitimate bodies that put player welfare first" and said it had tried unsuccessfully to get the union to attend its meeting in New York on July 12. "This approach clearly shows that rather than engaging in constructive dialogue, FIFPRO has chosen to pursue a path of public confrontation," which aims to preserve "their own personal positions and interests."</p>

At the club level, the midfield engine has racked up nearly 500 appearances across all competitions and tallied 57 goals and 74 assists, representing Racing Club in his native Argentina (2012-2014, 2016 on loan) before an accomplished spell in Europe, playing for Valencia CF (2014-2016), Udinese (2016-2021) and Club Atlético de Madrid (2021-2025). The versatile midfielder has also earned various individual accolades throughout his successful career. The Sarandí, Buenos Aires, Argentina native began his career in the youth ranks at Racing Club prior to being promoted to the first team and making his professional debut in February 2013. De Paul went on to establish himself as a key player for Racing over the next seasons before embarking on a new chapter in European fútbol in 2014. First, he played 44 matches and recorded two goals and four assists in two seasons for historic Spanish side Valencia, before making a move to Italian Serie A side Udinese. The midfielder flourished as a leader in his five seasons in Italy, donning the captain's armband for I Bianconeri, making 184 total appearances across all competitions, scoring 34 goals and dishing out 37 assists. Additionally, during his two spells in Spain, he faced current Inter Miami head coach Javier Mascherano, defender Jordi Alba, midfielder Sergio Busquets, Messi, and Suárez on multiple occasions in their days as FC Barcelona players. On the international stage, De Paul made his debut for Argentina's national team in 2018 and has gone on to earn 78 caps, scoring two times, in a fruitful era for La Albiceleste. In that span, De Paul and Inter Miami captain Messi have shared the pitch a total of 62 times for their country's senior side.</p>
