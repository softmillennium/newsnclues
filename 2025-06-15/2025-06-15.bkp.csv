            Fear has been gripping Iranians as Israel vows to continue attacking the Islamic Republic over its nuclear program, with many fleeing the bigger cities, including the capital Tehran, in search of safer areas.
    


            A resident of Saadat Abad, a wealthy neighborhood in north Tehran which has been hit in Israel's strikes, told CNN they heard explosions all night, some so powerful that it shook their entire apartment building. Like other people in Iran who spoke with CNN, the resident asked to remain anonymous out of concern for their safety.
    


            There was chaos as residents ran down to the ground level after smelling smoke from a nearby building that had also been targeted, the resident said. Families with young children struggled to keep them calm.
    


            Unlike Israel, Iran's capital Tehran doesn't have modern bomb shelters, so the city must make use of tunnels, basements or older shelters used in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s – the last time the country faced such a grave national emergency.
    


            “In Tehran there weren't any shelters, people went into basements,” the chairman of Tehran's City Council, Mehdi Chamran, told reporters Sunday, adding that the metro can be used as a shelter “in extreme crisis” but that “we would need to shut the system down.”
    


            The metro in Tehran will be open 24 hours a day starting Sunday night for people to shelter, a government spokesperson announced. Schools and mosques will also be open, she said.
    


            Older people in the building in Saadat Abad were comparing the fear-filled atmosphere to the eight-year-long war with Iraq, which saw Iraqi armed forces invading western Iran along the countries' joint border, the resident said.

Israel ‘not pausing for a moment' as fresh blasts rock Tehran



            Iranian experts have said that by attacking residential areas in Iran, Israel has “crossed the Rubicon” – or passed the point of no return – and is inviting attacks of the same kind from Tehran.
    


            “We don't support the Iranian regime, but we are against Israel attacking residential areas and civilians,” said an older male Tehran resident. “If Israel is against Iran's nuclear program and military capabilities, they should target those areas and not create another situation like what is happening in Gaza.”
    


            Israel has destroyed swathes of the Palestinian territory and displaced almost all of Gaza's population in its war against Hamas, an Iranian ally.
    


            For those still in Tehran, daily life carries on for now despite fears of a widening war. Shelves in grocery stores are stocked and previously arranged gatherings go ahead, but the drumbeat of conflict is never too far off. For those with cars, there are long lines to buy gas and purchases are capped at 25 liters, residents told CNN. Cashpoints are working but at some the amount of cash that can be withdrawn has been limited.
    


            Many of those quitting the capital are heading towards the north, near the Caspian Sea, an area which is more rural and isolated. But residents told CNN that the roads are so gridlocked it is difficult to move.
    


            One family, who didn't want to be named, decided to leave Tehran with their two small children and their elderly parents. They are worried that the government has housed officials and military leaders within highly populated, upper middle-class neighborhoods – putting civilians at risk.
    


            “I don't want to leave my home, but I am not going to put my young children in this position,” the father said. “I hope that the US steps in to stop the attacks between both countries.”

Israel's strikes zeroed in on Iran's nuclear program. How much damage was done?



            In the city of Shiraz, in south-central Iran, long lines for gas have been forming around the city. Residents are also stocking up on food, water, and diapers.
    


            Cars full of families with suitcases and water strapped to the roof have been seen around the city, with many families leaving for the countryside.
    


            Meanwhile, nights have become very quiet in Tehran, residents said. Many shops are closed and many people have either left the city or are too scared to go to work, they said.
    


            Israel's operation against Iran is expected to take “weeks, not days” and is moving forward with implicit US approval, according to White House and Israeli officials. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to “strike every site and every target of the Ayatollah's regime,” referring to the country's Supreme Leader.
    


            The Israeli military on Sunday also issued an “urgent” evacuation warning to Iranians living near weapons production facilities, saying being nearby would endanger their lives.
    


            In a rare direct address to the people of Iran, Netanyahu on Friday urged its citizens to “stand up and let your voices be heard,” after Israel unleashed deadly strikes on its regional foe.
    


            “The time has come for the Iranian people to unite around its flag and its historic legacy, by standing up for your freedom from an evil and oppressive regime,” Netanyahu said in a statement.
    


            The Iranian regime remains unpopular at home, where security forces continue their brutal crackdown on dissidents. Nonetheless, the Israeli leader's call fell on deaf ears.

            Many of those with whom CNN spoke did not want to be quoted, even anonymously, but none expressed any support for Netanyahu's calls for a revolt.
    


            “Israel is underestimating our love for our country; the idea that bombing us, our homes, killing our children, would send us to the streets is shocking. We want to live peacefully whether we like the regime or not,” a 36-year-old man who wished to remain anonymous told CNN.
    


            Some Iranians expressed anger and asserted they would never cede to Netanyahu's demands.
    


            “Do I wish the regime wasn't in power? Absolutely. Do I want my city bombed by another dictator? Absolutely not,” Neda, a 28-year-old woman, told CNN.
    


            “Don't let the fake news fool you, the reality of what is happening in Iran as an Iranian who has actually lived in Iran, who has their family in Iran, (is that) Israel is in no way helping our people. I don't need fake news and propaganda speeches,” she added.
    


            Iran has threatened to intensify its own retaliatory attacks if Israel continues hostilities.
    


            Over 200 rocket launches from Iran were reported overnight into Sunday, the Israeli government said, and at least 13 people have been killed in Israel, including three children.
    


            Unofficial tallies published by Iran's state affiliated media said dozens in the country have been killed and injured in Israeli strikes. Iran's authorities have yet to declare a death toll.

Follow:


            There are few patriarchs within the teen film genre like Mel Horowitz in “Clueless.”
    


            The straight-talking litigator portrayed by Dan Hedaya terrifies everyone in his path – with the exception of his daughter Cher, played by Alicia Silverstone in the beloved 1995 film. He's a man of multitudes. Direct and assertive, yet attentive and loving.
    


            The heavily New York–accented Mel is an outlier to the breezy Beverly Hills setting of the movie. Although “Clueless” is loosely based on Jane Austen's 1815 novel “Emma,” the film's director Amy Heckerling drew on a range of influences outside of Emma's father, the charming Mr. Woodhouse.
    


            “I suppose the main inspiration for Mel was my father – an angry accountant. He was always yelling about one thing or another,” Heckerling recently told CNN over email. “I never seemed to figure out how to diffuse his anger, unless we were driving and I'd stick in a Benny Goodman or Mills Brothers tape.”
    


            Heckerling continued to build Mel, taking cues from detective and gangster archetypes, looking for an actor who would be normally cast in such roles – like “Law & Order” star Jerry Orbach or Quentin Tarantino fixture Harvey Keitel. Both were approached, but prior filming commitments and a strict budget for “Clueless” kept either from landing the role. Hedaya came into the picture via a recommendation from a friend of Heckerling.
    


            “He looked like he could play Bob Shapiro, the famous litigator working on the O.J. trial. I was so happy we were able to get him,” she said of casting the character actor, whose other credits include 1996's “The First Wives Club” and playing Richard Nixon in “Dick” in 1999.
    


            In “Clueless,” although Cher is Mel's only biological child, he opens his home to his college-aged stepson Josh, played by Paul Rudd. Mel “treats him like a son,” according to Heckerling. Studying law, Josh spends an inordinate amount of time at the Horowitz mansion, aiding Mel in his legal cases and referring to him as “dad,” much to Cher's chagrin. But in Mel's words, “You divorce wives, not children.”
    


            While other characters who encounter Mel appear to find him scary, “Cher only sees lovable daddy,” Heckerling observed. Cher possesses the ability to stay positive and calm in the face of her dad's fury, which is something Heckerling learned when dealing with her own father: “If anger is coming at you, it doesn't mean you have to let it in.”
    


            In a touching scene toward the film's climax, Mel lists Cher's personal achievements, mentioning that her organizational skills and caring nature reminds him of Cher's dearly departed mother. Although Mel is seen as tough, he's also fair. His ability to verbalize praise sets him apart from fathers in similar features at the time, such as the overbearing Walter in “10 Things I Hate About You” (Lary Miller), rigid Harlan in “She's All That” (Tim Matheson) and the legacy-obsessed Sam in “Varsity Blues” (Thomas F. Duffy).
    


Just make sure you don't sit in Mel's chair.

West Jerusalem has asked the White House to take part in its military campaign against Iran in order to eliminate Tehran's nuclear program, according to two Israeli officials cited by Axios.



Several above-ground facilities in Iran, including sites in Natanz and Esfahan, were destroyed in recent Israeli strikes, according to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director-General Rafael Grossi.



Israel described the operation as a preemptive move to prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon – Iran has consistently denied that it has any intention to do so.



Grossi said the Iranian government had also informed him that the Fordow enrichment plant near the city of Qom, a heavily fortified site built deep inside a mountain, was targeted, but there are no indications that the site sustained significant damage.



According to Axios, Israel lacks the bunker-busting bombs and long-range bomber aircraft required to destroy Fordow. The US, however, possesses both and operates forces within range of Iran.

Israeli officials reportedly believe that if Fordow remains operational after the operation ends, West Jerusalem's mission to eliminate Iran's nuclear program will have failed.



An Israeli official told Axios the US might participate in the campaign and said President Donald Trump had indicated during a recent call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he would consider it “if necessary.” The White House has denied this claim.



A second American official confirmed that Israel had requested US involvement but said the Trump administration is not considering it.

Washington has reportedly distanced itself from the operation, while warning that even a limited strike could draw the US into the war. White House officials have argued that it would be illegitimate for Iran to retaliate against American forces.

A senior US official told the outlet that while the Israeli attacks could not be prevented, a peaceful resolution remains possible. “We have the ability to negotiate a successful, peaceful resolution to this conflict if Iran is willing,” the source said. “The fastest way for Iran to accomplish peace is to give up its nuclear weapons program.”



Nuclear talks between Tehran and Washington began in April, with Trump warning of military consequences if diplomacy failed.



On Saturday, Tehran cancelled a sixth round of negotiations scheduled in Oman. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said talks would not resume until Israeli strikes come to an end.



Earlier on Saturday, Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart held a 50-minute phone call to discuss the situation in the Middle East. The two leaders reportedly agreed on the possibility of restarting negotiations over Iran's nuclear program.

Tehran will limit its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) over what it has called the organization's “silence” regarding Israeli strikes, according to Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi.

Israeli jets bombed nuclear and military facilities in Iran on Friday morning in what West Jerusalem described as an operation to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.

Iran, which denies having a military nuclear program, responded by saying the bombing was tantamount to a declaration of war and launched its own strikes against Israel. Tehran also suspended nuclear negotiations with the US; the next round had originally been scheduled for Sunday.

“We have decided that, from now on, we will no longer announce the details of our nuclear activities to the Agency in advance. This is part of a review of the level of our cooperation, which will no longer be the same as before,” Gharibabadi told SNN on Saturday.

“We have always maintained the most transparent peaceful nuclear program, but when the Agency and its Board of Governors remain silent in the face of Israeli aggression or issue resolutions influenced by political pressure, we can no longer maintain the same level of cooperation,” he added.

Without directly blaming Israel, the IAEA released a statement on Friday stressing that attacks on civilian nuclear sites are illegal under international law and called for dialogue.

The international watchdog had previously reported finding uranium traces at locations Iran had not declared as nuclear sites and, on Thursday, formally accused the Islamic Republic of breaching its non-proliferation obligations. Tehran has rejected the allegations as politically motivated.

The conflict between Israel and Iran could benefit Russia by pushing up global oil prices and drawing international attention away from Ukraine, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda has claimed.



On Friday morning, Israeli jets bombed military and nuclear sites across Iran, kicking off an ongoing exchange of hostilities between the two countries.



Speaking to reporters at the parliament building in Vilnius on Saturday, Nauseda argued that the Russian economy relies on “the damn petrodollars” and warned that rising energy prices could blunt the impact of EU sanctions.



“You get to live off every dollar when oil prices rise – so, unfortunately, it's Russia that benefits,” he said.



“And sometimes you wonder whether those sanctions packages we debate for days and proudly adopt are ultimately undermined by the fact that oil prices are now much higher than before the conflict,” Nauseda added.

The president further warned that the new hostilities in the Middle East are “at least somewhat overshadowing the war in Ukraine.”



Lithuania, a member of both NATO and the EU, has been among Ukraine's staunchest supporters, providing military aid and backing multiple rounds of sanctions against Moscow.



Prime Minister Gintautas Paluckas echoed Nauseda's concerns, cautioning that the fighting between Israel and Iran could “influence the political will” of the EU to keep pressuring Russia's energy sector.



According to CNN, the price of US crude oil and Brent surged 7% on Friday after Iran retaliated against Israel.

Former French president loses country's highest state award despite Emmanuel Macron's opposition to move

The former French president Nicolas Sarkozy has been stripped of his Legion of Honour, the country's highest distinction, after his conviction for corruption was confirmed last year, according to an official decree published on Sunday.

The conservative one-term president has been beset by legal problems since leaving office in 2012. In December France's highest court upheld his conviction for influence peddling and corruption, ordering him to wear an electronic ankle tag for 12 months.

Sarkozy, who remains an important figure in French politics, had been found guilty by a lower court in 2021 of trying to bribe a judge and peddling influence in exchange for confidential information about an investigation into his 2007 campaign finances.

Sarkozy, whose electronic tag was removed this month, has taken the case to the European court of human rights for appeal. His lawyer, Patrice Spinosi, said he had taken note of the award's revocation but stressed that the appeal was still pending.

An eventual ECHR ruling against France would “imply reviewing the criminal conviction against [Sarkozy], as well as his exclusion from the order of the Legion of Honour”, Spinosi said on Sunday.

Emmanuel Macron argued against the decision, but the rules of France's top state award stipulate that any recipient definitively sentenced to a term in prison equal to or greater than a year will be excluded from the order.

The French president, who is known to meet Sarkozy regularly, had argued that his predecessor had been elected to the country's highest office and it was “very important that former presidents are respected”.

The only previous former president to have had his Legion of Honour revoked was the Nazi collaborator Philippe Pétain, the head of France's wartime Vichy regime, who was convicted in August 1945 of high treason and conspiring with the enemy.

Others to have been stripped of the honour include the former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, the seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong, who was found to have used performance-enhancing drugs, and the film producer Harvey Weinstein, convicted of sexual abuse against women.

Sarkozy's legal woes are not yet over. He has been convicted of illegal campaign financing in his failed 2012 re-election bid, and is currently on trial on charges of accepting illegal campaign financing from the late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.

The court is expected to deliver its verdict in the latter case in September, and prosecutors have asked for a seven-year prison term. Sarkozy denies the charges.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Iranian missiles evade Israeli air defences to hit refinery and apartment block south of Tel Aviv

Middle East crisis – live updates

Israel attacked Iran's energy industry and defence ministry on the third day of an escalating conflict, as several Iranian missiles evaded Israeli air defences to hit a refinery and rip through a high-rise apartment block south of Tel Aviv.

As fuel depots outside Tehran blazed, Donald Trump presided over the US's biggest military parade in decades. He later said the arsenal on display could be deployed against Iran if it targeted American assets.

The US president said in a social media post: “If we are attacked in any way shape or form by Iran, the full strength and might of the U.S. Armed Forces will come down on you at levels never seen before.”

There is little question that Israel would like the US to join its campaign. Only American weapons can attempt to reach parts of the Iranian nuclear project such as the Fordow uranium enrichment plant, which is buried deep under a mountain.

But while Iran has called off talks with the US on the future of its nuclear programme, and accused Washington of being Israel's “partner” in the offensive launched on Friday, it has held off attacking US bases, embassies or other targets.

With most of its top military echelon assassinated, Israel claiming domination of Iranian airspace from western Iran to Tehran, and several key nuclear sites seriously damaged, the regime in Tehran faces a potentially existential threat.

Perhaps in an appeal to Trump's promotion of himself as the ultimate dealmaker, and his election pitch that he would end America's decades of overseas wars, Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, signalled that Iran was open to attempts to de-escalate.

If Israeli strikes on Iran stopped, “our responses will also stop”, he said. Trump had earlier posted: “We can easily get a deal done between Iran and Israel, and end this bloody conflict!!!”

The US is already trying to promote an exchange of messages with Iran to “calm tensions” with Israel, although the effort falls short of formal mediation, the Haaretz newspaper reported quoting foreign sources.

Trump has spoken about the war with Iranian ally Vladimir Putin, and the emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, who has been in direct contact with the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, since Friday.

G7 leaders flying to Canada for a summit that starts on Sunday are likely to try to use their time with the US president to argue against escalation.

Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, called the leader of Oman, Sultan Haitham bin Tariq al-Said, who had been due to host US-Iran talks, a government spokesperson said. They discussed the importance of halting the conflict and stopping Iran getting nuclear weapons.

For Israel, Saturday night was the bloodiest of the conflict, despite its success in knocking out much of Iran's military hierarchy and parts of its missile systems over the previous day.

Ten people were killed by Iranian strikes on residential buildings, including at least three children, and more than 200 people were injured. Rescuers spent Sunday searching for at least four people missing in the rubble of an apartment block in Bat Yam south of Tel Aviv.

An Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that even advanced air defences could not stop every missile when Iran launched large barrages, as it did on Saturday night.

“In these amounts, of hundreds of projectiles, sadly there will be hits,” the official said. “Even the greatest aerial defence system doesn't get to 100%.”

Benjamin Netanyahu visited the site of the strike on Sunday to see the damage and meet rescue workers. The Israeli prime minister said: “Iran will pay a very heavy price for the premeditated murder of civilians, women and children.”

Israeli attacks on Iran have killed dozens of civilians since Friday, including at least 30 children who died when a missile brought down a high-rise apartment building in Tehran on Saturday. Israel's military says it does not intentionally target civilians.

Iran deployed about 70 missiles overnight, and dozens of drones, although Israel has a higher success rate intercepting those slower-moving projectiles. Over two nights, Iran fired more than 200 missiles at Israel, the official said, and between 20 and 24 of them evaded air defences.

One of those appeared to target a refinery in the northern city of Haifa. In a statement to the Tel Aviv stock exchange, Bazan group said there were no injuries at its plant but pipelines and transmission lines were damaged forcing some facilities to shut down.

Netanyahu said he ordered the pre-emptive operation because Iranian progress towards developing nuclear weapons posed a critical security threat.

After taking out the top of the military hierarchy and vital nuclear scientists, as well as striking key parts of the nuclear programme, Israel appears to be widening its campaign.

It hit energy facilities overnight including an oil depot near Tehran that blazed through the night and a refinery in Bushehr province on the Gulf, and has told people living near arms factories in Iran to evacuate their homes.

An Israeli military official said in the coming days there would be more attacks on “dual use” facilities, and strikes to prevent Iran expanding its stockpile of missiles, estimated to stand at about 2,000 before Friday.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The corporate, political and tech bigwigs meeting in Sweden are worried about an ‘authoritarian axis' – maybe AI drones will fix things?

Deep within the glittering bowels of Stockholm's fanciest hotel, grave ruminations on the future of the world are taking place.

A heady throng of tech billionaires, ministers, corporate titans and the king of the Netherlands have convened in Sweden for the 71st Bilderberg meeting – the publicity-shy annual policy conference that has long sustained conspiracy theorists – hosted this year by the fabulously wealthy Wallenberg family.

The four days of transatlantic talks are taking place at the swanky Grand hotel, which is owned, like so much else in Sweden, by the Wallenbergs. The Swedish PM, Ulf Kristersson, turned up for welcome dinner on Thursday evening, and would have been about halfway through his second plate of meatballs when the first of Israel's rockets dropped on Tehran.

What better time for the prospects of world war three to go up a gear than in the middle of a Bilderberg conflab, with nuclear proliferation slated for discussion, and the heads of Nato and MI6, and two of America's most senior military officers in the room. They're joined in Stockholm by the CEOs of several major defence suppliers such as Palantir, Thales and Anduril. Even the quietly spoken host of the conference, Marcus Wallenberg, happens to run an arms company. He's chair of Sweden's largest defence contractor, Saab.

The Tehran attacks slot happily into the conference agenda, which includes the topics “Middle East” and the rise of an “authoritarian axis” – what Bilderberg insider Nadia Schadlow, a former deputy US national security adviser, describes as “the growing collusion among revisionist powers”.

According to Schadlow: “An authoritarian axis is rapidly coalescing around China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, disrupting the belief that an international community has taken shape in the aftermath of the cold war.”

Earlier this year, the Economist magazine, whose editor sits alongside Schadlow on Bilderberg's steering committee, struck a similar note, declaring: “The rupture of the post-1945 order is gaining pace.” But the Economist handed Donald Trump a fair chunk of the blame for “junking the transatlantic alliance”.

What this means for Bilderberg is that seven decades of hard work nurturing the postwar international order are in danger of going up in – literal – smoke.

Trump's vice-president, JD Vance, has taken every opportunity to lever the US and Europe apart. “Europe being more independent”, he said recently, “is good for the United States.” Back last summer, before the election, he said: “The United States has to focus more on east Asia. That is going to be the future of US foreign policy for the next 40 years, and Europe has to wake up to that fact.” The presence in Stockholm of Samuel Paparo, the head of the US Indo-Pacific Command, is a sign that Bilderberg has taken this to heart. Also, there's another member of the “authoritarian axis” which looms far larger than Iran over this conference: China.

Though the name “China” doesn't actually appear on this year's agenda, the heightening struggle between America and China is a spectre which haunts at least half of the topics being discussed – from the “geopolitics of energy and critical minerals” to “defence innovation and resilience”.

Just a couple of months ago, Eric Schmidt, the former Google boss and longtime Bilderberg board member, warned that “China is at parity or pulling ahead of the United States in a variety of technologies, notably at the AI frontier”. Schmidt suspects that it will be only a matter of “three to five years” before some form of super-intelligent AI is achieved.

“The geopolitical stakes, especially in the race with China, are enormous,” he says, because attaining super-intelligent AI would mean total and unassailable military domination. In short, it would give the winner “the keys to control the entire world”.

But here's the problem – “due to the immense power requirements of large-scale AI”, beating China to the super-intelligent punch would require “potentially 100 times more energy” than is currently available.

The head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, who is conferencing this year at Bilderberg, recently posted on X that “global electricity demand from data centres powering AI is set to soar in the next decade”.

In this desperate winner-takes-all race for the keys to the world, in which the “geopolitics of energy” becomes ever more important, power stations – along with the data centers they feed – are going to become the No 1 military targets.

Cue the AI drones.

For the time being, before AI invents completely new and unimagined ways for us all to kill each other, drones are perhaps the biggest practical application of AI in warfare. There's a healthy swarm of drone manufacturers at this year's Stockholm summit, sharing their hopes and fears about “defence innovation”.

Hovering alongside Eric Schmidt there's the chairman of Thales – “a leader in the fast growing market of unmanned aircraft systems”. Buzzing nearby is Gundbert Scherf, co-founder of German drone and AI company Helsing. One of the early investors in Helsing is also present: the CEO of Spotify, Daniel Ek, which presumably means that the Helsing drones will have the best playlists, booming out suggested songs as they swoop down to attack.

The investment interlinking of Bilderberg participants is particularly intense around autonomous drone tech. Saab is an investor in Helsing. Helsing is collaborating with leading AI company Mistral, whose CEO is attending the conference. Mistral was funded by Schmidt, who's a huge fan of military UAVs.

Schmidt's recent AI/drone expo, which took place last month in Washington, was co-sponsored by Palantir, which was set up by Bilderberg insider Peter Thiel, who is a major funder of Anduril, whose CEO, Brian Schimpf, is also in Stockholm. Schimpf is a former employee of Palantir, whose CEO, Alex Karp, is also on board of Bilderberg, having been ushered on to it by Thiel. And so it goes.

Thiel's fingers can be found wriggling around in an awful lot of pies, not least the juiciest pie of all: the White House. The two senior White House officials at the Stockholm conference, Kevin Harrington and Michael Kratsios, both used to work for Thiel Capital. And Thiel's famously long list of influential acolytes includes none other than Vance.

Only a few days ago, Vance was on a podcast defending Trump's proposed Palantir-powered database on every citizen, which was described by MSNBC as “an unprecedented spy machine that could track Americans”. Vance waved away any such concerns: “I don't believe that Palantir is collecting any information.”

Thank heavens for everyone's freedoms, Palantir is run by self-confessed “classic liberal” Alex Karp. In a recent earnings call, the idiosyncratic CEO said his company was busy “building really great things”, in order “to power the west to its obvious innate superiority”.

Karp throbs with what he calls “productive narcissism” – at Palantir, he insists: “We're proud of our moral stance”. His philosophy, as he sums it up, is this: “If you've done something big and important, you're probably a good person.” Palantir is successful, ipso facto, it's doing good.

As the Economist put it: “Fast approaching is a might-is-right world.” It's a kind of Gordon Gekko morality that would be heartily approved of by Wall Street legend and Bilderberg faithful Henry Kravis of KKR, on whom Gekko was actually based.

Of course, not all the tech luminaries at this year's Bilderberg are thinking in terms of world domination.

Demis Hassabis, the co-founder of DeepMind, turned up in Stockholm with the 2024 Nobel prize for Chemistry in his back pocket and some rather more optimistic rhetoric about AI, which he thinks will usher in an era of “radical abundance”. He thinks of AI as “the cavalry” arriving to save us from ourselves.

He says: “I'd be very worried about society today if I didn't know that something as transformative as AI was coming down the line.”

And Jack Clark, the co-founder of Anthropic, likes to think AI replacing us in every last occupation will help us find new ways of living fulfilling lives. His vision is of a world in which, freed up from our jobs, we'll engage in “creative, fun exercises in getting AIs to build things, or make things, or carry out competitions and games where people can play them with one another”.

Pulling back for a moment from the AI endgame to the world in 2025, there's one rather less jazzy item on the conference agenda worth mentioning – “US economy”.

But even this has everything to do with China. Taking part in the Stockholm summit is Republican congressman Jason Smith, a vocal fan of Trump's “America first” trade policy. Smith has pledged to “continue fighting to combat the economic and national security threat China poses to our great nation”. He's fully aligned with fellow conference goer Robert Lighthizer, an influential economic adviser close to Trump, who told CBS News earlier this year that “China to me is an existential threat to the United States”.

Lighthizer is urging a “strategic decoupling” from Chinese trade, and most importantly, he says: “We should disentangle our technology.”

Here's where Trump's trade vision intersects with not just the long view of Silicon Valley's bullish billionaires, but with the longstanding transatlantic vision of Bilderberg. Thiel recently called for “a very drastic reset with China” and urged other nations to do likewise.And this reset, he thinks, can become “the basis of how we build a stronger western alliance of the free world”.

In other words, look at our success, and join us. Of course, the only thing wrong with this self-fulfilling meritocratic version of western civilization is that if the Chinese succeed in beating the west to the keys of the world, it will mean that they were the good guys after all.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

At least 100 people have been killed in a gun attack on a village in Nigeria's north-central Benue state, Amnesty International Nigeria said on Saturday. 

The attack took place between late Friday and the early hours of Saturday in Yelewata, a community in the Guma area of the state, the rights group said in a Facebook post. 

Dozens of people are still missing, and hundreds were injured and without adequate medical care, it added.

“Many families were locked up and burnt inside their bedrooms. So many bodies were burnt beyond recognition,” Amnesty said. 

Graphic videos and photographs on social media platforms showed what appeared to be corpses and burnt down houses in the aftermath of the attack. 

Udeme Edet, a spokesperson of the police in Benue, confirmed that an attack took place in Yelewata, but did not specify how many people were killed. 

While it remains unclear who was responsible for the killings, such attacks are common in Nigeria's northern region where local herders and farmers often clash over access to land and water. 

The farmers accuse the herders, mostly of Fulani origin, of grazing their livestock on their farms and destroying their produce. The herders insist that the lands are grazing routes that were first backed by law in 1965. 

Last month, gunmen, believed to be herders, killed at least 20 people in the Gwer West area of Benue. In April, at least 40 people were killed in the neighboring state of Plateau.

Thunberg, 22, was put on a flight to France, the ministry said, adding that she would travel on to Sweden from there.

The scientist is accused of shipping biological material months ago to staff at a laboratory at the University of Michigan. The FBI, in a court filing, described it as material related to certain worms and requires a government permit.

Amid heightened global economic uncertainty and rising geopolitical risks, global supply chains and trade patterns are undergoing long-term structural shifts. To help mid-sized corporates navigate these changes, Citi Commercial Bank Taiwan recently hosted two client forums, bringing together Citi experts and cross-border trade specialists to share the latest insights and practical strategies. The events drew nearly 200 corporate representatives and were met with strong engagement.

Adrienne Lui, Citi Taiwan Economist, noted that despite elevated global uncertainties, Taiwan's strong competitiveness in the AI and semiconductor supply chains positions its corporates well to adapt to shifting trade dynamics and evolving global supply chain structures. She emphasized that regardless of future geopolitical developments, markets such as ASEAN, Mexico, and the EU remain key destinations for Taiwanese companies and reposition their international footprint — due to cost advantages, and regional trade frameworks.

Supported by robust demand for AI and emerging technologies, Taiwan's exports to ASEAN and the US reached new monthly highs. According to statistics, in April, Taiwan's exports to ASEAN totaled US$10.46 billion, a 60.2 percent year-on-year increase. Notably, exports to Malaysia surged nearly 116 percent between January and April, making Malaysia Taiwan's third-largest export market after China/Hong Kong and the US — a shift largely attributed to supply chain realignment and production adjustments. In addition, in February, Taiwan's exports to the US exceeded those to China for the first time.

The Citi Commercial Bank Taiwan forums featured expert insights from Adrienne Lui and Catherine Simmons, head of Government Affairs for Japan, Australia, North Asia, and South Asia, who provided in-depth analysis on global economic trends and geopolitical developments. Citi's cross-border solutions team also shared insights on how the bank's services can help mid-sized corporates navigate uncertainty and turn emerging challenges into opportunities.

“In today's highly uncertain market environment and rapidly evolving investment landscape, Citi provides clients with timely market insights and geopolitical perspectives to support strategic decision-making and comprehensive financial solutions for cross-border investment and operational needs. As a global bank, Citi is committed to helping our clients adapt their business models and strategies to fast-changing geopolitical and trade dynamics,” said Michelle Yu, head of Citi Commercial Bank Taiwan.

Lui mentioned the increasing volatility in the global landscape and the pressures arising from shifting capital flows, which are driving corporates to accelerate supply chain restructuring. She further highlighted ASEAN's advantages — including regional trade agreements and market potential — positioning it as the most attractive destination for “China+1” and “China+N” supply chain strategies among international and Taiwanese corporates. She remains positive on Taiwan's economic outlook, supported by AI-driven industrial upgrades and solid GDP growth momentum. Taiwan's competitiveness in AI and semiconductor supply chains provides a strong foundation for navigating trade negotiations and global supply chain adjustments.

Lui emphasized that ASEAN, the USMCA, and the EU markets remain key priorities in Taiwanese companies' global strategies. Beyond these regional frameworks, strengthening trade cooperation with other markets, accelerating de-risking efforts, and pursuing diversified market strategies are necessary considerations for Taiwanese companies seeking to further mitigate risk, enhance competitiveness, and adapt to the evolving global trade system.

As geopolitical tensions and evolving economic policies create new and uncharted territory for countries and companies, Citi's global network is a competitive advantage, and our product depth in managing risk and hedging in global markets is unmatched. Citi has been navigating all types of market environments for our clients for more than 200 years and have built a strategy based on a diversified business mix. With a physical presence in more than 90 markets, and a network serving clients in more than 180 countries and jurisdictions, we are uniquely positioned to support our cross-border clients who are at the heart of our strategy and who will need our support as they adapt to this new world order.


SEASONAL WEAKNESS:
                                        The combined revenue of the top 10 foundries fell 5.4%, but rush orders and China's subsidies partially offset slowing demand                                        Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC, 台積電) further solidified its dominance in the global wafer foundry business in the first quarter of this year, remaining far ahead of its closest rival, Samsung Electronics Co, TrendForce Corp (集邦科技) said yesterday.
TSMC posted US$25.52 billion in sales in the January-to-March period, down 5 percent from the previous quarter, but its market share rose from 67.1 percent the previous quarter to 67.6 percent, TrendForce said in a report.
While smartphone-related wafer shipments declined in the first quarter due to seasonal factors, solid demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) devices and urgent TV-related orders

The lab is TSMC's first laboratory collaboration with a university outside Taiwan, the company said in a statement.
The lab would leverage “the extensive knowledge, experience, and creativity” of both institutions, the company said.
It is located in the Asano Section of UTokyo's Hongo, Tokyo, campus and would be managed by UTokyo faculty, guided by directors from UTokyo and TSMC, the company said.
TSMC began working with UTokyo in 2019, resulting in 21 research projects,

Despite rising demand and high expectations for humanoid robots, high research-and-development costs and uncertain profitability remain major concerns, Lam told reporters following the company's annual shareholders' meeting in Taoyuan.
“Since it seems a bit unworthy to use such high-cost robots to do household chores, I believe robots designed for specific purposes would be more valuable and present a better business opportunity,” Lam said
Instead of investing in humanoid robots, Quanta has opted to invest                                    


EXPANSION:

Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) ignited an electrical substation during a sabotage operation in the Russian city of Kaliningrad, causing $5 million in damage and cutting electricity to a military production site, a source in HUR told the Kyiv Independent. In the early hours of June 14, Ukrainian agents drained the coolant from the substation's power transformer before setting the facility on fire. The inferno inflicted major damage on the facility and caused a power cut, impacting nearby Russian military sites. ""We once again remind you that Russia no longer has a rear either in the east, in the west, or anywhere else on the planet. Everything Russian involved in the war against Ukraine will burn, sink, and be destroyed regardless of its level of protection or location,"" the source said.

Ukraine continues to carry out numerous secretive attacks within Russia and occupied Ukrainian territories, targeting military sites, like airfields, as well as key infrastructure like railways and oil refineries. 

The attacks involve HUR, Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) as well as partisan and sabotage groups. HUR was behind explosions near Desantnaya Bay in Russia's far eastern Vladivostok on May 30, which reportedly damaged military personnel and equipment. The operations took place approximately 6,800 kilometres from the Ukrainian border, making it Ukraine's furthest incursion into Russian territory, if confirmed. On June 1, the SBU launched Operation Spiderweb, a game-changing drone attack on four key Russian military airfields, damaging 41 planes, including heavy bombers and rare A-50 spy planes.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Iran has partially suspended production at the South Pars gas field — the world's largest — after an Israeli airstrike triggered a fire at the site, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported on June 14, according to Reuters. If confirmed, it would mark the first Israeli strike targeting Iran's vital oil and gas infrastructure.

The South Pars field, located offshore in southern Bushehr province, is responsible for the bulk of Iran's gas output. Tehran shares the field with Qatar, which refers to its portion as the North Field. A strike on South Pars represents a significant escalation, coming after oil prices surged 9% on June 13 following Israel's initial wave of attacks, which had not targeted energy infrastructure, Reuters reports. 

Israel launched its air offensive against Iran on June 13, killing commanders and scientists and bombing nuclear sites, in what it described as an effort to prevent Tehran from developing nuclear weapons.

The Iranian oil ministry said the fire caused by the strike has been extinguished. According to Tasnim, the fire broke out in one of four units of Phase 14 at South Pars, halting the production of 12 million cubic meters of gas.

Iran, the world's third-largest gas producer after the United States and Russia, produces around 275 billion cubic meters of gas per year, about 6.5% of global output. 

Due to international sanctions, the country consumes most of this domestically. Qatar, which operates the majority of the shared field with support from global firms such as Exxon and Shell, produces 77 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas annually, supplying both European and Asian markets.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Germany aims to prioritize defense spending in the next EU budget while firmly opposing any increase in national contributions, according to a position paper obtained by the Financial Times (FT). 

As the bloc's largest economy and top net contributor, Berlin wants EU funds to support joint arms procurement and help expand production capacity among European weapons manufacturers.

The paper reportedly reflects Germany's broader shift toward higher domestic military spending in response to Russia's ongoing threat and amid calls by U.S. President Donald Trump for Europe to shoulder more of its own defense. 

Berlin argues the EU budget should also fund dual-use technologies, military transport corridors, and other security-related initiatives despite current treaty restrictions on defence spending from the common budget, according to FT. 

To free up funds for these priorities, Germany proposes cutting administrative costs and simplifying the EU budget structure. The government supports reducing the number of programes, granting the European Commission more flexibility to shift funds, and focusing spending on strategic areas such as cross-border infrastructure, energy security, digitalisation, and innovation.

Germany also opposes any extension of the EU's post-Covid joint borrowing programme, stressing that repayments for the 800 billion euro fund must begin in 2028 as scheduled. While Berlin is open to discussing new EU-level revenue sources such as a carbon border levy or minimum corporate tax, it continues to reject an increase in direct national contributions to the budget, which currently total about 1% of EU GDP.

Let's embrace it as the bridge to energy security","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-g7-natural-gas-energy-security/","Sun, 15 Jun 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

A natural gas pipeline terminus in Kitimat, B.C., September, 2022. Natural gas is among the world's most strategically important energy sources.DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press

John Stackhouse is senior vice-president in the office of the chief executive at Royal Bank of Canada. 

Robert Johnston is senior director of research at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy. 

Kathleen Gnocato is a research analyst at the Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy, at the University of Toronto.

They are contributors to a recent report from RBC on natural gas. 

The G7 was created in the 1970s in response to a worsening Cold War, global energy shock and ensuing economic crisis. More than 50 years later, the same group of leading liberal democracies are meeting this week in Canada to address an eerily similar set of conditions. 

For Europe, North America and Japan, security is back. Energy security, especially. 

This has become a decade of disruption for energy, especially for natural gas. We saw in the early days of the Ukraine war how Russia weaponized gas, signalling what aggression can do to markets. The enormous U.S. build-out of liquefied natural gas has created different distortions for a global gas market that is still evolving. And there's an ongoing debate about the viability and structure of decarbonized gas markets and the role of gas in climate change. If gas is a bridge fuel to renewables, how long is that bridge?

Renewed conflict in the Middle East is adding to that insecurity, particularly as gas-rich Qatar, directly across the Persian Gulf from Iran, accounts for nearly 20 per cent of global LNG exports, and is aiming to double production by 2040.

As the G7 host, Canada is uniquely positioned to help resolve those challenges and set a new course for energy security, global stability, climate action – and the role of natural gas in all three.

Canada to seek agreements in global peace, energy security and new partnerships at G7, Carney says

Natural gas is already among the world's most strategically important energy sources, meeting roughly a quarter of today's needs, and is widely seen as a critical source to power a global population of 9.2 billion by 2040, along with the energy-intensive needs of heavy manufacturing – think reshoring of entire industries – and even hungrier artificial intelligence projects.

Most energy forecasts suggest that in 2040 the world will require more gas, but how much? And what will be the economic and climate consequences?

To map out different pathways, RBC joined forces with Oslo-based Rystad Energy and a group of international researchers in modelling scenarios based on geopolitical forces, policy choices and economic conditions. In one of our scenarios – we call it “Dystopian” because it features shattered international co-operation and unmanaged energy demand – we found the world would need twice as much gas as it produces today. In contrast, another scenario, “Decarbonized,” plays out with rapid decarbonization, where world demand for gas shrinks by roughly a third from today. 

The difference between those outcomes could be roughly 370 million tonnes a year of gas, the equivalent of today's entire production capacity. 

Such uncertainty risks volatile prices, uneven investment in both new and abated gas and insecurity for consumers and producers alike. 

Opinion: Britain needs energy. Canada has energy. Why can't we work together and dream big?

The G7 can address that, as it represents some of the world's biggest producers (the U.S. and Canada) and consumers (Europe and Japan). However, its members are not aligned on gas's role. Canada and the U.S. need long-term contract security to build up infrastructure and strategic supply. Consumers such as France, Japan and Britain want contract flexibility and diversified energy sources such as hydrogen, nuclear and abated natural gas to hedge their risks and meet climate targets. 

As for developing countries, they don't have access to sufficient capital to build out the infrastructure needed to import, regasify, store and distribute LNG. And much of the world is still divided over the climate consequences of gas production and use, in particular the management of its methane emissions.

A concrete strategy for governments and industry begins with a G7 declaration of support for natural gas as an essential bridge fuel to a lower emissions economy, with clear timelines for the transition to a decarbonized gas market built around clean hydrogen, ammonia, methane abatement and the electrification of LNG production. 

The G7 can further throw its weight behind the need to help fast-growing developing countries, especially in Asia and the Global South, as they seek financing and technologies to help switch from coal to gas to renewable energy sources. All of this must be anchored by stronger and more rapid monitoring, accounting and action on flaring, venting and fugitive emissions abatement.

This is not just about the G7. Other democratic allies – Australia and South Korea, in particular, but India, Mexico and a range of South American countries, too – can get behind a new approach to global gas that meets economic ambitions, energy security needs and meaningful climate ambitions. 

Without such conviction, the world risks a future marked by energy insecurity for consumers and producers alike. In short, something like the dysfunctional decade that gave rise to the G7 in the first place.

Overcrowded city centers and housing shortages that displace locals are among the many reasons why Spanish residents are protesting the influx of tourists.

Protests against mass tourism are starting up again in southern Europe ahead of the summer vacation season. They follow large-scale anti-tourism demonstrations in vacation hot spots in Italy, Portugal and especially Spain in recent years.

The coalition of activists and campaigners that make up Sur de Europa contra la Turistizacion (Southern Europe against Touristification) have once again called for large-scale demonstrations on June 15 in Venice, Milan, Lisbon, San Sebastian, Valencia, Barcelona and the Balearic Islands, among other places.

Members of the group recently met for a conference in Barcelona to discuss overtourism, which according to the UN World Tourism Organization is usually defined as the point at which locals or visitors feel tourism has negatively impacted the quality of life in a region to an unacceptable degree.

That is the case for many people in Barcelona, where large-scale demonstrations with thousands of participants have taken place in recent years. Also in the mix are attention-grabbing tactics involving water guns.

In 2024, protesters in Barcelona doused unsuspecting tourists dining along the popular promenade of Las Ramblas in order to draw attention to the problem of overtourism. It worked — a media flurry followed, as did several other incidents involving water guns, which have become something of a symbol of the fight against overtourism in Barcelona. In April, for example, activists blocked a tour bus parked in front of the Sagrada Família — one of the city's top attractions — and soaked stunned tourists with water guns. Chants of ""tourists go home,"" were heard.

""The kind of tourism we have today in Barcelona is not compatible with the lives of the local population,"" Daniel Pardo, a member of the Neighborhood Assembly for Tourism Degrowth (Assemblea de Barris pel Decreixement Turístic), told DW. Pardo has been involved in organizing anti-tourism campaigns for years. He and others want to stop rampant tourism growth, which they say has resulted in noisy streets, air pollution, and overcrowding. ""The moment when it was still possible to find a balance came to an end a long time ago.""

Pardo specifies that it's not only about protesting mass tourism, but rather about going against a ""tourism-first culture"" that prioritizes the tourism industry over the quality of life of many locals.

Around 30 million tourists visit Barcelona a year, a city that is home to around 1.7 million people. The majority came from Italy, France, the United Kingdom and Germany, followed by the United States. According to city officials, the tourism industry generates around 14% of the city's gross domestic product and supports 150,000 jobs.

""Yes, that's always used as an argument for why we shouldn't complain,"" said Pardo. ""But we are still complaining!"" Many jobs in tourism are rife with precarious labor conditions with wages that are below average, he said. ""Ultimately, dependence on tourism impoverishes the population.""

The level of frustration is also high on the Spanish island of Mallorca. Just like in Barcelona, there will be a demonstration in the capital of Palma on June 15 under the motto: ""For the right to a dignified life: Let's stop the touristification."" Other popular vacation spots on the Balearic Islands, as well as in Andalusia, in the Basque Country and on the Canary Islands have also criticized what they see as a ""tourism-first"" mentality taking over their cities. Topping the list of complaints is the increasing number of short-term vacation rentals, which critics say are partly to blame for rising rents that push out locals.

But the short-term rental market is only one aspect of how touristic areas are changing. In some Spanish vacation towns, traditional retail is also disappearing. It's becoming easier to find an ice cream parlor or souvenir store than say, a bakery or supermarket. As a result, locals feel alienated and are moving away.

""Tourism is driving us out of our homes, villages and neighborhoods,"" Spanish group Menys Turisme, Mes Vida (Less Tourism, More Life) wrote on their website in their call to protest on June 15.

In 2024, citizens around Spain also took to the streets to demonstrate against rampant tourism, yet despite the backlash — and the water gun splashes — tourists don't seem to be dissuaded from visiting. In fact, the country is predicting record numbers of tourists in 2025.

In 2024, almost 94 million international travelers came to the country, making it the world's second most popular tourist destination after France. According to a recent study by tourism lobby group Exceltur, the number of short-term rentals has jumped 25% in Spain over the last two years, despite the ongoing housing crisis.

The government has, however, made some recent attempts to mitigate overtourism. In recent months, there has been stricter regulation of vacation rentals. The central government in Madrid recently made it obligatory for short-term rental providers to register their properties in a newly created database in an effort to prevent illegal offers. And in mid-May, the Spanish Ministry of Consumer Protection ordered Airbnb to delete around 65,000 apartment listings that did not include the required registration numbers.

Last June, Barcelona's city council announced it would abolish short-term vacation rentals by 2028, and that licenses will no longer be renewed after they expire. Yet, for better or worse, tourism is one of the main pillars of Barcelona's economy. The growth of the sector has played an important role in the economic revival of the city, say city officials.

However, Jordi Valls, the city official responsible for tourism, admits that tourism in Barcelona cannot continue to grow at the current pace. ""We are reaching our limit,"" he said. 

Activist Daniel Pardo acknowledges that ""at least no politician dares to openly call for further growth"" of the city. But he pointed out that more concrete action needs to be taken to mitigate the problem and improve the lives of residents.

""We need a real debate about the limits of tourism,"" he said. The upcoming protest, he hopes, will see that debate happening sooner.

Nicolas Sarkozy has been stripped of his Legion d'honneur award, France's highest distinction, after his graft conviction. The former French president was found guilty of illegal attempts to obtain favors from a judge.

Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who led France from 2007 to 2012, has had his Legion d'honneur (Legion of Honor) award revoked after his conviction on graft charges, according to a decree published Sunday.

He has thus become the second French head of state to be stripped of the award after Philippe Petain, who headed the collaborationist Vichy regime during World War II and was convicted in August 1945 for high treason and conspiring with the Nazi occupiers.

The widely-expected decision to take the award back from Sarkozy came despite the opposition of current French President Emmanuel Macron, who said in April that he thought that it was important for ""former presidents to be respected.""

The Legion d'honneur, France's highest order of both civil and military merit, was established in 1802 by Napoleon Bonaparte.

Under its rules, recipients automatically lose the award if they are convicted of a crime or receive a prison sentence of at least one year.

Sarkozy, who has been dogged by legal problems since his heavy defeat in the 2012 French presidential election, has been convicted of graft. The conviction was upheld last year by an appeals court, which ordered him to wear an electronic ankle bracelet in place of a one-year jail sentence.

The 70-year-old former president, who had the electronic tag removed this month, was found guilty of trying to secure favors from a judge illegally.

Sarkozy is currently appealing the conviction at the European Court of Human Rights while also being tried in a separate case on charges of accepting illegal campaign financing in an alleged pact with late Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi. 

A verdict in the latter case is expected in September.

Sarkozy, who denies the charges, could face a seven-year prison term if prosecutors have their way.

His legal problems have not prevented him from continuing to have a political presence in right-wing politics in France, and he is also known to hold regular meetings with Macron.

During his time in office, Sarkozy worked closely with former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, particularly on problems associated with the eurozone crisis, earning the pair the sobriquet ""Merkozy.""

As tanks thundered through Washington DC to the thrashing of heavy metal music, millions turned out across the US in protest.

Donald Trump finally had the military parade he had longed for since the days of his first administration, saluting and pumping his fist at the display of 250 years of the US Army's might.

But if he had hoped the spectacle, which coincided with his 79th birthday, would have seen an outpouring of national pride, then he would have been disappointed.

Organisers of what were dubbed the “No Kings” protests claimed at least one million people headed onto the streets to demonstrate against what critics say are the president's monarchical ambitions.

And earlier on Saturday, a Democrat lawmaker and her husband were shot in Minnesota in what governor Tim Walz called a “targeted political assassination”.

Storm clouds had gathered over the US – quite literally. The turn in the weather was so bad it stopped a flyover by F-22s, the most advanced fighter jets in the world, which had been trialled for weeks in advance.

The grand military parade that Mr Trump had been wanting for years barrelled down the streets of DC with tanks, troops and a 21-gun salute.

Mr Trump sat on a special viewing stand south of the White House to watch the display of American military prowess.

Crowds cheered and chanted “USA, USA” as the president and Melania Trump, the First Lady, appeared in the stands.

People did whatever they could to get a view. Standing on concrete pillars, climbing barricades and even opting for the tallest pair of shoulders they could find.

The procession, with more than 6,000 soldiers and 128 Army tanks, managed to avoid the looming threat of a thunderstorm, getting away with only a light drizzle.

Above the streets, the Army's Golden Knights Parachute Team descended from overcast skies toward the reviewing stand.

At times, Mr Trump stood and saluted as troops marched past the reviewing stand.

But attendance appeared to fall far short of early predictions that as many as 200,000 people would attend the festival and parade.

Among the sea of patriots was Tim Pohle, 60, who held a sign mocking the president.

“It's the kind of thing you do in North Korea, or Russia. I don't think this is the right thing for the country to be doing,” he said.

“I just feel I've come to a point where you need to hopefully convince some folks that in the next election, they pick someone who can take the country in another direction.”

The US president smiled as the crowd broke out into a chorus of happy birthday after downplaying suggestions the parade was to commemorate him.

“Every other country celebrates their victories. It's about time America did too,” Mr Trump said.

“The army has forged a legacy of unmatched courage... our soldiers have poured out their blood by the bucketful.

“If you threaten the American people, our soldiers are coming for you.”

Mr Trump has been talking up the strength of the US fighting force amid a looming conflict with Iran, saying that enemies that have challenged it have regretted doing so.

As armoured vehicles rolled through Washington, on the other side of the country, the Marines, whom the president deployed to Los Angeles, were on hand to stop violent protests.

Demonstrations were organised in thousands of towns and cities against the celebration, which critics have likened to a dictatorship.

An estimated million people turned out to march against Saturday's spectacle, organisers claimed.

Aerial photos showed swathes of protests marching through city streets. Some protesters held up Mexican flags, while others bore anti-Trump signs and posters which said “no human is illegal”.

In Los Angeles, pictures showed a huge crowd carrying a balloon bearing a cartoonish resemblance to the president, clad in a nappy.

Dozens of Marines stood shoulder to shoulder in full combat gear beside the National Guard, Homeland Security officers and other law enforcement, as hundreds of protesters facing them jeered in English and Spanish, telling the troops to go home.

The processions come after a week of riots, which saw Mr Trump overrule California governor Gavin Newsom to bring in the National Guard and the Marines to police the unrest.

In Washington DC, there were smaller crowds. Some held signs that included “Where's the due process?” and “No to Trump's fascist military parade” as they marched towards the White House

“No Kings” rallies unfolded in hundreds of cities, designed to counter what organisers said were Mr Trump's plans to feed his ego on his birthday and Flag Day.

Organisers said they picked the name to support democracy and speak out against what they call the authoritarian actions of the Trump administration.

Doug Haynes, a Navy veteran who had voted for Mr Trump, attended the day-long festival to celebrate the Army's birthday, but said the parade “was a little over the top”.

The Army's birthday bash has drawn criticism for its price tag of up to $45 million and the possibility that the lumbering tanks could tear up city streets.

Donning a white shirt embroidered with an American flag the size of his back, Brian Dubuc, 61, had travelled two days to reach the the foot of the monument where he cheered on the president.

“I love the military, I'm very patriotic, from the bottom of my foot to the top of my head,” he said.

“I'm here because I love the military. My dad was in the military,” he added. “It's a tough time right now. There's a lot going on.”

A flyover of military aircraft included World War II-era planes, including a B-25 Mitchell bomber, and Army helicopters flew low over the crowd.

Mounted soldiers from the 1st Cavalry Division made an appearance – horses once played a crucial role in warfare.

Mr Trump swore in 250 new recruits and returning soldiers into service, with soldiers repeating an oath after him.

“Welcome to the United States Army! And have a great life,” he said to them afterwards.

The night ended with a rendition of God Bless the USA by Lee Greenwood and a firework display, which had followed the crowd singing “Happy Birthday” to a beaming Mr Trump.

Read our live blog below for a recap of the full event.

Thanks for following our live coverage of the US Army's birthday parade in Washington, DC. This live blog is now closed.

Lee Greenwood is singing “God Bless the USA”, the song which usually kicks off Donald Trump's rallies.

Donald Trump has been serenaded by the crowd gathered in Washington, DC with a chorus of “Happy Birthday”. The US president turned 79 today, although the administration has insisted today's spectacle was marking the 250th anniversary of the US Army instead.

Donald Trump pays tribute to a series of American military heroes, including Creighton Abrams, the Second World War general.

“The army has forged a legacy of unmatched courage... our soldiers have poured out their blood by the bucketful,” he says.

Mr Trump says it is thanks to American heroes that “America stalls tall, America stands proud, and America stands free - we're the hottest country in the world right now”.

“Liberty got its shield and freedom got its sword” with the founding of the US Army 250 years ago, Donald Trump says.

“Our warriors have shown unrivalled valour on field of valour around the globe... they have marched into the flames and fury of combat, charged up mountains, stormed the beaches, waded through torrents of gunfire,” he continued.

“America's enemies have learned if you threaten the American people our soldiers are coming for you.”

“Our souls are filled with gratitude for every generation of warriors who have worn the uniform of our country all the way back to the very beginning,” Donald Trump says, beginning a speech.

He pays tribute to troops who have made the “supreme sacrifice” and “laid down their lives”.

A concert is now underway after the military parade concluded and Donald Trump delivered the oath of enlistment to soldiers.

Donald Trump, the US president, has led hundreds of soldiers in reciting the oath of enlistment. He is expected to deliver a speech soon, following the conclusion of the parade.

Saturday's “No Kings” demonstrations against Donald Trump's military celebration could be some of the largest in US history.

Organisers said millions took to the streets to protest against the festivities for the US army's 250th anniversary celebration, according to ABC News.

The San Francisco Chronicle reported that experts think the marches could be some of the largest in US history.

Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, has shunned the military parade in Washington for a “No Kings” protest in New York.

“No Kings in America,” he wrote on social media.

In a separate post, he said: “I was so proud to be in New York City today supporting Americans making their voice heard at No Kings protests and pushing back on Donald Trump's authoritarian push to rig the economy for his billionaire buddies.”

M1 Abrams tanks are rolling along the streets of DC, accompanied by Bradley Fighting Vehicles and Strykers.

A formidable battle tank, the 70-ton Abrams combines devastating firepower with a heavy composite armour to protect its four-man crew.

Its front is capable of withstanding direct hits from an RPG, although its flank is more vulnerable.

People are doing whatever they can to get a view. Standing on concrete pillars, climbing barricades and even opting for the tallest pair shoulders they can find.

Your 6ft6 hack has so far avoided requests for a seat. But the hundreds of fathers in the crowd have had no such luck.

The children with the best seat in the house? JD Vance's kids, who appear to be losing their minds at the tanks that have just rolled passed.

Some of the flyovers planned for the military parade have been cancelled because of the poor weather, officials told US media.

It is unclear which aircraft they were referring to, but the overcast skies did not stop a Second World War-era B-25 bomber flying over the crowd with a P-51 Mustang at each wingtip.

The 1st Armoured Division, nicknamed “Old Ironsides” is now marching past the viewing platform.

Donald Trump salutes with one hand and pumps his fist as they move along Constitution Ave, led by a flag-bearer.

The division was formed during the Second World War, in 1940, and later took part in some of the largest tank battles in the US Army's history during the Gulf War.

Sherman tanks, famously used by the US and Allies during the Second World War, are now trundling through the US capital.

Each section of the parade corresponds to a period of history, from the American Revolutionary War to the president day. The Shermans were retired by the US in the early 1950s, shortly after the Korean War.

It was preceded by a B-25 bomber, which became famous for conducting bombing raids of Japan.

JD Vance, the vice president, has published a photo of his children watching the military parade as it heads through Washington, DC.

“Quite a view!” he wrote on social media. They appear to be standing behind bulletproof glass.

Quite a view! pic.twitter.com/BoWtLKXZ3X

As the parade gets into swing, more than 6,000 soldiers dressed in uniforms ranging from the Revolutionary War up to the present day are marching along the National Mall.

Since gaining fame for its daring raids during the Second World War, the B-25s have become one of the US' iconic bombers.

The last aircraft was retired in 1960, but it has now returned to the skies one more time for the military parade, flanked by a P-51 Mustang on either side.

When you think of an American patriot, you think of Brian Dubuc. Donning a white shirt embroidered with that an American flag the size of his back, he's here for one thing only; the military.

“I love the military, I'm very patriotic, from the bottom of my foot to the top of my head,” the 61-year old said.

He has travelled a staggering two days with his family to reach the foot of the monument with a perfect view of the stage where Trump will speak tonight.

“I'm here because I love the military. My dad was in the military,” he adds.

“It's a tough time right now. There's a lot going on.”

The thudding of the 21 gun salute is the only thing louder than the cheers for President Trump, who has just arrived at the parade.

Hail to The Chief follows and so does the start of the parade. Soldiers march wearing the dress form every period the army has fought. It's a moving timeline of the army's history.

Uniformed servicemen have begin marching through the streets of Washington DC as the US army's 250th anniversary parade kicks off proper.

Soldiers carrying American flags have joined bands to march along a stretch of the National Mall.

Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, can be seen applauding and smiling, with the President occasionally saluting the soldiers.

Tonight's festivities have kicked off almost half an hour early, with rain forecast later tonight.

Following reports the festivities could be postponed or even cancelled owing to the weather, Donald Trump this morning wrote on Truth Social that the celebration would go ahead “rain or shine”.

Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, took the stage to address crowds at the 250th anniversary parade for the US army.

Crowds cheered and screamed as Mr and Mrs Trump entered, shortly after which a gun salute rang out against a back drop of chants of “USA, USA”.

Chief Musician SSG Caroline Nielson is now performing a rendition of the Star Spangled Banner.

Tim Pohle, 60, is a brave man. Among the sea of patriots, he holds a sign mocking the president. 

He has never protested before. But the military parade proved to be the final straw that drove him to demonstrate. 

“It's the kind of thing you do in North Korea, or Russia. I don't think this is the right thing for the country to be doing,” he said. 

“I just feel I've come to a point where you need to hopefully convince some folks that in the next election, they pick someone who can take the country in another direction.”

We're interrupted by a man who shouts, “Trump is my king”. But he says he's had nothing but friendly interactions. 

“There are some proud boy who walked by me and showed me a gang sign or something threatening, he adds”.

Los Angeles. Just wow. pic.twitter.com/5MNeg2UaVb

Juliana Balogh, 72 and Kim Muygen, 31, who met at a Donald Trump rally, say they're here for a once in a lifetime experience.

Originally from Vietnam, Ms Muygen says the president's pledged to clamp down on illegal immigration is why she voted for him.

“I'm an immigrant from Vietnam and we came here legally. It took a long time to come here and we pay tax. After five years we applied to become citizens,” she said.

Ms Muygen became a US citizen after legally entering the country and living in LA for more than two decades

“I see people just crossing the border and guessing in it's not fair you have to come here legally.”

Everything is bigger in Texas. But my goodness have they given a good go here in Washington.

Hundreds of tanks, thousands of troops and countless more Maga hats fill Washington DC's National Mall.

But it's not the kind of atmosphere you'd perhaps expect from a gathering of such fierce Trump supporters.

It is instead akin to something much more like a family friendly day out.

Ironic of course, given the sheer amount of weaponry on display.

Donald Trump's wife, Melania, is to make an appearance at the festivities later today.

The president is to speak this evening, following a 21 gun salute and “hail to the chief”.

Mrs Trump is understood to potentially be joining her husband onstage.

“No Kings” protesters marched through the streets of Los Angeles following a week of riots over ICE arrests in the city. 

Thousands of protesters could be seen, some carrying Mexican flags, marching through the Southern Californian city's streets.

Critics have drawn parallels between today's display of military mite and the deployment of National Guard troops and Marines on the streets of LA to help police the riots.

Donald Trump has been locked in an on-going row with California's governer Gavin Newsom after the president went over his head to involve the military in the containment of the protests.

A steady stream of protesters is heading past The Telegraph's Washington, DC offices, apparently heading to the White House.

Footage posted on social media shows demonstrators streaming down 14th Street, waving banners that read “The fascist Trump regime must go” and “Trump must go now”.

It raises the prospect of clashes with law enforcement, after Donald Trump vowed anyone who disrupted his military parade would face “very heavy force”.

“No Kings”, a collection of protest groups which is organising demonstrations across the country, deliberately avoided the US capital to avoid confrontations with the authorities.

A spokesperson for the United States Capitol Police (USCP) confirmed they were aware of the violent incident in Minnesota today. 

Melissa Hortman, the Democratic speaker in Minnesota's House of Representatives, along with her husband, was shot by a gunman in their home in the early hours of Saturday.

John Hoffman, a Democratic state senator, and his spouse were also shot multiple times. Both have received surgery and are expected to survive, officials say.

A spokesperson for the USCP told NBC News: “The United States Capitol Police is aware of the violence targeting state lawmakers in Minnesota. We have been working with our federal, state and local partners. For safety reasons, we cannot provide specific details about our security posture.”

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has wished Donald Trump and the US Army a “double happy birthday”.

Me Netanyahu, speaking as Israel strikes Iran in an attempt to derail its nuclear programme, paid tribute to Mr Trump as a “decisive, courageous” leader who had been an“extraordinary friend to the Jewish state and to me personally”.

“We appreciate what you're doing now, helping protect Israeli lives against the criminal regime in Iran,” he said.

Mr Netanyahu added: “I want to wish also a 250th Happy Birthday to the American Army.

“The men and women of the armed services of the United States have protected freedom for two and a half centuries. We would not have a free world without you. Thank you on behalf of free peoples everywhere.”

“No Kings” protest leaflets have been found in the car of a man suspected of shooting dead a Democrat politician and her husband in Minnesota.

Melissa Hortman, the Democratic speaker in Minnesota's House of Representatives, along with her husband, was killed by a gunman in their home in the early hours of Saturday, in what authorities said appeared to be a “politically motivated assassination”.

John Hoffman, a Democratic state senator, and his spouse were also shot multiple times. The pair are expected to survive, officials said.

Minnesota police released an image of dozens of leaflets about the “No Kings” protests, demonstrating against Donald Trump and his military parade, on the seat of a car belonging to the suspect.

“Given the targeted shootings of state lawmakers overnight, we are asking the public to not attend today's planned demonstrations across Minnesota out of an abundance of caution,” they said in a statement.

As US tanks and troops parade through the streets of Washington, DC, protests are expected to take place across the country.

Organisers say the “No Kings” demonstrations, protesting against Donald Trump, will be held in around 2,000 towns and cities across the US - but not the capital, to avoid clashes with law enforcement.

They hope to create a “split-screen” between the displays of military power in Washington contrasted against anti-Trump protests elsewhere.

Donald Trump has insisted the military celebration will go ahead “rain or shine” following a report that the military celebration could be cancelled or rescheduled owing to adverse weather conditions.

A source told The Times that a looming thunderstorm warning for this weekend could be a threat to public safety, and may see the event cancelled.

Residents of America's capital last night also received mobile phone alerts, warning them of flash flooding in the city.

However, Mr Trump this morning wrote on his Truth Social site: “Our great military parade is on, rain or shine. Remember, a rainy day [parade] brings good luck. I'll see you all in DC.”

There are thunderstorms forecast for the weekend, and protesters planning to rain on his military parade, but there's one piece of good news for Donald Trump on his 79th birthday.

Polling shared with The Telegraph shows significant support for the president's deployment of troops to clamp down on riots in Los Angeles, with the public backing his move by a margin of 14 per cent.

Initially, Mr Trump's decision to send the National Guard and US Marines to the city of angels had threatened to cast a cloud over his parade on Saturday, with soldiers detaining US citizens during what was meant to be a shared celebration of the country's military history.

James Johnson, co-founder of JL Partners, which conducted the polling, said it showed the president was “very much winning the battle of public opinion when it comes to the protests”.

			Fewer plenary sessions and more one-on-one meetings as world leaders adapt to return of unpredictable US president

The Canadian organisers of the G7 summit are taking no chances with Donald Trump this week, ditching the usual joint communiqué, padding the event with extra guests and reducing the amount of time when the world leaders sit around the same table.

It is the latest example of how global institutions are adapting to the return of an unpredictable and combative figure.

A diplomat in Washington DC, who has seen the schedule, said it included fewer plenary sessions of the full group and more one-on-one meetings

“There's a lot more of that than at other summits,” he said, “which would make sense if you are worried about one person causing trouble.”

The last time Mr Trump attended a G7 summit in Canada he stormed off early, ripping up a joint communiqué and leaving a trail of withering tweets behind him.

His blanket use of trade tariffs has already set nerves on edge, according to Matthew P Goodman, who was deputy to the US G7 Sherpa during the Obama administration, one of the figures doing the heavy lifting on negotiations.

“Those two issues hang over this upcoming summit, and are going to make it very challenging for the host, Mark Carney, to manage this,” he said.

Canadian diplomats were buoyed by their new prime minister's performance at the White House recently, when he avoided the sort or tongue lashing delivered to some other world leaders.

But organisers are leaving nothing to chance.

World leaders are due to begin arriving on Sunday. They will fly into the international airport in Calgary from where they will helicopter to the picturesque setting of Kananaskis, deep in the Canadian Rockies.

Organisers have padded the number of attendees by inviting leaders from India, Brazil, Ukraine, Australia and Saudi Arabia (although Crown Prince Mohamed Bin Salman reportedly will not be attending).

Cyril Ramaphosa, the South African president, is coming. He knows better than most how Mr Trump can undo the best laid plans after being ambushed last month in the Oval Office and accused of allowing a “white genocide” to unfold.

Mark Rutte, Nato secretary general, and António Guterres, the UN secretary general, are expected to attend.

There will also be a session on fentanyl smuggling, a cause particularly close to Mr Trump's heart.

The result is more breakaway bilateral meetings and fewer chances for Mr Trump to clog up the agenda.

Mr Goodman said: “Any host of these forums, if they're smart, will minimise the time around the table. You need a certain amount of that, but you want to allow for a lot of time on the margins for bilateral conversations and meetings”

In 2018, Justin Trudeau, Canada's prime minister at the time, presided over a G7 summit where Mr Trump abruptly pulled the US out of a previously agreed communiqué, before blasting his host as “dishonest and weak”.

He flew out of Canada early, apparently upset at the way Mr Trudeau had talked about Canadian tariffs on US exports.

It meant weeks of careful negotiations on easing trade tensions between the US and the European Union went up in smoke.

This time Mr Carney is preparing to issue a chairman's statement, according to The Toronto Star, avoiding the need for all the parties to agree on a joint position on awkward issues such as Ukraine or Israel's strikes on Iran.

“Our hope is that Mr Trump will join us in getting tougher on Russia and push through new sanctions,” said a senior diplomat from a G7 nation. “But he could equally say, no, let's give them another two weeks and then there is no chance for agreement.”

That makes it almost impossible to make progress on a joint text ahead of the summit, he added.

“The problem is that no one knows what's on Trump's mind,” he said. “Negotiating in the absence of that is not easy.”

The G7 summit is not the only high-stakes diplomacy this month. Nato leaders will assemble in The Hague next week, where defence spending will be top of the agenda.

Summit organisers there are preparing a one-page communiqué, The Telegraph revealed on Friday, designed to suit Mr Trump's attention span.

It will be almost entirely focused on one of the president's pet issues and the historic decision to more than double spending on defence by leaders to meet new capability targets for deterring a Russian invasion.

Mr Trump stormed out of his last Nato summit in the UK in 2019, abandoning plans for a press conference, after Mr Trudeau was caught on video apparently mocking the American president.

He was talking to Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, and Emmanuel Macron, the French president, discussing how Mr Trump liked to use photo opportunities to talk to the press.

Police used batons, tear gas, and “non lethal” projectiles to disperse “No Kings” protesters on Saturday.

On Saturday morning tens of thousands of protesters gathered in downtown Los Angeles as part of the nationwide “No Kings” demonstrations. Organizers estimated there were over 40,000 people in the crowd. Protesters carrying signs denouncing Trump as well as Mexican, Palestinian, and U.S. flags (sometimes upside down) marched through the streets. They demanded “ICE Out of LA” and denounced Trump's authoritarian maneuvers, including sending the National Guard to the city. The marches were at once political and festive, and National Guard soldiers could even be seen posing for pictures with protesters. 

In the afternoon, as the marches came to an end, thousands spread out across downtown to continue the protests — some to the immigration detention center, others to the federal building, and others surrounded City Hall. Around 4pm, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) issued a dispersal order, but kettled people in so they could not leave. Then, the sheriffs and cops fired tear gas and pushed the protesters, unprovoked. They trampled an elderly man with their horse and then clobbered him with their batons and fired round after round of less than lethal projectiles at the crowd. The police chased people down, hitting protesters indiscriminately. They beat people bloody.

Karen Bass, the city's first Black female mayor, and Governor Gavin Newsom — both Democrats — invited the charge. While they denounced the intrusion of the National Guard, they made sure to call out the “violent” protesters but made no mention of the LAPD and the LASD's violence. 

This is because Democratic Party, just like the Republican Party, is beholden to private property and those who have the most of it: the capitalists. They defend the raids of immigrant communities, just not in the aggressive style of Trump. The uprisings in Los Angeles of Black and Brown youth, including the street takeovers and confrontations with police, are a reason people were in the streets yesterday. They are what Democrats and Republicans fear the most: unity between a combative, precarious working class youth and immigrants; and a rank-and-file labor movement. 

The labor movement, along with the youth, are the reason why Service Employees International Union (SEIU) president David Huerta is free and they inspired the entire country to come out to the “No Kings” protests. The labor movement must defend the youth in the streets and organize the rank and file using its own weapons, especially the strike. Unions in LA have gone on strike in the last year including SEIU 721; the United Auto Workers (UAW 4811), who went on strike for Palestine, and many others. A general strike in Los Angeles or across the region would be a powerful show of our strength that would give direction to the movement and could force ICE out for good. 

Breaking with the capitalist parties is a political necessity. Both Democrats and Republicans have attacked worker's living standards. They keep rent prices high and wages low; they are united in deportations and repression of precarious and unemployed youth; and they sicced the cops on the protesters last night. Both parties are the enemies of the working class. 

As the protests in Los Angeles continue, we need to organize and strategize. Socialism is the political ideology that seeks for workers to organize their workplace under direct control and communities without bosses, landlords, cops, or ICE. To make this a reality, we need a working class party that fights for socialism — a combat party to organize ourselves politically and in the streets.

The labor actions are built on a decades-long tradition of internationalism, anti-militarism, and anti-imperialism.

On June 4, in response to the unfolding genocide in Gaza, France's CGT dockworkers refused to load arms components bound for Israel at the country's largest port in Fos-Marseille. Their action forced the ship to leave port without its deadly cargo.

Across Europe, dockers carried on the fight. In Genoa, Italian dockworkers pledged to inspect the same vessel and block it if weapons were found. At the Italian ports of Salerno and Scilla, the ship sparked protests. Sophie Binet, the CGT's national secretary-general, called on the French government to immediately halt arms deliveries to Israel.

This was no one-off protest. It built on a decades-long tradition of internationalism, anti-militarism, and anti-imperialism among European dockworkers, including coordinated actions to block weapons to Saudi Arabia in 2019.

As organizers with Workers in Palestine, we support trade unionists around the world who are building solidarity with Palestine. Some of the most powerful actions we've seen in the labor movement globally have come from European dockworkers.

In November 2023 the European Dockworkers Council, an autonomous organization of 14 base-level dockworker unions across 12 countries, organized a coordinated day of action against war and for world peace. That sparked further action: Dockworkers from Barcelona announced they would not handle to arms to Israel. And in October 2024, dockworkers from Greece's Port of Piraeus stopped a shipment carrying arms.

The most sustained action came earlier this year, after 68 percent of Swedish Dockworkers Union members voted to stage a six-day boycott of all military cargo to and from Israel. The boycott was entirely legal, and Sweden's labor courts unanimously upheld it in a preliminary ruling.

Yet on the very day of that legal victory, SDU spokesperson and national deputy chair Erik Helgeson was fired by his employer, Gothenburg RoRo Terminal. His dismissal was a blatant act of retaliation and an attack on workers' right to organize and take meaningful political action.

The Swedish dockers have not backed down. Following a breakdown in contract negotiations, they launched industrial action in May, striking on demands that include stronger protections for union representatives. They are simultaneously pursuing a legal case against the employer and have built a growing campaign across Europe demanding Helgeson's reinstatement.

Dockworkers across Europe have acted in solidarity with the striking Swedish dockers. Belgian dockworkers from the ACV union in Ghent and Zeebrugge refused to handle a ship loaded by strike-breakers from the Swedish city of Gothenburg.

All of this is unfolding against the backdrop of Israel's ongoing attack on Gaza, abetted by the U.S. and other Western governments who continue to provide arms to Israel. Entire communities have been reduced to rubble by Israel's daily bombing. Palestinian trade unionists who remain in Gaza are working tirelessly to keep their communities alive — running soup kitchens, providing mutual aid, and continuing the vital work that trade unions do in times of crisis.

Blockades by dockworkers stand out as one of the most concrete and disruptive forms of solidarity that workers can offer when governments refuse to act. Dockers are showing what it takes to build sustained resistance to war and oppression.

The task ahead is to ensure that such solidarity is not exceptional, but woven into the fabric of our unions so that workers are ready to act not just for one moment, but for the long haul.

Toronto, Vaughan, Brampton, and Calgary have all passed bylaws that infringe on protest rights, and Ottawa may be next.

Montreal, Canada – Civil rights advocates and Palestinian solidarity groups in Canada have raised alarm over a growing wave of municipal bylaws prohibiting protests outside houses of worship, schools, and other sites.

They say the measures — which have been passed in Canada's largest city, Toronto, among other places, and are being considered elsewhere — infringe on freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly.

Activists have also warned that the bylaws are part of a wider push to stifle demonstrations against Israel's genocidal war against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.

“It's clear that this isn't a response to an overall concern around the management of protest,” said Tim McSorley, national coordinator of the International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group, a coalition of dozens of civil society groups in Canada.

Instead, the bylaws are “a response to the overwhelming and unsubstantiated attacks on pro-Palestinian protests across the country,” McSorley told Truthout in an interview. “It's based in anti-Palestinian racism and based in the characterization of those who would protest in favor of Palestinian human rights, against the ongoing genocide, as all being supporters of terrorism, which is clearly not the case.”

On May 22, the Toronto city council passed what has been colloquially referred to as a “bubble zone” bylaw, prohibiting certain rallies within 50 meters (164 feet) of places of worship, schools, child care centers, and other institutions.

The regulation prohibits gatherings that discourage attempts to use the site; “obstruct, hinder or interfere with” access to the site; or “express an objection or disapproval towards any person” based on race, religion, citizenship, or other factors. 

Individuals found to be violating the bylaw — which will come into force on July 2, 2025 — will face a fine of up to $5,000 Canadian ($3,650 USD).

The move followed the passage of similar bylaws in the Toronto-area cities of Vaughan and Brampton, as well as in Calgary in the western province of Alberta. The city council in Ottawa, the Canadian capital, is also considering a similar measure.

The protest was organized there because the synagogue was hosting a real estate event that included homes in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, which are illegal under international law.

And while the Toronto bylaw states that it “does not prohibit peaceful gatherings, protests or demonstrations,” civil rights advocates say unequivocally that the measure — and others like it — aims to stifle demonstrations.

David Mivasair, a rabbi and active member of the group Independent Jewish Voices-Canada, said the wave of Toronto-area bylaws came in response to a large demonstration that was held last year at a local synagogue.

The protest was organized there because the synagogue was hosting a real estate event that included homes in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, which are illegal under international law.

“If car thieves were running a used car sale in the parking lot of a synagogue, and the police knew that's what was going on, they would shut it down immediately. What we had was land thieves selling properties inside a synagogue,” Mivasair told Truthout.

He added that the purported issue that the bylaws are seeking to address — religious-based intimidation targeting people at their houses of worship — is a false problem.

“No one that I'm aware of has ever protested at a house of worship while people are worshipping because they're somehow opposed to people worshipping. That's not what's going on,” he told Truthout in an interview.

Instead, Mivasair said the bylaws “are intentionally designed — engineered — by major Zionist organisations in Canada who want to suppress honest, public discourse about Israel and Palestine” and outlaw Israel-related protests.

Indeed, the demonstration at the synagogue had drawn the ire of pro-Israel lobby groups in Canada, which had been calling for protests to be banned near Jewish community institutions after Israel's Gaza war began in October 2023.

When the City of Vaughan introduced its bylaw to ban protests within 100 meters (328 feet) of “vulnerable social infrastructure” last year, the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs welcomed the move.

“In a democratic and pluralistic society, we should expect to be faced with people we disagree with.”

The center — arguably Canada's most prominent pro-Israel organization — has been pushing for strict enforcement of the bans, saying in December of last year that it was “crucial” for the Toronto bylaw to “have teeth.”

“It must include punitive measures for noncompliance, contain enforcement powers, and, most importantly, it must be enforced,” the group said.

The center has also lobbied for legislation at the federal level that would criminalize what it dubs “dangerous protests” outside institutions.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney appears to be considering a federal prohibition in line with what the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs and other pro-Israel lobby groups have been calling for.

On May 22, Carney wrote in a social media post denouncing the deadly shooting of Israeli embassy workers outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., that his government would “introduce legislation to make it a criminal offence to intentionally and willfully obstruct access to any place of worship, schools and community centres.”

The legislation would also make it “a criminal offence to willfully intimidate or threaten those attending services at these locations,” the prime minister said.

But legal experts say the bylaws violate Canada's constitution, known as the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

The charter outlines four fundamental freedoms in Canada, including freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly. It states that those freedoms can only be limited if such limits “can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.”

“They're trying to shut down the public's right to express disapproval.”

Christine Van Geyn, litigation director at the Canadian Constitution Foundation, said last month that the bylaws fail to meet that test.

“The right to protest is a fundamental right of Canadians. This new bylaw [in Toronto] will prohibit public protests on matters of public interest and will unjustifiably infringe on the right to freedom of expression,” Van Geyn said in a statement.

“While many Canadians disagree with and are upset with some of the protests we have seen in Toronto lately, there is no right not to be offended. In a democratic and pluralistic society, we should expect to be faced with people we disagree with,” she said.

James Turk, director of the Centre for Free Expression at Toronto Metropolitan University, also said the bylaws are unnecessary insomuch as Canada already has laws on the books around illegal behaviour at protests.

“Engaging in violence in Canada, threatening violence, engaging in hate speech as is defined in the Criminal Code and by our courts, obstructing people from going into buildings — are all currently against the law,” Turk told Truthout in an interview.

“A new bylaw is not going to do anything to change that,” he said, adding that in Toronto, the city police service came out against the bylaw by saying it already had the tools necessary to respond to demonstrations.

The solicitor for the City of Toronto also acknowledged that the bylaw would likely face a legal challenge.

According to a confidential report obtained by the Toronto Star, the solicitor had said the city should “narrowly” tailor the bylaw so that it could argue that it limited as much as possible any infringements on the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

But the city council stripped away many of the guardrails the solicitor had proposed, including a requirement for institutions seeking to enforce the bylaw on their property to show that a demonstration had taken place there before when applying for protected site status (i.e., applying to have the bylaw actively enforced at their site).

The text of the bylaw that was passed now only states that the owners of an institution must “reasonably believe” a gathering prohibited under the regulations “may occur” within 50 metres (164 feet) of their property. They can then be approved to apply the bylaw for a one-year period, with option to renew for another year.

“People who were pretty zealous to have a bylaw passed — and it was largely some of the pro-Israeli lobby groups — were able to pressure council enough that they undid most of the narrow provisions” in the earlier draft, Turk said.

He said a legal challenge is likely once the bylaw is applied in practice.

And given the Toronto city council's decision to flout the advice it received from its solicitor, Turk said it will be “much easier to show the court that they were pretty careless with regard to ensuring the protection of constitutional rights in what they've done.”

“I think there's a very good possibility that it will be overturned,” he said. “It pretty clearly, on the face of it, is unconstitutional.”

The experts Truthout spoke with said the wave of bylaws ultimately aim to stifle public debate and dissent.

McSorley at the International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group said the measures must be seen as part of a wider pushback against “language and opinions and actions … that disturb, which offend, and which make people feel uncomfortable.”

“It's not something that we can legislate out of existence,” he said.

“If we bring in laws banning protests outside of certain areas, it sets a precedent. The worry would be that this makes it easier to then bring in other laws restricting protests, or expanding what kind of institutions would fall under these kinds of exclusions.”

Turk at the Centre for Free Expression also explained that freedom of peaceful assembly includes all sorts of disruptive behaviour — short of violence or advocating violence — since “the very nature of assembly is to draw public attention to an issue.”

“They're trying to shut down the public's right to express disapproval,” Turk said about the proponents of the bylaws.

“At the heart of it, this is about restricting public debate and protest in a democratic society,” he added. “The only purpose of this is to take away the public's right to debate and protest and speak publicly about issues that others in the community don't want to hear protests about.”

            Rory McIlroy just wants to go home.
    


            After three rounds at Oakmont Country Club at this year's US Open, the Northern Irishman is over it.
    


            When asked what he wanted from Sunday's final round after a frustrating first three rounds at the 125th US Open, the Masters champion said: “Hopefully a round in under four-and-a-half hours and get out of here.”
    


            McIlroy's triumph at Augusta earlier this year made him the sixth golfer in history to complete the career grand slam. It was his first major championship win in more than a decade after multiple close calls, and the golf world collectively wondered whether McIlroy could go on to huge success in 2025 with the Masters monkey off his back.
    


            That's not been the case, not by a longshot.

            The five-time major winner has cut a frustrated figure throughout this week's US Open outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He's been seen throwing clubs, smashing tee box markers, tossing his putter into the air after missing putts and – as he did at the PGA Championship last month – blowing off reporters after his rounds.
    


            When he spoke on Saturday after his 4-over 74, McIlroy admitted that he hadn't felt the same after his Masters win.
    


            “You don't know how you're going to react to such a – I wouldn't say a life-altering occasion, but at least something that I've dreamt about for a long time,” he said, adding “I have felt a little flat on the golf course afterwards.”
    


            McIlroy is a crowd favorite here at Oakmont, attracting some of the largest galleries on the course. Spectators holler “Let's go, Rory!” whenever he walks past, whether that's after one of the two birdies he carded on Saturday or the six bogeys that left him shaking his head.
    


            But it seems no amount of support is cutting through McIlroy's frustration at the moment. He managed to book himself a weekend tee time with a remarkable closing stretch on Friday, playing 2-under after starting his round with two double bogeys on the first three holes. The question on everyone's lips during his Friday afternoon struggle was simple: “Is Rory going to miss the cut?”
    


            A brilliant birdie on 18, set up by one of the best approach shots hit by McIlroy since that Sunday playoff at Augusta, wasn't so much fueled by his competitive nature as it was his apathy toward playing another two days at the US Open.
    


            “It's funny. It's much easier being on the cut line when you don't really care if you're here for the weekend or not,” he told reporters with a laugh. “I was sort of thinking, ‘Do I really want two more days here or not?' So, it makes it easier to play better when you're in that mindset.”
    


            Unlike his friend and early-rounds playing partner Shane Lowry – whose rage at the course was clear from the start, including a moment when he dropped a four-letter expletive caught by a hot mic after missing a putt on Friday – McIlroy is still here.

            It seems that it's much to his chagrin – especially at the prospect of answering questions from the media.
    


            McIlroy said earlier this month that he didn't speak to the media at the PGA Championship in May because he was angry after it was reported that his driver was nonconforming ahead of the tournament, expressing that information was supposed to be confidential and someone leaked it.
    


            Ahead of the RBC Canadian Open, McIlroy stressed to reporters that speaking to the media wasn't something required of players. When asked about those comments on Saturday, he said he wasn't trying to force PGA Tour officials to require players to speak to the media.
    


            Instead, his desire to skip post-round interviews is purely frustration with the media and he'd continue to skip talking after rounds if he didn't feel like it.
    


            “I feel like I've earned the right to do whatever I want to do, yeah,” he said.

            The beast that is Oakmont's setup for this tournament is punishing players who make the tiniest mistake. McIlroy is no different and, while he feels like he's played “OK” this week, the mental game is weighing on him.
    


            “That's the name of the game this week is staying patient, and try to do a good job of it out there, but it's one of those golf courses that you can lose patience on pretty quickly,” he said.
    


            He added, “It's very difficult. You got to be on every single shot. You know if you miss a fairway you're going to be scrambling for par. You know if you miss your landing spot even coming from the fairways by a couple yards, these greens repel the ball into rough and you're up against collars and it just makes things very, very tricky. So, yeah, you got to be totally on your game.”
    


            It's clear that McIlroy is not on his game, a disappointing fact that has led to viral moments of anger that will be the lasting memories of his 2025 US Open. With next month's Open Championship being held in his home nation's Royal Portrush, McIlroy will be hoping to get himself out of this funk and back toward the top of the leaderboard.
    


            He tees off for his final round of the US Open on Sunday morning, hours before the leaders arrive on the Oakmont grounds as they push for the trophy that McIlroy won in 2011.
    


            If his demeanor on Saturday is any indication, he'll be long gone by the time the 18-inch, sterling silver cup is raised.

            Several residential areas were hit in the latest Israeli strikes, according to witnesses and state media.
    


            A local journalist told CNN that he was near a square in the city when he heard several explosions. He said that the windows of offices near the explosion were all destroyed, and that ambulances had rushed to the scene.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Fox News on Sunday that he launched airstrikes against Iran to prevent “a nuclear holocaust,” claiming his government had intelligence that Iran was months away from developing an initial nuclear weapon.
    


            “We had to act,” Netanyahu told Fox's Bret Baier on Sunday. “It was the 12th hour, and we did act. To save ourselves but also … to protect the world from this incendiary regime.”
    


            “The intel we got and we shared with the United States was absolutely clear: That they were working in a secret plan to weaponize the uranium, they were marching very quickly, they would achieve a test device and possibly an initial device within months, and certainly less than a year,” he said.
    


                    “That is something that we couldn't possibly accept,” he continued. “We will not have a second holocaust, a nuclear holocaust. We already had one, in the previous century – the Jewish state is not going to have the holocaust committed on the Jewish people. It's not going to happen.”
                





            Netanyahu also claimed that Israel saw enough enriched uranium for nine bombs. “All they had to do was weaponize them. We stopped that.”
    


            Asked if regime change was among his objectives in Iran, Netanyahu said: “It could certainly be the result, because the Iran regime is very weak.”
    


            Netanyahu said “80% of the people would throw these theological thugs out.”
    


            “They shoot women because their hair is uncovered. They shoot students. They just suck the oxygen out from these brave and gifted people, the Iranian people.”
    


            “The decision to act, to rise up this time, is the decision of the Iranian people.”
    


            Ukraine's foreign ministry has said five of the victims of an Iranian strike on the central Israeli city of Bat Yam on Sunday were Ukrainian citizens.
    


            “As a result of a massive Iranian missile attack against Israel, and a missile hitting a residential building in Bat Yam, five Ukrainian citizens, including three minor children, were killed,” the foreign ministry said in a statement Sunday, citing preliminary information from the Embassy of Ukraine in Israel.
    


            The death toll from the strike currently stands at seven people.
    


            Ukrainian diplomats are working with Israeli police to identify and repatriate the bodies, the statement detailed.
    


            Israel's military says it has struck “an Iranian aerial refueling aircraft at Mashhad Airport in eastern Iran,” deep in Iran's northeast, in what it claims is the longest-range strike it has conducted since its operation began.
    


            Mashhad International Airport is around 70 miles from Iran's border with Turkmenistan; the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement Sunday it is about  1,430 miles (2,300 kilometers) from Israel.
    


            “The IAF is operating to establish aerial superiority over Iranian airspace. This marks the longest-range strike conducted since the beginning of the operation,” the IDF said in a statement.
    


            President Donald Trump acknowledged that US involvement in the conflict between Israel and Iran is a possibility during a phone interview with ABC News on Sunday.
    


            “We're not involved in it. It's possible we could get involved. But we are not at this moment involved,” Trump told ABC's Rachel Scott.
    


            When asked if there's a deadline for Iran to come to the table, the president said “no,” according to Scott.
    


            “No, there's no deadline, but they are talking. They'd like to make a deal. They're talking. They continue to talk,” Trump said.
    


            The next round of US-Iran nuclear negotiations, scheduled to take place in Oman on Sunday, was canceled. But Trump said the Iranians “want to talk, and they will be talking,” adding that the recent escalations “may have forced a deal to go quicker, actually.”
    


            Trump also expressed a willingness to consider Russian President Vladimir Putin as a potential mediator in the conflict, noting that Putin had reached out to him.
    


            “He is ready. He called me about it. We had a long talk about it,” the president said.
    


            The death toll from Iranian strikes on Israel since Friday has risen to 14, Israel's Government Press Office said Sunday.
    


            Another body was recovered in the city of Bat Yam in central Israel, after an Iranian strike hit a residential building.
    


            At least seven people were killed in that strike, according to emergency services and government officials.
    


            Iran's president has said the United States “undoubtedly plays a direct role” in Israel's military operation, Fars state media agency reported.
    


            The outlet quoted President Masoud Pezeshkian as saying; “[US Special Envoy Steve] Witkoff told [Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas] Araghchi, ‘Israel cannot do anything without our permission' – this means Israel's actions are carried out with direct approval from the United States.”
    


            Pezeshkian continued to claim that “what we are witnessing today is being done with Washington's direct backing, even though they try to conceal their role in the media.”
    


            The president said that while Iran has never sought war or conflict, any continuation of hostilities would be met with “decisive and severe” retaliation.
    


            The administration of US President Donald Trump has not critiqued the weeks-long timeframe in private discussions, an Israeli official told CNN. A White House official said the administration was aware and implicitly supportive of Israel's plans.
    


            Israeli foreign minister Gideon Sa'ar has said his government anticipated casualties in the wake of its audacious assault on Iran, but it “didn't have any other choice.”
    


            “When we took this historic decision, tough decision, we knew we will have difficult times and we will face casualties, but saying that, we didn't have any other choice,” Sa'ar said in an exclusive interview with CNN's Bianna Golodryga on Sunday.
    


            At least 13 people have been confirmed dead in Israel due to Iran's retaliatory strikes, including three minors.
    


            The foreign minister said assessments of Iran's nuclear program showed it could have made an atomic bomb “within six months,” reiterating claims that Iran had enough enriched uranium for nine nuclear bombs.
    


            When asked whether unseating Iran's regime, led by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is one of Israel's goals in this latest conflict, Sa'ar said: “The goal is not a regime change… This is for the Iranian people to decide, we, Israel… don't see the Iranian people as our enemies.”
    


            The foreign minister thanked the United States for their military aid, but added it is up to them as “a sovereign state” to decide whether they would directly assist Israel in eliminating Iran's military facilities. “They have their calculations, and they'll decide,” he said.
    


            Former US Vice President Mike Pence issued a stark warning during an interview Sunday on CNN's State of the Union with Dana Bash as Israel detected more missile launches from Iran.
    


            “Iran will never be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon,” Pence said, when asked by Bash about the ongoing tit-for-tat attacks between the two nations. “And witnessing in the skies just moments ago, you can see the reason why,” Pence continued.
    


            Pence went on to elaborate on the broader dangers of a nuclear-armed Iran and reiterated a hardline stance against Iran's nuclear ambitions.
    


            “Remember, those missiles that Iran has developed over the years can reach Europe, today. They've been working on intercontinental ballistic missiles that could reach the United States, and Iran is the leading state sponsor of terrorism,” the former vice president said.
    


                    “It threatens our allies, threatens people of the United States,” he added.
                





            “During our administration, we made that clear. I'm grateful for President Trump's strong statements of support for Israel and its action,” Pence said reflecting on his time in office, emphasizing the Trump administration's firm position on Iran's nuclear ambitions.
    


            “I want to say emphatically that if the world knows nothing else, the world should know this, America stands with Israel,” Pence said.
    


            But the former vice president also offered a warning to both the current administration and his former boss, after Bash pressed him on Trump's recent comments on his call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
    


            “Vladimir Putin continues his brutal and unprovoked invasion in Ukraine using drones provided by Iran, I would say respectfully to the administration. We ought to be looking elsewhere than Vladimir Putin for advice on how to deal with this situation,” Pence said.
    


            The US and Russian presidents held an hourlong phone call on Saturday, Trump confirmed in a social media post, adding that the leaders spoke about Iran and Israel's tit-for-tat airstrikes “at length,” and called for an end to the conflict.
    


            More details of this afternoon's Israeli strikes on Tehran are beginning to emerge, with densely populated residential areas of the Iranian capital being targeted, CNN understands.
    


            They include three busy intersections in the city: Tajrish and Quds Square, Shariati Avenue and Valiasr Square.
    


            Tajrish is home to a major shopping center, while Valiasr Street is considered one of Tehran's main thoroughfares and commercial centers.
    


            The strike on Quds Square in Tajrish hit 50 meters from Shohada Hospital, a major health center in northern Tehran.
    


            Video footage circulating on social media and geolocated by CNN shows smoke billowing into the sky following a strike in a dense area of the city near Valiasr Street.
    


            Footage taken from Quds Square shows an injured person being carried on a stretcher to a waiting emergency vehicle. The camera pans upwards to show the smashed windows of a nearby building.
    


            Other images show smoke near Tehran's Ministry of Justice building.
    


            Israel's military had previously said it was targeting military and nuclear complexes in Iran, although there are no known such complexes in these areas of the capital.
    


            Another furious wave of strikes between Israel and Iran has claimed lives in both countries, with Israel threatening to continue its attacks “for as long as it takes” to wipe out Iran's nuclear threat.
    


            “Iran will pay a very heavy price for deliberately murdering our citizens, women and children,” Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday. “We will also achieve our objectives and we will also strike them forcefully. They will feel the might of our arm.”
    


            Here's what you need to know.
    


            US President Donald Trump has pledged that Iran and Israel “will make a deal” to pause their conflict, insisting that “many calls and meetings (are) now taking place” to get both sides to halt fighting.
    


            “Iran and Israel should make a deal, and will make a deal, just like I got India and Pakistan to make,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday morning. He also cited the long-running animosity between Serbia and Kosovo, and between Egypt and Ethiopia, both of which flared up during his first term in office.
    


            “Likewise, we will have PEACE, soon, between Israel and Iran! Many calls and meetings now taking place,” Trump wrote.
    


            “I do a lot, and never get credit for anything, but that's OK, the PEOPLE understand. MAKE THE MIDDLE EAST GREAT AGAIN!”
    


            Israeli citizens have been told they can leave their shelters by the Home Front Command, but must remain nearby, after Iran launched its first daytime missile barrage since the latest conflict erupted on Friday.
    


            Israel's national emergency service Magen David Adom (MDA) said there have been no reports of injuries as of yet.
    


            Israel has continued to strike Iran throughout the day on Sunday, with reports of fresh blasts in the capital Tehran.
    


            Israel's military has detected more missiles launched from Iran on Sunday, warning citizens across the country stay near shelters.
    


            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its defensive systems were operating to intercept the threat.
    


                    “The Home Front Command has now instructed residents across the country to remain close to protected spaces. Movement in public areas should be minimized, and public gatherings must be avoided,” the IDF said in a statement.
                





            A CNN team in Tel Aviv reported sirens sounding in the city.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has again warned of the danger of Tehran having nuclear weapons as he visited the impact site of an Iranian missile strike that killed at least four people.
    


                    “We are here because we are in an existential campaign, which is clear today to all citizens of Israel. Think of what could happen if Iran had atomic weapons to drop on Israeli cities. Think of what could happen if Iran had 20,000 such missiles,” Netanyahu said in a video message from the city of Bat Yam. A stated goal of the Israeli operation is to stop Iran developing a nuclear bomb.
                





            “Iran will pay a very heavy price for deliberately murdering our citizens, women and children. We will also achieve our objectives and we will also strike them forcefully. They will feel the might of our arm,” he added.
    


            The Israeli leader urged citizens to adhere to home front command instructions when issued to shelter inside, saying, “It will save your lives.”
    


            The prime minister's visit comes after Israeli President Isaac Herzog attended the impact site to meet emergency responders and residents.
    


            Residents in the capital Tehran told CNN they felt fresh explosions shake the city on Sunday afternoon.
    


            State media reported blasts in several residential areas in the west of the city and showed plumes of smoke rising. One video showed a car on fire and the street thick with dust.
    


            The full extent of the damage or if there are casualties is unclear.
    


            The Israeli military was giving a briefing as reports emerged, with a spokesperson saying further strikes were underway.
    


            “We don't stop striking for one moment,” Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Effie Defrin said. “At this time, too, we continue to strike dozens of various additional targets in Tehran.”
    


This post has been updated. 



            Israel struck the “nuclear command center of the Iranian regime” in overnight strikes on 80 targets across Iran Saturday, a military spokesperson said, adding: “We are not pausing for a moment.”
    


            The new round of strikes on Iran hit “research and development sites used for the production of raw materials and laboratories for the development of nuclear weapons,” Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief Spokesperson Effie Defrin said at a Sunday briefing.
    


            “We also struck fuel depots near Tehran that support Iranian military infrastructure,” he said.
    


            Overall, Israel has struck 250 targets in Iran.
    


            “Even at this hour, we are continuing to strike dozens more targets in Tehran,” Defrin said.
    


            “We are deepening the damage to the nuclear program and to military capabilities, in order to disrupt and reduce the threat to the Israeli home front.”
    


            Israel's President Isaac Herzog visited the site of a deadly Iranian missile strike in Bat Yam, Central Israel, on Sunday.
    


            A residential building was directly struck at around 2.30 a.m. local time Sunday, killing at least four people including a 10-year-old boy.
    


            Dozens were injured, with rescue forces continuing to search for missing people, according to Israel's Government Press Office.
    


                    “Civilians of all ages, all backgrounds- Jews and Muslims, young and old, veteran Israelis and new immigrants, Holocaust survivors and toddlers, were unfortunately, and so sadly, killed by a horrendous Iranian attack against our cities,” Herzog said at the scene, while meeting residents and rescue workers.
                





            The president added that Israel's aim is to “change the reality in the Middle East,” and he called on the leaders of the G7 countries convening in Canada to stand behind Israel, to move the region towards “peace … dialogue… coexistence and rapprochement.”

            President Donald Trump praised the United States Army as the “greatest, fiercest and bravest fighting force” at the conclusion of a grand display of military might in the nation's capital Saturday as the Army celebrated its 250th birthday with a parade.
    


            “Time and again, America's enemies have learned that if you threaten the American people, our soldiers are coming for you. Your defeat will be certain, your demise will be final, and your downfall will be total and complete,“ Trump said Saturday, offering a stark message amid a time of conflict across the globe.
    


            “The Army keeps us free, you make us strong, and tonight, you have made all Americans very proud,” Trump told US Army soldiers gathered at the National Mall.
    


            The military parade coincided with the president's 79th birthday and took place as crowds across the country attended “No Kings” protests, denouncing what organizers described as Trump's authoritarian policies. The president was welcomed to his parade stand with pomp, circumstance and an impromptu birthday celebration. He arrived to a 21-gun salute — and as the cannons fired, members of the crowd began singing “Happy Birthday to You.”

            The parade featured several million pounds of military hardware, including dozens of M1-A1 Abrams tanks and Bradley and Stryker fighting vehicles rolling through the streets of DC, as well as Howitzers and other artillery pieces.
    


            Nearly 7,000 soldiers were set to participate in the largest military parade the city has seen in decades, which officials have estimated could cost up to $45 million. The event told the story of the Army through its 250-year history, beginning with the Revolutionary War and tracing through major conflicts.
    


            The eras of Army history were represented with vintage uniforms and equipment. As each era began, the parade emcee gave a brief history of the conflict and described the equipment.
    


            The Army celebration has been in the works for two years, though planning for the parade, which was the Trump White House's idea, began a couple of months ago. Trump's desire for a large military parade — featuring all of the military services — dates to his first term. But it was scrapped at the time amid concerns about the price tag and optics of such a display of power.
    


            Trump vowed a patriotic show unlike anything seen before and said it would take place regardless of the stormy weather expected in the nation's capital. The parade ran ahead of schedule and a few events, such as an F-22 flyover, appeared to be canceled because of the weather.
    


            While the president was focused on the military parade in DC, scores of Americans attended “No Kings” protests around the country. More than 2,000 protests across all 50 states were planned through the movement, which seeks to reject “authoritarianism, billionaire-first politics, and the militarization of our democracy.”
    


            Although the “No Kings” organizers deliberately did not hold protests in DC to avoid drawing attention to the parade, some demonstrators rallied in the nation's capital, holding signs with phrases such as “No Fascist USA” and “No Kings.”
    


            The military parade and protests have been amplified by a week of demonstrations against Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in Los Angeles and other major cities. Trump federalized 4,000 members of the California National Guard against Gov. Gavin Newsom's will, with orders to protect federal buildings and personnel amid immigration protests in Los Angeles.
    


            Some states sought to get ahead of Saturday protests by deploying their state's National Guard. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott deployed his state's this week ahead of planned protests, including a No Kings event in San Antonio on Saturday. Gov. Mike Kehoe activated Missouri's National Guard on Thursday “as a precautionary measure in reaction to recent instances of civil unrest across the country.”

A massive military parade to celebrate the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary, requested by President Donald Trump, rolled through Washington D.C. on Saturday, as opponents of the president's agenda rallied in hundreds of cities nationwide for “No Kings” protests.

What to know: 



A line of sheriff's deputies made a push toward the demonstrators who remain in front of Los Angeles city hall Saturday afternoon, continuously firing less lethal munitions. 

A majority of the group from earlier in the day has left.

Some protesters refused to leave, sitting down and yelling back “peaceful protest.”

A man wearing a black face covering and sunglasses began walking through the crowd and jostling with protesters.

A video posted online shows the man used his arms to push protesters who were surrounding him. Some in the crowd then began hitting him.

The man then pulled out the handgun, causing the crowd to scatter. He trained the gun on the crowd. A few people who remained nearby tried to de-escalate the situation.

Another video showed Arizona Department of Public Safety officers taking the man, then handcuffed, into custody as protesters cheered on. The agency declined to answer questions about the encounter.

Holding hands with his wife Melania, Trump left the stage.

Protesters stationed near the celebration of the Army's 250th birthday — which coincided with Trump's 79th — chanted as fireworks exploded overhead.

Protesters held signs including “Thank you Army shame on you Trump” and “Stop the fascist now” with a Palestinian flag being waved by one. 

Dozens of police officers stood nearby as protesters and festivalgoers yelled at each other. People leaving the Army rally walked past protesters, and the occasional “USA” chant broke out, but no confrontations were seen.

There have been several bursts of fireworks above the crowd that had gathered for Saturday's events, with several songs with patriotic undertones playing alongside.

There have also been videos with military members giving testimonials about what their service means to them.

There have been troop formations, heavy artillery displays, flyovers, musical performances and a presidential address. But now the Army's birthday parade is drawing to a close.

Fireworks are the last thing on the official schedule.

Officers fired more tear gas at protesters, surprising those who had gathered on the street and sidewalk a few blocks from a police line.

The clouds of gas wafted toward a family-friendly demonstration that has been going for hours outside City Hall. Young children covered their face with their t-shirts as those in the crowd without protective gear choked and coughed.

“We just wanted to come and support our people and we're getting tear gassed for it,” said Melissa Bran, a 28-year-old pharmacist, as she dabbed her red eyes with a wet cloth.

He's sung the song at hundreds of Trump-related events, and the singer is back performing “God Bless the U.S.A.” to help close out Saturday's events.

Clad in a blue and white sport coat, tie and dark pants, Greenwood performed the song he's sung at Trump's political rallies across the country.

“God bless the United States Army,” Greenwood said, wrapping up.

Trump can be meandering in his big rally speeches, but seemed intent on speaking with breadth—but brevity — with his remarks to celebrate the U.S. Army 250th birthday.

“There is no earthly force more powerful than the brave heart of the U.S. military or an Army Ranger paratrooper, or Green Beret,” Trump said. “They are the best. They are the finest from Bunker Hill to San Juan Hill, from Gettysburg to Guadalcanal, from Yorktown to Shiloh, and from the trenches of the Argonne to the mountains of Afghanistan, the Army has forged a legacy of unmatched courage, untold sacrifice.”

The remarks clocked in at eight minutes.

“We're the hottest country in the world right now,” the president said.

Trump rattled off anecdotes from old wars and stuck to script but did sneak in a vintage Trumpism as he boasted of the attention the United States has garnered.

“If you threaten the American people, our soldiers are coming for you.""Trump has been talking up the strength of the U.S. fighting force, saying that enemies that have challenged it have regretted doing so.

Adding that “the U.S. Army has driven bayonets into the hearts of evil empires,” Trump also said U.S. soldiers “fight, fight fight and they win, win win” — a reprise of a line regularly delivered during his 2024 campaign rallies

“Every other country celebrates their victories. It's about time America did too,” Trump said.

The military says the parade will cost between $25 million and $45 million.

It's the first time during the afternoon and evening celebrations that Trump has spoken, aside from administering the oath to new and re-enlisting soldiers. He walked out to the podium accompanied by his wife, who then went to her seat.

After Trump's remarks, the celebration-wrapping fireworks are scheduled to go off.

Vance took the podium ahead of expected remarks from Trump. The Marine veteran said the U.S. askes its military to “kick the hell out of the enemy and to come home safely.”

Vance also wished Trump a happy birthday and a happy anniversary to his own wife, Usha.

Dozens of lingering protesters in Philadelphia were trailed by police on bicycles and on motorbikes with sirens blaring as officers urged them to move away.

They eventually dispersed a few hours after the scheduled march and speeches had ended. At least three people were detained.

Army parade showcases equipment sent to UkraineBy Jonathan J. CooperSome of the equipment on display isn't just theoretical or historic. The Army has showcased weapons systems being used on the battlefield in Ukraine.

Some of the equipment on display is currently in use on the battlefield in Ukraine. The U.S. military has provided substantial support, including weapons and weapons systems from its own stockpiles, to help the Ukrainians fight a war against Russia.

These are some of the parade weapons that have been sent to Ukraine, along with the number supplied, according to the U.S. State Department.

That was Trump's comment to recruits as he swore them in to the U.S. Army. 

“Congratulations, congratulations,” he told them. “Welcome to the United States Army! And have a great life”

Many parade attendees that had been steadily moving through the National Monument lawn froze in their tracks as Trump began giving the oath. Applause and cheers erupted as he finished

Helping bring up the rear of the Army parade were hundreds of future troops, led by the band at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point including members of the Texas A&M Army Corps of Cadets. There were also new enlistees just going through Army initial entry training, cadets from the Virginia Military Institute and cadets from The Citadel in South Carolina.

The final participants include 250 brand new recruits or soldiers who are re-enlisting. 

As they reached Trump, they turned toward him and raised their right hands. Standing at a podium, Trump then swore them into service, with soldiers repeating an oath after him.

Tensions were escalating on the streets of downtown Los Angeles as police sought to disperse demonstrators, many of whom seemed caught off guard — and enlivened — by the abrupt orders to leave.

As police fired flash bangs and canisters of tear gas, protesters responded with loud fireworks and calls to “hold the line.” Volunteer medics in gas masks roamed the crowd, offering saline solution to those affected by tear gas.

Other groups of helicopters have flown along the route, including Black Hawks and Chinooks after the Apaches. Several formations flew along in quick succession.

Many attendees stopped what they were doing and pointed their phones to the sky, with the thunderous helicopters echoing beneath the low-hanging grey clouds. Of all the attractions so far, helicopters have stopped attendees in their tracks the most.

Nine of the aircraft are flying over the parade route. The attack helicopters are designed for combat and ground support.

A previously calm demonstration in downtown LA quickly turned chaotic as police on horseback charged at the crowd, striking some with wood rods and batons as they cleared the street in front of the federal building.

Officers then fired tear gas and crowd control projectiles at the large group, sending demonstrators, hot dog vendors and passing pedestrians fleeing through the street. Some have since regrouped, ignoring an LAPD dispersal order.

“It was a total 100% over-reaction. We weren't doing anything but standing around chanting peaceful protest,” said Samantha Edgerton, a 37-year-old bartender.

The band at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point will lead hundreds of future troops, including members of the Texas A&M Army Corps of Cadets, new enlistees just going through Army initial entry training, cadets from the Virginia Military Institute and cadets from The Citadel in South Carolina.

Last, 250 brand new recruits or soldiers who are re-enlisting will reach the president. As they do, they will turn toward him and raise their right hand, and Trump will swear them into service.

The military says the parade will only cost between $25 million and $45 million because several corporations are sponsoring the celebration.

Among those are some tightly connected to Trump. They include the cryptocurrency firm Coinbase, which added Trump's campaign manager to its advisory council. The technology firm Palantir was founded by billionaire Peter Thiel, who used to employ Vice President JD Vance. 

And Ultimate Fighting Championship's founder, Dana White, is a Trump ally who joined the president at the reviewing stand.

Traditional military contractors like Amazon and Lockheed Martin also sponsored the event.

A few hours after the scheduled march and speeches in Philadelphia had ended, a contingent of police officers on bicycles was monitoring and trying to disperse dozens of protesters who were still gathered in one area, and at least three people had been detained.

The small crowd — some of them wearing masks or other partial face coverings — chanted phrases like “Say it loud, say it clear, immigrants are welcome here” and “Free Palestine,” and some shouted at the officers. They carried signs with phrases including “ICE AN AGENT,” “Healthcare for all” and “The 3rd Impeachment's the charm!”

It had been anticipated that there would be dozens of helicopters flying overhead during portions of the parade dedicated to the Gulf War and global war on terror, but that didn't happen.

Low visibility and lots of clouds in the Washington area seem to have contributed to less of an aircraft presence in the parade. Some Vietnam-era helicopters were part of an earlier portion.

The Texas Department of Public Safety said one person has been arrested in connection with the threat to Democratic state lawmakers attending a rally at the state Capitol. The threat had caused state police to close the capitol grounds for several hours.

A DPS spokesperson said the person was arrested after a traffic stop in La Grange, about 65 miles (104 kilometers) east of Austin. Officials did not immediately release more details about the threat or the arrest.

One person was struck by an SUV that police say was driven recklessly through a crowd at a protest Saturday in Culpeper, Virginia.

Police say the 21-year-old driver intentionally accelerated the SUV into the crowd as protesters were leaving the event.

It's unclear whether there were any injuries. Police haven't yet identified the person who was struck by the SUV.

The rain is a slight drizzle in Washington now as the Army birthday parade crosses the one-hour mark.

Organizers had anticipated the parade in total would last about 90 minutes.

The final war portion of the parade is expected to be a thunderous, 31-minute long procession of all the heavy tanks, artillery and helicopters the Army is counting on for any near-term future conflict. That includes scores of Black Hawk helicopters, all variants of towed and self-propelled artillery, and even the HIMARS High Mobility Artillery Rocket System that has been so coveted by Ukraine as it fights Russia. 

This segment is memorializing the most recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. 

Trump has been critical of the U.S. involvement in those wars. 

The segment kicked off with a guitar riff that sounded like it was from the classic Heart song “Barracuda.”

While the World Trade Center towers were still smoldering, soldiers from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment “Night Stalkers” were packing up to launch Green Berets into a classified counterstrike in Afghanistan. That counterstrike inserted the special forces to ride on horseback alongside Northern Alliance fighters to attack the Taliban and take Mazar-e-Sharif.

Thousands gathered calmly on the lawn near the Washington Monument, in front of Trump's viewing stage, with only a few signs expressing dissent. 

A younger man held a sign that said “No Kings,” while a woman — Kathy Straus — displayed a sign criticizing the cost of the parade, arguing the money could have been used to feed veterans.

Straus traveled from Richmond to attend, saying she wasn't protesting but wanted to offer an alternative perspective to Trump supporters.

“I thought that it would be more effective to come here than go to a protest with people that think similar to me,” said Straus, who is not a supporter of Trump. She added that people haven't been rude, even the ones who disagree with her.

The parade is showcasing a variety of artillery pieces and armored vehicles. 

Helmeted soldiers riding atop vehicles are smiling and waving to the crowd. One made a heart with his hands.

Troops from the 10th Mountain Division deployed more than 20 times to Afghanistan and Iraq as part of the Global War on Terror, following the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

As they march past, the160th SOAR will fly overhead in the three helicopter types they operate – the OH-6 “Little Bird,” the MH-60 Black Hawk and the MH-47 Chinook.



It was the first time that the Marines have appeared at a demonstration since they were deployed to the city on Friday with the stated mission of defending federal property.

Dozens of Marines stood shoulder-to-shoulder in full combat gear, hands on their rifles, beside other law enforcement, including Department of Homeland Security officers and the National Guard. Directly in front of them, hundreds of protesters jeered in English and Spanish, telling the federal troops to go home.

The event got started well ahead of schedule, and it's speeding right along, as ominous weather is still predicted for the Washington region.

In its first 40 minutes, the parade sped through more than 200 years of U.S. Army history, from its inception in 1775 to 1991's Gulf War era.

Compared with anticipated timelines laid out in advance, the parade's timing is now nearly half an hour ahead of schedule. In all, it's been estimated to last a total of about an hour and a half.

Though it looks like a tank, it's technically not. 

Bradleys have been used since the 1960s and were used extensively during the U.S. wars in Iraq. More recently, the U.S. has given some to the Ukrainian military to assist in its fight against Russia.

A howitzer is any type of angled, short barrel gun that is able to launch projectiles high into the air and over long distances.

It had been speculated that bad weather would preempt flyovers during the parade, but at least seven Cayuse, Cobra and Iroquois helicopters were seen in the air over the parade route.

The Iroquois, or legendary UH-1 “Huey,” was used for everything from troop transport to medevac to supplies.

The artillery and armor were key to that quick Gulf War victory, including eight Bradley Fighting Vehicles, two M109 Paladins - a self-propelled howitzer that weighs about half of what an Abrams does - and six M119 lightweight towed howitzers.

America's lightning-fast 100-hour race across Iraq and defeat of Iraq in February 1991 is being represented by troops whose units led the way – the 1st Infantry Division based at Fort Cavazos, Texas, soon to be renamed Fort Hood.

The armored division may be best remembered for racing across the desert in M1-Abrams tanks – and this will be the first time in the parade we see the massive, 60-ton Abrams roll past.

In the battle of 73 Easting, nine U.S. M1-Abrams tanks led by then-Army Capt. HR McMaster were outnumbered by Iraqi tanks – but prevailed, destroying an estimated 50 Iraqi tanks and vehicles.

Trump is expected to speak as part of the Army semi-quincentennial that happens to fall on his birthday. There are bipartisan concerns about the cost of the spectacle, which this civilian commander in chief has pitched as a way to celebrate U.S. power.

But with just 6,600-plus troops marching, it's hardly the biggest to be held in America.

President Andrew Johnson appears to still hold that record, set when his “Grand Review of the Armies” marked the end of the Civil War. That show of force in 1865, meant to salve a war-weary nation, included 145,000 soldiers marching down Pennsylvania Avenue.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Masses of demonstrators packed into streets, parks and plazas across the United States on Saturday to protest President Donald Trump, marching through downtowns and small towns, blaring anti-authoritarian chants mixed with support for protecting democracy and immigrant rights.

Organizers of the “No Kings” demonstrations said millions had marched in hundreds of events. Governors across the U.S. had urged calm and vowed no tolerance for violence, while some mobilized the National Guard ahead of marchers gathering.

Confrontations were isolated. But police in Los Angeles, where protests over federal immigration enforcement raids erupted a week earlier and sparked demonstrations across the country, used tear gas and crowd-control munitions to clear out protesters after the formal event ended. Officers in Portland also fired tear gas and projectiles to disperse a crowd that protested in front of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building well into the evening.

And in Salt Lake City, Utah, police were investigating a shooting during a march downtown that left one person critically injured. Three people were taken into custody, including a man believed to be the shooter, who also suffered a gunshot wound, according to Police Chief Brian Redd.

Redd said it was too early to tell if the shooting was politically motivated and whether those involved knew each other. The shooter appeared to be walking alongside the group of thousands who were marching, he added. Video feeds showed demonstrators running for safety as gunshots rang out.

Huge, boisterous crowds marched, danced, drummed, and chanted shoulder-to-shoulder in New York, Denver, Chicago, Austin and Los Angeles, some behind “no kings” banners. Atlanta's 5,000-capacity event quickly reached its limit, with thousands more gathered outside barriers to hear speakers in front of the state Capitol. Officials in Seattle estimated that more than 70,000 people attended the city's largest rally downtown, the Seattle Times reported.

Trump was in Washington for a military parade marking the Army's 250th anniversary that coincides with the president's birthday. About 200 protesters assembled in northwest Washington's Logan Circle and chanted “Trump must go now” before erupting in cheers. A larger-than-life puppet of Trump — a caricature of the president wearing a crown and sitting on a golden toilet — was wheeled through the crowd.

In some places, organizers handed out little American flags while others flew their flags upside down, a sign of distress. Mexican flags, which have become a fixture of the Los Angeles protests against immigration raids, also made an appearance at some demonstrations Saturday.

In Culpepper, Virginia, police said one person was struck by an SUV when a 21-year-old driver intentionally accelerated his SUV into the crowd as protesters were leaving a rally. The driver was charged with reckless driving.

The demonstrations come on the heels of the protests over the federal immigration enforcement raids that began last week and Trump ordering the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, where protesters blocked a freeway and set cars on fire. 

“Today, across red states and blue, rural towns and major cities, Americans stood in peaceful unity and made it clear: we don't do kings,” the No Kings Coalition said in a statement Saturday afternoon after many events had ended.

Thousands gathered downtown, where organizers handed out small American flags and people carried protest signs saying “fight oligarchy” and “deport the mini-Mussolinis.”

Karen Van Trieste, a 61-year-old nurse who drove up from Maryland, said she grew up in Philadelphia and wanted to be with a large group of people showing her support.

“I just feel like we need to defend our democracy,” she said. She is concerned about the Trump administration's layoffs of staff at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the fate of immigrant communities and Trump trying to rule by executive order, she said.

A woman wearing a foam Statue of Liberty crown brought a speaker system and led an anti-Trump sing-along, changing the words “young man” in the song “Y.M.C.A.” to “con man.”

”I am what the successful American dream looks like,” said C.C. Téllez, an immigrant from Bolivia who attended the protest. “I've enjoyed great success here in the United States, and I've also contributed heavily to my community. And if there was space for me, I think there's a way for everybody else to belong here as well.”

Thousands gathered in front of City Hall, waving signs and listening to a Native American drum circle before marching through the streets.

As protesters passed National Guard troops or U.S. Marines stationed at various buildings, most interactions were friendly, with demonstrators giving fist bumps or posing for selfies. But others chanted “shame” or “go home” at the troops.

Amid signs reading “They fear us don't back down California” and “We carry dreams not danger, ” one demonstrator carried a 2-foot-tall (60-centimeter) Trump pinata on a stick, with a crown on his head and sombrero hanging off his back. Another hoisted a huge helium-filled orange baby balloon with blond hair styled like Trump's.

A few blocks from City Hall, protesters gathered in front of the downtown federal detention center being guarded by a line of Marines and other law enforcement. It was the first time that the Marines, in combat gear and holding rifles, have appeared at a demonstration since they were deployed to city on Friday with the stated mission of defending federal property.

Peter Varadi, 54, said he voted for Trump last November for “economic reasons.” Now, for the first time in his life, he is protesting, waving a Mexican and U.S. combined flag.

“I voted for Donald Trump, and now I regret that, because he's taken this fascism to a new level,” Varadi said. “It's Latinos now. Who's next? It's gays. Blacks after that. They're coming for everybody.”

Even after the formal event ended, the downtown streets were packed with a jubilant crowd as people danced to salsa music and snacked on hot dogs and ice cream bought from vendors, many of whom are Latino immigrants. But the previously calm demonstration turned confrontational as police on horseback moved into the crowd and struck some people with wood rods and batons as they cleared the street in front of the federal building. 

Marchers in the crowd that stretched for blocks along Fifth Avenue had diverse reasons for coming, including anger over Trump's immigration policies, support for the Palestinian people and outrage over what they said was an erosion of free speech rights.

But there were patriotic symbols, too. Leah Griswold, 32, and Amber Laree, 59, who marched in suffragette white dresses, brought 250 American flags to hand out to people in the crowd.

“Our mothers who came out, fought for our rights, and now we're fighting for future generations as well,” Griswold said.

Some protesters held signs denouncing Trump while others banged drums.

“We're here because we're worried about the existential crisis of this country and the planet and our species,” said Sean Kryston, 28.

Gov. Tim Walz and law enforcement encouraged people not to attend rallies “out of an abundance of caution” following the shootings of the Democratic state lawmakers. 

Dozens of events were canceled, but tens of thousands still turned out for demonstrations in Duluth, Rochester and St. Paul, which included a march to the state Capitol. Walz canceled his scheduled appearance at the St. Paul event.

Authorities said the suspect had “No Kings” flyers in his car and writings mentioning the names of the victims as well as other lawmakers and officials, though they could not say if he had any other specific targets.

Seda Heng, 29, of Rochester, said she was heartbroken by the shootings, but still wanted to join the rally there. “These people are trying to do what they can for their communities, for the state, for the nation,” Heng told the Minnesota Star-Tribune.

Crowds cheered anti-Trump speakers in Charlotte's First Ward Park before marching, chanting “No kings. No crowns. We will not bow down.” 

Marchers stretched for blocks, led by a group of people holding a giant Mexican flag and bystanders cheering and clapping along the way.

Jocelyn Abarca, a 21-year-old college student, said the protest was a chance to “speak for what's right” after mass deportations and Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles.

“If we don't stop it now, it's just going to keep getting worse,” she said.

Naomi Mena said she traveled an hour to demonstrate in Charlotte to represent her “friends and family who sadly can't have a voice out in public now” to stay safe.

A rally at the Texas Capitol in Austin went off as planned despite state police briefly shutting down the building and the surrounding grounds after authorities said they received a “credible threat” to Democratic state lawmakers who were to attend. 

Dozens of state troopers swarmed through the grounds about four hours before the event, but the area was later opened and the rally started on time. The building remained closed.

The Department of Public Safety later said one person was taken into custody “in connection with the threats made against state lawmakers” after a traffic stop in La Grange, Texas, about 65 miles (105 kilometers) east of Austin. State police did not detail the threat or immediately identify the person, but said there was no additional active threat.

A demonstration of hundreds of people opened to “War Pigs” by Black Sabbath playing over a sound system on the state Capitol lawn in Jackson.

“A lot of stuff that's going on now is targeting people of color, and to see so many folks out here that aren't black or brown fighting for the same causes that I'm here for, it makes me very emotional,” said Tony Cropper, who traveled from Tennessee to attend the protest.

Some people wore tinfoil crowns atop their heads. Others held signs inviting motorists to “Honk if you never text war plans.”

Melissa Johnson said she drove an hour-and-a-half to Jackson to protest because “we are losing the thread of democracy in our country.”

Earlier in the day, thousands of protesters lined the streets in downtown Portland for several blocks, waving signs as passing cars honked in support. They marched around the city draped in American flags to the beat of drums and music.

By late afternoon, a small group of demonstrators amassed across the river to protest in front of an ICE office where three people were arrested Wednesday night after starting a small fire against the building, police said.

Federal immigration officers fired tear gas, flash bangs and rubber bullets in an effort to clear out the remaining protesters in the evening. Some protesters threw water bottles back and tended to each other's wounds. The police department wrote on X that the event was declared a riot.

At least two people were detained and taken inside the federal immigration building.

The grand military parade that President Donald Trump had been wanting for eight years kicked off Saturday with tanks, troops and a 21-gun salute.

U.S. President Donald Trump took the stage on Saturday to address the crowd attending the Army's 250th Birthday celebration, which featured a parade showcasing U.S. military equipment earlier in the day.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The grand military parade that President Donald Trump had been wanting for years barreled down Constitution Avenue on Saturday with tanks, troops and a 21-gun salute, playing out against a counterpoint of protests around the country by those who decried the U.S. leader as a dictator and would-be king.

The Republican president, on his 79th birthday, sat on a special viewing stand south of the White House to watch the display of American military might, which began early and moved swiftly as light rain fell and clouds shrouded the Washington Monument. The procession, with more than 6,000 soldiers and 128 Army tanks, was one Trump tried to make happen in his first term after seeing such an event in Paris in 2017, but the plans never came together until the parade was added to an event recognizing the Army's 250th anniversary. 

“Every other country celebrates their victories. It's about time America did too,” Trump declared in brief remarks at the parade's end.

The president praised the strength of the military's fighting forces and said U.S. soldiers “fight, fight fight and they win, win win” — putting a new twist on a line that Trump regularly delivered during his 2024 campaign rallies after he survived an assassination attempt.

Early in the evening's pageantry, the Army's Golden Knights parachute team descended from overcast skies toward the reviewing stand. The team had been scheduled to appear at the end of the parade, but jumped earlier than planned in the drizzly skies above the National Mall.




At times, Trump stood and saluted as troops marched past the reviewing stand. But attendance appeared to fall far short of early predictions that as many as 200,000 people would attend the festival and parade. There were large gaps between viewers near the Washington Monument on a day when steamy weather and the threat of thunderstorms could have dampened turnout.

Hours before the parade started, demonstrators turned out in streets and parks around the nation to sound off against the Republican president. They criticized Trump for using the military to respond to people protesting his deportation efforts and for the muscular military show in the U.S. capital.

The daylong display of America's Army came as Trump has shown his willingness to use the nation's military might in ways other U.S. presidents have typically avoided. In the last week, he has activated the California National Guard over the governor's objections and dispatched the U.S. Marines to provide security during Los Angeles protests related to immigration raids, prompting a state lawsuit to stop the deployments.

As armored vehicles rolled down the street in front of the president, on the other side of the country, the Marines who Trump deployed to Los Angeles appeared at a demonstration for the first time, standing guard outside a federal building. Dozens of Marines stood shoulder to shoulder in full combat gear beside the National Guard, Homeland Security officers and other law enforcement. Hundreds of protesters facing them jeered in English and Spanish, telling the troops to go home.

A previously calm demonstration in downtown Los Angeles turned chaotic when police on horseback charged at the crowd, striking some with rods and batons as they cleared the street in front of the federal building and fired tear gas and crowd control projectiles. 

In Washington, hundreds protesting Trump carried signs with messages that included “Where's the due process?” and “No to Trump's fascist military parade” as they marched toward the White House. 

A larger-than-life puppet of Trump was wheeled through the crowd, a caricature of the president wearing a crown and sitting on a golden toilet.

Other protesters waved pride flags and hoisted signs, some with pointed messages such as “I prefer crushed ICE,” referring to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Other messages included “The invasion was HERE Jan. 6th, NOT in L.A.” and “Flip me off if you're a FASCIST.”

“No Kings” rallies unfolded in hundreds of cities, designed to counter what organizers said were Trump's plans to feed his ego on his 79th birthday and Flag Day. Organizers said they picked the name to support democracy and speak out against what they call the authoritarian actions of the Trump administration.

Meanwhile, on the National Mall, a display of armored vehicles, helicopters and military-grade equipment was set up to commemorate the Army's birthday. Vendors outside the Army festival sold gear marking the military milestone. Others hawked Trump-themed merchandise.

Larry Stallard, a retired American Airlines pilot, said he traveled to Washington from Kansas City for the weekend “to see the military and see Trump.”

Stallard, who voted for Trump, said it was “hard to believe” people were upset about the cost of the event when “they blow that in 10 seconds on things that we don't even need.”

Doug Haynes, a Navy veteran who voted for Trump, attended the daylong festival to celebrate the Army's 250th birthday, but said the parade “was a little over the top.”

Pointing at a nearby tank, Haynes said that having them roll down the street is a “very bold statement to the world, perhaps.”

The parade was added just two months ago to the long-planned celebration of the Army's birthday and has drawn criticism for its price tag of up to $45 million and the possibility that the lumbering tanks could tear up city streets. The Army has taken a variety of steps to protect the streets, including laying metal plates along the route. 

About 6 in 10 Americans said Saturday's parade was “not a good use” of government money. The vast majority of people, 78%, said they neither approve nor disapprove of the parade overall, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. 

Kathy Straus traveled from Richmond, Virginia, to attend the parade, carrying a sign criticizing its cost and arguing the money could have been used to feed veterans. 

“I thought that it would be more effective to come here than go to a protest with people that think similar to me,” said Straus. 

The parade wound down Constitution Avenue, lined with security fencing and barriers. A flyover of military aircraft included World War II-era planes, including a B-25 Mitchell bomber, and Army helicopters flew low over the crowd, below the top of the Washington Monument. Mounted soldiers from the 1st Cavalry Division made an appearance — horses once played a crucial role in warfare, but today they're mostly used in ceremonial events like today's parade.

Trump swore in 250 new recruits and returning soldiers into service, with soldiers repeating an oath after him.

“Welcome to the United States Army! And have a great life,” Trump said to them afterward.

Country music singer Warren Zeiders performed, as did “God Bless the U.S.A.” singer Lee Greenwood. The event was capped off by a fireworks show.

It appeared that plans to have U.S. Air Force fighter jets fly over were scrapped because of the weather.

Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., and Fatima Goss Graves, the CEO of the Women's Law Center, square off during a DOGE hearing on protecting women's sports.

EXCLUSIVE: Two USA Fencing board of directors members are suing the other six at-large director members, alleging chair Damien Lehfeldt made false statements to congress at a May 7 Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) subcommittee hearing on transgender athletes. 

The lawsuit, which seeks to have Lehfeldt removed as USA Fencing chair, was filed on USA Fencing's behalf by the two plaintiff members.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) (R) speak about an alleged screenshot from the Instagram of USA Fencing board director Damien Lehfeldt during the hearing on ""Unfair Play: Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports"" held by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Subcommittee at the U.S. Capitol on May 7, 2025, in Washington, D.C.  (Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)

The plaintiffs, Andrey Geva and Abdel Salem, each have long ties to the sport and organization. 

Geva is a former U.S. National Coach who led the U.S. Women's Épée Team at the 2016 and 2020 Olympics, before being elected to the board in 2024. Abdel competed for Egypt in individual and team épée events at the 1984 Summer Olympics, the former head fencing coach of the U.S. Air Force Academy, and in 1996 was named the U.S. Olympic Committee Coach of the Year.

Now, they are taking the organization to court after alleging Lefheldt falsely announced Geva's resignation from the board at a meeting on June 7, and over several allegations involving the May 7 Doge hearing.

The May hearing was called in response to a viral incident where women's fencer Stephanie Turner kneeled to protest a transgender opponent, and was subsequently punished by USA Fencing. Lefheldt was the lone figure to testify on behalf of the organization. 

The lawsuit claims Lehfeldt made ""false and misleading claims"" at the hearing, which now risk the organization being declassified as a national governing body (NGB). 

""Defendant Lehfeldt's non-corporative demeanor in bad faith and untruthful and misleading statements at the congressional hearing on May 7, [2025] has prompted the Congress to consider decertifying USFA as an NGB, thus potentially risking Team USA's qualification in the 2028 Los Angeles Summer Olympic Game,"" the lawsuit states.

""His lies have alienated thousands of members in the fencing community who have provided more than 90% of USFA's revenues."" 

Geva claims he attempted to speak at the hearing as well, but alleges he faced ""threats"" aimed to ""deter"" him from it. Geva ultimately submitted a letter to Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on May 2, expressing ""opinion on biological men's advantage over women in fencing."" Cruz's office had recently opened an investigation into USA Fencing over its transgender eligibility policy after the Turner incident. 

The letter was then referenced during the DOGE hearing by subcommittee chairwoman Marjorie Taylor-Greene. 

""'Transgender women's fencers have significant advantages in women's competitions,' he writes,"" Greene said during the hearing, reading from Geva's letter. 

The lawsuit alleges Geva was then messaged by a fellow board member, blaming him for his honest personal opinion, and then two board members called for a ""special board meeting intended to remove or otherwise discipline Plaintiff Geva.""

WHO IS STEPHANIE TURNER? WOMEN'S FENCER WHO KNELT TO PROTEST TRANS OPPONENT AND IGNITED GLOBAL AWARENESS

USA Fencing has acknowledged the lawsuit in a statement to Fox News Digital. 

""USA Fencing proudly serves its members — athletes, coaches, referees and clubs — across our community with absolute transparency and integrity. This derivative lawsuit misrepresents our organization, and we will vigorously defend the organization in court; any attempt to disparage them will be addressed appropriately,"" the statement read.

""Because litigation is ongoing, we cannot discuss details. Our focus remains unwavering: advancing fencing nationwide, supporting every member's success, and upholding the values of the Olympic and Paralympic movement.""

The organization has been under immense national scrutiny following the release of the footage of Turner's protest on April 2. 

Lefheldt's testimony at the May 7 hearing only intensified the criticism. 

Lehfeldt, who was subpoenaed and did not come voluntarily, made elevated the controversy ahead of the hearing with a series of Instagram stories that were later blown up and used against him on the committee floor. In one post, which went viral before the hearing, he responded to a question that asked whether he was ""okay"" with putting female fencers at a disadvantage with a simple, brash answer: ""Yeah."" 

Then, during the hearing, Lehfeldt admitted multiple times he regretted answering that way and admitted the question required a ""more-nuanced"" response. 

At one point during the hearing, Lefheldt confessed to falsifying an email from a fictitious fencing mother ""Dorothy"" who disagreed with him and called those members with similar view of ""Dorothy"" ""grand wizard"" of Ku Klux Klan.

""It was a poor attempt at humor,"" Lehfeldt said. 

Rep. Tim Burhcett, R-Tenn., asked Lehfeldt whether he would let his daughter fence against ""a man."" Lehfeldt suggested he would allow it while boasting about his organization's safety precautions. 

""As long as the competitor has met all the hormonal requirements and complies with the policy, I would be okay with it,"" Lehfeldt said. 

Later in the hearing, Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., suggested that Lehfeldt was ""not"" a man for his organization's gender eligibility policy. 

""Real men protect women, you're not one,"" Mace said. 

Mace even asked Lehfeldt to simply apologize to Turner for punishing the fencer, to which the chair declined and pointed out that Turner received a black card for her refusal. 

Turner told Fox News Digital after the DOGE hearing that she would work to lobby leadership changes to USA Fencing after stepping away from the sport. 

""I'm going to be pushing for people to resign, to be honest. I'd like to see some people resign for the comments that they've made, especially publicly, ones that are harassing and meant to humiliate concerned women, mothers and daughters,"" Turner said. 

Now, two members on the board of directors have joined that cause.

Amid the ongoing scrutiny, USA Fencing's board voted to amend its current policy that prioritized states with LGBTQ-friendly laws for host sites for competitions and a policy that may have prevented the playing of the national anthem at some events, at its June 7 meeting.

The previous policies became one of the organization's biggest points of criticism after Turner's viral protest. 

USA Fencing has declined to explain the motivation behind the changes. 

""It would be inappropriate for staff to speculate on the personal motivations of USA Fencing's volunteer Board of Directors,"" a USA Fencing spokesperson told Fox News Digital.

Former U.S. men's soccer star Stu Holden tells Fox News Digital what areas of concern the U.S. will address ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

Former USMNT player Stu Holden identified one big issue the team needs to figure out before the World Cup begins next year. 

Holden, 39, said the team needs to figure out which players will be on the field. 

""I think the biggest issue for the USMNT is to figure out who are the 11 guys who are going to step out on that field on June 12, 2026, that can inspire people and get results. There has not been anything in two years since the World Cup in Qatar that has made me feel that we have taken any strides forward,"" Holden told Fox News Digital.

""I think that is the goal with developing and the amount of investment we have put into the game in this country is that I haven't seen anything that makes me think we are going to do anything that we haven't done before."" 

""It is about this group of players, not just making us believe, but making themselves believe but making themselves believe by getting some results and building some momentum heading into that moment. So that when they step out on that field, they know they can get the job done.""

In the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, the United States were knocked out in the Round of 16. One of the tournaments USMNT has to determine their starting 11 players for the World Cup is the Gold Cup. 

However, USMNT's best player, Christian Pulisic, is not playing in the Gold Cup, which Holden said is a big deal. 

""I think it's a big deal, because I think anytime the United States national team is playing I want the best 23, 11, whatever it is, American players playing on those fields in those moments. And I also want players that are excited to play and represent their national team in every moment,"" Holden said.

""And it is not just a, ‘Eh, maybe I will come in this time.' So, I think that is what we are missing. He is our best player and I want to see our best player on the field. And when he is on the field, it sets the tone and makes other people want to be a part of it as well. It is instrumental in building a culture and that is what I think this team right now is really lacking.""

Pulisic will be back with USMNT for the World Cup, but Holden has one player that fans should look out for other than Pulisic.

""I think Weston Mckennie is a player that always excites me because he just has some really raw talent. He is an excellent athlete but he is also just a gamer. In some of the biggest moments he turns up with a goal,"" Holden said.

""My hope is he's a guy who takes and shoulders some of that responsibility for the World Cup next year and be a guy who can really create some moments. We can't just have one good player, we need to have four to five of our top players playing at their absolute maximum for this team to do something special.""

Holden played for the USMNT from 2008-2013 and the midfielder scored three goals in his tenure.

The 39-year-old is currently a soccer analyst for Fox Sports and is excited for the world to see the soccer culture that the United States has built. 

""I am excited, as a guy who lives in L.A. now and has for ten years, for people to come and visit L.A. and see the soccer culture that we built here. I think back to the final that we built here in 1994 (when the World Cup was last in the United States),"" Holden said.

""The other part I am excited for is, I have two young kids, and I can't wait to take them to games in our own backyard, and let them see the best players, the biggest teams, and experience that, because that is how we inspire the next generation of people. So, I am excited about those fans that will be inspired to be a part of our game going forward.""

The technology combines direct air capture with on-site fuel synthesis, providing fossil-free gasoline.

Recently, Aircela, a fuel company headquartered in New York, publicly demonstrated a machine in Manhattan that produces gasoline directly from air. 

The event attracted city and state officials, investors and energy professionals who witnessed the launch of this compact, refrigerator-sized unit. 

Aircela's technology combines direct air capture with on-site fuel synthesis, providing fossil-free gasoline that is fully compatible with existing engines and infrastructure.

Aircela's air-to-gasoline machine  (Aircela)

Led by co-founder and CEO Eric Dahlgren (pictured on the right below), Aircela has developed a machine that produces real, engine-ready gasoline from just air and water, powered by renewable electricity and advanced chemical processes. The technology is based on direct air capture research, notably the work of physicist Klaus Lackner (shown on the left below), and is designed for easy installation in residential, commercial and industrial settings.

The process begins by drawing in ambient air and using a water-based solution containing potassium hydroxide to efficiently capture carbon dioxide. As air flows through a specially designed chamber, the liquid sorbent absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which is then regenerated for repeated use. Next, the system uses renewable electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis. The hydrogen is retained for the fuel synthesis process, while the oxygen is safely released into the environment.

The captured carbon dioxide and generated hydrogen are then combined to create methanol, which is subsequently converted into gasoline using established chemical processes. The resulting gasoline contains no sulfur, ethanol or heavy metals, making it fully compatible with existing engines and infrastructure. Each Aircela unit can produce approximately one gallon of gasoline per day from around 22 pounds of captured carbon dioxide with a storage capacity of up to 17 gallons. This innovative machine enables users to generate fossil-free gasoline on site using only air, water and renewable electricity.

Unlike traditional synthetic fuel projects that rely on large, centralized plants, Aircela's approach is modular and distributed. Each unit can produce gasoline on site, making it suitable for off-grid locations, ports, islands or emergency situations. This design allows users to access cleaner fuel without the need to alter their vehicles or fueling routines.

Aircela has secured funding from notable investors, including Chris Larsen, founder of Ripple Labs' Jeff Ubben, a board member at ExxonMobil; and Maersk Growth, the venture capital arm of A.P. Moller-Maersk. During the demonstration, Morten Bo Christiansen, Maersk's head of energy transition, emphasized the machine's potential to support global efforts to reduce carbon emissions, particularly in the shipping and logistics industries.

The process developed by Aircela is intended to be carbon neutral, as the carbon dioxide released when the gasoline is burned is balanced by the amount captured during production. The gasoline works with current engines and fueling systems, so there is no need for costly upgrades. Distributed production reduces reliance on centralized refineries and long supply chains. In addition, the fuel's purity, free from sulfur and additives, helps lower harmful emissions beyond just carbon dioxide.

Aircela plans to begin initial deployments of its machines in the fall of 2025, with a focus on off-grid, commercial and industrial users. The company's goal is to increase production, reduce costs and make the technology widely available. While the current output is modest, Aircela aims to provide a practical, climate-aligned alternative to fossil fuels that does not require people to change their vehicles or daily habits.

Aircela's gasoline-from-air machine shows that sometimes the best solutions are the ones that fit right into our daily routines. Instead of requiring new cars or major changes, this technology lets people keep using what they already have, just with cleaner fuel. Watching carbon pulled from the air and turned into gasoline on the spot feels like a practical step toward a more sustainable future. 

As Aircela gets ready to roll out these machines, it will be interesting to see how this approach might help ease the transition to cleaner energy for everyone.

Democrats have a daunting messaging task that's nearly as colossal as President Donald Trump's sprawling tax and spending bill.

The more than 1,000-page legislation, which touches on everything from Medicaid and taxes to artificial intelligence, food stamps, and gun suppressors, has Democrats scrambling to turn the public against a smorgasbord of policies they hope might derail delicate negotiations among Republicans.

Democrats are on a public relations blitz of near-daily press events to cycle through provisions tucked into the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the backbone of Trump's domestic policy agenda.

“This bill is chock full of garbage, so the more people know about it, the better,” Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI) told the Washington Examiner. “And I don't think we should be so fussy about one person talking about [the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] and one person talking about tax cuts and one person talking about Medicaid. It all works, and we should scream it from the rooftops.”

In the last week, Senate Democrats hosted press conferences on the bill's repeal of former President Joe Biden's clean energy tax credits, extension of Trump's first-term tax cuts that expire this year, crackdown on illegal immigration enforcement, policy effects on women, Medicaid cuts, and tax cuts for firearm suppressors. Some issues, such as Medicaid, were the subject of more than one event.

Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) sees the portions that “resonate with the public” the most as changes to Medicaid and Obamacare that are projected to result in 16 million fewer people with health insurance, potential rural hospital closures from the Medicaid portion, and the scaling back of food stamp eligibility.

“There's so many items in this 1,000-page bill,” Durbin told the Washington Examiner. “Those three things, I think, are the top visible issues. But there's so many others.”

In the House, where Republicans passed their version of the bill last month, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) previewed a “save our hospitals” week of action next week when the chamber is on recess. The Senate is in session and will continue to tweak the House bill.

“Hospitals will close if Republicans are successful in passing the GOP tax scam,” Jeffries told reporters, referencing proposed changes to provider tax credits that hospitals receive for Medicaid patients. “That is incredibly disturbing. Lives will be lost.”

Changes to Medicaid benefits and new work requirements will mean higher healthcare costs and less eligibility, creating a flash point in the broader debate over the bill. Democrats see the government-run healthcare program for lower-income Americans as a pillar of their messaging strategy, along with opposing the extension of tax cuts that are projected to benefit wealthier earners.

While Democrats have been unsuccessful in derailing Republicans so far, there's evidence they could be chipping away at the overall proposal's popularity, particularly Medicaid. Polling shows that the vast majority of Americans agree with the Democrats' position on the program.

A Quinnipiac University survey this week showed that 53% of voters oppose the legislation. Less than a third support it, and 20% have no opinion. Medicaid is overwhelmingly popular, with 87% opposing cuts, including 77% of Republicans.

Medicaid is a point of major friction for Republicans in states with high Medicaid enrollment and who oppose changes that would essentially cut benefits or jeopardize hospital funding. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), the program's loudest conservative defender, vowed Friday to remain “in hourly contact with leadership” until changes are made.

Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) used a rare joint press conference to offer a tongue-in-cheek “second chance” to House Republicans, urging them to demand changes for items they were previously unaware of but now align with Democrats in opposing them. Schumer cited the bill's repeal of green energy tax credits as a leading example.

GOP RALLIES AROUND ESCALATING BIDEN INVESTIGATIONS AS PARTY FEUDS ELSEWHERE ON POLICY

“If they really mean what they say, and they want to change the bill, this is their golden opportunity,” Schumer said. “Don't throw the key away. Don't shrug your shoulders a second time.”

Republican leaders hope to muscle the Senate's revised version through the party's slim majorities in both chambers and send it to the president's desk by the July 4 break.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

At least 13 Israelis have now died in the hostilities between the Jewish state and Iran that began last week. 

Iranian strikes carried out overnight against Israel took at least 10 lives, according to Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service. 

The fatalities come as the two countries have exchanged a barrage of missiles and attacks over the past three days, with the Israel Defense Forces carrying out overnight strikes on 80 targets focused on wiping out Tehran's energy and defense infrastructure on Saturday, with Iran's U.N. ambassador saying 78 Iranians had been killed in Israeli strikes.

President Donald Trump said in response to the latest exchange that the United States had not helped Israel carry out the attacks and urged Iran to come back to the negotiating table to sign a nuclear agreement that would avoid further destruction.

“The U.S. had nothing to do with the attack on Iran, tonight. If we are attacked in any way, shape or form by Iran, the full strength and might of the U.S. Armed Forces will come down on you at levels never seen before. However, we can easily get a deal done between Iran and Israel, and end this bloody conflict!!!” the president said in a post to Truth Social. 

The conflict began Thursday when Israel conducted a wide-ranging attack on Iran's nuclear and military capabilities hours after the United Nations's nuclear watchdog passed a resolution declaring Tehran in noncompliance with its nuclear safeguards obligations for the first time in two decades. The operation killed much of Iran's military command and its leading nuclear scientists, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps's entire air force command. 

“Operation Rising Lion,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, seeks to “roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival.”

Iran responded by sending a barrage of missiles into Israeli territory, some of which struck a four-story building over the weekend, resulting in four deaths and 24 injuries in the northern district of Israel.

Another one of Tehran's strikes hit a residential apartment building in Bat Yam, near Tel Aviv, killing at least six people, including two children.

“Iran will pay a very heavy price for deliberately murdering our citizens, women and children. We will also achieve our objectives and we will also strike them forcefully. They will feel the might of our arm,” Netanyahu said in response to the attacks. 

“We are here because we are in an existential campaign, which is clear today to all citizens of Israel. Think of what could happen if Iran had atomic weapons to drop on Israeli cities. Think of what could happen if Iran had 20,000 such missiles,” the Israeli prime minister added. 

Tehran's strikes led Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz to warn the regime on Saturday that if attacks on Israel, largely in civilian areas, aren't halted, “Tehran will burn.” Israel followed up on the threat with attacks on two of Iran's critical oil production facilities. 

As Israel's most powerful ally, the U.S. has tried for years to mediate an end to Iran's nuclear program. Trump sought to solve the conflict via diplomatic means and in early April offered Iran 60 days to make a deal or else face “dire consequences.” 

‘TEHRAN IS BURNING,' ISRAEL DEFENSE MINISTER SAYS AFTER OIL DEPOT STRIKES

That deadline came and went unmet on the day before Israel decided to attempt to wipe out Iran's nuclear and military capabilities on its own despite nuclear talks between Iranian and U.S. negotiators being scheduled for Sunday.

Everyone wants to be a girl dad now.

Perhaps the oldest, most pernicious form of human bias is that of men toward women. It often started at the moment of birth. In ancient Athens, at a public ceremony called the amphidromia, fathers would inspect a newborn and decide whether it would be part of the family, or be cast away. One often socially acceptable reason for abandoning the baby: It was a girl. 

Female infanticide has been distressingly common in many societies — and its practice is not just ancient history. In 1990, the Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen looked at birth ratios in Asia, North Africa, and China and calculated that more than 100 million women were essentially “missing” — meaning that, based on the normal ratio of boys to girls at birth and the longevity of both genders, there was a huge missing number of girls who should have been born, but weren't. 

A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world.

Sen's estimate came before the truly widespread adoption of ultrasound tests that could determine the sex of a fetus in utero — which actually made the problem worse, leading to a wave of sex-selective abortions. These were especially common in countries like India and China; the latter's one-child policy and old biases made families desperate for their one child to be a boy. The Economist has estimated that since 1980 alone, there have been approximately 50 million fewer girls born worldwide than would naturally be expected, which almost certainly means that roughly that nearly all of those girls were aborted for no other reason than their sex. The preference for boys was a bias that killed in mass numbers.

But in one of the most important social shifts of our time, that bias is changing. In a great cover story earlier this month, The Economist reported that the number of annual excess male births has fallen from a peak of 1.7 million in 2000 to around 200,000, which puts it back within the biologically standard birth ratio of 105 boys for every 100 girls. Countries that once had highly skewed sex ratios — like South Korea, which saw almost 116 boys born for every 100 girls in 1990 — now have normal or near-normal ratios. 

Altogether, The Economist estimated that the decline in sex preference at birth in the past 25 years has saved the equivalent of 7 million girls. That's comparable to the number of lives saved by anti-smoking efforts in the US. So how, exactly, have we overcome a prejudice that seemed so embedded in human society?

For one, we have relaxed discrimination against girls and women in other ways — in school and in the workplace. With fewer limits, girls are outperforming boys in the classroom. In the most recent international PISA tests, considered the gold standard for evaluating student performance around the world, 15-year-old girls beat their male counterparts in reading in 79 out of 81 participating countries or economies, while the historic male advantage in math scores has fallen to single digits. 

Girls are also dominating in higher education, with 113 female students at that level for every 100 male students. While women continue to earn less than men, the gender pay gap has been shrinking, and in a number of urban areas in the US, young women have actually been outearning young men. 

Government policies have helped accelerate that shift, in part because they have come to recognize the serious social problems that eventually result from decades of anti-girl discrimination. In countries like South Korea and China, which have long had some of the most skewed gender ratios at birth, governments have cracked down on technologies that enable sex-selective abortion. In India, where female infanticide and neglect have been particularly horrific, slogans like “Save the Daughter, Educate the Daughter” have helped change opinions. 

The shift is being seen not just in birth sex ratios, but in opinion polls — and in the actions of would-be parents.

Between 1983 and 2003, The Economist reported, the proportion of South Korean women who said it was “necessary” to have a son fell from 48 percent to 6 percent, while nearly half of women now say they want daughters. In Japan, the shift has gone even further — as far back as 2002, 75 percent of couples who wanted only one child said they hoped for a daughter.

In the US, which allows sex selection for couples doing in-vitro fertilization, there is growing evidence that would-be parents prefer girls, as do potential adoptive parents. While in the past, parents who had a girl first were more likely to keep trying to have children in an effort to have a boy, the opposite is now true — couples who have a girl first are less likely to keep trying. 

There's still more progress to be made. In northwest of India, for instance, birth ratios that overly skew toward boys are still the norm. In regions of sub-Saharan Africa, birth sex ratios may be relatively normal, but post-birth discrimination in the form of poorer nutrition and worse medical care still lingers. And course, women around the world are still subject to unacceptable levels of violence and discrimination from men.

And some of the reasons for this shift may not be as high-minded as we'd like to think. Boys around the world are struggling in the modern era. They increasingly underperform in education, are more likely to be involved in violent crime, and in general, are failing to launch into adulthood. In the US, 20 percent of American men between 25 and 34 still live with their parents, compared to 15 percent of similarly aged women. 

It also seems to be the case that at least some of the increasing preference for girls is rooted in sexist stereotypes. Parents around the world may now prefer girls partly because they see them as more likely to take care of them in their old age — meaning a different kind of bias against women, that they are more natural caretakers, may be paradoxically driving the decline in prejudice against girls at birth.

But make no mistake — the decline of boy preference is a clear mark of social progress, one measured in millions of girls' lives saved. And maybe one Father's Day, not too long from now, we'll reach the point where daughters and sons are simply children: equally loved and equally welcomed.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","'Slow down' and 'deeply observe' the company culture when starting a new job, says ex-Apple director","https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-companies-culture-apple-car-wash-new-job-bob-baxley-2025-6","Sun, 15 Jun 2025 09:59:00 GMT","

When job-hopping, make sure not to accidentally bring your old company's culture along for the ride, said Bob Baxley, a former director of design at Apple.

""I think my own particular mistake, and I've seen this with some other Apple executives as well, is we went directly from Apple — I left Apple on a Friday and I started Pinterest on a Monday,"" Baxley said on a recent episode of Lenny's Podcast. ""And I didn't give myself time to recalibrate to the Pinterest culture.""

After leaving Apple in 2014, Baxley went on to work as the head of product design at Pinterest, where he said he ""bounced off"" the culture, given that he was still acting as he had in his previous role.

""I came in thinking I was supposed to behave the way I behaved at Apple, which is very direct, fighting hard. It's very — everybody cares about each other, it's never insulting, but it's intense,"" he said. ""That's not really where Pinterest was at the time.""

It's not just Apple's working environment that has a way of sticking with you, Baxley added — most major tech companies have ""really powerful cultures.""

""You get kind of indoctrinated into all those standards and it's really deep. It infuses all of your behavior and how you conduct yourself in the company, away from the company,"" he said. ""And so, I think it's pretty hard to immigrate successfully from one of those environments to another.""

Baxley said that other former Apple employees have smoother transitions, purely by virtue of taking time off before taking up a new position. Baxley cites Hiroki Asai as a prime example — as Apple's former Vice President of Global Marketing, Asai took years off for ""re-wirement"" prior to joining AirBnB, according to his LinkedIn.

""It also should be noted that he had — it was a multi-year gap between the time he left Apple and the time he started Airbnb,"" Baxley said. Asai and Apple did not respond to a request for comment by Business Insider prior to publication.

""At Apple, I think it was Tim or Steve, used to talk about the Apple car wash,"" he added. ""That when you started Apple, they kind of had to take you through the car wash and get off all that stuff that you'd accumulated at other places. It turns out there's a car wash you need to go through when you leave Apple as well.""

Though eschewing old habits as you move into a new role is important, that doesn't mean you should forget the lessons your old job taught you, Baxley said.

""The thing I took away from Apple, and I think this is true for anybody changing from one major culture to another, is most likely, the new place hires you because of the values of the organization you left, but not the behaviors,"" he said.

As you move on, it's worth asking how you can best incorporate the best aspects of your old company's culture in your new workplace, Baxley added.

""And so I think it's important to recalibrate and say, well, I want to hold onto these values,"" he said. ""So at Apple, attention to detail, product excellence, doing everything you can for the customer and the user — so, try to hold onto those values but then think, 'Okay, how are those values best expressed in this culture?'""

Still, Baxley told Business Insider, it won't always be possible to pause between roles — particularly in the tech sphere, where companies usually want new hires to onboard right away. Even if you have to start immediately, it could be helpful to go in while expecting a period of adjustment.

Tracy Davis, 42, still thinks that voting for President Donald Trump was a good choice.

But she wishes the president would think more carefully about how his actions are affecting student-loan borrowers like herself.

""I did vote for Trump,"" Davis told Business Insider. ""This was a very big surprise for me. I mean, I was thinking he was going to fix some things, and it didn't go the way I was seeing it going with student loans.""

Davis is referring to the Trump administration's move to restart collections on defaulted student loans in early May after a five-year pause. Negative credit reporting for defaulted student loans resumed in October 2024, and Trump's Education Department announced that collections would resume in an effort to restore accountability to the student-loan system.

""Borrowing money and failing to pay it back isn't a victimless offense,"" Linda McMahon, Trump's education secretary, wrote in an opinion piece. ""Debt doesn't go away; it gets transferred to others. If borrowers don't pay their debts to the government, taxpayers do.""

Prior to the pandemic pause, Davis said she was able to make her $150 student-loan payments. However, once the pause lifted, she was billed nearly $400, which she said she could not afford. It caused her to fall behind on payments, and her credit score took a hit after negative credit reporting resumed.

""I think they pulled the trigger a little too fast, especially with hitting the credit report, because we're not all in the same situation,"" Davis said. ""I just wish there was more thought put into it.""

Business Insider has heard from dozens of student-loan borrowers who are delinquent or in default on their debt, including some who voted for Trump. Borrowers tend to go into default after 270 days of missed payments.

While many borrowers expressed frustration with the abrupt collections restart and the consequences for defaulting, like negative credit reporting and wage garnishment, some said they recognize the importance of restarting the system and ensuring borrowers pay back their loans.

Ellen Keast, a spokesperson for the Department of Education, previously confirmed to BI that Social Security garnishment for defaulted borrowers is paused: ""The Trump Administration is committed to protecting social security recipients who oftentimes rely on a fixed income.""

However, the department still plans to garnish wages for defaulted borrowers later this summer. Davis is concerned that she might be on the receiving end of that policy.

""If you were way behind and you had no intention of paying them back, yes, go after them, garnish wages,"" Davis said. ""But when you're trying to make it and you're trying to honestly make an effort to pay them off, I don't think that's right that we're getting wages garnished or credit hits.""

Miranda Metheny, 37, is in default on her student loans — and she's rethinking the vote she cast for Trump.

""I'm having a bit of buyer's remorse,"" Metheny said. ""Now, seeing what all is taking place, I'm like, maybe I just shouldn't have voted.""

Metheny is unable to work due to a disability, and she can't afford to dig into the $600 monthly disability insurance to pay off her student loans while also helping support her two children.

""We already don't make enough to really even survive at this point,"" Metheny said. ""We're all robbing Peter to pay Paul, and now you're going to cut into that? I worry about people that are already hurting.""

The Department of Education estimated that 5 million borrowers are currently in default. Recent data from the New York Federal Reserve showed that millions more could enter default this summer; since negative credit reporting resumed in the fall, 8.04% of balances moved into serious delinquency in the first quarter of 2025.

While some higher education analysts previously told BI that the surge in delinquency was expected, many borrowers are at risk of defaulting because they might not be aware of their payment status and are unprepared to afford an extra monthly bill.

Some student-loan borrowers at risk of default said they still support Trump's move to collect on defaulted student loans. Cheri, 67, said that she voted for Trump and supports his stance that loans should be paid back. She hasn't made any payments on her loans since the pandemic pause, though, and she said she's not financially prepared to shoulder another monthly bill.

""I'm not going to bash the Trump administration. But that being said, I think that turning people over to collections is a very drastic move after what we just went through over the past four years,"" Cheri said. ""I'm opposed to that.""

Aside from collections on defaulted student loans, the Trump administration is urging Congress to pass the president's big spending bill. The version of the bill that passed the House would condense existing income-driven repayment plans into two plans that have longer repayment periods. McMahon wrote in a June 11 post on X that the bill ""will prevent future Democrat administrations from illegally transferring student loan debt to American taxpayers.""

Former President Joe Biden's SAVE plan — an income-driven repayment plan that would have allowed for cheaper monthly payments — is also blocked in court, leaving borrowers with fewer repayment options.

As far as default consequences go, Sen. Elizabeth Warren said that McMahon confirmed in a private meeting on June 10 that Social Security garnishments will remain paused.

""The Education Secretary has assured me that the pause that is currently in place will stay in place and if there is to be any change in that, she would get in touch with me directly before we go there,"" Warren said.

Metheny said she hopes that the administration will consider more relief for borrowers.

""We're not all billionaires,"" she said. ""We can't just come up with that amount of money that quickly.""

Police tape blocks off the home of Minnesota state Representative Melissa Hortman, on June 15.

The manhunt for a shooter who killed a Democratic state lawmaker in Minnesota and wounded another went into a second day, as speculation about a motive focused on the suspect's stance on abortion.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Vance L. Boelter, 57. The four known victims include Melissa Hortman, the Democratic leader in the state House, and her husband, Mark, who were fatally shot at their house early Saturday.

Money managers from Lazard Asset Management Ltd. to Pictet Asset Management Ltd. have been scooping up Latin American local bonds, Asian currencies and some high-yield sovereign debt.

The concept of a fast train between Los Angeles and San Francisco makes sense, but the project has always lacked focus.

Will they ever finish?

Photographer: David Paul Morris//Bloomberg

If President Donald Trump follows through on his recent threats to cut off federal funding for California's long-troubled high-speed rail project, it would be better for all concerned: For all intents and purposes, this thing went off the rails (sorry) a long time ago.

Escalating costs have made it clear that no money was or ever would be available to realize the vision of a modern bullet train between Los Angeles and San Francisco. What's under construction is a segment through California's Central Valley, where costs are cheap compared to other parts of the system but which offers almost no economic value. The whole thing has become a zombie project that nobody with clout in state politics can either rescue or kill. A hated outsider officially ending it would let the state's Democrats complain while also allowing them to acknowledge the reality that it's not going to happen.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

China's biotechnology stocks have shaken off a four-year slump to be among the hottest performers in Asia this year and funds are tipping further gains.

The Hang Seng Biotech Index has surged more than 60% since the start of January amid investor enthusiasm over a pair of billion-dollar deals involving foreign firms licensing Chinese drugs. Share gains at two highly anticipated listings of local producers have further burnished the sector's appeal. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Sen. Amy Klobuchar remembered fellow Minnesota Democrat Mellissa Hortman, who was fatally shot in her home early Saturday morning alongside her husband, Mark, as a ""true public servant.""

""I just wish everyone in the world, the political world, knew this woman like we know her in Minnesota, loved by Democrats and Republicans,"" Klobuchar said of Hortman, who was a member of the Minnesota House since 2005.

""We started out together in politics, moms with young kids, and somehow she was able to balance getting to know everyone, door knock every house in her district, while raising two children,"" she continued on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

Klobuchar said she was at a dinner with Hortman the night before a gunman impersonating a police officer killed her and her husband in an act officials are calling a ""politically motivated assassination.""

A massive manhunt continues Sunday for the suspect, who officials have identified as 57-year-old Vance Luther Boelter.

The suspect also shot State Senator John A. Hoffman, a fellow Democrat, and his wife, Yvette, in a separate attack at their home early Saturday morning.

Klobuchar said Sunday that the couple was ""hanging in there.""

She said that Hoffman may need ""additional surgeries,"" but he is currently in stable condition.

Klobuchar said that authorities believe the suspect could still be in the Midwest, and that they've put out an alert in South Dakota.

""We believe he's somewhere in the vicinity and that they are going to find him,"" Klobuchar said.

Klobuchar emphasized that if anybody in the public spots the suspect, they should ""not approach him.""

""My concern is that this guy is going to come up against just an innocent, try to take their car, try to go into their house right now,"" Klobuchar said.

""A lot of the political leaders in our state have received extra protection, but not the innocents out there,"" she added.

Authorities discovered a ""manifesto"" in the suspect's car that included several names of officials and lawmakers.

Klobuchar said that she has received additional security without her request.

Leaders of some of the world's biggest economic powers will arrive in the Canadian Rockies on Sunday for a Group of Seven (G-7) summit overshadowed by a widening war across the Middle East and U.S. President Donald Trump's unresolved trade war with allies and rivals alike.

Israel's strikes on Iran and Tehran's retaliation, which appeared to catch many world leaders unawares, are the latest sign of a more volatile world as Trump seeks to withdraw the U.S. from its role as world policeman.

Speaking on a flight to Canada to attend the summit, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he had discussed efforts to de-escalate the situation with Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as other world leaders.

Britain is sending Royal Air Force jets and other military reinforcements to the Middle East.

""We do have longstanding concerns about the nuclear program Iran has. We do recognize Israel's right to self-defense, but I'm absolutely clear that this needs to de-escalate. There is a huge risk of escalation for the region and more widely,"" Starmer said, adding he expected ""intense discussions"" would continue at the summit.

As summit host, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has decided to abandon the annual practice of issuing a joint statement, or communique, at the end of the meeting.

With other leaders wanting to talk to Trump in an effort to talk him out of imposing tariffs, the summit risks being a series of bilateral conversations rather than a show of unity.

Trump is the summit wild card. Looming over the meeting are Trump's inflammatory threats to make Canada the 51st state and take over Greenland. French President Emmanuel Macron is making a highly symbolic stop in Greenland on his way to Canada, meeting the Arctic territory's leader and Denmark's prime minister aboard a Danish helicopter carrier.

Macron, who is one of the very few leaders to have known Trump during his first term, was the first European leader to visit the White House after Trump took office, emerging unscathed from the Oval Office encounter.

But despite the two leaders' sporadic bromance, Macron's approach to Trump has failed to bear major results, with France caught up in the president's planned tariffs on the European Union.

Nor did it bring any U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine despite Macron's efforts, together with Starmer, to build a coalition of nations that could deploy forces after any ceasefire with Russia, with the hope it would convince the Trump administration to provide backup.

Trump is scheduled to arrive late Sunday in Kananaskis, Alberta. Bilateral meetings between other leaders are possible Sunday, but the summit program does not get underway until Monday.

Peter Boehm, Canada's sherpa of the 2018 G7 summit in Quebec and veteran of six G7 summits, expects the heads of state to pivot the discussion to devote more time to the war.

""Leaders can accommodate a discussion, perhaps even a statement,"" Boehm said. ""The foreign policy agenda has become much larger with this.""

Leaders who are not part of the G-7 but have been invited to the summit by Carney include the heads of state of India, Ukraine, Brazil, South Africa, South Korea, Australia, Mexico and the UAE. Avoiding tariffs will continue to be top of mind.

""Leaders, and there are some new ones coming, will want to meet Donald Trump,"" Boehm said. ""Trump doesn't like the big round table as much he likes the one-on-one.""

Bilateral meetings with the American president can be fraught as Trump has used them to try to intimidate the leaders of Ukraine and South Africa.

Former Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien told a panel this week that if Trump does act out, leaders should ignore him and remain calm like Carney did in his recent Oval Office meeting.

""He tends to be a bully,"" Chrétien said. ""If Trump has decided to make a show to be in the news, he will do something crazy. Let him do it and keep talking normally.""

Starmer had a warm Oval Office meeting with the president in February, wooing Trump with an invitation for a state visit from King Charles III. Trump has praised the British prime minister, despite their political differences.

Last month Britain and the U.S. announced they had struck a trade deal that will slash American tariffs on U.K. autos, steel and aluminum. It has yet to take effect, however, though British officials say they are not concerned the Trump administration might go back on its word.

Starmer's attempts to woo Trump have left him in an awkward position with Canada, the U.K.'s former colony, close ally and fellow Commonwealth member. Starmer has also drawn criticism — especially from Canadians — for failing to address Trump's stated desire to make Canada the 51st state.

Asked if he has told Trump to stop the 51st state threats, Starmer told The Associated Press: ""I'm not going to get into the precise conversations I've had, but let me be absolutely clear: Canada is an independent, sovereign country and a much-valued member of the Commonwealth.""

The war in Ukraine will be on the agenda. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is due to attend the summit and is expected to meet with Trump, a reunion coming just months after their bruising Oval Office encounter, which laid bare the risks of having a meeting with the U.S. president.

Starmer met with Carney in Ottawa before the summit for talks focused on security and trade, in the first visit to Canada by a British prime minister for eight years.

German officials were keen to counter the suggestion that the summit would be a ""six against one"" event, noting that the G-7 countries have plenty of differences of emphasis among themselves on various issues.

""The only problem you cannot forecast is what the president of the United States will do depending on the mood, the need to be in the news,"" said Chrétien.

The S&P 500 is less than 3% from an all-time high. Six of its 11 sectors are within 5% of an all-time high. But even as the U.S. stock market index proves its resilience during a volatile stretch for investors, more money from within portfolios is expected to shift in to privately traded companies.

Jan Van Eck, CEO of ETF and mutual fund manager VanEck, says the trend of companies staying private for longer rather than seeking an initial public offering is here to stay and it offers new opportunities.

High-profile examples include Elon Musk's SpaceX, Sam Altman's OpenAI and fintech Stripe.

According to Van Eck, allocations to private assets will jump from a current average portfolio holding level of approximately 2% to 10% in the years ahead.

Some ETFs have begun to invest small portions of their assets in privately held company shares, including SpaceX, such as the ERShares Private-Public Crossover ETF (XOVR). VanEck has launched an ETF tackling the private opportunity in a different way: taking big positions in the publicly traded shares of the investment giants, including private equity firms and other alternative asset managers, that own many private companies.

The VanEck Alternative Asset Manager ETF (GPZ), which launched this month, has a portfolio holdings list that includes Brookfield, Blackstone, KKR, Brookfield Asset Management and Apollo, which combined make up almost 50% of the fund. TPG, Ares and Carlyle are also big positions, in the 5% range each.

The new ETF extends an existing focus on private markets for VanEck. For over a decade, it has offered investors access to private credit, through the VanEck BDC Income ETF (BIZD), which invests in the business development companies that lend to small- and mid-sized private companies. That ETF has a high level of exposure to Ares, Blue Owl, Blackstone, Main Street and Golub Capital, which make up about half of the fund. It pays a hefty dividend of 11%. 

""You have to believe this is a secular trend and growth will be higher than that for normal money managers, including ETF and mutual fund managers,"" said Van Eck.

He cautions, however, there is more volatility in these funds compared to the public equity market overall.  ""You have to size it appropriately,"" he added.

Senate Republicans' proposal to overhaul student loan repayment could trigger a surge in defaults, one expert said.

The Senate GOP reconciliation bill's higher education provisions ""would cause widespread harm to American families,"" Sameer Gadkaree, the president of The Institute for College Access & Success, said in a statement. The proposals do so by ""making student debt much harder to repay"" and ""unleashing an avalanche of student loan defaults,"" he wrote.

The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions introduced bill text on June 10 that would change how millions of new borrowers pay down their debt. The proposal made only minor tweaks to the repayment terms in the legislation House Republicans advanced in May.

More from Personal Finance:Experts weigh pros and cons of $1,000 Trump baby bonusHow Trump spending bill may curb low-income tax creditWhy millions would lose health insurance under House spending bill

With control of Congress, Republicans can pass their legislation using ""budget reconciliation,"" which needs only a simple majority in the Senate.

Gadkaree and other consumer advocates have expressed concerns about how the new terms would imperil many borrowers' ability to meet their monthly bills — and to ever get out of their debt.

More than 42 million Americans hold student loans, and collectively, outstanding federal education debt exceeds $1.6 trillion. More than 5 million borrowers were in default as of late April, and that total could swell to roughly 10 million borrowers within a few months, according to the Trump administration.

Currently, borrowers have about a dozen plan options to repay their student debt, according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.

But under the Senate Republican proposal, there would be just two repayment plan choices for those who borrow federal student loans after July 1, 2026. (Current borrowers should maintain access to other existing repayment plans.)

As of now, borrowers who enroll in the standard repayment plan typically get their debt divided into 120 fixed payments, over 10 years. But the Republicans' new standard plan would provide borrowers fixed payments over a period between 10 years and 25 years, depending on how much they owe.

For example, those with a balance exceeding $50,000 would be in repayment for 15 years; if you owe over $100,000, your fixed payments will last for 25 years.

Borrowers would also have an option of enrolling in an income-based repayment plan, known as the ""Repayment Assistance Plan,"" or RAP.

Monthly bills for borrowers on RAP would be set as a share of their income. Payments would typically range from 1% to 10% of a borrower's income; the more they earn, the bigger their required payment. There would be a minimum payment of $10 a month for all borrowers.

While IDR plans now conclude in loan forgiveness after 20 years or 25 years, RAP wouldn't lead to debt erasure until 30 years.

The plan would offer borrowers some new perks, including a $50 reduction in the required monthly payment per dependent.

Still, Kantrowitz said: ""Many low-income borrowers will be in repayment under RAP for the full 30-year duration.""

A typical student loan borrower with a college degree could pay an extra $2,929 per year if the Senate GOP proposal of RAP is enacted, compared to the Biden administration's now blocked SAVE plan, according to a recent analysis by the Student Borrower Protection Center.

The Center included the calculations in a June 11 letter to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.

""As the Committee considers this legislation, it is clear that a vote for this bill is a vote to saddle millions of borrowers across the country with more student loan debt, at the same moment that a slowing economy, a reckless trade war, and spiraling costs of living squeeze working families from every direction,"" Mike Pierce, the executive director of the Center, wrote in the letter.

Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, said the proposal would stop requiring that taxpayers who didn't go to college foot the loan payments for those with degrees.

""Biden and Democrats unfairly attempted to shift student debt onto taxpayers that chose not to go to college,"" Cassidy said in a statement.

Cassidy said his party's legislation would save taxpayers at least $300 billion.

Artificial intelligence is shaking up the advertising business and ""unnerving"" investors, one industry leader told CNBC.

""I think this AI disruption ... unnerving investors in every industry, and it's totally disrupting our business,"" Mark Read, the outgoing CEO of British advertising group WPP, told CNBC's Karen Tso on Tuesday.

The advertising market is under threat from emerging generative AI tools that can be used to materialize pieces of content at rapid pace. The past couple of years has seen the rise of a number of AI image generators, including OpenAI's DALL-E, Google's Veo and Midjourney.

In his first interview since announcing he would step down as WPP boss, Read said that AI is ""going to totally revolutionize our business.""

""AI is going to make all the world's expertise available to everybody at extremely low cost,"" he said at London Tech Week. ""The best lawyer, the best psychologist, the best radiologist, the best accountant, and indeed, the best advertising creatives and marketing people often will be an AI, you know, will be driven by AI.""

Read said that 50,000 WPP employees now use WPP Open, the company's own AI-powered marketing platform.

""That, I think, is my legacy in many ways,"" he added.

Structural pressure on creative parts of the ad business are driving industry consolidation, Read also noted, adding that companies would need to ""embrace"" the way in which AI would impact everything from creating briefs and media plans to optimizing campaigns.

A report from Forrester released in June last year showed that more than 60% of U.S. ad agencies are already making use of generative AI, with a further 31% saying they're exploring use cases for the technology.

Read is not alone in this view. Advertising is undergoing a ""huge transformation"" due to the disruptive effects of AI, French advertising giant Publicis Groupe's CEO Maurice Levy told CNBC at the Viva Tech conference in Paris.

He noted that AI image and video generation tools are speeding up content production drastically, while automated messaging systems can now achieve ""personalization at scale like never before.""

However, the Publicis chief stressed that AI should only be considered a tool that people can use to augment their lives.

""We should not believe that AI is more than a tool,"" he added.

And while AI is likely to impact some jobs, Levy ultimately thinks it will create more roles than it destroys.

""Will AI replace me, and will AI kill some jobs? I think that AI, yes, will destroy some jobs,"" Levy conceded. However, he added that, ""more importantly, AI will transform jobs and will create more jobs. So the net balance will be probably positive.""

This, he says, would be in keeping with the labor impacts of previous technological inventions like the internet and smartphones.

""There will be more autonomous work,"" Levy added.

Still, Nicole Denman Greene, analyst at Gartner, warns brands should be wary of causing a negative reaction from consumers who are skeptical of AI's impact on human creativity.

According to a Gartner survey from September, 82% of consumers said firms using generative AI should prioritize preserving human jobs, even if it means lower profits.

""Pivot from what AI can do to what it should do in advertising,"" Greene told CNBC.

""What it should do is help create groundbreaking insights, unique execution to reach diverse and niche audiences, push boundaries on what 'marketing' is and deliver more brand differentiated, helpful and relevant personalized experiences, including deliver on the promise of hyper-personalization.""

In this article

Kelly Ortberg's first Paris Air Show as Boeing CEO was set to be relatively upbeat.

Under his leadership that began in August, the company has made strides in ramping up production of its bestselling 737 Max jets, increasing cash-generating deliveries of new planes, and indicating that it's turning a corner from a series of manufacturing and safety crises and years of lost ground to rival Airbus. Shares are up more than 13% this year, outpacing the S&P 500.

But after an Air India flight crashed on Thursday, marking the first fatal air disaster of a Boeing Dreamliner, Ortberg canceled plans to go to the massive air show that begins on Sunday.

The trade event is a big draw for the industry and is held every other year, alternating with the Farnborough Air Show in the U.K. Boeing, Airbus and other aerospace giants host champagne-flowing parties, hold flashy deal-signing ceremonies with executives flanked by model planes, and show off their new aircraft with extreme maneuvers for spectators below.

""As our industry prepares to start the Paris Air Show, Stephanie and I have both canceled plans to attend so we can be with our team, and focus on our customer and the investigation,"" Ortberg said in a note to employees late Thursday, referring to Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stephanie Pope.

All but one of the 242 people aboard Air India Flight 171 were killed when the more than 11-year-old Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner that was headed for London on a sweltering day crashed into a medical student dining hall seconds after takeoff from Ahmedabad in western India. The sole survivor was an India-born British national in seat 11A.

The cause of the crash is unknown and will take weeks or months to determine. Questions focus on how the plane so quickly and evenly lost altitude, appearing to glide into a fireball crash. Cockpit voice and data recorders, known as ""black boxes,"" will provide key information.

""It is important that we do not speculate about the accident and let the investigators do their work,"" Ortberg wrote.

The plane's engine maker, GE Aerospace, said it will postpone an investor day scheduled for Tuesday.

The crash isn't the only outside factor changing the gathering in Paris.

Shortly before the Paris Air Show was set to begin, Israel launched overnight missile strikes on Iran. Hours later, Iran launched drones toward Israeli territory. Airlines canceled flights, with jets in the air diverting or returning to their destinations, while hundreds of others skirted the airspace.

The escalating tensions will make military budgets and spending an even bigger focus for the air show, but they also raise concerns about how conflicts and geopolitical tensions could impact demand for commercial air travel.

Despite the crash and other external concerns, Boeing, Airbus and Embraer are expected to lock in hundreds of airplane orders. Wait times for popular new aircraft models already stretch into the next decade with demand still strong.

Boeing forecast on Saturday that the world will need 43,600 commercial airplanes over the next two decades, with emerging markets driving growth. It expects those markets will account for more than half of the world's fleet in 2044, up from a 40% share last year.

Some of the order signings could come from previously undisclosed customers, though there are many new orders on the line, aviation analysts say.

Ongoing issues, such as a lack of trained workers, have delayed deliveries of new planes, while on-again, off-again tariffs have raised concerns about more expensive aircraft and components.

Pricing has also firmed up. A new Airbus A321neo was going for $65 million as of the end of April, up from $58 million at the start of 2023, while a new Boeing 737 Max 8 cost about $55.5 million in April, compared with $50.25 million in early 2023, according to Ishka an aviation data and advisory firm.

With aircraft still in short supply, lease rates are also going up for older planes for airlines that prefer not to make multimillion-dollar aircraft purchases up front or that might need them for shorter time periods. A 12-year-old Boeing 737 costs $241,000 a month to rent as of the end of April, up nearly 42% from two years earlier, and an Airbus A320 of the same age was $239,000 a month, a 50% gain, according to IBA Insight, another aviation data firm.

U.K.-based IBA predicted manufacturers could see between 700 and 800 commercial aircraft orders during the Paris show, a tally that includes firm orders, options, and looser commitments like purchase intention letters and memoranda of understanding.

Customers could include Ethiopian Airlines and Polish carrier Lot, as well as Vietnam Airlines, AirAsia, Royal Air Maroc, Etihad and Saudi carrier Riyadh, said Ishka.

""A large deal from China is inevitable sometime, for replacement if not growth reasons,"" Ishka said in a note last week.

Air India, which Ishka had previously listed as a potential customer, was no longer expected to buy new planes given last week's tragedy.

Airplane customers are going bigger as international travel continues to bring in money.

""It used to be all about single-aisle orders,"" said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at aerospace consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory. Now, ""everyone is booking these monster twin-aisle orders for international traffic.""

He said major international airlines like Turkish Airlines, Gulf carriers and others have expanded in recent years, competing for more global travelers, ""slicing the pizza into smaller pieces.""

Since orders are placed years in advance, Aboulafia said he doesn't expect a big impact on demand because of the crash, though some might be held back during the show.

""It's a terrible tragedy. It doesn't make anyone's lives easier,"" he said. ""I just don't think given what we know now it has anything to do with the design or the build of the airplane. It sure doesn't look like it.""

Bitcoin (BTC) BTC$105,592.48 is holding firm above $105,000 after recovering from a sharp downturn triggered by escalating tensions in the Middle East. The leading cryptocurrency dropped below $104,000 following Israel's strike on Iran, but quickly regained lost ground, now trading at $105,590, up 0.15% in the past 24 hours.

Bitcoin's swift rebound suggests underlying strength, with high-volume buying visible during the dip. Analysts point to the $104,000–$105,000 range as an important zone of support, as price action continues to grind upward. Sentiment remains cautious — reflected in a pullback in trader confidence — but structurally, bitcoin's trend remains intact.

Beyond near-term volatility, bitcoin continues to capture the imagination of a younger generation of investors. In a recent episode of the Unchained podcast, Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise Asset Management, described how bitcoin's appeal increasingly transcends traditional financial goals.

According to Park, many younger people no longer aspire to own suburban homes or pursue the white-picket-fence ideal. Instead, they're focused on becoming ""wholecoiners"" — those who own at least one full bitcoin — as a new form of prestige and long-term security. For some, the goal even extends beyond personal wealth to securing a financial legacy across generations, reflecting the popular meme of ""retiring your bloodline.""

Park added that bitcoin's global, apolitical nature is central to this shift. It offers a shared value system, allowing people worldwide to ""opt out"" of systems they no longer trust. That sentiment is fueling a cultural pivot: bitcoin is no longer just a hedge or speculative asset, but for many, it has become a social signal of financial independence and self-sovereignty.

As BTC holds above $105K and macro catalysts loom, the contrast between short-term fear and long-term conviction has rarely been sharper.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","I tried 2 ways of investing in bitcoin. One thrived and one failed miserably, teaching me a valuable lesson.","https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-investing-strategies-ibit-etf-blackrock-mstr-loss-trump-trade-2025-6","Sun, 15 Jun 2025 08:35:00 GMT","

Back in December of 2024, I decided to hop aboard the bitcoin train and add some crypto exposure to my portfolio.

Markets were flush off of the recent Trump victory, there were whispers of a national bitcoin reserve, and bitcoin had recently broken the $100,000 threshold for the first time. The cryptocurrency had gone mainstream enough for late adopters like myself to deem it investable.

For my first foray into bitcoin, I purchased a share of Blackrock's iShares Bitcoin Trust Trust (IBIT). I later added a share of Semler Scientific (SMLR), a healthcare technology company that holds bitcoin on its balance sheet. I wanted to try multiple methods of investing in bitcoin.

In hindsight, I realize I committed the classic retail investor impulse: buying in because of FOMO. Sure, positive investor sentiment led to gains in bitcoin, as well as the ETF I bought that was designed to track the crypto. But my stock purchase proved ill-timed.

Almost six months later, bitcoin has crossed new all-time-highs, and I have mixed feelings on my investment.

I opted to buy IBIT instead of actual spot bitcoin because it was a more accessible way to get exposure. I didn't want the hassle of setting up a Coinbase account. Plus, buying a single share in an ETF was more psychologically appealing than buying a tiny fraction of a bitcoin (I did not have a spare $100,000 or the risk tolerance to buy an entire bitcoin).

The performance has been encouraging. Year-to-date, IBIT is up about 14%, outpacing a 12% gain for bitcoin itself. It's done its job of tracking the crypto, and even added a little extra. And it's far outperformed the S&P 500, which is up just 2% in 2025.

ETFs can experience slight tracking differences due to management fees, operational costs, and the timing of inflows and outflows. But if you want a rough proxy of bitcoin performance without actually owning the underlying asset, IBIT gets the job done.

A year and a half over its launch, IBIT has gained incredible popularity, growing to over $70 billion in assets under management. Robert Cannon, a financial advisor at Experity Wealth with a specialization in alternative assets, recommends his bitcoin-curious clients to start with the ETF.

""It's the easiest, cleanest representation of bitcoin, compared to some of the other strategies that are a bit esoteric,"" Cannon told me.

The ETF wrapper has really helped bitcoin adoption take off in the last year, Rahul Sen Sharma, president and co-CEO at the custom index provider Indxx, told me. Sharma's seeing a surge in interest for bitcoin and digital asset ETFs, and he believes Trump's continued support for crypto will pave the way for more mainstream adoption.

Getting bitcoin exposure through other methods was indeed more esoteric — and much less profitable.

I added Semler Scientific to my portfolio on January 8, 2025, and it's down more than 40% since then.

There's a growing trend among companies to add bitcoin to their balance sheets, with Strategy, Tesla, and GameStop being one of the most prominent examples. The president's own Trump Media and Technology Group has recently raised $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin. Semler Scientific started adding bitcoin to its balance sheet in May of last year and now holds over 4,000 bitcoins.

It sounds like a good idea in theory: holding bitcoin as a reserve asset could be a hedge against inflation and dollar weakness, and could also lead to capital appreciation as bitcoin takes off.

Some companies like Strategy have had tremendous success. The firm has accumulated over half a million bitcoins, and the stock has outperformed the underlying crypto year-to-date. However, it's hard to replicate the scale and expertise of Strategy. While many of Cannon's clients often inquire about bitcoin treasury companies like Strategy, he usually recommends they stick to the basics with an ETF.

There were also company-specific headwinds for Semler Scientific. The company had been under investigation from the Department of Justice for allegedly misleading claims about one of its medical devices.

My takeaway from the experience is that buying a single stocks as a bitcoin proxy is probably not a good idea. When you buy into a bitcoin treasury company, you're also inheriting all of its company-specific risks. That includes everything from management decisions and financial health to legal exposure, product performance, and market sentiment around the core business.

As a result, the benefits of diversification with bitcoin are watered down. If you're looking for bitcoin exposure, either buying the real thing or a spot ETF is your best bet.

Maybe the strategy from here on out is to close out of my position in SMLR and do some tax-loss harvesting this year.

 Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor hinted the company would purchase more Bitcoin on Monday when traditional financial markets open. 

Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor posted the Bitcoin (BTC) chart signaling an impending BTC purchase by the company, despite the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, which could rattle global financial markets when they open on Monday.

The company's most recent Bitcoin buy occurred on June 9, with a relatively small purchase of 1,045 BTC, valued at approximately $110 million, bringing Strategy's total holdings to 582,000 BTC.

Data from SaylorTracker shows that Strategy is up over 50% on its investment. This translates to over $20 billion in unrealized capital gains in fiat terms.

Saylor's announcement of an imminent Bitcoin acquisition is another sign of investor confidence in BTC amid the Israel-Iran conflict and the looming, uncertainty over global financial markets. Investors are watching to see how the financial system will react when markets open on Monday, following escalations by both countries over the weekend.

Israel launched airstrikes against Tehran, Iran's capital city, at 22:50 UTC on Thursday. The price of Bitcoin slid by only 3% following news of the initial strike and has held firm around the $105,000 level since the conflict started.

Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded five days of consecutive inflows this week amid the ongoing uncertainty surrounding trade tariffs, the US economy, and the growing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.

BTC ETFs experienced a net inflow of over $1.3 billion in capital this week, according to data from Farside Investors.

The Crypto Fear and Greed Index, a metric tracking overall market sentiment, is currently at 60, indicating ""greed"" among investors and a bullish sign for digital assets in the wake of mounting geopolitical tensions.

Despite the current price resilience of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, Coin Bureau founder and market analyst Nic Puckrin warned that Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz would negatively impact risk asset prices in the near term.

The Strait of Hormuz is a narrow waterway that connects the Gulf of Oman to the Persian Gulf. This critical oil shipping route is responsible for the transport of approximately 20% of the world's oil supply.

Energy is a necessary input at all levels of the economic production process, and a spike in energy prices will likely impact global financial markets as businesses and investors contend with the increased operational costs.

While fear grips the broader crypto market and many traders are panic-selling their Ethereum holdings, one whale is taking the opposite approach, snapping up as many ETH tokens as possible amid the market crash. New data from blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain reports that this Ethereum whale has just scooped up a staggering $127 million worth of ETH, raising eyebrows across the crypto community and indicating that they may know something the market doesn't. 

While the market is facing volatility from the Bitcoin price crash and the mounting uncertainty from the Israel-Iran conflict, a major Ethereum whale makes a striking move by accumulating 48,825 ETH. This massive ETH haul, purchased from major crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Wintermute, is valued at a whopping $127 million.

Notably, Lookonchain highlights that the large-scale purchase had occurred during a period of intense panic selling and crowd uncertainty. Highlighting the strategic prowess of this whale, the analytics platform revealed that they had previously pocketed an impressive $30 million in profits from an earlier ETH trade. Now, the large-scale investor appears to be re-entering the market, especially at a time when prices are projected to fall dramatically. 

Based on the timing of the whale's purchases, it seems that the investor is taking a buy-the-dip strategy, capitalizing on steep price drops to accumulate more ETH. This showcases confidence in the potential for Ethereum to surge once the market stabilizes. 

Moving forward, Lookonchain reveals that the whale's recent $127 million ETH purchase was made at an average price of $2,605 per coin—a level that many in the retail crowd fear may still have room to fall. Yet, for this investor, the recent market downturn has become an opportunity worth seizing for future gains. 



Transaction records also show large inflows of ETH into a single receiving wallet, with high-value transfers coming in quick succession. These included multi-million dollar movements from Coinbase hot wallets and Wintermute's trading addresses, consolidating tens of thousands of ETH coins in a short window. 

Before these ETH acquisitions, the whale had received over $127 million in USDC stablecoin, possibly suggesting a planned and calculated move rather than a spontaneous dip buy. 

While there's no direct evidence that this whale has insider information, the timing and scale of the ETH accumulation suggests a strong conviction in Ethereum's near-to-long-term outlook. This kind of aggressive buying rarely happens without premises, and based on prior buying behavior, this isn't just another speculative trader. 

As Lookonchain reported earlier, this Whale's wallet is linked to a history of well-timed ETH plays. Within the crypto community, many members have expressed admiration for the whale's strategic play. Some highlight that their analysis based on the previous $30 million profit is proof of sharp market insight. Others believe that once the market settles down and exits its bearish phase, the investor could be positioned for even greater profits.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Analyst Drops Bearish Bombshell: Bitcoin To $93,500, Ethereum To $2,100, And XRP To $1.6","https://bitcoinist.com/analyst-drops-bearish-bombshell-bitcoin-to-93500-ethereum-to-2100-xrp-to-1-6/","Sun, 15 Jun 2025 04:00:59 GMT","

Bitcoin has continued to hover around the $105,000 price level for the past 24 hours, a level which it has respected for most of the past seven days. Ethereum, on the other hand, is trying to hold above $2,500, while XRP is also holding its ground above $2.10 within the past 24 hours. 

Some analysts still expect a resumption of bullish momentum once the current range breaks to the upside, but others have taken a more cautious or outright pessimistic stance. One of such bearish outlooks in recent days came from crypto commentator Warren MUPPET, who shared a forecast of a strong downside correction for Bitcoin and other large cryptocurrencies.

The broader crypto market appears to be stuck in a consolidation range, with the Fear & Greed Index currently reading 52, which is a neutral sentiment that could easily swing in either direction. According to crypto analyst Warren MUPPET on the social media platform X, this swing will be to the downside. 

Particularly, the crypto commentator recently posted a blunt list of projected price levels that sent waves through some crypto traders. The post, with no charts or technical context, had simply highlighted the price targets for Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Fartcoin, and Hype. Despite the lack of technical and and fundamental analysis explanation, the message was clear that a sharp correction could be on the horizon.

According to the analyst, Bitcoin will crash from its current price levels to $93,500, Ethereum will crash to $2,100, Fartcoin will crash to $0.68, XRP will crash to $1.6, and Hype will crash to $28. In one of the comments to the original post, the crypto commentator also predicted the possibility of Solana crashing to $85.

These numbers might seem extreme to some, but they are not far-fetched. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP all crahsed to these price levels just two months ago in April. This gives some credibility to the warning and if sentiment turns negative, a drop to these prices may not be out of the picture.

Previous price action data suggests that bearish phases often come up swiftly after prolonged consolidation in high zones. If that plays out again, Bitcoin slipping below $100,000 could quickly escalate into a wider marlet price crash. Also, with Ethereum and XRP also consolidating around their respective resistance levels, the chances of a synchronized following Bitcoin crash below $100,000 can't be ruled out.

Therefore, the bullish/bearish outlook all depends on if Bitcoin can hold above $100,000. If sentiment weakens in the coming days, the analyst's projections may no longer seem like an exaggeration.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,096, Ethereum is trading at $2,540, XRP is trading at $2.16, while Hype is trading at $42.

Shiba Inu may have had its time in the spotlight in 2021, but in 2025 there is increasing interest in alternatives like Remittix. RTX, a new PayFi platform, has raised more than $15.5 million and sold more than 527 million tokens at $0.0781. With a Q3 wallet launch and a 50% token bonus on the table, investors are betting on real-world payment utility—not memes.

Shiba Inu price soared over 300% in its infancy stage to $0.000088 in 2021. But that was temporary. Since then, the momentum has dissipated. Rollouts like ShibaSwap and Shibarium have failed to help SHIB regain the lost momentum. 

Current prices range from $0.000013 to $0.000026, with most projections suggesting that SHIB can close 2025 in the $0.0000145 to $0.000023 zone, according to Changelly and CoinCodex. Long-term investors are beginning to lose hope for hitting all-time highs.

As Shiba Inu price action slows, SHIB whales are looking towards use-case-driven projects. Remittix is gaining popularity with its focus on faster crypto-to-fiat settlement in 24 hours. It's already making it easier for African remote workers to receive client payments without the traditional delay. The Q3 release of the wallet will further drive this. 

And with its colossal addressable market for cross-border finance, RTX gives a chance for genuine adoption. Investors are grabbing the 50% bonus on the presale before it hits its $18M softcap.

While Shiba's roadmap targets scalability and DeFi, actual adoption is still not extensive. That's partly why even big SHIB holders are investigating alternatives. Projections do not indicate SHIB crossing $0.00003 anytime in the near future, and competition for memecoins is increasing. The majority desire projects like RTX with precise use cases and tokenomics reflecting real-world financial systems. 

A shop owner in Eastern Europe, for example, already uses Remittix to accept USD settlements from crypto customers through their dashboard interface.

Shiba Inu's price wave taught traders the lesson of how quickly hype can be forgotten. As of 2025, returns are driven by utility, not virality. For this reason, there's more capital flowing into Remittix, a project that is addressing real financial problems with faster returns.

Take advantage of the 50% bonus at Remittix now—before the rest of crypto wakes up.

An address beginning with 0xa31 has spent the week leaning hard against the alt-market on Hyperliquid.

Since 12 June the trader has opened shorts on 16 different tokens worth a combined $57.5 million and is already sitting on roughly $3.56 million in unrealised gains—plus another $2.27 million collected in funding fees.

Most of the downside bet is aimed at large-cap names such as ETH, DOGE, PEPE and XRP. So far DOGE has delivered the biggest win at $2.49 million, with the XRP position close behind at $1.41 million.

The lone outlier is a short on HYPE, currently underwater by about $3.19 million.

Alongside the headline names, the whale is also short smaller or novelty tokens including PEPE, FARTCOIN, LEFT, SUI, INIT, LAUNCHCOIN, PENGU, WLD, POPcat, LTC and MOODENG, as well as Bitcoin itself, bringing the running tally to sixteen separate positions—fourteen of which are in the black at press time.

Home » Figure's $355M Blockchain Securitization Earns S&P Ratings

Figure Technology Solutions has announced the successful securitization of $355 million in mortgage assets through its latest transaction, designated FIGRE 2025-HE3. The deal has gained particular attention in financial markets due to its distinction as the first blockchain-based mortgage securitization to receive ratings from S&P Global Ratings across all six bond classes, spanning from AAA to B-.

The company described the transaction as a milestone for both its asset strategy and the broader blockchain-backed financial infrastructure it is developing. According to Figure's capital management leadership, achieving top-tier ratings from S&P serves as a strong indicator of institutional confidence in the company's blockchain-driven approach to structuring and issuing financial products. The team emphasized that the credibility of blockchain as a secure and efficient foundation for financial transactions is continuing to gain validation.

FIGRE 2025-HE3 attracted participation from more than 30 distinct institutional investors, including insurance companies, credit funds, and asset managers. The AAA-rated tranche saw particularly high interest, pointing to increased trust in Figure's ability to deliver consistent, high-quality issuances. All bond classes in the offering were reported as oversubscribed, highlighting strong market appetite.

An important aspect of the transaction was that all the mortgage collateral was sourced through Figure Connect, the company's blockchain-based marketplace. Figure itself did not contribute any collateral to the deal. This development signals rising acceptance of decentralized platforms for asset origination and transfer. The company noted that this model aims to position them as a reliable and transparent issuer, which is a key consideration for its diverse investor base.

— Figure (@Figure) June 12, 2025

 


The mortgage loans backing the securitization were processed using the Provenance Blockchain, which Figure uses to streamline underwriting and improve visibility into the transaction lifecycle. This technological layer has been credited with enhancing the speed, accuracy, and transparency of the overall securitization process.

This latest offering marks the fourth home equity line of credit (HELOC) securitization from Figure in 2025, indicating the company's sustained growth and influence in the market. Since launching Figure Connect in June 2024, the firm has observed a notable increase in investor engagement, attributed in part to the platform's efficiency and more favorable yield structure compared to traditional non-qualified mortgage offerings.

Further supporting its expansion, Figure recently entered into a joint venture with Sixth Street, securing a liquidity commitment exceeding $2 billion. This strategic partnership aims to reinforce Figure's ability to bridge the gap between conventional finance and blockchain innovation. The collaboration is expected to enhance the firm's capability to scale its securitization operations while maintaining high standards in execution and transparency.

With its digital infrastructure offering cost efficiencies and faster execution timelines, Figure continues to be a leader in bringing blockchain into the core of structured finance. Through initiatives like FIGRE 2025-HE3, the company is setting new precedents for how asset-backed securities can be originated, rated, and traded in the evolving financial landscape.

The gaming community is no stranger to innovation, but when Web3 and NFTs entered the scene, a fierce backlash emerged — especially from traditional gamers. Despite the hype surrounding blockchain technology, many players remain skeptical or openly hostile toward these new developments. Understanding why this backlash exists sheds light on broader issues of trust, game design, and player expectations.

Web3 refers to the vision of a decentralized internet built on blockchain technology, where users have ownership and control over their data and digital assets. In gaming, Web3 manifests through Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), cryptocurrencies, and decentralized marketplaces, enabling players to truly own in-game items, trade them freely, and even earn real money while playing.

Proponents argue this new model democratizes gaming economies and rewards player investment and creativity. Platforms like 777 embrace these principles, offering innovative gaming experiences blending fun with economic opportunities.

However, the promise of Web3 often clashes with traditional gaming values.

For many longtime gamers, the primary reason to play is enjoyment — whether through story, challenge, or social interaction. When games become centered around financial speculation or trading digital assets, it feels like a betrayal. Instead of escaping into a crafted world, players feel pushed into a marketplace.

This shift changes the nature of gameplay, transforming what used to be a leisurely pastime into a transactional activity. Players often express frustration that their gaming time turns into a grind for monetary gain rather than enjoyment.

The history of gaming is littered with microtransactions, loot boxes, and other monetization schemes. Many players worry NFTs are just the next iteration of pay-to-win tactics, where those willing or able to spend more money gain unfair advantages.

Research from Pew Research Center shows a strong preference among gamers for skill-based progression over monetary shortcuts, highlighting the sensitivity to these concerns. Players fear that blockchain integration may introduce new ways for companies to monetize at the expense of fair competition.

The environmental footprint of blockchain technology also fuels the backlash. Early blockchains, particularly those using proof-of-work consensus like Ethereum (before its upgrade), consumed vast amounts of energy. Gamers aware of climate change worries often associate NFTs with unnecessary ecological harm. Despite advances in greener blockchain solutions, this stigma remains hard to shake.

Scientific discussions on blockchain energy consumption and its environmental impact can be explored in depth in studies such as this one available on arXiv.

A significant part of the backlash is cultural. Web3 gamers often come from crypto-native or tech-forward backgrounds, familiar with blockchain's nuances and more willing to experiment. Traditional gamers, especially those invested in narrative-driven or competitive games, often see Web3 as an intrusion into their communities.

This divide manifests in online forums, social media, and game reviews. Studies on gamer demographics show younger players, particularly Gen Z, are more open to Web3 innovations, while older players tend to resist them.

The communication gap between these groups exacerbates tensions. Web3 advocates may underestimate how deeply traditional gamers value legacy game design principles, while traditional gamers may dismiss Web3's potential too quickly.

Many gamers see NFTs as a monetization tool rather than a gameplay enhancement. Years of microtransactions, loot boxes, and pay-to-win mechanics have fostered skepticism. Introducing NFTs can feel like yet another scheme to extract money, distracting from the immersive, skill-based experience players cherish. Traditional players emphasize enjoyment and mastery, not financial speculation.

Moreover, some major gaming studios like GSC Game World canceled NFT plans for games such as S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 due to overwhelming community criticism, demonstrating the strong resistance within the core gamer demographic. You can find detailed information on blockchain games and their controversies at Wikipedia's Blockchain game page.

While many gamers reject NFTs, some applications have found limited success or potential:

Still, these use cases require thoughtful design and transparency to avoid the pitfalls of greed-driven exploitation.

Building trust is paramount. Here are some approaches the industry could take to bridge the gap:

Interestingly, some blockchain-native studios are building games from scratch with NFTs as a core feature rather than an add-on. This approach allows game mechanics to naturally integrate ownership and economic aspects, potentially avoiding many pitfalls of retrofitting existing titles.

Platforms like 777 showcase how gaming and blockchain can blend to create engaging experiences that respect player autonomy and fun.

Moreover, the rise of “play-to-earn” models offers new economic opportunities, especially in regions where gaming income can impact livelihoods. This global perspective suggests NFTs might gain traction unevenly worldwide.

The NFT backlash among traditional gamers isn't merely resistance to change — it reflects deep concerns about the soul of gaming. The challenge for Web3 advocates is to demonstrate that blockchain can add meaningful value without undermining what players love.

The future of gaming may well be a hybrid landscape, where NFTs and blockchain coexist alongside traditional games, each serving different audiences and preferences.

Platforms like 777 exemplify attempts to blend engaging gameplay with new economic models, but the path forward requires dialogue, respect, and innovation that prioritizes player experience.

The gaming world is evolving, and whether NFTs and Web3 become mainstream or niche, the conversation they sparked will shape the future of digital entertainment.

Hong Kong's central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiative, known as e-HKD+, has entered a groundbreaking phase with the integration of Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). This pilot program demonstrates the transformative potential of blockchain technology in facilitating secure, efficient cross-border transactions between permissioned and permissionless blockchains. With major financial institutions like Visa, ANZ, Fidelity International, and ChinaAMC participating, the study highlights the growing institutional interest in tokenized assets and programmable digital currencies.

The e-HKD+ program, launched by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), aims to explore the use cases of a digital Hong Kong dollar. Phase Two of the initiative focuses on programmability, tokenization, and near real-time settlement of transactions. By leveraging Chainlink's CCIP, the pilot program seeks to address key challenges in cross-border payments, such as counterparty risk and settlement delays.

Programmability: Enables automated execution of complex financial transactions.

Tokenization: Facilitates the creation of digital representations of real-world assets.

Atomic Settlement: Ensures simultaneous transaction completion, reducing risks.

Chainlink's CCIP serves as the backbone of the e-HKD+ pilot, enabling seamless communication between private and public blockchain environments. The protocol allows for secure data and value transfers without the need for traditional asset bridging, solving critical interoperability challenges.

Stablecoin Conversion: Australian investors deposit AUD and receive A$DC tokens on ANZ's private blockchain (DASchain).

e-HKD Issuance: ANZ purchases e-HKD from HKMA, which is then wrapped and transferred to investors.

Atomic Settlement: CCIP facilitates the simultaneous exchange of A$DC and e-HKD, ensuring secure and instant transactions.

The pilot program is backed by leading financial institutions, each contributing to its execution and success:

Visa: Provided its Tokenized Asset Platform (VTAP) for managing the digital money lifecycle.

ANZ: Issued the A$DC stablecoin and connected its proprietary blockchain to Ethereum's testnet.

Fidelity International and ChinaAMC: Demonstrated the application of tokenized funds in streamlining investment processes.

Reduced Settlement Time: Transactions are completed in seconds, compared to days in traditional systems.

Enhanced Security: On-chain identity verification ensures compliance and reduces fraud.

Operational Efficiency: Supports transactions outside standard business hours, including weekends and holidays.

While interest in CBDCs among central banks has cooled globally, Hong Kong's e-HKD+ program showcases their potential in institutional finance. Tokenized assets and stablecoins are projected to reach market sizes of $10 trillion and $3.7 trillion, respectively, by 2030. These advancements promise to boost global liquidity and transparency.

Public Adoption: CBDCs face skepticism among private citizens due to concerns over privacy and centralization.

Institutional Use Cases: Financial institutions are increasingly adopting blockchain solutions for their efficiency and security.

Chainlink's CCIP has proven to be a pivotal technology in Hong Kong's e-HKD+ pilot, bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized ecosystems. By enabling secure, instant cross-border transactions, the protocol is setting a new standard for CBDC interoperability. As the findings from this study are expected by late 2025, the success of this pilot could pave the way for broader adoption of blockchain-based financial solutions.

Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is a blockchain technology that enables secure communication and value transfer between different blockchain networks.

e-HKD+ reduces settlement times, enhances security through on-chain identity verification, and supports transactions outside standard business hours.

Tokenized assets are expected to reach $10 trillion, while stablecoins may grow to $3.7 trillion by 2030.

CBDCs are often criticized for their lack of anonymity and centralization, which raises privacy concerns.

Chainlink provided its CCIP infrastructure to enable atomic settlement and secure cross-border transactions between A$DC and e-HKD.","{'href': 'https://www.okx.com', 'title': 'OKX'}","cryptocurrency"

Key Points

One of the hottest tech stocks in recent years has been MicroStrategy (MSTR 0.65%), which has rebranded itself as just Strategy. And a huge reason for its rally has been due to its bullish position on Bitcoin (BTC 0.82%) and its continual stockpiling of the digital currency. With the cryptocurrency soaring in value in recent years and breaching the $100,000 mark, Strategy has benefited from that excitement.

But there's a fundamental problem with this approach. While it seems like a great way to benefit from the cryptocurrency's rising value, simply loading up on Bitcoins may not necessarily result in a higher share price for Strategy. In fact, it could end up hurting the stock down the road.

Image source: Getty Images.

Strategy is the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, with its tally sitting at 582,000 Bitcoins as of June 9. Last year, it announced plans to raise as much as $42 billion, over a three-year period, in an effort to add to its crypto position, through a combination of both debt and equity. It shows a strong commitment to the digital currency, which has made the stock a popular option for crypto investors to load up on themselves. 

In five years, Strategy's stock has risen by over 3,000% while Bitcoin is up around 970%. And Executive Chairman Michael Saylor believes that through Bitcoin's rising valuation (he believes it'll surpass a price of $1 million in the future), Strategy may one day reach a valuation of $10 trillion. Today, its market cap is around $110 billion. 

But it may not be easy for Strategy to continue with its Bitcoin-buying spree if the digital currency soars in value.

Strategy routinely purchases Bitcoins, but its average cost is now around $70,000. The company hasn't simply been buying Bitcoins at lower prices, it has also been loading up on them when the price has been above $100,000. The long-term problem is that the higher that Bitcoin goes in value, the more expensive it becomes for the company to add to its position.

For investors, the problem centers around the need for ongoing capital raises. Right now, that may not be a big concern given how well Strategy's stock has been doing -- it's up around 150% in just the past 12 months. But stock offerings dilute existing shareholders and given Strategy's long-term plans to continually add Bitcoins, it has the potential to create an endless cycle of stock offerings followed by Bitcoin purchases. If the stock starts to slow down and can't keep up with a rising valuation for Bitcoin, it can result in greater share offerings necessary to fund future Bitcoin purchases. And the larger those offerings are, the more significant the downward pressure will be on the stock.

The company sells business intelligence and analytics software but its core operations don't generate cash; Strategy has burned through more than $84 million just from its day-to-day operations over the past 12 months. Once you factor in its investing activities, which include Bitcoin purchases, the company's cash outflow ramps up to well over $28 billion.

Rather than investing in a company because it hold Bitcoins, investors may want to consider directly investing in Bitcoin. Through spot exchange-traded funds, it's easier than ever to get a position in the cryptocurrency without worrying about digital wallets and having to remember complex passwords. Strategy's stock comes with added risk because more companies these days are also buying Bitcoin, and especially as its valuation creeps higher, investors may start to pivot from Strategy and into more modestly priced stocks that may possess greater upside.

While investing in the tech stock has yielded great returns for investors thus far, that doesn't mean that pattern will continue, especially with its valuation now topping more than $100 billion. Without stronger fundamentals, Strategy is purely a speculative play involving crypto, which makes this an ultra-risky stock to be hanging on to, one that's likely not going to be suitable for the vast majority of investors.

The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon and Walmart are planning to launch their own stablecoins, joining the ranks of companies like PayPal, Meta, Ant Group, and Stripe. Once considered a niche crypto innovation, stablecoins are now at the center of a growing revolution in digital payments and commerce.

This shift isn't just about technology — it's about reclaiming control over payments. When household names like Amazon and Walmart explore stablecoins, it's clear that the future of money is being shaped not by banks or governments, but by corporate innovators.

Stablecoins offer instant, borderless, low-cost transactions — unlike credit cards, which typically charge merchants 2–3.5% per transaction. For a retailer doing $100 billion in annual sales, that's $2–3.5 billion in fees. With stablecoins:

This is why companies like Shopify have already enabled USDC payments on Coinbase's Base, empowering global merchants to accept stablecoins without legacy payment infrastructure.

The U.S. Senate is now preparing to vote on new stablecoin legislation, a move that could legitimize — or restrict — this new financial frontier. Regulators like Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal have already raised concerns, especially with Meta's renewed efforts.

Yet the reality remains: governments don't easily surrender monetary control, and stablecoins represent a challenge to centralized financial power. But as with the internet before it, decentralization of money seems inevitable.

A stablecoin is a blockchain-based digital currency typically pegged to the U.S. dollar or another fiat currency. Examples include:

These coins maintain a 1:1 value ratio by backing each token with equivalent reserves. When properly regulated, they allow for safe, fast, and transparent transfers of value.

For many advocates, stablecoins represent more than efficiency — they're about freedom and control over one's money. As one libertarian perspective puts it:

“Whether transferring ₹100 or ₹10,000 crore, individuals should be able to move funds instantly, globally, and securely — without needing permission from a central bank.”

This vision is no longer theoretical. It's being built today — by the world's largest corporations and blockchain developers, side by side.

Stablecoins are no longer experimental. With Amazon, Walmart, Meta, and others entering the race, they're becoming the digital backbone of modern commerce. Whether governments embrace them or fight to control them, the global movement toward decentralized, efficient, and programmable money is gaining momentum fast.","{'href': 'https://munsifdaily.com', 'title': 'munsifdaily.com'}","cryptocurrency"

 Vietnam has passed a sweeping digital technology law that legalizes crypto assets and outlines incentives for AI, semiconductors, and infrastructure. 

The National Assembly of Vietnam approved the Law on Digital Technology Industry on June 14, bringing digital assets under regulatory oversight.

The legislation, set to take effect on Jan. 1, 2026, recognizes crypto assets and lays the groundwork for broader digital innovation across the country, according to reports from local media outlets.

The law classifies digital assets into two categories, including virtual assets and crypto assets. While both rely on encryption or digital technologies for validation and transfer, neither includes securities, digital fiat currencies, or other financial instruments.

The government is now tasked with outlining specific business conditions, classifications, and oversight mechanisms for these asset types.

The law also mandates cybersecurity and Anti-Money Laundering safeguards aligned with international norms, an effort likely aimed at addressing the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) concerns. Vietnam has been on the FATF “gray list” since 2023.

Beyond crypto, the legislation signals Vietnam's ambition to become a digital tech hub.

It introduces sweeping incentives for enterprises working in AI, semiconductors, and digital infrastructure. These include tax breaks, land-use benefits, and R&D support, particularly for firms building core technologies like chip design and AI data centers.

Regional governments are directed to support workforce development through subsidies and training programs, while education policies will integrate digital tech skills into national curricula.

“With this move, Viet Nam has become the first country in the world to enact a standalone law specifically dedicated to digital technology industry,” the Vietnamese government said.

Crypto World News

June 15, 2025 by Vaigha Varghese 

Crypto markets are entering a new phase of accumulation, with select altcoins setting the stage for potentially explosive growth. Bitcoin is facing major resistance at $72,000, and Ethereum is inching toward $3,000. But the spotlight is shifting. Early buyers are hunting for strong fundamentals, application-layer dominance, and platforms solving real-world issues.

Among those drawing the most attention this week are Qubetics, Aptos, Solana, and Cosmos. They're real infrastructure projects with use cases, network activity, and expanding ecosystems. Qubetics in particular is setting itself apart with its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace and a crypto presale that's closing in on a major milestone. Let's dive into why these are the best crypto coins to buy right now and how each project is shaping the Web3 frontier.

Qubetics is laying the rails for one of blockchain's most compelling real-world use cases—tokenizing tangible assets into digital ownership units. The Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace is built to turn real estate, equity shares, fine art, and precious metals into blockchain-registered assets, allowing people and businesses to buy, sell, and trade fractions globally.

Professionals in supply chain, logistics, and capital markets are also using the protocol to enhance asset liquidity, digitize balance sheets, and manage compliance more efficiently. With verified identity features, asset vaulting, and AI-powered auditing, Qubetics is positioned as a compliance-ready launchpad for real-world finance.

In the past 30 days, Qubetics has added 1,100+ tokenized asset pools to its beta platform. The marketplace has recorded $82 million in simulation volume and signed preliminary deals with logistics firms in Singapore and estate developers in Dubai.

Institutional access layers have been introduced for banks and family offices, featuring KYC/AML-compliant APIs. A recent technical update has also improved node reliability by 18% across Europe and Southeast Asia, expanding validator access and reducing operational latency. The development team confirmed that conversations with regulators in the EU and UAE are progressing steadily.

The Qubetics crypto presale is nearing its end—and it's gaining serious momentum. Now in Stage 37, the project has raised more than $18 million, distributed over 515 million $TICS tokens, and onboarded 27,900+ participants. Just 10 million tokens remain before the listing.

The presale price of $0.3370 is fixed.After that, the token will list publicly at $0.40—offering a 20% price bump to those who lock in now. This final-stage urgency is further compounded by the reduced total supply. From over 4 billion tokens, the new cap stands at 1.36 billion. With only 38.55% allocated for public circulation, Qubetics is positioning itself as a supply-constrained utility asset.

For a $2,500 allocation at the current stage, returns could reach $74,925 if $TICS hits $10. Should it climb to $15 post-mainnet—as forecasted by analysts following its cross-border utility expansion—returns could exceed $112,000. With fundamentals in place and the presale closing fast, strategic buyers are locking in early while they still can.

Why did this coin make it to this list: Qubetics is solving a real problem with an elegant, scalable solution. Its RWA marketplace, proven rollout strategy, and crypto presale structure make it one of the best crypto coins to buy in June 2025.

Aptos was developed to address a critical gap in Layer-1 architecture—how to process transactions faster, safer, and more efficiently. Using a parallel execution engine and the Move programming language (originally built by Meta engineers), Aptos can handle thousands of simultaneous transactions with high throughput and low latency.

Its modular architecture allows for independent updates to consensus, execution, and data storage. This design is gaining popularity among fintech apps, gaming platforms, and high-frequency trading protocols needing low response times.

APT is currently trading around $4.63–$4.70, reflecting a 3.4% monthly decline. Technical patterns suggest a make-or-break point, with $4.24 and $3.99 acting as key support zones. If Aptos breaks above $5.00, bullish momentum may resume and push prices toward $6.50 or higher.

While competition from chains like Celestia and Sui has diluted hype, renewed developer onboarding and capital flows into the Aptos ecosystem suggest a potential reversal. Recent growth in dApp development—especially in Asia—is helping to offset bearish sentiment.

Why did this coin make it to this list: Aptos is a next-gen Layer-1 with real performance advantages. Despite market headwinds, its technology base makes it one of the best crypto coins to buy during consolidation.

Solana is built for speed—and it delivers. With block times of 400ms and transaction costs below $0.01, Solana supports a high-throughput, low-latency ecosystem for DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 gaming. What distinguishes Solana is its ability to scale without Layer-2 dependencies, thanks to its core validator structure and Sealevel parallel execution engine.

Recently, Solana has seen increased support from institutional players. Analysts at Ark Invest and Franklin Templeton have identified Solana as a core asset alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum in future digital portfolios.

Solana recently surged to $153.76 and is eyeing a breakout above the psychological $160 resistance level. If breached, price targets at $178 and $182 become attainable. RSI trends are neutral, but rising volume suggests strong buyer momentum.

Technical analysts have confirmed a bullish breakout from a symmetrical triangle, validating the case for further upward movement. Solana's volume strength and social sentiment also continue to outpace other Layer-1s in the short term.

Why did this coin make it to this list: Solana's unmatched speed and strong institutional backing secure its position as one of the best crypto coins to buy as the market gears up for its next leg.

Cosmos is widely regarded as the backbone of multichain Web3. Its Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) allows independent blockchains to communicate and transfer assets without a central intermediary. This is critical in a world where fragmentation threatens blockchain composability.

Through Cosmos SDK, developers can build sovereign chains optimized for specific applications. Osmosis, Secret Network, and Akash all run on Cosmos, showcasing its flexibility and developer-friendliness.

ATOM has climbed 5.57% in the past month, breaking out from a prolonged consolidation. After falling over 54% in six months, Cosmos is now showing signs of sustained upward momentum. Support is strong near $3.73, while resistance looms at $6.11.

Fundamentally, Cosmos is expanding through governance reforms and new developer incentives. The upcoming ATOM 2.0 updates are expected to redefine staking and interchain scheduling, bringing in more efficiency and value capture for the token.

Why did this coin make it to this list: Cosmos offers unmatched cross-chain utility and modularity. As multichain coordination becomes vital, Cosmos remains one of the best crypto coins to buy for forward-looking participants.

These four projects—Qubetics, Aptos, Solana, and Cosmos—are high-utility platforms solving key challenges in speed, scalability, interoperability, and real-world adoption. Each has earned its spot as a front-runner in 2025's digital asset landscape.

Qubetics leads the charge by turning real-world assets into liquid, tradable blockchain tokens—and it's doing so with a scarcity-driven presale nearing its final stage. The current $0.3370 entry point offers a rare final window before public launch. Strategic entries today could shape the portfolios of tomorrow.

1. What is the primary use case of Qubetics? 

Qubetics enables the secure tokenization and trading of real-world assets like real estate and commodities through its RWA marketplace.

2. Why is Aptos different from other Layer-1s?

 Aptos uses a parallel execution engine and Move language to optimize transaction speed and on-chain safety.

3. What gives Solana its performance edge? 

Solana achieves ultra-fast transactions and low fees without relying on Layer-2 chains, using Sealevel for parallel processing.

4. How does Cosmos enable cross-chain compatibility?

 Cosmos uses IBC to allow independent blockchains to exchange data and assets natively.

5.  Is the Qubetics presale still active? Yes, Qubetics' presale is in Stage 37 with a price of $0.3370 until Sunday. Only 10 million tokens remain before the listing at $0.40.

Vietnam has approved a landmark bill to create a structured legal environment for digital assets. The new legislation, called the Law on Digital Technology Industry, will take effect in January 2026.

This lays the groundwork for regulated crypto activity and is designed to enable the growth of the emerging industry.

According to reports, the new law formally recognizes digital assets and divides them into two main categories of virtual assets and crypto assets.

Crypto assets are digital instruments that rely on encryption and blockchain technologies for creation, issuance, storage, and transfer. These include tokens used to validate transactions and verify ownership on distributed networks.

In contrast, virtual assets are used primarily for trading or investment purposes. They do not include instruments like securities, stablecoins, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), or other regulated financial products.

The legislation grants the government authority to define these asset classifications, set business conditions, and oversee their operations.

It also mandates relevant agencies to enforce strict anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) standards to protect the integrity of the ecosystem.

Beyond crypto regulation, the law lays a foundation for broader technological advancement. 

It introduces policies to strengthen Vietnam's digital infrastructure and foster growth in areas such as artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and high-tech manufacturing.

According to the report, technological firms working on digital products or advanced computing systems will gain access to various incentives. These include support for research and development, talent training, and collaborative infrastructure building.

This comprehensive approach aligns with Vietnam's ambition to become a competitive player in the digital economy. According to Chainalysis, the country currently ranks fifth worldwide in crypto adoption, demonstrating strong domestic demand.

Industry players believe that a formal framework will help Vietnam attract more investment and position itself as a serious contender alongside established blockchain hubs like Singapore.

Notably, Vietnam's regulatory push follows the Ministry of Finance's recent efforts to launch a pilot crypto trading platform with support from the Bybit crypto exchange.

Vietnam has officially legalized crypto assets under a new law passed by the National Assembly on June 14. The Law on Digital Technology Industry introduces a formal regulatory structure for digital assets and innovation. It will take effect on January 1, 2026, and aims to transform Vietnam's digital economy.

The law defines digital assets under two categories: crypto assets and virtual assets, which exclude digital fiat currencies and securities. Both asset types rely on encryption and digital technologies, but neither is classified as a financial instrument. The law mandates that the government develop regulations on classifications, business conditions, and supervision methods.

The legislation also includes cybersecurity provisions and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) controls that align with international practices. These measures are seen as a response to the Financial Action Task Force's concerns since Vietnam remains on its gray list. Authorities aim to improve transparency and reduce illicit finance risks through these compliance efforts.

Beyond digital assets, the law supports broader technological development with incentives for companies in AI, semiconductors, and infrastructure. Enterprises working on core technologies like chip design and AI data centers will receive tax breaks, land-use rights, and R&D funding. Regional governments are instructed to back this vision through workforce training, education reforms, and subsidies.

New policies require schools to include digital technology skills across the national curriculum to prepare future professionals. Workforce development will focus on high-tech sectors, especially where local talent gaps exist. As a result, both local and foreign firms are expected to benefit from Vietnam's push to modernize.

Vietnam's crypto sector has seen scams that highlight the need for legal clarity and investor protection. In February 2025, police arrested four suspects behind BitMiner, a fake crypto mining platform that defrauded over 200 people. Victims lost more than 4 billion dong through false mining packages and fake education tools.

In another case in December 2024, Hanoi police blocked a crypto scam involving 300 potential victims. The scheme, named Million Smiles, had already stolen 30 billion dong from hundreds of people and businesses. It falsely promoted a cryptocurrency called QFS using spiritual and deceptive marketing tactics.

""Hey bitcoin, Do Something!"" 

The viral meme — starring a stick figure poking the ground and depicting a need for reaction — might just sum up the current scene at digital assets trading desks during the slow, early summer days. 

Sure, bitcoin BTC$105,592.48 just hit new fresh highs and is still trading above $100,000, but the P&L is diminishing daily for short-term volatility chasers. 

""Bitcoin's volatility has continued to trend lower, both in realized and implied measures, even as the asset reaches new all-time highs. This decline in volatility is particularly notable amid historically high price levels,"" said NYDIG Research in a recent note shared with CoinDesk.

And despite macro and geopolitical headwinds hitting traditional assets hard, bitcoin has gone into a chill summer vibe. 

""With the market now entering the typically quieter summer months, this downtrend may well persist in the near term,"" NYDIG added. 

Of course, this is perhaps a positive trend for bitcoin as it depicts a more maturing market and potentially speaks to its original promise of ""store of value,"" as the price reaches fresh new highs. 

However, traders love volatility, as the greater the movement, the bigger the P&L opportunities are. While fresh record highs might be great for long-term HODLers, for short-term traders, those juicy breakouts are getting hard to make money on. 

So what's driving these calm price actions?

NYDIG is chalking it up to increased demand from bitcoin treasury companies, which seem to be popping up everywhere, and a rise in sophisticated trading strategies, such as options overwriting, as well as other forms of volatility selling. 

The market is getting more professional, and unless we see some true Black Swan events (FTX, anyone?) for crypto, prices will continue to remain calm. 

But all is not lost — there are always opportunities to make money even when it's not as lucrative as it seems. 

""The decline in volatility has made both upside exposure through calls and downside protection via puts relatively inexpensive,"" said NYDIG. 

Translation: Hedging and catalyst-driven plays are where the money might be in this market. If one thinks something big is coming, this is perhaps the time to position with directional bets. And there are a few big ones coming. 

""For traders anticipating market-moving catalysts, such as the SEC's decision on the GDLC conversion (July 2), the conclusion of the 90-day tariff suspension (July 8), or the Crypto Working Group's findings deadline (July 22), this presents a cost-effective opportunity to position for directional moves,"" said NYDIG. 

So bitcoin's summer lull might not be a total dead zone; rather, it's a setup for those who are willing to play the patience game and hedge accordingly to trade potential market-moving events.

Shiba inu's (SHIB) supply-side dynamics are screaming bullish, yet the second-largest joke cryptocurrency by market value trades under pressure.

Early this week, SHIB's burn rate surged to over 112,000%, with more than 116 million coins transferred to wallets that cannot spend money. In other words, these coins were permanently taken out of circulation. 

The daily burn rate refers to the number of SHIB tokens permanently destroyed or removed from circulation each day. Token burns are designed to decrease the supply of the cryptocurrency over time, bringing a deflationary appeal to the digital asset.

""Over 527 trillion SHIB tokens are approaching profitability, while the burn rate exploded 112,839% with 116 million tokens removed from circulation,"" CoinDesk's AI insights noted.

Furthermore, SHIB's ecosystem fundamentals demonstrated strength, with record wallet growth exceeding 1.5 million unique addresses and significant increases in Shibarium layer-2 transactions.

Still, the memecoin remained locked in a downtrend at press time, last changing hands at $0.00001190, representing a 2% drop over the past 24 hours and a nearly 5% decline for the week.

Overnight, the token faced strong selling pressure, with above-average volume exceeding 500 billion units, establishing resistance around $0.0000122.

Bitcoin (BTC) BTC$105,592.48 is holding firm above $105,000 after recovering from a sharp downturn triggered by escalating tensions in the Middle East. The leading cryptocurrency dropped below $104,000 following Israel's strike on Iran, but quickly regained lost ground, now trading at $105,590, up 0.15% in the past 24 hours.

Bitcoin's swift rebound suggests underlying strength, with high-volume buying visible during the dip. Analysts point to the $104,000–$105,000 range as an important zone of support, as price action continues to grind upward. Sentiment remains cautious — reflected in a pullback in trader confidence — but structurally, bitcoin's trend remains intact.

Beyond near-term volatility, bitcoin continues to capture the imagination of a younger generation of investors. In a recent episode of the Unchained podcast, Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise Asset Management, described how bitcoin's appeal increasingly transcends traditional financial goals.

According to Park, many younger people no longer aspire to own suburban homes or pursue the white-picket-fence ideal. Instead, they're focused on becoming ""wholecoiners"" — those who own at least one full bitcoin — as a new form of prestige and long-term security. For some, the goal even extends beyond personal wealth to securing a financial legacy across generations, reflecting the popular meme of ""retiring your bloodline.""

Park added that bitcoin's global, apolitical nature is central to this shift. It offers a shared value system, allowing people worldwide to ""opt out"" of systems they no longer trust. That sentiment is fueling a cultural pivot: bitcoin is no longer just a hedge or speculative asset, but for many, it has become a social signal of financial independence and self-sovereignty.

As BTC holds above $105K and macro catalysts loom, the contrast between short-term fear and long-term conviction has rarely been sharper.

 Vietnam has passed a sweeping digital technology law that legalizes crypto assets and outlines incentives for AI, semiconductors, and infrastructure. 

The National Assembly of Vietnam approved the Law on Digital Technology Industry on June 14, bringing digital assets under regulatory oversight.

The legislation, set to take effect on Jan. 1, 2026, recognizes crypto assets and lays the groundwork for broader digital innovation across the country, according to reports from local media outlets.

The law classifies digital assets into two categories, including virtual assets and crypto assets. While both rely on encryption or digital technologies for validation and transfer, neither includes securities, digital fiat currencies, or other financial instruments.

The government is now tasked with outlining specific business conditions, classifications, and oversight mechanisms for these asset types.

The law also mandates cybersecurity and Anti-Money Laundering safeguards aligned with international norms, an effort likely aimed at addressing the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) concerns. Vietnam has been on the FATF “gray list” since 2023.

Beyond crypto, the legislation signals Vietnam's ambition to become a digital tech hub.

It introduces sweeping incentives for enterprises working in AI, semiconductors, and digital infrastructure. These include tax breaks, land-use benefits, and R&D support, particularly for firms building core technologies like chip design and AI data centers.

Regional governments are directed to support workforce development through subsidies and training programs, while education policies will integrate digital tech skills into national curricula.

“With this move, Viet Nam has become the first country in the world to enact a standalone law specifically dedicated to digital technology industry,” the Vietnamese government said.

In Feb. 2025, Vietnamese police arrested four individuals behind a fake crypto mining platform, BitMiner, which posed as a Dubai-based operation. The scam tricked over 200 victims out of more than 4 billion Vietnamese dong ($157,300) by selling bogus mining packages and education materials.

In another major incident in December 2024, the Hanoi City Police Department in Vietnam prevented 300 potential victims from investing in an elaborate crypto scam that had already defrauded 30 billion Vietnamese dong ($1.17 million) from about 100 businesses and 400 individuals.

Dubbed Million Smiles, the company promoted an in-house cryptocurrency, QFS, or Quantum Financial System, using deceptive advertising that linked it to ancestral treasures and spiritual claims.

 From golden crosses to ascending wedges, Bitcoin traders are increasingly optimistic on the future of Bitcoin price action, even as the market tracks sideways. 

Key points:

Bitcoin traders eye new all-time highs, which include $270,000 by October.

The bull run is far from over, they agree, with BTC price due a major comeback.

Doubts persist over the impact of the next Bitcoin bear market.

Bitcoin (BTC) traders still see new all-time highs and even $270,000 this bull market.

The latest BTC price forecasts from popular market participants agree that BTC/USD is due to head much higher than its current record.

Bitcoin may be consolidating just above $100,000 after a slew of macroeconomic and geopolitical surprises, but the consensus among traders is anything but bearish.

Far from the bull market being over, many see Bitcoin preparing for a fresh period of price discovery.

“Bitcoin is trending upward in an Ascending Broadening Wedge,” popular trader Alan Tardigrade concluded in part of his latest analysis on June 15.

An accompanying chart showed a recurring pattern on weekly timeframes stretching back to the start of the bull market in early 2023.

Another chart, this time the daily, flagged a so-called “golden cross” — where the 50-day simple moving average crosses over the 200-day equivalent.

“This signal has boosted $BTC by 49%, 125%, and 68% since 2023 whenever it has occurred,” Tardigrade commented.

Such perspectives are far from rare in the current market. Even those waiting for an initial drop to test support ultimately see a rebound taking Bitcoin to new highs.

Continuing, fellow trader Merlijn identified a classic price-bottoming structure in the form of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern still playing out.

“Breakout target? $140K+,” he told X followers this week.

As Cointelegraph continues to report, however, some parties hold increasing doubts over the bull run's true support.

Comparisons to the end of the last bull market in late 2021 have begun to surface, and the area around all-time highs continues to deliver price rejections with ease.

In a nod to future bear markets, one of the best-known Bitcoin bulls, “The Bitcoin Standard” author Saifedean Ammous, cautioned corporate buyers over the realities of BTC exposure earlier this month.

“I just hope my message out there to everybody in this business is, Bitcoin has done -70% and -80% before, and it can do it again,” he told the Coin Stories podcast during the Bitcoin 2025 conference.

 While the index remains in the “Greed” zone if history repeats following last year's Israel-Iran tensions, it may decline into “Fear” in the coming weeks. 

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which tracks overall crypto market sentiment, has remained in the “greed” zone despite rising geopolitical tensions after Israel launched a series of airstrikes on Iran.

The Index posted a score of 60 in its Sunday update, maintaining its position in the greed territory despite Bitcoin (BTC) falling 2.8% to $103,000 on Friday. This followed explosions reportedly heard in Tehran at 10:50 pm UTC on Thursday, which Israel claimed responsibility for. Iran reportedly retaliated with “dozens of ballistic missiles” on Friday night.

On Thursday, the Index was holding a Greed score of 71.

Bitcoin's price decline came as it was edging closer to retesting its May 22 all-time high of $111,970. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $105,540, according to CoinMarketCap.

Ether (ETH), meanwhile, dropped 10.79% over the same period to a low of $2,454 before recovering to $2,534 at the time of publication.

Crypto market participants pointed out Bitcoin's relative strength given the circumstances. Crypto analyst Za said in a Saturday X post, “Bitcoin does not seem concerned about the Israel and Iran conflict (yet).” 

“There is no better indicator than Bitcoin, which makes this notable, in my opinion,” Za said.

Crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano said in a post on the same day, “Bitcoin is relentless.”

Traders appear to be holding confidence that it will remain above the psychological $100,000 price level, which it reclaimed on May 8 for the first time in three months. A drop below this price level could put over $1.74 billion in long positions at risk of liquidation, according to data from CoinGlass.

Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) posted a straight week of inflows for the trading week ending Friday, accumulating $1.37 billion in inflows over the five days, according to Farside data.

However, spot Ether ETFs ended its 19-day inflow streak on Friday, with net outflows of $2.1 million.

Bitcoin's price decline following the airstrike on Friday was less severe than in April 2024, when Iran launched an unprecedented direct attack on Israel.

The strike, which was a retaliatory measure against Israeli bombings of the Iranian embassy in Damascus, sent the price of BTC plummeting 8.4% on April 13, 2024. 

Although the index registered a “Greed” score of 72 on the same day, it had dropped to a “Fear” score of 43 by May 2, 2024.

 Brazil scraps crypto tax exemption for small traders, enforces flat 17.5% rate across all gains, including self-custody and offshore holdings. 

Brazil has ended its tax exemption for small-scale crypto profits, introducing a 17.5% flat rate on all capital gains from digital assets. The new rule was announced under Provisional Measure 1303 as part of the government's push to raise revenue through financial market taxation.

Until now, Brazilian residents who sold up to 35,000 Brazilian reals (roughly $6,300) in crypto assets per month were exempt from income tax. Gains beyond that were taxed progressively, starting at 15% and reaching as high as 22.5% for volumes above 30 million Brazilian reals.

The new flat rate, which went into effect starting June 12, removes all exemptions and applies equally to all investors regardless of the size of their transactions, according to a report by local news outlet Portal do Bitcoin.

While smaller investors will now face higher tax burdens, high-net-worth individuals could end up paying less. Under the previous system, large trades, those exceeding 5 million Brazilian reals, were taxed between 17.5% and 22.5%. With a uniform 17.5% rate now in effect, many large investors will see their effective tax rate drop.

The provisional measure also expands the tax base. Crypto assets held in self-custody wallets and foreign crypto holdings are now included in the tax regime.

Per the report, taxation will be assessed quarterly, with investors allowed to offset losses from the previous five quarters. However, from 2026 onward, the window for loss deduction will be tightened.

The overhaul extends beyond crypto. Fixed income instruments, once exempt from income tax, such as Agribusiness and Real Estate Credit Letters (LCAs and LCIs), as well as Real Estate and Agribusiness Receivables Certificates (CRIs and CRAs), will now incur a 5% tax on profits.

Meanwhile, taxation on betting revenue has increased from 12% to 18%.

The finance ministry introduced these changes following backlash over an earlier attempt to hike the Financial Transaction Tax (IOF). That proposal was shelved after facing stiff opposition from both the market and Congress.

In March, Brazilian lawmakers put forward a proposal that would permit employers to pay workers partially in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC). Under the proposed rules, crypto payments cannot exceed 50% of an employee's salary.

Full crypto payments would only be allowed for foreign workers or contractors and only under specific conditions laid out by Brazil's central bank. The bill prohibits paying wages entirely in digital assets for standard employees.

The legislation would also permit independent contractors to receive full payment in crypto if agreed upon contractually. All crypto payouts must use official exchange rates from Central Bank-authorized institutions.

An international team of astronomers including researchers at the University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory has unveiled groundbreaking findings about the disks of gas and dust surrounding nearby young stars, using the powerful Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, or ALMA.

The findings, published in 12 papers in a focus issue of the Astrophysical Journal, are part of an ALMA large program called the ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks, or AGE-PRO. AGE-PRO observed 30 planet-forming disks around sunlike stars to measure gas disk mass at different ages. The study revealed that gas and dust components in these disks evolve at different rates.

Prior ALMA observations have examined the evolution of dust in disks; AGE-PRO, for the first time, traces the evolution of gas, providing the first measurements of gas disk masses and sizes across the lifetime of planet-forming disks, according to the project's principal investigator, Ke Zhang of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

""Now we have both, the gas and the dust,"" said Ilaria Pascucci, a professor at planetary sciences at the U of A and one of three AGE-PRO co-principal investigators. ""Observing the gas is much more difficult because it takes much more observing time, and that's why we have to go for a large program like this one to obtain a statistically significant sample.""

A protoplanetary disk swirls around its host star for several million years as its gas and dust evolve and dissipate, setting the timescale for giant planets to form. The disk's initial mass and size, as well as its angular momentum, have a profound influence on the type of planet it could form -- gas giants, icy giants or mini-Neptunes -- and migration paths of planets. The lifetime of the gas within the disk determines the timescale for the growth of dust particles to an object the size of an asteroid, the formation of a planet and finally the planet's migration from where it was born.

In one of the survey's most surprising findings, the team discovered that as disks age, their gas and dust are consumed at different rates and undergo a shift in gas-to-dust mass ratio as the disks evolve: Unlike the dust, which tends to remain inside the disk over a longer time span, the gas disperses relatively quickly, then more slowly as the disk ages. In other words, planet-forming disks blow off more of their gas when they're young.

Zhang said the most surprising finding is that although most disks dissipate after a few million years, the ones that survive have more gas than expected. This would suggest that gaseous planets like Jupiter have less time to form than rocky planets.

ALMA's unique sensitivity allowed researchers to use faint, so-called molecular lines to study the cold gas in these disks, characteristic wavelengths of a light spectrum that essentially act as ""fingerprints,"" identifying different species of gas molecules. The first large-scale chemical survey of its kind, AGE-PRO targeted 30 planet-forming disks in three star-forming regions, ranging from 1 million to 6 million years in age: Ophiuchus (youngest), Lupus (1-3 million years old), and Upper Scorpius (oldest). Using ALMA, AGE-PRO obtained observations of key tracers of gas and dust masses in disks spanning crucial stages of their evolution, from their earliest formation to their eventual dispersal. This ALMA data will serve as a comprehensive legacy library of spectral line observations for a large sample of disks at different evolutionary stages.

Dingshan Deng, a graduate student at LPL who is the lead author on one of the papers, provided the data reduction -- essentially, the image analyses needed to get from radio signals to optical images of the disks -- for the star-forming region in the constellation of Lupus (Latin for ""wolf"").

""Thanks to these new and long observations, we now have the ability to estimate and trace the gas masses, not only for the brightest and better studied disks in that region, but also the smaller and fainter ones,"" he said. ""Thanks to the discovery of gas tracers in many disks where it hadn't been seen before, we now have a well-studied sample covering a wide range of disk masses in the Lupus star-forming region.""

""It took years to figure out the proper data reduction approach and analysis to produce the images used in this paper for the gas masses and in many other papers of the collaboration,"" Pascucci added.

Carbon monoxide is the most widely used chemical tracer in protoplanetary disks, but to thoroughly measure the mass of gas in a disk, additional molecular tracers are needed. AGE-PRO used N2H+, or diazenylium, an ion used as an indicator for nitrogen gas in interstellar clouds, as an additional gas tracer to significantly improve the accuracy of measurements. ALMA's detections were also set up to receive spectral light signatures from other molecules, including formaldehyde, methyl cyanide and several molecular species containing deuterium, a hydrogen isotope.

""Another finding that surprised us was that the mass ratio between the gas and dust tends to be more consistent across disks of different masses than expected,"" Deng said. ""In other words, different-size disks will share a similar gas-to-dust mass ratio, whereas the literature suggested that smaller disks might shed their gas faster.""

Engineers at the University of California San Diego have developed a new cooling technology that could significantly improve the energy efficiency of data centers and high-powered electronics. The technology features a specially engineered fiber membrane that passively removes heat through evaporation. It offers a promising alternative to traditional cooling systems like fans, heat sinks and liquid pumps. It could also reduce the water use associated with many current cooling systems.

The advance is detailed in a paper published on June 13 in the journal Joule.

As artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing continue to expand, the demand for data processing -- and the heat it generates -- is skyrocketing. Currently, cooling accounts for up to 40% of a data center's total energy use. If trends continue, global energy use for cooling could more than double by 2030.

The new evaporative cooling technology could help curb that trend. It uses a low-cost fiber membrane with a network of tiny, interconnected pores that draw cooling liquid across its surface using capillary action. As the liquid evaporates, it efficiently removes heat from the electronics underneath -- no extra energy required. The membrane sits on top of microchannels above the electronics, pulling in liquid that flows through the channels and efficiently dissipating heat.

""Compared to traditional air or liquid cooling, evaporation can dissipate higher heat flux while using less energy,"" said Renkun Chen, professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering, who co-led the project with professors Shengqiang Cai and Abhishek Saha, both from the same department. Mechanical and aerospace engineering Ph.D. student Tianshi Feng and postdoctoral researcher Yu Pei, both members of Chen's research group, are co-first authors on the study.

Many applications currently rely on evaporation for cooling. Heat pipes in laptops and evaporators in air conditioners are some examples, explained Chen. But applying it effectively to high-power electronics has been a challenge. Previous attempts using porous membranes -- which have high surface areas that are ideal for evaporation -- have been unsuccessful because their pores were either too small they would clog or too large they would trigger unwanted boiling. ""Here, we use porous fiber membranes with interconnected pores with the right size,"" said Chen. This design achieves efficient evaporation without those downsides.

When tested across variable heat fluxes, the membrane achieved record-breaking performance. It managed heat fluxes exceeding 800 watts of heat per square centimeter -- one of the highest levels ever recorded for this kind of cooling system. It also proved stable over multiple hours of operation.

""This success showcases the potential of reimagining materials for entirely new applications,"" said Chen. ""These fiber membranes were originally designed for filtration, and no one had previously explored their use in evaporation. We recognized that their unique structural characteristics -- interconnected pores and just the right pore size -- could make them ideal for efficient evaporative cooling. What surprised us was that, with the right mechanical reinforcement, they not only withstood the high heat flux-they performed extremely well under it.""

While the current results are promising, Chen says the technology is still operating well below its theoretical limit. The team is now working to refine the membrane and optimize performance. Next steps include integrating it into prototypes of cold plates, which are flat components that attach to chips like CPUs and GPUs to dissipate heat. The team is also launching a startup company to commercialize the technology.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","AI Reveals Milky Way's Black Hole Spins Near Top Speed","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250614121952.htm","Sun, 15 Jun 2025 14:27:27 GMT","

An international team of astronomers has trained a neural network with millions of synthetic simulations and artificial intelligence (AI) to tease out new cosmic curiosities about black holes, revealing the one at the center of our Milky Way is spinning at nearly top speed.

These large ensembles of simulations were generated by throughput computing capabilities provided by the Center for High Throughput Computing (CHTC), a joint entity of the Morgridge Institute for Research and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The astronomers published their results and methodology today in three papers in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.

High-throughput computing, celebrating its 40th anniversary this year, was pioneered by Wisconsin computer scientist Miron Livny. It's a novel form of distributed computing that automates computing tasks across a network of thousands of computers, essentially turning a single massive computing challenge into a supercharged fleet of smaller ones. This computing innovation is helping fuel big-data discovery across hundreds of scientific projects worldwide, including the search for cosmic neutrinos, subatomic particles and gravitational waves as well as to unravel antibiotic resistance.

In 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration released the first image of a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. In 2022, they presented the image of the black hole at the center of our Milky Way, Sagittarius A*. However, the data behind the images still contained a wealth of hard-to-crack information. An international team of researchers trained a neural network to extract as much information as possible from the data.

From a handful to millions

Previous studies by the EHT Collaboration used only a handful of realistic synthetic data files. Funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) as part of the Partnership to Advance Throughput Computing (PATh) project, the Madison-based CHTC enabled the astronomers to feed millions of such data files into a so-called Bayesian neural network, which can quantify uncertainties. This allowed the researchers to make a much better comparison between the EHT data and the models.

Thanks to the neural network, the researchers now suspect that the black hole at the center of the Milky Way is spinning at almost top speed. Its rotation axis points to the Earth. In addition, the emission near the black hole is mainly caused by extremely hot electrons in the surrounding accretion disk and not by a so-called jet. Also, the magnetic fields in the accretion disk appear to behave differently from the usual theories of such disks.

""That we are defying the prevailing theory is of course exciting,"" says lead researcher Michael Janssen, of Radboud University Nijmegen, the Netherlands. ""However, I see our AI and machine learning approach primarily as a first step. Next, we will improve and extend the associated models and simulations.""

Impressive scaling

""The ability to scale up to the millions of synthetic data files required to train the model is an impressive achievement,"" adds Chi-kwan Chan, an Associate Astronomer of Steward Observatory at the University of Arizonaand a longtime PATh collaborator. ""It requires dependable workflow automation, and effective workload distribution across storage resources and processing capacity.""

""We are pleased to see EHT leveraging our throughput computing capabilities to bring the power of AI to their science,"" says Professor Anthony Gitter, a Morgridge Investigator and a PATh Co-PI. ""Like in the case of other science domains, CHTC's capabilities allowed EHT researchers to assemble the quantity and quality of AI-ready data needed to train effective models that facilitate scientific discovery.""

The NSF-funded Open Science Pool, operated by PATh, offers computing capacity contributed by more than 80 institutions across the United States. The Event Horizon black hole project performed more than 12 million computing jobs in the past three years.

""A workload that consists of millions of simulations is a perfect match for our throughput-oriented capabilities that were developed and refined over four decades"" says Livny, director of the CHTC and lead investigator of PATh. ""We love to collaborate with researchers who have workloads that challenge the scalability of our services.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Fruit-eating mastodons? Ancient fossils confirm a long-lost ecological alliance","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250614121947.htm","Sun, 15 Jun 2025 14:35:52 GMT","

Ten thousand years ago, mastodons vanished from South America. With them, an ecologically vital function also disappeared: the dispersal of seeds from large-fruited plants. A new study led by the University of O'Higgins, Chile, with key contributions from IPHES-CERCA, demonstrates for the first time -- based on direct fossil evidence -- that these extinct elephant relatives regularly consumed fruit and were essential allies of many tree species. Their loss was not only zoological; it was also botanical, ecological, and evolutionary. Some plant species that relied on mastodons for seed dispersal are now critically endangered.

Published in Nature Ecology & Evolution, the research presents the first solid evidence of frugivory in Notiomastodon platensis, a South American Pleistocene mastodon. The findings are based on a multiproxy analysis of 96 fossil teeth collected over a span of more than 1,500 kilometers, from Los Vilos to Chiloé Island in southern Chile. Nearly half of the specimens come from the emblematic site of Lake Tagua Tagua, an ancient lake basin rich in Pleistocene fauna, located in the present-day O'Higgins Region.

The study was led by Dr. Erwin González-Guarda, researcher at the University of O'Higgins and associate at IPHES-CERCA, alongside an international team that includes IPHES-CERCA researchers Dr. Florent Rivals, a paleodiet specialist; Dr. Carlos Tornero and Dr. Iván Ramírez-Pedraza, experts in stable isotopes and paleoenvironmental reconstruction; and Alia Petermann-Pichincura. The research was carried out in collaboration with the Universitat Rovira i Virgili (URV) and the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB).

An ecological hypothesis finally proven

In 1982, biologist Daniel Janzen and paleontologist Paul Martin proposed a revolutionary idea: many tropical plants developed large, sweet, and colorful fruits to attract large animals -- such as mastodons, native horses, or giant ground sloths -- that would serve as seed dispersers. Known as the ""neotropical anachronisms hypothesis,"" this theory remained unconfirmed for over forty years. Now, the study led by González-Guarda provides direct fossil evidence that validates it. To understand the lifestyle of this mastodon, the team employed various techniques: isotopic analysis, microscopic dental wear studies, and fossil calculus analysis. ""We found starch residues and plant tissues typical of fleshy fruits, such as those of the Chilean palm (Jubaea chilensis),"" explains Florent Rivals, ICREA research professor at IPHES-CERCA and an expert in paleodiet. ""This directly confirms that these animals frequently consumed fruit and played a role in forest regeneration.""

The forgotten role of large seed dispersers

""Through stable isotope analysis, we were able to reconstruct the animals' environment and diet with great precision,"" notes Iván Ramírez-Pedraza. The data point to a forested ecosystem rich in fruit resources, where mastodons traveled long distances and dispersed seeds along the way. That ecological function remains unreplaced.

""Dental chemistry gives us a direct window into the past,"" says Carlos Tornero. ""By combining different lines of evidence, we've been able to robustly confirm their frugivory and the key role they played in these ecosystems.""

A future threatened by an incomplete past

The extinction of mastodons broke a co-evolutionary alliance that had lasted for millennia. The researchers applied a machine learning model to compare the current conservation status of megafauna-dependent plants across different South American regions. The results are alarming: in central Chile, 40% of these species are now threatened -- a rate four times higher than in tropical regions where animals such as tapirs or monkeys still act as alternative seed dispersers.

""Where that ecological relationship between plants and animals has been entirely severed, the consequences remain visible even thousands of years later,"" says study co-author Andrea P. Loayza.

Species like the gomortega (Gomortega keule), the Chilean palm, and the monkey puzzle tree (Araucaria araucana) now survive in small, fragmented populations with low genetic diversity. They are living remnants of an extinct interaction.

Paleontology as a key to conservation

Beyond its fossil discoveries, the study sends a clear message: understanding the past is essential to addressing today's ecological crises. ""Paleontology isn't just about telling old stories,"" concludes Florent Rivals. ""It helps us recognize what we've lost -- and what we still have a chance to save.""

Scientists know the stomach talks to the brain, but two new studies from Rutgers Health researchers suggest the conversation is really a tug-of-war, with one side urging another bite, the other signaling ""enough.""

Together, the papers in Nature Metabolism and Nature Communications trace the first complementary wiring diagram of hunger and satiety in ways that could refine today's blockbuster weight-loss drugs and blunt their side effects.

One study, led by Zhiping Pang of Robert Wood Johnson Medical School's Center for NeuroMetabolism, pinpointed a slender bundle of neurons that runs from the hypothalamus to the brainstem.

The cells bristle with GLP-1 receptors, the proteins mimicked by weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic. When Pang's team hit the pathway with pulses of light, well-fed mice quit eating; when they silenced the circuit or deleted the receptor, the animals packed on weight. Fasting weakened the connection until a burst of natural or synthetic GLP-1 restored it.

""The synapse is a volume knob that only turns up when energy stores are low,"" Pang said, warning that drugs that keep the signal high around the clock could disrupt the brain's normal rhythm and create some of the side effects of GLP-1 drugs such as nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea and muscle wasting.

For the other paper, Mark Rossi, who co-leads the Center for NeuroMetabolism with Pang, charted the circuit that triggers hunger. His group traced inhibitory neurons in the stria terminalis to similar cells in the lateral hypothalamus.

When researchers triggered the connection, a suddenly hungry mouse would sprint for sugar water; when they blocked it, the animals lounged even after a long fast.

Hormones modulated the effect. An injection of ghrelin, the gut's hunger messenger, revved food seeking, while leptin, the satiety signal, slammed it shut. Overfed mice gradually lost the response, but it returned after diets made them thin again.

""Pang's pathway shuts things down,"" Rossi said. ""Ours steps on the accelerator.""

Although the circuits sit in different corners of the brain, members of both teams saw the same principle: Energy state rewires synapses quickly. During a fast, the hunger circuit gains sensitivity while the satiety circuit loosens; after a meal, the relationship flips.

It is the first time researchers have watched the push-pull mechanism operate in parallel pathways, a yin-yang arrangement that may explain why diets and drugs that treat only one side of the equation often lose power over time and may help in making drugs that work even better than today's generation of GLP-1 medications.

GLP-1 mimics such as Wegovy and Zepbound can trigger double-digit weight loss but also nausea, diarrhea and, in some cases, muscle wasting. Pang's data suggest a therapy targeting only the brainstem circuit and sparing peripheral organs might curb eating without the side effects. Conversely, Rossi's work hints that restoring the body's response to the hunger-regulating hormone ghrelin could help dieters who plateau after months of calorie cutting.

Both projects relied on the modern toolkit of neural biology - optogenetics to fire axons with laser light, chemogenetics to silence them, fiber-optic photometry to watch calcium pulses and old-fashioned patch-clamp recordings to monitor single synapses. Those techniques allowed the researchers to tune individual pathways with a precision that has only recently become possible.

Follow-up work from both teams will explore more questions that could improve drug design. Pang wants to measure GLP-1 release in real time to see whether short bursts, rather than constant exposure, are enough to calm appetite. Rossi is cataloging the molecular identity of his hunger-trigger cells in hopes of finding drug targets that steer craving without crushing the joy of eating.

""You want to keep the system's flexibility,"" Rossi said. ""It's the difference between dimming the lights and flicking them off.""

Allowing the brain to correctly rebalance the desire to eat or stop eating throughout the day, rather than using drugs to keep desire constantly low, may be an important ingredient in tomorrow's weight-loss prescriptions.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Galactic mystery: Why massive stars struggle to form in the Milky Way's center","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250615023033.htm","Sun, 15 Jun 2025 08:42:57 GMT","

New research led by Dr. James De Buizer at the SETI Institute and Dr. Wanggi Lim at IPAC at Caltech revealed surprising results about the rate at which high-mass stars form in the Galactic Center of the Milky Way. The researchers based their study primarily on observations from NASA's now-retired SOFIA airborne observatory, focusing on three star-forming regions -- Sgr B1, Sgr B2, and Sgr C -- located at the heart of the Galaxy. Although the central part of our Galaxy has a much higher density of star-forming material than the rest of the Milky Way, in the Galactic Center, the current rate of formation of massive stars (those larger than 8 times the mass of our Sun) appears to be lower compared to the rest of the Galaxy.

The team compared these three Galactic Center star-forming regions to similar-sized regions further out in the Galaxy, including those closer to our Sun, and confirmed that the rate of star formation is below average near the Galactic Center. Their study finds that despite the Galactic Center's dense clouds of gas and dust, conditions that typically produce stars with high masses, these star-forming regions struggle to form high-mass stars. Furthermore, the studied areas appear to lack sufficient material for continued star formation, suggesting such regions effectively produce just one generation of stars, unlike typical star-forming regions.

""Recent studies have concluded that star formation is likely depressed near the Galactic Center, and even that there may be no present star formation occurring there,"" said De Buizer, lead author of the study. ""Since presently-forming massive stars are brightest at long infrared wavelengths, we obtained the highest resolution infrared images of our Galaxy's central-most star-forming regions. The data show that, contrarily, massive stars are presently forming there, but confirm at a relatively low rate.""

The study suggests that the reason for the slowdown in star formation is due to the extreme conditions in the Galactic Center. These regions orbit swiftly around the black hole at the center of the Galaxy, interacting with older stars and possibly with other material falling toward the black hole. These conditions could inhibit gas clouds from holding together long enough to form stars in the first place and prevent those that do form stars from staying together long enough for continued future star formation.

However, Sgr B2 appears to be the exception. Although its rate of present massive star formation is unusually low, like the other Galactic Center regions studied, it seems to have maintained its reservoir of dense gas and dust, allowing for a future emergent star cluster to be born.

Traditionally, astronomers have viewed giant H II regions -- large clouds of gas, mainly hydrogen, in space like Sgr B1 and Sgr C -- as hosts of massive star clusters still embedded in their birth clouds. This study challenges that assumption. The team argues these two regions may not fit the classical definition at all, or they may represent a new, previously unrecognized category of stellar nursery.

Enshrouded in gas and dust that obscure these star-forming regions from view in all but the longest infrared wavelengths, SOFIA's high-resolution infrared eyes allowed the team to identify more than six dozen presently-forming massive stars within the Galactic Center regions. However, these regions formed fewer stars -- and topped out at a lower stellar mass -- than the Galactic average.

""These Galactic Center star-forming regions are in many ways very similar to the massive star-forming regions in the relatively calm backwaters of our galaxy,"" said Lim. ""However, the most massive stars we are finding in these Galactic Center regions, though still remarkably large, fall short in both size and quantity compared to those found in similar regions elsewhere in our Galaxy. Furthermore, such star-forming regions typically hang on to large reservoirs of star-forming material and continue to produce multiple epochs of stars, but that appears to not be the case for these Galactic Center regions.""

Lim will present the results of this study at the 246th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Anchorage, AK.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Space-laser AI maps forest carbon in minutes—a game-changer for climate science","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250614034237.htm","Sun, 15 Jun 2025 02:52:13 GMT","

Satellite data used by archaeologists to find traces of ancient ruins hidden under dense forest canopies can also be used to improve the speed and accuracy to measure how much carbon is retained and released in forests.

Understanding this carbon cycle is key to climate change research, according to Hamdi Zurqani, an assistant professor of geospatial science for the Arkansas Forest Resources Center and the College of Forestry, Agriculture and Natural Resources at the University of Arkansas at Monticello. The center is headquartered at UAM and conducts research and extension activities through the Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station and the Cooperative Extension Service, the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture's research and outreach arms.

""Forests are often called the lungs of our planet, and for good reason,"" Zurqani said. ""They store roughly 80 percent of the world's terrestrial carbon and play a critical role in regulating Earth's climate.""

To measure a forest's carbon cycle, a calculation of forest aboveground biomass is needed. Though effective, traditional ground-based methods for estimating forest aboveground biomass are labor-intensive, time-consuming and limited in spatial coverage abilities, Zurqani said.

In a study recently published in Ecological Informatics, Zurqani shows how information from open-access satellites can be integrated on Google Earth Engine with artificial intelligence algorithms to quickly and accurately map large-scale forest aboveground biomass, even in remote areas where accessibility is often an issue.

Zurqani's novel approach uses data from NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation LiDAR, also known as GEDI LiDAR, which includes three lasers installed on the International Space Station. The system can precisely measure three-dimensional forest canopy height, canopy vertical structure and surface elevation. LiDAR stands for ""light detection and ranging"" and uses light pulses to measure distance and create 3D models.

Zurqani also used imagery data from the European Space Agency's collection of Earth observation Copernicus Sentinel satellites -- Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. Combining the 3D imagery from GEDI and the optical imagery from the Sentinels, Zurqani improved the accuracy of biomass estimations.

The study tested four machine learning algorithms to analyze the data: Gradient tree boosting, random forest, classification and regression trees, or CART, and support vector machine. Gradient tree boosting achieved the highest accuracy score and the lowest error rates. Random forest came in second, proving reliable but slightly less precise. CART provided reasonable estimates but tended to focus on a smaller subset. The support vector machine algorithm struggled, Zurqani said, highlighting that not all AI models are equally suited for estimating aboveground forest biomass in this study.

The most accurate predictions, Zurqani said, came from combining Sentinel-2 optical data, vegetation indices, topographic features, and canopy height with the GEDI LiDAR dataset serving as the reference input for both training and testing the machine learning models, showing that multi-source data integration is critical for reliable biomass mapping.

Why it matters

Zurqani said that accurate forest biomass mapping has real-world implications for better accounting of carbon and improved forest management on a global scale. With more accurate assessments, governments and organizations can more precisely track carbon sequestration and emissions from deforestation to inform policy decisions.

The road ahead

While the study marks a leap forward in measuring aboveground forest biomass, Zurqani said the challenges remaining include the impact weather can have on satellite data. Some regions still lack high-resolution LiDAR coverage. He added that future research may explore deeper AI models, such as neural networks, to refine predictions further.

""One thing is clear,"" Zurqani said. ""As climate change intensifies, technology like this will be indispensable in safeguarding our forests and the planet.""

When legendary game designer Hideo Kojima announced to the world that Death Stranding 2 would soon be released, he made it known that Covid-19 had completely changed his idea for this sequel.

“We released Death Stranding before the Covid-19 pandemic, when the world was moving toward isolation and division—as with Brexit. The idea behind it was ‘Let's connect. We'll face disaster if we don't connect.' The theme, the story, and the gameplay of the first chapter all revolved around that idea,” Kojima tells WIRED. “After the release, just three months later, a pandemic broke out, and I was very surprised. It really felt like Death Stranding, in a way.”

WIRED headed to Tokyo in April for a long and comprehensive preview of the game and asked Kojima about all the secrets behind Death Stranding 2's creation. The game is set to be released June 26 and will be available on PlayStation.

“In the real world, in the 21st century, we have something similar to the Chiral Network—the internet. It was different than, for example, the Spanish flu pandemic a century earlier. We survived the pandemic because of the internet and the fact that people were about to connect online. Now there are people who work for our studio from home and whose faces I don't even know. Live concerts were canceled, and everything moved to online streaming. I understand that it was inevitable during the pandemic. It was the same with school. Instead of playing with friends or learning from teachers, you watched a screen, as if you were watching a YouTube video.

“Everything was converging toward the metaverse. You'd turn on the TV and everyone was talking about how we were now in the metaverse era, where there was no need to physically interact with people. I thought we were going in the wrong direction. Communication between human beings shouldn't be like that. You meet people by chance and see unexpected things. With the path we were on, all of that would be lost.”

As Kojima explains, the initial concept for Death Stranding 2 was very different, and even his idea of connections between people changed after the pandemic: “I already had an idea for Death Stranding 2 before the pandemic,” he says, “but after going through that experience I felt something wasn't right, and I rewrote it.”

“The strangest thing was that after creating a game with the theme ‘let's connect instead of isolating,' the pandemic came along, and I started thinking, ‘Maybe connecting so much is not such a good thing.' So we went back to the stick-and-rope theory [from Death Stranding] again. There is a lot of anticipation of that theme in the game, and I'm sure many people will understand what I meant by coming to the end of the experience. For example, there's a character who will express the same feelings that I felt during the pandemic.”

“In the logo of the first Death Stranding, the strands started from the bottom, and the general theme was ‘let's connect.' In Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, however, the strands in the logo come down from the top and are somewhat reminiscent of [the puppeteer's strings from] the Godfather logo. Even within the game, you will see threads that start from many people and go upward, like Dollman and the robotic soldiers. These are all clues. When you really start to think about what it means to connect, you start to ask questions. But that's all I'll say for now. Play the game when it comes out in June to learn more!”

“I know everyone experienced the pandemic, so I think certain feelings will seem familiar to many, although I can't be totally sure. I'm not saying the metaverse is evil, but you have come all this way and played the game for four days. Today, something like that would normally only happen online.”

“This game, however, is about connections. You'll understand it better as you progress through Death Stranding 2; I think you'll start to feel it after a while. That's why we invited you to come here physically, despite your busy schedules. People from all over the world have gathered here in our studios, meeting each other and starting conversations. You have seen the view from Tokyo Station, or maybe you've wandered into a random restaurant. These things are part of the human experience. These coincidences and unintended events tie together naturally, but none of this exists in the metaverse.”

Elle Fanning's character in Death Stranding 2

In Death Stranding 2: On the Beach the gameplay is much more action-oriented. The player can choose to fight much more often than in the first part, although it's not required. If the first chapter often tried to avoid firefights, almost punishing those who killed enemies, something has also changed in terms of this when it comes to the sequel, Kojima says.

“I've talked about the ‘we shouldn't have connected' theme before, and I've also told you about the stick-and-rope theory in Death Stranding in the past. Today, even though the world is connected via a rope, which we know as the online world, people still play games where they use the ‘stick,' shooting each other. That's why I wanted to create a game where you use a rope above all else, and that was Death Stranding.

“There are so many conflicts in the world today. In the end, connecting with the rope isn't the solution to everything. Higgs [Monaghan] will tell you something similar in the game: to connect, you also need a stick. The further you go into the game, the better you will understand what Higgs means. That's one of the reasons I said ‘we shouldn't have connected,' and it's not just about the game aspect, it's also a reflection on a social level.”

Among the many important themes in the game are those related to loss and mourning, and Kojima reveals that the inspiration to include them also partly stems from personal experiences: “It comes from within, so I'd say it's half based on real experiences I've had and half from fiction. It comes from a very intimate place, from thoughts like a sense of loneliness, the mystery of where the dead go, and the pain of not having had a true goodbye with someone we have lost.”

Transportation in Death Stranding 2

The new Death Stranding expands and improves on every element of the game's first installment. Kojima says the transition from PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 5 means most changes focused on game design and story.

“I hope you remember the first Metal Gear Solid, where you really had to concentrate on infiltration, otherwise it was ‘game over.' At the beginning of the game, before you got to the lift, you had no weapons, but once you got past that part, you could get access to some. The reason I had done this was that if I had put a weapon there from the beginning, players would have used it to eliminate enemies. It would no longer have been a ‘stealth' game. That's why I deliberately removed it, but many hated that choice and many couldn't even get to the lift.

“In the first Metal Gear Solid we included a lot of mechanics to teach what stealth was. So for MGS 2, I knew that people now understood the concept better, and so I made the weapons more accessible. You could even target specific body parts of enemies.”

Fighting in Death Stranding 2

In fact, all of Metal Gear can be considered an increasingly exponential and often experimental evolution (such as the open world of the fifth chapter) of the formula born with the saga's historic progenitor. The Death Stranding saga seems to be following a similar evolution: “For Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, I used the same approach. At the beginning it was a game focused on deliveries, something no one had ever seen before, so some people might feel frustrated by that.

“But now the public is familiar with the idea, so I wanted to give players more freedom, even those who want to fight, for example. Now you can use weapons—you can, but it's not compulsory. You can use vehicles and motorbikes. Everything is more accessible in this second installment. It's still a delivery game, but I wanted to offer more freedom in terms of game mechanics—that was the goal.”

This freedom is also reflected in the combat. Indeed, the game is now much more focused on firefights, but the main thing was, above all else, the ability to give players a choice in how they approach the various missions—something that doesn't force them to fight at all costs: “Well, I don't want to suggest to people that they focus on combat or anything like that, but there are a lot of players all over the world asking me to make another Metal Gear, so here too I added more options for combat.”

“This, however, is still a game focused primarily on deliveries. You can avoid enemies by taking a longer ride around the map or by quickly passing a vehicle or motorbike through an encampment, or you can fight them. I wanted the choice to be up to the player. In case he chooses combat, we had to change the design of the weapons to make them easier to use. When we were working on these mechanics, I was a little worried, because many of the team members who worked with me on Metal Gear still work with me, and we kept asking ourselves, ‘Does this feel too Metal Gear?' but we didn't do it deliberately.”

This freer approach was also shared by his colleagues: Yoji Shinkawa, art director of character and mechanical design, who has worked with Kojima since Metal Gear Solid; Hirohaki Yoshiike, lead level designer; Takayuki Uchida, technical art director, lead environment artist; and, finally, Akio Sakamoto, chief technology officer, technical director.

Whether in exploration, combat, or stealth, the development team's approach has always been to provide the player with the tools to act as he or she prefers, which is why over the years they have focused heavily on improving gunfights and stealth, incorporating new weapons, new mechanics and the ability to adapt Sam's character to each user's play style.

Death Stranding 2

Kojima says Mexico was a natural choice to continue the path that started with the first game, even though it wasn't his original plan: “In Death Stranding you connected the North American continent from east to west, mirroring the exploration of the American frontier. America already had the [United Cities of America], so for the sequel I wondered whether or not to use a similar setting. In the first idea I had, the player would have had to disconnect everything he had previously connected, because he would discover that these connections had been a big mistake. But I was not convinced, especially since I would have reused the exact same setting.”

The choice to use Australia as Plate Gate in the second chapter was because of its geographical features: a place that was not too large and which ran from east to west along an ocean was needed. This portal connecting the continents provides some interesting possibilities for sequels: “The concept of the Plate Gate would allow me to create infinite sequels! I obviously have no plans to do that, but I do have an idea in mind for one possible one. I don't think I will make it, but if I passed the project on to someone else, they probably could.”

Kojima says he decided to introduce a day/night cycle to give players the freedom to choose their favorite time of day to play, as it will be possible to change the time simply by sleeping in Sam's room. This choice, however, has led to some minor problems in the direction of the cutscenes, which are also managed in real time according to the time of day.

He mentions how important it is for him to analyze player behavior in his games, particularly with regard to the asynchronous multiplayer of the first Death Stranding, which allows players to share objects and constructions, such as bridges and ladders, with other users. Kojima is surprised by the success that the highways have had, and especially the fact that even today, five years after the launch of the first chapter, there are still people who continue to build and maintain them. He says he's not much of a construction guy, preferring to use simpler tools like ladders when playing.

Combat vehicles in Death Stranding 2

For players who are fans of this mechanic, however, he has added many elements in Death Stranding 2, such as the monorail, which is a new addition. He went on to explain the meaning of likes, which work very much like social media likes in the game: “A like is not a currency—you don't get any items or become stronger because of them. The team was very hesitant about adding them at first. They are closer to likes in the real world. They have no concrete value, but they make you feel good. From a game design point of view, it's strange. Normally you accumulate points and get a rank or rewards, but in our case the like is just a personal incentive. It's exactly like on social. I wanted to create something like that, and in the end, people seemed to enjoy it. I expected more criticism. Even the team, who were initially opposed, changed their minds.”

The first and now also the second Death Stranding unite the worlds of film and video games thanks to the presence of many famous actors. Kojima has said the criteria he uses to choose them is always based on the connections he has with people and their work.

Kojima says he usually contacts these stars personally and, on many occasions, including with Luca Marinelli, who plays Neil in the game, the actor or their agent turns out to be a fan of the game designer. “That is generally my selection process. I also audition, of course, but it's mostly a matter of connections. This also applies to Od, Physint, and other projects.”

Luca Marinelli's character in Death Stranding 2

“I have already mentioned on several occasions that I saw the Italian film Martin Eden, with Luca Marinelli. It had a big impact on me. I may have seen it before the pandemic, but I wrote a commentary for the promotion of the film in Japan. After that, Luca sent me an email. He told me that he has been a fan of mine since his childhood and that he had read my comments. He asked the distributor for my contact details, and we got to know each other.”

“When I thought about involving him, I knew that his character had to surpass the one played by Mads Mikkelsen. I asked myself: ‘Is that possible?' Mads' character could not return in Death Stranding 2, and I knew some fans would be disappointed. I had to find someone who could go further. I remembered Luca, wrote to him directly, and offered him the role. He accepted immediately.”

Shooting for a video game, however, is not as simple as shooting a film, as Kojima tells us: “It's a job that requires a lot of strength, both physical and mental. Before shooting we have to scan the actor, decide on a hairstyle, makeup, and costumes and then create the digital data. And in order to record the scenes we have to coordinate everyone's schedules.

“Unlike a film, however, we can't shoot everything in three or four months, and we meet periodically during the development. It's a tiring process, both for us and for the actors. It's not a matter of three months and we're done. After that there is also the ADR [automatic dialog replacement, or dubbing], for example. Marinelli doesn't just appear in cutscenes. When the character appears as an NPC, you also have to record sounds, moans, breaths, grunts … and that part never seems to end. It's tough. And, of course, the actors are also working on other projects at the same time.

Death Stranding 2 also features Marinelli's wife, Alissa Jung: “I was also looking for someone to play Lucy, but in the midst of the pandemic it wasn't easy. One day, Luca asked me if I had found his ‘counterpart.' I told him no. He told me that his wife is an actor and also a director, so we met and I found her really brilliant, intelligent, perfect for the role of Lucy. We scanned them both at the height of the pandemic. Neil also has scenes with Norman, while Alissa, who plays Lucy, has mostly scenes with Luke. I can't say more, or I'll reveal some spoilers.”

The worlds in Death Stranding 2

Among Kojima's favorite scenes filmed for Death Stranding 2, he mentions one shot by Marinelli and Jung: “Luca, meanwhile, was filming the series Mussolini: Son of the Century, directed by Joe Wright. When I offered him the role he was beautiful, he looked like a young Alain Delon. But when I scanned him he had changed: I asked him what had happened. He replied: ‘I'm getting fat to play Mussolini.' We couldn't do much, so we scanned him as he was.

“A year later, at the time of motion capture, he had changed again. I thought: ‘Oh God, it's not the Luke I expected,' but we then solved it digitally. It was quite a problem, but what he shot is really good! Most of the scenes with Alissa and Luca are just between the two of them, and the interesting thing is that, because they are husband and wife in real life, they have an incredible chemistry.

“Luca comes from the theater, and Alissa is a director as well as an actor. Sometimes she tried to take over on the set too! We shot at the SIE studio in Los Angeles. It's a huge studio, almost like a big Hollywood set. Me and a couple of my staff went to manage the shoot, but there were many other people including technicians, makeup artists, and others. When Luca started acting, however, everyone came over to watch. This had never happened to me before.”

Kojima's games also impress with their beautiful soundtracks, and Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is no exception. One of the star artists of the new title is Woodkid, and the game director recounted that he met him by chance in Paris in 2020, when the artist wanted to introduce himself, being a fan of Kojima's, by playing one of his songs. Kojima was also struck by Woodkid's music videos, which have atmospheres like that of Death Stranding, and Kojima decided to contact him to have him work on some songs for the soundtrack of the second chapter.

The music was an important legacy to continue, especially after the passing of Ryan Karazija of Low Roar, whose musical style had profoundly marked the first chapter. Kojima explained that he had also included some unreleased Low Roar tracks in the new game, sent to him by the singer's family.

Kojima follows the same approach for the music in his games as he does for the choice of actors: “Just like for the casting of actors, I contact them directly: Sometimes I ask if I can use one of their songs, other times they offer to write a new one, and an exchange takes place.”

Many other artists contributed to the new game, such as Caroline Polachek, the Mongolian singer-songwriter Magnolian, and the Polish pianist Hania Rani. Each musical choice, the game designer explains, reflects his personal taste: a mix of different sensibilities that further enriches the atmosphere of the game.

At the end of our interview, Kojima talks about what was the most rewarding aspect of creating Death Stranding 2: On the Beach: “That's a difficult question. I wrote the concept for this game completely on my own, during the pandemic.

“Yoji [Shinkawa] would come by maybe once a week, but otherwise I worked without seeing anyone in person. It was a really tough time. Some people still worked from home. Yet, despite all the challenges, we're almost done now.

“During the pandemic I thought we would never make it. I think all the studios felt the same. We couldn't shoot anything, everything was at a standstill, and I wondered: ‘How can I make a game like this?' But, thanks to the support of so many people, we are now really close to the end. I think we started performance capture in 2021. At that time I couldn't go to Los Angeles to direct; the studio wouldn't allow it. It was like that for all the studios. So we had to do everything remotely. I was working from Tokyo and connected online with Los Angeles.

Sam and Lou in Death Stranding 2

“The actors obviously had to go to the studio, but I had to explain everything from a distance: ‘Stand here, walk there, do this...' It was very difficult. We used iPads and smartphones, but it didn't work very well. At one point I thought I was going crazy.

“Then an acquaintance of mine at Sony created something called Mado, which means window in Japanese. It's like a giant smartphone, a two-way monitor that almost looks like a door. If you stand in front of it, you can see inside the studio in Los Angeles. You see and hear everything in real time. Unfortunately you can't walk through to the other side but they lent us two of these devices and we managed to get the footage we needed. Even Norman got close to that ‘window.' It was difficult, but there was also something beautiful about the process.

“When you work in person, you can talk directly and change things on the spot. But remotely, you'll have a meeting every week or every month, and everything slows down. Sometimes you find out too late that someone was working on an idea that had already been rejected. I think all studios faced similar problems. So what was the most rewarding part? Simply the fact that we managed to go all the way and finish this game.”

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

Scott Bolton's first encounter with Io took place in the summer of 1980, right after he graduated from college and started a job at NASA. The Voyager 1 spacecraft had flown past this moon of Jupiter, catching the first glimpse of active volcanism on a world other than Earth. Umbrella-shaped outbursts of magmatic matter rocketed into space from all over Io's surface. “They looked amazingly beautiful,” said Bolton, who is now based at the Southwest Research Institute in Texas. “It was like an artist drew it. I was amazed at how exotic it looked compared to our moon.”

Scientists like Bolton have been trying to understand Io's exuberant volcanism ever since. A leading theory has been that just below the moon's crust hides a global magma ocean, a vast contiguous cache of liquid rock. This theory dovetails neatly with several observations, including ones showing a roughly uniform distribution of Io's volcanoes, which seem to be tapping the same omnipresent, hellish source of melt.

But now, it appears that Io's hell has vanished—or rather, it was never there to begin with. During recent flybys of the volcanic moon by NASA's Juno spacecraft, scientists measured Io's gravitational effect on Juno, using the spacecraft's tiniest wobbles to determine the moon's mass distribution and therefore its internal structure. The scientists reported in Nature that nothing significant is sloshing about just beneath Io's crust.

“There is no shallow ocean,” said Bolton, who leads the Juno mission.

Independent scientists can find no fault with the study. “The results and the work are totally solid and pretty convincing,” said Katherine de Kleer, a planetary scientist at the California Institute of Technology.

The data has reopened a mystery that spills over into other rocky worlds. Io's volcanism is powered by a gravity-driven mechanism called tidal heating, which melts the rock into magma that erupts from the surface. Whereas Io is the poster child for this mechanism, tidal heating also heats many other worlds, including Io's neighbor, the icy moon Europa, where the heat is thought to sustain a subterranean saltwater ocean. NASA launched the $5 billion Clipper spacecraft to search Europa's sky for signs of life in the proposed underground ocean.

A map of Io's surface, created with images from the Voyager 1 and Galileo missions, shows the wide distribution of the moon's volcanoes. The large red ring is sulfurous fallout from the plume of the Pele volcano.

But if Io doesn't have a magma ocean, what might that mean for Europa? And, scientists now wonder, how does tidal heating even work?

Heat drives geology, the rocky foundation upon which everything else, from volcanic activity and atmospheric chemistry to biology, is built. Heat often comes from a planet's formation and the decay of its radioactive elements. But smaller celestial objects like moons have only tiny reserves of such elements and of residual heat, and when those reserves run dry, their geological activity flatlines.

Or, at least, it should—but something appears to grant geologic life to small orbs throughout the solar system long after they should have geologically perished.

Io is the most flamboyant member of this puzzling club—a burnt-orange, crimson, and tawny Jackson Pollock painting. The discovery of its over-spilling cauldrons of lava is one of the most famous tales in planetary science, as they were predicted to exist before they were discovered.

NASA's Voyager 1 probe photographed Io in 1979, revealing the first glimpse of volcanism beyond Earth. In this photo mosaic, a lava plume is seen emanating from Loki Patera, now known to be the moon's largest volcano.

On March 2, 1979, a paper in Science ruminated on Io's strange orbit. Because of the positions and orbits of neighboring moons, Io's orbit is elliptical rather than circular. And when Io is closer to Jupiter, it experiences a stronger gravitational pull from the gas giant than when it is farther away. The study authors figured that Jupiter's gravity must therefore be constantly kneading Io, pulling its surface up and down by up to 100 meters, and, per their calculations, generating a lot of frictional heat within it—a mechanism they described as “tidal heating.” They conjectured that Io may be the most intensely heated rocky body in the solar system. “One might speculate that widespread and recurrent surface volcanism would occur,” they wrote.

Just three days later, Voyager 1 flew by. An image taken on March 8 documented two gigantic plumes arching above its surface. After ruling out all other causes, NASA scientists concluded that Voyager had seen an alien world's volcanic eruptions. They reported their discovery in Science that June, just three months after the prediction.

The planetary science community quickly coalesced around the idea that tidal heating within Io is responsible for the never-ending volcanism on the surface. “The unknown part that's been an open question of decades is what that means for the interior structure,” said Mike Sori, a planetary geophysicist at Purdue University. Where is that tidal heating focused within Io, and just how much heat and melting is it generating?

NASA's Galileo spacecraft studied Jupiter and several of its moons around the turn of the millennium. One of its instruments was a magnetometer, and it picked up a peculiar magnetic field emanating from Io. The signal appeared to be coming from an electrically conductive fluid—a lot of fluid, in fact.

After years of study, scientists concluded in 2011 that Galileo had detected a global magma ocean just below Io's crust. Whereas Earth's mantle is mostly solid and plasticky, Io's subsurface was thought to be filled with an ocean of liquid rock 50 kilometers thick, or almost five times thicker than the Pacific Ocean at its deepest point.

A similar magnetic field was coming from Europa, too—in this case, apparently generated by a vast ocean of salty water. The implications were profound: With a lot of rocky material, tidal heating can make oceans of magma. With plenty of ice, it can create oceans of potentially habitable liquid water.

By the time the Juno spacecraft started swinging around Jupiter in 2016, the belief that Io had a magma ocean was widespread. But Bolton and his colleagues wanted to double-check.

A sequence of images taken over the course of eight minutes by NASA's New Horizons probe in 2007 shows an eruption by the Tvashtar Paterae volcanic region. The plume in this false-color image rises 330 kilometers from the moon's surface.

During flybys in December 2023 and February 2024, Juno came within 1,500 kilometers of Io's scorched surface. Although the remarkable images of active volcanoes drew everyone's attention, the goal of these flybys was to find out if a magma ocean truly lay beneath the moon's rocky skin.

To investigate, the team used an unlikely tool: Juno's radio transponder, which communicates with Earth, sending and receiving signals. Because of Io's unevenly distributed mass, its gravitational field isn't perfectly symmetrical. That uneven gravitational field subtly alters the motion of Juno as it flies by, causing it to accelerate or decelerate a little.

That means Juno's radio transmissions will experience the Doppler effect, where the wavelength shifts slightly in response to Io's uneven gravitational field. By looking at the incredibly small shifts in the transmissions, Bolton's team was able to create a high-fidelity picture of Io's gravitational field and use that to determine its internal structure. “If there were indeed a global magma ocean, you'd see a lot more distortion as Io orbited around Jupiter and as the tidal forces flexed it and changed its shape,” said Ashley Davies, a volcanologist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory who wasn't involved with the new study.

But Bolton's team did not find this level of distortion. Their conclusion was clear. “There cannot be a shallow magma ocean fueling the volcanoes,” said study coauthor Ryan Park, a Juno co-investigator at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The Cassini-Huygens mission photographed Io against the backdrop of Jupiter in 2001.

So what else might be powering Io's volcanoes?

On Earth, discrete reservoirs of magma of different types—from the tarlike viscous matter that powers explosive eruptions to the runnier, honey-esque stuff that gushes out of some volcanoes—are located within the crust at various depths, all created by the interactions of tectonic plates, the moving jigsaw pieces that make up Earth's surface. Io lacks plate tectonics and (perhaps) a diversity of magma types, but its crust may nevertheless be peppered with magma reservoirs. This was one of the original lines of thought until Galileo's data convinced many of the magma ocean theory.

The new study doesn't rule out a far deeper magma ocean. But that abyssal cache would have to be filled with magma so iron-rich and dense (because of its great depth) that it would struggle to migrate to the surface and power Io's volcanism. “And at some depth, it becomes tricky to distinguish between what we would call a deep magma ocean versus a liquid core,” Park said.

For some, this raises an irreconcilable problem. Galileo's magnetometer detected signs of a shallow magma ocean, but Juno gravity data has emphatically ruled that out. “People are not really disputing the magnetometer results, so you have to make that fit with everything else,” said Jani Radebaugh, a planetary geologist at Brigham Young University.

Researchers disagree on the best interpretation of the Galileo data. The magnetic signals “were taken as probably the best evidence for a magma ocean, but really they weren't that strong,” said Francis Nimmo, a planetary scientist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a coauthor of the new study.  The induction data couldn't distinguish between a partly molten (but still solid) interior and a fully molten magma ocean, he said.

Perhaps the main reason scientists study Io is because it teaches us about the fundamentals of tidal heating. Io's tidal heating engine remains impressive—there's clearly a lot of volcano-feeding magma being generated. But if it's not producing a subsurface magma ocean, does that mean tidal heating doesn't generate water oceans, either?

Scientists remain confident that it does. Nobody doubts that Saturn's moon Enceladus, which is also tidally heated, contains an underground saltwater ocean; the Cassini spacecraft not only detected signs of its existence but directly sampled some of it erupting out of the moon's South Pole. And although there is some light skepticism about whether Europa has an ocean, most scientists think it does.

The smooth, lightly scratched surface of Jupiter's icy moon Europa, photographed by the Juno spacecraft in 2022, shows no sign of what lies beneath: in all likelihood, a vast saltwater ocean.

Crucially, unlike Io's odd magnetic field, which seemed to indicate that it concealed an ocean's worth of fluid, Europa's own Galileo-era magnetic signal remains robust. “It's a pretty clean result at Europa,” said Robert Pappalardo, the Europa mission's project scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The icy moon is far enough from Jupiter and the intense plasma-flooded space environment of Io that Europa's own magnetic induction signal “really sticks out.”

But if both moons are tidally heated, why does only Europa have an inner ocean? According to Nimmo, “there's a fundamental difference between a liquid-water ocean and a magma ocean. The magma wants to escape; the water really doesn't.” Liquid rock is less dense than solid rock, so it wants to rise and erupt quickly; the new study suggests that it doesn't linger at depth long enough inside Io to form a massive, interconnected ocean. But liquid water is, unusually, denser than its solid icy form. “Liquid water is heavy, so it collects into an ocean,” Sori said.

“I think that's the big-picture message from this paper,” Sori added. Tidal heating might struggle to create magma oceans. But on icy moons, it can easily make watery oceans due to the bizarrely low density of ice. And that suggests life has a multitude of potentially habitable environments throughout the solar system to call home.

The revelation that Io is missing its shallow magma ocean underscores just how little is known about tidal heating. “We've never really understood where in Io's interior the mantle is melting, how that mantle melt is getting to the surface,” de Kleer said.

Our own moon shows evidence of primeval tidal heating too. Its oldest crystals formed 4.51 billion years ago from the stream of molten matter that got blasted off Earth by a giant impact event. But a lot of lunar crystals seem to have formed from a second reservoir of molten rock 4.35 billion years ago. Where did that later magma come from?

Nimmo and coauthors offered one idea in a paper published in Nature in December: Maybe Earth's moon was like Io. The moon was significantly closer to Earth back then, and the gravitational fields from the Earth and the sun were battling for control. At a certain threshold, when the gravitational influence of both were roughly equal, the moon might have temporarily adopted an elliptical orbit and gotten tidally heated by Earth's gravitational kneading. Its interior might have remelted, causing a surprise secondary flourish of volcanism.

But exactly where within the moon's interior its tidal heating was concentrated—and thus, where all that melting was happening—isn't clear.

Perhaps if Io can be understood, so too can our moon—as well as several of the other satellites in our solar system with hidden tidal engines. For now, this volcanic orb remains maddeningly inscrutable. “Io's a complicated beast,” Davies said. “The more we observe it, the more sophisticated the data and the analyses, the more puzzling it becomes.”

Kind of like Lord of the Rings, what is the best mattress out there to rule them all? Typically, as a professional mattress tester of over five years, I'd tell you it differs from person to person. But there are always the rare few models that manage to pull off the near impossible for a mattress to accomplish: being a supportive and comfortable fit for anybody, regardless of build or sleeping position. The Nolah Evolution Hybrid is one of those mattresses, and one of the rare few near-perfect beds I've tested to date. Here's why.

A commonality among Nolah mattresses is the use of something called AirFoam, which Nolah created to improve on memory foam performance factors: pressure relief, support, and durability. AirFoam is also meant to sleep cooler, since sucking in body heat is a known problem with memory foam. Can I prove that these things are actually at play when I sleep on a mattress? Scientifically, no—I can't necessarily break out the beakers in the bedroom. But what I can tell you is that the model I regularly use, the luxury firm, does a swell job with pressure relief and lumbar support.

This mattress's full government name used to be the “Nolah Evolution 15,” with the number denoting the full height of the mattress. It's definitely a taller mattress, and I use a frame lower to the ground to accommodate that (and my dogs' smaller legs). The newer iterations of the Nolah Evolution have the upgrade option of throwing on a Glacio-Tex-covered pillow top, which from other Nolah models I can tell you is very much cool to the touch. The standard pillow top's organic cotton cover (which I have the most experience with) is breathable, but it isn't going to give you that refrigerator-opening-blast-in-the-face coolness. The pillow top is your first pass at getting pressure relief from the mattress, and it lets the heavier areas of your body sink in a bit so they're not chafing against the mattress. So, side sleepers, pay attention to what I'm saying here. It's our top-tested pick for y'all for a reason!

However, the pillow top isn't doing all the heavy lifting for temperature control and pressure relief. A “Heat Escape Gusset” encircles the pillow top, which is essentially just mesh that is supposed to let heat escape from within the pillow top. After the pillow top comes the “Zoned AirFoam HD” layer—a fancy way of saying that this layer is for advanced pressure relief due to both the foam structure and perforation.

These holes allow the hips and shoulders to get a generally softer feel, while a firmer one is upheld right under where your spine curves. A 2-inch layer of comfort foam follows for—you guessed it—more pressure relief, along with a transition layer protecting the foam from the coil core. The coils are pocketed, allowing each one to react to your body instead of making it a group project like traditional innerspring beds of old. They're also reinforced in the center and along the edges, which is just an extra-firm feel to keep these particular areas extra-supported. Lastly, everything is set up on a foam base, which lets the coils really do their thing without being compressed by contact with your bed frame.

OK, enough shop talk. Here's what I like from testing this mattress. I remember when Nolah first launched the Evolution back in 2020, and it was touted as a good option for side sleepers with all the pressure relief and lumbar support features. When I eventually tried it (and various iterations afterward), it consistently delivered on these marks. Something that has always stood out to me as a major value add was the three firmness options available: plush, luxury firm, and firm. Having a variety of firmnesses is an easy way to make a mattress more accessible to all kinds of sleepers, especially with different body types and sleeping positions.

I landed on “luxury firm” for a couple of reasons, chief among them being that I'm part of a dynamic sleeping duo. In other words, my husband is a back sleeper, and I'm a stomach sleeper (who is desperately trying to be a side sleeper, mind you). All to say, these sleeping positions can require different firmness levels for adequate support, preferences not even being factored in. Luxury firm is the middle ground, and we've found it to be a welcoming amount of softness that doesn't cancel out the feeling of support.

While I'm on my side, my hips and shoulders get hugged, and if I'm on my stomach, my lower back stays lifted. Everything remains relatively on the same level—hips, lower back, and shoulders—which is what you want for even spine alignment. When on your back, your spine curves away from the bed, but the pillow top takes up that space nicely. That way your back doesn't feel like it's being left out support-wise, and this eliminates a potential cause of back pain.

I do pick up on some rocking if my husband moves around in his sleep, which isn't ideal, but it's not the most disruptive I've ever tested. I'm often relegated to the very edge of the mattress while my dogs stretch out (a mother's sacrifice, I tell you). The reinforced coils are fine for supporting you while lying down, and your weight is evenly distributed across them. Sitting is a whole other ball game, especially if you're like me and sit at the foot to put on your socks.

And cooling—let's talk about that. Granted, I've only ever tested versions with the organic cotton cover, as the new and improved Glacio-Tex cover is a new development. Even with the AirFoam and heat escape gusset at play, it stays at room temperature. This is fine for my needs, but I make sure to use cooling sheets and keep the fan running. If you're a hot sleeper by nature, or have medical conditions like POTS or menopause and really need that cool-feeling mattress, you may need to go all in on the upgraded pillow top.

A small detail that I must highlight as well is that the mattress has handles. Shockingly, this is pretty rare in the online mattress space—at least in the models I've tested in my time. They're located on the sides and have been very handy (pun intended) for when I rotate my mattress every few months.

The highest compliment a mattress could get from a longtime mattress reviewer isn't just a good review. It's going so far as to get the mattress for themselves. And if you haven't picked up on it by now, I have the Nolah Evolution hybrid at home. I also recommend it to friends and family, and if you see it in our guides, know it was probably me pushing to add it as a recommendation.

Now, goodbye for now, and excuse me while I swan dive into my bed for a nap.

It's been 10 years since Alexa von Tobel sold her financial planning startup Learnvest to Northwestern Mutual for $250 million.

Since then, von Tobel became Northwestern Mutual's first chief digital officer, then chief innovation officer, before launching an early-stage venture firm of her own, Inspired Capital, with former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker. She's also a New York Times bestelling author, and she's about to launch a new interview podcast, “Inspired with Alexa von Tobel.”

In a conversation with TechCrunch, von Tobel recalled the hectic period around the acquisition, which closed literally days before the birth of her first child, and when she knew it was time to start her own firm.

Von Tobel explained that she created Inspired to be the investor she'd dreamed of — one with a “cultish commitment to entrepreneurship” — when she was a founder herself. And while Inspired is a generalist firm, she said she feels both “urgent and optimistic” about fintech, the sector where she launched her career. (One of her pre-Inspired fintech investments, Chime, just went public.)

“We think of this wave as fintech 3.0,” von Tobel said. “The next wave of innovation won't come from superficial tweaks but from fundamental deep product reinvention — tools that meet the needs of a changing economy and a more diverse, digitally native population.”

The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Congratulations on the 10-year anniversary of the acquisition. Looking back, what do you feel proudest of?

First, Northwestern Mutual is an incredible company, and our software became an incredibly important part of the customer experience. And I am so proud that so many of the LearnVest team stayed at Northwestern Mutual for so long, and it really was just a merger of actual values. It's just amazing how simple some things are, it comes down to the values of two companies and the missions of two companies.

I sold on a Wednesday and went into labor with my first child that weekend. All jokes aside, I always say it took me about a year to mentally just recover from being, like, all systems were go, my brain was being pushed to manage so many things. Literally, I was having my first child. It was like the world threw a bus at me and I caught it.

So when you were closing the deal, was there a ticking clock in your mind, that you had to finish everything before this whole other thing happens?

Of course. If you think about it, we literally signed on, I think, 11am on March 25 and then we did a press tour with the CEO, and then the next day, we did a stand up with the entire team, and then I went to sleep and literally woke up in labor.

Having your first child is priceless. There's nothing in the world that is more valuable to me than having my children, nothing. And so I kept being like, “We have to get this done, because I'm not leaving the hospital to come back and close a deal. I actually need to focus on this human being that I'm bringing into the world.” I always joke that the lawyers took me very seriously.

When people on the outside talk about an acquisition, obviously, the first thing they talk about is usually the financials, and then one of the signs of success is the product. LearnVest as a product doesn't exist anymore, but it sounds like it was less about having LearnVest as a standalone product and more about transforming Northwestern Mutual.

It was so much bigger than a product. [Northwestern Mutual's] John Schlifske, he's no longer CEO, but he is one of the people I look up to most in the world, just a formidable human being. And he kept being like, “We're gonna merge the companies.” And I would laugh — one is a $40-billion-a-year company, and [the other is] little tiny LearnVest. But he really meant it. He was like, “We're gonna use this as a catalyst.” It was a catalyst for an entire digital transformation.

I became the company's first ever chief digital officer, and then chief innovation officer, and it was really about taking everything and merging it into the broader parent company. My CTO of LearnVest became the CTO of the parent company.

You stayed for four years? 

Yeah, [my last day] was basically end of January 2019, and that day we launched Inspired.

How did you know it was time to leave, and where did the idea for Inspired come from?

I'm always at my best when I'm building something that I wish existed for me. And I've said many times that the idea for Inspired actually happened when I dropped out of business school, and I was a really all-in entrepreneur in every way — I dropped out basically December 18 of 2008, at the bottom of the worst recession in 81 years, not necessarily the the the most inviting time to start a company.

And I really was looking for a capital partner that didn't exist. I had this vision of what it should look and feel like, this sort of rigor and camaraderie and in-the-trenches-ness of what an early stage capital partner could be, and I didn't see it in the market. That was New York in 2008, 2009, and I had this long-term plan of one day, I want to come back and build that.

Fast forward to 2018, 2019 I'd started really actively dreaming about what that could look like. And one day I was like, it has to happen, it's now.

We're now almost seven years in. We're a dedicated early stage venture fund, generalist, headquartered in New York, but investing everywhere. And I feel like I've been here for one minute. It literally is the best job I've ever had.

You mentioned having this idea of a capital partner that you wished you'd had. How do you put that into practice?

What was I looking for in that capital? 

What were you looking for, and how did you get everyone at the on-board with that vision?

So, when I talk to entrepreneurs, I always say Inspired is different for four key reasons. The first reason is that we are extremely long duration capital. It means when we back a founder, we truly put blinders on for 20 years. When you're building a company, there's choices you have to make as a CEO, which is, “Do I do the thing for next month so that things look good, or do the harder thing that won't look good next month, maybe it pays off in three years, or not?” And what we always say is, “Do the harder thing, do the thing that's creating far more long-term value and worry less about synthetic results.”

The second thing is, our team's pretty unique in that we've built and scaled more than 10 businesses that have touched hundreds of millions of users around the world. That mentality is so different when you're sitting in the seat working with an entrepreneur, because we haven't necessarily lived every experience, but we've lived a lot, and we appreciate the contours. It's almost like seeing 3D versus 2D.

The third thing is that our team operates like one unit. So when we back a company, you actually get the entire team. At many firms, you get one partner, that's the person they know, they know you, and if, God forbid, that partner leaves, it's like you've evaporated your social equity that you built up with that partner. We operate like a swarm, where you get all of us and we actively do weekly stand ups on the entire portfolio, so that everybody's up to speed. 

And then the final thing, because of [Inspired co-founder Penny Pritzker], she's on the board of Microsoft, was U.S. Secretary of Commerce. So we like to say that, there are many, many, many, many ways that we can help companies get access to things that are really hard to get as just a sole founder in your 20s or 30s, where we can actually be a tremendous business accelerant to our companies in a pretty unique way, with access to tech and government and many other vectors.

So in short, that was the firm I wanted.

I wanted a deeply cultish commitment to entrepreneurship. We always talk about this Inspired future — one of the things I love so much about entrepreneurship is, no great entrepreneur shows up and is like, “Let's make the world worse,” right? They show up and they're like, “Here's a big problem that's facing a billion people. Let's go fix it.”

I think some of the biggest founders in the world, their companies poured out of their DNA. I started LearnVest because my father had passed away, and my mom overnight had to manage our finances. And I was like, I never want a family to feel financially destabilized, and I wanted to go build the solution.

When we look back at the broader ecosystem over the last 10 years, one of the big transitions is leaving behind that period of zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) for VC and startups. Have you seen a change in the venture ecosystem in the last few years, and has that affected the way you approach investing at Inspired?

So just a helpful framework — Inspired is a full generalist fund. We will touch everything from deep tech to health tech to consumer, looking for the biggest, most important ideas of the next 15 years. Every day, when I come to work, I literally mentally walk into this office in 2035. And that's how we're thinking about where the world is going and the problems be solved

And I think when ZIRP existed, many things that I would say weren't venture bets, would get backed. And I almost think it would be confusing, because you'd be like: What categories are not venture categories? Lots of categories are not venture categories by nature — if you think about power law, everything that we back ideally has a real chance to be worth $10 billion. There's not a lot of those.

I built LearnVest at the bottom of the worst recession in 81 years, and actually LearnVest was not an easy business. It was regulated, there were so many other things that were really hard about what we were doing. I really like hard businesses, because they have defensibility. They have reasons to exist. They have less copycats.

I think a lot of things got funded over the last period of, like, 2014 to 2021, that should've been getting a different source of capital.

How are you feeling about the state of fintech in 2025? Where are there still opportunities for startups?

I'm feeling both urgent and optimistic about the state of fintech today. Financial services remain foundational to a functioning society, but they haven't kept pace with the rapid technological, demographic, and social shifts we're experiencing. The growing federal debt, rising income inequality, and increasing poverty — especially among older Americans — underscore the need for more adaptive and inclusive financial tools. Not to mention the rapid job loss due to AI.

This moment presents a major opportunity for startups to reimagine financial products from the ground up. We think of this wave as fintech 3.0. The next wave of innovation won't come from superficial tweaks but from fundamental deep product reinvention — tools that meet the needs of a changing economy and a more diverse, digitally native population. We're excited by founders who see this challenge clearly and are building bold solutions to address it.

You launched LearnVest on-stage at the TechCrunch 50 conference in 2009. If you were a judge at our Startup Battlefield in 2025, what would you be looking for in the winning team? 

I would be looking for a founder who, based on who they are and their lived experience, has a powerful, unique insight to a problem that touches hundreds of millions of people, if not more. Two, I would be looking for something that is non-obvious. You know, I think some of the biggest and best ideas are non-consensus, people don't think they're interesting. Third, I would look for an entrepreneur who's living and breathing a decade out. They see this very powerful future. 

And the final thing I would look for is the founder who has — there's a spikiness, there's a grit and resilience, but also a command, that you can sit with them and you can like it's palpable, that they will figure out a way to succeed. Those are the key ingredients that you look for.

In reality ""evil"" people almost always want to genuinely make the world a better place, and they are fighting ""ignorant"" people who are dragging society down by not conforming to their golden vision. And then ""evil"" becomes largely a function of who you ask.There are very few leaders ever who are straight up storybook style evil. Almost all of them were/are deranged people who convinced enough people of their ostensibly good vision to begin executing it.No one came to power because they wanted to turn society into burning rumble while they ate babies during daily random execution time. It's all nuance and complication.

The world, at the highest levels of competition and leadership, doesn't run on morals, it runs on unscrupulous force, conquest and domination. See: the human history for the past infinity years.

Reminder - Iran offered support after 9/11 but instead we rebuffed them and called them part of the axis of evil just because. Right at a time when they were really modernizing again but our jingoistic attitudes entrenched the autocrats further.They agreed to a nuclear deal that we tore up just because.We overthrew their government.We have presidential candidates singing “bomb bomb bomb Iran” for fun.The reason we have a bad relationship with Iran and a large reason why they have bad leaders is because the US has made it so.

For some reason I have been fixated on license plate readers (probably not a bad parallel to Palantir?). Plenty of people on HN justifiably decry license plate readers due to their violation of our privacy (to be sure there's an argument to made though since you are technically ""in public"" when driving — your privacy protections might be on shaky legal grounds).But if license plate readers are already a reality (we know they are), why should only private actors have that data? This would make sense if we completely trusted those private actors, of course.The opposite could be a public, open-source license plate reader that caught on (people using dash cams + open software) — the data sent to a collective, public database. (Perhaps the software strips out personal license plates — only logging tags of official or government vehicles?).My first reaction is the degree to which that could be abused by ... stalkers? Truly a bad thing. But then I ask myself to what degree the private license plate readers are perhaps ""being abused"" (or will be more and more) and we don't even know about it.As I say, a thought experiment that I find myself seeing merits both for and against.

I'm not sure if you consider governments and police to be private actors?I spoke with a sophisticated ANPR city-wide tracking vendor recently at a conference.

I was taught many, many times growing up in the U.S. that people had a right to privacy, to free speech, to being considered innocent until proven guilty.When governmental organizations police the speech of individuals for things that are critical of the regime, we lose our right to free speech.When they download the contents of your phone when you travel, you lose the right to privacy.When people are denied a writ of habeas corpus, when they are trafficked to countries that are not from and have never been to, we are considered guilty unless we have people ""on the outside"" who are capable of fighting for our return.They aren't even trying to make an argument for this, outside of the cult of personality of the current regime, the belief that He can do no wrong. If you ""both-sides"" this you allow the trends to continue.

Closely related to this, I have been continually frustrated with the insistence of the left wing that it borders on immoral to take a job as a soldier, police officer, prison guard, or bailiff, and that there's no reason to raise any of their pay. That leaves the various armed forces around the country staffed with individuals who feel very little opposition to rote authoritarianism, corruption, and rule-by-force. There are relatively few individuals working in day-to-day policing or intelligence work that spend a lot of time thinking about the duty of agents of the state to follow its laws.

And yes, it's immoral to become a cop, just as it was immoral to become a european camp guard in the forties. There might be some mitigating factor like efficiently using it for infiltration and subversion because you didn't understand the morality of it until you were already employed, or being threatened into such a position.

Absolute wild take. Do you think every police department in the US oppresses minorities and infringes on civil rights or something?>just as it was immoral to become a european camp guard in the fortiesEven for the Allies? Given the prior sentence, I can't tell whether you're trying to allude to Nazi concentration camp guards, or actually think all camp guards are immoral.

There are some people who not only believe this but can make very compelling cases that this is the case. It's a dead-end rhetorical argument; yes, it is actually possible for literally every precinct in the US to violate people's civil rights.The difference is that some people, like (I suspect) the person you're responding to, seem to think that the position itself--armed law enforcement officer--is archetypically immoral and should not exist as a function or profession in a civilization. This is naive to to the point of absurdity and underwrites most of the idiocy that's widely abound in anti-policing movements. In one breath they claim that ""police"" are as a class immoral, and in the next they proclaim that their political opponents must be ""brought to justice"" by armed people following a set of written laws. It's absurd!

So introducing new microbiota won't solve the problem. The theory that needs to be tested is that we know microbiota can switch SAD on, but does removal of said microbiota turn it off? It needs to be an antibiotic cleansing. It can even be DIY. People can try this on themselves. I think the unknown factor here though is whether or not a persons diet is introducing the SAD causing microbiota.

But does the system have hysteresis? Can the flip be switched the other way?

The saying goes that a dog is a man's best friend, but an archaeological excavation in Norway proves that women care about their four-legged companions just as much as men do, even 1,100 years ago.

Archaeologists from the Arctic University Museum of Norway have revealed a 10th-century Viking boat grave on the Norwegian island of Senja. The buried individual is likely a woman who belonged to an elite class, as Science Norway first reported. Most notably, the team found a dog carefully buried at her feet.

“It appears to have been placed with real care,” Anja Roth Niemi, a museum archaeologist who presumably took part in the excavation, told Science Norway. “There are stories of prominent people doing everything in their power when their dog became ill. So even back then, people had deep bonds with their animals.”

A metal detectorist first discovered brooches and bone remains at the site just 7.9 inches (20 centimeters) beneath the ground two years ago. Suspecting the presence of a Viking woman's burial, the Arctic University Museum of Norway applied for permission to investigate and were finally able to conduct a proper excavation when the landowner decided to expand a garage on the property.

“After the upper layer of soil was removed, it became clear that this was a boat grave,” the museum wrote in a social media post. “The decayed wood from the boat was visible as a thin dark strip in the subsoil, with the site where the bowl brooches were found approximately in the middle.”

The work revealed a 17.7-foot-long (5.4-meter) boat in which a Viking woman and a dog were buried alongside objects associated with elite burials, including bone or amber beads, a pendant, and ornate brooches, according to Science Norway. This is not the first time archaeologists have found dog remains alongside Viking ones, but it provides further proof that dogs were prized companions even 1,100 years ago.

The brooches' design—oval with silver thread—helped the team date the grave to approximately 900 to 950 CE, as reported by Science Norway. They also indicate that the buried individual was a woman, given that oval brooches were usually Viking women's jewelry, though only bone analysis can confirm this beyond a doubt. Furthermore, the boat grave and grave goods altogether suggest that the woman was a high-class individual.

“Only the elite would receive a burial like this,” Niemi told Science Norway. Niemi and her colleagues also uncovered agricultural tools and textile instruments, the latter of which further associate the burial with Viking womanhood. Further analyses will confirm the individual's sex and shed light on her age, height, diet, and health, while also offering more insight into Viking burial traditions. Moreover, after discovering another brooch not too far from the burial, the archaeologists hope to continue investigating the area in the hopes of finding another grave.

According to the museum's post, the last days of the excavation were spent “recording all the contents of the grave and securing them for transport and storage until they can be examined in detail under controlled conditions at the laboratory in Tromsø.”

It is my hope that they keep the woman and her pet together in Tromsø, so that the dog can continue guarding its owner in the afterlife as it likely did when they were both alive.

When Superstorm Sandy made a beeline for New York City in October 2012, it flooded huge swaths of downtown Manhattan, leaving 2 million people without electricity and heat and damaging tens of thousands of homes. The storm followed a sweltering summer in New York City, with a procession of heat waves nearing 100 degrees.

For those who were pregnant at the time, enduring these extreme conditions wasn't just uncomfortable—it may have left a lasting imprint on their children's brains. That's according to a new study published on Wednesday in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS One. Using MRI scans, researchers at Queens College, City University of New York, found that children whose mothers lived through Superstorm Sandy had distinct brain differences that could hinder their emotional development. The effects were even more dramatic when people were exposed to extreme heat during their pregnancy, in addition to the tropical storm, the researchers found.

“It's not just one climate stressor or one isolated event, but rather a combination of everything,” said Donato DeIngeniis, the lead author of the study and a doctoral student in neuropsychology at the CUNY Graduate Center. DeIngeniis' study is the first of its kind to examine the joint effects of natural disasters and extreme heat—events that often coincide. A few years ago, scientists dubbed summer “danger season” since it's a time of colliding risks, including heat, hurricanes, wildfires, and toxic smoke. And summertime temperatures keep climbing to new heights.

The study analyzed brain imaging data from a group of 34 children, approximately 8 years old, whose mothers were pregnant during Superstorm Sandy—some of whom were pregnant at the time that Sandy made landfall, and some of whom were exposed to heat 95 degrees F or higher during their pregnancy. While the researchers didn't find that heat alone had much of an impact, living through Superstorm Sandy led to an increase in the basal ganglia's volume, a part of the brain that deals with regulating emotions.

While that larger size could be a compensation in response to stress, changes in the basal ganglia have been linked to behavioral challenges for children, such as depression and autism, DeIngeniis said.

“What we are seeing is compelling evidence that the climate crisis is not just an environmental emergency, it is potentially a neurological one with consequence for future generations who will inherit our planet,” said Duke Shereen, a co-author of the study and the director of the MRI facility at CUNY Graduate Center, in a press release. Global warming made Superstorm Sandy more damaging as a result of rising sea levels and higher ocean temperatures that might have amped up its rainfall.

Yoko Nomura, a co-author of the study and a psychology professor at the Queens College, CUNY, said that the time before birth is “very, very sensitive” for development because the fetus' body is changing so drastically. The human brain grows the most rapidly in the womb, reaching more than a third of its full adult volume before birth, according to the study. Any added stress at that time, even if small, “can have a much bigger impact,” Nomura said.

But that extra-sensitive period also presents a window of opportunity. “Developmental science, including the science in this paper, is exciting because it not only tells us what we can do to protect children from the effects of climate change, but it also tells us when we can step in to protect children to make the greatest difference,” Lindsey Burghardt, chief science officer at the Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University, said in an email.

Although there's a lot of evidence that prenatal stress generally can affect child brain development, according to DeIngeniis, research on climate-related stress specifically is lacking. “It is still a field that has potential for explosive growth,” said Jennifer Barkin, a professor at Mercer University School of Medicine in Macon, Georgia, who is studying the effects of last year's Hurricane Helene on maternal health.

DeIngeniis' study offers concrete evidence of how climate-charged events can affect the brain, Barkin said. “People have a hard time sometimes with mental health, because it's not like you can take an X-ray and see a broken bone.” But it's easier to understand imaging showing a difference in brain volume based on exposure to environmental stress, she said.

Barkin, who developed an index for measuring maternal health after childbirth, says that people are beginning to pay more attention to mothers and their mental health—not just in terms of delivering a healthy baby, but over the long term. “We tend to focus things on the child's outcome, which is important, but to keep the child healthy, the mother has to be healthy, too,” she said. “Because when Mom's struggling, the family's going to struggle.”

There's a lot of superpowered characters in Superman, and one of the most notable is Michael Holt, aka Mr. Terrific. It isn't just that this is his first time on the big screen, it's also the matter of who's playing him: Edi Gathegi, who many likely remember as Darwin from X-Men: First Class, aka the mutant who died despite having the power to evolve and adapt to anything.

Sooner or later, conversations about First Class remind you how dumb his death was, and Gathegi seems to agree. Talking to Entertainment Weekly, he noted the character's death “is just a case of bad representation and missed opportunity.” The actor explained that he wasn't put off by dying given Darwin's power (and superheroes dying on a regular basis), and hoped to return in later movies. But with each passing sequel, those chances became less likely, hence him calling it “misrepresentation and missed opportunity.”

In Gathegi's eyes, getting to suit up again in Superman as Terrific is a way of “undoing the wrongs of Darwin,” and a role he's excited to inhabit.He's previously described the hero as “an atheist who believes in justice,” which is informed by Holt losing his wife in a car crash. Following her death, Holt “found meaning in knowledge and saw that while the universe might be cruel, intelligence, science, and innovation could make it better. He chose to become hope rather than succumbing to the despair of losing his wife.”

After Superman releases on July 11, Mr. Terrific is expected to appear in future DC projects. Gathegi's not saying which, but we already can't wait to see him again.

Two of the most important companies behind China's semiconductor self-sufficiency and AI supremacy hopes were dealt a blow on Saturday, with their addition to Taiwan's strategic high-tech commodities entity list. Huawei and SMIC have already been sanctioned by the U.S., but the constriction of supplies from the Silicon Island could prove very meaningful and impactful. This news also comes in the wake of Huawei using shell companies to deceive TSMC into manufacturing two million banned advanced AI compute chiplets for the company. Hopefully, stricter government controls will prevent any similar mistakes in the future.

The move by Taiwan's democratically elected government, specifically the Taiwan Commerce Ministry, isn't particularly surprising, given the ongoing trade war sparked by concerns over the weaponization of cutting-edge technologies against Western allies. From now on, both Huawei and SMIC will need to obtain export permits from suppliers based in Taiwan to receive manufactured goods.

As entries on Taiwan's blacklist, Huawei and SMIC are nestled among entities such as the Taliban and al-Qaeda, as well as a smorgasbord of other companies and organizations hailing from pariah nations like Iran, Russia, Afghanistan, and North Korea. According to sources like Bloomberg and Taiwan's CNA, neither the newly blacklisted Chinese companies nor Taiwan's economy ministry has shared comments on the new list.

Back in November, the U.S. requested that TSMC halt supplies of a range of advanced chips to Chinese customers. We also reported on a huge fine being levied upon TSMC for unknowingly supplying Huawei with two million compute chiplets for its Ascend 910-series AI processors. This weekend's updated entity list might have been precipitated by negotiations about such matters behind closed doors.

Taiwan is home not only to the most famous element of the silicon shield, TSMC, but also to a host of other key semiconductor firms working on everything from materials to advanced packaging. It isn't just TSMC products that may be cut off from Huawei and SMIC; exports from established industry players, such as UMC, ASE, SPIL, Nanya, and others, will also be subject to the new restrictions.

This maker built a drone from scratch with no experience.

Tsung Xu, an engineer, has designed and manufactured a 3D-printed winged VTOL drone capable of flying for 130 continuous miles (approximately 3 hours) and posted an article and YouTube video (embedded below) detailing his efforts.

According to Xu, everything accomplished in this project was done without any prior knowledge of aerodynamic modeling, 3D printing, or CAD, and the process took 90 days. He outlined the project's progression in a log here.

Everything you see in this drone was designed and put together by Xu from scratch. Many of the components had to be modeled before they could be printed, as this design wasn't based on an existing plane. Xu confirms in the project details that the drone was printed using a Bambu Lab A1 printer, a device we gave 4.5 out of 5 stars to when reviewing.

It should go without saying that certain components, like the radio and motors, were sourced separately. When testing the setup, Xu stated that he was able to achieve a maximum flight time of approximately 3 hours, which translates to roughly 130 miles of flying time. This was made possible thanks to the integration of what Xu describes as a high energy density battery. No doubt the model design plays a factor in this performance, though, as well.

Unfortunately, we don't get an in-depth look at the build process. However, Xu assures us that the building of this winged VTOL drone was only made possible thanks to a handful of unique challenges. This ranged from things like taking the time to understand aerodynamic design to sourcing electrical components.

Earlier this week, we reported that the US Army is planning to implement more 3D printing and drone support in its tactical strategies, so it's neat to see the impact of the two fields (3D printing and FPV drones) on both an industrial scale and on an individual basis.

Accidental nostalgia hit from the Windows camp coincides with the unveiling of Apple's Vista-like UI for macOS 26 Tahoe.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A Windows bug-finding enthusiast has highlighted that the latest Insider Build in the Windows 11 Beta and Dev channels plays the Windows Vista startup sound as it boots to the desktop. However, Xeno's observation wasn't of an intentional slice of nostalgia aimed at the long-suffering Insiders. Microsoft Senior Program Manager on the Windows Insider Program Team, Brandon LeBlanc, admitted it was “an actual bug” after a bit of joking around.

The latest Windows 11 Insider Preview Build is 26200.5651 (Dev Channel) and the timing of its release coincides with Xeno's initial Tweet. This OS preview was heralded as bringing features such as new Copilot+ PC experiences, a new Recall export function, a bigger clock/calendar in the notification center, and more.

If the Microsoft exec's statement is correct, no one intended to change the default startup chime to the one used across the Windows Vista and Windows 7 eras. So the surprising retro refrain is an actual ‘known issue' in the latest flight.

It's an actual bug.June 13, 2025

Other Twitter/X users jumped in on the initial post by Xeno that highlighted the incongruous startup sound. At one point LeBlanc joked that the ‘issue' was precipitated after he “went in and had some fun with the sound files in Windows and thought folks needed a blast from the past.”

It was then suggested the Windows 95 startup sound would be a good choice for the impending 30th anniversary of its launch (August 24). But LeBlanc continued to make mirth, stating he couldn't find that correct .WAV file for that OS release. With his official responsibility as a Microsoft exec in mind, LeBlanc must have felt it necessary to then make clear he was joking, and the startup sound mix-up was “an actual bug.”

The timing of the above Windows snafu is almost comical, with Apple under criticism for unintentionally (?) reviving the glassy Windows Aero aesthetic with its latest macOS 26 Tahoe release. This OS will be the final one to support the aging fleet of Intel Macs that are still in use.

Rare Ampere-era GPU highlights a memory-boosted variant that never hit the market


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A rare engineering sample of the Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition with 20GB of VRAM was recently sold in an auction on eBay. This specific variant never managed to reach retail, thus making it one of the most unusual Ampere-era GPUs to surface online. According to the listing, the auction concluded with the buyer offering $1,999, which is pretty wild for a high-end graphics card that is two-generations old.

The seller included photos of the GPU, showing the original packaging box and a bright green sticker on the GPU that reads, “Not for sale, for development only.” The seller also confirmed that the unit is in excellent condition and fully functional. However, since it is not a retail product, running games or any 3D workloads would require the use of a third-party driver such as Nvidia-patcher, as there are no official drivers available for this card. This could potentially translate to poor or unstable performance, although that remains unconfirmed.

The retail version of the RTX 3080 Ti made its official debut in June 2021 with a starting price of $1,199. It featured 12GB of GDDR6X memory and was essentially an RTX 3090 with half the VRAM and a smaller cooling solution. Introduced midway through Nvidia's regular product cycle, it offered higher specifications and performance compared to the RTX 3080.

The first rumors of a 20GB RTX 3080 Ti sparked back in December 2020 when a Gigabyte EEC listing revealed several RTX 3080 Ti 20GB models. This was followed by a firmware anonymously uploaded to TechPowerUp, meant specifically for Gigabyte's range of RTX 3080 Ti 20GB GPUs.

Eventually, in September 2021, a few months after the official launch of the RTX 3080 Ti, a cryptocurrency miner revealed in a YouTube video that retailers in Russia were selling Gigabyte branded RTX 3080 Ti 20GB GPUs ranging from $2,733 to $2,837. The individual managed to get hold of a rare Gigabyte Aorus GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Xtreme (GV-N308TAORUS X-20GD), which was purchased from HARDVAR, a retail store in Saint Petersburg. At the time of posting the video, the GPU was priced at $3,067.

The video also revealed that the only difference between the two GeForce RTX 3080 Ti models was the memory capacity. The 20GB variant offered a 67% increase in GDDR6X memory compared to the standard 12GB version. However, the higher memory model came with a narrower 320-bit memory bus instead of 384-bit. As a result, the 20GB model had lower memory bandwidth of 760 GBps compared to 912 GBps on the 12GB version.

It is possible that the RTX 3080 Ti 20GB was planned as a counter to AMD's high-VRAM Radeon offerings at the time. Perhaps it was intended to target users who prioritized memory capacity for gaming, crypto, or creative workloads. Whether Nvidia changed its mind due to production constraints, shifting strategy, or overlapping performance tiers, this unreleased GPU will likely go on to become a ""what-if"" in Nvidia's Ampere lineup.

Only one of the RTX 4090s is legit


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A Chinese hardware repair YouTuber received four allegedly faulty RTX 4090 graphics cards that needed repairing. The YouTuber discovered that three of the four cards were fake graphics cards modded from RTX 3090s and RTX 3080s to look like the real deal. The three fake cards had to be scrapped since they were apparently incapable of running. The customer of the four GPUs apparently paid $1,394 (10,000 yuan) for each GPU and purchased all four from an overseas vendor or supplier.

The Chinese repair YouTuber shared key insights to detect fake RTX 4090s. For starters, the QR code on every legitimate RTX 4090 is located on the very bottom left corner of the GPU substrate. On legitimate RTX 3090s and RTX 3080s, the QR code is located in the same area but slightly above the bottom left corner of the substrate. Most modders will allegedly not move the QR code of a GPU die they are trying to make look like another one, making this an easy way to verify whether an RTX 4090 is real.

the next level of the 4090 scam.according to 张哥,this time the surrounding mlcc position is correct, the qr code position is also correct.however the color of the PCB substrate is too fake, and the metal frame on the substrate is not fully attached.bilibili 修电脑的张哥… pic.twitter.com/tnQMBs8zOeJune 14, 2025

Additionally, RTX 30 series GPUs have a capacitor on the top right of the substrate that allegedly protrudes up a little bit; by contrast, the RTX 4090 does not.

As previously mentioned, three of the four RTX 4090s were faulty, featuring RTX 30 series GPU dies with modified laser engravings designed to deceive users into believing they were genuine RTX 4090s. The first one featured a QR code in the wrong area and fake VRAM, according to the YouTuber. The second GPU sported a scarred ""AD102"" die with the same QR code issue as the first card. The third GPU was by far the worst, sporting an abnormal green substrate and a substrate plate that was skinnier than the same plate on a real RTX 4090. The substrate plate was in such bad shape that the frame wasn't fully seated onto the substrate itself.

Only one of the RTX 4090s was real, featuring legitimate damage that needed to be fixed. The YouTuber discovered that some of the GDDR6X chips and some of the capacitors on the back of the board were bad. After replacing two of the faulty GDDR6X chips with new ones and fixing the rear capacitors, the card sprang to life and ran stably with no issues.

Selling counterfeit RTX 4090 graphics cards is sadly a common practice in today's GPU market. Thanks to the incredible value and high demand of Nvidia's previous-gen flagship, criminals can profit from stripping an old RTX 30-series graphics card and modifying it to look like an RTX 4090. Nvidia's Ampere-based GA102 die and memory configuration are similar enough to those of the AD102 GPUs that it can be easy to fake one to look like the other. However, it doesn't always have to be a GA102 chip; scams have also been seen where an RTX 4080 is falsely listed as an RTX 4090.

Thankfully, there have not been any major reports of fake RTX 5090s in the wild. But with how high the demand and how expensive the RTX 5090 is, it seems inevitable that modders will figure out how to sell fake RTX 5090s in the future as well.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

Impacts most, if not all, CPUs from Zen+ through Zen 5 architectures.

Board partners are now rolling out freshly baked BIOS updates based on AMD's AGESA 1.2.0.3e firmware. The updates are designed to patch a security flaw that could allow hackers to read sensitive data stored within the TPM (Trusted Platform Module), via VideoCardz. At least for some manufacturers, this BIOS update is a one-way street; you cannot roll back to an older release once you install it.

Hackers can exploit this security flaw by triggering an out-of-bounds read beyond the TPM2.0 routine. By doing so, these unauthorized users can gain access to sensitive data or disrupt the TPM's functionality as a whole. This stems from a bug (CVE-2025-2884), ranked 6.6 (Medium) on the CVSS scale, in TPM2.0's Module Library, which refers to standardized code that TPM 2.0 chips use for various functions.

While the AGESA 1.2.0.3e firmware only targets AM5-based processors, the security bug it addresses impacts a much wider range of AMD CPUs. Hence, it's best to consult the official security bulletin to determine if a mitigation is available for your processor. What makes this particular bug concerning is its accessibility, since it can be exploited using standard user-mode privileges, meaning an attacker doesn't need kernel-level access. This is a significant difference from previous vulnerabilities, including one that could execute unsigned microcode but required kernel-level access.

Impacted processors include a wide range of Ryzen processors between Athlon 3000 ""Dali"" / Ryzen 3000 ""Matisse"" and Ryzen 9000 ""Granite Ridge"" on desktop, and between Ryzen 3000 Mobile ""Picasso"", and Ryzen AI 300 ""Strix Point"" on mobile. Similarly, all workstation CPUs from Threadripper 3000 ""Castle Peak"" to Threadripper 7000 ""Storm Peak"" are also vulnerable to this bug. That being said, patches for most of these processors have been deployed across different timelines in the past few months. AM5-based CPUs are the most recent and are the latest to receive the update.

Several motherboard partners, including Asus and MSI, have started to roll out BIOS updates based on the new AGESA 1.2.0.3e firmware. In addition to fixing the aforementioned TPM flaw, this firmware also adds support for a new and upcoming Ryzen CPU, likely alluding to Ryzen 9000F series processors. It is best to consult your motherboard vendor's support page to see if a new BIOS is available, and update accordingly.

 June 15, 2025  

MILAN — Combining polatuzumab vedotin (Pola) with rituximab, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin (R-GemOx) significantly improves survival outcomes in patients with transplant-ineligible, relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), according to new data from the phase 3 POLARGO trial.

Presented by Matthew Matasar, MD, chief of the division of blood disorders at Rutgers Cancer Institute, New Brunswick, New Jersey, here at the European Hematology Association (EHA) 2025 Annual Meeting, the study showed a 40% reduction in the relative risk of death with Pola-R-GemOx versus R-GemOx alone. ""These are the gems of the congress,"" said Martin Dreyling, MD, scientific program committee chair for EHA2025, who presided over the session, describing this and similar studies as potentially practice-changing.

The global trial enrolled 270 patients with R/R DLBCL who were ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant, had received at least one prior line of therapy, and had not previously been treated with Pola. Of those, 255 were randomized 1:1 to receive Pola-R-GemOx or R-GemOx every 21 days for up to 8 cycles. Patients were stratified by age (≤70 vs >70 years), prior lines of therapy (1 vs ≥2), and response to the most recent treatment (relapsed vs refractory). Baseline characteristics were well-balanced between groups; two thirds were treated in the second-line setting and most had refractory disease.

At a median follow-up of 24.6 months, the primary endpoint was met: median overall survival (OS) was 19.5 months with Pola-R-GemOx versus 12.5 months with R-GemOx (hazard ratio [HR], 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43-0.83; P = .0017). Two-year OS was 44.0% versus 33.2%, respectively.

Progression-free survival (PFS) also significantly improved at a median follow-up of 18.7 months (HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.27-0.51; P = .0001), increasing from 2.7 months to 7.4 months. The 12-month PFS was 36.6% for Pola-R-GemOx and 17.9% for R-GemOx.

Response rates were nearly double in the experimental group. The overall response rate (ORR) was 52.7% versus 24.6% and the complete response rate was 40.3% versus 19.0%, respectively, as assessed by an independent review committee.

The OS benefit was consistent across subgroups, including those with and without bulky disease, and among both primary refractory and non-refractory patients. Notably, survival benefit was seen in both activated B-cell (ABC) and germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtypes — contrary to prior findings from the POLARIX trial, which had suggested preferential benefit in the ABC subtype.

Matasar emphasized the robustness of the results, noting that patients receiving R-GemOx underwent more subsequent lines of therapy, ruling out confounding by post-progression treatment access.

However, the enhanced efficacy came with increased toxicity. Patients in the Pola-R-GemOx group received a median of 7.5 cycles versus 4 cycles in the R-GemOx group. Treatment discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) were more common with Pola-R-GemOx (23.4% vs 8.0%). Grade 3-4 AE rates were similar (57.0% vs 58.4%), though thrombocytopenia and infections were more frequent in the experimental group. Infections were the leading cause of grade 5 AEs, including 10 COVID-related deaths (seven during treatment, three after completion). ""It's worth remembering that the study was conducted during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Matasar noted.

Peripheral neuropathy, an expected AE due to overlapping neurotoxicities of Pola and oxaliplatin, was observed in 57.0% of patients receiving Pola-R-GemOx versus 28.8% with R-GemOx. Most cases were grade 1, but 3.9% of patients in the experimental group had grade 3 events. ""Peripheral neuropathy was not permanent in all patients, approximately half of the patients did experience improvement in neuropathy by the time of study closure, and approximately one third of patients had complete resolution,"" Matasar reported.

Commenting to Medscape Medical News, Frank Leebeek, MD, PhD, chair of hematology at Erasmus University, Rotterdam, Netherlands, who was not involved in the trial, said: ""This is very important. Prognosis remains poor for patients with R/R DLBCL who cannot receive or are ineligible for transplant."" He welcomed the new option in the arsenal of treatments for this disease. 

Concluding his presentation, Matasar stressed the importance of having different tools. ""Some patients will be appropriate for CAR-T, some for bispecific antibodies, some will have access to neither and benefit from ADC destination therapy. Pola-R-GemOx represents an alternative treatment option,"" he said.

Leebeek noted that Pola-R-GemOx may serve as a bridge therapy to CAR-T because it does not deplete the T-cell population. ""Achieving complete remission after relapse is challenging,"" he said, ""and other regimens can impair the T-cell pool, while this one doesn't.""

The study was funded by F. Hoffmann-La Roche. Matasar has disclosed financial relationships with ADC Therapeutics, AbbVie, Arvinas, AstraZeneca, Bayer, BMS, Genmab, Ipsen, J&J, Kite, Novartis, Regeneron, Roche, and Pfizer, and research support from Allogene, Arvinas, Bayer, Cellectis, Genentech, J&J, Pfizer, Pharmacyclics, Regeneron, and Roche. He has reported serving as a consultant for AbbVie, Allogene, Arvinas, Bayer, BMS, Genentech, Genmab, Kite, Novartis, Pfizer, and Roche, and being a current equity holder of Merck. Leebeek has reported no relevant financial relationships.

The 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup starts this weekend, and the United States Men's National Team's path to an eighth Gold Cup title kicks off Sunday, June 15 in San Jose, California against Trinidad and Tobago. The USMNT will continue their group stage with back-to-back matches in Texas against Saudi Arabia on Thursday, June 19 and Haiti on Sunday, June 22.

Head coach Mauricio Pochettino released his 26-player roster last week, and it includes a mix of familiar faces and young talent. Miles Robinson, the hero for the United States in the 2021 Gold Cup final victory over Mexico, appears alongside other stalwart defenders such as Walker Zimmerman, Tim Ream and goalkeeper Matt Turner. Their experience will lead a group that is the third youngest to start the Gold Cup for the United States.

The USMNT looks to continue its command in the biennial tournament that has crowned the U.S. continental champions seven out of 17 times. Historically, the United States has dominated the group stage, totaling a 40-1-5 record and winning their group in 16 out of 17 Gold Cups, including the most recent competition in 2023.

Here's a look at the upcoming group stage schedule for the United States and the opponents:

FIFA World Ranking: No. 100

The United States has dominated the series against Trinidad and Tobago, winning 17 of 18 meetings on American soil. The most recent matchup between the two sides came November 2023 in the Concacaf Nations League tournament. At Port of Spain, the capital city of Trinidad and Tobago, the Americans played more than 50 minutes down to 10 men, and Trinidad and Tobago took advantage to record a 2-1 win. Playing in the States – which the Gold Cup primarily does — gives the USMNT a huge advantage, winning 17 of 18 matches against Trinidad and Tobago and outscoring the Caribbean nation 41-0 over the last 12.

With a win Sunday, the United States could equal its longest home winning streak against any opponent, tying with Ecuador, which the U.S. has beaten 16 consecutive times.

Kickoff: Sunday, June 15, 2025 – 6:00 p.m. ET at PayPal Park (San Jose, Calif.)

FIFA World Ranking: No. 58

The United States has only faced Saudi Arabia once in the past five years, a scoreless draw in an international friendly in September 2022. Before then, Saudi Arabia appeared in the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar where it most notably shocked the soccer world and defeated Argentina early in the group stage, handing the eventual and current reigning World Cup champions their only loss of the tournament.

Saudi Arabia enters the Gold Cup still alive in qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, earning a result in three of their last four AFC qualifying matches. This is the highest-ranked opponent the United States will face in the group stage.

Kickoff: Thursday, June 19, 2025 – 9:15 p.m. ET at Q2 Stadium (Austin, Texas)

FIFA World Ranking: No. 83

The United States has a longstanding history playing against Haiti, and the series dates all the way back to 1941 when the USSF was known as the U.S. Football Association. While Haiti owned the first half of the all-time series, the United States has been the far better team over the past several decades and has not lost to Haiti since 1973. The two nations have met four times in Gold Cup action, and the USA has never lost, earning three wins and one draw.

Kickoff: Sunday, June 22, 2025 – 7:00 p.m. ET at AT&T Stadium (Arlington, Texas)

The Gold Cup quarterfinals will be held June 28-June 29 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz. and U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis. The semifinals take place July 2 at Energizer Park in St. Louis and Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. 

Sixteen teams will look to make it to Houston, Texas where the final will be played at NRG Stadium on July 6. Among those in contention are defending champions Mexico in Group A. The United States and Mexico have dominated the tournament, and the two countries have combined to win 16 out of 17 times. Mexico won the last time around in 2023, beating a Panama side that outlasted the United States in penalty kicks in the semis. The Americans won the Gold Cup prior in 2021, swiping the trophy from Mexico thanks to Robinson's epic game-winning header in extra time.

SAN JOSE, Calif. — By now, you may have heard that Christian Pulisic isn't with the U.S. men's national team preparing for the Concacaf Gold Cup, which the Americans kick off on Sunday against Trinidad and Tobago (coverage begins at 6 p.m. ET on FOX).

But before and after the USMNT went through its final pre-tournament training session on Saturday, Pulisic's absence continued to be a hot topic. 

For the uninitiated, Pulisic asked not to participate in the Gold Cup because of fatigue following two grueling seasons with Italian club AC Milan. That decision was roundly criticized by a number of former U.S. legends, most notably Landon Donovan.

On Thursday, Pulisic finally explained his reasoning during an interview with CBS Sports, and revealed that he wanted to play in this month's two pre-Gold Cup exhibitions versus Türkiye and Switzerland. Pochettino, who wanted to use the same squad all summer, turned him down.

""That's the coach's decision,"" Pulisic said. ""I fully respect that. I didn't understand it, but it is what it is.""

During his pregame press conference on Saturday, I asked Pochettino about Pulisic's comments. The former Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham Hotspur manager didn't hold back.

""Players don't need to understand,"" Pochettino said. ""Players need to listen and to stick with our plan. They cannot dictate the plan.

""He explained why he only wanted to be involved in two games and not the Gold Cup, and I respect that,"" added Pochettino. ""I understand him. But I do need that he understands our decision.

""When I signed my contract with the [U.S. Soccer] Federation, I am the head coach. I am not a mannequin.""

Pulisic also told CBS, whose parent company produces a documentary series on him, that he hasn't spoken with Pochettino much since the Argentine was hired last September on a contract through next summer's World Cup.

""We had one phone call where we discussed everything,"" Pulisic said. ""He understood kind of where I was coming from, and that' as much conversation as I've had with him.""

Pochettino said that he makes sure not to talk to any particular player more than any other, so it doesn't seem like he's playing favorites.

""I love to be in communication with my players,"" the 53-year-old said. ""I love to communicate, but at the same time, I want to [ensure] that all the players feel the same respect from the coaching staff and from myself.""

A few hours earlier, before the Americans trained in nearby Santa Clara ahead of Sunday's match at PayPal Park, home of the San Jose Earthquakes, U.S. veteran Chris Richards was asked about what has become a public feud between Pulisic and Donovan.

""At the end of the day, we're just focused on the people that are here,"" Richards said. ""Of course, Christian's a big part of our group. But he's not here. So we just focus on the people who are here and who are ready to win. That's been kind of our big message.""

It has to be. For a team that enters the regional championship having lost four consecutive games, beating the Soca Warriors has to be where all their energy and attention is directed. A win on Sunday would help put the spotlight back on the field.

""I think in the last few months, we've had a lot of people talking kind of down on the team, which is okay,"" Richards said. ""We love our fans. We love our haters as well. So we kind of take that and it gives us motivation to, hopefully, change the narrative.""

After a poor start to June, the U.S. men's national team is kicking off its 2025 Gold Cup campaign against Trinidad and Tobago. 

Just a few months ago, the USMNT would have been one of the favorites to dethrone Mexico as Gold Cup champions. Except the Stars and Stripes' best players, including Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson, Folarin Balogun and Sergiño Dest, are missing out on this summer's tournament due to injury or personal reasons.

The Stars and Stripes in turn have suffered two defeats to Türkiye and Switzerland in the lead up to the Gold Cup. The pressure is on Mauricio Pochettino to get the USMNT back to winning ways against Trinidad and Tobago, but he might have to do so without Tyler Adams, who is still dealing with a foot injury.

Here's what the Stars and Stripes' XI could look like to kick off the Gold Cup.

GK: Matt Freese—The NYCFC shot-stopper is set to return to the starting lineup after Matt Turner conceded four goals against Switzerland.

RB: Alex Freeman—With Dest yet to make his return to the national team, Freeman gets the big opportunity to be Pochettino's starting man on the right flank.

CB: Chris Richards—Richards will hope to translate his stellar season for Crystal Palace to this summer's tournament for the United States. 

CB: Mark McKenzie—The center back will be eager to put in a better shift just four days after the Stars and Stripes' embarrassing defensive performance at GEODIS Park.

LB: Max Arfsten—Although he is at his best as a left wing-back, Arfsten will have to focus on his defensive responsibilities for the USMNT.

DM: Johnny Cardoso—Cardoso put together an impressive campaign for Real Betis this past season, but has struggled to perform under Pochettino. The pressure is on the midfielder to rediscover his form or risk losing his starting spot.

DM: Luca de la Torre—De la Torre returns to the starting lineup to partner Cardoso in the midfield.

RW: Jack McGlynn—The Houston Dynamo forward scored the USMNT's only goal in the last 180 minutes. He should have little trouble finding success against Trinidad and Tobago's leaky backline.

AM: Malik Tillman—The midfielder is coming off a career-best season with PSV in which he bagged 16 goals in the team's Eredivisie-winning campaign. Tillman has been one of the bright spots for an undermanned USMNT side in June.

LW: Diego Luna—The 21-year-old created the most chances in the USMNT's defeat to Türkiye and should once again get the nod on the left wing.

ST: Brian White—White is third in the MLS Golden Boot race with 10 goals in 12 appearances for the Vancouver Whitecaps. The striker will hope to impress in what could be just his fifth international cap.

The U.S. men's national team is short-handed and under intense scrutiny as it kicks off its 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup campaign with a game against Trinidad and Tobago.

The USMNT's biggest star, Christian Pulisic, will controversially be rested for the tournament, while other big names like Weston McKennie are instead obliged to play at the overlapping FIFA Club World Cup. Making matters worse, a 4-0 embarrassment at the hands of Switzerland on Tuesday served as a reminder that entry-level basics in terms of intensity and effort have been in question for some time now.

Manager Mauricio Pochettino — who came in at significant expense after the U.S. badly underwhelmed at the 2024 Copa América — has run into the same sorts of issues that sunk his predecessor, Gregg Berhalter. On a four-game losing streak for the first time since 2007, the USMNT is under pressure to produce a comfortable win over the Soca Warriors.

Here is what to know for Sunday's Gold Cup game between the USMNT and Trinidad and Tobago:

Check out the stats behind Inter Miami's 0-0 draw to open the FIFA Club World Cup. (0:33)

MIAMI, Florida -- Inter Miami CF and Al Ahly played out a 0-0 draw in front of a healthy crowd on the opening night of FIFA's Club World Cup on Saturday.

Egyptian side Al Ahly had the best opportunity to find a goal, but Trézéguet saw a first-half penalty saved by Miami goalkeeper Oscar Ustari, who had an outstanding opening 45 minutes.

Lionel Messi, starting the game just four days after appearing for Argentina in the World Cup qualifier against Colombia, was brighter after half-time and almost helped Miami snatch a winner.

He went close with a free kick, almost set up Fafà Picault with a late header which was tipped over and hit the bar with an effort in stoppage-time.

There were few fireworks on the pitch, but FIFA will count the turn out for the game at Miami Dolphins' Hard Rock stadium as a big win. Despite fears over a low attendance ahead of kick-off, more than 60,000 fans came to watch the opening game of the newly expanded tournament. -- Rob Dawson

When a squad headlined by Messi and Luis Suárez takes the field, few expect for anyone else to shine. However, goalkeeper Ustari managed to steal the show from his world-renowned teammates against Al Ahly in the Club World Cup opener.

In the first half alone, the goalkeeper made four crucial saves from open play to deny the Egyptians an early lead. Inter Miami's defensive struggles exposed Ustari to the speed of Al Ahly's forwards, forcing the goalkeeper into a number of perfectly timed saves. But it wasn't until the 46th minute that Ustari cemented his man-of-the-match status by saving the match-defining penalty. For the first time since Oct. 28, 2022, Ustari stopped a shot from the spot -- helping keep Inter Miami level.

Though the 38-year-old joined Inter Miami in September 2024, Ustari only recently became the starting goalkeeper after Drake Callender suffered a long-term injury in January. The two-time Argentina international worked himself up from the bench to the crucial figure that saved Inter Miami from embarrassment on the global stage.

Ustari finished the team's first match of the Club World Cup with eight saves, more than the amount of shots on goal (5) from Inter Miami. The goalkeeper deserves recognition for his performance, but his starring role against Al Ahly probably only exposes Inter Miami's weaknesses. Ustari may not be enough to save the team's struggling defense and injury-laden roster from Group A's other opponents, FC Porto and Palmeiras. -- Lizzy Becherano

Al Ahly were by far the better team in the first half, but just couldn't find a goal.

As early as the eighth minute, Inter Miami's defence was being cut open when Emam Ashour went clean through. Wessam Abou Ali thought he'd scored after 30 minutes but his effort was ruled out for offside. It was just before the break when Ustari capped off an impressive first-half performance by saving Trezeguet's penalty.

Despite Inter Miami's better second half, Al Ahly will feel like they've missed an opportunity.

With the 2024-25 season officially over, it's time to rank the top 100 players in the world of men's soccer right now. Welcome to the FC 100. Read the full list here.

Group A is one of the more modest and there's a realistic chance for any of the four teams to qualify. Al Ahly will now likely need to beat either Palmeiras or Porto to qualify and after drawing with Miami -- a task that won't be easy. They will have had hopes of doing well in the U.S. after finishing third in the smaller version of the tournament in Saudi Arabia 2023. After an opening draw in a game they probably should have won, it will be uphill from here. -- Dawson

FIFA will be happy that the Hard Rock Stadium was nearly full for the opening game of the Club World Cup. Huge gaps in the stands for the big kick-off would have been embarrassing for president Gianni Infantino. There were empty seats scattered throughout the tiers -- the attendance was announced as 60,927 with Hard Rock's capacity around 65,000 -- but the crowd was big enough for FIFA to count it as a success.

They were helped by thousands of supporters wearing Al Ahly colours. There were as many red shirts as pink Inter Miami ones and the Egyptian fans were far louder.

Despite FIFA's insistence that this is a serious competition, there was still a pre-season feel about some of it. The players were individually introduced before running onto the pitch ahead of the kick-off and at half-time a collection of football legends faced off against YouTuber IShowSpeed in a crossbar challenge. Former Italian great Alessandro Del Piero won.

Ref cam was a positive addition to the coverage. The camera attached to Australian A-League Men official Alireza Faghani gave a close up of his view when he awarded a first-half penalty to Al Ahly, subsequently missed by former Aston Villa forward Trezeguet. -- Dawson","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Inter Miami's Lionel Messi inspires bright second half in Club World Cup opener, but Egypt's Al Ahly hold on for 0-0 draw.

Lionel Messi led a strong second-half resurgence from Inter Miami in a surprisingly thrilling 0-0 draw with Al Ahly in Group A to open the FIFA Club World Cup in Florida.

The Argentinian forward, much like the rest of his teammates, had a quiet first half at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami on Saturday.

Egyptian giants Al Ahly dominated the play and the chances in the opening 45 minutes but were denied on numerous occasions by Inter keeper Oscar Ustari.

It appeared that the 39-year-old's efforts were going to be in vain going in at the break, when Trezeguet stepped up from the spot in the 43rd minute, but Ustari was equal to the Al Ahly threat once more.

The second period was a vastly improved performance by the Major League Soccer side, and ended with Messi thumping a long-range effort off the bar.

Al Ahly keeper Mohamed El Shenawy managed to get fingertips onto Messi's late left-footed curler.

The stopper had to be just as alert from the resulting corner – deep into stoppage time – to deny Maximiliano Falcon's header.

It was his opposite number, Ustari, who kept his side in the contest at the break, leading Inter manager Javier Mascherano to reflect that his side were only “alive” thanks to their keeper.

Wessam Abou Ali and Emam Ashour were both denied from close-range chances, but the big moment came after Zizo cut into the box before being clipped from behind by Telasco Segovia.

Former Premier League player with Aston Villa, Trezeguet, stepped up from the spot and sent his kick to his left – the keeper guessed correctly and made the save.

“I'm happy with the performance. It was much better in the second half,” Mascherano continued in conversation with broadcaster DAZN after the full-time whistle.

“In the first period, we lost some balls and some transitions, where they are very dangerous.

“We dominated the second half and had the chances to win the game.”

Inter's first big chance came just a few minutes after the break, when Tadeo Allende was denied with a similarly smothering save from Al Ahly keeper El Shenawy as had been seen by his opposite number early in the piece.

The possession and pressure had clearly switched to the home side, who looked a vastly different side to the showing in the opening 45 minutes.

Messi hit the side netting with a free kick, and was a constant thorn in the side of the Egyptians, who, with 155 trophies, are the most successful side in the world.

It was late in the game, though, that a short corner taken by Messi was rolled back to him on the right and he whipped a shot to the far post, only for the keeper to tip it onto the bar and over.

The recovery by the home side was even more impressive given the extraordinary turnout of Egyptian fans, who made themselves heard from start to finish.

Their team, however, could not do the same with their performance on the field.

“It's not about what went wrong. We had a decent amount of chances in the first half to put the game into a different space. We couldn't,” Al Ahly's new manager, Jose Riviera, told DAZN after the match.

“In the second half, we had a time where we were suffering, but a lot of positives and things to correct to do better next time.

“It seems like we were playing in Cairo. It was a big surprise for me in my first match. Hopefully, next time, we can give them a victory.”

The second match of the group is played on Sunday between Palmeiras of Brazil and Porto of Portugal.

Inter then face Porto, while Al Ahly face Palmeiras in the next round of fixtures on Thursday.

Club World Cup

Follow live coverage of Paris Saint-Germain vs Atletico Madrid and Bayern Munich vs Auckland City at the Club World Cup today

The football world knows where Lionel Messi plays these days. They may not have known much more beyond that. Saturday night's Club World Cup opener, a scoreless draw between Inter Miami and Al Ahly, revealed the hard truth about Messi's new team.

With more than 60,000 fans in attendance at Hard Rock Stadium, and many millions more watching from their homes around the globe, Miami looked pedestrian on the big stage. It wasn't down to a lack of effort. Both teams were aggressive, but on this night, it was Miami that had the big names. 

Messi was omnipresent, but Sergio Busquets struggled to make a difference in his holding midfield role. It was another example of the World Cup winner's steady decline as a top-flight footballer. Busquets was once connected telepathically to Messi in midfield. Today, the 36-year-old's once trademark pull-back drag is too slow to fool an opposing player.

The same goes for Luis Suarez. The Uruguayan is an authoritative presence in the Miami dressing room. He has taken on the role of club spokesperson in the early stages of the tournament, something that Messi clearly has no interest in doing. But on the Hard Rock Stadium pitch, which played well on opening night, Suarez too was ineffective as a No 9. He could not beat the faster and more agile Al Ahly defenders, so he turned provider. 

Some of Suarez's best plays came away from the six-yard box where for years, for Liverpool, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid, he would score goals for fun. He fought through the knee pain he lives with and ran until the final whistle on Saturday. But it was hard to watch for those who remember the former Nacional academy product as a lethal force in front of goal. 

Miami is, as Al Ahly manager Jose Riveiro said on Friday, “a team with big names”, but Miami is limited beyond that. 

After a disjointed performance in the first 45 minutes, Miami regained composure and played much better in the second half. Despite the scoreline, this was an entertaining match with both teams desperate for the three points that would have felt like a lottery win in a group that includes Porto and Palmeiras. Saturday was an opportunity for Miami to avoid feeling desperate for a victory against two much stronger opponents.

“We know how Leo approaches a tournament like this one,” Suarez said after the match. “It's an important challenge for him and we have to be there alongside him. We also know how difficult this tournament is going to be. We have to take advantage of the opportunity to continue to grow as a team because it'll help us throughout this year.” 

And that's the dilemma that Miami is facing at this Club World Cup. 

Perhaps the results will not matter much, but the experience of playing in the competition will prove far more valuable in years to come. And yet, in Messi they have a serial winner who understands his team's shortcomings, but who cannot seem to turn off the competitive switch that makes him one of the sport's greatest-ever players. Messi needs help. He cannot carry this team on his own. On Friday, head coach Javier Mascherano attempted to remain optimistic about his team's chances to play a significant part in the tournament.

“This is another level, one we're not accustomed to,” he said. “Even if we have four players who are used to it for the past 15 years. We need their mentality to be contagious. Why not us?”

But Mascherano's frustration with the team's lack of new players before the tournament also reached a boiling point on the eve of the opening match. Miami did not make any new signings during the short-term transfer window in June that FIFA created to allow teams to strengthen their tournament squads. A number of teams added new players, whether as new signings or loan deals. Miami did nothing.

“I've been saying this for a while now: I'm in charge of preparing the team and to train the players that I'm given,” said Mascherano. “I would've liked to have new signings, clearly, especially considering this competition. We're possibly in the most important tournament in this club's history. It's a club with little history but this is the most important tournament they've been in.

“I can only concern myself with what I can control and what I myself can do. Eventually, every person will have to accept their own responsibilities, and each person will have to own what corresponds to them.”

Mascherano's less-than-subtle dig at the club's sporting department set the stage for Saturday's match. The former Argentina national team captain, who is in his first job as the coach of a professional club, set low expectations and appeared to throw in the towel before the first kick of the tournament. After the draw against Al Ahly, Mascherano changed his messaging, rather drastically. 

“When we saw in the second half that this is the way: to be fearless and to ignore any time of pressure we may be feeling,” he told reporters. “When we play like that, we can match up with any team.”

Suarez predicted on Friday that there would be some surprise results at the tournament. “Let's hope it comes from our end, but we know how difficult it's going to be,” he added. There were no surprises at Hard Rock Stadium. Miami played like the team that has been wildly inconsistent during MLS play in 2025. The lack of squad depth was evident. 

If it hadn't been for Oscar Ustari, the 38-year-old Miami goalkeeper, Miami could have been embarrassed. Ustari's saves — including a penalty in the 43rd minute — kept Al Ahly at bay when the Egyptian side dominated play early. In the end, both goalkeepers were the stars. Mohamed El Shenawy, 36, was Al Ahly's savior as well.

The final result, however, was less important than the spectacle on opening night. FIFA president Gianni Infantino surely must have left the stadium smiling, but the Messi moment he hoped for, one that would have surely gone viral and positioned the Argentine as the face of the tournament, will have to wait. 

Until then, Miami is happy to be among the 32 participating clubs. That's their reality. 

“The fact that we're here in front of all of these fans in this stadium, in our city, and playing the opening game in the Club World Cup… it's an incredible position to be in,” Miami co-owner Sir David Beckham told tournament rights-holders DAZN before the match. 

“We're very proud of what we've done in the last five years. But this is the next step and it's a very exciting night for us, but it's not going to be an easy one. But we're ready.”

Kendry Paez has flown to the United States to train with Chelsea despite not being named in their Club World Cup squad, in a bid to impress Enzo Maresca. 

The expectation remains that Paez, the 18-year-old Ecuadorian described as a wonderkid, will leave on loan this summer. 

He was signed on a pre-agreement at the age of 16 for £17million, and Chelsea's sister club Strasbourg is his likeliest destination. 

While it is understood Paez's preference would be to be around Chelsea's first team over the next season, the club are considering what is best for his progress.

Andrey Santos has been used as an example over how a temporary stay at Strasbourg can benefit beneficial, with the 21-year-old Brazilian among those in their Club World Cup squad in the United States. 

Chelsea flew to Philadelphia on Friday to begin their prep for FIFA's expanded club competition. 

Their first game will be against Los Angeles FC in Atlanta on Monday when Liam Delap is expected to make his debut after signing from Ipswich for £30million. ","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","soccer"

Maresca added: ""It's not only exciting for my team, because they have the opportunity to face different teams, but also for my coaching staff and I to face other coaches and their coaching staff. 

""It will certainly be a learning curve, as well, because we'll learn many things. These countries and different cultures coming together will likely bring unique moments compared to those we would typically experience here in Europe.

The debate that roiled soccer fans for generations was also its most unanswerable: Which clubs, on which continents, played the best soccer? 

Unlike national teams that played one another in the quadrennial World Cup, there was rarely overlap between the top teams in Europe and South America, or North America, except for summertime “friendly” competitions. 

The FIFA Club World Cup, which begins this weekend across the U.S. and runs through the final on July 13, expanded its previously smaller format in an attempt to provide an answer. It now features 32 teams, from six continents, playing for a total prize money pool of $1 billion. 

“This is for bragging rights,” said Jill Ellis, the chief football officer of FIFA, soccer's global governing body, and a former World Cup-winning coach of the U.S. women's national team. “Prize money is a part of it. But most importantly, this is a chance to be the first-ever club world champion.”

As the tournament opens, however, the money is more than just a small part of it. Falling ticket prices, and accusations from Major League Soccer players that the league had agreed to participate in a “cash grab” that unfairly compensates them, have raised the question of just how much buy-in the new tournament has from U.S. audiences and players.

When tickets for Saturday's opening game in Florida between Inter Miami, featuring Lionel Messi, and Egyptian side Al Ahly went on sale in December through Ticketmaster, an upper-deck ticket cost $379 at the time. This week, similar ticket were on sale for as low as $116. According to NPR, FIFA has worked with a local Florida college to offer four complimentary tickets for students who pay for a single $20 ticket. Attendance for the opening game was announceed at 60,927, slightly shy of the stadium's capacity of 65,000.

Bayern Munich, the perennial German champion, listed lower-bowl tickets for its opener Sunday in Cincinnati for as low as $107 when its tickets went on sale in December; on Saturday, tickets were being resold on Stubhub for half that.

For as little as $8, fans can watch a June 25 game between the Japanese Urawa Red Diamonds and Mexican side C.F. Monterrey. 

""We anticipace great attendances and electric atmospheres at its inaugural edition, with excitement growing with every round of matches and the tournament ultimately standing as the undisputed pinnacle of club world football,"" FIFA said, in part of a statement sent to NBC News. ""The appetite speaks for itself: fans from over 130 countries have already purchased tickets. The top 10 markets are led by the United States, followed by Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Canada, France, Japan, Switzerland, Germany and Portugal — a clear sign of global anticipation and reach."" 

As a new tournament, the Club World Cup cannot offer much in the way of prestige or history. Instead, it has offered a historic amount of prize money, with $525 million of the total $1 billion distributed to teams on a sliding scale, guaranteed, just for making the 32-team field. At the top, brand-name European teams such as Real Madrid, Manchester City, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain will earn between $12.8 and $38 million; at the bottom, New Zealand's Auckland City FC will earn $3.5 million. 

The remaining $475 million of the billion-dollar pool will then be determined by teams' performances; making the round of 16 earns each club $7.5 million, with quarterfinalists $13.1 million, and increasing up to the final. The winner can ultimately rake in up to $125 million, all of which adds up to much more than bragging rights — which has left Major League Soccer players asking why their cut from the windfall isn't greater. 

Before a June 1 match players from the Seattle Sounders donned white T-shirts during warmups that read “Club World Ca$h Grab,” with an image of the Mr. Monopoly character wearing an “MLS” top hat and holding a pouch reading “FIFA.” The protest led the team's owner to berate players afterward, according to the Seattle Times. 

The three teams in the Club World Cup field from Major League Soccer — Seattle, Inter Miami and Los Angeles Football Club — are each guaranteed $9.55 million for participating, before any bonuses are earned for performance. Players' earnings from participation or performance in a “compulsory tournament or noncompulsory tournament” is capped at $1 million, per the terms of the league's collective bargaining agreement.

The players' union has continued to push publicly to increase' players stake from what is currently about a 90/10 split, and has noted that before a major tournament in 2024, the players and MLS renegotiated the prize money distribution before ultimately landing at a 50-50 split.

In a statement to NBC News on Thursday, MLS said that it has “agreed to voluntarily provide additional performance-based compensation to players from the three participating clubs.” That proposal, the league said, would allocate 20% of all prize money earned from the group stage onward to players. 

“If an MLS club wins the Club World Cup, its players would collectively receive more than $24 million in performance bonuses,” the statement read. “MLS club owners believe performance-based incentives are appropriate given the expanded format and increased prize pool for the Club World Cup. The League values the continued dedication and commitment of its players and looks forward to supporting them as they represent their clubs — and Major League Soccer — on the global stage this summer.”

On June 8, the players association posted on X that it was “deeply disappointed” by the league's proposal.

“The timing, substance and retaliatory nature of the proposal sends a clear message: MLS does not respect or value players' efforts with regard to this tournament,” the post read. “Although not surprised, the players and the MLSPA are deeply disappointed by this message.""

“I don't think sitting out is an option,” Seattle midfielder Albert Rusnak told reporters Friday. “Just because again, that inside what we have as athletes and winners and want to go out there and win and prove the people wrong whether we're talking about the bonuses or the people not believing we can do anything.”

Ellis, who works for FIFA, believes the prospect of playing on that global stage will lead to strong competition from players.

“I think the U.S. players, if you were to say to anyone, ‘Do you want to play in this tournament?' Sure, do they want to be paid as much as probably — I mean, that's within their own league and within the MLS to determine that, because obviously, unlike a lot of leagues around the world, MLS has a salary cap,” Ellis said. “So there's certain different structures and CBA, and so that's internal to that. 

“But I think in terms of what I and my experience in working with some of the best players in the world, elite players want to play against elite players. They want to test themselves, prove themselves, and they want to compete. ... Listen, at the end of the day it's a choice, but I think players will want to play in this event. 

“... In American sports when we win, when the Major League Baseball team wins, they're world champions. When the NFL team (wins) — the title is world champions. Well, yes, but they're playing against American teams. This is truly a world championship. This is the best clubs in the world.”

   08:26 EDT 15 Jun 2025, updated  11:59 EDT 15 Jun 2025    By ROBERT SUMMERSCALES  

FIFA's rebranded Club World Cup got underway in the United States on Saturday, but with fans expressing bafflement at the name of a new award.

Veteran goalkeeper Oscar Ustari was rewarded for his display in the 0-0 draw between Inter Miami and Egyptian side Al Ahly in the opening game.

The Inter Miami goalkeeper saved a penalty to keep Lionel Messi's side in the match.

Eagle-eyed viewers highlighted that Ustari was presented with the 'Superior Player of the Match' award, rather than the traditional man of the match prize.

The name raised plenty of eyebrows among fans who took to social media in disbelief, not just at the awkward phrasing, but what they saw as another example of football losing the plot.

'What on earth is a ""superior player of the match?""' one fan posted. Another simply wrote: 'Games gone, mate.'

A third X user fumed: 'Superior player of the match? You absolute sausages. Man of the match. End of!'

And a fourth branded it: 'Utter woke nonsense!'

Despite the outcry, the term is not actually the result of any recent shift in gendered language.

FIFA quietly phased out 'Man of the Match' from its international tournaments years ago. The 2022 World Cup in Qatar used the more neutral 'Player of the Match', following a similar move across many domestic leagues and competitions.

The 'Superior Player' element came as a result of one of the Club World Cup's sponsors, Michelob ULTRA.

The American beer brand carries the tagline 'Superior Light Beer'.

The branding was also used at the CONCACAF Champions Cup and Copa America — both held in the US — as part of the company's marketing drive.

Even so, some fans aren't having it. 'What the heck is ""superior player'.. good Lord… FIFA is ruining football,' grumbled one such fan on X.

Another crudely joked: 'Is this for dumb Americans to understand? Blimey.'

Although many fans took issue with the name of the award, few could argue against Miami keeper Ustari being a worthy recipient.

The 38-year-old made a total of eight saves, including one from Trezeguet's first-half penalty, to earn a valuable clean sheet.

Miami's next game is now against Porto on Tuesday, before they face Palmeiras four days later. ","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","soccer"

A largely incoherent Inter Miami was held to a scoreless draw by Al Ahly as the opening ceremony outshined the football on the pitch

Well, this was at least a first. Gianni was right on that front. On a clammy, boisterous, vaguely hallucinogenic night at the Hard Rock Stadium, the opening act of Fifa's billion-dollar death star, the newly bulked and tanned Club World Cup, did produce something new. This was surely the first major sporting event where the opening ceremony was infinitely more entertaining, and indeed comprehensible as a basic human activity, than the sporting spectacle that followed.

By the end, the best team in Africa, Al Ahly, had drawn 0-0 with a largely incoherent Inter Miami, who looked in the first half like they had a dim idea what this sport is meant to look like, but who were also struggling through a terrible wall-eyed hangover to remember which way is forward.

The second half was better, mainly because some element of the Lionel Messi identity began to assert itself, a muscle memory of genius, like watching the aged Frank Sinatra still tootling out That's Life on stage in Vegas, still drawing huge gales of applause for nodding a lot and pointing at the crowd.

This was the only significant emotion here: a deep sadness at seeing this spectacle play out, the post-Messi Messi, wheeled on to this stage of fakery, an instrument of sporting beauty weaponised in his dotage to promote a power grab.

And watching this you really got the scale of Fifa's act of deception, its betrayal of sport, the cynicism of its methods. Because everybody loves Messi, because there is a hard-wired emotional response, because you cannot resist. We will bolt the aged Messi to the front of our project, will play with your feelings, will in effect produce a targeted sporting crystal meth.

Actually that sounds a bit too exciting. The football here was largely abysmal. Does this matter? This thing isn't really built to be a robust sporting entity. It is simply product, an attempt to capture a global market. This is Fifa enabling the foreign policy aims of Saudi Arabia, sticking a flag in the middle of the world's greatest popular culture megaphone. It's the projection of a single random Swiss administrator.

Although, to be fair, lots of things that were supposed to be bad were actually fine here. The talk of half-empty stadiums always seemed a bit over the top. The Fifa marketing machine is a juggernaut. Americans are good at turning up to stuff. And mainly it was never going to be empty because Messi was here, Miami loves Messi, and America loves stars.

The Hard Rock is a castle-on-the-hill kind of structure, with its crisp, white, flying roof, dumped down in a vast expanse of shimmering tarmac. By the time the opening ceremonials came around the stands were pretty much full. The great Sir David appeared, looking graver now, hands folded like the fourth Earl of Sandwich, producing one of those expensive-looking regal waves, not really a wave at all, just a power-flex.

A DJ played club tunes, which was fun and infectious and gleefully received, not because of Fifa or football but because this is Miami and something about the air, the heat, the light, just makes this a place of fun and pleasure and show, and because Miami is full of beautiful glowing people who look like they're probably eternal.

The ceremony was good, not the stiff, mannered stuff these affairs often dish up, but loads of people dancing and playing horns and looking like they actually enjoy doing this. A terrifying horror movie-style voice shouted “take it to the worrrlllldd”, in a manner that suggested its owner was in the process of being expertly throttled.

Messi was last out on to the pitch. Everyone went predictably nuts, a shared static field of excitement, event glamour, the sense of being present at some kind of celebrity miracle.

He started in a non-position, just walking about vaguely, like a man having a stroll while listening to a podcast. Messi does, though, still have the shuffle the little switch, the groove, the music in his head. Watching him you got that feeling of a truly great footballer who can still see it all, but just can't call the shapes into being, Mozart with tinnitus, Hemingway staggering about the Florida Keys in his soggy late days, still feeling his own greatness, still the matador, even while he's sinking pisco sours in a crab shack

There was something frustrating and even slightly offensive about seeing Messi like this. It expresses perfectly the deeply manipulative nature of this event, of owners and political interests who will take that thing you love and use it to move the world around, who know you simply cannot resist. That thing that gives you pleasure and feels like freedom and joy? We will inject it into your eyes like a forced stimulant, a kind of footballing pornography.

Al Ahly should have scored at least twice in the opening 20 minutes. They missed a penalty. The YouTube overlord IShowSpeed appeared in the half-time break and prodded a ball toward the goal a few times, trailed by a man with a camera coiled into a furious crouch as though preserving the last recorded sighting of the snow leopard.

Messi woke up in the second half. Miami were better. They might have won, or at least scored. But a goalless draw felt right. The people in the stadium were the only winners here, in a city that just loves its nights.

Otherwise, Saturday in America was a day for a divisive, autocratic president to stage his own hugely overblown and narcissistic Grand Parade. It was in the end a pathetic spectacle and, in every sense of the word, the ghost of something great and pure and much-loved, out there being sold back to you like an empty replica shirt.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

    The German giant takes on Oceania's only representative in the tournament.
  

The FIFA Club World Cup action shifts to Cincinnati on Sunday for a Group C clash that appears to be something of a mismatch, as German Bundesliga behemoth Bayern Munich takes on tournament underdog Auckland City. 

Below, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to use to watch every match of the tournament as it happens, wherever you are in the world, and how to use a VPN if the match isn't available where you are, along with a full fixture list. 

Six-time UEFA Champions League winner Bayern comes into this tournament fresh from having clinched the German championship last month. With star man Harry Kane only just back from last week's international duty with England, veteran striker Thomas Müller looks set to deputise up front for the Bavarians, while key defender Alphonso Davies is set to miss the tournament with a knee injury.

Auckland's group of mainly part-time players, meanwhile, will be looking to pull off a major shock. The current OFC Champions League holder is seen as the weakest side in the tournament, but it comes into this game sitting in third in its domestic New Zealand National League and in reasonably good form, with three wins from its last four fixtures.

Bayern Munich take on Auckland City on Sunday, June 15, at TQL Stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio. Kickoff is set for 12 p.m. ET or 9 a.m. PT. That makes it a 5 p.m. BST start in the UK and a 2 a.m. AEST kickoff in Australia on Monday. 

Thomas Muller is set to lead the line for Bayern Munich today in what is set to be the 35-year-old's final tournament.

The great news for footy fans is that sports streaming platform DAZN is set to broadcast all 63 matches of the FIFA Club World Cup free in almost every country, with coverage available in multiple languages.

Existing DAZN subscribers or Freemium members can watch every game of the tournament as part of their current membership.

If you're not a member, it's easy to sign up for a free DAZN Freemium account using your email address to watch all the action at no cost through the DAZN app.

As well as dedicated apps for iOS and Android, DAZN offers a wide range of support for set-top boxes and smart TVs.

If you're traveling abroad and want to keep up with all the FIFA Club World Cup soccer action while away from home, a VPN can help enhance your privacy and security when streaming. 

It encrypts your traffic and prevents your internet service provider from throttling your speeds and can also be helpful when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks while traveling, adding an extra layer of protection for your devices and logins. VPNs are legal in many countries, including the US and Canada, and can be used for legitimate purposes such as improving online privacy and security. 

However, some streaming services may have policies restricting VPN use to access region-specific content. If you're considering a VPN for streaming, check the platform's terms of service to ensure compliance. 

If you choose to use a VPN, follow the provider's installation instructions, ensuring you're connected securely and in compliance with applicable laws and service agreements. Some streaming platforms may block access when a VPN is detected, so verifying if your streaming subscription allows VPN use is crucial.

ExpressVPN is our current best VPN pick for people who want a reliable and safe VPN and it works on a variety of devices. It's normally $13 a month but if you sign up for an annual subscription for $100 you'll get three months free and save 49%. That's the equivalent of $6.67 a month.

Note that ExpressVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee.

As well as DAZN, footy fans in the UK have a second option for watching FIFA Club World Cup matches that is also free.

Free-to-air broadcaster Channel 5 will show 23 select features live during the tournament, including today's tournament opener. 

That also means this match can be livestreamed via the network's My5 online service. Coverage begins at 4 p.m. BST. 

Channel 5 is available through Freeview, Freesat, Freely, Sky or Virgin Media.

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. – Inter Miami CF settled for a 0-0 draw with Egyptian side Al Ahly Saturday night in their 2025 FIFA Club World Cup debut at Hard Rock Stadium.

Óscar Ustari's lights-out performance in goal gave the Herons a point in their Group A opener, which was also the tournament's inaugural match.

The veteran Argentine goalkeeper made eight saves on the night, withstanding a barrage of pressure through most of the first half with several highlight-reel interventions – none more vital than a 43rd-minute penalty-kick stop on Trézéguet.

Ustari's heroics gave the Herons a second wind in the final 45 minutes, with Lionel Messi flashing a free kick against the side netting and substitute Fafà Picault forcing a close-range stop from Al Ahly 'keeper Mohamed El Shenawy late in the game.

El Shenawy had one more game-saving denial in him, deflecting a Messi shot over the crossbar deep into stoppage time to secure the scoreless draw.

FIFA Club World Cup

Follow live coverage of Paris Saint-Germain vs Atletico Madrid and Bayern Munich vs Auckland City at the Club World Cup today

Last summer, as FIFA attempted to set the wheels in motion for the revamped 32-team Club World Cup in the United States, disagreement surfaced within the organization.

According to multiple sources familiar with the discussions, all of whom wished to remain anonymous to protect their working relationships, FIFA staff based in Miami wanted the tournament to lean more heavily on smaller MLS stadiums, particularly for games that may involve teams who are unfamiliar to the U.S. market. Their thesis was that hot-ticket events could boost revenues, while FIFA would also avoid empty seats in the first edition of a remodelled tournament.

Yet the message from senior officials in FIFA's European office, led by the organization's president Gianni Infantino, was clear. They wanted this tournament to be the biggest and the best. Infantino has described it as “a big bang” and the “most coveted” competition in world club football.

In the White House, standing next to the sitting President Donald Trump in the Oval Office, Infantino described the Club World Cup as the “best players from the best teams” and he said “millions of people will be coming”. He even ensured his own name was inscribed — in more than one place — on a trophy designed by Tiffany & Co; the brand was recommended by Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

Infantino told confidantes he wanted the prize money to be the biggest for any tournament in club football. He fell narrowly short — the winner of the Club World Cup, according to figures published by FIFA, may earn up to $125m (£93.5m), which is less than the $154m Real Madrid earned by winning the Champions League in 2024.

His ambition was reflected with the choice of stadiums, as eight of the 12 venues have capacities in excess of 65,000 and only 12 of the 64 games will be played in MLS-dedicated venues — in Nashville, Cincinnati, Orlando and Washington, D.C.

This leaves modest fixtures in huge stadiums; Brazilian team Fluminense against South African side Mamelodi Sundowns in Hard Rock Stadium (65,000 capacity); Fluminense and Korea's Ulsan HD at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey (82,500 capacity); and Brazilian side Flamengo against the Tunisian team Esperance de Tunis at Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field (69,000 capacity). As of last week, the Sundowns' match against Fluminense had sold less than 10,000 tickets, and even games involving Inter Milan and Paris Saint-Germain in Pasadena and Seattle are likely to fall way short of selling out.

At this point, we should remember tournaments do not always sell out, even in football markets often considered more mature. Amid the nostalgic folklore of the European Championship held in England in 1996, which is often framed as the summer when “football came home,” attendances were actually rather modest.

Spain's opening match against Bulgaria attracted 26,000 at Leeds United's Elland Road. Five group-stage games had crowds of less than 20,000. There were tens of thousands of empty seats at Manchester United's Old Trafford for the semi-final between the Czech Republic and France. There were plenty of reasons for this; ticket prices were considered high, while the average British football fan may have been less curious about foreign teams in the 1990s than they are today, and an IRA bomb early in the tournament in Manchester city centre also may have dissuaded people away from public spaces — although some of the early group games with low attendances preceded the attack. A quick search of “empty seats” on Google also reveals discussions on the topic during the World Cup in Qatar in 2022, Brazil in 2014 and Japan and South Korea in 2002, although this was more due to no-shows and ticketing issues than a lack of demand.

The sight of empty seats for the Club World Cup will lead to plenty of scorn, and probably plenty of memes. There are worries among some figures involved with host-city planning for next year's World Cup in the U.S. that empty seats at the Club World Cup will undermine the story they seek to tell of soccer being on the brink of exploding across the country. Some worry that it may impact their pitches to potential sponsors of fan festivals around the World Cup. In short, there is a danger the Club World Cup will be seen as the latest referendum on America's appetite for the sport, but such conclusions should come with caution, and there are plenty of reasons why American fans may be sceptical of spending big on these games.

Any post-mortem should focus more heavily on the supply (FIFA) rather than the demand (soccer fans in the U.S.). Many factors combined to create a tournament that has been struggling for positive publicity outside of the quotes largely published as press releases by either competing clubs or FIFA.

Firstly, FIFA set expectations and prices for the competition at a level that were wildly out of kilter for the product. FIFA's tournament slogan of “the best against the best” is immediately undermined by the fact the current champions of England, Spain and Italy are not involved, owing to the qualification format FIFA laid out.

FIFA's chances of maximizing success were also hindered by arriving late into the planning and organization of the tournament. This is not something the U.S. bid for — they were simply told Infantino was bringing the competition to their country. This is why FIFA was left with so little leverage when securing venues for the tournament, paying high rental fees that nearly guarantee stadiums will receive healthy profits regardless of ticket sales. FIFA says venues were offered incentives via commissions on further ticket sales if they connected the stadium's “legacy fans” with tickets.

Yet FIFA did not have venues secured until last autumn, while sponsors also arrived late in the day — at lower rates than the governing body first imagined when conceptualizing the tournament. A broadcaster, DAZN, was announced as a $1billion partner in December. This was before the streaming platform received around the same amount in funding from Saudi Arabia, but this fell billions short of Infantino's original hopes for the competition's TV deal. In the weeks before striking the DAZN deal, which also secured the participation and prize money for competing teams, several European clubs were privately considering walking away from the competition.

As for the appetite of the U.S. public, FIFA presumed it was onto a winner in a country where tickets for major sports events sell and resell into many hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars. The problem this time, however, is few people across the world appeared to fully understand the event, which has also been the subject of criticism and lawsuits from bodies such as the Premier League, La Liga and world players' union FIFPro, who have expressed concerns about a cluttered football calendar or players being overworked.

FIFA set expensive ticket prices for teams who are, to put it mildly, new to the U.S. market. Some games are scheduled for weekday afternoons, which can be inconvenient both for those who work but also due to the summer heat. There are exceptions, notably games involving Argentina's Boca Juniors in Miami, or Real Madrid anywhere at all, while a match between PSG and Atletico Madrid in the group stage at the Rose Bowl is selling better since the French team won the Champions League, but will still fall short of a sell-out. Infantino's claims about millions of visitors also appear highly unlikely, while some domestic fans have been concerned by reports of government immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) agents being present at games amid the Trump administration's rhetoric on immigration. ICE told NBC that “all non-American citizens need to carry proof of their legal status.”

The Athletic has reported how, as of two weeks before the tournament, tens of thousands of seats remained unsold at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens to host Lionel Messi's Inter Miami against Egyptian team Al-Ahly. FIFA has offered students of Miami Dade College (which has over 100,000 enrolled) the opportunity to buy tickets for $20, with up to four complimentary tickets. This means some fans will be watching Messi for as little as $4, which is a far cry from the cheapest seats being cast at $349 when the draw was made in December. Elsewhere, FIFA has been quietly sending partial refunds to some supporters who bought tickets at higher prices through their club team allocations when they first became available, while other games are also braced for either low attendances or late giveaways to avoid vast sections of empty seats.

To fill the stadiums, the dynamically priced market may work in favor of consumers, driving prices down where supply is low. There has been a substantial increase in ticket sales over the past fortnight, and there is also hope that once the tournament starts — and established European teams with large followings advance to the final rounds — both interest and demand will follow. By the end, this first edition may even start to look like a roaring success after a false start.

Speaking this week, Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey said his “guess” was that MetLife Stadium would have between 40,000 and 50,000 for their first game this weekend between Portuguese side Porto and Brazilian team Palmeiras. While this would leave at least 30,000 empty seats, it would also, in most settings, be a pretty impressive attendance for a game between two teams who are not hugely familiar to an American audience in an unproven tournament. It is hard to imagine, for example, the attendance being any higher if the same game were played in England.

In FIFA HQ, there have been strategic mistakes. FIFA presumed a home market would turn out for Inter Miami, but locals did not want to stump up significantly more than they usually do to watch Messi regularly in MLS. It would have been smarter to take Messi on tour, hitting different markets where he appears less regularly. The late inclusion of MLS side LAFC — owing to the expulsion of Mexican team Leon — meant games involving LAFC could not be played in Los Angeles, where the team is well-supported in their local market, as the calendar was already set.

FIFA is also operating in a market that is saturated. Other soccer is available this summer in the U.S., notably the Gold Cup, which will include the U.S. men's national team and a full-strength Mexico. FIFA also managed to irritate Concacaf, which hoped to have the southern portion of the west coast largely to themselves for the Gold Cup, only for FIFA to then strike a deal to play games at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. The Premier League will also bring Manchester United to New Jersey, Atlanta and Chicago this summer as part of its Summer Series, while many fans may be saving up for FIFA's own World Cup next summer, particularly since The Athletic recently revealed the tournament will also be dynamically priced.

Some humility, therefore, may have been in order this summer for FIFA, which had an opportunity to develop goodwill and excitement ahead of the World Cup. FIFA, which projects $13bn of revenue during the cycle leading through next year's tournament, might have used this as a chance to recognize the sport is still emerging and offer a wider selection of truly affordable tickets from the outset. Those same supporters who benefited this summer may then have been inspired to either save up for next summer or spend money around fan festivals at the World Cup. Instead, the tickets only became affordable when the organization's president was at risk of being embarrassed by attendances.

FIFA's attempts to capture the imagination of the U.S. market have been increasingly frantic. Infantino has been touring the U.S., but some clubs wonder whether the divisive FIFA president is the best salesman for the tournament.

As part of his recent attempts to charm a younger audience, he visited the influencer iShowSpeed in late May, when he claimed Cristiano Ronaldo was talking to participating clubs about a transfer that would enable him to compete in the tournament. No move materialized, and Ronaldo's representatives were irritated by Infantino's comments.

A spokesperson representing the influencer told The Athletic no payment was offered or received in either direction for Infantino to appear on Speed's stream.

FIFA has engaged numerous American influencers to promote the tournament, an apparent attempt at connecting with the most casual of soccer fans. They have hired Shayne Boyle, who appears to be most famous for catching items in his mouth on an Instagram account called insaneshayne1 followed by 2.9 million people, as well as food content creator meals_by_cug, the innovation creator unnecessaryinventions and the baseball video creator Kait Maniscalco (askkait).

The coming weeks will tell us whether FIFA's strategy has paid dividends.

American alpine ski racer Lindsey Vonn shared a sarcastic reaction to current ATP No. 1 Jannik Sinner appearing to be shocked to the questions being thrown at him in German before the start of the Halle Open 2025. The Italian will be in action on Monday, June 16, during the tournament.

Sinner will be teaming up with his compatriot, Lorenzo Sonego, to face the pair of Alex Michelsen and Karen Khachanov in the Round of 16 stage. Just a couple of days before the start of Sinner's exploits in the tournament, he sat down for an interview, during which the interviewer asked him questions in German.

Shocked by the questions, the Italian carefully listened to the questions and came up with a sarcastic reaction. Sinner said:

Lindsey Vonn reacted to this part of the interview on Instagram and dropped a few laughing emojis in the comments section.

Lindsey Vonn has been an admirer of Jannik Sinner for the last few years. The veteran ski racer is seen occasionally praising the Italian for his qualities on and off the court.

Jannik Sinner made his feelings known on his emotions after defeat to Carlos Alcaraz in the finals of the 2025 Roland Garros. The Italian started well, winning the first two sets with ease, but the Spaniard turned the match on his head to win the next three and defend his title successfully.

Notably, this was Sinner's second straight tournament finals loss to Alcaraz after the Italian Open in May. Sinner shared that he faced several sleepless nights after this defeat, and moving to a new tournament (Halle Open 2025) has been a positive for him. He said (via ATP Tour):

During the conversation, Sinner also mentioned the upcoming grass court season, stating that he uplifted his performance last year and is looking what this year has in store for him.

‘S-HERTOGENBOSCH - Gabriel Diallo has won his first ATP Tour title.

‘S-HERTOGENBOSCH - Gabriel Diallo has won his first ATP Tour title.

The 23-year-old Montreal native defeated Belgium's Zizou Bergs 7-5, 7-6 (8) to win the Libema Open tennis tournament on Sunday.

In what was a tight, back-and-forth second set, Diallo was down 6-4 in the tiebreaker before pulling victory from the jaws of defeat. He got three straight points from then on before eventually taking the win.

“Oh man, I don't have the words. It's something that you dream of for your whole life since you were a little kid, to get an ATP Tour title,” Diallo said in his on-court interview. “The fact that I was able to do it here after losing a final last year, it just means the world to me. 

“I'm very happy, not only for myself but for my whole team.”

Diallo had nine aces, won 76 per cent of his first-serve points and had 23 winners. He also broke on his lone opportunity, while saving his opponent's two break point chances.

The six-foot-eight Diallo was the first Canadian men's singles finalist in event history. He is also just the fourth Canadian to win an ATP Tour singles title this century after Milos Raonic (eight titles), Felix Auger-Aliassime (seven titles) and Denis Shapovalov (three titles).

Diallo will rise 11 spots to a career-high No. 44 in the ATP rankings on Monday. He already guaranteed his top-50 debut by reaching the semifinals.

‘s-HERTOGENBOSCH, the Netherlands– Former Kentucky men's tennis great Gabriel Diallo claimed his first career ATP Tour title on Sunday, defeating Belgium's Zizou Bergs in the final of the ATP 250 Libema Open Grass Count Championships in ‘s-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands by a 7-5, 7-6(8) scoreline. The 23-year-old Canadian will now debut in the top 50 of the ATP Rankings for the first time in his career on Monday, rising to a career-high mark of No. 44.

The three-time All-American, who played in Lexington from 2020-2022, saved two match points in his second round contest against Jordan Thompson and knocked out two top 25 players in No. 24 Karen Khachanov (quarterfinals) and No. 20 Ugo Humbert (semifinals) en route to the title. In total, Diallo only dropped one set in the tournament and held serve in all but two games across the five rounds.

Competing in his second career tour-level final, Diallo was able to claim his maiden title on the backs of his big serving and performance in pressure points. In Sunday's final, Diallo and Bergs easily held serve for the first ten games until the Canadian was the first to face break points, trailing 15-40 at 5-5. Diallo was able to rebound and save Bergs' only two chances at a break in the match to take the 6-5, following the clutch hold with an immediate break of Bergs to claim the opening set. In the second frame, neither player faced a break point and the set went to a tiebreak, where Diallo was once again able to clutch up and save a pair of set points before ultimately claiming the trophy with a backhand crosscourt winner after an extended rally.

Diallo, who did not own a tour-level win on grass before this week, became the first Canadian in the 21st century to claim a tour-level title on grass. A rising star since his run to the third round of the 2024 US Open as a qualifier, Diallo has steadily improved his reputation, owning a 3-1 record against top 20 opponents in 2025. Other highlights of the Canadian's year include opening round wins at the Australian Open and Roland Garros and a maiden Masters 1000 quarterfinal appearance at the Madrid Open.

Diallo is currently scheduled to continue his grass season at the Queen's Club in London this week in leadup to The Championships, Wimbledon that will begin on June 30.

Taylor Fritz captured his fourth ATP Tour title on grass and ninth overall on Sunday at the BOSS OPEN in Stuttgart, where he defeated World No. 3 Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6(0).

In a rain-disrupted final, Fritz produced an impressive performance on serve to maintain his dominant recent record against Zverev. The American fired 11 aces, did not face a break point and won 88 per cent of his first-serve points to improve to 8-5 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series against the German.

Fritz, who has now won his past five meetings against Zverev, will return to No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings following his triumph. The American displaces British lefty Jack Draper, who had dislodged Fritz in fourth spot last Monday.

""It was not so great a clay season, so to come here and start the grass season off perfectly, I am super happy to get the title and to do it here,"" Fritz said.

He is SO back 🙌@Taylor_Fritz97 | @boss__open | #BossOpen pic.twitter.com/znvWcYLF8C

Fritz did not drop a set all week at the ATP 250 event in Germany and is the first player to lift a tour-level trophy without losing serve since Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard in Basel last October.

Among active players, only Novak Djokovic has more grass-court titles (8) than Taylor Fritz. The American has claimed four, including three at Eastbourne, putting him level alongside Matteo Berrettini and Nicolas Mahut.

Fritz arrived in Stuttgart seeking form, having suffered a shock opening-round exit against Daniel Altmaier at Roland Garros. The second seed looked comfortable all week in Germany and was in control for large periods against Zverev.

The American rushed the German with his depth and aggressive forehand in the opening set, clinching the decisive break in the eighth game before holding serve to lead. Rain suspended play for 65 minutes at the start of the second set and when they returned, there was little between the Top 10 stars. With a tie-break left to decide the set, Fritz fired three winners and benefited from Zverev errors to capture his first title of the season.

Aryna Sabalenka may have come up agonisingly short in the French Open final but the 27-year-old appeared to be unfazed as she enjoyed a holiday with her boyfriend in Mykonos. 

Coco Gauff got the better of the Belarusian at Roland Garros but Sabalenka put her disappointment behind her with a pre-Wimbledon getaway on the Greek island.

Sabalenka took to Instagram to share a series of photos of herself and Georgios Frangulis enjoying their break.

The tennis star has been with the Oakberry founder and racecar driver Frangulis since early 2024.

Sabalenka's rise to the world No1 ranking came despite tragedy last year when her ex-boyfriend Konstantin Koltsov tragically died of a reported suicide after jumping from a hotel balcony in Miami.

Former NHL player and fellow Belarusian Konstantin Koltsov died at the age of 42 after falling from a balcony on the 23rd floor of a Miami five-star hotel.

Sabalenka had revealed her plans to enjoy 'sugar and alcohol' in Mykonos in the aftermath of her 6-7, 6-2, 6-4 loss to Gauff in one of the great women's finals of the decade.

‘I already have a flight booked to Mykonos and alcohol, sugar. I just need couple of days to completely forget about this crazy world and this crazy, if I could swear, I would swear right now, but this crazy thing that happened today,' Sabalenka said post-match.

‘I think everyone understands. I'm just trying to be very polite right now, but there is no other word that could describe what just happened today on the court.

‘Tequila, gummy bears and swimming, being like a tourist for a couple of days.'

This marked the second Grand Slam of Gauff's career, having also claimed the 2023 US Open title. The world No 2 became the first American to win the French Open since Serena Williams in 2015.

In an press-conference after the final, Sabalenka argued that the three-time defending champion Iga Swiatek would have beaten Gauff had beaten her in their semi-final.

Sabalenka said: 'That hurts. Especially when I've been playing really great tennis during the whole week. A lot of tough opponents, Iga.

'I think if Iga would have beaten me, she would go out today and she would get the win.'

The couple looked to have had a special time despite the disappointment of the French Open

The star shared photos from the beach and of her drinking wine as she enjoyed the pre-Wimbledon break after she vowed to enjoy 'sugar and alcohol' after the French Open final

Gauff parried the claim away and cited her victory in straight sets against Swiatek at the Madrid Open earlier this year, which was also on clay.

Gauff rebutted: 'I mean, I don't agree with that. I'm here sitting here (with the trophy). Last time I played - no shade to Iga or anything, but I played her and I won in straight sets (in Madrid).

'I don't think that's a fair thing to say, because anything can happen. The way Aryna was playing the last few weeks, she was the favourite to win the title. If you asked me, honestly, who I wanted to play, it was Iga just because I felt Aryna was playing so good, and she was.

'But regardless of who I played, I think I had a good shot to win. I definitely had that belief.'

Sabalenka made 70 unforced errors in blustery conditions, and said: 'It felt like a joke. Like somebody from above was laughing: let's see if you can handle this.

'After two weeks of incredible tennis, in the final in terrible conditions to play such terrible tennis really hurts.

'It felt like she (Gauff) was hitting the ball off the frame and somehow magically it lands in the court. I don't think she won the match because she played incredible, just because I made all those mistakes.'

Coco Gauff got the better of the Belarusian at Roland Garros in an epic encounter

Sabalenka's break from the court comes ahead of Wimbledon, where the world No1 will start as pre-tournament favourite as she bids to triumph at the All-England Club for the first time in her career.

She was forced to pull out of last year's tournament through injury and was blocked from entering in 2022 due to a ban on Russian and Belarusian players amid the war in Ukraine.

Sabalenka, however, has reached the semi-finals on her last two appearances at Wimbledon in 2021 and 2023.

She will look to hone her preparations following the break by playing at the Berlin Open, a grass court tournament, this week.

Naomi Osaka's coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, expressed his feelings on Novak Djokovic's current form and why he thinks the Serb struggled to fare well against Jannik Sinner in the semifinals of the French Open. He believed that his loss was not due to his physical incapability, but rather due to a lack of mental edge against Sinner.

The Italian defeated the 24-time Grand Slam champion in straight sets, after the Serb had put up commanding performances in the earlier rounds of the tournament. However, Mouratoglou believes that the only setback in that match for the Serb was his mentality, which made him lose his drive to win.

In a video posted on Instagram, the acclaimed tennis coach explained the reason for his statement in detail, claiming that Djokovic lacked character in the match. He said:

He also cited the reason that might have brought about this possible change in the tennis star, stemming from his former rivalries with Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer.

Novak Djokovic himself admitted that this could be his last French Open.

As Novak Djokovic was seen kissing the clay court and bidding an emotional adieu to the Court Philippe Chatrier after his loss to Jannik Sinner, fans speculated about his future. He addressed the topic during his post-match press conference and said:

Even though the tennis star hasn't yet confirmed his participation in Wimbledon, he will hopefully be in action in the quest for his 25th major title.

World No. 1 Jannik Sinner hopes to rebound from his heartbreaking French Open final loss to Carlos Alcaraz and a string of sleepless nights by making a strong showing at the Halle Open.

In a thrilling showdown, Sinner took the first two sets and had three match points in the fourth set, but Spaniard Alcaraz persevered to grind out a 4-6, 6-7(4), 6-4, 7-6(3), 7-6(10-2) win in 5 hours and 29 minutes – the longest final at Roland Garros.




Asked if he had thought about the championship points he failed to convert, Sinner told reporters on Saturday: ""Often. It happens. I don't know how it will look in the future.

""I think that it is not the most important thing, but I nevertheless try to forget the negative things and see what I can do here,"" in Halle.




""I think that for me to play another tournament is positive, because every match is a new beginning, and I must be mentally ready to give my all on the court. Therefore, it is great I can be here in Halle. Yes, I had already a few sleepless nights, but I think every day it gets better.""

The 23-year-old Italian is the reigning champion at Halle and will seek to defend his crown at the tournament, which starts Monday, as he gears up for Wimbledon, which will be held from June 30 to July 13 at the All England Lawn Tennis Club.

""The first practice session was OK. I hadn't played since Paris, so my general feelings on the court were not so perfect,"" Sinner said.

""I think a good grass-court player can move well. The ball can bounce a bit funny because of the grass, and you have to serve intelligently.




""But in general, it is a surface on which I took a step forward last year and we will see how it goes this year.""","{'href': 'https://www.dailysabah.com', 'title': 'Daily Sabah'}","tennis"

Jannik Sinner of Italy

Redacción

USA

Just a week after the dramatic Roland Garros final, Jannik Sinner appears to have moved on from the disappointment in Paris and is already looking ahead to new goals—chiefly, Wimbledon. 

Before that, however, he will defend his title at the ATP 500 tournament in Halle, Germany, where he triumphed last season.

Jannik Sinner of Italy

The Italian, hailing from San Candido, is embracing a philosophical outlook to process the heartbreaking loss at Roland Garros, where he held a two-set lead and had three match points before ultimately falling to Carlos Alcaraz.

Still, Sinner remains focused on the positives from the experience in Paris. ""Roland Garros didn't end the way I would've liked, but there are reasons to be satisfied,"" he said.

""It's a matter of perspective. You can dwell on the three match points I missed, or you can see it as the best clay-court match I've ever played. Carlos Alcaraz is a very strong player after all,"" explained the world No. 1.

""I played five hours without any physical issues,"" Sinner emphasized. Since the final, he's taken time off to recover and recharge before resuming competition in Halle. Throughout the past week, he made a conscious effort to unplug.

""I spent a few days with friends and family. I enjoyed myself and had fun doing simple things. For me, it's important to find time for normal moments. I'm fortunate to be surrounded by people who love and care about me,"" he added.

Sinner will begin his title defense in Halle this coming Tuesday, although he will get his first taste of grass on Sunday, partnering with Lorenzo Sonego in doubles.

The world No. 1 will open against a qualifier and could potentially face past champions later in the draw. Notably, he may meet Kazakhstan's Alexander Bublik—2022 champion—in the second round, and Poland's Hubert Hurkacz—2021 winner—in the quarterfinals.

Looking further ahead to the semifinals, Sinner could be challenged by top-tier competitors such as Russians Andrey Rublev and Karen Khachanov, or Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime.

On the opposite half of the Halle draw is second seed Alexander Zverev, a finalist in 2016 and 2017. 

He begins his campaign against American Marcos Giron and could later face former Halle champion Ugo Humbert, who opens against Canada's Denis Shapovalov.

Also competing in Zverev's section are Italy's Lorenzo Sonego, Germany's Jan-Lennard Struff, breakout Brazilian star Joao Fonseca, and top names like Russia's Daniil Medvedev and Greece's Stefanos Tsitsipas—who is starting a new chapter under coach Goran Ivanisevic.

Jannik Sinner admitted he has had ""sleepless nights"" since losing the French Open final to Carlos Alcaraz in five thrilling sets last week. 

While speaking to reporters in German at his pre-tournament press conference ahead of the Terra Wortman Open, Sinner spoke about both the positives and negatives of dealing with the agonizing loss. 

""I think that for me to play another tournament is positive, because every match is a new beginning, and I must be mentally ready to give my all on the court,"" Sinner said according to the ATP Tour's website. ""Therefore, it is great I can be here in Halle. But yes, I had already a few sleepless nights, but I think every day it gets better.

""My family stand behind me, and my friends. That is the most important thing for me. Tennis is important in my life but nevertheless are family and friends more important. Nonetheless I think often about the match.""

Sinner won the first two sets of the match, then earned a quick break of Alcaraz's serve to begin the third set. But the Spaniard, who had never completed a comeback from two sets down in his career before his thrilling victory in the Roland Garros final, fought back and saved three consecutive championship points en route to winning the match in improbable fashion. 

Not only did Sinner thrice lose out on an opportunity to secure the Musketeers' Cup, but he also won one more point than Alcaraz in the entire match, showcasing both how close he came and, yet, how gut-wrenching the defeat was. 

""I still think about those couple of points"" 💔@janniksin on *that* Roland-Garros final vs Alcaraz#TWO25 pic.twitter.com/u3ZOFfBE1C

While Sinner admitted he still thinks about those ""couple of points,"" he also took some positives from the loss, namely that he had ""never played tennis on clay like this."" It's worth noting that Sinner reached this level of play in just his second tournament since returning from a three-month doping suspension. 

He'll now turn his attention to the grass courts in Halle and then the iconic All-England Club for Wimbledon in just two weeks' time.

Tatjana Maria knocked off four Top 20 players in a row to capture her first WTA 500 title at the HSBC Championships. She becomes the oldest titlist on tour since Serena Williams in 2020.

Thanks to four Top 20 wins in a row, Tatjana Maria has been rewarded with her biggest career title -- as a 37-year-old mother of two.

Queen's Club: Draws | Scores | Order of play

Capping off her incredible week of upsets, German qualifier Maria captured the WTA 500 HSBC Championships title on Sunday with a 6-3, 6-4 final victory over No. 8 seed Amanda Anisimova of the United States.

""It means a lot to me, because I'm 37 years old and I won this trophy today,"" Maria told the press. ""People were always saying, 'Oh, now maybe it's time. You are too old. You are...' Whatever reason they say sometimes. 

""I'm a good example that even in my age you still can win big trophies. I'm super proud of myself that I could win this tournament, because actually, I believed always in it, and my husband too. That's why we kept also going, because there was always this belief that I can win big tournaments and that I can do great things on the court.""

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

Family affair: In their only previous meeting, Maria had beaten Anisimova in Beijing qualifying back in 2018. All these years later, the World No.86 defeated her again with her slice-and-dice game, carving her way to a win after 1 hour and 23 minutes of play.

With her daughters 11-year-old Charlotte and 4-year-old Cecilia joining husband/coach Charles in the front row of the stands, Maria became the oldest singles champion on the Hologic WTA Tour since another returning mother, Serena Williams, won the 2020 Auckland title aged 38.

""It's such a special moment for all of us, like a family together,"" Maria said. ""We won this trophy together, because we stick together and we are doing everything together. So it's not like only me that I won this trophy today. It's like my whole family won this trophy.""

Happy return: It is fitting that a veteran player won the title here, given that this was the first time since 1973 that WTA tennis has been contested at the prestigious Queen's Club in London. 52 years after Olga Morozova won the most recent Queen's Club WTA title, Maria follows her on the championship trophy.

With the win, Maria maintained her undefeated record in WTA singles finals, improving to 4-0 when a title is on the line. The German won her first WTA title on grass at Mallorca in 2018, and then she became a Bogota expert, winning that clay-court event back-to-back in 2022 and 2023.

Sunday, though, marked Maria's first career final above WTA 250-level. The step up in level did not faze her, and after beating Top 20 players Karolina Muchova, Elena Rybakina and Madison Keys consecutively to make the championship match, Maria completed her quartet of high-caliber wins with one final triumph.

The only other time Maria had defeated multiple Top 20 players at a single event was during one of her other spectacular grass-court runs -- she ousted Maria Sakkari and Jelena Ostapenko en route to the 2022 Wimbledon semifinals. And, in fact, those were her most recent Top 20 wins until this week.

""In [2022] when I played Wimbledon, I mean, I was fighting for every point, but there were sometimes like a few doubts,"" Maria said. ""This week, actually, I really found my confidence. I was believing in myself from the first till the last point that I could win this. Every single match, actually.""

Tale of the tape: Ranked at a new career-high of World No. 15, Anisimova also had a wonderful week, besting Top 10 players Emma Navarro and Zheng Qinwen back-to-back in the last two rounds. It was the first time Anisimova had advanced beyond the quarterfinals of a grass-court WTA event.

But Maria's combo of slices, speed and big serves had proved too strong on the grass this week for every player she faced, and Anisimova was no exception. At one point, Maria won 12 points in a row during her run to a 4-1 lead in Sunday's first set.

Anisimova cranked a rally backhand winner to pull back on serve at 4-3, but Maria refused to yield the momentum, scampering all over the court to win the next two games and clinch the one-set lead. Even with her unorthodox shots, Maria hit only three unforced errors in the first set.

In the second set, Maria raced out to a 4-1 lead again. The German's seventh ace of the day gave her a 5-3 lead, and she served out the match two games later to attain victory.

Muhammad, Schuurs win doubles title: The Queen's Club doubles final followed on Andy Murray Arena, and No. 4 seeds Asia Muhammad and Demi Schuurs squeaked past No. 2 seeds Anna Danilina and Diana Shnaider 7-5, 6-7(3), [10-4] to take the title.

Muhammad and Schuurs were unable to convert two championship points in the second set, but the American-Dutch duo took command in the decisive match-tiebreak to claim victory after 1 hour and 44 minutes.

It's another big title this year for Muhammad and Schuurs, who won WTA 1000 Indian Wells in March. This is Muhammad's 13th career WTA doubles title, and Schuurs' 21st.

Tatjana Maria knocked off four Top 20 players in a row to capture her first WTA 500 title at the HSBC Championships. She becomes the oldest titlist on tour since Serena Williams in 2020.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

Annabel Croft, one time girls' Wimbledon winner, tennis commentator, pundit and Strictly semi-finalist, recently found a piece of English homework from when she was eleven in 1978. It was entitled “What I Would Like to Do”.

She had picked up a tennis racket only two years earlier, during a family holiday in Spain. In the ensuing decade, little did she know that she would become Britain's brightest young female tennis star. “I would like to be able to… win Wimbledon,” she wrote. “Before I get to [sic] old, I would like to dance on stage… before I am to [sic] old I would like to get married because if you are too [sic] old you cannot have children… Also, your husband protects you.”

This afternoon, we are sitting at the kitchen island in Croft's six-bedroom neo-classical home, designed by her late husband Mel Coleman twenty five years ago. The house, part of a gated estate in Kingston, is a short drive away from the grass courts of Wimbledon. When Croft was selected for the main draw there at the age of 15, she was the youngest to play there for 95 years. In 1984, a month before her 18th birthday, she won the girls' junior title.

It's hard to square that Croft is now 58-years-old – 59 next month. She doesn't look that different from the press cuttings of thirty-five years ago, which are stacked up in the hallway as she prepares for a 28-date speaking tour about her life this September.

She does a lot of walking and yoga these days, as well as playing tennis – and it shows. Wearing a Me+Em brown linen jumpsuit and mules, she has a baked-in tan (she founded her Annabel Croft academy in Portugal, which Coleman oversaw until he died two years ago). Her famous mane of hair, always tied back in a high pony or plait when she was the Raducanu of her day, now cascades around her shoulders.

The French Open is on in the background. “That was incredible,” she says after Aryna Sabalenka catches out Coco Gauff, before the ultimate glory was claimed by Gauff, who Croft is rooting for to win Wimbledon.

Croft spent the first ten days of this year's Roland Garros commentating for BBC Radio Five Live. Tomorrow, two of her three children, Amber Rose, 30 (six months pregnant) and Charlie, 29 (about to get married), are coming over for lunch to watch the men's final between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, a game that lasted 5hr 29 mins; the second longest in grand slam history. Her youngest daughter, Lily, 26, lives in Dubai.

This week, Croft is getting ready to begin commentating at the HSBC Championships at the Queen's Club, as women's events return there for the first time since 1973. Ten members of the women's top 20 will be playing, including Katie Boulter and Emma Raducanu. When I ask if she has “special interests”, she murmurs about Alcaraz and Raducanu, the former for being so utterly brilliant, thought of as the new Nadal, the latter because her trajectory has been so uneven, yet her promise never diminished.

It has been two years since Croft did the splits on Strictly, reaching fourth place, dancing with the energy, stamina and natural skill that must initially have surprised both her partner, Johannes Radebe, now one of her best friends, and the judges. It felt like every step was imbued with the emotion of her personal tragedy.

Mel Coleman died at Kingston Hospital in May 2023, just 12 weeks after he was diagnosed with Stage four colon cancer, which had spread throughout his body; 97 per cent of his liver was covered with tumours. Her husband of 30 years, they married in 1993 two days before her 27th birthday but they first met when she was just 21; she was in Sri Lanka making a TV show about learning to sail – Coleman was part of the sailing crew. She shows me an old VCR tape: “The moment I first met him and shook his hand is captured right here.” Then, Coleman was an America's Cup and Admiral's Cup sailor, before switching to investment banking.

Not long after meeting him Croft made the decision to retire from tennis. She was 21, ranked 24th in the world but had become tired of the tennis life, of hanging around in motels trying to scrabble enough for the bus fare to the next tournament: “I knew I didn't want to live my life as a tennis player until I was 30. I was emotionally intelligent early on to have worked that out.”

Sensing the happiness to be found in normal life off the circuit, and given, by then, she was something of a household name, she moved into entertainment: “There wasn't a Sky TV, or Eurosport so I couldn't move straight into commentary. I had to find other ways to make money.”

She began doing pantomime: “I needed the panto to give me confidence. If you force yourself into uncomfortable places you suddenly realise it's not as terrifying as you thought.”

Immediately after her retirement in 1988 she took over from Anneka Rice on Channel 4's Treasure Hunt. “I was always someone who thought you can't sit back and wait for things to come to you. You have to make things happen. No one gets up in the morning and thinks ‘I'm going to help Annabel today.'”

“We grew together,” she says of Coleman. She gestures around the house, and points outside to the tennis court: “The court was the first thing we put in.” When Coleman died, the couple had been in the process of planning their retirement, selling this house and relocating down the road to a smaller one. Every night, at bedtime Coleman told her he'd miss her until the morning: “I didn't know I had an incredible marriage, but I did,” she says. She is composed. Her grief is not as raw as it was after Strictly, now it “comes in rain showers, but they are getting less – and then it's gone.”

“You know he died of sepsis?” she asks me. The cancer had spread – he eschewed the opportunity for chemo for a better quality of life, and it's thought a tumour perforated on a flight back from Portugal. On his return, he was admitted as an emergency.

His death was as sudden as his diagnosis (both, she says, badly handled by Kingston Hospital). By July – “literally within a few weeks [of losing him] I was on the phone to my agent. He said ‘I've signed you up to Strictly. You're giving an interview tomorrow because they are announcing it.' I don't know what I would have done without being busy. I would have sunk.”

Strictly, she says, saved her – it also gave her Radebe – “we are bonded for life”. He calls her all the time. Sometimes they talk for two hours. “He's part of the family now,” she says, and shows me a picture of him lined up with her children: “Look! He's wearing Mel's sliders there.”

Her 1978 A4 homework is on the table in front of us. “Nice ideas,” her English teacher wrote. It's as though Croft foretold her life, minus the tragedy. “But there is so much to be positive about,” she says. By September, she will be a grandmother and she has properly rediscovered dance. During the tour, she will dance on stage: “I don't want to be a professional widow. I understand that a lot of people can identify with what I've been through, but I don't want grief to define me.

“People say I have been so generous with my emotions, but I have always been like that. Strictly was so helpful to me. I realised how much I loved dancing and I've wondered whether I went down the wrong path [with tennis] when I might have been a dancer instead.”

Two years on from Strictly, she is in the process of downsizing: “I mean, it's too big!” she says, “it's ridiculous. I'm rattling around here. The house has served its purpose.” She is clearing three decades of family life, including Coleman's possessions, his clothes and shoes. The family baby grand which sat in the hallway for twenty-five years has already gone. She's gravitating towards her eldest daughter (and her imminent grandchild) in Battersea, near enough to her friends and to Wimbledon. “Mel had always wanted a water view [because of his sailing] and I do too because it will connect me to him.”

Croft grew up in Farnborough, Kent, in a comfortable home with two siblings, an older brother and a younger sister. Her parents, James, a chartered surveyor, and Susan, a housewife, were “keen tennis players” but neither of them coaches or professionals.

They had a tennis court in the garden but it was at a Spanish hotel tennis tournament that she caught the bug. Her mother then started driving her 20 minutes to Park Langley tennis club in Beckenham, dropping her off “with 50p in my pocket for the cost of my lesson, a packet of crisps and a drink of squash, and I'd stay there all day. It was forehands on a Monday, backhands on a Tuesday, Wednesday was volleys, Thursdays serves and then playing points.”

She shows me a collection of childhood log books with scores: lists and lists of tennis partners – mostly boys – whom she organised into being her opponents. But she'd play anybody, often “wily old dogs”. What is telling about this is the extent of her drive.

“I'd have charts up on the fridge. It totally came from me. It should always come from the child. I met one of those boys recently and he said ‘I used to love coming to you because you always bossed us around and set all the drills. You organised everything.'”

As she started to hit a different league, she missed more and more school: “My dad was always writing requests to the head mistress to ask for time off: ‘Annabel won't be there on Friday, Annabel will miss this week for a tournament'. Slowly I dropped subjects until I was just down to maths, English and sport. I once sat a geography test, turned over the page and realised I didn't know a single thing.”

At fifteen, she moved to Houston, Texas for five years to train with a coach, who was the mixed doubles partner to Billie Jean King.“I travelled around the world six or seven times – that was my education. But it's so gladiatorial. It's like a boxing match.”

She plays me an audio clip of a match with “an American girl” at the Albert Hall, with Des Lynam commentating: “I'd had hypnotherapy before that”. She suffered badly from nerves. Would a sports psychologist have helped her? Made a difference to your longevity? I ask: “I don't think so. I knew myself.”

She is adamant that she made the right decision to retire. Today, there is an added pressure: Raducanu has recently had to deal with a creepy superfan who was evicted the Dubai Tennis Championships, “but [sadly] that comes with the territory,” says Croft. “There's way more security now, but what has changed is the birth of social media. Tennis players today, if they lose matches, get abuse from betting people who are going to lose a lot of money on somebody's match, and then they start attacking the player. That is a lot of stress and pressure. I wouldn't have been able to take that.”

Her life in retirement was about pushing on, pushing through the pain barrier in a different way: “Sometimes I'd be on the floor with a panic attack [with speaking engagements] but it was Bear Grylls who gave me the best advice. Mel is godfather to his first son. He said “Annabel, don't try to be somebody you are not.”

Perhaps it is because she is, as she says, “a naturally sunny person” that she has fared so well on mainstream television. She shows me a tabloid from 1988 where she's on the front page wearing a bikini, publicising her role in the Channel 4 reality show Survivor, which involved a group of people attempting to survive on a deserted island. There are photographs in Hello – it's easy to forget how famous she was back then.

I can see why she invites such love and loyalty: “My oldest friend from when I was seven often comes to stay with her husband.” Her children have gathered around her. Her son Charlie phones her every day during his coffee break: “They are always asking ‘what are your plans, who are you having dinner with? Come and join us!'” But she's a very long way from thinking of another partner, “I can't think about it at the moment. I just really can't.”

“I want to simplify my life, maybe go on walking holidays and be close to family to help. I don't have a driving ambition anymore [but] I am probably kidding myself when I think I would be happy if I just did nothing. If there is one message I have in my tour, it is do something that makes you happy because you never know what is round the corner.”

Coleman was an investment banker for about 18 years, commuting on the tube and sitting behind a desk, but he was “a free-spirited yachtsman” whom Croft says should never have had an office job: “I used to call him Crocodile Dundee.” The white van they converted into “Vannabel” for camping holidays sits on the drive: “It's a difficult one. I don't know what to do with it.”

Coleman's treatment during his illness has left its mark. The delivery of his diagnosis was blunt, but it was his end-of-life care that was truly horrific. The news of his imminent death was broken to Croft and the family callously by a nurse, as Coleman lay within earshot.

This time, it was Croft who wanted to protect him, the 6ft 4in towering man she nicknamed “Mr Incredible”, who only three months earlier had been entertaining everyone, able to fix everything in the house. The lack of kindness in this worst moment was incomprehensible to her. She says “I have had several meetings since and I've received an apology from the hospital.” She still finds it hard to discuss: “It's such an awful subject. We don't need to talk about it now. Maybe sometime over a glass of wine.”

Mercifully, she says, in the 12 weeks leading up to Coleman's death, both of them had been supported by Dr Isabella Cooper, a biochemist specialising in mitochondria, leading a team of cancer researchers at Westminster Hospital. Through a strict ketogenic diet (based on eliminating sugar, low carb, meat heavy) Dr Isabella Cooper reduced the tumour coverage on Coleman's liver from 97 per cent to 70 percent.

It appeared that his new diet was holding the disease back, before the sepsis set in: “I'm at peace with the fact that Mel died with hope, rather than no hope.” Croft says. “Isabella gave us so much hope. She was the only person who gave Mel hope. And if one positive thing can come out of losing Mel, I would love to give a platform to her work.”

She still talks to Cooper every day and now follows a mostly sugar-free diet. She opens her fridge to show me streaky bacon without sugar additives and smoked salmon with no hidden sugars: “I have a huge appetite,” she says. You've got to be kidding? “Oh yes! I ate the same amount as Mel.”

“But I have a very high metabolism and my children say to me ‘slow down'.”

There is something very old school about Annabel Croft, much like Wimbledon itself. This month Croft will again be part of the BBC's commentary lineup at the tournament. Shortly after Strictly, she appeared at the Princess of Wales' trophy presentation, interviewing the Wimbledon winners. “The standards at Wimbledon are incredibly high,” she says. “Everything is immaculate, from the manicured plants to the seating to not a cable being out of place.”

However, this year will be the first tournament without human line judges, replaced by AI-powered cameras: “I'm torn. I'd rather have the correct line call if somebody's Grand Slam is riding on a bad call [from a judge]. People do have less attention span and it will speed tennis up, but the line judges are full of personality and it makes tennis entertaining.”

I can't draw her to express a view on the thorny issue of trans women competing in female categories. “I'm not in a place where I want to attract unwanted aggression towards me.” But I can tell she does have views, “Maybe if I'd retired I'd express a view. I do think there isn't enough debate anymore – or humour. Certain subjects have been shut down, we have not been allowed to debate them.”

Croft is a big fan of TCW (formerly called The Conservative Woman) the online magazine and podcast created by her friend Kathy Gyngell to defend freedom of speech and challenge Left-liberal thinking: “I adore her. She is a woman who will stand up for what she believes in. She is the brightest woman I have ever met. I admire her courage.”

Courage is a good word for Croft too – and resilience: “Ooh I should use that word more.” In the space of two years, she has gone from not knowing how online banking works – “Mel did all of that” – to being able to take the back of the tumble dryer to fix it: “I remember seeing him do it. When it broke down, I went and got his tool box.” Water streamed through the roof shortly after he died – she dealt with that. She can pump up a car tyre as well.

“Mel's watching over me and teaching me a lot. I probably would have gone my whole life never doing these things had Mel been around. But I can do it all now. I've learned I can do things on my own, things I didn't ever think I could.”

Born to tennis royalty, Draper's supreme work ethic and ascent up the rankings in the past 12 months have been astonishing. Here's why Kieran Jackson believes he poses a serious challenge to Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner for the Wimbledon title

To pinpoint the exact moment where British No 1 Jack Draper launched his ascent to the upper echelons of men's tennis, you'd need only go back 12 months this very weekend. 

Off the back of a disappointing first-round exit at the 2024 French Open, Draper broke his ATP title duck with a statement triumph on the grass in Stuttgart. That week, as he has since acknowledged, something clicked in his big-hitting, flamboyant lefty game. 

A few days later, the Brit outgunned Carlos Alcaraz at Queen's. While the Spaniard would go on to win his second title at SW19 a few weeks later, Draper slumped to a disappointing second-round loss to compatriot Cameron Norrie.

However, what has followed has been splendid. A US Open semi-final, a title in Vienna last October and a Masters 1000 victory in Indian Wells in March – a tournament seen by many as the fifth Grand Slam. Yet, most impressive of all? A newfound physical and mental resilience to compete with the very best, week in, week out. 

The net result? A career-high ranking of world No 4 for the 23-year-old from Sutton. Frustratingly, he will enter Queen's on Monday at No 5, behind Novak Djokovic, with his Stuttgart points dropping off. But the race to be fourth seed at Wimbledon – with the prospect of avoiding the likes of Jannik Sinner, Alexander Zverev and Alcaraz until the semi-final – is very much on, as Draper returns to Queen's this week.

The summer of '24 was a huge turning point. Draper, the son of former LTA chief executive Roger and ex-British junior tennis champion Nicky, has struggled immensely with injuries and physical fitness since turning professional in 2021. Shoulder and hip issues – remember Andy Murray's issues with the latter – have plagued him, while he has regularly vomited on court in humid conditions. 

“Coming into last year, the only goal was to stay fit and healthy,” Draper's long-term coach, James Trotman, told the ATP website in March. Interestingly, Draper's short-term coaching trial with South African ex-pro Wayne Ferreira last summer did not last more than a few months, with the Brit ultimately placing complete trust in Trotman, who is double his age at 46. 

“We were at the point where it didn't matter how good he could be, or was going to be, our focus was to keep him fit. It's challenging to build up trust in your body again. It's not something that happens instantly. This has been a long journey.

”It wasn't just one injury, it was three or four on the back of each other. I thought that was enough. ‘What are we going to do here, Jack? Who are the people we're going to put around you?' That was the first objective. It's okay to fail, but if we do, it's not because we're not trying.”

Sporting a backwards cap at all times – Lleyton Hewitt-esque – Draper emits something of a braggadocio persona; yet that could not be further from the truth. First emerging in the public eye in 2018, Draper reached the final of junior Wimbledon, winning a marathon semi-final 19-17 in the final set after four hours and 23 minutes. His heart in the heat of battle has never wavered. Quickly, he was elevated to the role of hitting partner for the Great Britain Davis Cup team. 

“There was a lot of potential there,” Trotman said of Draper, the junior. “He was very small until the age of 15 or 16. He grew up as a smaller player, having to compete against bigger guys, having to defend and find ways of being competitive against the stronger players who could hit him off the court.

“His identity from a young age was to be a little bit more defensive. All of a sudden, he grows to 6' 4” and he's serving out of a tree and hitting the ball big. A big part of that coaching journey that we're still on today is to try and impose his weapons on the court and take the racquet out of his opponent's hand.”

Draper was also able to learn from Murray during the latter stages of his career as part of the Davis Cup team, while showcasing his personality. Notably, GB's celebrations on the way back from the 2023 victory over France, where a young Draper, in a bucket hat and sipping a beer, belted out The Proclaimers' classic “500 Miles”, with the viral video showing an unimpressed Murray.

Whilst his raw ability – his fierce serve and swashbuckling forehand are his two greatest assets – has never been in doubt, his fitness over best-of-five set tennis has often been placed under the microscope. In fact, not unlike the early stages of Murray's career. Pleasingly, Draper dedicated his most recent off-season, when nursing a hip injury, to his physical conditioning and notably employed a breathing coach.

“I had a lot of problems with my sinuses when I was younger so I breathe a lot through my mouth,” explained Draper, having come through three back-to-back five-set matches at the Australian Open in January. 

“When you are anxious or have long points and you have to recover quickly, it's not efficient to breathe through your mouth. So, I've been trying to reverse what I do and breathe through my nose a lot more.”

Fast-forward six months, Draper is one of the fittest athletes on tour. So much so that the effervescent Alexander Bublik, prior to beating the Brit in the fourth round, said to him at Roland Garros: “Are you getting ready for UFC?!”

Now firmly rooted in the top 10 in the rankings, Draper does not want his upward trajectory to stop. The Putney resident was back on court at Queen's ahead of the tournament, hitting with former world No 14 Kyle Edmund, who knows a thing or two about career-impacting injuries. 

Draper will play just one warm-up tournament, at Queen's, before Wimbledon. While still a step short of Sinner and Alcaraz's insane level of consistency, as shown by their magnificent five-hour-plus Roland-Garros final, the Briton has the potential to cause an upset if either player has an off day. 

He has beaten both Sinner and Alcaraz at Queen's, in 2021 and 2024. His hard-hitting game is well-suited to the quick nature of grass-court tennis. And should the draw surprisingly open up at any point, he will be ready to pounce at SW19.

Canada's Gabriel Diallo captured his first ATP Tour title at the Libema Open in the Netherlands on Sunday.

The 23-year-old from Montreal defeated Belgium's Zizou Bergs 7-5, 7-6 (8).

In what was a tight, back-and-forth second set, Diallo was down 6-4 in the tiebreaker before pulling victory from the jaws of defeat. He got three straight points from then on before eventually taking the win.

“Oh man, I don't have the words. It's something that you dream of for your whole life since you were a little kid, to get an ATP Tour title,” Diallo said in his on-court interview. “The fact that I was able to do it here after losing a final last year, it just means the world to me. 

""I'm very happy, not only for myself but for my whole team.”



Diallo, who is ranked 55th in the world, had nine aces and two double faults. He won 76 per cent of points on first serve and converted his lone break-point attempt.

It was just Diallo's second career final after finishing runner-up at the Almaty Open in October.

The six-foot-eight Diallo was the first Canadian men's singles finalist in event history.

He's projected to rise to a career-high 44th overall with the victory.

For now, Diallo is set to take his momentum into Wimbledon, where he appears likely to make his main-draw debut after missing qualifying in each of the past two years.

Diallo also reach the quarterfinals of the Madrid Open last month before falling in the second round of the French Open.

Wimbledon, the iconic grass-court major, is set to begin June 30. Diallo will first compete at London's HSBC Queen's Club Championships beginning Monday, where he will face England's Billy Harris in the Round of 32.

Taylor Fritz captured his fourth ATP Tour title on grass and ninth overall on Sunday at the BOSS OPEN in Stuttgart, where he defeated World No. 3 Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6(0).

In a rain-disrupted final, Fritz produced an impressive performance on serve to maintain his dominant recent record against Zverev. The American fired 11 aces, did not face a break point and won 88 per cent of his first-serve points to improve to 8-5 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series against the German.

Fritz, who has now won his past five meetings against Zverev, will return to No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings following his triumph. The American displaces British lefty Jack Draper, who had dislodged Fritz in fourth spot last Monday.

""It was not so great a clay season, so to come here and start the grass season off perfectly, I am super happy to get the title and to do it here,"" Fritz said.

He is SO back 🙌@Taylor_Fritz97 | @boss__open | #BossOpen pic.twitter.com/znvWcYLF8C

Fritz did not drop a set all week at the ATP 250 event in Germany and is the first player to lift a tour-level trophy without losing serve since Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard in Basel last October.

Among active players, only Novak Djokovic has more grass-court titles (8) than Taylor Fritz. The American has claimed four, including three at Eastbourne, putting him level alongside Matteo Berrettini and Nicolas Mahut.

Fritz arrived in Stuttgart seeking form, having suffered a shock opening-round exit against Daniel Altmaier at Roland Garros. The second seed looked comfortable all week in Germany and was in control for large periods against Zverev.

The American rushed the German with his depth and aggressive forehand in the opening set, clinching the decisive break in the eighth game before holding serve to lead. Rain suspended play for 65 minutes at the start of the second set and when they returned, there was little between the Top 10 stars. With a tie-break left to decide the set, Fritz fired three winners and benefited from Zverev errors to capture his first title of the season.

At the core of proper serve and ball-throwing motions is the kinetic chain—the sequence of movements that begins in the legs and flows up through the hips, torso, shoulder, arm, and wrist. In both cases, power is not generated solely by the arm—it's a full-body motion, with energy flowing upward and outward.The most notable difference between the two motions is the release point. Depending on how far you're intending to throw the ball will often determine how far into the motion you let it out of your hand. The serve would be most comparable to a deep pass in football or an outfielder trying to gun down a baserunner at home plate.Here are a few reasons why “throwing” the racquet will improve your serve:

© 2025 Eurasia Sport Images

Ever try to throw a ball with a rigid arm and static lower body? It's not going very far. To put some zip on the throw, your arm needs to be loose, knees flexed and your weight transferring toward your target. Similarly, serving with a stiff arm and poor body integration yields little power and inconsistent results. Good timing and tempo ensures that all parts of the body work together to amplify force and reduce injury risk.It encourages shoulder turn and optimal elbow positioning.Both motions involve external rotation of the shoulder as the arm is drawn back (cocking phase). A key feature is the ""L"" shape created between the upper arm and forearm just before acceleration. In tennis, this is commonly called the “trophy” position. It's followed by a rapid internal rotation leading to the release or contact. This action is essential for generating maximum racquet head speed up through impact.

A good wrist snap and some forearm pronation are the finishing touches on a powerful serve or throw. It not only adds zip to the delivery, but is pivotal to applying spin and manipulating the placement of the shot. The non-dominant arm also chips in by tucking into the waist to slow the upper body to cause the arm to accelerate before having a full follow-through.This allows the energy to dissipate naturally and safely and helps maintain balance and recovery. Just remember to hang on to your racquet.

Charles Leclerc could not hide his frustration after taking P8 in Qualifying for the Canadian Grand Prix, with the Monegasque believing that the car had the pace to take pole position, while Ferrari team mate Lewis Hamilton is hoping to fight for a podium from P5.

The final minutes of Q3 proved messy for Leclerc, who set a strong first sector on one of his final flying laps before a mistake in Sector 2 ruined his effort. And while he had time to go again, the 27-year-old could not move up higher than eighth place, leaving him visibly angry afterwards.

“Our pace was there,” Leclerc reflected after Qualifying. “I think the car was good enough for pole, but I f***** it up completely and I'm very annoyed. I just got out the car so obviously emotions are running high. I'm very annoyed.

“I don't know if it was the right thing or not to go out early – we ended up having Isack [Hadjar] in the middle of Turn 6 or 7. He was 100 metres in front, but with these cars and on a track like this you lose all the grip.

P8 Leclerc: ‘The pace was there, the car was good enough for pole… I'm very annoyed'

“It's a shame because until then I think it was… I mean, we only had done seven corners but I think it was good enough for pole so I'm very frustrated. I think today the car was really good and we haven't maximised anything.”

After missing most of Friday's action – due to damage on his car from a crash in FP1 forcing him to sit out FP2 – Leclerc was able to hit the ground running in third and final practice, going second fastest in that session.

HIGHLIGHTS: Russell snatches Canada pole ahead of Verstappen and Piastri

When pushed on whether this recovery gave him hope for what he could achieve on Sunday, Leclerc responded: “No, it's irrelevant. When you do that in Qualifying then there's nothing that gives me satisfaction.”

On the other side of the garage, Hamilton did not have an entirely smooth session but was keen to take the positives as he prepares to line up in P5 on a day where former Mercedes team mate George Russell grabbed pole position.

Hamilton ‘gunning for a podium' from P5 in Sunday's Canadian Grand Prix

“We were never going to get pole, I think, clearly,” the seven-time World Champion reflected. “Mercedes brought an upgrade I think, or I just heard, and congrats to them. Their car's always suited this track, so [I'm] happy for them.

“On our side it's been very, very, very tricky, but I think a better performance than Ferrari had last year which is positive, and I'm still going to be gunning for trying to see if we can get a podium for once – that's the goal tomorrow.”

FACTS AND STATS: Russell bags consecutive Montreal poles while Verstappen starts P2

Asked about how much more he has felt at one with the car in Montreal, Hamilton acknowledged that he is still adapting to the SF-25 as he responded: “I don't feel at one with the car. I haven't all year.”

And in terms of when this might happen, the Briton conceded: “I don't know if I will this year.”

Both the Mercedes and Red Bull drivers improved with their final efforts at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve, which also came on the medium Pirelli tyre as opposed to the softest compound of rubber available.

Lando Norris believes that ""too many mistakes"" and pushing ""a bit hard"" during a challenging Qualifying for the Canadian Grand Prix was what left him down in seventh on the grid.

The McLaren driver had shown impressive pace during the earlier segments of Qualifying in Montreal, which included topping Q1 and finishing second in Q2.

But the Briton was left on the back foot in Q3, running wide at the final chicane with his first effort before putting in another attempt which left him with a 1m 11.625s.

While others, including polesitter George Russell and team mate Oscar Piastri improved with their final attempts, Norris failed to find time and will start seventh for Sunday's race.

Norris will start only seventh on the grid for the Canadian Grand Prix

The McLaren duo had also opted against using the medium compound of Pirelli tyre in the final stages, with Russell and Max Verstappen opting to use the C5 option instead of the soft C6 to lock out the front row.

""I just pushed a bit hard and too many mistakes,"" said Norris post-session as he reflected on his lower than hoped for grid slot.

When asked what might have been possible, he replied: ""Good enough for a top three, probably not good enough for pole.

""Hard to know how much was maybe the medium tyre performing that little bit better, especially when the grip comes up. Maybe the medium is a touch better but it was a gamble.

""It was a risk and I guess every team has their own opinion on what they thought was best and clearly we didn't think that was going to be better. But we did what we did and I just didn't put it together when I needed to.""

Norris trails Piastri by 10 points in the Drivers' Championship and will have Kimi Antonelli, Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso between himself and his main title rival, with Norris believing it will be difficult to make much headway in the Grand Prix.

""It's tough to say,"" said Norris. ""I think we're maybe a little bit quicker than some of the cars ahead but not all of them. Top five is probably a good start.""

After nine races of Max Verstappen and the McLarens duking it out for Saturday honours, in Canada we have a new game in town, with George Russell on pole for the second year in a row in Montreal.

Pirelli have gone a step softer in their range this season so we're likely to get graining, and multiple stops – and it's a rare year when the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve doesn't produce a Safety Car or two. Teams are demonstrating different approaches in their tyre choices and all the evidence suggests there's a fierce strategy battle to be fought today…

Yuki Tsunoda has questioned the decision by the Canadian Grand Prix stewards to award him a 10-place grid penalty for a red flag infringement, claiming ""I don't know what they wanted me to do"".

The Red Bull driver was hauled in front of the stewards on Saturday after passing Oscar Piastri's damaged McLaren during a red flag period in FP3.

WATCH: Piastri brings out red flags in FP3 after hitting Wall of Champions in Canada

Piastri had caused the stoppage after hitting the Wall of Champions, which damaged the right-rear tyre as debris was strewn across the track on his way back to the pits.

Tsunoda came across the damaged McLaren on the back straight and passed Piastri, but was summoned to the stewards after the session for his actions.

Despite acknowledging that Tsunoda had been wary of being hit by debris, the stewards deemed ""there was no justifiable reason"" for the Japanese driver to overtake and handed him the same penalty given to Haas' Ollie Bearman for the same offence in Monaco.

""The 10-place grid penalty came out of nowhere to be honest, I didn't even expect to be summoned for that,"" said Tsunoda following Qualifying in Montreal, where his P11 finish will see him start the Grand Prix at the back of the grid.

""I don't know what they wanted me to do. Oscar had massive damage in the last corner, I saw him in the back straight driving 80kph, very slow. He was spraying debris everywhere and I saw even the tyre was going sideways so I thought if I keep driving behind, at one point the tyre is going to come off and hit me. You want to avoid that and it's a very unnecessary situation.

""In the end, he was driving on the far left to obviously avoid causing issues with other drivers which I think he did a very good job and that's why I went far right, with a clear view.

""I obviously checked there was no car in front, car behind, and I overtook him 170kph which is like half the speed we normally drive to avoid an unnecessary situation.

‘I don't know what they wanted me to do' – Tsunoda not happy with grid penalty in Montreal

""But apparently that's not allowed, apparently they expect me to sit behind a car and wait to get hit. I don't think I deserve this penalty because debris was all over the place, not just the last corner. I don't know what they want me to do to be honest. It's frustrating.""

Now facing a back-of-the-grid start for the Canadian Grand Prix, Tsunoda explained he still needed time to feel confident in his Red Bull machine.

""I don't have that confidence and trust yet, it will come but not yet,"" added Tsunoda about his Qualifying performance.

""Obviously I'm not happy with P11. I think the balance was pretty good, the team did a fantastic job to support me in those areas but I just need time, especially having that issue in FP3 didn't help much.""

""I can feel the weight of abandoning these people who have written over the years, ‘You saved my life,' ‘I got sober because of you.' And there's part of me that's like, ‘Are they going to be ok?'"" Maron said. 


							By 

	Caitlin Huston


Business Writer


Marc Maron is contemplating what life will be like post-podcast as he approaches the end of the WTF with Marc Maron Podcast.


	Speaking after the Tribeca Film Festival screening Saturday of Are We Good?, a documentary about Maron grappling with the loss of his partner Lynn Shelton and trying to channel his grief into his work, Maron was asked about giving so much of himself to the public via his long-running podcast, his comedy specials and even on his Instagram. Maron had announced earlier this month that the podcast would be ending this fall after 16 years.

	“I do put a lot of it out there. And I can handle it, and I can be gracious about it. And I don't know what it's going to be like not to do that twice a week,” Maron said in reference to the podcast. “And I don't know what part of it is my own neediness or my own need to connect. But I can feel the weight of abandoning these people who have written over the years, ‘You saved my life,' ‘I got sober because of you,' ‘I didn't kill myself.' And there's part of me that's like ‘Are they going to be ok? Should I reach out to them personally?'”


	Tony and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Tracy Letts, a friend of Maron's, led the talkback, which also included documentary director Steven Feinartz.


	“It's a bit much, Tracy, is what I'm saying, and I think I deserve to try to figure out how to live my life not with privacy, but without that responsibility a little bit,” Maron added. 


WTF has been one of the most streamed podcasts since it launched on Sept. 1, 2009, and has included interviews between Maron and famous figures such as Robin Williams, Keith Richards, Nicole Kidman and former President Barack Obama. The episodes, conducted out of Maron's garage, also offer a revealing look at Maron's own life, with the host often talking about his personal life, pet peeves and grudges and relationships with the guests on the show. 

	











	He announced the end of the show June 2, saying that he and his producing partner Brendan McDonald were “burnt out” after doing two shows every week for 16 years. 


	In the talkback, Maron added that he had not started the podcast with the goal of making money or creating content, but rather was looking to create a connection with each guest and have “an empathic conversation with somebody about who they are.” He added that it was also his “whole fucking social life.”  


	“It meant the world to me and really evolved my sense of self and my sense of being a person,” he said. 


	“All of this stuff that I do has fueled whatever my particular creativity is. And I'm sure I'm not going to disappear after the podcast,” Maron continued. “But the goal will now be to figure out where to channel that creativity.”


	In the near term that will include another HBO comedy special set to release in August, and the new Apple show Stick, alongside Owen Wilson.

Additional celebrities including Anna Kendrick, Gina Rodriguez-LoCicero and Tessa Thompson were out on Saturday to protest against the Trump administration. 



		By Lexi Carson, McKinley Franklin 

	June 14, 2025 2:56pm	




	Hollywood is out participating in the “No Kings” protests.


	People are protesting all across the country, including in major cities like Los Angeles and New York City, against President Donald Trump and his policies, just hours ahead of his military parade for the U.S. Army's 250th Anniversary in Washington on Saturday, which is also Trump‘s birthday.




Mark Ruffalo spoke with MSNBC at a protest in New York City and was asked why people were out protesting in the rain “to send a message,” to which he responded, “Because we see our democracy is in real trouble.”

	“We see a president who has made himself a king and dictator, and we don't seen an opposition that's powerful enough to stand up against the trampling of our rights and the trampling of the Constitution that's happening every single day with executive orders, with the refusal to obey court orders, kidnapping of immigrants, people who are here legally, people who their children are being taken from them,” Ruffalo added. “We're disgusted and we're scared, and we know that the only way that — to fight this now is for the people, is to come together.”

Jimmy Kimmel, attended a protest in San Francisco with his parents. “A huge, inspiring and yes — peaceful — turnout in the South Bay. I met many people who love this country and still believe it to be a force for good. I am grateful to see so many Americans take action to stand up for our friends and neighbors, most of all, my parents,” he wrote on Instagram. “I know how fortunate I am to have been born into a family that taught me to care about others and that the most important words ever spoken are ‘Love one another.' It really is as simple as that.”

	Olivia Rodrigo posted a photo of a sign with a crossed out crown and the words “in our USA” on her Instagram Story. “That's So True” singer Gracie Abrams, too, took to her Instagram Stories, sharing two photos in crowds that read, “Free speech is not an insurrection” and “If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor,” with the latter quote being from Desmond Tutu.


	Dan Bucatinsky and Marisa Tomei posed for a few pictures together at protests on his Instagram. In the caption, he wrote, “Coming together to show what Democracy looks like. #nokings #obama #lgbtq #stand #america.”

	Marketing to specific audiences continues to cost film studios and distributors millions of dollars each year, however, “reliance on focus groups and long-held audience assumptions are outdated concepts and costing the industry millions more in lost revenue opportunities.”


	This is the verdict of audience intelligence platform DiO, who have spent the last two years analysing how different trailers and other screen content lands with particular audiences.


	DiO claims their analysis tools – including facial coding, biometric and cognitive data – confound traditional assumptions about audience appetites, and reveal a surprising shift in how viewers engage emotionally with what they see on screen.

	Their research was conducted across 37,000 consumers of content and key findings include:




			Watch on Deadline		







	DiO CEO and founder Ade Shannon said: “This data points towards a shifting perception of masculinity and an evolving appetite for richer, more grounded storytelling.”


	Indie production studio True Brit recently used the data amassed by DiO to plan the marketing campaign around their title Marching Powder, specifically to pinpoint aspects of the film that would appeal to potential viewers outside its core 35+ male audience.


	Released in March, Marching Powder stars popular “hardman” British actor Danny Dyer as Jack, a man arrested for fighting and drug possession during a football hooligan brawl, who is ordered by court to go to couples' therapy.


	True Brit shares that tweaking their campaign based on the data boosted their strong box office opening of £3.1m against a £1.6m production budget, specifically increasing its female audience to 45% without isolating their core audience.


	Commenting on the strategy, Chris Besseling, the studio's head of theatrical distribution, Marketing and Publicity, said: “Using the detailed analytics provided by DiO's report, we were able to identify the specific moments, characters, lines and gags from the trailer that resonated most strongly with the two distinctly different audiences that we were targeting. This enabled us to build a tailored, two-pronged campaign with bespoke creative assets that best served the different potential audience groups.”

The Boys star Erin Moriarty shared she was recently diagnosed with Graves' disease, advocating for people to listen to their bodies, especially when in pain.


	“Autoimmune disease manifests differently in everybody/every body,” she wrote in an Instagram post. “Your experience will be different from mine. My experience will be different from yours. Perhaps greatly, perhaps minutely.”


	Per the Cleveland Clinic, the autoimmune disorder affects the thyroid gland, resulting in the overproduction of the thyroid hormone, also known as hyperthyroidism, the most common cause of which is Graves' disease. A very common illness, it's most prevalent among women and people younger than 40, with wide-ranging symptoms that can include heat sensitivity, weight loss, tremors, irregular heartbeat and potentially Graves' ophthalmopathy, which develops in 1 out of 3 people with Graves' disease and includes eye issues like bulging eyes, light sensitivity and eye pressure or irritation. Untreated Graves' disease can lead to heart problems and osteoporosis, and treatments include medication like beta-blockers and antithyroid agents, as well as radioiodine therapy and surgery.

	“One thing I can say: if I hadn't chalked it all up to stress and fatigue, I would've caught this sooner,” she added. “A month ago, I was diagnosed with Graves' disease. Within 24 hours of beginning treatment, I felt the light coming back on. It's been increasing in strength ever since. If yours is dimming, even slightly, go get checked. Don't ‘suck it up' and transcend suffering; you deserve to be comfy. Sh–'s hard enough as is.”


	Interspersed with the images of the actress were screenshots of texts sent to her parents: one seemingly prior to her diagnosis sent to her mom and the other presumably after treatment had begun sent to her dad. The former read: “I'm serious; I really really need relief. I feel nauseated tonight. I feel so sh– and removed from who I am, I can't live like this forever. Or that long. There aren't moments anymore, not even a passing 5 seconds, when I feel normal. I've never had that. Not one. It's not just fatigue – it's an ineffable, system wide cry for help and I don't know how long I can remain in this state.” In the latter, she wrote, “I already feel a world of a difference, primary thought (as of now): ‘damn, this is how I'm supposed to feel? I've been missing out!'”

	











	In the comments, industry peers shared supportive emojis, including The Boys‘ costar Susan Heyward and See actress Nesta Cooper. The Boys director Shana Stein wrote, “So happy you're on the road to healing.”


	Largely known for her work on Prime Video's The Boys, Moriarty portrays supe Starlight/Annie January, who leaves the Seven to join the cause against the megalomaniacal Homelander (Antony Starr). While there's no official release date for the fifth and final season of the Eric Kripke-created satire, due to be released next year, the cast teased a “climactic end” to Deadline at a recent FYC panel.

	After delivering a crowd pleaser with one of her latest characters, Ego Nwodim was just as shocked as the FCC likely was by the audience's response.


	The Saturday Night Live star recalled the on-air reaction to her Miss Eggy character “did throw me for a loop” after a call-and-response bit inadvertently caused the crowd to yell “s—” during a Season 50 episode that aired in April.


	“We did not think they were going to say anything because, if we did think so, and if we thought what they were going to say was going to be a curse word, it would have been flagged and it would have been taken out of the sketch,” she explained to Collider. “Even if I would have loved for it to stay, and I would have no control over it. So the second time we did Miss Eggy, we couldn't do ‘because these men ain't what?' again. We might have even tried to, or we talked about it, and standards and practices was like, ‘No, you can't do that, because we know what the audience is going to do.'”

	Nwodim added, “It is wild that it didn't occur to any of us. But I was sincerely stunned. And it was really cool. Honestly, it tickled me that they did that. Then I got to do a thing that I love so much, which is improvised in character. That was an amazing experience to get to do that, and so rewarding and so fun and rewarding and possibly costly.”


	During the bit, Nwodim prompted the crowd with, “'cause these men ain't what?” before receiving the profane response.


	Whether the NBC sketch comedy show was fined by the FCC, Nwodim said, “I don't know. I don't know if we got fined. I don't think so. But anyway, fun time. It was like a little dance with the audience. We were dancing. We were grooving.”

	











	The FCC's own guidelines may have provided SNL with a reprieve, outlining that “indecent and profane content are prohibited on broadcast TV and radio between 6am and 10pm, when there is a reasonable risk that children may be in the audience,” whereas the show begins airing at 11:30pm ET.


	Aided by a slight delay, the West Coast and Mountain SNL broadcasts' cleansing of the “s—” would appear to have handled any FCC backlash for the show, which airs in primetime in those regions.

	Tributes have been pouring in this past week for Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys co-founder and pop music maestro, following his death aged 82. 


	But there have been possibly none so personal as the memories of writer David Leaf, who has recalled how he set out for Los Angeles in 1976 with the firm intention of writing a book about Wilson and his work. 


	As well as writing his book The Beach Boys and the Californian Myth which was published in 1978, Leaf became close friends with his subject after one particular night when he realised just how sweet, but also fragile, Wilson really was.

Leaf tells The Times of London he had encountered Wilson a handful of times during his first months in the city, and recognised him as “a deeply gentle, seemingly defeated soul, before one night cemented their friendship. He writes:




			Watch on Deadline		







	“Melody Maker's West Coast correspondent Harvey Kubernik had rescued Brian as he wandered dangerously in the middle of a busy Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood. Brian admitted to taking too many downers.


	“Harvey and the radio DJ Rodney Bingenheimer then drove Brian to what they were certain was safe harbour: my apartment.


	“It was well after midnight when there was a knock on my door. I opened it, shocked to see the threesome. The LA scenesters left, Brian came in and asked if I had anything to eat. There were two leftover slices of pizza. After a quick reheating in the toaster oven, he wolfed them down. Then he went to sleep on the living room couch. Around 4am he woke up and asked for a ride home.”

	











	Leaf went on to become friends with Wilson, including serving as an usher at his 1995 wedding to Melinda Ledbetter. The writer recounts often going to dinner with Wilson, and hearing him sing along to the car radio. 


	He also recounts a visit by Wilson to perform at HM The Queen's Golden Jubilee in 2002, when the American artist pushed past Ozzy Osbourne to greet Elizabeth II with “Hi, Queen.”


	Tributes have come in from across the music industry this week. Sir Paul McCartney, who always credited Wilson's God Only Knows as his favourite ever song, said: 


	“Brian had that mysterious sense of musical genius that made his songs so achingly special. The notes he heard in his head and passed to us were simple and brilliant at the same time. I loved him, and was privileged to be around his bright shining light for a little while. How we will continue without Brian Wilson, ‘God Only Knows.'”

James Bond may live to see another chapter in his new Amazon home, but British director Danny Boyle has ruled himself out of joining him there.


	The Oscar winner (for Slumdog Millionaire) was the director of the 25th Bond movie, until he dropped out in 2018 over creative differences with the producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson. He was replaced by Cary Joji Fukunaga, and the film No Time to Die was released in 2021.


	Asked if he would consider picking up the baton again with the sale of the franchise to Amazon, Boyle told Business Insider: “That ship has sailed.”

	He added that the one regret he had about leaving the project in 2018 was that “the script was really good. John Hodge (Boyle's longtime collaborator) is a wonderful writer.”




			Watch on Deadline		







Business Insider added that Boyle had previously revealed his plot would revolve around a Russian villain, and would have included the death of Bond – as later eventuated in No Time to Die – as actor Daniel Craig had negotiated that finale as part of his contract.


	James Bond has been one of the big screen's great icons since his first outing in 1962's Dr No under the aegis of producer Albert “Cubby” Broccoli. His daughter Barbara and stepson Wilson inherited the project and have steered the brand into a billion-dollar franchise over the last three decades.


	Prior to the headline-grabbing complete buy-out by Amazon, Broccoli said she would not be rushed on finding a replacement for her leading man.

	











In March, the Daily Mail newspaper quoted an production insider explaining:


	“There have been so many erroneous rumours about the future of Bond. Amazon is committed to keeping the spirit of Bond alive and that means he has to be British or from the Commonwealth – and he has to be male.”

	Distributor Mubi has responded to backlash over its recent source of investment – $100million worth from Sequoia Capital. 


	It was reported by Puck last month that Mubi had secured the sum from Sequia, a Silicon Valley-based company with investments in a wide range of companies, ranging from Apple to ByteDance and also with close ties to defence-tech startup Kela, founded in 2024 by a group of Israeli intelligence veterans in response to the Hamas attacks of October 7 2023.. The website reports that Kela is currently developing a battlefield operating system enabling military units to integrate AI and commercial tech.

	This comes against a polarised discussion in cultural and creative circles pertaining to the Israel-Gaza conflict and some calls online for Mubi to be boycotted. Some customers online say they have cancelled their subscriptions and Film Workers for Palestine said it was “horrified” by Mubi's decision. “This is unacceptable, and we demand that Mubi return the investment,” it wrote in a much-shared Instagram post.

Now Mubi have responded, sharing this statement on their Instagram account Saturday:


	“Since our founding, MUBI has raised money from a number of sources to help us grow. Our decision to work with outside investors has always served one purpose: to accelerate our mission of delivering bold and visionary films to global audiences. This was the rationale behind our recent partnership with the venture firm Sequoia Capital.“Sequoia has a 50-plus year history of partnering with founders to help turn their ideas into world-changing businesses. Sequoia's investments span a range of founders, industries, and geographies. We chose to work with Sequoia because the firm, and our Sequoia Partner Andrew Reed, support MUBI's mission and want to help us scale and bring great cinema to even more people around the world.“Over the last several days, some members of our community have commented on the decision to work with Sequoia given their investment in Israeli companies and the personal opinions expressed by one of their partners. The beliefs of individual investors do not reflect the views of MUBI.“We take the feedback from our community very seriously, and are steadfast in remaining an independent founder-led company.”


	Mubi previously went on a buying spree at Cannes Film Festival, including spending $24 million on Die My Love, starring Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson. Its biggest cinematic success so far is The Substance, which made approximately $80million at the box office and brought Demi Moore an Oscar nomination earlier this year.

The husband of a “Real Housewives” executive assistant, Lauren Miller, has courageously spoken out on social media to give an update after his wife died immediately following the birth of the couple's second child.

Miller's husband Kevin left his statements in the comment section of an Instagram post made by Miller's employer, Shed Media, announcing her passing. In his message, the bereaved father said, “Lauren is truly the love of my life and I will miss her every moment of everyday.” He added, “She lives on through her children and we have peace knowing she is in heaven with God looking down on us and keeping us safe and filled with love.”

The announcement to which Miller's husband was replying stated that Lauren Miller “tragically passed away just moments after giving birth to her son, Jackson.” The post also called Miller “a valued member of the Shed team for nearly nine years” and commended her for her contributions to shows such as “The Real Housewives of New York,” “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City,” and “From Paris With Love.” The third slide in the post shows a photo of the family during Miller's pregnancy with Jackson.

Along with her husband and newborn son, the mother leaves behind a three-year-old daughter.

Although it was confirmed by Shed Media that Miller died moments after delivering her child, the exact complications that lead to the tragedy have not been publicly revealed.

A GoFundMe titled “Support for Lauren's Beloved Family,” which was created on behalf of her husband, gave a few more details on the situation, stating, “We are devastated for her beloved husband, Kevin, who must now unexpectedly take on the sole role of parenting their two children … Emma (3) and newborn Jackson, who is still in the NICU. That the day Lauren was so eagerly awaiting should end in tragedy is truly unfathomable.”

An update later revealed baby Jackson was released from the NICU on Thursday, June 12. The update thanked contributors for their support, saying, “As we cope with our own grief, it has been so incredibly touching to see how this fundraiser has spread.”

Lauren Miller is not the only notable media figure to recently die of complications from delivering a baby. In April 2024, NBC reported Instagram star and nursing influencer Hailey Okula, whose handle was @rnnewgrads, had died following the birth of her first child, a son named Crew. The influencer had almost half a million Instagram followers.

Okula's cause of death was an extremely rare delivery complication called “AFE,” which stands for amniotic fluid embolism. The condition occurs when them mother is allergic to her own amniotic fluid, per WebMD.

A few weeks after the loss, Okula's husband wrote in a tribute on Easter 2025, “I wish you were here to create the family memories we dreamed about together. I miss you more than words can capture and can't wait for the day I get to see you again. Thank you for being my everything. You always have been and always will be my beautiful angel.”

The top two singers on “American Idol” 2025 — winner Jamal Roberts and runner-up John Foster — continue to draw a crowd nearly a month after the season 23 finale. 

During a Facebook Live session on June 13, 2025, fresh off his performance with Kirk Franklin at the BET Awards, Roberts revealed, “I'm booked up until 2027. It happened that fast.”

In recent days, both singers have also sold out concerts, with more shows to come, proving that fans' excitement for them has not waned since the finale. 

A post shared by Jamal Roberts (@officialjamalroberts)

Roberts has a slew of shows confirmed in the coming weeks, including a concert at Nashville's City Winery on August 15, which sold out in less than 24 hours, according to his manager Carlton Cofield.

Roberts spent June 14 in Atmore, Alabama, with his two oldest daughters — Harmoni, 7, and Lyrik, 4 — headlining the Bee More Summer Festival. The mayor surprised the R&B singer with a key to the city. 

Roberts will soon head back to Los Angeles, he told fans during his June 13 Facebook Live session, to work on new music and future plans with his ever-expanding team. 

He marveled in a social media post on the same day about how much his life has changed over the last year, writing, “Nothing sitting here thinking about how my life was just a year ago and how fast God can change your situation if you trust Him. Whatever it is holding you back from getting to your full potential…HEAL FROM IT 🙏🏾💪🏾🥺✍🏿”

Classic country crooner Foster made his Grand Ole Opry debut on June 7, performing two songs — “How Great Thou Art” and  “Murder on Music Row.” The Louisiana native told the audience from the prestigious circle on Nashville's most famous stage, “Country music is the best thing to have ever happened to this world.” 

A week later, on June 14, he announced via Instagram that he's been invited back for two more shows, including one on his birthday and another with Opry member Jamey Johnson. 

“Playing the @opry was one of the biggest honors of my life,” Foster wrote. “Now, I have the pleasure of celebrating my 19th birthday there on July 9th! On top of that, I get to share the Opry stage with one of my favorite musicians, @jameyjohnsonofficial, on August 21st! If I don't say it enough, thank you, thank you, thank you for putting me here! ❤️”

On June 13, the day before Foster's Opry announcement, The Advocate reported that Foster's upcoming hometown concert in Baton Rouge, Louisiana — scheduled for August 2 at the 1,350-seat venue The Texas Club — had sold out in less than an hour. A second show has been added on August 1.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Jamal Roberts on Carrie Underwood Judging Controversy: ‘We Applaud Her'","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/jamal-roberts-comments-carrie-underwood-controversy/","Sun, 15 Jun 2025 04:13:03 GMT","

Nearly three weeks after Jamal Roberts won season 23 of “American Idol,” the R&B singer continues to be asked by media and fans about widespread speculation that judge Carrie Underwood wasn't thrilled about his rise to the top. 

Roberts has repeatedly taken the high road, giving Underwood the benefit of the doubt and insisting that the country star seemed supportive while he was on the show. But at the BET Awards 45th anniversary dinner on June 11, 2025, 27-year-old Roberts admitted to online journalist Nate Vinson that he knows he likely wasn't her favorite — and that he's proud of her for staying true to her “roots.”

A post shared by Carrie Underwood (@carrieunderwood)

In a clip Vinson tweeted of his interview with Roberts, he could be heard telling the “American Idol” winner, “There is a very strong narrative online about one of the judges of the show, Miss Carrie Underwood.” 

Roberts laughed, clearly unsurprised by getting another question about the supposed controversy, as Vinson continued, “People that watched the show felt like, you know, she really wasn't supportive of you like other judges, other people were of you. Have you seen any of that backlash and what is your response to that?”

“My response is Carrie is a country singer,” Roberts replied. “She likes country music. I mean, I don't think she likes every genre, for real. She had her picks, and she had to choose who she really liked, and she stuck with it. So, we applaud her for sticking to her roots and sticking to who she liked. But, you know, I feel like the better person won.”

Roberts beat out 19-year-old country crooner John Foster and 27-year-old contemporary Christian artist Breanna Nix for the top spot. 

Roberts' clip with Vinson drew lots of reactions on X. Some defended Underwood, others said she should have been more supportive, and a few neutral observers encouraged everyone to calm down and drop the drama. 

One tweeted, “Leave dude be and let him glow. Leave her be and let people actually express their opinions without (expletive) like this. Dude is super talented, but not my genre. Whatever. Congrats bro 💯💪👏”

The controversy stems from some of Roberts' supporters taking issue with Underwood's comments and expressions during the singer's season 23 performances. During his audition, for example, she said he needed more “swagger” to match his big voice. Later, after one of his top five performances, she said, “I feel like you missed such an opportunity to move around and entertain,” adding that it was time to “pull out all the stops.”

On May 30, a week after Roberts' victory, “The Morning Hustle” co-host Lore'l told Roberts that some viewers thought Underwood “kind of side-eyed you” after host Ryan Seacrest announced him as the winner. 

Roberts diplomatically replied, “Watching all the past performances, I see that she was clapping and getting on board, so I really don't know.”

“I didn't like her energy toward you,” Lore'l admitted, “and I think that's why I'm shading her in this interview here … is because I did not like the swagless comment, or saying that you needed swag, I did not like how she looked at you sometimes in some performances. I really wanted to come through the screen.”

Right after the finale ended, Underwood told Extra, “I do like the way it was set up, there was no way America could've gotten it wrong. We had three incredible finalists occupying three different lanes, they all had their own vibes, their own styles, their own vocal ranges and styles and techniques, and I feel like it was a great finale.” 

“But Jamal just has a gift from God,” she continued. “His voice is insane. Every time he opens his mouth, it's flawless … I got to tell him afterwards, ‘Now, go do great things!' And I feel like he certainly can.”

After she returned home to her farm near Nashville, Underwood named a baby sheep after Roberts that was born on the same day of the finale. She has since called the lamb “Baby J” in subsequent Instagram Stories.

Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard are “Severance” fans just like everybody else. They, however, have one advantage: Adam Scott‘s cell phone number. In Bell's Actors on Actors interview with Scott, the “Nobody Wants This” star made public exactly what she and her “Parenthood” husband leave in the text chain.

“The endings to every episode of ‘Severance' are so biologically frustrating that I don't know how you guys expect anyone to sleep after an episode with that level of a cliffhanger,” Bell started. “So what Dax and I tend to do is, when we see someone whose work we love or whose work frustrates us — as in your case — we leave you a nice, long, detailed, unedited voice memo. And you got a lot of those.”

Scott professed to have saved every one of the messages, calling them both “deeply flattering” and “deeply insulting.” While deep in production on the second season, one message from Bell and Shepard said, “Hey, just curious, are you guys shooting this one minute per week? Why is it taking so fucking long?” Scott teased, “Just because you guys left that message, it's now going to take seven years for the next season.”

 










Bell's favorite memo came when Shepard screamed out the message, “Hey, Adam. Kristen just fell out of a two-story window. I bet you'd like to know how she's doing. I'll tell you next week!”

Bell and Shepard are typical of the committed “Severance” fanbase, as Scott related to The Los Angeles Times in March.

“I was a huge ‘Lost' fan and huge ‘Twilight Zone' person, so I totally get it,” he said. “I don't really dive into all the theories and stuff on this, but I have seen some on Instagram, which is usually video of a podcast where they're really diving into one theory or the other. Also, all of the artwork that people are making, it's overwhelming and incredible. Whenever I see one on Instagram, I save every single one.”

Bell, Shepard, and the rest of the “Severance” heads will have to wait a while for the third season. While its production has been confirmed by executive producer Ben Stiller and Apple TV+, a date has yet to be announced.

Watch the full Actors on Actors conversation from Variety between Bell and Scott below:

It is possible to have too much of a good thing.

In the case of “Star Trek: Strange New Worlds” Season 3, reviewing the frothy, effortlessly watchable first five episodes brings this reviewer to that inescapable conclusion. This is the show that brought the fun back to “Star Trek,” that brought back the astronomical alchemy of Gene Roddenberry's “Original Series” and Rick Berman's '90s “Trek” series in a way most viewers thought they'd never see again. You could hold up a mirror to our society and have a lighthearted, pop-art-colored romp; you could inspire deep emotion alongside genuine thrills. 

 










Of that equation, though, the deep emotion is missing from Season 3 of “Strange New Worlds,” as is the mirror — even despite a character literally saying in one episode that sci-fi can make us look more closely at our own world.

All that's left is the fun. Hey, who are we to complain when it's a show this fun? But “Star Trek” always has had the capacity to be more, and so has this show: This very series has given us incredibly complex episodes discussing our own social moment (going so far as to say that 23rd century historians labeled the U.S. in the 2020s as in a “Second Civil War”), a riveting courtroom drama about personal freedom, and, in “Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow” one of the most soulful of all “Trek” episodes, one that truly turns Kirk into a romantic hero for the ages. 

 










Instead, in the first half of Season 3, “Strange New Worlds” opts to keep it surface-level.

The season picks up instantly after the last frames of the Season 2 cliffhanger, with a number of the Enterprise crew captured by the Gorn and the ship itself being swarmed by Gorn attack craft. The plot unfolds in an undeniably clever way — Season 3 continues to be smart, but is never quite thought-provoking — with a resolution to this story that feels very “Trek” and a lot of LED-wall CGI mush that feels sludgy and like any other TV production these days. A number of storylines are set up from these events related to ongoing physical and psychological trauma on account of the Gorn, for which your interest-level may vary.

The cast is uniformly stellar, as always. Anson Mount brings a texture and integrity to his Capt. Pike that puts him among the best “Star Trek” series leads ever. Previous “Trek” series did so much to establish that their leaders have lives beyond the captain's chair, have thoughts beyond their captain's log — Picard's love of classical music and Dixon Hill detective stories, Sisko's role as a father and his interest in his heritage and in archaeology, Archer's burning desire to watch “Rosemary's Baby” after literally saving Earth, Janeway's depression and inward turn during the “Night” episode of “Voyager” — and of all the “Trek” series since the franchise relaunched as a streaming property in 2017, Mount's Pike is the only one that really fits in their ranks. He brings so much more to the role than just the delivery of dialogue, finding gestures and expressive nuances that convey far beyond what could ever be on the page alone. His romantic relationship with Capt. Batel (Melanie Scrofano) is a particularly great way to further explore dimensions of both characters.

 










Babs Olusanmokun continues to bring dimension and depth, even coiled menace, as Dr. M'Benga, whose remarkable Season 2 episode that resulted in him pretty obviously flat-out murdering a Klingon war criminal is revisited quickly in Season 3. Jess Bush's Nurse Chapel is never less than riveting, somehow funny and earnest in the most perfect “Trek” way. Christina Chong's La'an is one of the great humor-by-way-of-repression characters the franchise has ever given us. 

And under Ethan Peck's extraordinary steering of the character, Spock has become all but a Jane Austen hero, someone whose rigid control of their emotions and adherence to the strictest code of conduct corrals a barely-contained sensuality. He's the “Pride and Prejudice” hand-flex as a full-fledged character. (One can't even imagine Leonard Nimoy doing a better job delivering the line “I do not require a Bacchanale.”) So much of this show is now about his romantic pursuits, or those pursuing him, and it works.

Spending time with these characters feels like spending time with friends. What's lacking are really meaningful storylines to put them into, culminating in a very dispiriting episode that features zombies. “Star Trek” does not, now or ever, need zombies. An “escape room” archaeological dig episode isn't vastly better either.

 










The one absolute triumph of an episode is the one that goes all-out in just being a lark: “Trek” should probably have its “lark” episodes and then more serious episodes, giving us a variety of tones while keeping them distinct. This particular “lark” episode, directed masterfully as always by Jonathan Frakes, involves the Enterprise testing out a holodeck (not a spoiler, its distinctive grid pattern was seen in the official teaser) via an Agatha Christie-style whodunnit that La'an has to solve. 

But it's not just a Christie-style mystery, it's one set in 1960s Hollywood and about a murder on the set of a space adventure show that's basically just a redressed “Original Series,” with “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” style abounding. It's an absolute blast, and it reminds that through these first five episodes we don't get nearly enough of Rebecca Romijn as first officer Number One or Celia Rose Gooding's Uhura. This show has always been good at spreading the wealth, so it's likely they'll get their moments before Season 3 wraps. And wait till you see who Mount is playing in that holodeck episode.

That installment is great, but even still, hanging over all five of these episodes is a whiff of “what is this show about now?” The relative lack of substance across the board can't help feeling like a cop out for a show that's been capable of a lot more. God forbid the avoidance of anything topical is another expression of Paramount looking to avoid any potential confrontations ahead of its proposed merger with Skydance. It may not be that, but it's starting to look like the decision to wrap the series after a six-episode fifth season shoots later this year is a good one. 

 










After the five episodes we've screened of Season 3, there are likely only 21 episodes left. Let's hope, with a real plan, showrunners Akiva Goldsman and Henry Alonso Myers can truly make them count.

“Star Trek: Strange New Worlds” Season 3 premiered at the 2025 Tribeca Festival. It will stream on Paramount+ starting July 17, releasing a new episode each week.

Fresh off the success of “Materialists,” Chris Evans is letting his fellow Marvel stalwart Sebastian Stan know that he's ready to take to the stage, which Stan apparently has been telling Evans he wants to do for years. Evans, though, doubts that the “Thunderbolts*” actor is serious.

“He can say that all day, but when I really call him on it — I'm like, ‘Let's do it. Which one?' He's like, ‘Well, you know, I'm a little busy.' I'm like, ‘Seb, stop using me in press. Because I'm ready to get on stage with you,'” Evans told Entertainment Weekly. “But, you know, he's a busy guy. He's an Oscar nominee. He's got stuff going on.”

But Evans is insistent that he is “dying to get on stage,” specifically with Stan, who has performed on Broadway in “Picnic” (2013) and “Talk Radio (2007).

“I love Seb. I love working with him,” Evans continued. “Theater's such a massive commitment. You're with the person all day every day. So I would… kill to do it.”

This is not the first time Evans has heaped praise on his “Captain America” co-star. He talked to Vanity Fair earlier this year about Stan's bold career choices, which included a 2024 that saw him in such diverse films as “The Apprentice” and “A Different Man” — both of which led to critical acclaim and a bevy of awards attention.

 










“Sebastian has always been really fearless. You can see that in his choices. He takes big swings. When that Trump movie was kicking around, I remember thinking, ‘I wonder who is going to take this job? It's just got so many strings attached to it.' And I was so unsurprised when I heard it was Sebastian,” Evans said.

And though the star is known for his screen roles, the endurance tests of the MCU may come in handy should he ever grace the Broadway stage.

“They are these big, giant movies. There's a lot of cooks in the kitchen. But the empirical evidence is in: They are not easy to make. If it was easier, there would be a lot more good ones,” Evans said at Emerald City Comic Con in 2024.

Stan is returning to the MCU for “Avengers: Doomsday,” which is currently in production with a release date set for December 18, 2026. Evans' “Materialists” is in theaters now.

In May 1970, Chrissie Hynde, who then went by Chris, was an 18-year-old student at Kent State University who believed the Vietnam War was an untenable moral abomination. The state of Ohio could run conservative, but Kent State was a hotbed of subversive art and revolutionary mobilization. The Students for a Democratic Society had staged controversial on-campus actions in '1968 and '69, and in the days after Nixon announced his invasion of Cambodia, someone— presumably protestors—set fire to the college ROTC.

This turned out to be a terrible idea. Following a confrontation between police and local protesters, the Ohio governor called in the National Guard, also composed almost entirely of twentysomethings, who were not trained in how to keep over a thousand hippies from running roughshod over their own campus. When the protestors kept coming, the National Guard unleashed teargas canisters, creating a stampede. As Hynde recollects in her 2015 memoir Reckless: My Life as a Pretender, “It was a no-win situation. If you fell over, you'd be trampled underfoot.”

The next day, things got worse. Protesters screamed epithets and threw rocks. Some Guardsmen got spooked and fired on the crowd. Chris Hynde was protesting on the other side of campus, so it wasn't until shortly after that she learned her friend's boyfriend, Jeff Miller, was one of the four dead that day outside Prentice Hall. All over America, for the previous several years, the fabric of the nation had been fraying, but here was something different: white college kids, thought to be a protected class, slaughtered on their own middle-American campus. Hynde described the pathetic confusion of the immediate aftermath of the shootings: “The Guardsmen themselves looked stunned. They were still surrounding the burned-down building. What had they been guarding? There was nothing to protect; the ROTC building was gone now. …We looked at them and they looked at us… There was a sense of incomprehension.”

Up to this point, Hynde had been a rebel, a troublemaker, and a party girl, suspicious of authority and attracted to notions of social justice that had the added benefit of annoying her straitlaced parents. Now she was a radical, the kind of person who would one day offer the following testimony in her greatest song: “Well, I'll die as I stand here today/Knowing that deep in my heart/They'll fall to ruin one day/For making us part.”

What kind of radical Hynde became is a complicated question—indeed, the enigmatic fulcrum of her remarkable American life. After Kent State, Neil Young would write the incendiary “Ohio,” an elegy but also a warning: “Tin soldiers and Nixon's coming/We're finally on our own.” It was the best song written about Ohio in the '70s. Hynde, desperately trying to shrug off the trauma of the shootings, allowed in her frequently beautiful but emotionally circumscribed memoir that Young's song “made us feel better.” Fourteen years after the massacre, she would write the best song about Ohio in the '80s.

By 1984, Hynde was a minted rock star facing her Rubicon. The run-up to her success reads like a peculiar but well-plotted biopic. She briefly collaborates with Devo's Mark Mothersbaugh at Kent State, then gets herself over to England, where punk rock is just taking off. The great songs that she always imagined began to pour forth like warm pub ale. She gets a gig writing for the NME—that's when she becomes Chrissie. She forms the killer band the Pretenders, whose very first single, produced by Nick Lowe—a glorious cover of the Kinks' “Stop Your Sobbing”—is a shot across the bow signaling an incandescent new talent on the scene. The first two Pretenders albums are tours de force of punk, pop, soul, glam, and art rock that establish Hynde as a new archetype in popular music, although the shadows of her antecedents (Patti Smith, Linda Ronstadt) can be seen in her outline.

Filled with unimpeachable classics, 1980's Pretenders and 1981's Pretenders II were commercial hits and critical fetish items. Then came the double-hammer blows of 1982 and early 1983, when her bandmates, guitarist James Honeyman-Scott and bassist Pete Farndon, died of drug overdoses in rapid succession. Make that a triple: In 1983, Hynde gave birth to her first daughter.

Two polarities define Hynde's work. One is an intuitive, if sublimated, strand of compassion, which had been recently stirred by her stature as a new mother. The other is a thorough cynicism inculcating her with a belief that she was living through times of almost limitless avarice and corruption—“a world in decline.” Learning to Crawl is a desperate attempt to integrate these two worldviews.

The album was recorded over two sessions in 1982 and 1983 with the legendary Roxy Music and Sex Pistols producer Chris Thomas at the helm, who had also been on the boards for the first two LPs. Hynde needed new people, obviously, and she recruited some of the absolute best. Billy Bremner, formerly of Rockpile and guesting on guitar, plays a fair share of the record's moving instrumentation. The birth of the baby, the sudden introduction of whole new players. It is a tribute to her genius that everything musically moved forward despite the disruption. No one would have been remotely surprised if Learning to Crawl had been a steep drop off from its estimable predecessors. No one could have known how down to the bone it would go.

It is difficult to reconcile Learning to Crawl's boundless, full-hearted prayer for compassion with the churlish, even cold-hearted, version of Hynde portrayed in James Henke's April 26, 1984, Rolling Stone profile of the Pretenders, in which she refuses to go so far as to characterize the loss of her bandmates as a tragedy. The article is called “Chrissie Hynde Without Tears.” It is possible that the magazine was just going for something sensationalistic, but that's not how it reads to me. In response to Henke offering up the recent Rolling Stone review that described Learning to Crawl as “a triumph of art over adversity,” Hynde quickly snapped back: “I hate this sort of romantic or sentimental take people have on it—you know, the tragic demise, the reawakening. I even regret naming the album Learning to Crawl, because it just sounds pathetic. I mean, I'm not sentimental.”

This is one of Learning to Crawl's great themes: Life's events, its catastrophes and joys, are plotted with such absolute randomness that everyone should at any moment be prepared for the worst. Echoing both John Lennon's “The Word” and “Beautiful Boy” in “Show Me,” a profoundly touching paean to her infant daughter, she seeds the future with the following fine how-do-you-do: “Welcome to the human race/With its wars/Disease/And brutality.”

On the topic of Pete Farndon's death, Hynde is bordering on cruel. “The guy blew it,” she told Rolling Stone. “He shot up a speedball and drowned in the bath. It's not really my idea of a beautiful rock and roll image: the tattooed arm, hanging out of the tub, turning blue, with a syringe stuck in it. But that's what it came to in the end.” There are many plausible explanations for the eviscerating harshness of her tone in that moment: the impotent rage of losing someone to addiction, the towering anger of being left behind to pick up the pieces. But the whiplash from kindness to cruelty is a feature of each of the Pretenders' classic first three records, none more so than Learning to Crawl.

The rock'n'roll tradition is filled with no shortage of requiems. Like AC/DC's Back in Black, recorded after the death of Bon Scott, the death-addled Learning to Crawl kicks out the jams right away. The first two songs are mirror images of rage and vituperation cut through with something approaching a transcendent feeling of cosmic love. With its indelible guitar riff and brutal critique of music-business misogyny, “Middle of the Road” is a subversive masterwork. Slithering with scene-setting menace, it rides its killer riff and equal-opportunity insult machine into four minutes and 15 seconds of glorious garage rock. “I'm not the cat I used to be,” she admits; “I got a kid/I'm 33.” Still, a cat is a cat, and the song is a challenge—to the label managers, the landed gentry, anyone who might try to wield their power over her in some unseemly way. “Come on, baby,” she hisses. “Get in the road.”

Like funeral chimes, Hynde's beautiful 12-string chords and Bremmer's lyrical opening riff rip off the bandage and open the floodgates on Hynde's eternal soul anthem “Back on the Chain Gang,” a perfect song. “I found a picture of you,” she begins. “Those were the happiest days of my life.” From the Cure to Ringo Starr to Def Leppard to J. Geils, there are many great songs about photographs, but perhaps none quite so transporting. “Circumstance beyond our control,” Hynde allows, a significant admission for a consummate control freak.

With its marvelous and unexpected commingling of Byrdsy, West Coast jangle and deep Southern soul, “Back on the Chain Gang” genuflects towards Sam Cooke's 1960 mesmerizing classic “Chain Gang” while simultaneously grafting onto it a lifetime's worth of feminine perspective: the exploitative businesspeople, the handsy men, the abusive political structures. Hynde's voice, never less than an extraordinary instrument, is heavenly here, paradoxically achieving a sound tougher than steel wool and fragile as stained glass. It strains against the bondage of her circumstances before finally soaring free of it all. It fights with every breath in her body.

And with that, the flies disperse. Following the emotional bloodletting of the first two songs, Learning to Crawl wrestles with the thorny problem of what to do next. The Gang of Four-style “Time the Avenger” furthers the us-against-them stakes with a fury verging on the apocalyptic, casting one powerful man after the next into the same ironic hell: “With your girls/And desk and leather chairs/Thought that time was on your side.” Then there's “My City Was Gone,” a great and complicated American song. Amid the caustic rave-ups, the crushing ballads, the art-rock explorations, the Pretenders had always been a little funky too. With its strutting groove and Booker T. & the M.G.'s-worthy bass hook, this would be the funkiest they would ever get.

Hynde was born into a middle-class family in Akron, Ohio, in 1951. These were the high-Caesar years for the American Rust Belt, and Akron was America's undisputed rubber capital, home to B.F. Goodrich, Firestone, Goodyear, General—pretty much all of them. This was the beating heart of the industrial Midwest, yielding a pungent memory in Hynde's memoir: “When you walked down Main Street in Akron you either caught the fragrant whiff of rolled oats from the silos at the Quaker Oats factory, or the acrid smell from one of the rubber factories.” What's indelible about “My City Was Gone” is its perfect capture of what was truly happening in 1983—the invasion of chain stores into previously untouched regions, the slow-growing specter of corporate welfare, local downtowns rent asunder under intolerable economic weight. She's been away for a while. She's absolutely baffled. Imagine coming from an actual place and then returning to a geographic nullity. Released a year ahead of Bruce Springsteen's equally revelatory song on the same topic, “My Hometown,” Hynde's verdict twists the knife in the cruelest possible Midwestern way, inverting the Ohio State football team's iconic “Buckeye Battle Cry” with the raised-eye suggestion: “Ay, oh/Way to go/Ohio” To paraphrase John Jeremiah Sullivan paraphrasing Joan Didion: She's not saying there's no there there. She's saying there's no there.

It is no great demerit to state that Learning to Crawl is an album defined by its raft of standards, a degree of highest-level songwriting that for every understandable reason cannot be fully maintained over its 40-minute runtime. There's nothing wrong with the cheerfully bratty ramble of “Thumbelina” or the pulverizing, reggae-adjacent “I Hurt You”; they would be standout tracks on a lesser LP and suffer only by comparison with the bona fide classics in the running order. Similarly, a stately cover of the Persuaders' 1971 estrangement anthem “Thin Line Between Love and Hate” is useful insofar as it reveals one of her inspirations for the LP, but the Pretenders' faithful reading does little to improve upon the original. Still, it fits both the mood and the theme of a record about love, alienation, and the thrills and consequences of coloring outside the lines.

With its surfeit of runaway hooks, its working-class rage, its ad-hoc penchant for insult comedy, and its communion with the idea of genuine human understanding, the dissociative classic that Learning to Crawl ultimately resembles most is John Lennon's Imagine. How do you metabolize all this love and death? The crowded cityscapes and backwards contradictions of rock stardom are endless. How do you sleep? Any way you can.

Hynde is not an easy person to understand. Short of an abiding solidarity with underdogs of every stripe, she seems disinclined towards political orthodoxies, other than her long-standing status as a vegetarian and animal-rights activist. To wit: “My City Was Gone” was the interminably long-running theme song for the late Rush Limbaugh's 40-year struggle against common decency. It's said she made a deal with him, possibly involving PETA. Joe Strummer she is not.

By the time of Learning to Crawl, she had seen two counter-culture revolutions fail spectacularly, first as the hippie dream of her teenage years, and then the punk-rock scene in London. And for all her vaunted wildness, you don't have to squint hard to perceive a strain of small-c conservatism in much of her work—the prizing of personal responsibility over what she might well view as sentimental coddling and the inevitable karmic comeuppance for the persistently overindulged. The lessons of Kent State, and of the loss of her bandmates, seem to be at its core: No one is coming to help. The world is chaotic and cruel, ruled by a top-down hierarchy of malevolent actors and unreconstructed bullies. The essence of her radicalism is the twinned, overlapping, and occasionally contradictory refusal to bend her principles in the face of impossible odds, and the enduring belief that love is the only engine of survival.

Perhaps that's why Learning to Crawl concludes with “2000 Miles,” an act of explicit mercy. Twelve-strings chime, and the effervescent feeling of winter renewal announces the song as a shadowy holiday classic. Picture this: A rock star walks down the bustling middle of the road, holding her young daughter's hand. “He's gone,” she explains in a conciliatory tone. Who knows exactly who she could mean. Sure enough, outside, it's Christmas Day.

	Internet trolls are making a mockery of Donald Trump‘s beloved military parade that took place Saturday in Washington, D.C., on the president's birthday, though it was ostensibly in honor of the U.S. Army's 250th birthday. 


	Accounts on X (formerly Twitter) shared video of other countries' military parades with soldiers marching in synchronized lockstep surrounded by enthusiastic and large crowds, comparing them to the spectacle in D.C. on Saturday.


	One account, which Puck News' Julia Ioffe identified as Russian, juxtaposed footage of members of the North Korean military marching in exact sync, comparing it to video of U.S. Army troops marching in Trump's parade accompanied by much less fanfare. 


	“How Trump imagined his parade [vs] What he actually saw,” the caption read, according to Ioffe. The contrast is staggering, as the North Korean troops high-stepped in perfect unison compared to the Army's less synchronized and seemingly less enthusiastic marching. Some have pointed out that members of the U.S. Army may have been ordered to march in “Route Step March” or “At Ease March,” a more relaxed and less rigorous type of marching.

	One account posted video of Mexico's annual Mexican Independence Day parade in Mexico City, while another shared footage of India's Republic Day parade.

	Trump has praised other countries for their military parades. When he watched a 2017 Bastille Day celebration in France, Trump told reporters, “It was one of the greatest parades I've ever seen… We're going to have to try to top it.”

	











Washington Post columnist Karen Tumulty pointed out that Trump's admiration of military spectacle goes even farther back. Before he was inaugurated to his first term, Trump told Tumulty in an interview, “We're going to show the people as we build up our military, we're going to display our military.” 


	“That military may come marching down Pennsylvania Avenue,” Trump continued. “That military may be flying over New York City and Washington, D.C., for parades. I mean, we're going to be showing our military.”

	Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said called the parade “a vulgar display” during a news conference on Friday. “It's the kind of thing you see Kim Jong Un, you see Putin, you see with dictators around the world that are weak,” he said.


	Meanwhile, as Trump was celebrating his the Army's birthday in D.C., which reportedly cost up to $45 million, masses of people that dwarfed the parade turnout showed up across the country for No Kings protests against him. An estimated 5 million people participated in protests across 2,100 cities in the U.S. while troops in D.C. marched past sometimes empty stands.

Pussy Riot showed solidarity on “No Kings” Day, participating in the march in Los Angeles on Saturday. They joined the demonstration while displaying a red banner that read, “It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Russia.”


	The march in downtown Los Angeles drew about 20,000 people, and was one of 2,000 locations that held “No Kings” Day protests against the president, who has deployed the National Guard and the Marines to L.A. over protests opposing his administration's aggressive raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The protests were held on the same day Trump threw an expensive military parade on his 79th birthday in Washington, D.C.


	Pussy Riot co-founder Nadya Tolokonnikova's “Police State” installation at the Geffen Contemporary at MOCA was postponed Sunday, when the National Guard was deployed. “Due to evolving conditions in downtown Los Angeles and the proximity of The Geffen Contemporary at MOCA to ongoing demonstrations and military activity near the Los Angeles Federal Detention Facility, the museum has made the decision to adjust its operating hours and event schedule out of concern for the safety of staff and visitors,” MOCA said on its website. The 10-day exhibit was originally set to conclude tomorrow, with a panel and performance of Siberia. The rescheduled dates have not yet been released.

	In a statement regarding Pussy Riot's participation in the “No Kings” march, Tolokonnikova reflected on Russia and the current state of the world in relation to her exhibit. “It's not quite a penal colony here, but a halfway house,” she said. “Once again, when I write a statement or a song, a demon on my left shoulder is whispering: ‘How much is too much? Will this get you jailed or not quite yet??' The answer is – idfk. When the law is being used not to protect freedoms, put to punish – selectively and voluntarily – those who speak out, no lawyer can tell you what's safe, and what's not. As my Russian lawyer used to say, “Nadya, stop asking me what's safe – if you want to be safe, leave Russia.”

	Tolokonnikova said that she refused to leave her home country, until she realized “If I stayed, I'd spend the rest of my life behind bars.” She added that Russian President Vladimir Putin promised “safety and stability” and instead is “waging the bloodiest war in modern Europe.”


	“It's beginning to feel a lot like Russia…. Everywhere you go,” she continued.

	“My job as an artist is to interpret those feelings. I felt that tingle for a bit now, that is why I did the POLICE STATE exhibit,” she said. “The walls are closing, the camera systems are getting AI upgrades, you have to censor what you say or unidentified masked men will show up at your home, at your work, at your church. One day, leaving the museum, I stepped into an actual police state – rows of police assaulting peaceful protesters.”


	“I guess you could say it's my first artistic collaboration with the United States Military,” she concluded. “Now we are on the street protesting alongside people who believe immigrants make America great.”

	Bryan Bedford, Donald Trump‘s nominee to lead the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), has misled the public, claiming to have a “commercial” pilot license that he does not hold, Politico reported.


	Bedford, who serves as president and CEO of Republic Airways, was listed on the airline's website as holding “commercial, multi-engine and instrument pilot ratings” as recently as Thursday, according to Politico. But after the outlet inquired about Bedford's credentials, the airline removed “commercial” from the webpage on Friday, the publication reported.


	According to Politico, Bedford does not have a commercial pilot's license listed in the FAA registry. But Bedford has claimed since at least 2010 to have that kind of license according to the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine records of Republic Airways' website.


	Bedford does have a private pilot's license, including credentials that he can fly multi-engine planes and fly in bad weather and at nighttime.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The Department of Transportation (DOT) told Politico that Bedford has passed “written and oral exams” to fly commercial aircraft. The department additionally said that Bedford had not “personally nor publicly claimed to be a commercial airline pilot.”

	











	“Bryan never misrepresented his credential; it was an administrative error that was immediately corrected,” DOT said in a statement.


	As Politico noted, The Air Current in an April 2025 article about Bedford also pointed out that the CEO is not a commercial pilot. “Bedford is a pilot himself, although not a commercial pilot, as he has sometimes claimed to be,” The Air Current wrote.

	











	Given recent events, including the Jan. 2025 collision between a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter and American Airlines Flight 5342 over the Potomac River near Washington-Reagan National Airport that killed 67 people, many are looking to the FAA to improve the air traffic control system. Elon Musk, while leading the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, tried to lay off swaths of air traffic controllers but was stopped by the DOT. Trump blamed diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices for the crash.


	Bedford faced questioning last week from the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee as part of his nomination process. Members of the committee grilled him about how his company tried (and failed) to certify pilots who only met half of the federally required flight hours.


	When questioned by Sen. Tammy Duckworth about whether he would keep the number of required hours to 1,500, Bedford would not give a straight answer.

	“It doesn't sound like a yes,” Duckworth said. “It sounds like you're leaving the door open to reduce the number of flight hours below 1,500.”


	“What I'm saying is I don't believe safety is static,” Bedford responded.

Follow all of our Sean Combs trial coverage


	The fifth week of Sean Combs' sex trafficking and racketeering trial revolved around testimony from the hip-hop mogul's recent ex-girlfriend, who acknowledged that while she still loved Combs, she was still processing the “trauma” that came from their three-and-a-half-year relationship. 


	Testifying under the pseudonym “Jane,” the single mother said what began as a whirlwind romance with Combs in January 2021, bolstered by cute nicknames, a lavish trip to Turks and Caicos, and rapid declarations of love, deteriorated into “nightmares” by Combs' arrest last September. 


	Considered Victim-2 in Southern District of New York's case against the 55-year-old, Jane said after a few months of indulging in what she believed was harmless “fantasy talk” about being intimate with another man in front of Combs quickly spun out of control. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“I truly felt that that night just opened like a Pandora's box in our relationship. It just completely set the tone for our relationship moving forward,” Jane testified during her first day on the stand. “It was just a door that I was unable to shut for the remainder of the relationship.” 


	From May 2021 onwards, Jane claimed she felt obligated to “perform” in ecstasy-fueled sex marathons with multiple male escorts as Combs watched. Even when Jane said she began to push back on what she knew as “hotel nights,” saying she was “not a porn star” and that she had “hit a wall,” Combs allegedly continued to push her into the sexual encounters. 

	











	Throughout her six days on the stand — the longest of any witness, including Combs' longtime ex-girlfriend Casandra “Cassie” Ventura — Jane sobbed as she recounted her experience. She grew testy when cross-examined by Combs' defense attorney, Teny Geragos, who suggested Jane's anger was fueled by jealousy over Combs spending time with his other girlfriends, gifting them designer purses, and taking them on luxurious island trips.  

	











	“How much does my body cost?” an upset Jane shot back at Geragos after she asked how much a Bottega Veneta handbag that Combs had given her cost. But by the time Jane left the stand Friday afternoon, she hugged both Geragos and Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey. 


	Amid Jane's testimony, there was heightened excitement around what was happening outside the courtroom, with an appearance from Kanye West, online sleuths spotting a surprise connection to Britney Spears, and ongoing discussion of the removal of a juror, which could impact the jury's verdict.

	Here are the key moments from the trial's second week: 


Will Juror Number Six Be Dismissed? 


	A juror's offhand, friendly comment to court staff sent both parties into a tailspin this week, as they debated whether the juror could continue serving due to uncertainty over his jurisdictional qualifications and inconsistencies with his statements. 


	The 41-year-old male corrections officer had casually mentioned that he recently moved to New Jersey to live with his girlfriend, which would have invalidated his ability to serve on a New York jury. When brought to the court's attention, U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian called the juror in for clarification, where the man said, “[the move] may not be permanent, but that is where I've been staying for the last couple of weeks.” 


	After a long break where both prosecutors and Combs' defense counsel deliberated, the juror was pressed further on his residency.

	Subramanian said the inconsistencies about where he lived and who he lived with could challenge the integrity of the proceeding. “The concern, even if we were to hear from the juror and have some explanation to reconcile the different answers, is that there would be an appearance and a reasonable perception that the process may have been tainted; that there may be a juror on the jury who has an agenda, who wants to be here and is not going to be either able or willing to follow the rules,” Subramanian said. 


	Subramanian said the juror would be removed and told not to return on Monday. But Combs' attorney, Xavier Donaldson, made an impassioned plea to reconsider and allow the juror the chance to clear up the confusion. Donaldson noted this jury is exceptionally diverse and removing juror six, who is Black, would be “in my opinion, going backward.” 

	











	Subramanian said he'd take the request under consideration and let the parties know if anything on his stance had changed.


Kanye West and a Britney Spears Crossover


	After a few days of rampant rumors swirling around a certain rapper making an appearance at the trial, Kanye West strode into the Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse on Friday morning. Dressed in all-white denim, Combs' youngest son, Christian, greeted the rapper and whisked him away to a little-used room that streamed the day's proceedings. 


	The 48-year-old, who has been embroiled in his own controversy for the past few years, watched a few minutes of Combs' former assistant testifying about setting up for “King Nights.” As word quickly spread of his arrival and spectators flocked to the room, West motioned to Christian that he was ready to leave. Within an hour, West had arrived and left the building. 


	West wasn't the only celebrity name mentioned this week. Britney Spears was inadvertently brought into the discourse after it was revealed that Combs' business accountant is Robin Greenhill, an executive at the same management team that worked with Spears during her controversial conservatorship from 2008 to 2021. 


	Spears accused the company, Tri-Star, and Greenhill of working with her father, Jamie, to control and monitor her. Greenhill was accused of “spying” on the singer and allegedly routinely declining Spears' requests for harmless purchases, such as sushi for dinner, despite the superstar having a net worth of around $60 million. 


	Greenhill's name first popped up in Jane's testimony. Following a fight, Combs offered Jane a “love contract,” agreeing to give her a $10,000 monthly allowance, which she used on rent. Jurors were shown an email from Greenhill to Jane's landlord in May 2023, confirming a wire transfer for rent. 


	Combs' former assistant, Jonathan Perez, also mentioned Greenhill in his testimony on Friday, stating that he submitted reimbursement invoices to Tri Star and acknowledged that Greenhill was in charge of releasing funds to Combs and certain members of his team. 


The Messages About $1 Million Jurors Won't See












	As the government prepares to wrap up their case next week, they attempted to insert some eyebrow-raising text messages. One exchange took place among Combs, his longtime friend and security member D-Roc, and Faheem Muhammad, another security guard whom the government described as the CFO of Combs' finances. Combs wanted Muhammad to go into his personal safe and count out $1,137,000 in cash by hand. “This is about the defendant's access to the cash that is used to facilitate his criminal conduct and his co-conspirators' awareness of that and their role in securing that cash,” Assistant United States Attorney Christy Slavik argued.


	Prosecutors also highlighted another conversation between Combs and his former head of security, whom staffers referred to as Uncle Paulie, in October 2015. Paulie sent Combs a dire warning about an apparent violent episode between Combs and his girlfriend Gina while the trio were in Atlanta. (Photos show Combs was in town to host the BET Hip Hop Awards Afterparty.) 


	“If anyone called the police, the police is a hundred percent going to lock you,” the lengthy text message from Paulie said in part. “Even if she begs them not to, it's the law. So once they put the cuffs on you, your life and career is over. Puff, really all over her. Puff, really, your family is going to go down the hill.”


	However, the judge ruled neither exchange could be entered as evidence, saying the $1 million cash conversation was too prejudicial, while the Gina message lacked context and the necessary foundation to be shown to the jury.


“Ain't Nobody Threatening You”: Combs' Voice Notes to Jane 


	Prosecutors played several voice notes that Combs sent to Jane in the aftermath of her backing out of a “freak-off” with several male escorts she'd suggested to Combs during an ecstasy-induced night of “fantasy talk.” After Jane canceled on him, Combs became furious, unleashing a stream of expletives at Jane and accusing her of playing “games.” 


	In the days following the fight, with several messages exchanged between the pair, Combs sent Jane a voice note in August 2023. “Hey, I really don't know what's going on with you, but I just wanted to give you a heads up that I'm really about to disappear on you, you feel me?” Combs casually says. “I'm not going to be playing these games with you. At all. I don't know — you think you silent treating me? And you think I'm a be — nah. You'll have a rude awakening. You'll just have silence. Ain't nobody threatening you.”


	Combs later adds, “Me and you can be mad, we can have a spat, we can have whatever, and then after that — you better get on your job. That's all it is. You got me on my job.”

	











	When asked what Combs meant when he warned that Jane better get on her “job,” she said that she understood Combs was referring to his expectation that she continue participating in marathon sex sessions with male entertainers. 


	On Combs' end, Jane said the mogul's mention of him being on his “job” was a swipe at her for “taking care of me financially.” Earlier that year, Combs agreed to pay Jane a monthly allowance of $10,000 as part of a “love contract.” This voice note, Jane and prosecutors alleged, was part of a larger pattern of Combs constantly bringing up his financial support whenever they fought.


Combs Allegedly Attacks Jane Weeks After Saying He Was “Committed to Being a Better Man”


	On May 17, 2024, Jane was lying in bed with Combs at his Miami mansion when one of his sons knocked on his door, alerting him to a crisis: CNN had just published a surveillance video of him attacking Ventura at the InterContinental Hotel in 2016.  


	Jane said she watched as Combs and his team quickly strategized and crafted an apology statement. “I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now,” Combs said in the since-deleted social media post. “I went, and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I'm so sorry. But I'm committed to be a better man each and every day. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm truly sorry.”


	But just a few weeks later, on June 18, 2024, Jane said she experienced similar violence. During what was supposed to be a romantic dinner at Jane's home in Los Angeles, Combs allegedly flew into a rage after Jane confronted him with her suspicions that he had been on vacation with another woman. 


	After Jane shoved Combs' head into a marble countertop and threw glass items at him, Combs chased her through the house, kicking down four locked doors. He allegedly punched her repeatedly in the head, kicked her as she curled up in a ball, and dragged Jane into the home by her hair before lifting her by the neck in a chokehold. He then allegedly forced Jane to participate in a freak-off that night. 


The Week Ahead 


	After more than two dozen witnesses, prosecutors said they expect to rest their case next week. Their final witnesses are three summary witnesses, a law enforcement official, and Combs' former personal assistant, Brendan Paul.

	Paul was the lone person arrested during the simultaneous raids on Combs' homes in March 2024. As Combs boarded a private plane bound for the Caribbean with his daughters and entourage, police said they found drugs in Pauk's baggage. (Testimony from former assistants said they were expected to travel with an array of illicit substances for Combs.) Paul's case was ultimately dismissed after he completed a drug diversion course. 

	











	The defense said they expect to bring their own witnesses to the stand as soon as Friday. They have not made public who they expect to call.

							By 

	Jason Newman



	Is John C. Reilly the lovelorn antidote to a troubled, chaotic world?


	At New York's Cafe Carlyle Friday night, the Oscar- and Grammy-nominated actor reprised perhaps his most sentimental role: Mister Romantic, a nostalgic crooner who wears his heart on his sleeve — sometimes literally — to belt standards and try, effortlessly yet fruitlessly, to find eternal love.


	The three-night residency celebrated Friday's release of What's Not to Love?, Reilly's debut album that's a surprisingly faithful appreciation of the Great American Songbook. You'd be forgiven for thinking the Walk Hard star would offer a fractured take on cherished standards like “Dream” and “Moonlight Serenade.” But the man behind Dewey Cox also took on Mister Cellophane, with Reilly's earnest vision of Mister Romantic taking center stage.


	“I looked at our weary world a few years ago and tried to think of a way I could spread love and empathy,” he said in a statement accompanying the album. “I decided the most fun way to do that was through performing and singing and telling people I loved them.” 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Reilly takes thinking outside the box literally to start the show, as a steamer trunk near the stage opens to reveal the actor in a vaudeville-era suit and suspenders, clown-inspired makeup (Reilly studied clowning as a kid and considered being one professionally after acting school) and very vertical hair.


	“I don't have to go back into the box if I can find one person who can love me forever,” he told the crowd. “And that's the hard part.”

	











	“The show is designed so that I fail so that you feel better about yourself,” Reilly half-joked this week on The Late Show, adding, “like any good clown.”


	The nostalgic, supper club vibe of the Carlyle – dressed-up guests supped lobster bisque and ate steak frites and foie pâté while downing cocktails with ingredients like “dry gypsophilia”  – was a perfect setting for the show, which drew from jazz, cabaret, pantomime and Reilly's genial storytelling. As Mister Romantic gets romantically shot down by audience members again and again, it's hard not to rush the stage to give him a hug.

	“The show was born out of despair as much as joy,” Reilly recently told the New York Times. “Because I was looking around at the world — and this has only gotten worse since we started this project, unfortunately — thinking, what in the hell is going on? How could people be so lacking in empathy? I wish it wasn't political to say that love is worth trying, but it is, for some reason, in this world. It's a strange time to have to defend empathy. Empathy is the foundation of civilization.”


	Pagliacci would've loved the show — “I'm not gay or straight,” Mister Romantic tells one male audience member. “I'm just desperate” — and Reilly masterfully weaves between humor and pathos and back again. “I don't know how to do most things about love,” Mister Romantic says at one point. “I'm hoping you can all teach me.”


	But for all its funny parts, the show highlights Reilly's mellifluous croon, honed from an upbringing performing musical theatre. A gorgeous, commanding take on “My Funny Valentine” leaves the crowd speechless, as do covers of Tom Waits' “Picture in a Frame” and “Are You Lonesome Tonight?” (The latter sees Reilly comically ripping his heart out and burying it.) With all the vaudevillian touches, it's not surprising that wry, poetic artists like Waits and Jonathan Richman helped inspire the character. 


	But romance is, in the end, everywhere. Reilly's mic is covered with roses. He throws rose petals on an audience member's head while crooning “Mona Lisa” to her. (“Will you love me forever?” he asks. Her reply: “I'm afraid not.”) He rubs noses with the crowd. He does a 60-year-old man version of Magic Mike to “Dream a Little Dream.”

	“It might sound Pollyanna-ish,” he told the Times, “but it really was the instinct for the show. How do I start a conversation about love?” 

	











	Whether Mister Romantic finds everlasting love or not is besides the point. With the character, Reilly succeeds with one simple, if increasingly difficult-sounding goal: “We're all going to be nice to each other for 90 minutes.”

	WASHINGTON — On Saturday, President Donald Trump held a hideously expensive military parade in Washington, D.C., on his birthday. Trump and his top officials stood on a stage at the National Mall behind two tanks, before two large digital American flags. Military bands and troops, some on horses, some in vehicles, some in tanks, others in Howitzers, marched in the streets. So did a few robot dogs. An army parachute team jumped down. Helicopters flew over. Drones flew by. There were many, many tanks.


	The spectacle was billed as honoring the U.S. Army's 250th birthday — and planners put in admirable effort to sell this fiction, with processions designed to honor key times in American military history. In reality, the event was just one part of the Trump administration's vast, billion-dollar government effort to make the leader feel good about himself. 


	The weekend's pageantry, which some administration officials referred to as “Donald Trump's birthday parade” behind closed doors, fulfilled the president's longtime desire for a grand military parade. Starting at the Pentagon in Virginia, the troops in the parade — who honored the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Global War on Terror — had to walk for about two-and-a-half miles.

	Trump sat next to his wife Melania and the former Fox News host, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. At points, Trump stood alone in front onstage, such as when he saluted troops marching as the 1st Cavalry Division. At another point, Secretary of State Marco Rubio was pictured yawning on C-SPAN. The military officials shown on C-SPAN spoke with reverence about the War on Terror. 

	











	Late in the event, Trump stood at a podium onstage and swore in 250 new or reenlisting troops. “Welcome to the United States Army and have a great life,” Trump said after they recited the Oath of Enlistment. “Thank you very much. Have a great life.” 


	After two hours, the event reached its logical conclusion: political speeches. J.D. Vance briefly went first. “June 14 is of course the birthday of the Army,” Vance said. “It is, of course, the birthday of the president of the United States. And Happy Birthday, Mr. President.” He delivered the laugh line of the night. “It's also my wedding anniversary,” he said before immediately leaving the stage.

	Finally, Trump spoke. He praised the army — and armies of years past. “Our soldiers never give up, never surrender and never ever quit. They fight, fight, fight and they win, win, win,” Trump said, in what seemed like an obvious reference to his own declaration of “Fight, Fight, Fight,” after a failed assassination attempt grazed his ear in Butler, Pennsylvania, during a campaign event last year.


	“We're the hottest country in the world right now,” Trump said. “Our country will soon be greater and stronger than ever before.” He said America is “blessed beyond words by this valued legion of army warriors.”


	He continued, “No matter the obstacles, our warriors will charge into battle. They will plunge into the crucible of fire, and they will seize the crown of victory, because the United States of America will always have the grace of Almighty God and the iron will of the United States Army. Congratulations to everybody. We love our country. We've never done better. Thank you. God bless you. God bless the army and God bless America.”


	Trump stood for a moment beside his wife, Melania, before Trump campaign regular Lee Greenwood sang “God Bless the U.S.A.” (Trump and Greenwood sell a bible together.) “Happy birthday Mr. President,” Greenwood said at one point.

	When he was done, attendees started singing happy birthday to Trump near the stage.


	Even before the speech component, the C-SPAN feed gave off a vibe that alternated between military recruitment video and softcore Trump propaganda. Video played several times of Trump giving speeches. Occasionally, a small banner popped up that said: “Video courtesy of America 250.” The nonprofit America 250, which is helping organize the ongoing publicly-funded campaign celebrating the country's semiquincentennial, has been taken over by Trump allies and one of his campaign operatives.

	











	Corporate America did its part. “Special thanks to our sponsor Lockheed Martin,” the MC said around 6:30 p.m., shouting out America's biggest defense contractor. The MC later thanked “our special sponsor Coinbase,” the cryptocurrency exchange. President Trump sure loves crypto — he reported in his financial disclosure Friday that he made $57 million in the final months of 2024 after he and his family launched their own crypto exchange, World Liberty Financial. (That was before he launched his own $TRUMP meme coin.) 


	Around 7 p.m., the big screens onstage that displayed the American flags turned to logos for UFC, the mixed martial arts business. Later, the MC thanked “special sponsor Palantir,” a contractor hired to help Trump compile data on Americans across federal agencies. 


	Military handed out drinks from sponsor Phorm Energy — a new beverage by Anheuser-Busch and UFC CEO Dana White, in the flavor Screamin' Freedom.


	Rock music was the soundtrack of the parade, including AC/DC's “Thunderstruck,” during the War on Terror section. There were instrumentals from the Heart song “Barracuda” and Metallica's “Enter Sandman.”


	The military parade was overseen by the American commander-in-chief as he conducts a militarized crackdown on immigrants in Los Angeles, California, driving protests. He sent in National Guard troops and Marines not because their presence is necessary to keep the peace, but as a show of force — and as a test run for operations in other states and cities, should the president feel angry enough to launch them, likely illegally.


	At 2,000 locations across the country, protesters held a “No Kings” Day to voice their anger toward the president. About 20,000 people gathered in downtown Los Angeles, undeterred by law enforcement's use of non-lethal weapons on earlier protests and the president's escalation by sending in troops. 


	Law enforcement largely left protesters alone for much of the day, but they deployed tear gas in the Atlanta area and arrested eight people, Fox 5 Atlanta reported. 


	For an event that shut down much of central Washington D.C., closed key roads, and reportedly cost up to $45 million, the promise of a display of America's military might — that just coincidentally happened to fall on Trump's birthday — didn't exactly draw out legions of his fans. Instead, the crowd of supporters, servicemembers, curious locals, and military-adjacent spectators who braved the oppressive heat and humidity of a post-thunderstorm D.C. managed to just fill out their allotted side of the street over several blocks in front of the White House, with plenty of room to spare. 

	











	In front of the central stage, a crowd befitting a midsize concert gathered in view of Jumbotrons. The lawns surrounding the Washington monument — which have hosted countless inaugurations, protests, concerts, and gatherings — were largely unused overflow space.


	When the TV broadcast showed the crowd risers along the parade route, they were sparsely filled. The National Park Service issued permits for 250,000 people for the National Mall festival and the military parade. An aerial parade of historic military aircraft flew above the National Mall, traversing a course from the Lincoln Memorial to the Washington Memorial that — despite clear anticipation of crowds by event organizers — was more empty field and food truck line than crowd.


	Though rock music blared on TV, the parade itself was eerily quiet. One video posted on X shows tanks squeaking past nearly silent crowds, sounding like a grocery cart in need of grease.


	In the weeks leading up to his birthday and the parade, Trump told close associates that protesters were going to try to overshadow the military parade, including in media coverage, in D.C. and elsewhere, and that he was determined not to let that happen, a source with knowledge of the matter and another person briefed on it tell Rolling Stone.

	The made-for-TV military parade looked expensive — but not necessarily impressive. Meanwhile, millions of people reportedly participated in “No Kings” parades Saturday across the country.


	As the D.C. military parade took place, hundreds of protesters stood outside the federal building in downtown Los Angeles. People had been dancing around, before hundreds of cops circled the four-block square without warning or announcement, leading to a tense stand-off, according to a Rolling Stone reporter on the ground. Flash bangs went off, and police used tear gas and smoke grenades to clear protesters.

Joseph Gutheinz, a retired senior special agent with NASA's Office of Inspector General and current criminal defense attorney, discussed the existence of UFOs with Fox News Digital.

In an era captivated by unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and government conspiracies, one former NASA official is cutting through the noise and casting doubt on aliens coming to Earth.

Joseph Gutheinz, a retired senior special agent with NASA's Office of Inspector General and current criminal defense attorney, said it's time to apply science, not speculation, to the debate.

""Prove it. Honestly, prove it,"" he said to those who believe in the presence of UFOs on Earth.

""They've been claiming that there have been UFOs since the 1940s. And, you know, Area 51 supposedly houses UFOs,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""Have someone go in, look at Area 51.""

Gutheinz said that during his work with the NASA Office of Inspector General, he would regularly get calls from individuals who believed they were abducted, or had a chip in their brain from aliens.

""What I used to tell my students was the possibility of anybody coming from another world to visit us was beyond unlikely,"" he said. ""And what I would tell the people that would call me up with these tales about being visited by aliens, see a psychiatrist.""

Citing astronomical distances and scientific understanding of the solar system, Gutheinz explained the improbability of any extraterrestrial visitors reaching Earth. 

""There are up to 400 billion stars in the Milky Way. There are maybe one to two trillion galaxies in the universe. But the reality is this, the closest solar system is Alpha Centauri. Alpha Centauri A, B, and Proxima Centauri are the closest stars,"" he said.

""The bottom line is that it's 4.4 light years away, or 25 trillion miles away. And if somebody started flying to Proxima and Satori, or the other way around, it would take them over 70,000 years to get there,"" he said. ""Nobody is visiting us from another world, likely.""

He pointed to moons like Europa, Ganymede, Titan, and Triton as the only plausible places for primitive life in our solar system. 

""If there is life on any of those moons, it's possible. Again, it is primitive, it is microorganisms, it's nothing that's going to visit us in a flying saucer.""

When asked whether such sightings could be explained as natural or spiritual phenomena, he suggested that it could be government testing.

""If you're seeing something up there, and it's real, it's coming from the Chinese or the Russians or your next-door neighbor flying around with their drone,"" he said.

Historical military secrecy, Gutheinz suggested, may have played a major role in fostering the UFO myths.

""I believe early on in the 1940s when all these UFO stories started coming up, it was because the military was probably testing some aircraft, and they didn't want the Russians to know about it,"" he said.

""And so, if the UFO cover worked, and I would not be surprised if there are some people in the military and the government that played along with that in order to conceal our stealth technology, that is really remarkable, and they just don't want to share that with other countries.""

""The bottom line is, I think that we use the UFO cover to hide a lot of things.""

""I believe early on in the 1940s when all these UFO stories started coming up, it was because the military was probably testing some aircraft, and they didn't want the Russians to know about it,"" he said.

""And so, if the UFO cover worked, and I would not be surprised if there are some people in the military and the government that played along with that in order to conceal our stealth technology, that is really remarkable, and they just don't want to share that with other countries.""

""The bottom line is, I think that we use the UFO cover to hide a lot of things.""

Author Jay Lang will be returning to her Valley roots when she visits the Comox library to read from her new novel Dancing Mary, which illuminates Comox folklore.

Based on chilling true events, Dancing Mary unearths the long-buried story of a young K'ómoks First Nation woman-named Mary by early settlers-who was betrayed and murdered by the very man she once trusted. Her spirit, said to appear as a shimmering blue orb, haunted the area for decades.

The last vivid encounter occurred in 1914, when a soldier cycling down Comox Road rode through the ghostly light and described an otherworldly cold that he would never forget. From that moment on, the legend of ""Dancing Mary"" was born-named for the spectral sway of her ghostly presence.

But Mary's tale is more than just a ghost story.

Interwoven with the haunting is the emotional journey of a grieving father and daughter who return to the Comox Valley to lay to rest the ashes of their beloved wife and mother, lost to suicide in Vancouver. As they confront their own pain, they are pulled into the valley's dark folklore, discovering a connection between past and present that is as healing as it is harrowing.

Blending historical tragedy, supernatural mystery, and human resilience, Dancing Mary is a gripping narrative of danger, loss, and the power of a spirit who refuses to be forgotten. Both a ghost story and a story of healing, it asks: what happens when the dead speak-and who among the living is ready to listen?

The Vancouver Island Regional Library is thrilled to host Lang at the Comox branch on Saturday, July 5 at 2-3 p.m. located at 1720 Beaufort Ave.

“Miracles happen here.”

That's the slogan of one megachurch in southwest Miami-Dade County at the forefront of the fast-growing Christian “supernatural” movement.

It's an Evangelical offshoot, rooted in Pentecostalism, that leans far more heavily into revelations and prophecy than mainstream Christian churches and wields out-sized powerful political influence.

That was evident recently at King Jesus Ministry, a nondenominational megachurch where President Donald Trump's top spiritual advisor, pastor Paula White-Cain, has been a visitor over the years. The church hosted a three-day spiritual conference called the “Supernatural School of the Spirit,” where White-Cain and other visiting pastors preached and instructed crowds of followers and local faith leaders on how to “walk in the supernatural.”

King Jesus is just one of the largest South Florida churches steeped in the movement. Another Miami megachurch with a prominent Haitian-American congregation, Tabernacle of Glory, has credited its large following with its emphasis on the supernatural. The nondenominational church opened its $60 million campus in northern Miami-Dade County last year.

At these churches, it's not uncommon to hear pastors talking about ‘dominion' theologies or ‘cosmic spiritual warfare.' Sometimes, they may speak in tongues or even perform a ‘deliverance' or what most people know as an exorcism, to cast out demonic forces.

Religious scholars say the branch springs from a movement called ‘Independent charismatic Christianity' that gained momentum in the 1960s. Its followers, estimated to be in the millions in America, hold supernatural beliefs and goals of transforming secular society. They've built increasing influence in American politics, supporting candidacies of conservative leaders like President Donald Trump.

“Independent Charismatic leaders, who 20 years ago would have been mocked by mainstream religious right leaders, are now front-line captains in the American culture wars,” writes religious scholar Matthew Taylor, in his book “The Violent Take it By Force.”

The Miami Herald spoke to Taylor to discuss some of the themes and ideologies that are found in these churches and how they intersect with American political circles.

This term is popular in charismatic Christian circles and might refer to a church where supernatural experiences — some not defined by logic or reason — take place.

But the charismatic Christian world also is a “diffuse” space, where many terms are interchangeable or sometimes defined differently from church to church, said Taylor.

“Sometimes charismatics will call themselves charismatic. Sometimes they'll say they're spirit-filled ... sometimes they'll just say they're Christians. Sometimes they'll call themselves Evangelicals,” said Taylor, a senior Christian scholar at the Institute for Islamic, Christian, and Jewish Studies in Baltimore who spent 30 years of his life as an Evangelical Christian.

“To be charismatic is to seek after the more supernatural dimensions of Christianity ... and this is why they're constantly emphasizing prophecy, constantly emphasizing speaking in tongues and healings and miracles,” said Taylor.

The term ‘supernatural' is not new, and has been circulating for decades within the charismatic Christian movement. There's an entire Christian media network, for example, led by charismatic leader Sid Roth called “It's Supernatural! that has been around for decades, said Taylor. Believers will appear on the network to tell stories about the miracles they've witnessed.

One belief that unifies this Christian subculture is the idea that God speaks through prophecy. Many of the leaders in this movement — like Pastor Guillermo Maldonado of King Jesus and White-Cain — are considered by the faithful to be modern-day Apostles or Prophets who can perform ‘healings' or deliver prophecies during sermons.

Since the movement often operates without a formal connection to more established denominations, leaders may have varying degrees of theological education but will lean on or cite mentors in the movement. The leaders often have ten or hundreds of thousands of followers, or a background in televangelism, and their success can sometimes depend on who they know in the charismatic world — similar, Taylor writes, to how Hollywood operates.

Taylor, who has interviewed many charismatic Christian leaders, describes them as “idiosyncratic” and “incredibly compelling” people. “They're very socially skilled,” he said. “They're very good at reaching and teaching and providing people with these compelling experiences.”

Many apostolic leaders believe the Christian church has languished for centuries, and that God has brought them in to reinvigorate the church through Holy Spirit-backed leadership.

Common themes focus on “End-times,” or the second coming of Jesus, and a the idea of ‘dominion,' or Christians needing to conquer various aspects of society.

There's also an emphasis, similar to Pentecostal churches, on promoting inner healing through living a more Christian lifestyle. The promise of a better, healthier life can appeal to those who are struggling with addiction problems, health — physical or mental — problems or financial hardship. Prosperity — achieving financial wealth — also is a key theme, one that goes hand-in-hand with financial giving to the church. This idea is common in many churches that ask members to ‘tithe,' but this movement stresses that more giving can mean more rewards.

Many followers find a sense of empowerment, contentment and community in the movement, Taylor says.

“There have been studies even on how Pentecostal and charismatic ministries around the world have done a great deal of lifting people out of a lower-class existence economically by empowering them and telling them ‘Hey, you have agency.'”

At the same time, Taylor points out, those experiences are “being utilized in this broader political project,” to get more Christians on board with conservative political agendas.

Another theory of why it's so popular: In a modern, industrialized world where knowledge is at the fingertips of everyone with a Smartphone, charismatic leaders could be ‘re-enchanting' the world for people who want more of a sense of mystery and wonder, said Taylor, referring to the concept of ‘disenchantment' made popular by philosopher, Charles Taylor.

“People want a sense of a sublime and powerful force in the universe that's guiding and moving them around,” he said.

According to Taylor, independent charismatics are the fastest-growing religious demographic in the United States and around world. The followers are well into the millions, or hundreds of millions worldwide by some estimates, but the actual number is hard to measure, since the group is not tied to a formal denomination.

“For people who are searching for an anchor in the world or searching for self-confidence or searching for a sense of what their purpose is in life, ... they're scratching where people itch,” Taylor said.

It's similar, but without the bylaws and bureaucratic oversight that comes with a denomination, or network of churches with an established hierarchy.

“They believe that ‘We need the Holy Spirit to be unrestrained. We need the fires of revival prayer,' said Taylor. “But that same lack of restraint makes it very susceptible to political co-optation, because .. there's not a lot of oversight.”

Pentecostalism, a movement within Protestant Christianity, is a denomination that can be traced back as early as 1900's and emphasizes manifestations of the Holy Spirit — such as supernatural healing and speaking in tongues. In the early years of Pentecostalism, its followers were largely poor Angelo and African Americans, according to Pew Research, and women have always had a large role.

In the late-1940s, various ‘healing evangelists' began traveling around the country, filling tents and auditoriums that attracted tens of thousands of people, according to Taylor's book. Some of the preachers, like Oral Roberts, were Pentecostal preachers who found their way on television to bring the movement out of tents and into the mainstream world.

In the 1950s, Roberts teamed up with preacher Kenneth Hagin and began teaching about an ideology called the “Word of Faith” doctrine, which emphasized a form of faith that rewards devout Christians with healings and blessings. The ideas found in the doctrine gave rise to what is known today as the ‘prosperity gospel.'

Some religious scholars, many who are Christians themselves, point out that the movement is also putting spiritual influence to other uses. Leaders aim to exert more influence over everything from popular culture and education to politics. It's that latter field where the supernatural movement and other Evangelicals have arguably had the most success.

Last week at King Jesus Ministry, for instance, White-Cain outlined a vision of a society transformed by Christian ideology, urging believers to play a role in making it a reality.

“You didn't come to fit in, You came to take over. You came to move in your Kingdom calling. That threatens people who don't understand the word of God because their language, their understanding is not like yours. God birthed you to rule, to have dominion,” she said.

White-Cain has been one of the most influential voices in charismatic Christianity, and is someone who was able to bring its ideology into the mainstream and now, as the head of the newly established White House Faith Office, into American politics.

“Very soon our Lord and savior Jesus Christ is going to split the sky and come back,” she said during her sermon. “This is not your home, this is your assignment. And you and I have to reap the harvest.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","'Supernatural' Might Be Known for Its Dark Storylines, but This Episode Completely Changed the Tone of the Show","https://collider.com/supernatural-changing-channels-funny/","Sun, 15 Jun 2025 16:10:00 GMT","

It's no secret that Supernatural was always at its best when it committed to being a horror series. Hunting down ghosts, monsters, demons, and otherworldly creatures was where the Winchesters thrived, and each new case opened the door to some personal and intimate drama. But there is one Supernatural episode that sticks out as being a masterclass in comedic timing, blending the show's intense mytharc with one of the most ingenious characters the series put together. Give up? I'm talking about Season 5's ""Changing Channels,"" which makes me laugh and holler every time I turn it on.

When ""Changing Channels"" starts, we're already thrown head-first into the wild antics that are about to ensure. With an intro that feels like Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) have been transported to a bad '90s sitcom, we're then delighted with a theme song (dubbed ""Together We'll Face the Day"") that shows us just what we're in store for. Frankly, there are few comedic episodes of the show that are structured as well as ""Changing Channels,"" and it's easy to see why it remains such a fan favorite to this day. It's certainly one of my favorite episodes, even if I generally prefer the show's standard horror dramas. What other show can throw its leading characters into ""TV Land"" (or ""TV Hell,"" if you rather), flipping through different genres and shows as if some otherworldly viewer were changing channels on them? Penned by future showrunner Jeremy Carver, ""Changing Channels"" is quite inspired.

This episode takes the Winchesters through soapy medical dramas, Japanese game shows, a Knight Rider parody, and more. The only thing really missing is a Western, but the show would get to that the following season. As the Winchesters are sucked into a reality where they must pretend to survive, the theme of the episode becomes ""play your roles,"" which has a double meaning by the end. There's so much to unpack here, with plenty of hilarious ""in"" moments and references for longtime fans, not to mention all the great material for Ackles and Padalecki to work with. Of course, it's also a Trickster (Richard Speight Jr.) episode, so just like ""Tall Tales"" or ""Mystery Spot,"" we can expect this one to get a bit crazy, and it delivers in the best of ways.

In a season that was so often focused on the looming Apocalypse, ""Changing Channels"" uniquely addresses Sam and Dean's destiny while still living up to the show's clever and hilarious antics. The beauty of it is that the episode can really be enjoyed as-is, whether you are invested in the overall plotline or not. It's endlessly rewatchable. I've certainly shown this single episode to folks who had only vague ideas of what Supernatural is about, and the response is always the same. There's something about the way that Padalecki and Ackles play Sam and Dean that always feels universal and accessible, no matter the context of previous episodes. ""Changing Channels"" certainly fits that bill.

Ever since Season 2's ""Tall Tales"" and ""Hollywood Babylon,"" Supernatural steered further and further into the meta space, and Season 5 is where a lot of that comes to a head. ""The Real Ghostbusters"" is all about Sam and Dean's five-season story, including fans in the narrative. But ""Changing Channels"" (which aired only a week prior) explored these meta ideas another way. On the Japanese game show ""Nutcracker!,"" for instance, the episode asks Sam and Dean questions about their life and childhood. But, because the host is speaking in Japanese, it's only the audience (who has the benefit of subtitles) that is privy to what is being discussed. (I love the whole bit about Sam being asked about his connections to Ruby, it's a great in-joke that works perfectly for devoted fans.) Additionally, the show riffs on other shows and genres as well, spoofing Grey's Anatomy, NCIS, and other procedurals that so often feel like the same thing over and over again.

As the show continued, episodes like ""The French Mistake"" and ""Fan Fiction"" would continue this trend, but only ""Changing Channels"" was able to blend meta humor about Supernatural itself with television as a whole. What I think is especially great is that it doesn't just stick to the types of shows or content currently on air. The sitcom sequence feels a bit dated compared to many of the sitcoms that were popular at the time (The Office comes to mind), and the Knight Rider bit at the end is undoubtedly a callback to '80s television. That's not even getitng into the commercial sequence for ""Herpexia,"" where Sam is forced to talk about his experience with genital herpes.

It's a surprisingly heartfelt declaration of love and gives a behind-the-scenes look at 'Supernatural.'

In addition to naming the aforementioned ""The French Mistake"" as one of his favorite episodes, series creator Eric Kripke told Entertainment Weekly in 2016 that ""Changing Channels"" was his other most-watched episode. It's not hard to understand why. While ""The French Mistake"" is a love-letter to Supernatural as a television production, ""Changing Channels"" is a Winchester power hour that perfectly unites the show's occasionally campy tone with the intensity of the Apocalypse story at the heart of Sam and Dean's life. Sure, there are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments here worth enjoying, but the way the brothers' journey through this TV Hell leads to a full-on confrontation with the Trickster (revealed to be the archangel Gabriel) about the importance of loyalty and family, makes the end of the episode just as strong dramatically as the rest of it is comedically.

Although he didn't write the episode, I fully understand why Kripke is drawn to both ""Changing Channels"" and ""The French Mistake."" They may depart from the tone of the show's earliest years, but they do so in a way that honors the show's own metamorphosis over the span of five and six seasons. Which one is better? It's hard to say, and I think that's why Kripke cites both as his favorite episodes rather than choosing between them. But if you're looking to revisit a great Supernatural episode with hysterical stakes and a deep, impactful ending, then ""Changing Channels"" ought to be the one you choose. There are few episodes of any ""spooky procedural"" out there as hilarious as this one.

Supernatural is available for streaming on Netflix.

Celebrity psychic John Edward is in Australia for a series of his famous live medium events in the coming weeks. 

But the American mystic left the stars of The Project less than impressed when he refused to do a reading live on air on Sunday night. 

The 55-year-old was asked by host Sam Taunton, 'are you feeling anything from anyone at the desk right now?' 

'Not at the moment, not at the moment' Edwards admitted, to which co-host Waleed Aly replied, 'Well I could have done that!' 

The mockery sparked laughter from the show's panel of hosts, leaving a red-faced Edward to explain why he won't do readings live on television.

'I tell you why. If I read for a host of a show and I get something private, this is not taped, it's live, and it's not something that someone wants to discuss publicly, you're going to say no' he said. 

'I've had a bad experience. On radio, many, many years ago. I was reading for a Christian conservative host of a radio show. 

'He said, ""I have legacy in the marketplace, my audience knows everything about me"". I said, ""okay."" 

'He was being very difficult. In the commercial break, I said, does your audience know you decided not to to have a fifth child and terminate the pregnancy? 

'He was like, ""no"". I asked him, ""If I would have said that on the air, what would you have said? [he replied] ""I would have had to lie because my mother-in-law listens to the show.""' 

John recently has issued a strong message to his non-believers. 

Speaking to The Daily Telegraph, the medium said he has no qualms about people questioning his abilities - as they have done for decades - but only if they are willing to open their mind. 

'I think we're living at a time on the planet where people's critical thinking skills need to be really sharpened and addressed because of whatever the latest AI thing that's happening or just social media – so I think it's really important for people to go, ""hey, wait, I'm not sure, let me see what kind of validation is there""' he said.

'I've had a bad experience. On radio, many, many years ago. I was reading for a Christian conservative host of a radio show' he explained 

'So I welcome it [scepticism] – it's important – as long as we can have a conversation about it.

'But when somebody pushes a little bit too much more, then I have to push back, and I have to be like 'woah – you can't define me, you don't know me'. 

The New York native also said that he can't wait to return to Australia, as he has always loved the country's 'energy'.

He praised the nation's strong sense of community and said Australians always make him feel welcome when he visits.

Edward rose to fame in 2001 with his controversial Crossing Over program, in which he claimed to speak to the deceased relatives of audience members. 

His supposed psychic abilities have been dismissed by many, with critics claiming the reality star is merely practicing a form of cold reading.

He has been married to Sandra McGee since 1995 and the couple share two children: son Justin and daughter Olivia.

Back in 2017, Edward told news.com.au that he never set out to be a celebrity and that it simply happened as a result of his psychic abilities.

'I never woke up and decided, 'I'm going to be a world famous medium',' John said.

'And I never wanted to be on TV, it was an opportunity that came as a byproduct of my work.'

To navigate the skies, birds rely on a complex sensory tool kit.

Every year, billions of birds migrate in and out of the United States. And across the world, birds fly thousands of miles to reach their seasonal destinations. Some birds, like the Arctic tern (Sterna paradisaea), even rack up enough miles over their lifetime to fly to the moon and back.

But when birds embark on these epic journeys, how do they know where they're going?

Birds have an arsenal of senses they use to orient themselves — some we're familiar with, and some are still beyond human comprehension.

""We know that birds use a variety of cues to keep their migratory direction,"" Miriam Liedvogel, director of the Institute of Avian Research in Germany, told Live Science in an email.

Sight and smell are two basic cues that birds use to find their way. If birds have already migrated once, they'll likely remember familiar landmarks, such as rivers and mountain ranges. Birds that migrate over water, on the other hand, have fewer landmarks to guide them. In these circumstances, they might rely more on their sense of smell; one study found that when researchers blocked the nasal passageways of seabirds called Scopoli's shearwaters (Calonectris diomedea), they could still fly over land but became disoriented when flying over water.

Birds also can use the sun and stars as guides. To do this, birds that fly during the day use a ""sun compass,"" which combines birds' view of where the sun is in the sky with their internal perception of what time of day it is based on their circadian rhythm. By integrating these two inputs, birds can determine the direction they're heading, like a living sundial. Research shows that disrupting a bird's circadian rhythm with artificial light prevents them from navigating accurately, showing the importance of the sun compass.

However, most birds actually migrate at night, meaning the position of the sun is of little use to them. In this case, birds rely on the position and rotation of the stars to find their way. They use this star compass by learning the position of the stars around the celestial pole, which is roughly marked by Polaris (the North Star) — the same star humans have used to navigate for millennia.

But what if the sky is cloudy, and birds can't see the sun, stars or any landmarks? That's when birds' more fantastic senses come into play. Birds can find their way even with no sun or stars, partly thanks to a sense called magnetoreception. This sense allows birds to perceive Earth's magnetic fields, which are generated by the rippling molten metals in our planet's core. This feat may sound like science fiction, but research shows that messing with magnetic fields has a big effect on birds; for example, one study found that altering the magnetic fields around pigeons disrupted their homing abilities.

While it's clear that birds are capable of magnetoreception, exactly how they do it is less certain. Peter Hore, a professor of chemistry at the University of Oxford, said birds must utilize some sort of chemical reaction whose outcome depends on the strength and direction of Earth's magnetic field. There are a couple of candidate theories for how this reaction happens, but Hore's bet is on a molecule called cryptochrome, which is present in birds' retinas.

Researchers have confirmed in the lab that isolated cryptochrome responds to magnetic fields and that this reaction requires blue light, which has also been shown to be necessary for bird magnetoreception. Still, researchers aren't exactly sure how cryptochrome is sensitive enough to pick up on tiny variations in Earth's magnetic field.

""We know so little about the details of how this compass might operate,"" Hore said. ""I mean, we don't even know how many cryptochrome molecules there are in the birds' retinas.""

Some research also points to a magnetoreception mechanism inside birds' beaks. Studies have found receptors that interact with magnetite, an iron-based mineral, in the upper portion of birds' beaks. These receptors connect to the brain via important nerve pathways, suggesting they could be another technique birds use to gauge the intensity of the magnetic field.

On top of magnetoreception, birds can gain information about their direction by detecting polarized light — a type of light in which the waves oscillate in a specific, aligned plane. Sunlight becomes polarized in predictable ways when light scatters through Earth's atmosphere. Using special cells in their retinas, birds can sense these patterns, which give them information about where the sun is in the sky, even when it's overcast.

Just as we rely on our vision during the day but may use our hands to guide ourselves around a dimly lit room at night, birds employ different senses at different times.

""Birds likely integrate their compass cues to navigate — and we are pretty sure that different cues are of varying importance during their journey,"" Liedvogel said. Hore pointed this out as well; magnetoreception, for example, is less useful during thunderstorms or periods of high solar activity, both of which can disrupt Earth's magnetic fields, he said.

—Are birds reptiles?

—Why do hummingbirds 'hum'?

—Why are there so many pigeons?

Ultimately, all of these strategies are underpinned by birds' genetic drive to migrate. Birds inherit the propensity to migrate from their parents, Liedvogel explained, and the distance and direction in which they fly are primarily based on genetics. Researchers like Liedvogel are still investigating exactly which genes are responsible and how they work.

Both scientists said understanding these systems will be essential to the future of bird conservation. Relocating or rewilding bird species has become a major focus of wildlife conservation efforts, but so far, outcomes have been mixed; one analysis found that in 45% of studies, the birds left their new location.

""Human efforts to relocate those birds have not been very successful,"" Hore said. ""That's partly because they are such good navigators that if you displace them, they simply fly back.""

New James Webb Space Telescope data reveal Pluto's high-altitude haze is a key driver of the climate on the dwarf planet, offering clues to Earth's ancient atmosphere.

Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have taken a fresh look at the distant edges of our solar system — and found that, once again, Pluto is defying expectations.

When NASA's New Horizons spacecraft flew past Pluto in 2015, it shattered the notion that the dwarf planet was a dormant ball of ice, instead revealing it to be rich with icy plains and jagged mountains. But one of the biggest surprises floated above it all: a bluish, multi-layered haze blanketing the world's sky, stretching more than 185 miles (300 kilometers) above the surface — far higher and more intricate than scientists had predicted.

Now, nearly a decade later, new data from JWST confirm that Pluto's haze isn't just a visual oddity, it also controls the dwarf planet's climate.

""This is unique in the solar system,"" Tanguy Bertrand, an astronomer at the Paris Observatory in France who led the analysis, told Live Science. ""It's a new kind of climate, let's say.""

The findings, described in a study published June 2 in the journal Nature Astronomy, suggest similar dynamics may be at play on other haze-shrouded worlds in our solar system, and even offer clues about our own planet's early climate.

Pluto's high-altitude haze is made of complex organic molecules from sunlight-driven reactions of methane and nitrogen. The idea that this haze could control Pluto's climate was first proposed in 2017. Computer models suggested these particles absorb sunlight during the day and release it back into space as infrared energy at night, cooling the atmosphere much more efficiently than gases alone. This could also explain why Pluto's upper atmosphere is roughly -333 degrees Fahrenheit (-203 degrees Celsius) — 30 degrees cooler than expected.

For years, however, testing that theory proved difficult. One major challenge was Pluto's large moon, Charon, which orbits the frigid planet so closely that their thermal signals often overlap in telescope data. ""Basically, we couldn't know what part of the signal is due to Charon and what part is due to Pluto's haze,"" Bertrand said.

The researchers behind the 2017 study predicted that Pluto's haze would make the world unusually bright in mid-infrared wavelengths — a prediction that, at the time, could only be tested with future instruments. That opportunity arrived in 2022, when JWST's powerful infrared instruments were finally able to separate the two worlds' signals. Sure enough, the faint infrared glow of Pluto's haze matched the predictions.

""In planetary science, it's not common to have a hypothesis confirmed so quickly, within just a few years,"" Xi Zhang, a planetary scientist at the University of California, Santa Cruz who led the 2017 team, said in a statement. ""So we feel pretty lucky and very excited.""

These findings also open up the possibility that similar haze-driven climates might exist on other hazy worlds, such as Neptune's moon Triton or Saturn's moon Titan, Bertrand said.

Even Earth's distant past might bear a resemblance, the researchers said. Before oxygen transformed our planet's skies, it's possible that Earth was veiled in a haze of organic particles — a blanket that may have helped stabilize temperatures and foster early life.

""By studying Pluto's haze and chemistry, we might get new insights into the conditions that made early Earth habitable,"" Zhang said in the statement.

Lionel Messi drew vast crowds and showed flashes of his brilliance when his Inter Miami side were held to a goalless draw by African giants Al-Ahly as the revamped FIFA Club World Cup got off to a festive start on Saturday.

Fans showed up en masse for the Group A clash at the Hard Rock Stadium, home to the NFL's Miami Dolphins, but Messi could not fully deliver, his best chance coming through a last-second attempt that was deflected onto the crossbar.

Inter Miami next face FC Porto on Thursday in Atlanta, while Al-Ahly, who benefited from raucous, massive support, are to take on Palmeiras in New York, where more of their fans are expected to turn up.

No incidents were reported at the game after about 1,000 protesters gathered in the morning near US President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate, about 110km north of Miami, waving placards and chanting slogans as part of coordinated nationwide “No Kings” demonstrations.

In Miami, 60,927 fans almost filled the 65,000-capacity stadium for Inter Miami's clash with Al-Ahly, dismissing, at least on the night, concerns about the attractiveness of the tournament featuring 32 teams for the first time, a year before the FIFA World Cup in the US.

Inter Miami, whose home attendances average 20,663 in their 21,550-seat Chase Stadium, have been a major road draw this year, regularly attracting record crowds across the country since Messi's arrival in 2023.

Adan De La Rosa travelled from Mexico just to see Messi play. “There's a lot of excitement to see Messi, it's the same for everyone,” he said.

Al-Ahly, backed by dozens of thousands of fans, got off to a strong start, but wasted two early chances, and Oscar Ustari parried away Trezeguet's poorly taken penalty kick after Zizo was fouled in the box by Telasco Segovia.

Messi threatened at times after spending some time on the ground after being hit on the knee, but Miami could feel lucky not to be behind at halftime.

However, Miami stepped up a gear after the break, and Messi came close when his nicely curled 25m free-kick kissed the post and hit the side netting.

With six minutes left, the World Cup winner scooped a perfect cross for Fafa Picault, whose header was tipped over the bar by Mohamed Elshenawy.

He came an inch close in the dying second when his curled strike from outside the box was tipped onto the bar by Elshenawy.

The Club World Cup continued after press time last night with UEFA Champions League winners Paris St Germain taking on Atletico Madrid and Bayern Munich playing Auckland City.



                                                                                Brazil has four teams, more than any other country, in the expanded Club World Cup that kicked off yesterday in the US, but for SE Palmeiras, the competition holds a special meaning: winning it would provide some redemption.
Under coach Abel Ferreira since 2020, Palmeiras lifted two Copa Libertadores titles, plus Brazilian league, cup and state championships. Even before Ferreira, it boasted another South American crown and 11 league titles.
The only major trophy missing is a world champions' title.
Other Brazilian clubs like Fluminense FC and Botafogo FR, also in the tournament, have never won it either, but the problem for Palmeiras                                    



                                                                                Manchester City on Monday completed the signing of left-back Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolverhampton Wanderers for a reported ￡31 million (US$41.8 million). 
The 24-year-old Algeria international has signed a five-year contract and will be available for the FIFA Club World Cup, which begins later this week. 
Ait-Nouri is expected to be just one of a trio of new City faces for that tournament with deals close to completion for AC Milan midfielder Tijjani Reijnders and Olympique Lyonnais playmaker Rayan Cherki. 
After missing out on a major trophy in the recently completed season for the first time since 2016-2017, City are hoping                                    



                                                                                Hulking Italian sprinter Jonathan Milan on Monday surged away from the pack to win the second stage of the Criterium de Dauphine in Issoire, France, to take the overall lead from Tadej Pogacar. 
The 1.93m, 87kg Milan had to battle to keep up on a hilly 204.6km run through central France from Premilhat. When the pack hit the home straight, he rocketed away from his rivals to collect a 10-second victory bonus and the yellow jersey. 
“That was really tough,” Milan said. “I was dropped at one point, and I was really on the limit, but I have to say
