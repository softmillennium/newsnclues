                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Djokovic lost to Carlos Alcaraz in a five-set thriller on Centre Court, with the Spaniard clinching his first crown at the All England Club. It didn't take long for Djokovic to shut down those questions, however, as he went on to win his fourth US Open title later that season. After securing the trophy with a straight-sets win over Daniil Medvedev, he took a moment to answer his critics. When asked about public opinion of his potential decline in level after losing the Wimbledon final earlier that year, Djokovic said: “Well, I mean, people like to talk, obviously. “I mean, it's not my interest and neither business to really review what everyone talks about or thinks, whether there is a passing of the torch or new gen, next gen, future gen, whatever you want to call it, happening or not happening in the sport. “It's great for our sport that I have very good rivalries with Alcaraz, no doubt. He's such a refreshment for tennis, a great player, an amazing player, great guy as well. “So I think, you know, collectively we all want more attention and interest going towards the tennis. The more people get involved with tennis in whatever shape or form, the better it is for all of us. But, look, in the end of the day, you know, I have so much more to be happier and content with than actually to regret something. You know, I feel good in my own body. “I don't play as much in terms of other tournaments, so I try to, you know, prioritise my preparation so that I can peak in slams. “Yeah, these are the moments and these are the kind of emotions that I motivate myself with every single day when I'm not playing a tournament. “Yeah, occasionally asking myself, why do I need this still at this stage after all I have done, you know? How long do I want to keep going? I do have these questions in my head, of course. The 38-year-old has since played in six majors and has made one final and three semi-finals, but is yet to capture Grand Slam number 25.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As if saving three match points to win the French Open were not outlandish enough, Carlos Alcaraz has once again achieved the impossible: a quiet holiday in Ibiza. For two years in a row the Spaniard's team tried to dissuade him, twice he defied them and joined friends for three days to ‘reventar' - literally to burst, translated in Netflix's ghastly Hollywood dubbing as ‘get wasted'. After beating Jannik Sinner in one of the great Grand Slam finals last Sunday, Alcaraz partied in Paris until the early hours of Monday, then flew to Ibiza via Madrid. ‘This year Ibiza was more chill,' said Alcaraz at Queen's Club, on the eve of the event he won in 2023. ‘It was fun but honestly, I rested a lot, physically and mentally. But I had fun, a nice three days. ‘Once I went to bed so late, that's the craziest thing. More chill and as a normal person does.' Did his coach Juan Carlos Ferrero and agent Albert Molina try to persuade him not to go this time? They didn't,' said Alcaraz with his toothy grin. ‘They knew at the beginning of Roland Garros I was going to go, 100 per cent.' It has become a lethal formula: French Open, Ibiza, Queen's, win Wimbledon. If he makes it a hat trick of All England Club titles, as he is favourite to do, surely the routine will continue ad infinitum. ‘After Roland Garros is the best moment to go anywhere. My friends go to Ibiza every year but it doesn't matter where you go - it's a time to turn off your mind. ‘After such an intense Roland Garros it was great to disconnect from everything, have fun and then come back with more energy.' Alcaraz's trip to Ibiza last year left him undercooked for Queen's, and the man who took advantage was Jack Draper, beating the Spaniard in straight sets. The 23-year-old was upset by world No62 Alexander Bublik in the last 16 of the French Open, and had a couple of days off before getting back to work - although he was not tempted to join Alcaraz in heading off to a party island. It's nice to come back and take my mind off everything. ‘I don't feel the urge to be going out partying and all that stuff. One evening after training, Draper settled down in his Putney flat to watch the French Open final. ‘Unbelievable tennis,' said Draper, who plays tricky American Jenson Brooksby in the first round here. ‘It inspired all the players, it captured attention around the world, even people who aren't into tennis. As much as Alcaraz switched off from tennis in Ibiza, he could not resist watching a few highlights himself. ‘The bad thing in tennis is sometimes you don't have time to realise what you have done,' said Alcaraz, who will face fellow Spaniard Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in the first round of Queen's.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tatjana Maria knocked off four Top 20 players in a row to capture her first WTA 500 title at the HSBC Championships. She becomes the oldest titlist on tour since Serena Williams in 2020. Thanks to four Top 20 wins in a row, Tatjana Maria has been rewarded with her biggest career title -- as a 37-year-old mother of two. Capping off her incredible week of upsets, German qualifier Maria captured the WTA 500 HSBC Championships title on Sunday with a 6-3, 6-4 final victory over No. "It means a lot to me, because I'm 37 years old and I won this trophy today," Maria told the press. "People were always saying, 'Oh, now maybe it's time. "I'm a good example that even in my age you still can win big trophies. So it's not like only me that I won this trophy today. It's like my whole family won this trophy." Happy return: It is fitting that a veteran player won the title here, given that this was the first time since 1973 that WTA tennis has been contested at the prestigious Queen's Club in London. With the win, Maria maintained her undefeated record in WTA singles finals, improving to 4-0 when a title is on the line. The German won her first WTA title on grass at Mallorca in 2018, and then she became a Bogota expert, winning that clay-court event back-to-back in 2022 and 2023. Sunday, though, marked Maria's first career final above WTA 250-level. The step up in level did not faze her, and after beating Top 20 players Karolina Muchova, Elena Rybakina and Madison Keys consecutively to make the championship match, Maria completed her quartet of high-caliber wins with one final triumph. The only other time Maria had defeated multiple Top 20 players at a single event was during one of her other spectacular grass-court runs -- she ousted Maria Sakkari and Jelena Ostapenko en route to the 2022 Wimbledon semifinals. And, in fact, those were her most recent Top 20 wins until this week. "This week, actually, I really found my confidence. 15, Anisimova also had a wonderful week, besting Top 10 players Emma Navarro and Zheng Qinwen back-to-back in the last two rounds. But Maria's combo of slices, speed and big serves had proved too strong on the grass this week for every player she faced, and Anisimova was no exception. At one point, Maria won 12 points in a row during her run to a 4-1 lead in Sunday's first set. Even with her unorthodox shots, Maria hit only three unforced errors in the first set. In the second set, Maria raced out to a 4-1 lead again. 4 seeds Asia Muhammad and Demi Schuurs squeaked past No. 2 seeds Anna Danilina and Diana Shnaider 7-5, 6-7(3), [10-4] to take the title. Muhammad and Schuurs were unable to convert two championship points in the second set, but the American-Dutch duo took command in the decisive match-tiebreak to claim victory after 1 hour and 44 minutes. It's another big title this year for Muhammad and Schuurs, who won WTA 1000 Indian Wells in March. This is Muhammad's 13th career WTA doubles title, and Schuurs' 21st. Tatjana Maria knocked off four Top 20 players in a row to capture her first WTA 500 title at the HSBC Championships. She becomes the oldest titlist on tour since Serena Williams in 2020.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner admitted he has had "sleepless nights" since losing the French Open final to Carlos Alcaraz in five thrilling sets last week. While speaking to reporters in German at his pre-tournament press conference ahead of the Terra Wortman Open, Sinner spoke about both the positives and negatives of dealing with the agonizing loss. "I think that for me to play another tournament is positive, because every match is a new beginning, and I must be mentally ready to give my all on the court," Sinner said according to the ATP Tour's website. "Therefore, it is great I can be here in Halle. That is the most important thing for me. But the Spaniard, who had never completed a comeback from two sets down in his career before his thrilling victory in the Roland Garros final, fought back and saved three consecutive championship points en route to winning the match in improbable fashion. Not only did Sinner thrice lose out on an opportunity to secure the Musketeers' Cup, but he also won one more point than Alcaraz in the entire match, showcasing both how close he came and, yet, how gut-wrenching the defeat was. "I still think about those couple of points" 💔@janniksin on *that* Roland-Garros final vs Alcaraz#TWO25 pic.twitter.com/u3ZOFfBE1C It's worth noting that Sinner reached this level of play in just his second tournament since returning from a three-month doping suspension. He'll now turn his attention to the grass courts in Halle and then the iconic All-England Club for Wimbledon in just two weeks' time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>‘S-HERTOGENBOSCH - Gabriel Diallo has won his first ATP Tour title. Gabriel Diallo, of Canada, plays a shot to Fabian Marozsan, of Hungary, during their Davis Cup qualifying tennis match in Montreal on Sunday, Feb. 2, 2025. ‘S-HERTOGENBOSCH - Gabriel Diallo has won his first ATP Tour title. The 23-year-old Montreal native defeated Belgium's Zizou Bergs 7-5, 7-6 (8) to win the Libema Open tennis tournament on Sunday. In what was a tight, back-and-forth second set, Diallo was down 6-4 in the tiebreaker before pulling victory from the jaws of defeat. He got three straight points from then on before eventually taking the win. “Oh man, I don't have the words. It's something that you dream of for your whole life since you were a little kid, to get an ATP Tour title,” Diallo said in his on-court interview. “The fact that I was able to do it here after losing a final last year, it just means the world to me. He is also just the fourth Canadian to win an ATP Tour singles title this century after Milos Raonic (eight titles), Felix Auger-Aliassime (seven titles) and Denis Shapovalov (three titles). Diallo will rise 11 spots to a career-high No. He already guaranteed his top-50 debut by reaching the semifinals. This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 15, 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Just a week after the dramatic Roland Garros final, Jannik Sinner appears to have moved on from the disappointment in Paris and is already looking ahead to new goals—chiefly, Wimbledon. The Italian, hailing from San Candido, is embracing a philosophical outlook to process the heartbreaking loss at Roland Garros, where he held a two-set lead and had three match points before ultimately falling to Carlos Alcaraz. "Roland Garros didn't end the way I would've liked, but there are reasons to be satisfied," he said. You can dwell on the three match points I missed, or you can see it as the best clay-court match I've ever played. Carlos Alcaraz is a very strong player after all," explained the world No. "I played five hours without any physical issues," Sinner emphasized. Since the final, he's taken time off to recover and recharge before resuming competition in Halle. Throughout the past week, he made a conscious effort to unplug. "I spent a few days with friends and family. I enjoyed myself and had fun doing simple things. I'm fortunate to be surrounded by people who love and care about me," he added. Sinner will begin his title defense in Halle this coming Tuesday, although he will get his first taste of grass on Sunday, partnering with Lorenzo Sonego in doubles. 1 will open against a qualifier and could potentially face past champions later in the draw. Looking further ahead to the semifinals, Sinner could be challenged by top-tier competitors such as Russians Andrey Rublev and Karen Khachanov, or Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime. He begins his campaign against American Marcos Giron and could later face former Halle champion Ugo Humbert, who opens against Canada's Denis Shapovalov. Also competing in Zverev's section are Italy's Lorenzo Sonego, Germany's Jan-Lennard Struff, breakout Brazilian star Joao Fonseca, and top names like Russia's Daniil Medvedev and Greece's Stefanos Tsitsipas—who is starting a new chapter under coach Goran Ivanisevic.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American alpine ski racer Lindsey Vonn shared a sarcastic reaction to current ATP No. Sinner will be teaming up with his compatriot, Lorenzo Sonego, to face the pair of Alex Michelsen and Karen Khachanov in the Round of 16 stage. Lindsey Vonn reacted to this part of the interview on Instagram and dropped a few laughing emojis in the comments section. Lindsey Vonn has been an admirer of Jannik Sinner for the last few years. Jannik Sinner made his feelings known on his emotions after defeat to Carlos Alcaraz in the finals of the 2025 Roland Garros. Notably, this was Sinner's second straight tournament finals loss to Alcaraz after the Italian Open in May. Sinner shared that he faced several sleepless nights after this defeat, and moving to a new tournament (Halle Open 2025) has been a positive for him. During the conversation, Sinner also mentioned the upcoming grass court season, stating that he uplifted his performance last year and is looking what this year has in store for him.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Madison Keys believes that Coco Gauff will not “care” about the ongoing fallout from comments made by Aryna Sabalenka after the French Open final. World No 2 Gauff battled from a set down to beat world No 1 Sabalenka 6-7(5), 6-2, 6-4 in an enthralling match at Roland Garros, lifting her second Grand Slam singles title. But, in her press conference, Sabalenka then claimed that her unforced errors had been key to the final, and that Iga Swiatek, whom she beat in the semi-final, would have beaten Gauff. Sabalenka later clarified her comments and gave credit to Gauff, though the world No 1 has continued to face criticism over the past week. Criticism has been particularly notable in the US, where Gauff has been making several TV and media appearances since her historic triumph. Competing at the Queen's Club this week, Keys was asked how she would have responded should Sabalenka or any opponent have made similar comments about a final she had played in. In response, the 30-year-old claimed that she would not “really care” – and expressed her belief that Gauff would feel the same way. Emma Raducanu makes worrying confession as she admits her ‘goals have changed' Lois Boisson gets a warning from respected coach after French Open heroics It's a complicated, emotional moment, and I think sometimes emotions bring everything out of people. Things are said in a way and not necessarily meant seriously. Sabalenka reached the quarter-final of the event last year before retiring with a shoulder injury, ultimately pulling out of Wimbledon, while Gauff reached the last four before falling to Jessica Pegula.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Born to tennis royalty, Draper's supreme work ethic and ascent up the rankings in the past 12 months have been astonishing. Here's why Kieran Jackson believes he poses a serious challenge to Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner for the Wimbledon title To pinpoint the exact moment where British No 1 Jack Draper launched his ascent to the upper echelons of men's tennis, you'd need only go back 12 months this very weekend. That week, as he has since acknowledged, something clicked in his big-hitting, flamboyant lefty game. A few days later, the Brit outgunned Carlos Alcaraz at Queen's. A career-high ranking of world No 4 for the 23-year-old from Sutton. Frustratingly, he will enter Queen's on Monday at No 5, behind Novak Djokovic, with his Stuttgart points dropping off. The summer of '24 was a huge turning point. Draper, the son of former LTA chief executive Roger and ex-British junior tennis champion Nicky, has struggled immensely with injuries and physical fitness since turning professional in 2021. Shoulder and hip issues – remember Andy Murray's issues with the latter – have plagued him, while he has regularly vomited on court in humid conditions. “Coming into last year, the only goal was to stay fit and healthy,” Draper's long-term coach, James Trotman, told the ATP website in March. Interestingly, Draper's short-term coaching trial with South African ex-pro Wayne Ferreira last summer did not last more than a few months, with the Brit ultimately placing complete trust in Trotman, who is double his age at 46. “We were at the point where it didn't matter how good he could be, or was going to be, our focus was to keep him fit. It's challenging to build up trust in your body again. ‘What are we going to do here, Jack? Who are the people we're going to put around you?' Sporting a backwards cap at all times – Lleyton Hewitt-esque – Draper emits something of a braggadocio persona; yet that could not be further from the truth. His heart in the heat of battle has never wavered. “He was very small until the age of 15 or 16. He grew up as a smaller player, having to compete against bigger guys, having to defend and find ways of being competitive against the stronger players who could hit him off the court. All of a sudden, he grows to 6' 4” and he's serving out of a tree and hitting the ball big. A big part of that coaching journey that we're still on today is to try and impose his weapons on the court and take the racquet out of his opponent's hand.” Draper was also able to learn from Murray during the latter stages of his career as part of the Davis Cup team, while showcasing his personality. In fact, not unlike the early stages of Murray's career. Pleasingly, Draper dedicated his most recent off-season, when nursing a hip injury, to his physical conditioning and notably employed a breathing coach. “I had a lot of problems with my sinuses when I was younger so I breathe a lot through my mouth,” explained Draper, having come through three back-to-back five-set matches at the Australian Open in January. “When you are anxious or have long points and you have to recover quickly, it's not efficient to breathe through your mouth. Fast-forward six months, Draper is one of the fittest athletes on tour. The Putney resident was back on court at Queen's ahead of the tournament, hitting with former world No 14 Kyle Edmund, who knows a thing or two about career-impacting injuries. Draper will play just one warm-up tournament, at Queen's, before Wimbledon. While still a step short of Sinner and Alcaraz's insane level of consistency, as shown by their magnificent five-hour-plus Roland-Garros final, the Briton has the potential to cause an upset if either player has an off day. His hard-hitting game is well-suited to the quick nature of grass-court tennis. Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Annabel Croft, one time girls' Wimbledon winner, tennis commentator, pundit and Strictly semi-finalist, recently found a piece of English homework from when she was eleven in 1978. It was entitled “What I Would Like to Do”. “I would like to be able to… win Wimbledon,” she wrote. “Before I get to [sic] old, I would like to dance on stage… before I am to [sic] old I would like to get married because if you are too [sic] old you cannot have children… Also, your husband protects you.” This afternoon, we are sitting at the kitchen island in Croft's six-bedroom neo-classical home, designed by her late husband Mel Coleman twenty five years ago. The house, part of a gated estate in Kingston, is a short drive away from the grass courts of Wimbledon. In 1984, a month before her 18th birthday, she won the girls' junior title. It's hard to square that Croft is now 58-years-old – 59 next month. She doesn't look that different from the press cuttings of thirty-five years ago, which are stacked up in the hallway as she prepares for a 28-date speaking tour about her life this September. Wearing a Me+Em brown linen jumpsuit and mules, she has a baked-in tan (she founded her Annabel Croft academy in Portugal, which Coleman oversaw until he died two years ago). “That was incredible,” she says after Aryna Sabalenka catches out Coco Gauff, before the ultimate glory was claimed by Gauff, who Croft is rooting for to win Wimbledon. Croft spent the first ten days of this year's Roland Garros commentating for BBC Radio Five Live. Tomorrow, two of her three children, Amber Rose, 30 (six months pregnant) and Charlie, 29 (about to get married), are coming over for lunch to watch the men's final between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, a game that lasted 5hr 29 mins; the second longest in grand slam history. Ten members of the women's top 20 will be playing, including Katie Boulter and Emma Raducanu. When I ask if she has “special interests”, she murmurs about Alcaraz and Raducanu, the former for being so utterly brilliant, thought of as the new Nadal, the latter because her trajectory has been so uneven, yet her promise never diminished. It has been two years since Croft did the splits on Strictly, reaching fourth place, dancing with the energy, stamina and natural skill that must initially have surprised both her partner, Johannes Radebe, now one of her best friends, and the judges. It felt like every step was imbued with the emotion of her personal tragedy. Mel Coleman died at Kingston Hospital in May 2023, just 12 weeks after he was diagnosed with Stage four colon cancer, which had spread throughout his body; 97 per cent of his liver was covered with tumours. Her husband of 30 years, they married in 1993 two days before her 27th birthday but they first met when she was just 21; she was in Sri Lanka making a TV show about learning to sail – Coleman was part of the sailing crew. She shows me an old VCR tape: “The moment I first met him and shook his hand is captured right here.” Then, Coleman was an America's Cup and Admiral's Cup sailor, before switching to investment banking. Not long after meeting him Croft made the decision to retire from tennis. She was 21, ranked 24th in the world but had become tired of the tennis life, of hanging around in motels trying to scrabble enough for the bus fare to the next tournament: “I knew I didn't want to live my life as a tennis player until I was 30. I was emotionally intelligent early on to have worked that out.” Sensing the happiness to be found in normal life off the circuit, and given, by then, she was something of a household name, she moved into entertainment: “There wasn't a Sky TV, or Eurosport so I couldn't move straight into commentary. She began doing pantomime: “I needed the panto to give me confidence. Immediately after her retirement in 1988 she took over from Anneka Rice on Channel 4's Treasure Hunt. No one gets up in the morning and thinks ‘I'm going to help Annabel today. “You know he died of sepsis?” she asks me. On his return, he was admitted as an emergency. By July – “literally within a few weeks [of losing him] I was on the phone to my agent. You're giving an interview tomorrow because they are announcing it.' “He's part of the family now,” she says, and shows me a picture of him lined up with her children: “Look! Her 1978 A4 homework is on the table in front of us. It's as though Croft foretold her life, minus the tragedy. “But there is so much to be positive about,” she says. During the tour, she will dance on stage: “I don't want to be a professional widow. Two years on from Strictly, she is in the process of downsizing: “I mean, it's too big!” she says, “it's ridiculous. The house has served its purpose.” She is clearing three decades of family life, including Coleman's possessions, his clothes and shoes. “Mel had always wanted a water view [because of his sailing] and I do too because it will connect me to him.” Croft grew up in Farnborough, Kent, in a comfortable home with two siblings, an older brother and a younger sister. Her parents, James, a chartered surveyor, and Susan, a housewife, were “keen tennis players” but neither of them coaches or professionals. They had a tennis court in the garden but it was at a Spanish hotel tennis tournament that she caught the bug. Her mother then started driving her 20 minutes to Park Langley tennis club in Beckenham, dropping her off “with 50p in my pocket for the cost of my lesson, a packet of crisps and a drink of squash, and I'd stay there all day. She shows me a collection of childhood log books with scores: lists and lists of tennis partners – mostly boys – whom she organised into being her opponents. I met one of those boys recently and he said ‘I used to love coming to you because you always bossed us around and set all the drills. As she started to hit a different league, she missed more and more school: “My dad was always writing requests to the head mistress to ask for time off: ‘Annabel won't be there on Friday, Annabel will miss this week for a tournament'. At fifteen, she moved to Houston, Texas for five years to train with a coach, who was the mixed doubles partner to Billie Jean King.“I travelled around the world six or seven times – that was my education. She plays me an audio clip of a match with “an American girl” at the Albert Hall, with Des Lynam commentating: “I'd had hypnotherapy before that”. Today, there is an added pressure: Raducanu has recently had to deal with a creepy superfan who was evicted the Dubai Tennis Championships, “but [sadly] that comes with the territory,” says Croft. “There's way more security now, but what has changed is the birth of social media. Tennis players today, if they lose matches, get abuse from betting people who are going to lose a lot of money on somebody's match, and then they start attacking the player. I wouldn't have been able to take that.” Her life in retirement was about pushing on, pushing through the pain barrier in a different way: “Sometimes I'd be on the floor with a panic attack [with speaking engagements] but it was Bear Grylls who gave me the best advice. He said “Annabel, don't try to be somebody you are not.” There are photographs in Hello – it's easy to forget how famous she was back then. '” But she's a very long way from thinking of another partner, “I can't think about it at the moment. Coleman was an investment banker for about 18 years, commuting on the tube and sitting behind a desk, but he was “a free-spirited yachtsman” whom Croft says should never have had an office job: “I used to call him Crocodile Dundee.” The white van they converted into “Vannabel” for camping holidays sits on the drive: “It's a difficult one. Coleman's treatment during his illness has left its mark. The news of his imminent death was broken to Croft and the family callously by a nurse, as Coleman lay within earshot. This time, it was Croft who wanted to protect him, the 6ft 4in towering man she nicknamed “Mr Incredible”, who only three months earlier had been entertaining everyone, able to fix everything in the house. The lack of kindness in this worst moment was incomprehensible to her. She says “I have had several meetings since and I've received an apology from the hospital.” She still finds it hard to discuss: “It's such an awful subject. We don't need to talk about it now. Mercifully, she says, in the 12 weeks leading up to Coleman's death, both of them had been supported by Dr Isabella Cooper, a biochemist specialising in mitochondria, leading a team of cancer researchers at Westminster Hospital. Through a strict ketogenic diet (based on eliminating sugar, low carb, meat heavy) Dr Isabella Cooper reduced the tumour coverage on Coleman's liver from 97 per cent to 70 percent. She was the only person who gave Mel hope. And if one positive thing can come out of losing Mel, I would love to give a platform to her work.” She still talks to Cooper every day and now follows a mostly sugar-free diet. She opens her fridge to show me streaky bacon without sugar additives and smoked salmon with no hidden sugars: “I have a huge appetite,” she says. “But I have a very high metabolism and my children say to me ‘slow down'.” There is something very old school about Annabel Croft, much like Wimbledon itself. “The standards at Wimbledon are incredibly high,” she says. However, this year will be the first tournament without human line judges, replaced by AI-powered cameras: “I'm torn. I'd rather have the correct line call if somebody's Grand Slam is riding on a bad call [from a judge]. People do have less attention span and it will speed tennis up, but the line judges are full of personality and it makes tennis entertaining.” I can't draw her to express a view on the thorny issue of trans women competing in female categories. I do think there isn't enough debate anymore – or humour. Croft is a big fan of TCW (formerly called The Conservative Woman) the online magazine and podcast created by her friend Kathy Gyngell to defend freedom of speech and challenge Left-liberal thinking: “I adore her. She is the brightest woman I have ever met. Courage is a good word for Croft too – and resilience: “Ooh I should use that word more.” In the space of two years, she has gone from not knowing how online banking works – “Mel did all of that” – to being able to take the back of the tumble dryer to fix it: “I remember seeing him do it. When it broke down, I went and got his tool box.” Water streamed through the roof shortly after he died – she dealt with that. She can pump up a car tyre as well. I probably would have gone my whole life never doing these things had Mel been around.</p>
