(AP Photo/Etienne Laurent)AP Between international friendly and CONCACAF matches, the United States men's national soccer team has lost its past four games. Channel Finder: DirecTV, Verizon Fios, Cox, Xfinity, Spectrum, Optimum Here's a recent United States soccer story via the Associated Press: Tyler Adams says the U.S. soccer team has tuned out criticism from former players. Landon Donovan and Clint Dempsey, who share the American goals record with 57 each, are among those who have been critical of current regulars not in the struggling roster preparing for the CONCACAF Gold Cup. “We don't talk about that internally as a group,” Adams said Wednesday during a Zoom interview with The Associated Press. Star Christian Pulisic is skipping the June camp and Gold Cup to rest after playing about 120 games for club and country over two seasons. Watching Portugal celebrate its win over Spain in Sunday's European Nations League final, Donovan said on the Fox postgame show: “I can't help but think about our guys on vacation not wanting to play in Gold Cup.” Pulisic has not spoken publicly of his decision. The U.S. has lost four straight games, its longest skid since 2007, following a 4-0 rout Tuesday night by Switzerland. “This is part of the process,” Adams said. More of an overuse thing probably than anything — overload. “Progressing well right now, but just trying to be smart and manage it.” Adams, who captained the U.S. at the 2022 World Cup, funded a pair of mini-pitches at Pulaski Park in Poughkeepsie, New York, near his home in Wappinger. “Before the World Cup hopefully we plan to do one more with a city unnamed yet,” Adams said. “It's something that I think has real impact, continues to grow the sport, serves underserved communities.” Now 26, Adams is feeling back to his old self. “It's definitely enjoyable when you're healthy,” he said. “The 16-to-18 months that it was just on and off inconsistency is something I never had in my career and never had to battle. And then when it hits you and you go through that, you just learn different ways to navigate things, enjoy life, just not take things for granted, all the little things.” Since Mauricio Pochettino took over as U.S. coach last fall, players have had more autonomy to break away from rigid positioning employed by his predecessor, Gregg Berhalter. “Maurizio gives the players freedom to find spots they're comfortable in and see how they can affect the game in different ways. So, yeah, I think he gives everyone freedom, but there's still structure to the way that we want to play.” Adams will be with the U.S. team in Austin, Texas, next Wednesday, and following intently when the Premier League releases its 2025-26 schedule at 3 a.m. CDT. He feels improved because of his time with Leeds in 2022-23 and Bournemouth the past two seasons. “After you play in the Premier League, every game feels slow,'” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bayern Munich have thrashed Auckland City 10-0 in Cincinnati in the first match of day two at the 2025 Club World Cup. Kingsley Coman had a hat-trick, Michael Olise, Jamal Musiala and Thomas Muller each scored twice and Sacha Boey got the other. The games keep coming thick and fast on the first Club World Cup Sunday and there are just 30 minutes until kick-off between Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid at Rose Bowl. We are covering every kick of that match here on The Athletic, so we would love it if you could join us. You can access our live coverage of that huge match by following this link. Lots of people watching that 10-0 win for Bayern making the same observation: there is a real chance we will similar mismatches at next summer's World Cup. The expansion from 32 teams to 48 means that some less accomplished nations are getting the chance to compete and that could spell problems, like the ones we have just seen for Auckland City. We know that these are the final days of Thomas Muller's 25-year affiliation with Bayern Munich. So for him to add two more goals to his tally this afternoon felt pretty important for the 35-year-old. And his second strike brought up an impressive milestone as he moved onto 250 goals for the German giants. If you'd told me Bayern Munich were going to rack up 10 goals today, then I would have expected Harry Kane to have got his name on the scoresheet three or four times. So for him to completely miss out on the goals — and assists — is a real shock and perhaps an indication of the toll a long season has taken on him. Vincent Kompany will hope that his goal drought will not extend too much further into the tournament as he will need to be heavily involved if Bayern are to go all the way over the next few weeks. In line with Adam Crafton's point earlier on, there has been a lot of criticism in Spain, mostly from Barcelona fans, about the fact that Barca or Liverpool are not in the tournament. I am going to go out on a limb and say the next game at this Club World Cup won't be as one sided as the one we have just watched. Luis Enrique's newly crowned UEFA Champions League winners are facing Diego Simeone's Atletico Madrid and we are already covering that match live. You can join the fun by clicking here. Auckland City were under no illusion about what would happen here. Among them, there's a new all-weather surface being built in their district which, when completed, will serve the local schools. They can finally haul their tired bodies off the turf at TQL Stadium. Credit to Bayern Munich for a very professional job and they, unsurprisingly, hold the record for the biggest win in Club World Cup history. I've got no idea why there will be five more minutes of this game, but there will be as advertised by the fourth official. Muller, clearly not feeling sorry for his opponents, celebrated his side's 10th goal with a huge roar in the direction of the Bayern supporters inside TQL Stadium. I reckon there are still plenty of them who want to see an 11th goal in this period of stoppage time... Muller has his second goal and Bayern have double figures. No one was expecting much at all from Auckland City, but this has felt pretty cruel. These two teams should not be playing against each other, particularly not in a tournament billed as the world's best teams going up against each other. Can Bayern make it 10-0 in the last throes? I have praised Conor Tracey a few times in this live occasion after a string of decent saves, but that is unforgiveable. The Auckland City goalkeeper literally passed the ball straight to Musiala a yard or two outside his penalty area. And Bayern move closer to the double-figure victory as substitute Musiala completes his hat-trick! Finally, Auckland City have had a shot at this Club World Cup! Another promising counter-attack, this time with substitute Angus Kilkolly racing down the left wing. With no one in support, and with Bayern defenders converging on him from everywhere, he went for the spectacular. As a Leicester City fan, I take great pleasure in saying that I have seen a 9-0 win, when my beloved team stuffed Southampton on the road back in 2019. I have still yet to see a team score 10 goals in one game — Bayern have another quarter of an hour or so to make that happen. An eighth goal for Bayern Munich and their first from the penalty spot today. It was, once again, Manickum who led the counter-attack and his pass was much better this time around. But all he could was help it on its way past him.</p>

England lacked inspiration despite fielding stars like Nwaneri and Elliott, but Tino Livramento and James Beadle were among those who impressed.

England Under-21s were held to a draw in their second European Championship fixture as Slovenia deservedly earned a point on a baking evening in Nitra, Slovakia.

Lee Carsley's side started in sloppy fashion as Slovenia went close on a few occasions, with one effort deflecting wide before Svit Seslar's overhead kick landed on the roof of the net. James McAtee had the Young Lions' first real sight of goal but could only drag his effort comfortably wide before Nwanneri failed to connect with Jonathan Rowe's fizzing low cross from point-blank range.

Positive signs began to emerge towards half-time as Harvey Elliott hit the woodwork and the start to the second half offered more encouragement as McAtee forced Martin Turk into a smart save before instinctively firing the rebound wide.

Carsley showed no fear in introducing fresh faces from the bench but no breakthrough arrived, leaving England on four points in Group B ahead of their next game against Germany on Wednesday..

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a grueling club soccer season, it was tough to know how some of the biggest European teams would approach the Club World Cup but Bayern Munich delivered an answer in their first group stage game, dismantling amateur Auckland City FC 10-0. It's a record win for a team taking part in the Club World Cup as Bayern surpassed Al-Hilal's 6-1 victory over Al Jazira in 2021. No team has ever scored more goals than Bayern's nine in a Club World Cup match either. With the tournament being expanded to 32 teams for this edition in the United States, this is a record that may not stand for long, but that won't matter for Bayern Munich after kicking off the tournament in style. They didn't even need involvement from Harry Kane to reach that mark, with the attack going through the amateur side with ease. After only winning the Bundesliga this past season, Vincent Kompany is one of the managers whose side could use a Club World Cup to establish themselves as contenders for the Champions League next season. Kompany has been able to get time for new recruit Jonathan Tah to work his way into the defense after joining from Bayer Leverkusen. Tah will be a large part of any Bayern Munich success next season, so having a tournament like the Club World Cup for him to get into the team is quite important. Jamal Musiala was also able to net a hat trick in the second half of play in his return from a hamstring injury that kept him out at the end of the season. | What a hit from @JamalMusiala to make it 7-0!WATCH Bayern Munich-Auckland City in the @FIFACWC NOW! | June 14 - July 13 | Every Game | Free | https://t.co/i0K4eUtwwb | #FIFACWC #TakeItToTheWorld #BAYAKL pic.twitter.com/vmJS8dnYw1 No matter what the score was, Bayern didn't let up on the pressure as every player was hungry for a goal. Auckland City FC still had an unforgettable moment despite the score, but with this being a tournament where they also want to pick up points, it's important to have a short memory and put this behind them because there are still important fixtures to play following this match.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup starts this weekend, and the United States Men's National Team's path to an eighth Gold Cup title kicks off Sunday, June 15 in San Jose, California against Trinidad and Tobago. The USMNT will continue their group stage with back-to-back matches in Texas against Saudi Arabia on Thursday, June 19 and Haiti on Sunday, June 22. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino released his 26-player roster last week, and it includes a mix of familiar faces and young talent. Miles Robinson, the hero for the United States in the 2021 Gold Cup final victory over Mexico, appears alongside other stalwart defenders such as Walker Zimmerman, Tim Ream and goalkeeper Matt Turner. Historically, the United States has dominated the group stage, totaling a 40-1-5 record and winning their group in 16 out of 17 Gold Cups, including the most recent competition in 2023. The United States has dominated the series against Trinidad and Tobago, winning 17 of 18 meetings on American soil. At Port of Spain, the capital city of Trinidad and Tobago, the Americans played more than 50 minutes down to 10 men, and Trinidad and Tobago took advantage to record a 2-1 win. With a win Sunday, the United States could equal its longest home winning streak against any opponent, tying with Ecuador, which the U.S. has beaten 16 consecutive times. ET at PayPal Park (San Jose, Calif.) The United States has only faced Saudi Arabia once in the past five years, a scoreless draw in an international friendly in September 2022. Before then, Saudi Arabia appeared in the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar where it most notably shocked the soccer world and defeated Argentina early in the group stage, handing the eventual and current reigning World Cup champions their only loss of the tournament. Saudi Arabia enters the Gold Cup still alive in qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, earning a result in three of their last four AFC qualifying matches. The two nations have met four times in Gold Cup action, and the USA has never lost, earning three wins and one draw. The Gold Cup quarterfinals will be held June 28-June 29 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz. and U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis. The semifinals take place July 2 at Energizer Park in St. Louis and Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. Sixteen teams will look to make it to Houston, Texas where the final will be played at NRG Stadium on July 6. Mexico won the last time around in 2023, beating a Panama side that outlasted the United States in penalty kicks in the semis. The Americans won the Gold Cup prior in 2021, swiping the trophy from Mexico thanks to Robinson's epic game-winning header in extra time. A post shared by U.S. Soccer MNT (@usmnt)</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are no new alerts at this time The debate that roiled soccer fans for generations was also its most unanswerable: Which clubs, on which continents, played the best soccer? Unlike national teams that played one another in the quadrennial World Cup, there was rarely overlap between the top teams in Europe and South America, or North America, except for summertime “friendly” competitions. It now features 32 teams, from six continents, playing for a total prize money pool of $1 billion. “This is for bragging rights,” said Jill Ellis, the chief football officer of FIFA, soccer's global governing body, and a former World Cup-winning coach of the U.S. women's national team. But most importantly, this is a chance to be the first-ever club world champion.” Falling ticket prices, and accusations from Major League Soccer players that the league had agreed to participate in a “cash grab” that unfairly compensates them, have raised the question of just how much buy-in the new tournament has from U.S. audiences and players. When tickets for Saturday's opening game in Florida between Inter Miami, featuring Lionel Messi, and Egyptian side Al Ahly went on sale in December through Ticketmaster, an upper-deck ticket cost $379 at the time. According to NPR, FIFA has worked with a local Florida college to offer four complimentary tickets for students who pay for a single $20 ticket. Bayern Munich, the perennial German champion, listed lower-bowl tickets for its opener Sunday in Cincinnati for as low as $107 when its tickets went on sale in December; on Saturday, tickets were being resold on Stubhub for half that. "We anticipace great attendances and electric atmospheres at its inaugural edition, with excitement growing with every round of matches and the tournament ultimately standing as the undisputed pinnacle of club world football," FIFA said, in part of a statement sent to NBC News. "The appetite speaks for itself: fans from over 130 countries have already purchased tickets. The top 10 markets are led by the United States, followed by Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Canada, France, Japan, Switzerland, Germany and Portugal — a clear sign of global anticipation and reach." Instead, it has offered a historic amount of prize money, with $525 million of the total $1 billion distributed to teams on a sliding scale, guaranteed, just for making the 32-team field. At the top, brand-name European teams such as Real Madrid, Manchester City, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain will earn between $12.8 and $38 million; at the bottom, New Zealand's Auckland City FC will earn $3.5 million. The winner can ultimately rake in up to $125 million, all of which adds up to much more than bragging rights — which has left Major League Soccer players asking why their cut from the windfall isn't greater. Before a June 1 match players from the Seattle Sounders donned white T-shirts during warmups that read “Club World Ca$h Grab,” with an image of the Mr. The three teams in the Club World Cup field from Major League Soccer — Seattle, Inter Miami and Los Angeles Football Club — are each guaranteed $9.55 million for participating, before any bonuses are earned for performance. Players' earnings from participation or performance in a “compulsory tournament or noncompulsory tournament” is capped at $1 million, per the terms of the league's collective bargaining agreement. The players' union has continued to push publicly to increase' players stake from what is currently about a 90/10 split, and has noted that before a major tournament in 2024, the players and MLS renegotiated the prize money distribution before ultimately landing at a 50-50 split. In a statement to NBC News on Thursday, MLS said that it has “agreed to voluntarily provide additional performance-based compensation to players from the three participating clubs.” That proposal, the league said, would allocate 20% of all prize money earned from the group stage onward to players. “If an MLS club wins the Club World Cup, its players would collectively receive more than $24 million in performance bonuses,” the statement read. “MLS club owners believe performance-based incentives are appropriate given the expanded format and increased prize pool for the Club World Cup. The League values the continued dedication and commitment of its players and looks forward to supporting them as they represent their clubs — and Major League Soccer — on the global stage this summer.” “I don't think sitting out is an option,” Seattle midfielder Albert Rusnak told reporters Friday. Ellis, who works for FIFA, believes the prospect of playing on that global stage will lead to strong competition from players. Sure, do they want to be paid as much as probably — I mean, that's within their own league and within the MLS to determine that, because obviously, unlike a lot of leagues around the world, MLS has a salary cap,” Ellis said. “But I think in terms of what I and my experience in working with some of the best players in the world, elite players want to play against elite players. Listen, at the end of the day it's a choice, but I think players will want to play in this event. Andrew Greif is a sports reporter for NBC News Digital.</p>

The U.S. men's national team is short-handed and under intense scrutiny as it kicks off its 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup campaign with a game against Trinidad and Tobago.

The USMNT's biggest star, Christian Pulisic, will controversially be rested for the tournament, while other big names like Weston McKennie are instead obliged to play at the overlapping FIFA Club World Cup. Making matters worse, a 4-0 embarrassment at the hands of Switzerland on Tuesday served as a reminder that entry-level basics in terms of intensity and effort have been in question for some time now.

Manager Mauricio Pochettino — who came in at significant expense after the U.S. badly underwhelmed at the 2024 Copa América — has run into the same sorts of issues that sunk his predecessor, Gregg Berhalter. On a four-game losing streak for the first time since 2007, the USMNT is under pressure to produce a comfortable win over the Soca Warriors.

Here is what to know for Sunday's Gold Cup game between the USMNT and Trinidad and Tobago:

The Concacaf Gold Cup group stage game pairing the USMNT with Trinidad and Tobago is set for 6 p.m. ET, with PayPal Park in San Jose, Calif. hosting.

Ryan De Vries and Angus Kilkolly replace David Yoo and Dylan Manickum in another Auckland City double change. Dylan Manickum is in space deep in the Bayern half and he picks the right pass over to David Yoo but he opts to cut inside in the box but Dayot Upamecano gets back and mops up the danger. That was the best chance Auckland City have had so far. Bayern have now become the first side to score seven goals in any format of the Club World Cup. #bbcfootball, via WhatsApp on 03301231826 or text 81111 (UK only, standard message rates apply) Huge chance to be the tournament's top goal scorer when you're playing against a team like this. Auckland City look to their bench for the first time as Nathan Lobo and Gerard Garriga make way for Jerson Lagos and Tong Zhou. Jamal Musiala turns on to his left foot on the edge of the box and slips it through to Serge Gnabry but he didn't get enough on his strike to make it seven. Auckland City may have conceded six goals but they did manage to keep England skipper Harry Kane out and limited him to just 13 touches of the ball. Imagine being a tiring Auckland City player and seeing Jamal Musiala coming on... Some lovely intricate play from Bayern as Raphael Guerreiro gets to the byline and cuts it back but there is Mario Ilich to clear. Bayern are very much playing with their foot off the gas here but we know what can happen if they decide to turn it on for a moment as Thomas Muller leathers one towards goal but it's always rising. I was certain that was going in for 7-0 but Conor Tracey reacts well to Serge Gnabry's curling effort and tips it behind. The levels always have to be high at Bayern. #bbcfootball, via WhatsApp on 03301231826 or text 81111 (UK only, standard message rates apply) This is not really that entertaining, even with all the goals. I'm away to read my book in the garden with a cool beer. The commentator says Lennart Karl has been compared to Thomas Muller and Mesut Ozil.

Kendry Paez has flown to the United States to train with Chelsea despite not being named in their Club World Cup squad, in a bid to impress Enzo Maresca. 

The expectation remains that Paez, the 18-year-old Ecuadorian described as a wonderkid, will leave on loan this summer. 

He was signed on a pre-agreement at the age of 16 for £17million, and Chelsea's sister club Strasbourg is his likeliest destination. 

While it is understood Paez's preference would be to be around Chelsea's first team over the next season, the club are considering what is best for his progress.

Andrey Santos has been used as an example over how a temporary stay at Strasbourg can benefit beneficial, with the 21-year-old Brazilian among those in their Club World Cup squad in the United States. 

Chelsea flew to Philadelphia on Friday to begin their prep for FIFA's expanded club competition. 

Their first game will be against Los Angeles FC in Atlanta on Monday when Liam Delap is expected to make his debut after signing from Ipswich for £30million. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Christian Pulisic made a debatable but reasonable decision last month to skip the Gold Cup, and that, he surely hoped, would be that. His body and mind were “talking” to him. They needed a full offseason to recharge ahead of next year's World Cup. He could play two friendlies for the U.S. men's national team in June, but a monthlong tournament? And that, we learned this week, was the only time that Pulisic and Pochettino, the team's star and renowned boss, have spoken over the past month. In separate media appearances on Thursday and Saturday, they implicitly revealed discord that will now linger around the USMNT for a while. Pulisic, in response to the criticism, pointedly disclosed in a podcast interview with CBS Sports that he'd asked to play in this month's friendlies against Türkiye and Switzerland, but that coaches “said no." Pulisic, 26, who has captained the USMNT dozens of times, added: “That's coach's decision, I fully respect that. Pochettino, speaking Saturday ahead of the USMNT's Gold Cup opener, responded: “Players don't need to understand or not understand. They cannot dictate the plan, because if [so], we invert, we swap positions, no? … We explain why we decide not to include [him] in the friendly games, and then if you have some problems — that is not my problem, [for him] to understand or not understand.” With every comment Thursday and Saturday, the two stoked an already flammable situation. Pulisic admitted, when asked, that Pochettino's lack of communication, while not “an issue,” has been “slightly different” than his relationship with previous national team coaches. Pochettino indirectly responded that he couldn't keep in regular touch with 60 players, as if Pulisic were just another one of the 60. Pochettino insisted that “communication is good with [Pulisic], like another [player].” But his insistence on treating Pulisic like any other player seems to be one source of a disconnect between the two. Pulisic is the most famous and successful men's soccer player that the U.S. has ever produced. He's undoubtedly the USMNT's most important, and previous coaches have managed him as such. Pulisic once told a story about Pochettino's predecessor, Gregg Berhalter, calling him to the coach's office late at night after a friendly in which Pulisic had scored but also picked up an injury. Berhalter challenged Pulisic, and suggested that perhaps he needed to “train harder,” but not in a confrontational way; in a caring way. That episode, during his first camp with Berhalter, made a lasting impression on him. Interpersonal and special treatment, though, can privilege a star. In March, during the CONCACAF Nations League third-place match, when Pochettino chose to replace Pulisic with Tanner Tessmann, Pulisic appeared to wave off the sub so that he could take a free kick. And a few months later, he doesn't sound pleased that Pulisic opted out of the Gold Cup — although he has publicly defended Pulisic's decision, and said he "understands" it, and called him “a very talented player” and “a very nice guy.” “The people need to prioritize the national team,” Pochettino told USMNT legends Landon Donovan and Tim Howard on their podcast recently. Even Messi, even Neymar, even Mbappé for France, these guys are desperate to go to the national team.” Pulisic, he said, "should be our Messi." And on Saturday, he didn't sound pleased with Pulisic's Thursday interview. He reinforced that he — the $6 million coach who's worked at levels that none of his U.S. players ever have — is in control, and that no single player is bigger than him or the collective — or the player next to him. If he performs well and he is the best, it's normal he's going to have a place in the national team.” But a player wouldn't just play because he says: “‘I want to play,' ‘I want to this,' ‘I want to that,'" Pochettino added. “When I signed my contract [with] the federation, I am the head coach,” he said.</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Well, this was at least a first. On a clammy, boisterous, vaguely hallucinogenic night at the Hard Rock Stadium, the opening act of Fifa's billion-dollar death star, the newly bulked and tanned Club World Cup, did produce something new. This was surely the first major sporting event where the opening ceremony was infinitely more entertaining, and indeed comprehensible as a basic human activity, than the sporting spectacle that followed. By the end, the best team in Africa, Al Ahly, had drawn 0-0 with a largely incoherent Inter Miami, who looked in the first half like they had a dim idea what this sport is meant to look like, but who were also struggling through a terrible wall-eyed hangover to remember which way is forward. The second half was better, mainly because some element of the Lionel Messi identity began to assert itself, a muscle memory of genius, like watching the aged Frank Sinatra still tootling out That's Life on stage in Vegas, still drawing huge gales of applause for nodding a lot and pointing at the crowd. This was the only significant emotion here: a deep sadness at seeing this spectacle play out, the post-Messi Messi, wheeled on to this stage of fakery, an instrument of sporting beauty weaponised in his dotage to promote a power grab. Actually that sounds a bit too exciting. This thing isn't really built to be a robust sporting entity. It is simply product, an attempt to capture a global market. It's the projection of a single random Swiss administrator. Although, to be fair, lots of things that were supposed to be bad were actually fine here. The Fifa marketing machine is a juggernaut. Americans are good at turning up to stuff. And mainly it was never going to be empty because Messi was here, Miami loves Messi, and America loves stars. The Hard Rock is a castle-on-the-hill kind of structure, with its crisp, white, flying roof, dumped down in a vast expanse of shimmering tarmac. The great Sir David appeared, looking graver now, hands folded like the fourth Earl of Sandwich, producing one of those expensive-looking regal waves, not really a wave at all, just a power-flex. A DJ played club tunes, which was fun and infectious and gleefully received, not because of Fifa or football but because this is Miami and something about the air, the heat, the light, just makes this a place of fun and pleasure and show, and because Miami is full of beautiful glowing people who look like they're probably eternal. The ceremony was good, not the stiff, mannered stuff these affairs often dish up, but loads of people dancing and playing horns and looking like they actually enjoy doing this. A terrifying horror movie-style voice shouted “take it to the worrrlllldd”, in a manner that suggested its owner was in the process of being expertly throttled. Messi was last out on to the pitch. Watching him you got that feeling of a truly great footballer who can still see it all, but just can't call the shapes into being, Mozart with tinnitus, Hemingway staggering about the Florida Keys in his soggy late days, still feeling his own greatness, still the matador, even while he's sinking pisco sours in a crab shack There was something frustrating and even slightly offensive about seeing Messi like this. It expresses perfectly the deeply manipulative nature of this event, of owners and political interests who will take that thing you love and use it to move the world around, who know you simply cannot resist. Al Ahly should have scored at least twice in the opening 20 minutes. Messi woke up in the second half. They might have won, or at least scored. Otherwise, Saturday in America was a day for a divisive, autocratic president to stage his own hugely overblown and narcissistic Grand Parade. It was in the end a pathetic spectacle and, in every sense of the word, the ghost of something great and pure and much-loved, out there being sold back to you like an empty replica shirt.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MIAMI, Florida -- Inter Miami CF and Al Ahly played out a 0-0 draw in front of a healthy crowd on the opening night of FIFA's Club World Cup on Saturday. Egyptian side Al Ahly had the best opportunity to find a goal, but Trézéguet saw a first-half penalty saved by Miami goalkeeper Oscar Ustari, who had an outstanding opening 45 minutes. Lionel Messi, starting the game just four days after appearing for Argentina in the World Cup qualifier against Colombia, was brighter after half-time and almost helped Miami snatch a winner. Despite fears over a low attendance ahead of kick-off, more than 60,000 fans came to watch the opening game of the newly expanded tournament. When a squad headlined by Messi and Luis Suárez takes the field, few expect for anyone else to shine. However, goalkeeper Ustari managed to steal the show from his world-renowned teammates against Al Ahly in the Club World Cup opener. Inter Miami's defensive struggles exposed Ustari to the speed of Al Ahly's forwards, forcing the goalkeeper into a number of perfectly timed saves. Though the 38-year-old joined Inter Miami in September 2024, Ustari only recently became the starting goalkeeper after Drake Callender suffered a long-term injury in January. The goalkeeper deserves recognition for his performance, but his starring role against Al Ahly probably only exposes Inter Miami's weaknesses. Ustari may not be enough to save the team's struggling defense and injury-laden roster from Group A's other opponents, FC Porto and Palmeiras. Al Ahly were by far the better team in the first half, but just couldn't find a goal. As early as the eighth minute, Inter Miami's defence was being cut open when Emam Ashour went clean through. Wessam Abou Ali thought he'd scored after 30 minutes but his effort was ruled out for offside. It was just before the break when Ustari capped off an impressive first-half performance by saving Trezeguet's penalty. Despite Inter Miami's better second half, Al Ahly will feel like they've missed an opportunity. Group A is one of the more modest and there's a realistic chance for any of the four teams to qualify. Al Ahly will now likely need to beat either Palmeiras or Porto to qualify and after drawing with Miami -- a task that won't be easy. After an opening draw in a game they probably should have won, it will be uphill from here. There were empty seats scattered throughout the tiers -- the attendance was announced as 60,927 with Hard Rock's capacity around 65,000 -- but the crowd was big enough for FIFA to count it as a success. They were helped by thousands of supporters wearing Al Ahly colours. There were as many red shirts as pink Inter Miami ones and the Egyptian fans were far louder. Despite FIFA's insistence that this is a serious competition, there was still a pre-season feel about some of it. The players were individually introduced before running onto the pitch ahead of the kick-off and at half-time a collection of football legends faced off against YouTuber IShowSpeed in a crossbar challenge. Ref cam was a positive addition to the coverage. The camera attached to Australian A-League Men official Alireza Faghani gave a close up of his view when he awarded a first-half penalty to Al Ahly, subsequently missed by former Aston Villa forward Trezeguet.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a poor start to June, the U.S. men's national team is kicking off its 2025 Gold Cup campaign against Trinidad and Tobago. Just a few months ago, the USMNT would have been one of the favorites to dethrone Mexico as Gold Cup champions. Except the Stars and Stripes' best players, including Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson, Folarin Balogun and Sergiño Dest, are missing out on this summer's tournament due to injury or personal reasons. The pressure is on Mauricio Pochettino to get the USMNT back to winning ways against Trinidad and Tobago, but he might have to do so without Tyler Adams, who is still dealing with a foot injury. GK: Matt Freese—The NYCFC shot-stopper is set to return to the starting lineup after Matt Turner conceded four goals against Switzerland. CB: Chris Richards—Richards will hope to translate his stellar season for Crystal Palace to this summer's tournament for the United States. CB: Mark McKenzie—The center back will be eager to put in a better shift just four days after the Stars and Stripes' embarrassing defensive performance at GEODIS Park. LB: Max Arfsten—Although he is at his best as a left wing-back, Arfsten will have to focus on his defensive responsibilities for the USMNT. DM: Johnny Cardoso—Cardoso put together an impressive campaign for Real Betis this past season, but has struggled to perform under Pochettino. He should have little trouble finding success against Trinidad and Tobago's leaky backline. AM: Malik Tillman—The midfielder is coming off a career-best season with PSV in which he bagged 16 goals in the team's Eredivisie-winning campaign. Tillman has been one of the bright spots for an undermanned USMNT side in June. ST: Brian White—White is third in the MLS Golden Boot race with 10 goals in 12 appearances for the Vancouver Whitecaps. The striker will hope to impress in what could be just his fifth international cap.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SAN JOSE, Calif. — By now, you may have heard that Christian Pulisic isn't with the U.S. men's national team preparing for the Concacaf Gold Cup, which the Americans kick off on Sunday against Trinidad and Tobago (coverage begins at 6 p.m. But before and after the USMNT went through its final pre-tournament training session on Saturday, Pulisic's absence continued to be a hot topic. For the uninitiated, Pulisic asked not to participate in the Gold Cup because of fatigue following two grueling seasons with Italian club AC Milan. That decision was roundly criticized by a number of former U.S. legends, most notably Landon Donovan. On Thursday, Pulisic finally explained his reasoning during an interview with CBS Sports, and revealed that he wanted to play in this month's two pre-Gold Cup exhibitions versus Türkiye and Switzerland. Pochettino, who wanted to use the same squad all summer, turned him down. "That's the coach's decision," Pulisic said. During his pregame press conference on Saturday, I asked Pochettino about Pulisic's comments. The former Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham Hotspur manager didn't hold back. "Players don't need to understand," Pochettino said. They cannot dictate the plan. "He explained why he only wanted to be involved in two games and not the Gold Cup, and I respect that," added Pochettino. But I do need that he understands our decision. Pulisic also told CBS, whose parent company produces a documentary series on him, that he hasn't spoken with Pochettino much since the Argentine was hired last September on a contract through next summer's World Cup. "He understood kind of where I was coming from, and that' as much conversation as I've had with him." Pochettino said that he makes sure not to talk to any particular player more than any other, so it doesn't seem like he's playing favorites. "I love to be in communication with my players," the 53-year-old said. The United States has lost its last four matches under Mauricio Pochettino. A few hours earlier, before the Americans trained in nearby Santa Clara ahead of Sunday's match at PayPal Park, home of the San Jose Earthquakes, U.S. veteran Chris Richards was asked about what has become a public feud between Pulisic and Donovan. So we just focus on the people who are here and who are ready to win. That's been kind of our big message." For a team that enters the regional championship having lost four consecutive games, beating the Soca Warriors has to be where all their energy and attention is directed. "I think in the last few months, we've had a lot of people talking kind of down on the team, which is okay," Richards said. So we kind of take that and it gives us motivation to, hopefully, change the narrative."
