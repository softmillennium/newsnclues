                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump vetoed an Israeli plan to kill Iran‘s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, U.S. officials told Reuters and The Associated Press (AP). Until they do we're not even talking about going after the political leadership,” an anonymous U.S. official told Reuters, which first reported the news. Israel has launched strikes against Iran, killing at least 406 people and wounding 654, according to Washington-based Human Rights Activists, the AP reported. In retaliation, Iran launched missile strikes on Israel, some of which penetrated the nation's Iron Dome missile defense and landed in Tel Aviv. Trump posted Sunday about the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran in a message on Truth Social. He added, “We will have PEACE, soon, between Israel and Iran! I do a lot, and never get credit for anything, but that's OK, the PEOPLE understand. “If we are attacked in any way, shape or form by Iran, the full strength and might of the U.S. Armed Forces will come down on you at levels never seen before,” he threatened. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has said that if Israel stops its assault, then “our responses will also stop.” “The issue here is stopping those things that will threaten our survival. “Now, if they are willing to accept President Trump's terms, that's another matter.” Internet Trolls Around the World Are Mocking Trump's Military Birthday Parade If Iran does not agree to Trump's demands, then Netanyahu said the conflict will “end when we remove those capacities, and we will.” Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shakira is opening up about her experience as an immigrant living in the United States under President Donald Trump's immigration policies. “I was only 19 when I moved to the U.S., like many other Colombian immigrants who come to this country looking for a better future,” Shakira said, noting that she read works by Leonard Cohen, Walt Whitman and Bob Dylan to learn English and understand the craft of songwriting. Since stepping back into office earlier this year, the president has intensified efforts to combat alleged immigration violations, prompting protests in Los Angeles and across the country in response to raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). She added, “Now, more than ever, we have to remain united. Now, more than ever, we have to raise our voices and make it very clear that a country can change its immigration policies, but the treatment of all people must always be humane.” In early February, while accepting the Grammy Award for best Latin pop album for 2024's Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran, Shakira dedicated the honor to “all my immigrant brothers and sisters in this country,” adding, “You're loved, worth it and I will always fight with you.” Shakira is among a growing number of musicians speaking out against federal immigration raids in Southern California. “I've lived in LA my whole life and I'm deeply upset about these violent deportations of my neighbors under the current administration,” Rodrigo wrote on her Instagram Story on Saturday (June 14). Treating hardworking community members with such little respect, empathy, and due process is awful.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Internet trolls are making a mockery of Donald Trump‘s beloved military parade that took place Saturday in Washington, D.C., on the president's birthday, though it was ostensibly in honor of the U.S. Army's 250th birthday. Accounts on X (formerly Twitter) shared video of other countries' military parades with soldiers marching in synchronized lockstep surrounded by enthusiastic and large crowds, comparing them to the spectacle in D.C. on Saturday. One account, which Puck News' Julia Ioffe identified as Russian, juxtaposed footage of members of the North Korean military marching in exact sync, comparing it to video of U.S. Army troops marching in Trump's parade accompanied by much less fanfare. “How Trump imagined his parade [vs] What he actually saw,” the caption read, according to Ioffe. (Captions: "How Trump imagined his parade / What he actually saw") https://t.co/smjZZeE24n One account posted video of Mexico's annual Mexican Independence Day parade in Mexico City, while another shared footage of India's Republic Day parade. As well countless countries from around the world fly all over to march in theirs. Contingents of Indian Armed Forces marching past at Kartavya Path, New Delhi. Trump has praised other countries for their military parades. Washington Post columnist Karen Tumulty pointed out that Trump's admiration of military spectacle goes even farther back. Before he was inaugurated to his first term, Trump told Tumulty in an interview, “We're going to show the people as we build up our military, we're going to display our military.” “That military may come marching down Pennsylvania Avenue,” Trump continued. “That military may be flying over New York City and Washington, D.C., for parades. I mean, we're going to be showing our military.” ICE Will Pause Farm, Restaurant Raids After Trump Social Media Post Meanwhile, as Trump was celebrating his the Army's birthday in D.C., which reportedly cost up to $45 million, masses of people that dwarfed the parade turnout showed up across the country for No Kings protests against him.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After delivering a crowd pleaser with one of her latest characters, Ego Nwodim was just as shocked as the FCC likely was by the audience's response. The Saturday Night Live star recalled the on-air reaction to her Miss Eggy character “did throw me for a loop” after a call-and-response bit inadvertently caused the crowd to yell “s—” during a Season 50 episode that aired in April. “We did not think they were going to say anything because, if we did think so, and if we thought what they were going to say was going to be a curse word, it would have been flagged and it would have been taken out of the sketch,” she explained to Collider. “Even if I would have loved for it to stay, and I would have no control over it. So the second time we did Miss Eggy, we couldn't do ‘because these men ain't what?' We might have even tried to, or we talked about it, and standards and practices was like, ‘No, you can't do that, because we know what the audience is going to do. Whether the NBC sketch comedy show was fined by the FCC, Nwodim said, “I don't know. I don't know if we got fined. It was like a little dance with the audience. The FCC's own guidelines may have provided SNL with a reprieve, outlining that “indecent and profane content are prohibited on broadcast TV and radio between 6am and 10pm, when there is a reasonable risk that children may be in the audience,” whereas the show begins airing at 11:30pm ET. Aided by a slight delay, the West Coast and Mountain SNL broadcasts' cleansing of the “s—” would appear to have handled any FCC backlash for the show, which airs in primetime in those regions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Olivia Rodrigo is adding her voice to the growing outcry over federal immigration raids in Southern California. The 22-year-old pop star and actress, who grew up in Temecula, Calif., before moving to Los Angeles in middle school to star in the Disney Channel series Bizaardvark, took to social media on Saturday (June 14) amid widespread protests. The demonstrations erupted in response to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids targeting multiple workplaces across L.A., citing alleged immigration violations. “I've lived in LA my whole life and I'm deeply upset about these violent deportations of my neighbors under the current administration,” Rodrigo wrote on her Instagram Story. Treating hardworking community members with such little respect, empathy, and due process is awful. Rodrigo isn't the only music star raising her voice in response to the recent ICE raids and National Guard presence in Los Angeles. Many California officials have denounced the deployment as unconstitutional and inflammatory. “F—K ICE,” Tyler wrote on his Instagram Story, sharing a clip from the 2002 film Paid in Full in which the phrase is chanted repeatedly. Finneas also spoke out after claiming he was tear-gassed while attending what he described as a “very peaceful” protest in downtown L.A.  “Tear-gassed almost immediately at the very peaceful protest downtown. They're inciting this,” the Grammy-winning artist and producer posted June 8 on his Instagram Story.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SUNDAY UPDATE, Refresh for latest…: Universal's How to Train Your Dragon led the charge at the global and international box office this weekend as Hiccup and Toothless winged in with a $197.8M start worldwide. Of that, $114.1M (which includes previews) is from 81 overseas markets — a smidge lower than where we saw it landing yesterday, which is nothing to snort about, and is above pre-weekend projections. The Dean DeBlois-directed live-action take on the beloved animated franchise's first entry, HTTYD has terrific word of mouth, setting it up for a strong run. It notched the 4th best global opening of the year so far, behind A Minecraft Movie, Lilo & Stitch and China's Ne Zha 2. 'How To Train Your Dragon' Fires Up Franchise Best $83M+ Opening After 'A' CinemaScore; 'Materialists' At $12M Is A24's Third Biggest Opening - Sunday Update Peter Bart: George Clooney And Tom Cruise Building Strong Third Acts For Their Careers Uni kicked off international release with previews across more than 6,600 locations and 13,000 screens (including 339 Imax). Fifty-one of those began previews last weekend, starting with Korea on June 6; a further 10 markets began previews this week, capitalizing on the Whit Monday holiday in several territories. Disney's Lilo & Stitch, which crossed $800M global during the week, is now at $858.4M through Sunday on its way to becoming the first Hollywood movie of 2025 to cross $1B. The Top 5 markets to date are: Mexico ($61.8M), UK ($45.1M), France ($35.2M), Brazil ($31.8M) and Germany ($27M). Meanwhile, there was another new milestone for Paramount/Skydance's Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning which topped the half-billion mark globally this weekend, now at $506.8M through Sunday. The Top 5 are: China ($55.8M), UK ($31.2M), Japan ($27.3M), Korea ($21.6M) and France ($20.8M). Turning back to HTTYD, here's a rundown of the key performances: Mexico is the top offshore market with $14M (note that figures for all markets include previews unless otherwise stated). The UK flew to $11.4M with Friday's official opening day Universal's 4th No. HTTYD saw terrific uptick in China on Saturday to rep the best Fri-Sat increase of all revenue share films this year, and came in with a No. Excluding previews, it came in above Jurassic World Dominion, Mufasa, The Little Mermaid, Aladdin and Top Gun: Maverick. Rounding out the Top 5, Korea opened with $7.4M. With a 99% CVG Egg score, HTTYD's opening weekend surpassed the lifetimes of The Little Mermaid, Mufasa and Sonic 3. Excluding previews, it doubled the opening of Lilo & Stitch. Rounding out the Top 10 are France ($5.1M), Australia ($4.4M), Spain ($4.3M), Germany ($4M) and Italy ($3.3M). Also among select highlights, Thailand ($2.7M) gave HTTYD the biggest opening Friday and Saturday of 2025, with notable recognition for the local dubbing stars, and already surpassing the lifetimes of The Little Mermaid, HTTYD2, Moana 2, Wonka, Mufasa and Sonic 3. In Middle East markets, HTTYD launched with $4.1M across the region. Saudi Arabia's opening was boosted by the strong Gerard Butler fanbase and a talent tour he participated in last month. PREVIOUS, SATURDAY: Universal's How to Train Your Dragon is on track to fly in with a global debut of just over $200M, landing higher than pre-weekend projections. When factoring in domestic estimates, the opening start is looking like $200.4M worldwide through Sunday. A global bow at that level would give Hiccup and Toothless bragging rights to the 4th best worldwide opening of the year so far, behind A Minecraft Movie, Lilo & Stitch and China's Ne Zha 2. It would also be the 7th  biggest for a live-action remake (behind Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Lilo & Stitch, The Jungle Book, Alice in Wonderland and Aladdin). The Dean DeBlois-directed HTTYD is playing in 81 offshore markets and is on track to gross an estimated $117.7M this session, including previews that began last weekend. 6 offshore launch ever for a live-action remake (behind Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Lilo & Stitch, The Jungle Book and Aladdin). In terms of individual markets, Mexico kicked into gear with $2.3M on Friday to reach $4.4M including previews. The UK & Ireland through Friday is at $4.8M, including $3.3M from weekday previews. Friday grossed $1.5M across 2,000 screens, delivering Universal's 4th No. China, which did not have previews, launched across 35,000 screens on Friday with $2.3M for the day, ranking No.1 at 44% market share. While not a huge number, it was still good enough for the biggest opening day of a live-action adaptation in the past 5 years, and was in line with Inside Out 2, above Mufasa and more than double Wonka and Sonic 3.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bryan Bedford, Donald Trump‘s nominee to lead the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), has misled the public, claiming to have a “commercial” pilot license that he does not hold, Politico reported. According to Politico, Bedford does not have a commercial pilot's license listed in the FAA registry. But Bedford has claimed since at least 2010 to have that kind of license according to the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine records of Republic Airways' website. Bedford does have a private pilot's license, including credentials that he can fly multi-engine planes and fly in bad weather and at nighttime. The Department of Transportation (DOT) told Politico that Bedford has passed “written and oral exams” to fly commercial aircraft. The department additionally said that Bedford had not “personally nor publicly claimed to be a commercial airline pilot.” As Politico noted, The Air Current in an April 2025 article about Bedford also pointed out that the CEO is not a commercial pilot. Elon Musk, while leading the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, tried to lay off swaths of air traffic controllers but was stopped by the DOT. Trump blamed diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices for the crash. Bedford faced questioning last week from the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee as part of his nomination process. Members of the committee grilled him about how his company tried (and failed) to certify pilots who only met half of the federally required flight hours. When questioned by Sen. Tammy Duckworth about whether he would keep the number of required hours to 1,500, Bedford would not give a straight answer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tributes have been pouring in this past week for Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys co-founder and pop music maestro, following his death aged 82. But there have been possibly none so personal as the memories of writer David Leaf, who has recalled how he set out for Los Angeles in 1976 with the firm intention of writing a book about Wilson and his work. As well as writing his book The Beach Boys and the Californian Myth which was published in 1978, Leaf became close friends with his subject after one particular night when he realised just how sweet, but also fragile, Wilson really was. Paul McCartney Remembers "Musical Genius" Brian Wilson: "I Loved Him" Brian Wilson Dies: Beach Boys Co-Founder & Singer, Acclaimed And Troubled Genius Of Rock Generation Was 82 Leaf tells The Times of London he had encountered Wilson a handful of times during his first months in the city, and recognised him as “a deeply gentle, seemingly defeated soul, before one night cemented their friendship. “Melody Maker's West Coast correspondent Harvey Kubernik had rescued Brian as he wandered dangerously in the middle of a busy Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood. “Harvey and the radio DJ Rodney Bingenheimer then drove Brian to what they were certain was safe harbour: my apartment. The LA scenesters left, Brian came in and asked if I had anything to eat. After a quick reheating in the toaster oven, he wolfed them down. Then he went to sleep on the living room couch. Around 4am he woke up and asked for a ride home.” He also recounts a visit by Wilson to perform at HM The Queen's Golden Jubilee in 2002, when the American artist pushed past Ozzy Osbourne to greet Elizabeth II with “Hi, Queen.” Tributes have come in from across the music industry this week. Sir Paul McCartney, who always credited Wilson's God Only Knows as his favourite ever song, said: I loved him, and was privileged to be around his bright shining light for a little while.

Fresh off the success of “Materialists,” Chris Evans is letting his fellow Marvel stalwart Sebastian Stan know that he's ready to take to the stage, which Stan apparently has been telling Evans he wants to do for years. Evans, though, doubts that the “Thunderbolts*” actor is serious. “He can say that all day, but when I really call him on it — I'm like, ‘Let's do it. He's like, ‘Well, you know, I'm a little busy.' I'm like, ‘Seb, stop using me in press. Because I'm ready to get on stage with you,'” Evans told Entertainment Weekly. “But, you know, he's a busy guy. Related Stories ‘This Hellhole Underneath the Fur Is My Happy Place': How a Ventriloquist Turned Her Monkey Act Into a Directorial Debut MUBI Addresses Backlash of Investor's Support for Israeli Defense Startup But Evans is insistent that he is “dying to get on stage,” specifically with Stan, who has performed on Broadway in “Picnic” (2013) and “Talk Radio (2007). I love working with him,” Evans continued. This is not the first time Evans has heaped praise on his “Captain America” co-star. He talked to Vanity Fair earlier this year about Stan's bold career choices, which included a 2024 that saw him in such diverse films as “The Apprentice” and “A Different Man” — both of which led to critical acclaim and a bevy of awards attention. You can see that in his choices. When that Trump movie was kicking around, I remember thinking, ‘I wonder who is going to take this job? There's a lot of cooks in the kitchen. But the empirical evidence is in: They are not easy to make. If it was easier, there would be a lot more good ones,” Evans said at Emerald City Comic Con in 2024. Stan is returning to the MCU for “Avengers: Doomsday,” which is currently in production with a release date set for December 18, 2026.

Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard are “Severance” fans just like everybody else. They, however, have one advantage: Adam Scott‘s cell phone number. In Bell's Actors on Actors interview with Scott, the “Nobody Wants This” star made public exactly what she and her “Parenthood” husband leave in the text chain. “The endings to every episode of ‘Severance' are so biologically frustrating that I don't know how you guys expect anyone to sleep after an episode with that level of a cliffhanger,” Bell started. “So what Dax and I tend to do is, when we see someone whose work we love or whose work frustrates us — as in your case — we leave you a nice, long, detailed, unedited voice memo.

Nowadays, it seems almost any movie released to positive reviews gets some buzz as an “instant classic.” But a lot of classics aren't dubbed as such upon release — quite the opposite, actually. Then, there are times where the exact opposite has happened. Across film history there have been movies that have bombed at the box office, gone ignored by the Oscars, and — most dispiriting of all — gotten savaged by film critics, that have since received major reappraisals in their legacies. Oftentimes, these films are on the stranger or less conventional side, with singular aesthetics or styles that audiences can't really appreciate because they're so new — pioneering works like “The Night of the Hunter” and “Metropolis” fit into this category. Others are panned by critics who find their actual content objectionable; it's no surprise a decent amount of these films are in the horror genre, which often stirs controversy and criticism for its violence, sex, and explicit content. Whatever the reason, these 10 films got, at best, mixed reactions from professional critics in their day — but today? They've secured reputations as some of the most acclaimed movies ever. Read on for 10 great films that were panned by critics upon release. Today, Fritz Lang's “Metropolis” is regarded as one of the greatest achievements of the silent film period, and a pioneering science fiction work with themes of class warfare and human nature that would influence many works to come. But, while German expressionist work received some positive reviews, reception was mixed at best upon release. Variety wrote that “so much really artistic work was wasted on this manufactured story” in their dispatch at the time. Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times called it a “Technical marvel with feet of clay.” The most damning pan came from English science fiction writer H.G. Gene Arneel of Variety said the film was “bewitching at times,” but “loses sustained drive via too many offbeat touches that have a misty effect.” However, by the '70s — as a result of TV screenings, art house showings, and reappraisals from critics like Roger Ebert — it had been reevaluated as a masterpiece, and one of the greatest thrillers ever made. But upon its release, “Vertigo” — his 1958 film starring James Stewart as a private detective with acrophobia who becomes obsessed with the woman (Kim Novak) he's assigned to trail — wasn't one of them. The film received some positive reviews, but most were tepid at best. Arthur Penn's “Bonnie and Clyde,” a romantic account of the notorious 1930s outlaws, was very controversial at its time for its graphic violence and perceived glorification of its subjects, and the reviews of the day were appropriately divided. Roger Ebert was highly positive, giving the film one of its major raves. Dave Kaufman of Variety criticized Penn's direction as uneven, while Joe Morgenstern of Newsweek called the film a “squalid shoot-'em-up,” but later reevaluated it upon a second watch. '” Even as the film became a financial success and eventually attracted more positive criticism, Crowther remained vehemently opposed to it, and was replaced as the Times' chief critic a year later at least partially because of the controversy. Early reviews of “The Rocky Horror Picture Show,” a film version of Richard O'Brien and Jim Sharman's cult classic British musical, were largely negative. Reviewers from Variety called it “labored,” the San Francisco Chronicle said it lacked “charm and dramatic impact,” while Newsweek wrote that it was “tasteless, plotless, and pointless.” The movie also flopped upon its initial release, but slowly picked up an audience through midnight movie screenings. That audience only grew through the years, and the film is now a beloved queer cult film, one that continues to be screened year round to this day. A remake of the 1953 French film “The Wages of Fear,” William Friedkin's “Sorcerer” stars Roy Scheider, Bruno Cremer, Francisco Rabal, and Amidou as four men living in Central America who get hired to transport two trucks loaded with dynamite 200 miles to an oil well. Made under grueling conditions that escalated its budget, the film was a massive box office bomb upon release, and reviews weren't much better. Although a few critics like Roger Ebert and Vincent Canby gave the movie decent notices, many other reviewers unfavorably compared it to “The Wages of Fear” and criticized Friedkin for perceived poor craftsmanship. Many reviewers criticized the film's slow pacing, its deviations from the original Stephen King novel it was based upon, and its perceived lack of emotional impact. Janet Maslin of the New York Times said “even the film's most startling horrific images seem overbearing and perhaps even irrelevant,” while Pauline Kael wrote “Again and again, the movie leads us to expect something – almost promises it – and then disappoints us.” Both Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert were negative in their reviews of the film, with Siskel calling it a “a crashing disappointment” that “contains effectively no thrills” while Ebert wrote in his review that it was impossible to connect with the film's characters. At the first Golden Raspberry Awards, Kubrick was nominated for Worst Director. Another horror film that critics didn't know what to make of upon its release, “Possession” — Andrzej Żuławski's oblique film about the deteriorating marriage between a spy (Sam Neill) and his unraveling wife (Isabelle Adjani) — was received with lukewarm response upon its U.S. release, in part due to edits made from the original cut. Harry Haun of the New York Daily News wrote that the film was “outlandishly unhinged” and a “mess,” while Leonard Maltin called it a “confusing drama of murder, horror, intrigue.” In his review, New York Times critic Vincent Canby wrote that “New York audiences might be reduced to helpless laughter” by the film. A commercial failure upon release, John Carpenter's “The Thing” was also widely negatively received by critics, with many responding poorly to the film's cynical, anti-authoritarian themes. The visual effects were largely praised, but many critics also had a problem with their gore and excess. Premiering a year after the original TV run of “Twin Peaks” endedthe story of Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) on a massive cliffhanger, “Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me” was greeted with revulsion from both fans and critics, at least partially because it was instead a prequel about the final days of haunted prom queen Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee). Reviews upon its American release were just as negative: Vincent Canby wrote “It's not the worst movie ever made; it just seems to be” while Owen Gleiberman called it “a true folly” in which “almost nothing adds up.” Through the '90s and 2000s, as Lynch repaired his reputation through masterpieces like “Mulholland Drive” and “Twin Peaks” was evaluated as a canonical, defining TV show, more defenders of “Fire Walk With Me” have emerged, with critics praising Lee's performance as Laura Palmer and the film's unvarnished depiction of abuse.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nearly three weeks after Jamal Roberts won season 23 of “American Idol,” the R&B singer continues to be asked by media and fans about widespread speculation that judge Carrie Underwood wasn't thrilled about his rise to the top. But at the BET Awards 45th anniversary dinner on June 11, 2025, 27-year-old Roberts admitted to online journalist Nate Vinson that he knows he likely wasn't her favorite — and that he's proud of her for staying true to her “roots.” Roberts laughed, clearly unsurprised by getting another question about the supposed controversy, as Vinson continued, “People that watched the show felt like, you know, she really wasn't supportive of you like other judges, other people were of you. But, you know, I feel like the better person won.” Roberts beat out 19-year-old country crooner John Foster and 27-year-old contemporary Christian artist Breanna Nix for the top spot. Roberts' clip with Vinson drew lots of reactions on X. Some defended Underwood, others said she should have been more supportive, and a few neutral observers encouraged everyone to calm down and drop the drama. Leave her be and let people actually express their opinions without (expletive) like this. Later, after one of his top five performances, she said, “I feel like you missed such an opportunity to move around and entertain,” adding that it was time to “pull out all the stops.” On May 30, a week after Roberts' victory, “The Morning Hustle” co-host Lore'l told Roberts that some viewers thought Underwood “kind of side-eyed you” after host Ryan Seacrest announced him as the winner. Roberts diplomatically replied, “Watching all the past performances, I see that she was clapping and getting on board, so I really don't know.” Right after the finale ended, Underwood told Extra, “I do like the way it was set up, there was no way America could've gotten it wrong. “But Jamal just has a gift from God,” she continued. Every time he opens his mouth, it's flawless … I got to tell him afterwards, ‘Now, go do great things!' After she returned home to her farm near Nashville, Underwood named a baby sheep after Roberts that was born on the same day of the finale. She has since called the lamb “Baby J” in subsequent Instagram Stories.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Along with her husband and newborn son, the mother leaves behind a three-year-old daughter. Although it was confirmed by Shed Media that Miller died moments after delivering her child, the exact complications that lead to the tragedy have not been publicly revealed. A GoFundMe titled “Support for Lauren's Beloved Family,” which was created on behalf of her husband, gave a few more details on the situation, stating, “We are devastated for her beloved husband, Kevin, who must now unexpectedly take on the sole role of parenting their two children … Emma (3) and newborn Jackson, who is still in the NICU. That the day Lauren was so eagerly awaiting should end in tragedy is truly unfathomable.” An update later revealed baby Jackson was released from the NICU on Thursday, June 12. Lauren Miller is not the only notable media figure to recently die of complications from delivering a baby. In April 2024, NBC reported Instagram star and nursing influencer Hailey Okula, whose handle was @rnnewgrads, had died following the birth of her first child, a son named Crew. Okula's cause of death was an extremely rare delivery complication called “AFE,” which stands for amniotic fluid embolism. The condition occurs when them mother is allergic to her own amniotic fluid, per WebMD. A few weeks after the loss, Okula's husband wrote in a tribute on Easter 2025, “I wish you were here to create the family memories we dreamed about together.</p>

And there's part of me that's like, ‘Are they going to be ok?'" 'Stick' Review: Owen Wilson's Endearing Apple TV+ Golf Comedy Is Ideal Summer Comfort Viewing Marc Maron's 'WTF' Podcast Ending in the Fall: "We're Burnt Out" And there's part of me that's like ‘Are they going to be ok? Tony and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Tracy Letts, a friend of Maron's, led the talkback, which also included documentary director Steven Feinartz. “It's a bit much, Tracy, is what I'm saying, and I think I deserve to try to figure out how to live my life not with privacy, but without that responsibility a little bit,” Maron added. He announced the end of the show June 2, saying that he and his producing partner Brendan McDonald were “burnt out” after doing two shows every week for 16 years. In the talkback, Maron added that he had not started the podcast with the goal of making money or creating content, but rather was looking to create a connection with each guest and have “an empathic conversation with somebody about who they are.” He added that it was also his “whole fucking social life.” “It meant the world to me and really evolved my sense of self and my sense of being a person,” he said. “All of this stuff that I do has fueled whatever my particular creativity is. In the near term that will include another HBO comedy special set to release in August, and the new Apple show Stick, alongside Owen Wilson.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Additional celebrities including Anna Kendrick, Gina Rodriguez-LoCicero and Tessa Thompson were out on Saturday to protest against the Trump administration. People are protesting all across the country, including in major cities like Los Angeles and New York City, against President Donald Trump and his policies, just hours ahead of his military parade for the U.S. Army's 250th Anniversary in Washington on Saturday, which is also Trump‘s birthday. “We see a president who has made himself a king and dictator, and we don't seen an opposition that's powerful enough to stand up against the trampling of our rights and the trampling of the Constitution that's happening every single day with executive orders, with the refusal to obey court orders, kidnapping of immigrants, people who are here legally, people who their children are being taken from them,” Ruffalo added. Jimmy Kimmel, attended a protest in San Francisco with his parents. “A huge, inspiring and yes — peaceful — turnout in the South Bay. I met many people who love this country and still believe it to be a force for good. I am grateful to see so many Americans take action to stand up for our friends and neighbors, most of all, my parents,” he wrote on Instagram. “I know how fortunate I am to have been born into a family that taught me to care about others and that the most important words ever spoken are ‘Love one another.' “That's So True” singer Gracie Abrams, too, took to her Instagram Stories, sharing two photos in crowds that read, “Free speech is not an insurrection” and “If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor,” with the latter quote being from Desmond Tutu. Dan Bucatinsky and Marisa Tomei posed for a few pictures together at protests on his Instagram. In the caption, he wrote, “Coming together to show what Democracy looks like. It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia actress Mary Elizabeth Ellis captioned a carousel of video on Instagram: “Felt great to peacefully protest this administration in the streets today with fellow Los Angelenos. Kathy Griffin posted a photo on Instagram of actress Morgan Fairchild protesting, writing, “Yep, that's our gal.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>
