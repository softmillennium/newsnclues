So introducing new microbiota won't solve the problem. The theory that needs to be tested is that we know microbiota can switch SAD on, but does removal of said microbiota turn it off? I think the unknown factor here though is whether or not a persons diet is introducing the SAD causing microbiota. Introduce antibiotics to wipe out all the microbiota and does the SAD improve?There can be human trials for this given that antibiotics are approved low risk medicines. Clinical trials with antibiotics to clean out and reset the microbiome along with strict diets in attempt to prevent reintroduction of said microbiota.It can even be DIY.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Two of the most important companies behind China's semiconductor self-sufficiency and AI supremacy hopes were dealt a blow on Saturday, with their addition to Taiwan's strategic high-tech commodities entity list. This news also comes in the wake of Huawei using shell companies to deceive TSMC into manufacturing two million banned advanced AI compute chiplets for the company. Hopefully, stricter government controls will prevent any similar mistakes in the future. From now on, both Huawei and SMIC will need to obtain export permits from suppliers based in Taiwan to receive manufactured goods. According to sources like Bloomberg and Taiwan's CNA, neither the newly blacklisted Chinese companies nor Taiwan's economy ministry has shared comments on the new list. We also reported on a huge fine being levied upon TSMC for unknowingly supplying Huawei with two million compute chiplets for its Ascend 910-series AI processors. This weekend's updated entity list might have been precipitated by negotiations about such matters behind closed doors. It isn't just TSMC products that may be cut off from Huawei and SMIC; exports from established industry players, such as UMC, ASE, SPIL, Nanya, and others, will also be subject to the new restrictions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Countries that are supporting BEVs are those countries that have slip capacity to other fuels (renewable AND coal) and rare earth processing, just like those pushing for Hydrogen are those with alternative sourcing supply chains for biofuels and coal, and those pushing for continued ICE usage have plenty of access to oil. Granted, we will likely always need to do this, but where was the need at this absurd scale? Most of our heavy industry runs on diesel anyway. In terms of a use of money it is a good way to subsidize the american corn farmer. Whether you believe that is worthwhile depends on your views of WWIII. It was great for farmers though. It's always worth being sceptical about some of these claims about processes magically being carbon net negative since cleaning up the atmosphere might not actually be what's paying the bills leading to inherent conflicts between selling a product (ethanol) and doing an environmental service. Switching to EVs will allow you to use much less land to fuel the cars with wind or solar energy and then the leftover land can be used for carbon sequestration and rewilding/biodiversity projects where that's the sole focus of the operation. Never say never but for ground transport BEVs seem like they will eat the market well before anyone gets the technology working. Also, the US consumer market is 4X that of China.</p>

In fact, the same Secretary of State who deported this man from the US for his speech (amongst dozens of other such deportations[1]) has announced a policy meant to prevent other countries from doing the exact same thing. The denied person seems to be a foreign national and by all looks of it, an activist, taking part in university protests. Watching this happen twice has really killed the idea that polls are a useful way to determine mandates for government policy in my mind. Most of the population probably just shouldn't be involved. You can also vote to get people in power who are more to your liking, or even attempt be one of those people yourself. [because he was] 1> an activist 2> taking part in university protests 3> foreign You keep restating this like it means something important. In reality "evil" people almost always want to genuinely make the world a better place, and they are fighting "ignorant" people who are dragging society down by not conforming to their golden vision. And then "evil" becomes largely a function of who you ask.There are very few leaders ever who are straight up storybook style evil. Almost all of them were/are deranged people who convinced enough people of their ostensibly good vision to begin executing it.No one came to power because they wanted to turn society into burning rumble while they ate babies during daily random execution time.

The world, at the highest levels of competition and leadership, doesn't run on morals, it runs on unscrupulous force, conquest and domination. Those who tried to maintain peace on morals instead of force, got eliminated form the gene pool. Fortunately not so; some time around 50-100kya, humans rapidly became a whole lot nicer to each other. Do you really think Putin, Xi and Khomeini are better stewards of the world than the West?The West's introspective nature is good and all, but sometimes we unwittingly forget that there is actual evil in the world, and it's much worse than saying mean things on Twitter, or putting facts above feelings.Students in Iran literally die protesting the regime, meanwhile students here who live a life of luxury and don't know what actual oppression is "protest"/simp for the Iranians (or one of their various proxies)...

Can you at least give an example for your assertion?This is no more informative than saying "Trump is literally Hitler/Jesus (depending on your POV)". Things are more complex, even recent events prove The West is not a unified block where everyone thinks the same way. It reads like someone trying to spin a story to convince others of what they already wanted to believe, or maybe that kid in grade school who tells stories he read or saw, but swaps himself for the main character.Why should I believe this person more than any random internet crank? Why should I believe this person more than any random internet crank? For some reason I have been fixated on license plate readers (probably not a bad parallel to Palantir?). Plenty of people on HN justifiably decry license plate readers due to their violation of our privacy (to be sure there's an argument to made though since you are technically "in public" when driving — your privacy protections might be on shaky legal grounds).But if license plate readers are already a reality (we know they are), why should only private actors have that data? This would make sense if we completely trusted those private actors, of course.The opposite could be a public, open-source license plate reader that caught on (people using dash cams + open software) — the data sent to a collective, public database. (Perhaps the software strips out personal license plates — only logging tags of official or government vehicles? ).My first reaction is the degree to which that could be abused by ... stalkers? But then I ask myself to what degree the private license plate readers are perhaps "being abused" (or will be more and more) and we don't even know about it.As I say, a thought experiment that I find myself seeing merits both for and against.

I'm not sure if you consider governments and police to be private actors?I spoke with a sophisticated ANPR city-wide tracking vendor recently at a conference. From their video showing the system following vehicles in real-time, with detailed movement tracking, speed measurement, lane position, estimating model, age, demographic etc. when they couldn't see the registration plate, from all sorts of vantage points, it looked to me like they would know where basically everyone who drives is at all times as they moved around.So, as a privacy advocate, I asked them about tracking and knowing where every driver is all the time, and they assured me: "It's ok.  We send all this data immediatel;y to the police. "I was there interested in privacy and traffic monitoring, but there was almost nobody to speak with who seemed to think about privacy, except in a checkbox sort of way, e.g. "when you're in public there's no legal right to privacy" and "our systems are fully compliant with data protection".

I was taught many, many times growing up in the U.S. that people had a right to privacy, to free speech, to being considered innocent until proven guilty.When governmental organizations police the speech of individuals for things that are critical of the regime, we lose our right to free speech.When they download the contents of your phone when you travel, you lose the right to privacy.When people are denied a writ of habeas corpus, when they are trafficked to countries that are not from and have never been to, we are considered guilty unless we have people "on the outside" who are capable of fighting for our return.They aren't even trying to make an argument for this, outside of the cult of personality of the current regime, the belief that He can do no wrong.

Closely related to this, I have been continually frustrated with the insistence of the left wing that it borders on immoral to take a job as a soldier, police officer, prison guard, or bailiff, and that there's no reason to raise any of their pay. That leaves the various armed forces around the country staffed with individuals who feel very little opposition to rote authoritarianism, corruption, and rule-by-force. And yes, it's immoral to become a cop, just as it was immoral to become a european camp guard in the forties. There might be some mitigating factor like efficiently using it for infiltration and subversion because you didn't understand the morality of it until you were already employed, or being threatened into such a position. Do you think every police department in the US oppresses minorities and infringes on civil rights or something?>just as it was immoral to become a european camp guard in the fortiesEven for the Allies? Given the prior sentence, I can't tell whether you're trying to allude to Nazi concentration camp guards, or actually think all camp guards are immoral.

Given the prior sentence, I can't tell whether you're trying to allude to Nazi concentration camp guards, or actually think all camp guards are immoral.

This is naive to to the point of absurdity and underwrites most of the idiocy that's widely abound in anti-policing movements. In one breath they claim that "police" are as a class immoral, and in the next they proclaim that their political opponents must be "brought to justice" by armed people following a set of written laws.

A YouTube creator has been able to get their hands on an early Steam Deck prototype (engineering sample 34) and disassembled it on camera to show off its clean internal layout. X (formerly Twitter) user SadlyItsDadley lent the unit to Jon Bringus of Bringus Studios, saying, “…he was easily the best person to archive this piece of gaming history.” Once it was in his hands, Bringus set about stripping the cover off the Steam Deck evaluation unit on his YouTube channel. Interestingly, the device came with a piece of paper marked as “POC2-34 Control 163”, signifying that the console he had in his hands was indeed proof-of-concept number 34. Aside from exploring it physically, Jon also tried running some games on the handheld, showing us how far Valve has come since it first started toying with the idea of a portable Steam gaming console. The external look of this evaluation unit is a bit different from the Steam Deck that we know and love today. For one, its touchpads are huge circles, a far cry from the cleaner rectangular units found on the current console. Its dual joysticks are also much smaller than what we're used to, and the contoured palm rests are a bit different on the experimental unit. Its BIOS indicated that this model was packing an AMD Ryzen 7 3700U and 8GB of RAM. It also came with a 256GB SSD and an Intel Wi-Fi chip, plus the system said that it had discrete GPU support (although Bringus wasn't able to test this capability). He inserted the imaged drive, and to his surprise, it contained an early version of SteamOS with three pre-installed accounts. Valve launched a renaissance in handheld gaming consoles with the Steam Deck. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It isn't just that this is his first time on the big screen, it's also the matter of who's playing him: Edi Gathegi, who many likely remember as Darwin from X-Men: First Class, aka the mutant who died despite having the power to evolve and adapt to anything. Sooner or later, conversations about First Class remind you how dumb his death was, and Gathegi seems to agree. Talking to Entertainment Weekly, he noted the character's death “is just a case of bad representation and missed opportunity.” The actor explained that he wasn't put off by dying given Darwin's power (and superheroes dying on a regular basis), and hoped to return in later movies. But with each passing sequel, those chances became less likely, hence him calling it “misrepresentation and missed opportunity.” In Gathegi's eyes, getting to suit up again in Superman as Terrific is a way of “undoing the wrongs of Darwin,” and a role he's excited to inhabit.He's previously described the hero as “an atheist who believes in justice,” which is informed by Holt losing his wife in a car crash. Following her death, Holt “found meaning in knowledge and saw that while the universe might be cruel, intelligence, science, and innovation could make it better. Terrific is expected to appear in future DC projects. Gathegi's not saying which, but we already can't wait to see him again.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Board partners are now rolling out freshly baked BIOS updates based on AMD's AGESA 1.2.0.3e firmware. The updates are designed to patch a security flaw that could allow hackers to read sensitive data stored within the TPM (Trusted Platform Module), via VideoCardz. At least for some manufacturers, this BIOS update is a one-way street; you cannot roll back to an older release once you install it. Hackers can exploit this security flaw by triggering an out-of-bounds read beyond the TPM2.0 routine. By doing so, these unauthorized users can gain access to sensitive data or disrupt the TPM's functionality as a whole. This stems from a bug (CVE-2025-2884), ranked 6.6 (Medium) on the CVSS scale, in TPM2.0's Module Library, which refers to standardized code that TPM 2.0 chips use for various functions. What makes this particular bug concerning is its accessibility, since it can be exploited using standard user-mode privileges, meaning an attacker doesn't need kernel-level access. This is a significant difference from previous vulnerabilities, including one that could execute unsigned microcode but required kernel-level access. That being said, patches for most of these processors have been deployed across different timelines in the past few months. Several motherboard partners, including Asus and MSI, have started to roll out BIOS updates based on the new AGESA 1.2.0.3e firmware. In addition to fixing the aforementioned TPM flaw, this firmware also adds support for a new and upcoming Ryzen CPU, likely alluding to Ryzen 9000F series processors.

Microsoft Senior Program Manager on the Windows Insider Program Team, Brandon LeBlanc, admitted it was “an actual bug” after a bit of joking around. The latest Windows 11 Insider Preview Build is 26200.5651 (Dev Channel) and the timing of its release coincides with Xeno's initial Tweet. This OS preview was heralded as bringing features such as new Copilot+ PC experiences, a new Recall export function, a bigger clock/calendar in the notification center, and more. At one point LeBlanc joked that the ‘issue' was precipitated after he “went in and had some fun with the sound files in Windows and thought folks needed a blast from the past.” It was then suggested the Windows 95 startup sound would be a good choice for the impending 30th anniversary of its launch (August 24). With his official responsibility as a Microsoft exec in mind, LeBlanc must have felt it necessary to then make clear he was joking, and the startup sound mix-up was “an actual bug.” reviving the glassy Windows Aero aesthetic with its latest macOS 26 Tahoe release.

Typically, as a professional mattress tester of over five years, I'd tell you it differs from person to person. But there are always the rare few models that manage to pull off the near impossible for a mattress to accomplish: being a supportive and comfortable fit for anybody, regardless of build or sleeping position. The Nolah Evolution Hybrid is one of those mattresses, and one of the rare few near-perfect beds I've tested to date. A commonality among Nolah mattresses is the use of something called AirFoam, which Nolah created to improve on memory foam performance factors: pressure relief, support, and durability. AirFoam is also meant to sleep cooler, since sucking in body heat is a known problem with memory foam. But what I can tell you is that the model I regularly use, the luxury firm, does a swell job with pressure relief and lumbar support. It's definitely a taller mattress, and I use a frame lower to the ground to accommodate that (and my dogs' smaller legs). The standard pillow top's organic cotton cover (which I have the most experience with) is breathable, but it isn't going to give you that refrigerator-opening-blast-in-the-face coolness. So, side sleepers, pay attention to what I'm saying here. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. A “Heat Escape Gusset” encircles the pillow top, which is essentially just mesh that is supposed to let heat escape from within the pillow top. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. These holes allow the hips and shoulders to get a generally softer feel, while a firmer one is upheld right under where your spine curves. A 2-inch layer of comfort foam follows for—you guessed it—more pressure relief, along with a transition layer protecting the foam from the coil core. The coils are pocketed, allowing each one to react to your body instead of making it a group project like traditional innerspring beds of old. They're also reinforced in the center and along the edges, which is just an extra-firm feel to keep these particular areas extra-supported. Lastly, everything is set up on a foam base, which lets the coils really do their thing without being compressed by contact with your bed frame. Here's what I like from testing this mattress. I remember when Nolah first launched the Evolution back in 2020, and it was touted as a good option for side sleepers with all the pressure relief and lumbar support features. Something that has always stood out to me as a major value add was the three firmness options available: plush, luxury firm, and firm. Having a variety of firmnesses is an easy way to make a mattress more accessible to all kinds of sleepers, especially with different body types and sleeping positions. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. I landed on “luxury firm” for a couple of reasons, chief among them being that I'm part of a dynamic sleeping duo. All to say, these sleeping positions can require different firmness levels for adequate support, preferences not even being factored in. Luxury firm is the middle ground, and we've found it to be a welcoming amount of softness that doesn't cancel out the feeling of support. Everything remains relatively on the same level—hips, lower back, and shoulders—which is what you want for even spine alignment. When on your back, your spine curves away from the bed, but the pillow top takes up that space nicely. That way your back doesn't feel like it's being left out support-wise, and this eliminates a potential cause of back pain. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. I do pick up on some rocking if my husband moves around in his sleep, which isn't ideal, but it's not the most disruptive I've ever tested. I'm often relegated to the very edge of the mattress while my dogs stretch out (a mother's sacrifice, I tell you). The reinforced coils are fine for supporting you while lying down, and your weight is evenly distributed across them. Sitting is a whole other ball game, especially if you're like me and sit at the foot to put on your socks. Granted, I've only ever tested versions with the organic cotton cover, as the new and improved Glacio-Tex cover is a new development. This is fine for my needs, but I make sure to use cooling sheets and keep the fan running. If you're a hot sleeper by nature, or have medical conditions like POTS or menopause and really need that cool-feeling mattress, you may need to go all in on the upgraded pillow top. They're located on the sides and have been very handy (pun intended) for when I rotate my mattress every few months. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. It's going so far as to get the mattress for themselves. And if you haven't picked up on it by now, I have the Nolah Evolution hybrid at home.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The saying goes that a dog is a man's best friend, but an archaeological excavation in Norway proves that women care about their four-legged companions just as much as men do, even 1,100 years ago. Archaeologists from the Arctic University Museum of Norway have revealed a 10th-century Viking boat grave on the Norwegian island of Senja. The buried individual is likely a woman who belonged to an elite class, as Science Norway first reported. Most notably, the team found a dog carefully buried at her feet. “It appears to have been placed with real care,” Anja Roth Niemi, a museum archaeologist who presumably took part in the excavation, told Science Norway. So even back then, people had deep bonds with their animals.” A metal detectorist first discovered brooches and bone remains at the site just 7.9 inches (20 centimeters) beneath the ground two years ago. “After the upper layer of soil was removed, it became clear that this was a boat grave,” the museum wrote in a social media post. This is not the first time archaeologists have found dog remains alongside Viking ones, but it provides further proof that dogs were prized companions even 1,100 years ago. They also indicate that the buried individual was a woman, given that oval brooches were usually Viking women's jewelry, though only bone analysis can confirm this beyond a doubt. “Only the elite would receive a burial like this,” Niemi told Science Norway. Niemi and her colleagues also uncovered agricultural tools and textile instruments, the latter of which further associate the burial with Viking womanhood. Further analyses will confirm the individual's sex and shed light on her age, height, diet, and health, while also offering more insight into Viking burial traditions. It is my hope that they keep the woman and her pet together in Tromsø, so that the dog can continue guarding its owner in the afterlife as it likely did when they were both alive.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When legendary game designer Hideo Kojima announced to the world that Death Stranding 2 would soon be released, he made it known that Covid-19 had completely changed his idea for this sequel. “After the release, just three months later, a pandemic broke out, and I was very surprised. It really felt like Death Stranding, in a way.” WIRED headed to Tokyo in April for a long and comprehensive preview of the game and asked Kojima about all the secrets behind Death Stranding 2's creation. It was different than, for example, the Spanish flu pandemic a century earlier. Now there are people who work for our studio from home and whose faces I don't even know. Live concerts were canceled, and everything moved to online streaming. I understand that it was inevitable during the pandemic. Instead of playing with friends or learning from teachers, you watched a screen, as if you were watching a YouTube video. You'd turn on the TV and everyone was talking about how we were now in the metaverse era, where there was no need to physically interact with people. I thought we were going in the wrong direction. Communication between human beings shouldn't be like that. You meet people by chance and see unexpected things. With the path we were on, all of that would be lost.” As Kojima explains, the initial concept for Death Stranding 2 was very different, and even his idea of connections between people changed after the pandemic: “I already had an idea for Death Stranding 2 before the pandemic,” he says, “but after going through that experience I felt something wasn't right, and I rewrote it.” “The strangest thing was that after creating a game with the theme ‘let's connect instead of isolating,' the pandemic came along, and I started thinking, ‘Maybe connecting so much is not such a good thing.' So we went back to the stick-and-rope theory [from Death Stranding] again. There is a lot of anticipation of that theme in the game, and I'm sure many people will understand what I meant by coming to the end of the experience. Even within the game, you will see threads that start from many people and go upward, like Dollman and the robotic soldiers. Play the game when it comes out in June to learn more!” I'm not saying the metaverse is evil, but you have come all this way and played the game for four days. Today, something like that would normally only happen online.” That's why we invited you to come here physically, despite your busy schedules. People from all over the world have gathered here in our studios, meeting each other and starting conversations. These things are part of the human experience. These coincidences and unintended events tie together naturally, but none of this exists in the metaverse.” The player can choose to fight much more often than in the first part, although it's not required. If the first chapter often tried to avoid firefights, almost punishing those who killed enemies, something has also changed in terms of this when it comes to the sequel, Kojima says. Today, even though the world is connected via a rope, which we know as the online world, people still play games where they use the ‘stick,' shooting each other. That's why I wanted to create a game where you use a rope above all else, and that was Death Stranding. “There are so many conflicts in the world today. That's one of the reasons I said ‘we shouldn't have connected,' and it's not just about the game aspect, it's also a reflection on a social level.” Among the many important themes in the game are those related to loss and mourning, and Kojima reveals that the inspiration to include them also partly stems from personal experiences: “It comes from within, so I'd say it's half based on real experiences I've had and half from fiction. It comes from a very intimate place, from thoughts like a sense of loneliness, the mystery of where the dead go, and the pain of not having had a true goodbye with someone we have lost.” “I hope you remember the first Metal Gear Solid, where you really had to concentrate on infiltration, otherwise it was ‘game over.' The reason I had done this was that if I had put a weapon there from the beginning, players would have used it to eliminate enemies. It would no longer have been a ‘stealth' game. That's why I deliberately removed it, but many hated that choice and many couldn't even get to the lift. “In the first Metal Gear Solid we included a lot of mechanics to teach what stealth was. So for MGS 2, I knew that people now understood the concept better, and so I made the weapons more accessible. You could even target specific body parts of enemies.” At the beginning it was a game focused on deliveries, something no one had ever seen before, so some people might feel frustrated by that. “But now the public is familiar with the idea, so I wanted to give players more freedom, even those who want to fight, for example. Everything is more accessible in this second installment. It's still a delivery game, but I wanted to offer more freedom in terms of game mechanics—that was the goal.” This freedom is also reflected in the combat. Indeed, the game is now much more focused on firefights, but the main thing was, above all else, the ability to give players a choice in how they approach the various missions—something that doesn't force them to fight at all costs: “Well, I don't want to suggest to people that they focus on combat or anything like that, but there are a lot of players all over the world asking me to make another Metal Gear, so here too I added more options for combat.” “This, however, is still a game focused primarily on deliveries. You can avoid enemies by taking a longer ride around the map or by quickly passing a vehicle or motorbike through an encampment, or you can fight them. When we were working on these mechanics, I was a little worried, because many of the team members who worked with me on Metal Gear still work with me, and we kept asking ourselves, ‘Does this feel too Metal Gear?' This freer approach was also shared by his colleagues: Yoji Shinkawa, art director of character and mechanical design, who has worked with Kojima since Metal Gear Solid; Hirohaki Yoshiike, lead level designer; Takayuki Uchida, technical art director, lead environment artist; and, finally, Akio Sakamoto, chief technology officer, technical director. Whether in exploration, combat, or stealth, the development team's approach has always been to provide the player with the tools to act as he or she prefers, which is why over the years they have focused heavily on improving gunfights and stealth, incorporating new weapons, new mechanics and the ability to adapt Sam's character to each user's play style. America already had the [United Cities of America], so for the sequel I wondered whether or not to use a similar setting. The choice to use Australia as Plate Gate in the second chapter was because of its geographical features: a place that was not too large and which ran from east to west along an ocean was needed. I obviously have no plans to do that, but I do have an idea in mind for one possible one. This choice, however, has led to some minor problems in the direction of the cutscenes, which are also managed in real time according to the time of day. He mentions how important it is for him to analyze player behavior in his games, particularly with regard to the asynchronous multiplayer of the first Death Stranding, which allows players to share objects and constructions, such as bridges and ladders, with other users. He says he's not much of a construction guy, preferring to use simpler tools like ladders when playing. For players who are fans of this mechanic, however, he has added many elements in Death Stranding 2, such as the monorail, which is a new addition. He went on to explain the meaning of likes, which work very much like social media likes in the game: “A like is not a currency—you don't get any items or become stronger because of them. The team was very hesitant about adding them at first. They are closer to likes in the real world. From a game design point of view, it's strange. Normally you accumulate points and get a rank or rewards, but in our case the like is just a personal incentive. Even the team, who were initially opposed, changed their minds.” Kojima has said the criteria he uses to choose them is always based on the connections he has with people and their work. Kojima says he usually contacts these stars personally and, on many occasions, including with Luca Marinelli, who plays Neil in the game, the actor or their agent turns out to be a fan of the game designer. This also applies to Od, Physint, and other projects.” He asked the distributor for my contact details, and we got to know each other.” “When I thought about involving him, I knew that his character had to surpass the one played by Mads Mikkelsen. Mads' character could not return in Death Stranding 2, and I knew some fans would be disappointed. I had to find someone who could go further. Before shooting we have to scan the actor, decide on a hairstyle, makeup, and costumes and then create the digital data. “Unlike a film, however, we can't shoot everything in three or four months, and we meet periodically during the development. It's not a matter of three months and we're done. After that there is also the ADR [automatic dialog replacement, or dubbing], for example. When the character appears as an NPC, you also have to record sounds, moans, breaths, grunts … and that part never seems to end. Death Stranding 2 also features Marinelli's wife, Alissa Jung: “I was also looking for someone to play Lucy, but in the midst of the pandemic it wasn't easy. One day, Luca asked me if I had found his ‘counterpart.' He told me that his wife is an actor and also a director, so we met and I found her really brilliant, intelligent, perfect for the role of Lucy. Among Kojima's favorite scenes filmed for Death Stranding 2, he mentions one shot by Marinelli and Jung: “Luca, meanwhile, was filming the series Mussolini: Son of the Century, directed by Joe Wright. He replied: ‘I'm getting fat to play Mussolini.' “A year later, at the time of motion capture, he had changed again. It was quite a problem, but what he shot is really good! Most of the scenes with Alissa and Luca are just between the two of them, and the interesting thing is that, because they are husband and wife in real life, they have an incredible chemistry. Sometimes she tried to take over on the set too! We shot at the SIE studio in Los Angeles. Me and a couple of my staff went to manage the shoot, but there were many other people including technicians, makeup artists, and others. When Luca started acting, however, everyone came over to watch. Kojima's games also impress with their beautiful soundtracks, and Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is no exception. One of the star artists of the new title is Woodkid, and the game director recounted that he met him by chance in Paris in 2020, when the artist wanted to introduce himself, being a fan of Kojima's, by playing one of his songs. Kojima was also struck by Woodkid's music videos, which have atmospheres like that of Death Stranding, and Kojima decided to contact him to have him work on some songs for the soundtrack of the second chapter. Kojima explained that he had also included some unreleased Low Roar tracks in the new game, sent to him by the singer's family. Kojima follows the same approach for the music in his games as he does for the choice of actors: “Just like for the casting of actors, I contact them directly: Sometimes I ask if I can use one of their songs, other times they offer to write a new one, and an exchange takes place.” “Yoji [Shinkawa] would come by maybe once a week, but otherwise I worked without seeing anyone in person. Yet, despite all the challenges, we're almost done now. “During the pandemic I thought we would never make it. We couldn't shoot anything, everything was at a standstill, and I wondered: ‘How can I make a game like this?' At that time I couldn't go to Los Angeles to direct; the studio wouldn't allow it. It was like that for all the studios. I was working from Tokyo and connected online with Los Angeles. We used iPads and smartphones, but it didn't work very well. “Then an acquaintance of mine at Sony created something called Mado, which means window in Japanese. You see and hear everything in real time. Unfortunately you can't walk through to the other side but they lent us two of these devices and we managed to get the footage we needed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For those who were pregnant at the time, enduring these extreme conditions wasn't just uncomfortable—it may have left a lasting imprint on their children's brains. That's according to a new study published on Wednesday in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS One. Using MRI scans, researchers at Queens College, City University of New York, found that children whose mothers lived through Superstorm Sandy had distinct brain differences that could hinder their emotional development. “It's not just one climate stressor or one isolated event, but rather a combination of everything,” said Donato DeIngeniis, the lead author of the study and a doctoral student in neuropsychology at the CUNY Graduate Center. A few years ago, scientists dubbed summer “danger season” since it's a time of colliding risks, including heat, hurricanes, wildfires, and toxic smoke. The study analyzed brain imaging data from a group of 34 children, approximately 8 years old, whose mothers were pregnant during Superstorm Sandy—some of whom were pregnant at the time that Sandy made landfall, and some of whom were exposed to heat 95 degrees F or higher during their pregnancy. While the researchers didn't find that heat alone had much of an impact, living through Superstorm Sandy led to an increase in the basal ganglia's volume, a part of the brain that deals with regulating emotions. While that larger size could be a compensation in response to stress, changes in the basal ganglia have been linked to behavioral challenges for children, such as depression and autism, DeIngeniis said. “What we are seeing is compelling evidence that the climate crisis is not just an environmental emergency, it is potentially a neurological one with consequence for future generations who will inherit our planet,” said Duke Shereen, a co-author of the study and the director of the MRI facility at CUNY Graduate Center, in a press release. Global warming made Superstorm Sandy more damaging as a result of rising sea levels and higher ocean temperatures that might have amped up its rainfall. Any added stress at that time, even if small, “can have a much bigger impact,” Nomura said. But that extra-sensitive period also presents a window of opportunity. “Developmental science, including the science in this paper, is exciting because it not only tells us what we can do to protect children from the effects of climate change, but it also tells us when we can step in to protect children to make the greatest difference,” Lindsey Burghardt, chief science officer at the Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University, said in an email. Although there's a lot of evidence that prenatal stress generally can affect child brain development, according to DeIngeniis, research on climate-related stress specifically is lacking. “It is still a field that has potential for explosive growth,” said Jennifer Barkin, a professor at Mercer University School of Medicine in Macon, Georgia, who is studying the effects of last year's Hurricane Helene on maternal health. DeIngeniis' study offers concrete evidence of how climate-charged events can affect the brain, Barkin said. “People have a hard time sometimes with mental health, because it's not like you can take an X-ray and see a broken bone.” But it's easier to understand imaging showing a difference in brain volume based on exposure to environmental stress, she said. Barkin, who developed an index for measuring maternal health after childbirth, says that people are beginning to pay more attention to mothers and their mental health—not just in terms of delivering a healthy baby, but over the long term. “Because when Mom's struggling, the family's going to struggle.” Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. This study offers new hope for drug-free pain treatments, but further trials will need to verify its results. Neuralink competitor Paradromics plans to conduct the first clinical trial of its Connexus brain implant later this year. Microplastics could play a hidden role in the relationship between ultra-processed foods and certain neurological disorders, according to new research.
