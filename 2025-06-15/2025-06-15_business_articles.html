                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sen. Amy Klobuchar remembered fellow Minnesota Democrat Mellissa Hortman, who was fatally shot in her home early Saturday morning alongside her husband, Mark, as a "true public servant." "I just wish everyone in the world, the political world, knew this woman like we know her in Minnesota, loved by Democrats and Republicans," Klobuchar said of Hortman, who was a member of the Minnesota House since 2005. "We started out together in politics, moms with young kids, and somehow she was able to balance getting to know everyone, door knock every house in her district, while raising two children," she continued on NBC's "Meet the Press." A massive manhunt continues Sunday for the suspect, who officials have identified as 57-year-old Vance Luther Boelter. The suspect also shot State Senator John A. Hoffman, a fellow Democrat, and his wife, Yvette, in a separate attack at their home early Saturday morning. Klobuchar said Sunday that the couple was "hanging in there." She said that Hoffman may need "additional surgeries," but he is currently in stable condition. Klobuchar said that authorities believe the suspect could still be in the Midwest, and that they've put out an alert in South Dakota. "We believe he's somewhere in the vicinity and that they are going to find him," Klobuchar said. "My concern is that this guy is going to come up against just an innocent, try to take their car, try to go into their house right now," Klobuchar said. "A lot of the political leaders in our state have received extra protection, but not the innocents out there," she added. Authorities discovered a "manifesto" in the suspect's car that included several names of officials and lawmakers. Klobuchar said that she has received additional security without her request.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The S&P 500 is less than 3% from an all-time high. But even as the U.S. stock market index proves its resilience during a volatile stretch for investors, more money from within portfolios is expected to shift in to privately traded companies. Jan Van Eck, CEO of ETF and mutual fund manager VanEck, says the trend of companies staying private for longer rather than seeking an initial public offering is here to stay and it offers new opportunities. High-profile examples include Elon Musk's SpaceX, Sam Altman's OpenAI and fintech Stripe. Some ETFs have begun to invest small portions of their assets in privately held company shares, including SpaceX, such as the ERShares Private-Public Crossover ETF (XOVR). VanEck has launched an ETF tackling the private opportunity in a different way: taking big positions in the publicly traded shares of the investment giants, including private equity firms and other alternative asset managers, that own many private companies. The VanEck Alternative Asset Manager ETF (GPZ), which launched this month, has a portfolio holdings list that includes Brookfield, Blackstone, KKR, Brookfield Asset Management and Apollo, which combined make up almost 50% of the fund. TPG, Ares and Carlyle are also big positions, in the 5% range each. The new ETF extends an existing focus on private markets for VanEck. For over a decade, it has offered investors access to private credit, through the VanEck BDC Income ETF (BIZD), which invests in the business development companies that lend to small- and mid-sized private companies. That ETF has a high level of exposure to Ares, Blue Owl, Blackstone, Main Street and Golub Capital, which make up about half of the fund. "You have to believe this is a secular trend and growth will be higher than that for normal money managers, including ETF and mutual fund managers," said Van Eck. He cautions, however, there is more volatility in these funds compared to the public equity market overall. "You have to size it appropriately," he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trade negotiations and heightened geopolitical conflict are weighing on market sentiment, but investors seeking stable income can solidify their portfolios through the addition of dividend stocks. Tracking the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts could inform investors as they hunt for attractive dividend stocks, given that the investment thesis of these experts is backed by an in-depth analysis of a company's fundamentals. Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. Telecom giant Verizon Communications (VZ) is this week's first dividend pick. The company recently declared a quarterly dividend of $0.6775 per share, payable on Aug. 1. Following a meeting with Verizon management, Citi analyst Michael Rollins noted that the company is upbeat about bolstering its leadership in broadband and converged services over the next few years. The company aims to double its converged wireless subscriptions (customers having both wireless and broadband subscriptions) from the current level of 16% to 17% of its customer base over the next three years. Given the ongoing promotional backdrop in the wireless space, Rollins noted that competitive data points are still mixed. Nonetheless, Verizon is highly focused on customer retention and improving churn to rebound to its BAU (business as usual) levels in the second half of this year, partly supported by its new upgrade program. Rollins noted that Verizon is optimistic about improvement in its performance in the second half of the year and continues to expect to add more postpaid phone subscriptions in 2025 compared to the previous year. Overall, Rollins is bullish on VZ's long-term growth potential, noting the "under-appreciated value for its financial prospects." 249 among more than 9,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. See Verizon Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks. Let's move to the next dividend stock: Restaurant Brands International (QSR). This is a quick-service restaurant chain that owns iconic brands like Tim Hortons and Burger King. QSR offers a quarterly dividend of 62 cents per share. In May, Restaurant Brands said that it still expects to achieve its long-term algorithm, which projects 8% organic adjusted operating income growth on average between 2024 and 2028. Evercore analyst David Palmer said that the company can deliver on-algorithm 8% profit growth in both 2025 and 2026, despite his estimates indicating below-algorithm systemwide sales growth of 5% and 6% in 2025 and 2026, respectively. He explained that despite lower sales, the company could achieve its profitability target in 2025 due to its cost management and lower stock-based compensation. Palmer added that with QSR stock trading at significant discount to Yum Brands and McDonald's, he sees the company's earnings delivery as "step one to upside." He also highlighted other catalysts for QSR stock, including ongoing above-consensus International same-store sales growth, positive same-store sales growth for Burger King U.S. and Tim Hortons Canada, and a resale of the China business, which is expected to drive improved income in 2026. Overall, Palmer is bullish on QSR stock and reiterated a buy rating with a price target of $86, which reflects a P/E (price-to-earnings) multiple of 23x and 22x based on 2025 and 2026 earnings estimates, respectively. The analyst contends that QSR commands a valuation multiple closer to rivals that are currently trading at 24x or higher. 632 among more than 9,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. See Restaurant Brands International Technical Analysis on TipRanks. The company recently announced a deal to acquire Encino Acquisition Partners for $5.6 billion. The company highlighted that this deal's accretion to its free cash flow supports its commitment to shareholder returns. Notably, EOG announced a 5% increase in its dividend to $1.02 per share, payable on Oct. 31. Reacting to the Encino acquisition, RBC Capital analyst Scott Hanold said, "Encino's assets makes sense from a strategic and value adding perspective, in our view." Hanold highlighted that the deal increases EOG's Utica position to a combined acreage of 1.1 million acres, producing 275 Mboe/d (million barrels of oil equivalent per day). The analyst expects the combined acreage in Utica to surpass 300 Mboe/d by early 2026, which is second only to EOG's Permian position. Hanold expects scaled development to begin in 2026. Hanold pointed out management's commentary about shareholder returns remaining similar to those of recent quarters at 100% of free cash flow, with buybacks continuing to be a priority. He also noted the 5% rise in EOG's fixed dividend. 15 among more than 9,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. See EOG Resources Stock Buybacks on TipRanks.

As Mark Carney prepares to host world leaders at the Group of Seven summit in western Canada, he's showing off a foreign policy that's more hardheaded than that of Justin Trudeau.

Trudeau put climate change and progressive social values front and center, an approach that often led to clashes with other leaders. Carney has emphasized economic ties, hard power and alliances that would allow Canada to reduce its economic and security dependence on the US.</p>

Apple's unveiling of iOS 26 and the Liquid Glass interface was the most discussed part of its developers conference, but the real gems were its enhancements to CarPlay, the Vision Pro and the iPad. Also: Delayed Siri upgrades are now targeted for next spring; Apple's AI chief lies low at WWDC; and the company gets cozier with OpenAI.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Senate Republicans' proposal to overhaul student loan repayment could trigger a surge in defaults, one expert said. The proposals do so by "making student debt much harder to repay" and "unleashing an avalanche of student loan defaults," he wrote. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions introduced bill text on June 10 that would change how millions of new borrowers pay down their debt. More from Personal Finance:Experts weigh pros and cons of $1,000 Trump baby bonusHow Trump spending bill may curb low-income tax creditWhy millions would lose health insurance under House spending bill With control of Congress, Republicans can pass their legislation using "budget reconciliation," which needs only a simple majority in the Senate. Gadkaree and other consumer advocates have expressed concerns about how the new terms would imperil many borrowers' ability to meet their monthly bills — and to ever get out of their debt. More than 42 million Americans hold student loans, and collectively, outstanding federal education debt exceeds $1.6 trillion. More than 5 million borrowers were in default as of late April, and that total could swell to roughly 10 million borrowers within a few months, according to the Trump administration. Currently, borrowers have about a dozen plan options to repay their student debt, according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. But under the Senate Republican proposal, there would be just two repayment plan choices for those who borrow federal student loans after July 1, 2026. (Current borrowers should maintain access to other existing repayment plans.) As of now, borrowers who enroll in the standard repayment plan typically get their debt divided into 120 fixed payments, over 10 years. But the Republicans' new standard plan would provide borrowers fixed payments over a period between 10 years and 25 years, depending on how much they owe. Borrowers would also have an option of enrolling in an income-based repayment plan, known as the "Repayment Assistance Plan," or RAP. Monthly bills for borrowers on RAP would be set as a share of their income. Payments would typically range from 1% to 10% of a borrower's income; the more they earn, the bigger their required payment. Still, Kantrowitz said: "Many low-income borrowers will be in repayment under RAP for the full 30-year duration." A typical student loan borrower with a college degree could pay an extra $2,929 per year if the Senate GOP proposal of RAP is enacted, compared to the Biden administration's now blocked SAVE plan, according to a recent analysis by the Student Borrower Protection Center. "As the Committee considers this legislation, it is clear that a vote for this bill is a vote to saddle millions of borrowers across the country with more student loan debt, at the same moment that a slowing economy, a reckless trade war, and spiraling costs of living squeeze working families from every direction," Mike Pierce, the executive director of the Center, wrote in the letter. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, said the proposal would stop requiring that taxpayers who didn't go to college foot the loan payments for those with degrees. Cassidy said his party's legislation would save taxpayers at least $300 billion. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When job-hopping, make sure not to accidentally bring your old company's culture along for the ride, said Bob Baxley, a former director of design at Apple. "I think my own particular mistake, and I've seen this with some other Apple executives as well, is we went directly from Apple — I left Apple on a Friday and I started Pinterest on a Monday," Baxley said on a recent episode of Lenny's Podcast. "That's not really where Pinterest was at the time." It's not just Apple's working environment that has a way of sticking with you, Baxley added — most major tech companies have "really powerful cultures." "You get kind of indoctrinated into all those standards and it's really deep. It infuses all of your behavior and how you conduct yourself in the company, away from the company," he said. Baxley said that other former Apple employees have smoother transitions, purely by virtue of taking time off before taking up a new position. Baxley cites Hiroki Asai as a prime example — as Apple's former Vice President of Global Marketing, Asai took years off for "re-wirement" prior to joining AirBnB, according to his LinkedIn. "At Apple, I think it was Tim or Steve, used to talk about the Apple car wash," he added. It turns out there's a car wash you need to go through when you leave Apple as well." As you move on, it's worth asking how you can best incorporate the best aspects of your old company's culture in your new workplace, Baxley added. "And so I think it's important to recalibrate and say, well, I want to hold onto these values," he said. "So at Apple, attention to detail, product excellence, doing everything you can for the customer and the user — so, try to hold onto those values but then think, 'Okay, how are those values best expressed in this culture?'" Still, Baxley told Business Insider, it won't always be possible to pause between roles — particularly in the tech sphere, where companies usually want new hires to onboard right away. Even if you have to start immediately, it could be helpful to go in while expecting a period of adjustment. "My biggest point on this topic is that when you go into a new culture you really need to slow down, deeply observe, don't judge or compare, and then when you have a reasonable handle on things, reflect on the best ways to express the values from the old place with behaviors that are appropriate to the new," he told BI.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tracy Davis, 42, still thinks that voting for President Donald Trump was a good choice. But she wishes the president would think more carefully about how his actions are affecting student-loan borrowers like herself. "I did vote for Trump," Davis told Business Insider. "This was a very big surprise for me. Davis is referring to the Trump administration's move to restart collections on defaulted student loans in early May after a five-year pause. Negative credit reporting for defaulted student loans resumed in October 2024, and Trump's Education Department announced that collections would resume in an effort to restore accountability to the student-loan system. "Borrowing money and failing to pay it back isn't a victimless offense," Linda McMahon, Trump's education secretary, wrote in an opinion piece. "Debt doesn't go away; it gets transferred to others. It caused her to fall behind on payments, and her credit score took a hit after negative credit reporting resumed. "I just wish there was more thought put into it." Business Insider has heard from dozens of student-loan borrowers who are delinquent or in default on their debt, including some who voted for Trump. Borrowers tend to go into default after 270 days of missed payments. Ellen Keast, a spokesperson for the Department of Education, previously confirmed to BI that Social Security garnishment for defaulted borrowers is paused: "The Trump Administration is committed to protecting social security recipients who oftentimes rely on a fixed income." However, the department still plans to garnish wages for defaulted borrowers later this summer. "If you were way behind and you had no intention of paying them back, yes, go after them, garnish wages," Davis said. "But when you're trying to make it and you're trying to honestly make an effort to pay them off, I don't think that's right that we're getting wages garnished or credit hits." "I'm having a bit of buyer's remorse," Metheny said. "We already don't make enough to really even survive at this point," Metheny said. I worry about people that are already hurting." The Department of Education estimated that 5 million borrowers are currently in default. Recent data from the New York Federal Reserve showed that millions more could enter default this summer; since negative credit reporting resumed in the fall, 8.04% of balances moved into serious delinquency in the first quarter of 2025. While some higher education analysts previously told BI that the surge in delinquency was expected, many borrowers are at risk of defaulting because they might not be aware of their payment status and are unprepared to afford an extra monthly bill. Some student-loan borrowers at risk of default said they still support Trump's move to collect on defaulted student loans. "I'm not going to bash the Trump administration. But that being said, I think that turning people over to collections is a very drastic move after what we just went through over the past four years," Cheri said. Aside from collections on defaulted student loans, the Trump administration is urging Congress to pass the president's big spending bill. McMahon wrote in a June 11 post on X that the bill "will prevent future Democrat administrations from illegally transferring student loan debt to American taxpayers." Former President Joe Biden's SAVE plan — an income-driven repayment plan that would have allowed for cheaper monthly payments — is also blocked in court, leaving borrowers with fewer repayment options. As far as default consequences go, Sen. Elizabeth Warren said that McMahon confirmed in a private meeting on June 10 that Social Security garnishments will remain paused. Metheny said she hopes that the administration will consider more relief for borrowers. Are you in default, or concerned about defaulting, on your student loans?</p>
