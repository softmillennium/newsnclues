                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To help mid-sized corporates navigate these changes, Citi Commercial Bank Taiwan recently hosted two client forums, bringing together Citi experts and cross-border trade specialists to share the latest insights and practical strategies. The events drew nearly 200 corporate representatives and were met with strong engagement. Adrienne Lui, Citi Taiwan Economist, noted that despite elevated global uncertainties, Taiwan's strong competitiveness in the AI and semiconductor supply chains positions its corporates well to adapt to shifting trade dynamics and evolving global supply chain structures. She emphasized that regardless of future geopolitical developments, markets such as ASEAN, Mexico, and the EU remain key destinations for Taiwanese companies and reposition their international footprint — due to cost advantages, and regional trade frameworks. The Citi Commercial Bank Taiwan forums featured expert insights from Adrienne Lui and Catherine Simmons, head of Government Affairs for Japan, Australia, North Asia, and South Asia, who provided in-depth analysis on global economic trends and geopolitical developments. Citi's cross-border solutions team also shared insights on how the bank's services can help mid-sized corporates navigate uncertainty and turn emerging challenges into opportunities. As a global bank, Citi is committed to helping our clients adapt their business models and strategies to fast-changing geopolitical and trade dynamics,” said Michelle Yu, head of Citi Commercial Bank Taiwan. She remains positive on Taiwan's economic outlook, supported by AI-driven industrial upgrades and solid GDP growth momentum. Taiwan's competitiveness in AI and semiconductor supply chains provides a strong foundation for navigating trade negotiations and global supply chain adjustments. Beyond these regional frameworks, strengthening trade cooperation with other markets, accelerating de-risking efforts, and pursuing diversified market strategies are necessary considerations for Taiwanese companies seeking to further mitigate risk, enhance competitiveness, and adapt to the evolving global trade system. Citi has been navigating all types of market environments for our clients for more than 200 years and have built a strategy based on a diversified business mix. With a physical presence in more than 90 markets, and a network serving clients in more than 180 countries and jurisdictions, we are uniquely positioned to support our cross-border clients who are at the heart of our strategy and who will need our support as they adapt to this new world order. The combined revenue of the top 10 foundries fell 5.4%, but rush orders and China's subsidies partially offset slowing demand                                        Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC, 台積電) further solidified its dominance in the global wafer foundry business in the first quarter of this year, remaining far ahead of its closest rival, Samsung Electronics Co, TrendForce Corp (集邦科技) said yesterday. TSMC posted US$25.52 billion in sales in the January-to-March period, down 5 percent from the previous quarter, but its market share rose from 67.1 percent the previous quarter to 67.6 percent, TrendForce said in a report.

Despite rising demand and high expectations for humanoid robots, high research-and-development costs and uncertain profitability remain major concerns, Lam told reporters following the company's annual shareholders' meeting in Taoyuan. “Since it seems a bit unworthy to use such high-cost robots to do household chores, I believe robots designed for specific purposes would be more valuable and present a better business opportunity,” Lam said Instead of investing in humanoid robots, Quanta has opted to invest While Gigabyte Technology is optimistic about market demand this year, uncertainty remains due to the impact of potential US tariffs and currency fluctuations                                        Motherboard and graphics card maker Gigabyte Technology Co (技嘉) yesterday said that it plans to launch an artificial intelligence (AI) server assembly line in the US in the second half of this year. Yeh was referring to the “reciprocal” tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump on April 2, which were later postponed for 90 days.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iranian missiles evade Israeli air defences to hit refinery and apartment block south of Tel Aviv Israel attacked Iran's energy industry and defence ministry on the third day of an escalating conflict, as several Iranian missiles evaded Israeli air defences to hit a refinery and rip through a high-rise apartment block south of Tel Aviv. As fuel depots outside Tehran blazed, Donald Trump presided over the US's biggest military parade in decades. He later said the arsenal on display could be deployed against Iran if it targeted American assets. There is little question that Israel would like the US to join its campaign. Only American weapons can attempt to reach parts of the Iranian nuclear project such as the Fordow uranium enrichment plant, which is buried deep under a mountain. But while Iran has called off talks with the US on the future of its nuclear programme, and accused Washington of being Israel's “partner” in the offensive launched on Friday, it has held off attacking US bases, embassies or other targets. With most of its top military echelon assassinated, Israel claiming domination of Iranian airspace from western Iran to Tehran, and several key nuclear sites seriously damaged, the regime in Tehran faces a potentially existential threat. Perhaps in an appeal to Trump's promotion of himself as the ultimate dealmaker, and his election pitch that he would end America's decades of overseas wars, Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, signalled that Iran was open to attempts to de-escalate. If Israeli strikes on Iran stopped, “our responses will also stop”, he said. Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, called the leader of Oman, Sultan Haitham bin Tariq al-Said, who had been due to host US-Iran talks, a government spokesperson said. An Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that even advanced air defences could not stop every missile when Iran launched large barrages, as it did on Saturday night. “Even the greatest aerial defence system doesn't get to 100%.” Israeli attacks on Iran have killed dozens of civilians since Friday, including at least 30 children who died when a missile brought down a high-rise apartment building in Tehran on Saturday. Iran deployed about 70 missiles overnight, and dozens of drones, although Israel has a higher success rate intercepting those slower-moving projectiles. In a statement to the Tel Aviv stock exchange, Bazan group said there were no injuries at its plant but pipelines and transmission lines were damaged forcing some facilities to shut down. Netanyahu said he ordered the pre-emptive operation because Iranian progress towards developing nuclear weapons posed a critical security threat. It hit energy facilities overnight including an oil depot near Tehran that blazed through the night and a refinery in Bushehr province on the Gulf, and has told people living near arms factories in Iran to evacuate their homes. An Israeli military official said in the coming days there would be more attacks on “dual use” facilities, and strikes to prevent Iran expanding its stockpile of missiles, estimated to stand at about 2,000 before Friday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia deliberately targeted a building used by the U.S. aerospace and defense giant Boeing in a recent attack on Kyiv,  the Financial Times reported on June 15. Overnight on June 9-10, Russian forces launched hundreds of drones and seven missiles in one of the biggest attacks on Ukraine, damaging buildings across the capital. "This is not just an attack against Ukraine, but also an attack where American business is being hit," Andy Hunder, President of the ACC in Ukraine, which represents nearly 700 U.S. and international investors and corporate members, told the Kyiv Independent. The strikes on Kyiv came after Ukraine surprised Russia with Operation Spiderweb that saw hundreds of drones target four airbases in Russia and damage 41 war planes. Boeing told the FT that none of its employees were injured in the attack and that it continues to operate in Ukraine, where it employs some 1,000 people. Antonov has also suffered from Russian strikes, as have other defense production sites. As Ukraine pushes for domestic defense production instead of relying on foreign imports, Ukrainian officials say that Moscow is attempting to hinder Ukraine's efforts to manufacture arms. German defense company Rheinmetall opened up a factory in Ukraine last October to produce a batch of Lynx infantry fighting vehicles. Moscow threatened the company, saying it was a legitimate target, although Rheinmetall said its facilities are well protected. Nearly half of the ACC's members have had facilities damaged or destroyed, but 90% still continue to operate in Ukraine, Hunder said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A resident of Saadat Abad, a wealthy neighborhood in north Tehran which has been hit in Israel's strikes, told CNN they heard explosions all night, some so powerful that it shook their entire apartment building. Like other people in Iran who spoke with CNN, the resident asked to remain anonymous out of concern for their safety. There was chaos as residents ran down to the ground level after smelling smoke from a nearby building that had also been targeted, the resident said. Families with young children struggled to keep them calm. “In Tehran there weren't any shelters, people went into basements,” the chairman of Tehran's City Council, Mehdi Chamran, told reporters Sunday, adding that the metro can be used as a shelter “in extreme crisis” but that “we would need to shut the system down.” Related live story Israel ‘not pausing for a moment' as fresh blasts rock Tehran “We don't support the Iranian regime, but we are against Israel attacking residential areas and civilians,” said an older male Tehran resident. “If Israel is against Iran's nuclear program and military capabilities, they should target those areas and not create another situation like what is happening in Gaza.” Israel has destroyed swathes of the Palestinian territory and displaced almost all of Gaza's population in its war against Hamas, an Iranian ally. Shelves in grocery stores are stocked and previously arranged gatherings go ahead, but the drumbeat of conflict is never too far off. Cashpoints are working but at some the amount of cash that can be withdrawn has been limited. But residents told CNN that the roads are so gridlocked it is difficult to move. One family, who didn't want to be named, decided to leave Tehran with their two small children and their elderly parents. They are worried that the government has housed officials and military leaders within highly populated, upper middle-class neighborhoods – putting civilians at risk. “I don't want to leave my home, but I am not going to put my young children in this position,” the father said. Related article Israel's strikes zeroed in on Iran's nuclear program. Residents are also stocking up on food, water, and diapers. Meanwhile, nights have become very quiet in Tehran, residents said. Many shops are closed and many people have either left the city or are too scared to go to work, they said. Israel's operation against Iran is expected to take “weeks, not days” and is moving forward with implicit US approval, according to White House and Israeli officials. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to “strike every site and every target of the Ayatollah's regime,” referring to the country's Supreme Leader. The Israeli military on Sunday also issued an “urgent” evacuation warning to Iranians living near weapons production facilities, saying being nearby would endanger their lives. In a rare direct address to the people of Iran, Netanyahu on Friday urged its citizens to “stand up and let your voices be heard,” after Israel unleashed deadly strikes on its regional foe. “The time has come for the Iranian people to unite around its flag and its historic legacy, by standing up for your freedom from an evil and oppressive regime,” Netanyahu said in a statement. The Iranian regime remains unpopular at home, where security forces continue their brutal crackdown on dissidents.

Some Iranians expressed anger and asserted they would never cede to Netanyahu's demands. I don't need fake news and propaganda speeches,” she added. Iran has threatened to intensify its own retaliatory attacks if Israel continues hostilities. Over 200 rocket launches from Iran were reported overnight into Sunday, the Israeli government said, and at least 13 people have been killed in Israel, including three children. Iran's authorities have yet to declare a death toll.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The labor actions are built on a decades-long tradition of internationalism, anti-militarism, and anti-imperialism. Their action forced the ship to leave port without its deadly cargo. In Genoa, Italian dockworkers pledged to inspect the same vessel and block it if weapons were found. It built on a decades-long tradition of internationalism, anti-militarism, and anti-imperialism among European dockworkers, including coordinated actions to block weapons to Saudi Arabia in 2019. In November 2023 the European Dockworkers Council, an autonomous organization of 14 base-level dockworker unions across 12 countries, organized a coordinated day of action against war and for world peace. And in October 2024, dockworkers from Greece's Port of Piraeus stopped a shipment carrying arms. The most sustained action came earlier this year, after 68 percent of Swedish Dockworkers Union members voted to stage a six-day boycott of all military cargo to and from Israel. The boycott was entirely legal, and Sweden's labor courts unanimously upheld it in a preliminary ruling. Yet on the very day of that legal victory, SDU spokesperson and national deputy chair Erik Helgeson was fired by his employer, Gothenburg RoRo Terminal. His dismissal was a blatant act of retaliation and an attack on workers' right to organize and take meaningful political action. Following a breakdown in contract negotiations, they launched industrial action in May, striking on demands that include stronger protections for union representatives. Dockworkers across Europe have acted in solidarity with the striking Swedish dockers. Belgian dockworkers from the ACV union in Ghent and Zeebrugge refused to handle a ship loaded by strike-breakers from the Swedish city of Gothenburg. All of this is unfolding against the backdrop of Israel's ongoing attack on Gaza, abetted by the U.S. and other Western governments who continue to provide arms to Israel. Entire communities have been reduced to rubble by Israel's daily bombing. Palestinian trade unionists who remain in Gaza are working tirelessly to keep their communities alive — running soup kitchens, providing mutual aid, and continuing the vital work that trade unions do in times of crisis. Blockades by dockworkers stand out as one of the most concrete and disruptive forms of solidarity that workers can offer when governments refuse to act. The task ahead is to ensure that such solidarity is not exceptional, but woven into the fabric of our unions so that workers are ready to act not just for one moment, but for the long haul.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are few patriarchs within the teen film genre like Mel Horowitz in “Clueless.” Although “Clueless” is loosely based on Jane Austen's 1815 novel “Emma,” the film's director Amy Heckerling drew on a range of influences outside of Emma's father, the charming Mr. Woodhouse. “I suppose the main inspiration for Mel was my father – an angry accountant. He was always yelling about one thing or another,” Heckerling recently told CNN over email. “I never seemed to figure out how to diffuse his anger, unless we were driving and I'd stick in a Benny Goodman or Mills Brothers tape.” Heckerling continued to build Mel, taking cues from detective and gangster archetypes, looking for an actor who would be normally cast in such roles – like “Law & Order” star Jerry Orbach or Quentin Tarantino fixture Harvey Keitel. Both were approached, but prior filming commitments and a strict budget for “Clueless” kept either from landing the role. I was so happy we were able to get him,” she said of casting the character actor, whose other credits include 1996's “The First Wives Club” and playing Richard Nixon in “Dick” in 1999. Mel “treats him like a son,” according to Heckerling. Studying law, Josh spends an inordinate amount of time at the Horowitz mansion, aiding Mel in his legal cases and referring to him as “dad,” much to Cher's chagrin. But in Mel's words, “You divorce wives, not children.” While other characters who encounter Mel appear to find him scary, “Cher only sees lovable daddy,” Heckerling observed. Cher possesses the ability to stay positive and calm in the face of her dad's fury, which is something Heckerling learned when dealing with her own father: “If anger is coming at you, it doesn't mean you have to let it in.” In a touching scene toward the film's climax, Mel lists Cher's personal achievements, mentioning that her organizational skills and caring nature reminds him of Cher's dearly departed mother. Although Mel is seen as tough, he's also fair. Just make sure you don't sit in Mel's chair.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Montreal, Canada – Civil rights advocates and Palestinian solidarity groups in Canada have raised alarm over a growing wave of municipal bylaws prohibiting protests outside houses of worship, schools, and other sites. They say the measures — which have been passed in Canada's largest city, Toronto, among other places, and are being considered elsewhere — infringe on freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly. Activists have also warned that the bylaws are part of a wider push to stifle demonstrations against Israel's genocidal war against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. “It's based in anti-Palestinian racism and based in the characterization of those who would protest in favor of Palestinian human rights, against the ongoing genocide, as all being supporters of terrorism, which is clearly not the case.” On May 22, the Toronto city council passed what has been colloquially referred to as a “bubble zone” bylaw, prohibiting certain rallies within 50 meters (164 feet) of places of worship, schools, child care centers, and other institutions. Individuals found to be violating the bylaw — which will come into force on July 2, 2025 — will face a fine of up to $5,000 Canadian ($3,650 USD). And while the Toronto bylaw states that it “does not prohibit peaceful gatherings, protests or demonstrations,” civil rights advocates say unequivocally that the measure — and others like it — aims to stifle demonstrations. David Mivasair, a rabbi and active member of the group Independent Jewish Voices-Canada, said the wave of Toronto-area bylaws came in response to a large demonstration that was held last year at a local synagogue. “If car thieves were running a used car sale in the parking lot of a synagogue, and the police knew that's what was going on, they would shut it down immediately. What we had was land thieves selling properties inside a synagogue,” Mivasair told Truthout. He added that the purported issue that the bylaws are seeking to address — religious-based intimidation targeting people at their houses of worship — is a false problem. “No one that I'm aware of has ever protested at a house of worship while people are worshipping because they're somehow opposed to people worshipping. That's not what's going on,” he told Truthout in an interview. Instead, Mivasair said the bylaws “are intentionally designed — engineered — by major Zionist organisations in Canada who want to suppress honest, public discourse about Israel and Palestine” and outlaw Israel-related protests. Indeed, the demonstration at the synagogue had drawn the ire of pro-Israel lobby groups in Canada, which had been calling for protests to be banned near Jewish community institutions after Israel's Gaza war began in October 2023. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney appears to be considering a federal prohibition in line with what the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs and other pro-Israel lobby groups have been calling for. On May 22, Carney wrote in a social media post denouncing the deadly shooting of Israeli embassy workers outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., that his government would “introduce legislation to make it a criminal offence to intentionally and willfully obstruct access to any place of worship, schools and community centres.” The legislation would also make it “a criminal offence to willfully intimidate or threaten those attending services at these locations,” the prime minister said. It states that those freedoms can only be limited if such limits “can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.” Christine Van Geyn, litigation director at the Canadian Constitution Foundation, said last month that the bylaws fail to meet that test. This new bylaw [in Toronto] will prohibit public protests on matters of public interest and will unjustifiably infringe on the right to freedom of expression,” Van Geyn said in a statement. “While many Canadians disagree with and are upset with some of the protests we have seen in Toronto lately, there is no right not to be offended. “People who were pretty zealous to have a bylaw passed — and it was largely some of the pro-Israeli lobby groups — were able to pressure council enough that they undid most of the narrow provisions” in the earlier draft, Turk said. “I think there's a very good possibility that it will be overturned,” he said. McSorley at the International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group said the measures must be seen as part of a wider pushback against “language and opinions and actions … that disturb, which offend, and which make people feel uncomfortable.” “It's not something that we can legislate out of existence,” he said. “If we bring in laws banning protests outside of certain areas, it sets a precedent. The worry would be that this makes it easier to then bring in other laws restricting protests, or expanding what kind of institutions would fall under these kinds of exclusions.” “At the heart of it, this is about restricting public debate and protest in a democratic society,” he added.

Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) ignited an electrical substation during a sabotage operation in the Russian city of Kaliningrad, causing $5 million in damage and cutting electricity to a military production site, a source in HUR told the Kyiv Independent. In the early hours of June 14, Ukrainian agents drained the coolant from the substation's power transformer before setting the facility on fire. The inferno inflicted major damage on the facility and caused a power cut, impacting nearby Russian military sites. "We once again remind you that Russia no longer has a rear either in the east, in the west, or anywhere else on the planet. Everything Russian involved in the war against Ukraine will burn, sink, and be destroyed regardless of its level of protection or location," the source said.

Ukraine continues to carry out numerous secretive attacks within Russia and occupied Ukrainian territories, targeting military sites, like airfields, as well as key infrastructure like railways and oil refineries. 

The attacks involve HUR, Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) as well as partisan and sabotage groups. HUR was behind explosions near Desantnaya Bay in Russia's far eastern Vladivostok on May 30, which reportedly damaged military personnel and equipment. The operations took place approximately 6,800 kilometres from the Ukrainian border, making it Ukraine's furthest incursion into Russian territory, if confirmed. On June 1, the SBU launched Operation Spiderweb, a game-changing drone attack on four key Russian military airfields, damaging 41 planes, including heavy bombers and rare A-50 spy planes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former French president loses country's highest state award despite Emmanuel Macron's opposition to move The former French president Nicolas Sarkozy has been stripped of his Legion of Honour, the country's highest distinction, after his conviction for corruption was confirmed last year, according to an official decree published on Sunday. The conservative one-term president has been beset by legal problems since leaving office in 2012. In December France's highest court upheld his conviction for influence peddling and corruption, ordering him to wear an electronic ankle tag for 12 months. Sarkozy, who remains an important figure in French politics, had been found guilty by a lower court in 2021 of trying to bribe a judge and peddling influence in exchange for confidential information about an investigation into his 2007 campaign finances. His lawyer, Patrice Spinosi, said he had taken note of the award's revocation but stressed that the appeal was still pending. Emmanuel Macron argued against the decision, but the rules of France's top state award stipulate that any recipient definitively sentenced to a term in prison equal to or greater than a year will be excluded from the order. The French president, who is known to meet Sarkozy regularly, had argued that his predecessor had been elected to the country's highest office and it was “very important that former presidents are respected”. He has been convicted of illegal campaign financing in his failed 2012 re-election bid, and is currently on trial on charges of accepting illegal campaign financing from the late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. The court is expected to deliver its verdict in the latter case in September, and prosecutors have asked for a seven-year prison term.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A natural gas pipeline terminus in Kitimat, B.C., September, 2022. Natural gas is among the world's most strategically important energy sources.DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press Robert Johnston is senior director of research at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy. Kathleen Gnocato is a research analyst at the Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy, at the University of Toronto. They are contributors to a recent report from RBC on natural gas. The G7 was created in the 1970s in response to a worsening Cold War, global energy shock and ensuing economic crisis. More than 50 years later, the same group of leading liberal democracies are meeting this week in Canada to address an eerily similar set of conditions. For Europe, North America and Japan, security is back. We saw in the early days of the Ukraine war how Russia weaponized gas, signalling what aggression can do to markets. The enormous U.S. build-out of liquefied natural gas has created different distortions for a global gas market that is still evolving. Renewed conflict in the Middle East is adding to that insecurity, particularly as gas-rich Qatar, directly across the Persian Gulf from Iran, accounts for nearly 20 per cent of global LNG exports, and is aiming to double production by 2040. As the G7 host, Canada is uniquely positioned to help resolve those challenges and set a new course for energy security, global stability, climate action – and the role of natural gas in all three. Canada to seek agreements in global peace, energy security and new partnerships at G7, Carney says Natural gas is already among the world's most strategically important energy sources, meeting roughly a quarter of today's needs, and is widely seen as a critical source to power a global population of 9.2 billion by 2040, along with the energy-intensive needs of heavy manufacturing – think reshoring of entire industries – and even hungrier artificial intelligence projects. Most energy forecasts suggest that in 2040 the world will require more gas, but how much? To map out different pathways, RBC joined forces with Oslo-based Rystad Energy and a group of international researchers in modelling scenarios based on geopolitical forces, policy choices and economic conditions. In one of our scenarios – we call it “Dystopian” because it features shattered international co-operation and unmanaged energy demand – we found the world would need twice as much gas as it produces today. In contrast, another scenario, “Decarbonized,” plays out with rapid decarbonization, where world demand for gas shrinks by roughly a third from today. The difference between those outcomes could be roughly 370 million tonnes a year of gas, the equivalent of today's entire production capacity. Why can't we work together and dream big? However, its members are not aligned on gas's role. A concrete strategy for governments and industry begins with a G7 declaration of support for natural gas as an essential bridge fuel to a lower emissions economy, with clear timelines for the transition to a decarbonized gas market built around clean hydrogen, ammonia, methane abatement and the electrification of LNG production. Other democratic allies – Australia and South Korea, in particular, but India, Mexico and a range of South American countries, too – can get behind a new approach to global gas that meets economic ambitions, energy security needs and meaningful climate ambitions. Without such conviction, the world risks a future marked by energy insecurity for consumers and producers alike.

RABAT, June 15. /TASS/. Further aggravation of the situation in the Middle East caused by the standoff between Iran and Israel may lead to a surge in oil prices to $200-300 per barrel, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Iraq Fuad Hussein said in a telephone conversation with German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul.

"Continuation of the conflict in the region and closing of the Strait of Ormuz may lead to serious economic shocks. Oil prices may grow to $200-300 per barrel in case hostilities start. This may result in inflation growth in European countries and complicate the oil export process for producing countries, such as Iraq," Hussein said, cited by the INA news agency.

"Closing of the pass [Strait of Ormuz - TASS] may lead to a loss of approximately five million barrels of oil per day from the Persian Gulf and Iraq that are coming to the oil market," he stressed.</p>

WASHINGTON, June 15. /TASS/. The administration of US President Donald Trump may ban or restrict the entry to the United States for nationals of 36 countries more, The Washington Post said, with internal documents of the US State Department at its disposal.

According to the news outlet, the list of countries, whose citizens may face the ban for receiving US visas or other restrictions, comprise 25 African countries, including Egypt and Djibouti, and countries of Central Asia and the Caribbean region. An office memo on this topic was signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and sent to diplomats responsible for countries in the list.

Trump earlier banned nationals of twelve countries from entering the United States and introduced restrictions for residents of seven other countries. The full ban will be in effect in respect of citizens of Afghanistan, Haiti, Iran, Yemen, Libya, Myanmar, the Republic of Congo, Somalia, Sudan, Chad, Equatorial Guinea and Eritrea. Furthermore, partial restrictions will be in effect against nationals of Burundi, Venezuela, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo and Turkmenistan.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As tanks thundered through Washington DC to the thrashing of heavy metal music, millions turned out across the US in protest. But if he had hoped the spectacle, which coincided with his 79th birthday, would have seen an outpouring of national pride, then he would have been disappointed. Organisers of what were dubbed the “No Kings” protests claimed at least one million people headed onto the streets to demonstrate against what critics say are the president's monarchical ambitions. And earlier on Saturday, a Democrat lawmaker and her husband were shot in Minnesota in what governor Tim Walz called a “targeted political assassination”. Storm clouds had gathered over the US – quite literally. The grand military parade that Mr Trump had been wanting for years barrelled down the streets of DC with tanks, troops and a 21-gun salute. Mr Trump sat on a special viewing stand south of the White House to watch the display of American military prowess. People did whatever they could to get a view. Standing on concrete pillars, climbing barricades and even opting for the tallest pair of shoulders they could find. The procession, with more than 6,000 soldiers and 128 Army tanks, managed to avoid the looming threat of a thunderstorm, getting away with only a light drizzle. At times, Mr Trump stood and saluted as troops marched past the reviewing stand. But attendance appeared to fall far short of early predictions that as many as 200,000 people would attend the festival and parade. “It's the kind of thing you do in North Korea, or Russia. “I just feel I've come to a point where you need to hopefully convince some folks that in the next election, they pick someone who can take the country in another direction.” It's about time America did too,” Mr Trump said. “The army has forged a legacy of unmatched courage... our soldiers have poured out their blood by the bucketful. Mr Trump has been talking up the strength of the US fighting force amid a looming conflict with Iran, saying that enemies that have challenged it have regretted doing so. Demonstrations were organised in thousands of towns and cities against the celebration, which critics have likened to a dictatorship. An estimated million people turned out to march against Saturday's spectacle, organisers claimed. Aerial photos showed swathes of protests marching through city streets. Some protesters held up Mexican flags, while others bore anti-Trump signs and posters which said “no human is illegal”. Dozens of Marines stood shoulder to shoulder in full combat gear beside the National Guard, Homeland Security officers and other law enforcement, as hundreds of protesters facing them jeered in English and Spanish, telling the troops to go home. Some held signs that included “Where's the due process?” and “No to Trump's fascist military parade” as they marched towards the White House “No Kings” rallies unfolded in hundreds of cities, designed to counter what organisers said were Mr Trump's plans to feed his ego on his birthday and Flag Day. My dad was in the military,” he added. A flyover of military aircraft included World War II-era planes, including a B-25 Mitchell bomber, and Army helicopters flew low over the crowd. Mounted soldiers from the 1st Cavalry Division made an appearance – horses once played a crucial role in warfare. And have a great life,” he said to them afterwards. The night ended with a rendition of God Bless the USA by Lee Greenwood and a firework display, which had followed the crowd singing “Happy Birthday” to a beaming Mr Trump. Read our live blog below for a recap of the full event. Thanks for following our live coverage of the US Army's birthday parade in Washington, DC. Donald Trump has been serenaded by the crowd gathered in Washington, DC with a chorus of “Happy Birthday”. Donald Trump pays tribute to a series of American military heroes, including Creighton Abrams, the Second World War general. “The army has forged a legacy of unmatched courage... our soldiers have poured out their blood by the bucketful,” he says. “Liberty got its shield and freedom got its sword” with the founding of the US Army 250 years ago, Donald Trump says. “Our warriors have shown unrivalled valour on field of valour around the globe... they have marched into the flames and fury of combat, charged up mountains, stormed the beaches, waded through torrents of gunfire,” he continued. “Our souls are filled with gratitude for every generation of warriors who have worn the uniform of our country all the way back to the very beginning,” Donald Trump says, beginning a speech. He pays tribute to troops who have made the “supreme sacrifice” and “laid down their lives”. A concert is now underway after the military parade concluded and Donald Trump delivered the oath of enlistment to soldiers. Saturday's “No Kings” demonstrations against Donald Trump's military celebration could be some of the largest in US history. “No Kings in America,” he wrote on social media. In a separate post, he said: “I was so proud to be in New York City today supporting Americans making their voice heard at No Kings protests and pushing back on Donald Trump's authoritarian push to rig the economy for his billionaire buddies.” M1 Abrams tanks are rolling along the streets of DC, accompanied by Bradley Fighting Vehicles and Strykers. A formidable battle tank, the 70-ton Abrams combines devastating firepower with a heavy composite armour to protect its four-man crew. People are doing whatever they can to get a view. Standing on concrete pillars, climbing barricades and even opting for the tallest pair shoulders they can find. Your 6ft6 hack has so far avoided requests for a seat. JD Vance's kids, who appear to be losing their minds at the tanks that have just rolled passed. It is unclear which aircraft they were referring to, but the overcast skies did not stop a Second World War-era B-25 bomber flying over the crowd with a P-51 Mustang at each wingtip. Donald Trump salutes with one hand and pumps his fist as they move along Constitution Ave, led by a flag-bearer. It was preceded by a B-25 bomber, which became famous for conducting bombing raids of Japan. JD Vance, the vice president, has published a photo of his children watching the military parade as it heads through Washington, DC. “Quite a view!” he wrote on social media. They appear to be standing behind bulletproof glass. Donning a white shirt embroidered with that an American flag the size of his back, he's here for one thing only; the military. He has travelled a staggering two days with his family to reach the foot of the monument with a perfect view of the stage where Trump will speak tonight. My dad was in the military,” he adds. It's a moving timeline of the army's history. Uniformed servicemen have begin marching through the streets of Washington DC as the US army's 250th anniversary parade kicks off proper. Soldiers carrying American flags have joined bands to march along a stretch of the National Mall. Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, can be seen applauding and smiling, with the President occasionally saluting the soldiers. Following reports the festivities could be postponed or even cancelled owing to the weather, Donald Trump this morning wrote on Truth Social that the celebration would go ahead “rain or shine”. Crowds cheered and screamed as Mr and Mrs Trump entered, shortly after which a gun salute rang out against a back drop of chants of “USA, USA”. Chief Musician SSG Caroline Nielson is now performing a rendition of the Star Spangled Banner. “It's the kind of thing you do in North Korea, or Russia. “I just feel I've come to a point where you need to hopefully convince some folks that in the next election, they pick someone who can take the country in another direction.” We're interrupted by a man who shouts, “Trump is my king”. “There are some proud boy who walked by me and showed me a gang sign or something threatening, he adds”. Originally from Vietnam, Ms Muygen says the president's pledged to clamp down on illegal immigration is why she voted for him. “I'm an immigrant from Vietnam and we came here legally. It took a long time to come here and we pay tax. After five years we applied to become citizens,” she said. Ms Muygen became a US citizen after legally entering the country and living in LA for more than two decades “I see people just crossing the border and guessing in it's not fair you have to come here legally.” But my goodness have they given a good go here in Washington. It is instead akin to something much more like a family friendly day out. Donald Trump's wife, Melania, is to make an appearance at the festivities later today. Mrs Trump is understood to potentially be joining her husband onstage. I was proud to stand with more than 500 people in Stowe today at a No Kings protest.Today, all over the country, tens of thousands of Americans are saying NO to the authoritarianism that has taken hold of our country. “No Kings” protesters marched through the streets of Los Angeles following a week of riots over ICE arrests in the city. Thousands of protesters could be seen, some carrying Mexican flags, marching through the Southern Californian city's streets. Critics have drawn parallels between today's display of military mite and the deployment of National Guard troops and Marines on the streets of LA to help police the riots. A steady stream of protesters is heading past The Telegraph's Washington, DC offices, apparently heading to the White House. Footage posted on social media shows demonstrators streaming down 14th Street, waving banners that read “The fascist Trump regime must go” and “Trump must go now”. It raises the prospect of clashes with law enforcement, after Donald Trump vowed anyone who disrupted his military parade would face “very heavy force”. A spokesperson for the United States Capitol Police (USCP) confirmed they were aware of the violent incident in Minnesota today. John Hoffman, a Democratic state senator, and his spouse were also shot multiple times. Both have received surgery and are expected to survive, officials say. We have been working with our federal, state and local partners. For safety reasons, we cannot provide specific details about our security posture.” Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has wished Donald Trump and the US Army a “double happy birthday”. “We appreciate what you're doing now, helping protect Israeli lives against the criminal regime in Iran,” he said. We would not have a free world without you. Thank you on behalf of free peoples everywhere.” “No Kings” protest leaflets have been found in the car of a man suspected of shooting dead a Democrat politician and her husband in Minnesota. John Hoffman, a Democratic state senator, and his spouse were also shot multiple times. The pair are expected to survive, officials said. Minnesota police released an image of dozens of leaflets about the “No Kings” protests, demonstrating against Donald Trump and his military parade, on the seat of a car belonging to the suspect. “Given the targeted shootings of state lawmakers overnight, we are asking the public to not attend today's planned demonstrations across Minnesota out of an abundance of caution,” they said in a statement. As US tanks and troops parade through the streets of Washington, DC, protests are expected to take place across the country. Organisers say the “No Kings” demonstrations, protesting against Donald Trump, will be held in around 2,000 towns and cities across the US - but not the capital, to avoid clashes with law enforcement. They hope to create a “split-screen” between the displays of military power in Washington contrasted against anti-Trump protests elsewhere. Donald Trump has insisted the military celebration will go ahead “rain or shine” following a report that the military celebration could be cancelled or rescheduled owing to adverse weather conditions. Residents of America's capital last night also received mobile phone alerts, warning them of flash flooding in the city. However, Mr Trump this morning wrote on his Truth Social site: “Our great military parade is on, rain or shine. Remember, a rainy day [parade] brings good luck. There are thunderstorms forecast for the weekend, and protesters planning to rain on his military parade, but there's one piece of good news for Donald Trump on his 79th birthday. Polling shared with The Telegraph shows significant support for the president's deployment of troops to clamp down on riots in Los Angeles, with the public backing his move by a margin of 14 per cent. Initially, Mr Trump's decision to send the National Guard and US Marines to the city of angels had threatened to cast a cloud over his parade on Saturday, with soldiers detaining US citizens during what was meant to be a shared celebration of the country's military history.

We'll be bringing you the latest from Washington, DC ahead of a military parade through the US capital later today, which coincides with Donald Trump's 79th birthday.</p>
