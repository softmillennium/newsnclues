                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With them, an ecologically vital function also disappeared: the dispersal of seeds from large-fruited plants. A new study led by the University of O'Higgins, Chile, with key contributions from IPHES-CERCA, demonstrates for the first time -- based on direct fossil evidence -- that these extinct elephant relatives regularly consumed fruit and were essential allies of many tree species. Some plant species that relied on mastodons for seed dispersal are now critically endangered. Published in Nature Ecology & Evolution, the research presents the first solid evidence of frugivory in Notiomastodon platensis, a South American Pleistocene mastodon. The findings are based on a multiproxy analysis of 96 fossil teeth collected over a span of more than 1,500 kilometers, from Los Vilos to Chiloé Island in southern Chile. In 1982, biologist Daniel Janzen and paleontologist Paul Martin proposed a revolutionary idea: many tropical plants developed large, sweet, and colorful fruits to attract large animals -- such as mastodons, native horses, or giant ground sloths -- that would serve as seed dispersers. Known as the "neotropical anachronisms hypothesis," this theory remained unconfirmed for over forty years. Now, the study led by González-Guarda provides direct fossil evidence that validates it. To understand the lifestyle of this mastodon, the team employed various techniques: isotopic analysis, microscopic dental wear studies, and fossil calculus analysis. "We found starch residues and plant tissues typical of fleshy fruits, such as those of the Chilean palm (Jubaea chilensis)," explains Florent Rivals, ICREA research professor at IPHES-CERCA and an expert in paleodiet. "This directly confirms that these animals frequently consumed fruit and played a role in forest regeneration." "Through stable isotope analysis, we were able to reconstruct the animals' environment and diet with great precision," notes Iván Ramírez-Pedraza. "Dental chemistry gives us a direct window into the past," says Carlos Tornero. "By combining different lines of evidence, we've been able to robustly confirm their frugivory and the key role they played in these ecosystems." The extinction of mastodons broke a co-evolutionary alliance that had lasted for millennia. The results are alarming: in central Chile, 40% of these species are now threatened -- a rate four times higher than in tropical regions where animals such as tapirs or monkeys still act as alternative seed dispersers. "Where that ecological relationship between plants and animals has been entirely severed, the consequences remain visible even thousands of years later," says study co-author Andrea P. Loayza. "Paleontology isn't just about telling old stories," concludes Florent Rivals. Note: Content may be edited for style and length.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Their study finds that despite the Galactic Center's dense clouds of gas and dust, conditions that typically produce stars with high masses, these star-forming regions struggle to form high-mass stars. Furthermore, the studied areas appear to lack sufficient material for continued star formation, suggesting such regions effectively produce just one generation of stars, unlike typical star-forming regions. "Recent studies have concluded that star formation is likely depressed near the Galactic Center, and even that there may be no present star formation occurring there," said De Buizer, lead author of the study. "Since presently-forming massive stars are brightest at long infrared wavelengths, we obtained the highest resolution infrared images of our Galaxy's central-most star-forming regions. The data show that, contrarily, massive stars are presently forming there, but confirm at a relatively low rate." These conditions could inhibit gas clouds from holding together long enough to form stars in the first place and prevent those that do form stars from staying together long enough for continued future star formation. Although its rate of present massive star formation is unusually low, like the other Galactic Center regions studied, it seems to have maintained its reservoir of dense gas and dust, allowing for a future emergent star cluster to be born. Traditionally, astronomers have viewed giant H II regions -- large clouds of gas, mainly hydrogen, in space like Sgr B1 and Sgr C -- as hosts of massive star clusters still embedded in their birth clouds. The team argues these two regions may not fit the classical definition at all, or they may represent a new, previously unrecognized category of stellar nursery. Enshrouded in gas and dust that obscure these star-forming regions from view in all but the longest infrared wavelengths, SOFIA's high-resolution infrared eyes allowed the team to identify more than six dozen presently-forming massive stars within the Galactic Center regions. However, these regions formed fewer stars -- and topped out at a lower stellar mass -- than the Galactic average. "These Galactic Center star-forming regions are in many ways very similar to the massive star-forming regions in the relatively calm backwaters of our galaxy," said Lim.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Together, the papers in Nature Metabolism and Nature Communications trace the first complementary wiring diagram of hunger and satiety in ways that could refine today's blockbuster weight-loss drugs and blunt their side effects. One study, led by Zhiping Pang of Robert Wood Johnson Medical School's Center for NeuroMetabolism, pinpointed a slender bundle of neurons that runs from the hypothalamus to the brainstem. Fasting weakened the connection until a burst of natural or synthetic GLP-1 restored it. "The synapse is a volume knob that only turns up when energy stores are low," Pang said, warning that drugs that keep the signal high around the clock could disrupt the brain's normal rhythm and create some of the side effects of GLP-1 drugs such as nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea and muscle wasting. When researchers triggered the connection, a suddenly hungry mouse would sprint for sugar water; when they blocked it, the animals lounged even after a long fast. An injection of ghrelin, the gut's hunger messenger, revved food seeking, while leptin, the satiety signal, slammed it shut. Overfed mice gradually lost the response, but it returned after diets made them thin again. "Pang's pathway shuts things down," Rossi said. It is the first time researchers have watched the push-pull mechanism operate in parallel pathways, a yin-yang arrangement that may explain why diets and drugs that treat only one side of the equation often lose power over time and may help in making drugs that work even better than today's generation of GLP-1 medications. GLP-1 mimics such as Wegovy and Zepbound can trigger double-digit weight loss but also nausea, diarrhea and, in some cases, muscle wasting. Pang's data suggest a therapy targeting only the brainstem circuit and sparing peripheral organs might curb eating without the side effects. Conversely, Rossi's work hints that restoring the body's response to the hunger-regulating hormone ghrelin could help dieters who plateau after months of calorie cutting. Those techniques allowed the researchers to tune individual pathways with a precision that has only recently become possible. Follow-up work from both teams will explore more questions that could improve drug design. "You want to keep the system's flexibility," Rossi said. Allowing the brain to correctly rebalance the desire to eat or stop eating throughout the day, rather than using drugs to keep desire constantly low, may be an important ingredient in tomorrow's weight-loss prescriptions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Satellite data used by archaeologists to find traces of ancient ruins hidden under dense forest canopies can also be used to improve the speed and accuracy to measure how much carbon is retained and released in forests. Understanding this carbon cycle is key to climate change research, according to Hamdi Zurqani, an assistant professor of geospatial science for the Arkansas Forest Resources Center and the College of Forestry, Agriculture and Natural Resources at the University of Arkansas at Monticello. "Forests are often called the lungs of our planet, and for good reason," Zurqani said. "They store roughly 80 percent of the world's terrestrial carbon and play a critical role in regulating Earth's climate." Though effective, traditional ground-based methods for estimating forest aboveground biomass are labor-intensive, time-consuming and limited in spatial coverage abilities, Zurqani said. In a study recently published in Ecological Informatics, Zurqani shows how information from open-access satellites can be integrated on Google Earth Engine with artificial intelligence algorithms to quickly and accurately map large-scale forest aboveground biomass, even in remote areas where accessibility is often an issue. Zurqani's novel approach uses data from NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation LiDAR, also known as GEDI LiDAR, which includes three lasers installed on the International Space Station. Zurqani also used imagery data from the European Space Agency's collection of Earth observation Copernicus Sentinel satellites -- Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. The study tested four machine learning algorithms to analyze the data: Gradient tree boosting, random forest, classification and regression trees, or CART, and support vector machine. Random forest came in second, proving reliable but slightly less precise. CART provided reasonable estimates but tended to focus on a smaller subset. The support vector machine algorithm struggled, Zurqani said, highlighting that not all AI models are equally suited for estimating aboveground forest biomass in this study. Zurqani said that accurate forest biomass mapping has real-world implications for better accounting of carbon and improved forest management on a global scale. He added that future research may explore deeper AI models, such as neural networks, to refine predictions further. "As climate change intensifies, technology like this will be indispensable in safeguarding our forests and the planet." Note: Content may be edited for style and length.
