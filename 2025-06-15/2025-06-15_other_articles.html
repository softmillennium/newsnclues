                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's no secret that Supernatural was always at its best when it committed to being a horror series. But there is one Supernatural episode that sticks out as being a masterclass in comedic timing, blending the show's intense mytharc with one of the most ingenious characters the series put together. I'm talking about Season 5's "Changing Channels," which makes me laugh and holler every time I turn it on. When "Changing Channels" starts, we're already thrown head-first into the wild antics that are about to ensure. With an intro that feels like Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) have been transported to a bad '90s sitcom, we're then delighted with a theme song (dubbed "Together We'll Face the Day") that shows us just what we're in store for. Frankly, there are few comedic episodes of the show that are structured as well as "Changing Channels," and it's easy to see why it remains such a fan favorite to this day. It's certainly one of my favorite episodes, even if I generally prefer the show's standard horror dramas. What other show can throw its leading characters into "TV Land" (or "TV Hell," if you rather), flipping through different genres and shows as if some otherworldly viewer were changing channels on them? Penned by future showrunner Jeremy Carver, "Changing Channels" is quite inspired. This episode takes the Winchesters through soapy medical dramas, Japanese game shows, a Knight Rider parody, and more. There's so much to unpack here, with plenty of hilarious "in" moments and references for longtime fans, not to mention all the great material for Ackles and Padalecki to work with. Of course, it's also a Trickster (Richard Speight Jr.) episode, so just like "Tall Tales" or "Mystery Spot," we can expect this one to get a bit crazy, and it delivers in the best of ways. In a season that was so often focused on the looming Apocalypse, "Changing Channels" uniquely addresses Sam and Dean's destiny while still living up to the show's clever and hilarious antics. I've certainly shown this single episode to folks who had only vague ideas of what Supernatural is about, and the response is always the same. Ever since Season 2's "Tall Tales" and "Hollywood Babylon," Supernatural steered further and further into the meta space, and Season 5 is where a lot of that comes to a head. But "Changing Channels" (which aired only a week prior) explored these meta ideas another way. On the Japanese game show "Nutcracker!," for instance, the episode asks Sam and Dean questions about their life and childhood. (I love the whole bit about Sam being asked about his connections to Ruby, it's a great in-joke that works perfectly for devoted fans.) Additionally, the show riffs on other shows and genres as well, spoofing Grey's Anatomy, NCIS, and other procedurals that so often feel like the same thing over and over again. As the show continued, episodes like "The French Mistake" and "Fan Fiction" would continue this trend, but only "Changing Channels" was able to blend meta humor about Supernatural itself with television as a whole. What I think is especially great is that it doesn't just stick to the types of shows or content currently on air. That's not even getitng into the commercial sequence for "Herpexia," where Sam is forced to talk about his experience with genital herpes. In addition to naming the aforementioned "The French Mistake" as one of his favorite episodes, series creator Eric Kripke told Entertainment Weekly in 2016 that "Changing Channels" was his other most-watched episode. Although he didn't write the episode, I fully understand why Kripke is drawn to both "Changing Channels" and "The French Mistake." It's hard to say, and I think that's why Kripke cites both as his favorite episodes rather than choosing between them. But if you're looking to revisit a great Supernatural episode with hysterical stakes and a deep, impactful ending, then "Changing Channels" ought to be the one you choose.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's an Evangelical offshoot, rooted in Pentecostalism, that leans far more heavily into revelations and prophecy than mainstream Christian churches and wields out-sized powerful political influence. That was evident recently at King Jesus Ministry, a nondenominational megachurch where President Donald Trump's top spiritual advisor, pastor Paula White-Cain, has been a visitor over the years. Another Miami megachurch with a prominent Haitian-American congregation, Tabernacle of Glory, has credited its large following with its emphasis on the supernatural. The nondenominational church opened its $60 million campus in northern Miami-Dade County last year. At these churches, it's not uncommon to hear pastors talking about ‘dominion' theologies or ‘cosmic spiritual warfare.' Sometimes, they may speak in tongues or even perform a ‘deliverance' or what most people know as an exorcism, to cast out demonic forces. They've built increasing influence in American politics, supporting candidacies of conservative leaders like President Donald Trump. “Independent Charismatic leaders, who 20 years ago would have been mocked by mainstream religious right leaders, are now front-line captains in the American culture wars,” writes religious scholar Matthew Taylor, in his book “The Violent Take it By Force.” The Miami Herald spoke to Taylor to discuss some of the themes and ideologies that are found in these churches and how they intersect with American political circles. This term is popular in charismatic Christian circles and might refer to a church where supernatural experiences — some not defined by logic or reason — take place. But the charismatic Christian world also is a “diffuse” space, where many terms are interchangeable or sometimes defined differently from church to church, said Taylor. Want more of our free, weekly newsletters in your inbox? “To be charismatic is to seek after the more supernatural dimensions of Christianity ... and this is why they're constantly emphasizing prophecy, constantly emphasizing speaking in tongues and healings and miracles,” said Taylor. There's an entire Christian media network, for example, led by charismatic leader Sid Roth called “It's Supernatural! that has been around for decades, said Taylor. Many of the leaders in this movement — like Pastor Guillermo Maldonado of King Jesus and White-Cain — are considered by the faithful to be modern-day Apostles or Prophets who can perform ‘healings' or deliver prophecies during sermons. Since the movement often operates without a formal connection to more established denominations, leaders may have varying degrees of theological education but will lean on or cite mentors in the movement. The leaders often have ten or hundreds of thousands of followers, or a background in televangelism, and their success can sometimes depend on who they know in the charismatic world — similar, Taylor writes, to how Hollywood operates. Taylor, who has interviewed many charismatic Christian leaders, describes them as “idiosyncratic” and “incredibly compelling” people. Many apostolic leaders believe the Christian church has languished for centuries, and that God has brought them in to reinvigorate the church through Holy Spirit-backed leadership. There's also an emphasis, similar to Pentecostal churches, on promoting inner healing through living a more Christian lifestyle. The promise of a better, healthier life can appeal to those who are struggling with addiction problems, health — physical or mental — problems or financial hardship. This idea is common in many churches that ask members to ‘tithe,' but this movement stresses that more giving can mean more rewards. Many followers find a sense of empowerment, contentment and community in the movement, Taylor says. “There have been studies even on how Pentecostal and charismatic ministries around the world have done a great deal of lifting people out of a lower-class existence economically by empowering them and telling them ‘Hey, you have agency. At the same time, Taylor points out, those experiences are “being utilized in this broader political project,” to get more Christians on board with conservative political agendas. Another theory of why it's so popular: In a modern, industrialized world where knowledge is at the fingertips of everyone with a Smartphone, charismatic leaders could be ‘re-enchanting' the world for people who want more of a sense of mystery and wonder, said Taylor, referring to the concept of ‘disenchantment' made popular by philosopher, Charles Taylor. “People want a sense of a sublime and powerful force in the universe that's guiding and moving them around,” he said. It's similar, but without the bylaws and bureaucratic oversight that comes with a denomination, or network of churches with an established hierarchy. “They believe that ‘We need the Holy Spirit to be unrestrained. We need the fires of revival prayer,' said Taylor. “But that same lack of restraint makes it very susceptible to political co-optation, because .. there's not a lot of oversight.” Pentecostalism, a movement within Protestant Christianity, is a denomination that can be traced back as early as 1900's and emphasizes manifestations of the Holy Spirit — such as supernatural healing and speaking in tongues. In the early years of Pentecostalism, its followers were largely poor Angelo and African Americans, according to Pew Research, and women have always had a large role. In the late-1940s, various ‘healing evangelists' began traveling around the country, filling tents and auditoriums that attracted tens of thousands of people, according to Taylor's book. In the 1950s, Roberts teamed up with preacher Kenneth Hagin and began teaching about an ideology called the “Word of Faith” doctrine, which emphasized a form of faith that rewards devout Christians with healings and blessings. Some religious scholars, many who are Christians themselves, point out that the movement is also putting spiritual influence to other uses. You came to move in your Kingdom calling. That threatens people who don't understand the word of God because their language, their understanding is not like yours. “Very soon our Lord and savior Jesus Christ is going to split the sky and come back,” she said during her sermon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By MARTA JARY FOR DAILY MAIL AUSTRALIA Celebrity psychic John Edward is in Australia for a series of his famous live medium events in the coming weeks. 'Not at the moment, not at the moment' Edwards admitted, to which co-host Waleed Aly replied, 'Well I could have done that!' The mockery sparked laughter from the show's panel of hosts, leaving a red-faced Edward to explain why he won't do readings live on television. Celebrity psychic John Edward (pictured) is in Australia for a series of his famous live medium events in the coming weeks If I read for a host of a show and I get something private, this is not taped, it's live, and it's not something that someone wants to discuss publicly, you're going to say no' he said. 'He said, "I have legacy in the marketplace, my audience knows everything about me". In the commercial break, I said, does your audience know you decided not to to have a fifth child and terminate the pregnancy? I asked him, "If I would have said that on the air, what would you have said? John recently has issued a strong message to his non-believers. Speaking to The Daily Telegraph, the medium said he has no qualms about people questioning his abilities - as they have done for decades - but only if they are willing to open their mind. 'I think we're living at a time on the planet where people's critical thinking skills need to be really sharpened and addressed because of whatever the latest AI thing that's happening or just social media – so I think it's really important for people to go, "hey, wait, I'm not sure, let me see what kind of validation is there"' he said. The mockery sparked laughter from the show's panel of hosts, leaving a red-faced Edward to explain why he won't do readings live on television 'But when somebody pushes a little bit too much more, then I have to push back, and I have to be like 'woah – you can't define me, you don't know me'. The New York native also said that he can't wait to return to Australia, as he has always loved the country's 'energy'. He praised the nation's strong sense of community and said Australians always make him feel welcome when he visits. His supposed psychic abilities have been dismissed by many, with critics claiming the reality star is merely practicing a form of cold reading. He has been married to Sandra McGee since 1995 and the couple share two children: son Justin and daughter Olivia. Back in 2017, Edward told news.com.au that he never set out to be a celebrity and that it simply happened as a result of his psychic abilities. 'And I never wanted to be on TV, it was an opportunity that came as a byproduct of my work.' No comments have so far been submitted.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UFO researcher Jaime Maussan, whose research has stirred controversy for nearly a decade, released the video on his show, Maussan Television. He described the sphere as 'likely not from here' and suggested it may be a technology humans do not yet possess. 'When the workers were investigating the crops, this sphere appeared and they were able to capture it with state-of-the-art equipment. He added that the latest sphere appeared nearly identical to the first, recovered in Buga, about 43 miles from Yumbo. Scientists who analyzed the latest video said the object emits an electromagnetic field, generates strong heat and may possess antigravity capabilities. 'We believe these spheres are investigating, observing us, possibly searching for the first one recovered in Buga,' Maussan said in a translated statement. The first Buga sphere, recovered on March 2 by locals, weighed about 4.5 pounds and was described as 'having the temperature of a refrigerator when touched, but emitting strong heat when not.' A team led by Guatemalan researcher Jose Manrique analyzed the Yumbo video and insisted it had been manipulated by A. If it is indeed identical to the first, the object may be inscribed with strange 'alien' writing, a message for humanity, which Manrique's team previously deciphered to say: 'The origin of birth through union and energy in the cycle of transformation, meeting point of unity, expansion, and consciousness — individual consciousness.' Manrique interpreted it as 'a message to humanity, encouraging a collective shift in consciousness to help Mother Earth, especially considering the current issues with pollution and environmental decline.' Scientists who analyzed the latest video said the object emits an electromagnetic field, generates strong heat and may possess antigravity capabilities Vélez el Potro told Maussan in March that the man who found it, Jose, felt sick for days after touching the object. He also claimed that the government contacted him to hand it over the sphere, but he refused, saying, 'It would never be seen again.' Instead, Vélez el Potro gave it to Maussan and his team of experts with hopes of them uncovering the sphere's origin. Pictured is David Velez el Potro who helped find the sphere A team of scientists have recently analyzed the sphere using X-rays and conducted other tests to identify its origins Researchers from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) recently released a new analysis, suggesting a strong, decayed ionized field emits from the Buga sphere. Rodolfo Garrido, a Mexican engineer, said his team weighed the sphere numerous times and were surprised to find it growing heavier, from 16 to 20 and then 22 pounds, without changing in size. Maussan has previously made headlines for sensational, and subsequently debunked, claims, including mummified corpses and other supposed extraterrestrial finds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New James Webb Space Telescope data reveal Pluto's high-altitude haze is a key driver of the climate on the dwarf planet, offering clues to Earth's ancient atmosphere. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have taken a fresh look at the distant edges of our solar system — and found that, once again, Pluto is defying expectations. When NASA's New Horizons spacecraft flew past Pluto in 2015, it shattered the notion that the dwarf planet was a dormant ball of ice, instead revealing it to be rich with icy plains and jagged mountains. Now, nearly a decade later, new data from JWST confirm that Pluto's haze isn't just a visual oddity, it also controls the dwarf planet's climate. The findings, described in a study published June 2 in the journal Nature Astronomy, suggest similar dynamics may be at play on other haze-shrouded worlds in our solar system, and even offer clues about our own planet's early climate. The idea that this haze could control Pluto's climate was first proposed in 2017. Computer models suggested these particles absorb sunlight during the day and release it back into space as infrared energy at night, cooling the atmosphere much more efficiently than gases alone. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. One major challenge was Pluto's large moon, Charon, which orbits the frigid planet so closely that their thermal signals often overlap in telescope data. "Basically, we couldn't know what part of the signal is due to Charon and what part is due to Pluto's haze," Bertrand said. That opportunity arrived in 2022, when JWST's powerful infrared instruments were finally able to separate the two worlds' signals. —James Webb telescope unveils largest-ever map of the universe, spanning over 13 billion years —Pluto's huge white 'heart' has a surprisingly violent origin, new study suggests These findings also open up the possibility that similar haze-driven climates might exist on other hazy worlds, such as Neptune's moon Triton or Saturn's moon Titan, Bertrand said. Even Earth's distant past might bear a resemblance, the researchers said. Before oxygen transformed our planet's skies, it's possible that Earth was veiled in a haze of organic particles — a blanket that may have helped stabilize temperatures and foster early life. "By studying Pluto's haze and chemistry, we might get new insights into the conditions that made early Earth habitable," Zhang said in the statement.

Joseph Gutheinz, a retired senior special agent with NASA's Office of Inspector General and current criminal defense attorney, discussed the existence of UFOs with Fox News Digital. In an era captivated by unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and government conspiracies, one former NASA official is cutting through the noise and casting doubt on aliens coming to Earth. Joseph Gutheinz, a retired senior special agent with NASA's Office of Inspector General and current criminal defense attorney, said it's time to apply science, not speculation, to the debate. Honestly, prove it," he said to those who believe in the presence of UFOs on Earth. And, you know, Area 51 supposedly houses UFOs," he told Fox News Digital. The Pentagon has released videos showing "unidentified aerial phenomena." Gutheinz said that during his work with the NASA Office of Inspector General, he would regularly get calls from individuals who believed they were abducted, or had a chip in their brain from aliens. "What I used to tell my students was the possibility of anybody coming from another world to visit us was beyond unlikely," he said. "And what I would tell the people that would call me up with these tales about being visited by aliens, see a psychiatrist." Citing astronomical distances and scientific understanding of the solar system, Gutheinz explained the improbability of any extraterrestrial visitors reaching Earth. "There are up to 400 billion stars in the Milky Way. There are maybe one to two trillion galaxies in the universe. And if somebody started flying to Proxima and Satori, or the other way around, it would take them over 70,000 years to get there," he said. North America, USA, Nevada, Crystal Springs, Basin And Range National Monument, Area 51 Sign. He pointed to moons like Europa, Ganymede, Titan, and Triton as the only plausible places for primitive life in our solar system. "If there is life on any of those moons, it's possible. When asked whether such sightings could be explained as natural or spiritual phenomena, he suggested that it could be government testing. "If you're seeing something up there, and it's real, it's coming from the Chinese or the Russians or your next-door neighbor flying around with their drone," he said. A NASA logo is displayed at the entrance to the Mary W. Jackson NASA Headquarters building on June 2, 2025 in Washington, DC. Historical military secrecy, Gutheinz suggested, may have played a major role in fostering the UFO myths. "I believe early on in the 1940s when all these UFO stories started coming up, it was because the military was probably testing some aircraft, and they didn't want the Russians to know about it," he said. "And so, if the UFO cover worked, and I would not be surprised if there are some people in the military and the government that played along with that in order to conceal our stealth technology, that is really remarkable, and they just don't want to share that with other countries." Fox News Digital has reached out to NASA for comment. Since joining in 2021, she's covered high-stakes criminal justice—from the Menendez brothers' resentencing, where Judge Jesic slashed their life-without-parole terms to 50-years-to-life (making them parole-eligible), to the assassination attempts on President Donald Trump's life and shifting immigration enforcement, including her reporting on South Florida's illegal-immigration crisis, covering unprecedented migrant crossings from the Bahamas and ensuing enforcement operations. Beyond those beats, she reports on crime, politics, business, lifestyle, world news, and more—delivering both breaking updates and in-depth analysis across Fox News Digital.
