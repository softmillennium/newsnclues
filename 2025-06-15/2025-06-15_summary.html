Amid heightened global economic uncertainty and rising geopolitical risks, global supply chains and trade patterns are undergoing long-term structural shifts. To help mid-sized corporates navigate these changes, Citi Commercial Bank Taiwan recently hosted two client forums, bringing together Citi experts and cross-border trade specialists to share the latest insights and practical strategies. The events drew nearly 200 corporate representatives and were met with strong engagement.

Adrienne Lui, Citi Taiwan Economist, noted that despite elevated global uncertainties, Taiwan's strong competitiveness in the AI and semiconductor supply chains positions its corporates well to adapt to shifting trade dynamics and evolving global supply chain structures. She emphasized that regardless of future geopolitical developments, markets such as ASEAN, Mexico, and the EU remain key destinations for Taiwanese companies and reposition their international footprint — due to cost advantages, and regional trade frameworks.

Supported by robust demand for AI and emerging technologies, Taiwan's exports to ASEAN and the US reached new monthly highs. According to statistics, in April, Taiwan's exports to ASEAN totaled US$10.46 billion, a 60.2 percent year-on-year increase. Notably, exports to Malaysia surged nearly 116 percent between January and April, making Malaysia Taiwan's third-largest export market after China/Hong Kong and the US — a shift largely attributed to supply chain realignment and production adjustments. In addition, in February, Taiwan's exports to the US exceeded those to China for the first time.

The Citi Commercial Bank Taiwan forums featured expert insights from Adrienne Lui and Catherine Simmons, head of Government Affairs for Japan, Australia, North Asia, and South Asia, who provided in-depth analysis on global economic trends and geopolitical developments. Citi's cross-border solutions team also shared insights on how the bank's services can help mid-sized corporates navigate uncertainty and turn emerging challenges into opportunities.

“In today's highly uncertain market environment and rapidly evolving investment landscape, Citi provides clients with timely market insights and geopolitical perspectives to support strategic decision-making and comprehensive financial solutions for cross-border investment and operational needs. As a global bank, Citi is committed to helping our clients adapt their business models and strategies to fast-changing geopolitical and trade dynamics,” said Michelle Yu, head of Citi Commercial Bank Taiwan.

Lui mentioned the increasing volatility in the global landscape and the pressures arising from shifting capital flows, which are driving corporates to accelerate supply chain restructuring. She further highlighted ASEAN's advantages — including regional trade agreements and market potential — positioning it as the most attractive destination for “China+1” and “China+N” supply chain strategies among international and Taiwanese corporates. She remains positive on Taiwan's economic outlook, supported by AI-driven industrial upgrades and solid GDP growth momentum. Taiwan's competitiveness in AI and semiconductor supply chains provides a strong foundation for navigating trade negotiations and global supply chain adjustments.

Lui emphasized that ASEAN, the USMCA, and the EU markets remain key priorities in Taiwanese companies' global strategies. Beyond these regional frameworks, strengthening trade cooperation with other markets, accelerating de-risking efforts, and pursuing diversified market strategies are necessary considerations for Taiwanese companies seeking to further mitigate risk, enhance competitiveness, and adapt to the evolving global trade system.

As geopolitical tensions and evolving economic policies create new and uncharted territory for countries and companies, Citi's global network is a competitive advantage, and our product depth in managing risk and hedging in global markets is unmatched. Citi has been navigating all types of market environments for our clients for more than 200 years and have built a strategy based on a diversified business mix. With a physical presence in more than 90 markets, and a network serving clients in more than 180 countries and jurisdictions, we are uniquely positioned to support our cross-border clients who are at the heart of our strategy and who will need our support as they adapt to this new world order.


SEASONAL WEAKNESS:
                                        The combined revenue of the top 10 foundries fell 5.4%, but rush orders and China's subsidies partially offset slowing demand                                        Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC, 台積電) further solidified its dominance in the global wafer foundry business in the first quarter of this year, remaining far ahead of its closest rival, Samsung Electronics Co, TrendForce Corp (集邦科技) said yesterday.
TSMC posted US$25.52 billion in sales in the January-to-March period, down 5 percent from the previous quarter, but its market share rose from 67.1 percent the previous quarter to 67.6 percent, TrendForce said in a report.
While smartphone-related wafer shipments declined in the first quarter due to seasonal factors, solid demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) devices and urgent TV-related orders                                    



                                                                                Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC, 台積電) and the University of Tokyo (UTokyo) yesterday announced the launch of the TSMC-UTokyo Lab to promote advanced semiconductor research, education and talent development.
The lab is TSMC's first laboratory collaboration with a university outside Taiwan, the company said in a statement.
The lab would leverage “the extensive knowledge, experience, and creativity” of both institutions, the company said.
It is located in the Asano Section of UTokyo's Hongo, Tokyo, campus and would be managed by UTokyo faculty, guided by directors from UTokyo and TSMC, the company said.
TSMC began working with UTokyo in 2019, resulting in 21 research projects,                                    



                                                                                Quanta Computer Inc (廣達) chairman Barry Lam (林百里) yesterday expressed a downbeat view about the prospects of humanoid robots, given high manufacturing costs and a lack of target customers.
Despite rising demand and high expectations for humanoid robots, high research-and-development costs and uncertain profitability remain major concerns, Lam told reporters following the company's annual shareholders' meeting in Taoyuan.
“Since it seems a bit unworthy to use such high-cost robots to do household chores, I believe robots designed for specific purposes would be more valuable and present a better business opportunity,” Lam said
Instead of investing in humanoid robots, Quanta has opted to invest                                    


EXPANSION: 
                                        While Gigabyte Technology is optimistic about market demand this year, uncertainty remains due to the impact of potential US tariffs and currency fluctuations                                        Motherboard and graphics card maker Gigabyte Technology Co (技嘉) yesterday said that it plans to launch an artificial intelligence (AI) server assembly line in the US in the second half of this year.
The company's core motherboard and graphics card businesses in the US remain stable, but sales of its higher-priced AI servers still hinge on the development of tariff policies, Gigabyte chairman  Dandy Yeh (葉培城) told reporters following the company's annual shareholders' meeting in Taipei.
Yeh was referring to the “reciprocal” tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump on April 2, which were later postponed for 90 days.

Iranian missiles evade Israeli air defences to hit refinery and apartment block south of Tel Aviv

Middle East crisis – live updates

Israel attacked Iran's energy industry and defence ministry on the third day of an escalating conflict, as several Iranian missiles evaded Israeli air defences to hit a refinery and rip through a high-rise apartment block south of Tel Aviv.

As fuel depots outside Tehran blazed, Donald Trump presided over the US's biggest military parade in decades. He later said the arsenal on display could be deployed against Iran if it targeted American assets.

The US president said in a social media post: “If we are attacked in any way shape or form by Iran, the full strength and might of the U.S. Armed Forces will come down on you at levels never seen before.”

There is little question that Israel would like the US to join its campaign. Only American weapons can attempt to reach parts of the Iranian nuclear project such as the Fordow uranium enrichment plant, which is buried deep under a mountain.

But while Iran has called off talks with the US on the future of its nuclear programme, and accused Washington of being Israel's “partner” in the offensive launched on Friday, it has held off attacking US bases, embassies or other targets.

With most of its top military echelon assassinated, Israel claiming domination of Iranian airspace from western Iran to Tehran, and several key nuclear sites seriously damaged, the regime in Tehran faces a potentially existential threat.

Perhaps in an appeal to Trump's promotion of himself as the ultimate dealmaker, and his election pitch that he would end America's decades of overseas wars, Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, signalled that Iran was open to attempts to de-escalate.

If Israeli strikes on Iran stopped, “our responses will also stop”, he said. Trump had earlier posted: “We can easily get a deal done between Iran and Israel, and end this bloody conflict!!!”

The US is already trying to promote an exchange of messages with Iran to “calm tensions” with Israel, although the effort falls short of formal mediation, the Haaretz newspaper reported quoting foreign sources.

Trump has spoken about the war with Iranian ally Vladimir Putin, and the emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, who has been in direct contact with the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, since Friday.

G7 leaders flying to Canada for a summit that starts on Sunday are likely to try to use their time with the US president to argue against escalation.

Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, called the leader of Oman, Sultan Haitham bin Tariq al-Said, who had been due to host US-Iran talks, a government spokesperson said. They discussed the importance of halting the conflict and stopping Iran getting nuclear weapons.

For Israel, Saturday night was the bloodiest of the conflict, despite its success in knocking out much of Iran's military hierarchy and parts of its missile systems over the previous day.

Ten people were killed by Iranian strikes on residential buildings, including at least three children, and more than 200 people were injured. Rescuers spent Sunday searching for at least four people missing in the rubble of an apartment block in Bat Yam south of Tel Aviv.

An Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that even advanced air defences could not stop every missile when Iran launched large barrages, as it did on Saturday night.

“In these amounts, of hundreds of projectiles, sadly there will be hits,” the official said. “Even the greatest aerial defence system doesn't get to 100%.”

Benjamin Netanyahu visited the site of the strike on Sunday to see the damage and meet rescue workers. The Israeli prime minister said: “Iran will pay a very heavy price for the premeditated murder of civilians, women and children.”

Israeli attacks on Iran have killed dozens of civilians since Friday, including at least 30 children who died when a missile brought down a high-rise apartment building in Tehran on Saturday. Israel's military says it does not intentionally target civilians.

Iran deployed about 70 missiles overnight, and dozens of drones, although Israel has a higher success rate intercepting those slower-moving projectiles. Over two nights, Iran fired more than 200 missiles at Israel, the official said, and between 20 and 24 of them evaded air defences.

One of those appeared to target a refinery in the northern city of Haifa. In a statement to the Tel Aviv stock exchange, Bazan group said there were no injuries at its plant but pipelines and transmission lines were damaged forcing some facilities to shut down.

Netanyahu said he ordered the pre-emptive operation because Iranian progress towards developing nuclear weapons posed a critical security threat.

After taking out the top of the military hierarchy and vital nuclear scientists, as well as striking key parts of the nuclear programme, Israel appears to be widening its campaign.

It hit energy facilities overnight including an oil depot near Tehran that blazed through the night and a refinery in Bushehr province on the Gulf, and has told people living near arms factories in Iran to evacuate their homes.

An Israeli military official said in the coming days there would be more attacks on “dual use” facilities, and strikes to prevent Iran expanding its stockpile of missiles, estimated to stand at about 2,000 before Friday.

Russia deliberately targeted a building used by the U.S. aerospace and defense giant Boeing in a recent attack on Kyiv,  the Financial Times reported on June 15. Overnight on June 9-10, Russian forces launched hundreds of drones and seven missiles in one of the biggest attacks on Ukraine, damaging buildings across the capital. One of the targets included Boeing's office, according to two Boeing employees, three Ukrainian officials, and the head of the American Chamber of Commerce (ACC) in Ukraine, whom the FT spoke with. "This is not just an attack against Ukraine, but also an attack where American business is being hit," Andy Hunder, President of the ACC in Ukraine, which represents nearly 700 U.S. and international investors and corporate members, told the Kyiv Independent. "This is a war against a world where American businesses are making money and thriving," he added. The strikes on Kyiv came after Ukraine surprised Russia with Operation Spiderweb that saw hundreds of drones target four airbases in Russia and damage 41 war planes. Moscow promised to retaliate in response.  Boeing, one of the largest American companies operating in Ukraine, cooperates with the Ukrainian aerospace and defense company Antonov, with the two companies exploring several joint ventures and opportunities, including in defense. 

Boeing told the FT that none of its employees were injured in the attack and that it continues to operate in Ukraine, where it employs some 1,000 people. Antonov has also suffered from Russian strikes, as have other defense production sites. As Ukraine pushes for domestic defense production instead of relying on foreign imports, Ukrainian officials say that Moscow is attempting to hinder Ukraine's efforts to manufacture arms. German defense company Rheinmetall opened up a factory in Ukraine last October to produce a batch of Lynx infantry fighting vehicles. Moscow threatened the company, saying it was a legitimate target, although Rheinmetall said its facilities are well protected. Russia has repeatedly targeted other Western businesses. Nearly half of the ACC's members have had facilities damaged or destroyed, but 90% still continue to operate in Ukraine, Hunder said. "The American business community is here, it continues to operate, and it's united," he added.

            Fear has been gripping Iranians as Israel vows to continue attacking the Islamic Republic over its nuclear program, with many fleeing the bigger cities, including the capital Tehran, in search of safer areas.
    


            A resident of Saadat Abad, a wealthy neighborhood in north Tehran which has been hit in Israel's strikes, told CNN they heard explosions all night, some so powerful that it shook their entire apartment building. Like other people in Iran who spoke with CNN, the resident asked to remain anonymous out of concern for their safety.
    


            There was chaos as residents ran down to the ground level after smelling smoke from a nearby building that had also been targeted, the resident said. Families with young children struggled to keep them calm.
    


            Unlike Israel, Iran's capital Tehran doesn't have modern bomb shelters, so the city must make use of tunnels, basements or older shelters used in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s – the last time the country faced such a grave national emergency.
    


            “In Tehran there weren't any shelters, people went into basements,” the chairman of Tehran's City Council, Mehdi Chamran, told reporters Sunday, adding that the metro can be used as a shelter “in extreme crisis” but that “we would need to shut the system down.”
    


            The metro in Tehran will be open 24 hours a day starting Sunday night for people to shelter, a government spokesperson announced. Schools and mosques will also be open, she said.
    


            Older people in the building in Saadat Abad were comparing the fear-filled atmosphere to the eight-year-long war with Iraq, which saw Iraqi armed forces invading western Iran along the countries' joint border, the resident said.

Israel ‘not pausing for a moment' as fresh blasts rock Tehran



            Iranian experts have said that by attacking residential areas in Iran, Israel has “crossed the Rubicon” – or passed the point of no return – and is inviting attacks of the same kind from Tehran.
    


            “We don't support the Iranian regime, but we are against Israel attacking residential areas and civilians,” said an older male Tehran resident. “If Israel is against Iran's nuclear program and military capabilities, they should target those areas and not create another situation like what is happening in Gaza.”
    


            Israel has destroyed swathes of the Palestinian territory and displaced almost all of Gaza's population in its war against Hamas, an Iranian ally.
    


            For those still in Tehran, daily life carries on for now despite fears of a widening war. Shelves in grocery stores are stocked and previously arranged gatherings go ahead, but the drumbeat of conflict is never too far off. For those with cars, there are long lines to buy gas and purchases are capped at 25 liters, residents told CNN. Cashpoints are working but at some the amount of cash that can be withdrawn has been limited.
    


            Many of those quitting the capital are heading towards the north, near the Caspian Sea, an area which is more rural and isolated. But residents told CNN that the roads are so gridlocked it is difficult to move.
    


            One family, who didn't want to be named, decided to leave Tehran with their two small children and their elderly parents. They are worried that the government has housed officials and military leaders within highly populated, upper middle-class neighborhoods – putting civilians at risk.
    


            “I don't want to leave my home, but I am not going to put my young children in this position,” the father said. “I hope that the US steps in to stop the attacks between both countries.”

            In the city of Shiraz, in south-central Iran, long lines for gas have been forming around the city. Residents are also stocking up on food, water, and diapers.
    


            Cars full of families with suitcases and water strapped to the roof have been seen around the city, with many families leaving for the countryside.
    


            Meanwhile, nights have become very quiet in Tehran, residents said. Many shops are closed and many people have either left the city or are too scared to go to work, they said.
    


            Israel's operation against Iran is expected to take “weeks, not days” and is moving forward with implicit US approval, according to White House and Israeli officials. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to “strike every site and every target of the Ayatollah's regime,” referring to the country's Supreme Leader.
    


            The Israeli military on Sunday also issued an “urgent” evacuation warning to Iranians living near weapons production facilities, saying being nearby would endanger their lives.
    


            In a rare direct address to the people of Iran, Netanyahu on Friday urged its citizens to “stand up and let your voices be heard,” after Israel unleashed deadly strikes on its regional foe.
    


            “The time has come for the Iranian people to unite around its flag and its historic legacy, by standing up for your freedom from an evil and oppressive regime,” Netanyahu said in a statement.
    


            The Iranian regime remains unpopular at home, where security forces continue their brutal crackdown on dissidents. Nonetheless, the Israeli leader's call fell on deaf ears.

            Many of those with whom CNN spoke did not want to be quoted, even anonymously, but none expressed any support for Netanyahu's calls for a revolt.
    


            “Israel is underestimating our love for our country; the idea that bombing us, our homes, killing our children, would send us to the streets is shocking. We want to live peacefully whether we like the regime or not,” a 36-year-old man who wished to remain anonymous told CNN.
    


            Some Iranians expressed anger and asserted they would never cede to Netanyahu's demands.
    


            “Do I wish the regime wasn't in power? Absolutely. Do I want my city bombed by another dictator? Absolutely not,” Neda, a 28-year-old woman, told CNN.
    


            “Don't let the fake news fool you, the reality of what is happening in Iran as an Iranian who has actually lived in Iran, who has their family in Iran, (is that) Israel is in no way helping our people. I don't need fake news and propaganda speeches,” she added.
    


            Iran has threatened to intensify its own retaliatory attacks if Israel continues hostilities.
    


            Over 200 rocket launches from Iran were reported overnight into Sunday, the Israeli government said, and at least 13 people have been killed in Israel, including three children.
    


            Unofficial tallies published by Iran's state affiliated media said dozens in the country have been killed and injured in Israeli strikes. Iran's authorities have yet to declare a death toll.

The labor actions are built on a decades-long tradition of internationalism, anti-militarism, and anti-imperialism.

On June 4, in response to the unfolding genocide in Gaza, France's CGT dockworkers refused to load arms components bound for Israel at the country's largest port in Fos-Marseille. Their action forced the ship to leave port without its deadly cargo.

Across Europe, dockers carried on the fight. In Genoa, Italian dockworkers pledged to inspect the same vessel and block it if weapons were found. At the Italian ports of Salerno and Scilla, the ship sparked protests. Sophie Binet, the CGT's national secretary-general, called on the French government to immediately halt arms deliveries to Israel.

This was no one-off protest. It built on a decades-long tradition of internationalism, anti-militarism, and anti-imperialism among European dockworkers, including coordinated actions to block weapons to Saudi Arabia in 2019.

As organizers with Workers in Palestine, we support trade unionists around the world who are building solidarity with Palestine. Some of the most powerful actions we've seen in the labor movement globally have come from European dockworkers.

In November 2023 the European Dockworkers Council, an autonomous organization of 14 base-level dockworker unions across 12 countries, organized a coordinated day of action against war and for world peace. That sparked further action: Dockworkers from Barcelona announced they would not handle to arms to Israel. And in October 2024, dockworkers from Greece's Port of Piraeus stopped a shipment carrying arms.

The most sustained action came earlier this year, after 68 percent of Swedish Dockworkers Union members voted to stage a six-day boycott of all military cargo to and from Israel. The boycott was entirely legal, and Sweden's labor courts unanimously upheld it in a preliminary ruling.

Yet on the very day of that legal victory, SDU spokesperson and national deputy chair Erik Helgeson was fired by his employer, Gothenburg RoRo Terminal. His dismissal was a blatant act of retaliation and an attack on workers' right to organize and take meaningful political action.

The Swedish dockers have not backed down. Following a breakdown in contract negotiations, they launched industrial action in May, striking on demands that include stronger protections for union representatives. They are simultaneously pursuing a legal case against the employer and have built a growing campaign across Europe demanding Helgeson's reinstatement.

Dockworkers across Europe have acted in solidarity with the striking Swedish dockers. Belgian dockworkers from the ACV union in Ghent and Zeebrugge refused to handle a ship loaded by strike-breakers from the Swedish city of Gothenburg.

All of this is unfolding against the backdrop of Israel's ongoing attack on Gaza, abetted by the U.S. and other Western governments who continue to provide arms to Israel. Entire communities have been reduced to rubble by Israel's daily bombing. Palestinian trade unionists who remain in Gaza are working tirelessly to keep their communities alive — running soup kitchens, providing mutual aid, and continuing the vital work that trade unions do in times of crisis.

Blockades by dockworkers stand out as one of the most concrete and disruptive forms of solidarity that workers can offer when governments refuse to act. Dockers are showing what it takes to build sustained resistance to war and oppression.

The task ahead is to ensure that such solidarity is not exceptional, but woven into the fabric of our unions so that workers are ready to act not just for one moment, but for the long haul.

            There are few patriarchs within the teen film genre like Mel Horowitz in “Clueless.”
    


            The straight-talking litigator portrayed by Dan Hedaya terrifies everyone in his path – with the exception of his daughter Cher, played by Alicia Silverstone in the beloved 1995 film. He's a man of multitudes. Direct and assertive, yet attentive and loving.
    


            The heavily New York–accented Mel is an outlier to the breezy Beverly Hills setting of the movie. Although “Clueless” is loosely based on Jane Austen's 1815 novel “Emma,” the film's director Amy Heckerling drew on a range of influences outside of Emma's father, the charming Mr. Woodhouse.
    


            “I suppose the main inspiration for Mel was my father – an angry accountant. He was always yelling about one thing or another,” Heckerling recently told CNN over email. “I never seemed to figure out how to diffuse his anger, unless we were driving and I'd stick in a Benny Goodman or Mills Brothers tape.”
    


            Heckerling continued to build Mel, taking cues from detective and gangster archetypes, looking for an actor who would be normally cast in such roles – like “Law & Order” star Jerry Orbach or Quentin Tarantino fixture Harvey Keitel. Both were approached, but prior filming commitments and a strict budget for “Clueless” kept either from landing the role. Hedaya came into the picture via a recommendation from a friend of Heckerling.
    


            “He looked like he could play Bob Shapiro, the famous litigator working on the O.J. trial. I was so happy we were able to get him,” she said of casting the character actor, whose other credits include 1996's “The First Wives Club” and playing Richard Nixon in “Dick” in 1999.
    


            In “Clueless,” although Cher is Mel's only biological child, he opens his home to his college-aged stepson Josh, played by Paul Rudd. Mel “treats him like a son,” according to Heckerling. Studying law, Josh spends an inordinate amount of time at the Horowitz mansion, aiding Mel in his legal cases and referring to him as “dad,” much to Cher's chagrin. But in Mel's words, “You divorce wives, not children.”
    


            While other characters who encounter Mel appear to find him scary, “Cher only sees lovable daddy,” Heckerling observed. Cher possesses the ability to stay positive and calm in the face of her dad's fury, which is something Heckerling learned when dealing with her own father: “If anger is coming at you, it doesn't mean you have to let it in.”
    


            In a touching scene toward the film's climax, Mel lists Cher's personal achievements, mentioning that her organizational skills and caring nature reminds him of Cher's dearly departed mother. Although Mel is seen as tough, he's also fair. His ability to verbalize praise sets him apart from fathers in similar features at the time, such as the overbearing Walter in “10 Things I Hate About You” (Lary Miller), rigid Harlan in “She's All That” (Tim Matheson) and the legacy-obsessed Sam in “Varsity Blues” (Thomas F. Duffy).
    


Just make sure you don't sit in Mel's chair.

Toronto, Vaughan, Brampton, and Calgary have all passed bylaws that infringe on protest rights, and Ottawa may be next.

Montreal, Canada – Civil rights advocates and Palestinian solidarity groups in Canada have raised alarm over a growing wave of municipal bylaws prohibiting protests outside houses of worship, schools, and other sites.

They say the measures — which have been passed in Canada's largest city, Toronto, among other places, and are being considered elsewhere — infringe on freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly.

Activists have also warned that the bylaws are part of a wider push to stifle demonstrations against Israel's genocidal war against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.

“It's clear that this isn't a response to an overall concern around the management of protest,” said Tim McSorley, national coordinator of the International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group, a coalition of dozens of civil society groups in Canada.

Instead, the bylaws are “a response to the overwhelming and unsubstantiated attacks on pro-Palestinian protests across the country,” McSorley told Truthout in an interview. “It's based in anti-Palestinian racism and based in the characterization of those who would protest in favor of Palestinian human rights, against the ongoing genocide, as all being supporters of terrorism, which is clearly not the case.”

On May 22, the Toronto city council passed what has been colloquially referred to as a “bubble zone” bylaw, prohibiting certain rallies within 50 meters (164 feet) of places of worship, schools, child care centers, and other institutions.

The regulation prohibits gatherings that discourage attempts to use the site; “obstruct, hinder or interfere with” access to the site; or “express an objection or disapproval towards any person” based on race, religion, citizenship, or other factors. 

Individuals found to be violating the bylaw — which will come into force on July 2, 2025 — will face a fine of up to $5,000 Canadian ($3,650 USD).

The move followed the passage of similar bylaws in the Toronto-area cities of Vaughan and Brampton, as well as in Calgary in the western province of Alberta. The city council in Ottawa, the Canadian capital, is also considering a similar measure.

The protest was organized there because the synagogue was hosting a real estate event that included homes in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, which are illegal under international law.

And while the Toronto bylaw states that it “does not prohibit peaceful gatherings, protests or demonstrations,” civil rights advocates say unequivocally that the measure — and others like it — aims to stifle demonstrations.

David Mivasair, a rabbi and active member of the group Independent Jewish Voices-Canada, said the wave of Toronto-area bylaws came in response to a large demonstration that was held last year at a local synagogue.

The protest was organized there because the synagogue was hosting a real estate event that included homes in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, which are illegal under international law.

“If car thieves were running a used car sale in the parking lot of a synagogue, and the police knew that's what was going on, they would shut it down immediately. What we had was land thieves selling properties inside a synagogue,” Mivasair told Truthout.

He added that the purported issue that the bylaws are seeking to address — religious-based intimidation targeting people at their houses of worship — is a false problem.

“No one that I'm aware of has ever protested at a house of worship while people are worshipping because they're somehow opposed to people worshipping. That's not what's going on,” he told Truthout in an interview.

Instead, Mivasair said the bylaws “are intentionally designed — engineered — by major Zionist organisations in Canada who want to suppress honest, public discourse about Israel and Palestine” and outlaw Israel-related protests.

Indeed, the demonstration at the synagogue had drawn the ire of pro-Israel lobby groups in Canada, which had been calling for protests to be banned near Jewish community institutions after Israel's Gaza war began in October 2023.

When the City of Vaughan introduced its bylaw to ban protests within 100 meters (328 feet) of “vulnerable social infrastructure” last year, the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs welcomed the move.

“In a democratic and pluralistic society, we should expect to be faced with people we disagree with.”

The center — arguably Canada's most prominent pro-Israel organization — has been pushing for strict enforcement of the bans, saying in December of last year that it was “crucial” for the Toronto bylaw to “have teeth.”

“It must include punitive measures for noncompliance, contain enforcement powers, and, most importantly, it must be enforced,” the group said.

The center has also lobbied for legislation at the federal level that would criminalize what it dubs “dangerous protests” outside institutions.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney appears to be considering a federal prohibition in line with what the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs and other pro-Israel lobby groups have been calling for.

On May 22, Carney wrote in a social media post denouncing the deadly shooting of Israeli embassy workers outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., that his government would “introduce legislation to make it a criminal offence to intentionally and willfully obstruct access to any place of worship, schools and community centres.”

The legislation would also make it “a criminal offence to willfully intimidate or threaten those attending services at these locations,” the prime minister said.

But legal experts say the bylaws violate Canada's constitution, known as the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

The charter outlines four fundamental freedoms in Canada, including freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly. It states that those freedoms can only be limited if such limits “can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.”

“They're trying to shut down the public's right to express disapproval.”

Christine Van Geyn, litigation director at the Canadian Constitution Foundation, said last month that the bylaws fail to meet that test.

“The right to protest is a fundamental right of Canadians. This new bylaw [in Toronto] will prohibit public protests on matters of public interest and will unjustifiably infringe on the right to freedom of expression,” Van Geyn said in a statement.

“While many Canadians disagree with and are upset with some of the protests we have seen in Toronto lately, there is no right not to be offended. In a democratic and pluralistic society, we should expect to be faced with people we disagree with,” she said.

James Turk, director of the Centre for Free Expression at Toronto Metropolitan University, also said the bylaws are unnecessary insomuch as Canada already has laws on the books around illegal behaviour at protests.

“Engaging in violence in Canada, threatening violence, engaging in hate speech as is defined in the Criminal Code and by our courts, obstructing people from going into buildings — are all currently against the law,” Turk told Truthout in an interview.

“A new bylaw is not going to do anything to change that,” he said, adding that in Toronto, the city police service came out against the bylaw by saying it already had the tools necessary to respond to demonstrations.

The solicitor for the City of Toronto also acknowledged that the bylaw would likely face a legal challenge.

According to a confidential report obtained by the Toronto Star, the solicitor had said the city should “narrowly” tailor the bylaw so that it could argue that it limited as much as possible any infringements on the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

But the city council stripped away many of the guardrails the solicitor had proposed, including a requirement for institutions seeking to enforce the bylaw on their property to show that a demonstration had taken place there before when applying for protected site status (i.e., applying to have the bylaw actively enforced at their site).

The text of the bylaw that was passed now only states that the owners of an institution must “reasonably believe” a gathering prohibited under the regulations “may occur” within 50 metres (164 feet) of their property. They can then be approved to apply the bylaw for a one-year period, with option to renew for another year.

“People who were pretty zealous to have a bylaw passed — and it was largely some of the pro-Israeli lobby groups — were able to pressure council enough that they undid most of the narrow provisions” in the earlier draft, Turk said.

He said a legal challenge is likely once the bylaw is applied in practice.

And given the Toronto city council's decision to flout the advice it received from its solicitor, Turk said it will be “much easier to show the court that they were pretty careless with regard to ensuring the protection of constitutional rights in what they've done.”

“I think there's a very good possibility that it will be overturned,” he said. “It pretty clearly, on the face of it, is unconstitutional.”

The experts Truthout spoke with said the wave of bylaws ultimately aim to stifle public debate and dissent.

McSorley at the International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group said the measures must be seen as part of a wider pushback against “language and opinions and actions … that disturb, which offend, and which make people feel uncomfortable.”

“It's not something that we can legislate out of existence,” he said.

“If we bring in laws banning protests outside of certain areas, it sets a precedent. The worry would be that this makes it easier to then bring in other laws restricting protests, or expanding what kind of institutions would fall under these kinds of exclusions.”

Turk at the Centre for Free Expression also explained that freedom of peaceful assembly includes all sorts of disruptive behaviour — short of violence or advocating violence — since “the very nature of assembly is to draw public attention to an issue.”

“They're trying to shut down the public's right to express disapproval,” Turk said about the proponents of the bylaws.

“At the heart of it, this is about restricting public debate and protest in a democratic society,” he added. “The only purpose of this is to take away the public's right to debate and protest and speak publicly about issues that others in the community don't want to hear protests about.”

Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) ignited an electrical substation during a sabotage operation in the Russian city of Kaliningrad, causing $5 million in damage and cutting electricity to a military production site, a source in HUR told the Kyiv Independent. In the early hours of June 14, Ukrainian agents drained the coolant from the substation's power transformer before setting the facility on fire. The inferno inflicted major damage on the facility and caused a power cut, impacting nearby Russian military sites. "We once again remind you that Russia no longer has a rear either in the east, in the west, or anywhere else on the planet. Everything Russian involved in the war against Ukraine will burn, sink, and be destroyed regardless of its level of protection or location," the source said.

Ukraine continues to carry out numerous secretive attacks within Russia and occupied Ukrainian territories, targeting military sites, like airfields, as well as key infrastructure like railways and oil refineries. 

The attacks involve HUR, Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) as well as partisan and sabotage groups. HUR was behind explosions near Desantnaya Bay in Russia's far eastern Vladivostok on May 30, which reportedly damaged military personnel and equipment. The operations took place approximately 6,800 kilometres from the Ukrainian border, making it Ukraine's furthest incursion into Russian territory, if confirmed. On June 1, the SBU launched Operation Spiderweb, a game-changing drone attack on four key Russian military airfields, damaging 41 planes, including heavy bombers and rare A-50 spy planes.

Former French president loses country's highest state award despite Emmanuel Macron's opposition to move

The former French president Nicolas Sarkozy has been stripped of his Legion of Honour, the country's highest distinction, after his conviction for corruption was confirmed last year, according to an official decree published on Sunday.

The conservative one-term president has been beset by legal problems since leaving office in 2012. In December France's highest court upheld his conviction for influence peddling and corruption, ordering him to wear an electronic ankle tag for 12 months.

Sarkozy, who remains an important figure in French politics, had been found guilty by a lower court in 2021 of trying to bribe a judge and peddling influence in exchange for confidential information about an investigation into his 2007 campaign finances.

Sarkozy, whose electronic tag was removed this month, has taken the case to the European court of human rights for appeal. His lawyer, Patrice Spinosi, said he had taken note of the award's revocation but stressed that the appeal was still pending.

An eventual ECHR ruling against France would “imply reviewing the criminal conviction against [Sarkozy], as well as his exclusion from the order of the Legion of Honour”, Spinosi said on Sunday.

Emmanuel Macron argued against the decision, but the rules of France's top state award stipulate that any recipient definitively sentenced to a term in prison equal to or greater than a year will be excluded from the order.

The French president, who is known to meet Sarkozy regularly, had argued that his predecessor had been elected to the country's highest office and it was “very important that former presidents are respected”.

The only previous former president to have had his Legion of Honour revoked was the Nazi collaborator Philippe Pétain, the head of France's wartime Vichy regime, who was convicted in August 1945 of high treason and conspiring with the enemy.

Others to have been stripped of the honour include the former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, the seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong, who was found to have used performance-enhancing drugs, and the film producer Harvey Weinstein, convicted of sexual abuse against women.

Sarkozy's legal woes are not yet over. He has been convicted of illegal campaign financing in his failed 2012 re-election bid, and is currently on trial on charges of accepting illegal campaign financing from the late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.

The court is expected to deliver its verdict in the latter case in September, and prosecutors have asked for a seven-year prison term. Sarkozy denies the charges.

For Europe, North America and Japan, security is back. Energy security, especially. 

This has become a decade of disruption for energy, especially for natural gas. We saw in the early days of the Ukraine war how Russia weaponized gas, signalling what aggression can do to markets. The enormous U.S. build-out of liquefied natural gas has created different distortions for a global gas market that is still evolving. And there's an ongoing debate about the viability and structure of decarbonized gas markets and the role of gas in climate change. If gas is a bridge fuel to renewables, how long is that bridge?

Renewed conflict in the Middle East is adding to that insecurity, particularly as gas-rich Qatar, directly across the Persian Gulf from Iran, accounts for nearly 20 per cent of global LNG exports, and is aiming to double production by 2040.

As the G7 host, Canada is uniquely positioned to help resolve those challenges and set a new course for energy security, global stability, climate action – and the role of natural gas in all three.

Canada to seek agreements in global peace, energy security and new partnerships at G7, Carney says

Natural gas is already among the world's most strategically important energy sources, meeting roughly a quarter of today's needs, and is widely seen as a critical source to power a global population of 9.2 billion by 2040, along with the energy-intensive needs of heavy manufacturing – think reshoring of entire industries – and even hungrier artificial intelligence projects.

Most energy forecasts suggest that in 2040 the world will require more gas, but how much? And what will be the economic and climate consequences?

To map out different pathways, RBC joined forces with Oslo-based Rystad Energy and a group of international researchers in modelling scenarios based on geopolitical forces, policy choices and economic conditions. In one of our scenarios – we call it “Dystopian” because it features shattered international co-operation and unmanaged energy demand – we found the world would need twice as much gas as it produces today. In contrast, another scenario, “Decarbonized,” plays out with rapid decarbonization, where world demand for gas shrinks by roughly a third from today. 

The difference between those outcomes could be roughly 370 million tonnes a year of gas, the equivalent of today's entire production capacity. 

Such uncertainty risks volatile prices, uneven investment in both new and abated gas and insecurity for consumers and producers alike. 

Opinion: Britain needs energy. Canada has energy. Why can't we work together and dream big?

The G7 can address that, as it represents some of the world's biggest producers (the U.S. and Canada) and consumers (Europe and Japan). However, its members are not aligned on gas's role. Canada and the U.S. need long-term contract security to build up infrastructure and strategic supply. Consumers such as France, Japan and Britain want contract flexibility and diversified energy sources such as hydrogen, nuclear and abated natural gas to hedge their risks and meet climate targets. 

As for developing countries, they don't have access to sufficient capital to build out the infrastructure needed to import, regasify, store and distribute LNG. And much of the world is still divided over the climate consequences of gas production and use, in particular the management of its methane emissions.

A concrete strategy for governments and industry begins with a G7 declaration of support for natural gas as an essential bridge fuel to a lower emissions economy, with clear timelines for the transition to a decarbonized gas market built around clean hydrogen, ammonia, methane abatement and the electrification of LNG production. 

The G7 can further throw its weight behind the need to help fast-growing developing countries, especially in Asia and the Global South, as they seek financing and technologies to help switch from coal to gas to renewable energy sources. All of this must be anchored by stronger and more rapid monitoring, accounting and action on flaring, venting and fugitive emissions abatement.

This is not just about the G7. Other democratic allies – Australia and South Korea, in particular, but India, Mexico and a range of South American countries, too – can get behind a new approach to global gas that meets economic ambitions, energy security needs and meaningful climate ambitions. 

Without such conviction, the world risks a future marked by energy insecurity for consumers and producers alike. In short, something like the dysfunctional decade that gave rise to the G7 in the first place.

The corporate, political and tech bigwigs meeting in Sweden are worried about an ‘authoritarian axis' – maybe AI drones will fix things?

Deep within the glittering bowels of Stockholm's fanciest hotel, grave ruminations on the future of the world are taking place.

A heady throng of tech billionaires, ministers, corporate titans and the king of the Netherlands have convened in Sweden for the 71st Bilderberg meeting – the publicity-shy annual policy conference that has long sustained conspiracy theorists – hosted this year by the fabulously wealthy Wallenberg family.

The four days of transatlantic talks are taking place at the swanky Grand hotel, which is owned, like so much else in Sweden, by the Wallenbergs. The Swedish PM, Ulf Kristersson, turned up for welcome dinner on Thursday evening, and would have been about halfway through his second plate of meatballs when the first of Israel's rockets dropped on Tehran.

What better time for the prospects of world war three to go up a gear than in the middle of a Bilderberg conflab, with nuclear proliferation slated for discussion, and the heads of Nato and MI6, and two of America's most senior military officers in the room. They're joined in Stockholm by the CEOs of several major defence suppliers such as Palantir, Thales and Anduril. Even the quietly spoken host of the conference, Marcus Wallenberg, happens to run an arms company. He's chair of Sweden's largest defence contractor, Saab.

The Tehran attacks slot happily into the conference agenda, which includes the topics “Middle East” and the rise of an “authoritarian axis” – what Bilderberg insider Nadia Schadlow, a former deputy US national security adviser, describes as “the growing collusion among revisionist powers”.

According to Schadlow: “An authoritarian axis is rapidly coalescing around China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, disrupting the belief that an international community has taken shape in the aftermath of the cold war.”

Earlier this year, the Economist magazine, whose editor sits alongside Schadlow on Bilderberg's steering committee, struck a similar note, declaring: “The rupture of the post-1945 order is gaining pace.” But the Economist handed Donald Trump a fair chunk of the blame for “junking the transatlantic alliance”.

What this means for Bilderberg is that seven decades of hard work nurturing the postwar international order are in danger of going up in – literal – smoke.

Trump's vice-president, JD Vance, has taken every opportunity to lever the US and Europe apart. “Europe being more independent”, he said recently, “is good for the United States.” Back last summer, before the election, he said: “The United States has to focus more on east Asia. That is going to be the future of US foreign policy for the next 40 years, and Europe has to wake up to that fact.” The presence in Stockholm of Samuel Paparo, the head of the US Indo-Pacific Command, is a sign that Bilderberg has taken this to heart. Also, there's another member of the “authoritarian axis” which looms far larger than Iran over this conference: China.

Though the name “China” doesn't actually appear on this year's agenda, the heightening struggle between America and China is a spectre which haunts at least half of the topics being discussed – from the “geopolitics of energy and critical minerals” to “defence innovation and resilience”.

Just a couple of months ago, Eric Schmidt, the former Google boss and longtime Bilderberg board member, warned that “China is at parity or pulling ahead of the United States in a variety of technologies, notably at the AI frontier”. Schmidt suspects that it will be only a matter of “three to five years” before some form of super-intelligent AI is achieved.

“The geopolitical stakes, especially in the race with China, are enormous,” he says, because attaining super-intelligent AI would mean total and unassailable military domination. In short, it would give the winner “the keys to control the entire world”.

But here's the problem – “due to the immense power requirements of large-scale AI”, beating China to the super-intelligent punch would require “potentially 100 times more energy” than is currently available.

The head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, who is conferencing this year at Bilderberg, recently posted on X that “global electricity demand from data centres powering AI is set to soar in the next decade”.

In this desperate winner-takes-all race for the keys to the world, in which the “geopolitics of energy” becomes ever more important, power stations – along with the data centers they feed – are going to become the No 1 military targets.

Cue the AI drones.

For the time being, before AI invents completely new and unimagined ways for us all to kill each other, drones are perhaps the biggest practical application of AI in warfare. There's a healthy swarm of drone manufacturers at this year's Stockholm summit, sharing their hopes and fears about “defence innovation”.

Hovering alongside Eric Schmidt there's the chairman of Thales – “a leader in the fast growing market of unmanned aircraft systems”. Buzzing nearby is Gundbert Scherf, co-founder of German drone and AI company Helsing. One of the early investors in Helsing is also present: the CEO of Spotify, Daniel Ek, which presumably means that the Helsing drones will have the best playlists, booming out suggested songs as they swoop down to attack.

The investment interlinking of Bilderberg participants is particularly intense around autonomous drone tech. Saab is an investor in Helsing. Helsing is collaborating with leading AI company Mistral, whose CEO is attending the conference. Mistral was funded by Schmidt, who's a huge fan of military UAVs.

Schmidt's recent AI/drone expo, which took place last month in Washington, was co-sponsored by Palantir, which was set up by Bilderberg insider Peter Thiel, who is a major funder of Anduril, whose CEO, Brian Schimpf, is also in Stockholm. Schimpf is a former employee of Palantir, whose CEO, Alex Karp, is also on board of Bilderberg, having been ushered on to it by Thiel. And so it goes.

Thiel's fingers can be found wriggling around in an awful lot of pies, not least the juiciest pie of all: the White House. The two senior White House officials at the Stockholm conference, Kevin Harrington and Michael Kratsios, both used to work for Thiel Capital. And Thiel's famously long list of influential acolytes includes none other than Vance.

Only a few days ago, Vance was on a podcast defending Trump's proposed Palantir-powered database on every citizen, which was described by MSNBC as “an unprecedented spy machine that could track Americans”. Vance waved away any such concerns: “I don't believe that Palantir is collecting any information.”

Thank heavens for everyone's freedoms, Palantir is run by self-confessed “classic liberal” Alex Karp. In a recent earnings call, the idiosyncratic CEO said his company was busy “building really great things”, in order “to power the west to its obvious innate superiority”.

Karp throbs with what he calls “productive narcissism” – at Palantir, he insists: “We're proud of our moral stance”. His philosophy, as he sums it up, is this: “If you've done something big and important, you're probably a good person.” Palantir is successful, ipso facto, it's doing good.

As the Economist put it: “Fast approaching is a might-is-right world.” It's a kind of Gordon Gekko morality that would be heartily approved of by Wall Street legend and Bilderberg faithful Henry Kravis of KKR, on whom Gekko was actually based.

Of course, not all the tech luminaries at this year's Bilderberg are thinking in terms of world domination.

Demis Hassabis, the co-founder of DeepMind, turned up in Stockholm with the 2024 Nobel prize for Chemistry in his back pocket and some rather more optimistic rhetoric about AI, which he thinks will usher in an era of “radical abundance”. He thinks of AI as “the cavalry” arriving to save us from ourselves.

He says: “I'd be very worried about society today if I didn't know that something as transformative as AI was coming down the line.”

And Jack Clark, the co-founder of Anthropic, likes to think AI replacing us in every last occupation will help us find new ways of living fulfilling lives. His vision is of a world in which, freed up from our jobs, we'll engage in “creative, fun exercises in getting AIs to build things, or make things, or carry out competitions and games where people can play them with one another”.

Pulling back for a moment from the AI endgame to the world in 2025, there's one rather less jazzy item on the conference agenda worth mentioning – “US economy”.

But even this has everything to do with China. Taking part in the Stockholm summit is Republican congressman Jason Smith, a vocal fan of Trump's “America first” trade policy. Smith has pledged to “continue fighting to combat the economic and national security threat China poses to our great nation”. He's fully aligned with fellow conference goer Robert Lighthizer, an influential economic adviser close to Trump, who told CBS News earlier this year that “China to me is an existential threat to the United States”.

Lighthizer is urging a “strategic decoupling” from Chinese trade, and most importantly, he says: “We should disentangle our technology.”

Here's where Trump's trade vision intersects with not just the long view of Silicon Valley's bullish billionaires, but with the longstanding transatlantic vision of Bilderberg. Thiel recently called for “a very drastic reset with China” and urged other nations to do likewise.And this reset, he thinks, can become “the basis of how we build a stronger western alliance of the free world”.

In other words, look at our success, and join us. Of course, the only thing wrong with this self-fulfilling meritocratic version of western civilization is that if the Chinese succeed in beating the west to the keys of the world, it will mean that they were the good guys after all.

Iran has partially suspended production at the South Pars gas field — the world's largest — after an Israeli airstrike triggered a fire at the site, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported on June 14, according to Reuters. If confirmed, it would mark the first Israeli strike targeting Iran's vital oil and gas infrastructure.

The South Pars field, located offshore in southern Bushehr province, is responsible for the bulk of Iran's gas output. Tehran shares the field with Qatar, which refers to its portion as the North Field. A strike on South Pars represents a significant escalation, coming after oil prices surged 9% on June 13 following Israel's initial wave of attacks, which had not targeted energy infrastructure, Reuters reports. 

Israel launched its air offensive against Iran on June 13, killing commanders and scientists and bombing nuclear sites, in what it described as an effort to prevent Tehran from developing nuclear weapons.

The Iranian oil ministry said the fire caused by the strike has been extinguished. According to Tasnim, the fire broke out in one of four units of Phase 14 at South Pars, halting the production of 12 million cubic meters of gas.

Iran, the world's third-largest gas producer after the United States and Russia, produces around 275 billion cubic meters of gas per year, about 6.5% of global output. 

Due to international sanctions, the country consumes most of this domestically. Qatar, which operates the majority of the shared field with support from global firms such as Exxon and Shell, produces 77 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas annually, supplying both European and Asian markets.

RABAT, June 15. /TASS/. Further aggravation of the situation in the Middle East caused by the standoff between Iran and Israel may lead to a surge in oil prices to $200-300 per barrel, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Iraq Fuad Hussein said in a telephone conversation with German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul.

"Continuation of the conflict in the region and closing of the Strait of Ormuz may lead to serious economic shocks. Oil prices may grow to $200-300 per barrel in case hostilities start. This may result in inflation growth in European countries and complicate the oil export process for producing countries, such as Iraq," Hussein said, cited by the INA news agency.

"Closing of the pass [Strait of Ormuz - TASS] may lead to a loss of approximately five million barrels of oil per day from the Persian Gulf and Iraq that are coming to the oil market," he stressed.

WASHINGTON, June 15. /TASS/. The administration of US President Donald Trump may ban or restrict the entry to the United States for nationals of 36 countries more, The Washington Post said, with internal documents of the US State Department at its disposal.

According to the news outlet, the list of countries, whose citizens may face the ban for receiving US visas or other restrictions, comprise 25 African countries, including Egypt and Djibouti, and countries of Central Asia and the Caribbean region. An office memo on this topic was signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and sent to diplomats responsible for countries in the list.

Trump earlier banned nationals of twelve countries from entering the United States and introduced restrictions for residents of seven other countries. The full ban will be in effect in respect of citizens of Afghanistan, Haiti, Iran, Yemen, Libya, Myanmar, the Republic of Congo, Somalia, Sudan, Chad, Equatorial Guinea and Eritrea. Furthermore, partial restrictions will be in effect against nationals of Burundi, Venezuela, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo and Turkmenistan.

As tanks thundered through Washington DC to the thrashing of heavy metal music, millions turned out across the US in protest.

Donald Trump finally had the military parade he had longed for since the days of his first administration, saluting and pumping his fist at the display of 250 years of the US Army's might.

But if he had hoped the spectacle, which coincided with his 79th birthday, would have seen an outpouring of national pride, then he would have been disappointed.

Organisers of what were dubbed the “No Kings” protests claimed at least one million people headed onto the streets to demonstrate against what critics say are the president's monarchical ambitions.

And earlier on Saturday, a Democrat lawmaker and her husband were shot in Minnesota in what governor Tim Walz called a “targeted political assassination”.

Storm clouds had gathered over the US – quite literally. The turn in the weather was so bad it stopped a flyover by F-22s, the most advanced fighter jets in the world, which had been trialled for weeks in advance.

The grand military parade that Mr Trump had been wanting for years barrelled down the streets of DC with tanks, troops and a 21-gun salute.

Mr Trump sat on a special viewing stand south of the White House to watch the display of American military prowess.

Crowds cheered and chanted “USA, USA” as the president and Melania Trump, the First Lady, appeared in the stands.

People did whatever they could to get a view. Standing on concrete pillars, climbing barricades and even opting for the tallest pair of shoulders they could find.

The procession, with more than 6,000 soldiers and 128 Army tanks, managed to avoid the looming threat of a thunderstorm, getting away with only a light drizzle.

Above the streets, the Army's Golden Knights Parachute Team descended from overcast skies toward the reviewing stand.

At times, Mr Trump stood and saluted as troops marched past the reviewing stand.

But attendance appeared to fall far short of early predictions that as many as 200,000 people would attend the festival and parade.

Among the sea of patriots was Tim Pohle, 60, who held a sign mocking the president.

“It's the kind of thing you do in North Korea, or Russia. I don't think this is the right thing for the country to be doing,” he said.

“I just feel I've come to a point where you need to hopefully convince some folks that in the next election, they pick someone who can take the country in another direction.”

The US president smiled as the crowd broke out into a chorus of happy birthday after downplaying suggestions the parade was to commemorate him.

“Every other country celebrates their victories. It's about time America did too,” Mr Trump said.

“The army has forged a legacy of unmatched courage... our soldiers have poured out their blood by the bucketful.

“If you threaten the American people, our soldiers are coming for you.”

Mr Trump has been talking up the strength of the US fighting force amid a looming conflict with Iran, saying that enemies that have challenged it have regretted doing so.

As armoured vehicles rolled through Washington, on the other side of the country, the Marines, whom the president deployed to Los Angeles, were on hand to stop violent protests.

Demonstrations were organised in thousands of towns and cities against the celebration, which critics have likened to a dictatorship.

An estimated million people turned out to march against Saturday's spectacle, organisers claimed.

Aerial photos showed swathes of protests marching through city streets. Some protesters held up Mexican flags, while others bore anti-Trump signs and posters which said “no human is illegal”.

In Los Angeles, pictures showed a huge crowd carrying a balloon bearing a cartoonish resemblance to the president, clad in a nappy.

Dozens of Marines stood shoulder to shoulder in full combat gear beside the National Guard, Homeland Security officers and other law enforcement, as hundreds of protesters facing them jeered in English and Spanish, telling the troops to go home.

The processions come after a week of riots, which saw Mr Trump overrule California governor Gavin Newsom to bring in the National Guard and the Marines to police the unrest.

In Washington DC, there were smaller crowds. Some held signs that included “Where's the due process?” and “No to Trump's fascist military parade” as they marched towards the White House

“No Kings” rallies unfolded in hundreds of cities, designed to counter what organisers said were Mr Trump's plans to feed his ego on his birthday and Flag Day.

Organisers said they picked the name to support democracy and speak out against what they call the authoritarian actions of the Trump administration.

Doug Haynes, a Navy veteran who had voted for Mr Trump, attended the day-long festival to celebrate the Army's birthday, but said the parade “was a little over the top”.

The Army's birthday bash has drawn criticism for its price tag of up to $45 million and the possibility that the lumbering tanks could tear up city streets.

Donning a white shirt embroidered with an American flag the size of his back, Brian Dubuc, 61, had travelled two days to reach the the foot of the monument where he cheered on the president.

“I love the military, I'm very patriotic, from the bottom of my foot to the top of my head,” he said.

“I'm here because I love the military. My dad was in the military,” he added. “It's a tough time right now. There's a lot going on.”

A flyover of military aircraft included World War II-era planes, including a B-25 Mitchell bomber, and Army helicopters flew low over the crowd.

Mounted soldiers from the 1st Cavalry Division made an appearance – horses once played a crucial role in warfare.

Mr Trump swore in 250 new recruits and returning soldiers into service, with soldiers repeating an oath after him.

“Welcome to the United States Army! And have a great life,” he said to them afterwards.

The night ended with a rendition of God Bless the USA by Lee Greenwood and a firework display, which had followed the crowd singing “Happy Birthday” to a beaming Mr Trump.

Read our live blog below for a recap of the full event.

Thanks for following our live coverage of the US Army's birthday parade in Washington, DC. This live blog is now closed.

Lee Greenwood is singing “God Bless the USA”, the song which usually kicks off Donald Trump's rallies.

Donald Trump has been serenaded by the crowd gathered in Washington, DC with a chorus of “Happy Birthday”. The US president turned 79 today, although the administration has insisted today's spectacle was marking the 250th anniversary of the US Army instead.

Donald Trump pays tribute to a series of American military heroes, including Creighton Abrams, the Second World War general.

“The army has forged a legacy of unmatched courage... our soldiers have poured out their blood by the bucketful,” he says.

Mr Trump says it is thanks to American heroes that “America stalls tall, America stands proud, and America stands free - we're the hottest country in the world right now”.

“Liberty got its shield and freedom got its sword” with the founding of the US Army 250 years ago, Donald Trump says.

“Our warriors have shown unrivalled valour on field of valour around the globe... they have marched into the flames and fury of combat, charged up mountains, stormed the beaches, waded through torrents of gunfire,” he continued.

“America's enemies have learned if you threaten the American people our soldiers are coming for you.”

“Our souls are filled with gratitude for every generation of warriors who have worn the uniform of our country all the way back to the very beginning,” Donald Trump says, beginning a speech.

He pays tribute to troops who have made the “supreme sacrifice” and “laid down their lives”.

A concert is now underway after the military parade concluded and Donald Trump delivered the oath of enlistment to soldiers.

Donald Trump, the US president, has led hundreds of soldiers in reciting the oath of enlistment. He is expected to deliver a speech soon, following the conclusion of the parade.

Saturday's “No Kings” demonstrations against Donald Trump's military celebration could be some of the largest in US history.

Organisers said millions took to the streets to protest against the festivities for the US army's 250th anniversary celebration, according to ABC News.

The San Francisco Chronicle reported that experts think the marches could be some of the largest in US history.

Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, has shunned the military parade in Washington for a “No Kings” protest in New York.

“No Kings in America,” he wrote on social media.

No kings in America. pic.twitter.com/5JIoAGwDNY

In a separate post, he said: “I was so proud to be in New York City today supporting Americans making their voice heard at No Kings protests and pushing back on Donald Trump's authoritarian push to rig the economy for his billionaire buddies.”

M1 Abrams tanks are rolling along the streets of DC, accompanied by Bradley Fighting Vehicles and Strykers.

A formidable battle tank, the 70-ton Abrams combines devastating firepower with a heavy composite armour to protect its four-man crew.

Its front is capable of withstanding direct hits from an RPG, although its flank is more vulnerable.

People are doing whatever they can to get a view. Standing on concrete pillars, climbing barricades and even opting for the tallest pair shoulders they can find.

Your 6ft6 hack has so far avoided requests for a seat. But the hundreds of fathers in the crowd have had no such luck.

The children with the best seat in the house? JD Vance's kids, who appear to be losing their minds at the tanks that have just rolled passed.

Some of the flyovers planned for the military parade have been cancelled because of the poor weather, officials told US media.

It is unclear which aircraft they were referring to, but the overcast skies did not stop a Second World War-era B-25 bomber flying over the crowd with a P-51 Mustang at each wingtip.

The 1st Armoured Division, nicknamed “Old Ironsides” is now marching past the viewing platform.

Donald Trump salutes with one hand and pumps his fist as they move along Constitution Ave, led by a flag-bearer.

The division was formed during the Second World War, in 1940, and later took part in some of the largest tank battles in the US Army's history during the Gulf War.

Sherman tanks, famously used by the US and Allies during the Second World War, are now trundling through the US capital.

Each section of the parade corresponds to a period of history, from the American Revolutionary War to the president day. The Shermans were retired by the US in the early 1950s, shortly after the Korean War.

It was preceded by a B-25 bomber, which became famous for conducting bombing raids of Japan.

JD Vance, the vice president, has published a photo of his children watching the military parade as it heads through Washington, DC.

“Quite a view!” he wrote on social media. They appear to be standing behind bulletproof glass.

Quite a view! pic.twitter.com/BoWtLKXZ3X

As the parade gets into swing, more than 6,000 soldiers dressed in uniforms ranging from the Revolutionary War up to the present day are marching along the National Mall.

Since gaining fame for its daring raids during the Second World War, the B-25s have become one of the US' iconic bombers.

The last aircraft was retired in 1960, but it has now returned to the skies one more time for the military parade, flanked by a P-51 Mustang on either side.

When you think of an American patriot, you think of Brian Dubuc. Donning a white shirt embroidered with that an American flag the size of his back, he's here for one thing only; the military.

“I love the military, I'm very patriotic, from the bottom of my foot to the top of my head,” the 61-year old said.

He has travelled a staggering two days with his family to reach the foot of the monument with a perfect view of the stage where Trump will speak tonight.

“I'm here because I love the military. My dad was in the military,” he adds.

“It's a tough time right now. There's a lot going on.”

The thudding of the 21 gun salute is the only thing louder than the cheers for President Trump, who has just arrived at the parade.

Hail to The Chief follows and so does the start of the parade. Soldiers march wearing the dress form every period the army has fought. It's a moving timeline of the army's history.

Uniformed servicemen have begin marching through the streets of Washington DC as the US army's 250th anniversary parade kicks off proper.

Soldiers carrying American flags have joined bands to march along a stretch of the National Mall.

Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, can be seen applauding and smiling, with the President occasionally saluting the soldiers.

Tonight's festivities have kicked off almost half an hour early, with rain forecast later tonight.

Following reports the festivities could be postponed or even cancelled owing to the weather, Donald Trump this morning wrote on Truth Social that the celebration would go ahead “rain or shine”.

Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, took the stage to address crowds at the 250th anniversary parade for the US army.

Crowds cheered and screamed as Mr and Mrs Trump entered, shortly after which a gun salute rang out against a back drop of chants of “USA, USA”.

Chief Musician SSG Caroline Nielson is now performing a rendition of the Star Spangled Banner.

Tim Pohle, 60, is a brave man. Among the sea of patriots, he holds a sign mocking the president. 

He has never protested before. But the military parade proved to be the final straw that drove him to demonstrate. 

“It's the kind of thing you do in North Korea, or Russia. I don't think this is the right thing for the country to be doing,” he said. 

“I just feel I've come to a point where you need to hopefully convince some folks that in the next election, they pick someone who can take the country in another direction.”

We're interrupted by a man who shouts, “Trump is my king”. But he says he's had nothing but friendly interactions. 

“There are some proud boy who walked by me and showed me a gang sign or something threatening, he adds”.

Los Angeles. Just wow. pic.twitter.com/5MNeg2UaVb

Juliana Balogh, 72 and Kim Muygen, 31, who met at a Donald Trump rally, say they're here for a once in a lifetime experience.

Originally from Vietnam, Ms Muygen says the president's pledged to clamp down on illegal immigration is why she voted for him.

“I'm an immigrant from Vietnam and we came here legally. It took a long time to come here and we pay tax. After five years we applied to become citizens,” she said.

Ms Muygen became a US citizen after legally entering the country and living in LA for more than two decades

“I see people just crossing the border and guessing in it's not fair you have to come here legally.”

Everything is bigger in Texas. But my goodness have they given a good go here in Washington.

Hundreds of tanks, thousands of troops and countless more Maga hats fill Washington DC's National Mall.

But it's not the kind of atmosphere you'd perhaps expect from a gathering of such fierce Trump supporters.

It is instead akin to something much more like a family friendly day out.

Ironic of course, given the sheer amount of weaponry on display.

Donald Trump's wife, Melania, is to make an appearance at the festivities later today.

The president is to speak this evening, following a 21 gun salute and “hail to the chief”.

Mrs Trump is understood to potentially be joining her husband onstage.

“No Kings” protesters marched through the streets of Los Angeles following a week of riots over ICE arrests in the city. 

Thousands of protesters could be seen, some carrying Mexican flags, marching through the Southern Californian city's streets.

Critics have drawn parallels between today's display of military mite and the deployment of National Guard troops and Marines on the streets of LA to help police the riots.

Donald Trump has been locked in an on-going row with California's governer Gavin Newsom after the president went over his head to involve the military in the containment of the protests.

A steady stream of protesters is heading past The Telegraph's Washington, DC offices, apparently heading to the White House.

Footage posted on social media shows demonstrators streaming down 14th Street, waving banners that read “The fascist Trump regime must go” and “Trump must go now”.

It raises the prospect of clashes with law enforcement, after Donald Trump vowed anyone who disrupted his military parade would face “very heavy force”.

“No Kings”, a collection of protest groups which is organising demonstrations across the country, deliberately avoided the US capital to avoid confrontations with the authorities.

A spokesperson for the United States Capitol Police (USCP) confirmed they were aware of the violent incident in Minnesota today. 

Melissa Hortman, the Democratic speaker in Minnesota's House of Representatives, along with her husband, was shot by a gunman in their home in the early hours of Saturday.

John Hoffman, a Democratic state senator, and his spouse were also shot multiple times. Both have received surgery and are expected to survive, officials say.

A spokesperson for the USCP told NBC News: “The United States Capitol Police is aware of the violence targeting state lawmakers in Minnesota. We have been working with our federal, state and local partners. For safety reasons, we cannot provide specific details about our security posture.”

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has wished Donald Trump and the US Army a “double happy birthday”.

Me Netanyahu, speaking as Israel strikes Iran in an attempt to derail its nuclear programme, paid tribute to Mr Trump as a “decisive, courageous” leader who had been an“extraordinary friend to the Jewish state and to me personally”.

“We appreciate what you're doing now, helping protect Israeli lives against the criminal regime in Iran,” he said.

Mr Netanyahu added: “I want to wish also a 250th Happy Birthday to the American Army.

“The men and women of the armed services of the United States have protected freedom for two and a half centuries. We would not have a free world without you. Thank you on behalf of free peoples everywhere.”

“No Kings” protest leaflets have been found in the car of a man suspected of shooting dead a Democrat politician and her husband in Minnesota.

Melissa Hortman, the Democratic speaker in Minnesota's House of Representatives, along with her husband, was killed by a gunman in their home in the early hours of Saturday, in what authorities said appeared to be a “politically motivated assassination”.

John Hoffman, a Democratic state senator, and his spouse were also shot multiple times. The pair are expected to survive, officials said.

Minnesota police released an image of dozens of leaflets about the “No Kings” protests, demonstrating against Donald Trump and his military parade, on the seat of a car belonging to the suspect.

“Given the targeted shootings of state lawmakers overnight, we are asking the public to not attend today's planned demonstrations across Minnesota out of an abundance of caution,” they said in a statement.

As US tanks and troops parade through the streets of Washington, DC, protests are expected to take place across the country.

Organisers say the “No Kings” demonstrations, protesting against Donald Trump, will be held in around 2,000 towns and cities across the US - but not the capital, to avoid clashes with law enforcement.

They hope to create a “split-screen” between the displays of military power in Washington contrasted against anti-Trump protests elsewhere.

Donald Trump has insisted the military celebration will go ahead “rain or shine” following a report that the military celebration could be cancelled or rescheduled owing to adverse weather conditions.

A source told The Times that a looming thunderstorm warning for this weekend could be a threat to public safety, and may see the event cancelled.

Residents of America's capital last night also received mobile phone alerts, warning them of flash flooding in the city.

However, Mr Trump this morning wrote on his Truth Social site: “Our great military parade is on, rain or shine. Remember, a rainy day [parade] brings good luck. I'll see you all in DC.”

There are thunderstorms forecast for the weekend, and protesters planning to rain on his military parade, but there's one piece of good news for Donald Trump on his 79th birthday.

Polling shared with The Telegraph shows significant support for the president's deployment of troops to clamp down on riots in Los Angeles, with the public backing his move by a margin of 14 per cent.

Initially, Mr Trump's decision to send the National Guard and US Marines to the city of angels had threatened to cast a cloud over his parade on Saturday, with soldiers detaining US citizens during what was meant to be a shared celebration of the country's military history.

James Johnson, co-founder of JL Partners, which conducted the polling, said it showed the president was “very much winning the battle of public opinion when it comes to the protests”.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Tens of thousands of demonstrators in the Netherlands donned red clothing and marched Sunday to protest the Dutch government's policy toward Israel, exceeding the turnout for a similar event in May. 

Protesters walked a 3-mile (5-kilometer) loop around the center of The Hague to symbolically create the red line they say the government has failed to draw to halt Israel's campaign in Gaza. 

“I don't want to be complicit in these horrendous crimes happening there and I want to speak out,” protester Marin Koning told The Associated Press. 

The human rights groups and aid agencies — including Amnesty International, Save the Children and Doctors Without Borders — that organized the march estimated the peaceful crowd at more than 150,000 people. Local media put the numbers closer to 100,000.

In neighboring Belgium, around 75,000 people, many of them also clad in red, hit the streets in the capital Brussels, police said. Several rallies have been held to draw attention to Israel's actions in Gaza, but Sunday's was the biggest rally so far.

The Dutch protest sent a “clear signal,” according to Marjon Rozema of Amnesty International Netherlands. Dutch officials must “act now, at both the national and international level, to increase the pressure on the Israeli government,” she said in a statement. 

As during the first Red Line protest in May, the march took the crowds past the Peace Palace, headquarters of the United Nations' International Court of Justice, where last year judges ordered Israel to do all it can to prevent death, destruction and any acts of genocide in Gaza.




Israel strongly denies that it is violating international law in Gaza.

The event takes place weeks after the country's ruling four-party coalition collapsed, leaving the Netherlands with a caretaker government when it hosts a summit of NATO leaders at the end of June. 

Hamas started the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, with militants killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking another 251 hostage. The militants still hold 53 hostages, fewer than half of them alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

Israel's military campaign has killed over 55,300 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It says women and children make up most of the dead but doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel says it has killed more than 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.

The European Union's top diplomat, meanwhile, convened an emergency meeting of the 27-nation bloc's foreign ministers on Tuesday to discuss the conflict between Israel and Iran.

The meeting, to be held via video link, “will provide an opportunity for an exchange of views, coordination on diplomatic outreach to Tel Aviv and Tehran, and possible next steps.” EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas's office said Sunday.

“We will continue to contribute to all diplomatic efforts to reduce tensions and to find a lasting solution to the Iranian nuclear issue which can only be through a negotiated deal,” it said.

Live Updates


            • Fresh blasts rock Tehran: Explosions hit residential areas of the Iranian capital as the Iran-Israel conflict intensified. Israel's military said “we don't stop striking for one moment.” Iran launched a daytime barrage against Israel for the first time but there have been no reports of significant damage.
    


            • Israeli toll mounts: At least 14 are confirmed dead in Israel in the hostilities. Visiting the scene of a strike that killed 4 people, Israel's PM Netanyahu said “think what would happen if Iran had atomic weapons.” A stated goal of the Israeli operation is to stop Iran developing a nuclear bomb.
    


            • Iranians flee: Some Tehran residents have been escaping north to safer rural areas while others have been stockpiling essentials. The metro system is open around the clock so people can shelter. Scores are reported killed but no official figure has been given.
    


            • No end in sight: Israel's operation against Iran is expected to take “weeks, not days” and is moving forward with implicit US approval, according to White House and Israeli officials. US President Trump said his country “had nothing to do with” the Israeli attacks but later acknowledged that US involvement in the conflict is a possibility.
    


            Israel's air force has started a series of strikes on dozens of surface-to-surface missiles in western Iran, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Sunday.
    


            “The IAF began a series of strikes on dozens of surface-to-surface missile targets in western Iran,” the IDF's statement read.
    


            The strikes between Iran and Israel continued throughout Sunday. Israel warned citizens across the country to stay near shelters after detecting missiles, while residents in the Iranian capital Tehran told CNN they felt fresh explosions shake the city on Sunday afternoon.
    


            The US Embassy in Baghdad issued a security alert on Sunday warning of an increased potential for violence or attacks against Americans in Iraq.
    


            “The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad is aware of the increased potential for foreign terrorist organization-inspired violence or attacks against U.S. businesses and locations frequented by U.S. citizens,” the security alert said.
    


            The embassy urged US citizens to avoid locations frequented by foreigners and any large gatherings or crowds.
    


            The State Department maintains a Level 4 Travel Advisory for Iraq, meaning Americans should not travel to Iraq for any reason.
    


            An Iranian foreign ministry building was hit in the Sunday afternoon strikes, videos show, in what would be the second confirmed attack on a government site since the latest violence erupted between Israel and Iran.
    


            Footage circulating on social media, and verified by CNN, shows smoke billowing from the library of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, located in northern Tehran.
    


            A second video geolocated by CNN shows heavy smoke near the Ministry of Justice, in western Tehran.
    


            Several residential areas were hit in the latest Israeli strikes, according to witnesses and state media.
    


            A local journalist told CNN that he was near a square in the city when he heard several explosions. He said that the windows of offices near the explosion were all destroyed, and that ambulances had rushed to the scene.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Fox News on Sunday that he launched airstrikes against Iran to prevent “a nuclear holocaust,” claiming his government had intelligence that Iran was months away from developing an initial nuclear weapon.
    


            “We had to act,” Netanyahu told Fox's Bret Baier on Sunday. “It was the 12th hour, and we did act. To save ourselves but also … to protect the world from this incendiary regime.”
    


            “The intel we got and we shared with the United States was absolutely clear: That they were working in a secret plan to weaponize the uranium, they were marching very quickly, they would achieve a test device and possibly an initial device within months, and certainly less than a year,” he said.
    


                    “That is something that we couldn't possibly accept,” he continued. “We will not have a second holocaust, a nuclear holocaust. We already had one, in the previous century – the Jewish state is not going to have the holocaust committed on the Jewish people. It's not going to happen.”
                





            Netanyahu also claimed that Israel saw enough enriched uranium for nine bombs. “All they had to do was weaponize them. We stopped that.”
    


            Asked if regime change was among his objectives in Iran, Netanyahu said: “It could certainly be the result, because the Iran regime is very weak.”
    


            Netanyahu said “80% of the people would throw these theological thugs out.”
    


            “They shoot women because their hair is uncovered. They shoot students. They just suck the oxygen out from these brave and gifted people, the Iranian people.”
    


            “The decision to act, to rise up this time, is the decision of the Iranian people.”
    


            Ukraine's foreign ministry has said five of the victims of an Iranian strike on the central Israeli city of Bat Yam on Sunday were Ukrainian citizens.
    


            “As a result of a massive Iranian missile attack against Israel, and a missile hitting a residential building in Bat Yam, five Ukrainian citizens, including three minor children, were killed,” the foreign ministry said in a statement Sunday, citing preliminary information from the Embassy of Ukraine in Israel.
    


            The death toll from the strike currently stands at seven people.
    


            Ukrainian diplomats are working with Israeli police to identify and repatriate the bodies, the statement detailed.
    


            Israel's military says it has struck “an Iranian aerial refueling aircraft at Mashhad Airport in eastern Iran,” deep in Iran's northeast, in what it claims is the longest-range strike it has conducted since its operation began.
    


            Mashhad International Airport is around 70 miles from Iran's border with Turkmenistan; the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement Sunday it is about  1,430 miles (2,300 kilometers) from Israel.
    


            “The IAF is operating to establish aerial superiority over Iranian airspace. This marks the longest-range strike conducted since the beginning of the operation,” the IDF said in a statement.
    


            President Donald Trump acknowledged that US involvement in the conflict between Israel and Iran is a possibility during a phone interview with ABC News on Sunday.
    


            “We're not involved in it. It's possible we could get involved. But we are not at this moment involved,” Trump told ABC's Rachel Scott.
    


            When asked if there's a deadline for Iran to come to the table, the president said “no,” according to Scott.
    


            “No, there's no deadline, but they are talking. They'd like to make a deal. They're talking. They continue to talk,” Trump said.
    


            The next round of US-Iran nuclear negotiations, scheduled to take place in Oman on Sunday, was canceled. But Trump said the Iranians “want to talk, and they will be talking,” adding that the recent escalations “may have forced a deal to go quicker, actually.”
    


            Trump also expressed a willingness to consider Russian President Vladimir Putin as a potential mediator in the conflict, noting that Putin had reached out to him.
    


            “He is ready. He called me about it. We had a long talk about it,” the president said.
    


            The death toll from Iranian strikes on Israel since Friday has risen to 14, Israel's Government Press Office said Sunday.
    


            Another body was recovered in the city of Bat Yam in central Israel, after an Iranian strike hit a residential building.
    


            At least seven people were killed in that strike, according to emergency services and government officials.
    


            Iran's president has said the United States “undoubtedly plays a direct role” in Israel's military operation, Fars state media agency reported.
    


            The outlet quoted President Masoud Pezeshkian as saying; “[US Special Envoy Steve] Witkoff told [Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas] Araghchi, ‘Israel cannot do anything without our permission' – this means Israel's actions are carried out with direct approval from the United States.”
    


            Pezeshkian continued to claim that “what we are witnessing today is being done with Washington's direct backing, even though they try to conceal their role in the media.”
    


            The president said that while Iran has never sought war or conflict, any continuation of hostilities would be met with “decisive and severe” retaliation.
    


            The administration of US President Donald Trump has not critiqued the weeks-long timeframe in private discussions, an Israeli official told CNN. A White House official said the administration was aware and implicitly supportive of Israel's plans.
    


            Israeli foreign minister Gideon Sa'ar has said his government anticipated casualties in the wake of its audacious assault on Iran, but it “didn't have any other choice.”
    


            “When we took this historic decision, tough decision, we knew we will have difficult times and we will face casualties, but saying that, we didn't have any other choice,” Sa'ar said in an exclusive interview with CNN's Bianna Golodryga on Sunday.
    


            At least 13 people have been confirmed dead in Israel due to Iran's retaliatory strikes, including three minors.
    


            The foreign minister said assessments of Iran's nuclear program showed it could have made an atomic bomb “within six months,” reiterating claims that Iran had enough enriched uranium for nine nuclear bombs.
    


            When asked whether unseating Iran's regime, led by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is one of Israel's goals in this latest conflict, Sa'ar said: “The goal is not a regime change… This is for the Iranian people to decide, we, Israel… don't see the Iranian people as our enemies.”
    


            The foreign minister thanked the United States for their military aid, but added it is up to them as “a sovereign state” to decide whether they would directly assist Israel in eliminating Iran's military facilities. “They have their calculations, and they'll decide,” he said.
    


            Former US Vice President Mike Pence issued a stark warning during an interview Sunday on CNN's State of the Union with Dana Bash as Israel detected more missile launches from Iran.
    


            “Iran will never be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon,” Pence said, when asked by Bash about the ongoing tit-for-tat attacks between the two nations. “And witnessing in the skies just moments ago, you can see the reason why,” Pence continued.
    


            Pence went on to elaborate on the broader dangers of a nuclear-armed Iran and reiterated a hardline stance against Iran's nuclear ambitions.
    


            “Remember, those missiles that Iran has developed over the years can reach Europe, today. They've been working on intercontinental ballistic missiles that could reach the United States, and Iran is the leading state sponsor of terrorism,” the former vice president said.
    


                    “It threatens our allies, threatens people of the United States,” he added.
                





            “During our administration, we made that clear. I'm grateful for President Trump's strong statements of support for Israel and its action,” Pence said reflecting on his time in office, emphasizing the Trump administration's firm position on Iran's nuclear ambitions.
    


            “I want to say emphatically that if the world knows nothing else, the world should know this, America stands with Israel,” Pence said.
    


            But the former vice president also offered a warning to both the current administration and his former boss, after Bash pressed him on Trump's recent comments on his call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
    


            “Vladimir Putin continues his brutal and unprovoked invasion in Ukraine using drones provided by Iran, I would say respectfully to the administration. We ought to be looking elsewhere than Vladimir Putin for advice on how to deal with this situation,” Pence said.
    


            The US and Russian presidents held an hourlong phone call on Saturday, Trump confirmed in a social media post, adding that the leaders spoke about Iran and Israel's tit-for-tat airstrikes “at length,” and called for an end to the conflict.
    


            More details of this afternoon's Israeli strikes on Tehran are beginning to emerge, with densely populated residential areas of the Iranian capital being targeted, CNN understands.
    


            They include three busy intersections in the city: Tajrish and Quds Square, Shariati Avenue and Valiasr Square.
    


            Tajrish is home to a major shopping center, while Valiasr Street is considered one of Tehran's main thoroughfares and commercial centers.
    


            The strike on Quds Square in Tajrish hit 50 meters from Shohada Hospital, a major health center in northern Tehran.
    


            Video footage circulating on social media and geolocated by CNN shows smoke billowing into the sky following a strike in a dense area of the city near Valiasr Street.
    


            Footage taken from Quds Square shows an injured person being carried on a stretcher to a waiting emergency vehicle. The camera pans upwards to show the smashed windows of a nearby building.
    


            Other images show smoke near Tehran's Ministry of Justice building.
    


            Israel's military had previously said it was targeting military and nuclear complexes in Iran, although there are no known such complexes in these areas of the capital.
    


            Another furious wave of strikes between Israel and Iran has claimed lives in both countries, with Israel threatening to continue its attacks “for as long as it takes” to wipe out Iran's nuclear threat.
    


            “Iran will pay a very heavy price for deliberately murdering our citizens, women and children,” Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday. “We will also achieve our objectives and we will also strike them forcefully. They will feel the might of our arm.”
    


            Here's what you need to know.
    


            US President Donald Trump has pledged that Iran and Israel “will make a deal” to pause their conflict, insisting that “many calls and meetings (are) now taking place” to get both sides to halt fighting.
    


            “Iran and Israel should make a deal, and will make a deal, just like I got India and Pakistan to make,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday morning. He also cited the long-running animosity between Serbia and Kosovo, and between Egypt and Ethiopia, both of which flared up during his first term in office.
    


            “Likewise, we will have PEACE, soon, between Israel and Iran! Many calls and meetings now taking place,” Trump wrote.
    


            “I do a lot, and never get credit for anything, but that's OK, the PEOPLE understand. MAKE THE MIDDLE EAST GREAT AGAIN!”
    


            Israeli citizens have been told they can leave their shelters by the Home Front Command, but must remain nearby, after Iran launched its first daytime missile barrage since the latest conflict erupted on Friday.
    


            Israel's national emergency service Magen David Adom (MDA) said there have been no reports of injuries as of yet.
    


            Israel has continued to strike Iran throughout the day on Sunday, with reports of fresh blasts in the capital Tehran.
    


            Israel's military has detected more missiles launched from Iran on Sunday, warning citizens across the country stay near shelters.
    


            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its defensive systems were operating to intercept the threat.
    


                    “The Home Front Command has now instructed residents across the country to remain close to protected spaces. Movement in public areas should be minimized, and public gatherings must be avoided,” the IDF said in a statement.
                





            A CNN team in Tel Aviv reported sirens sounding in the city.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has again warned of the danger of Tehran having nuclear weapons as he visited the impact site of an Iranian missile strike that killed at least four people.
    


                    “We are here because we are in an existential campaign, which is clear today to all citizens of Israel. Think of what could happen if Iran had atomic weapons to drop on Israeli cities. Think of what could happen if Iran had 20,000 such missiles,” Netanyahu said in a video message from the city of Bat Yam. A stated goal of the Israeli operation is to stop Iran developing a nuclear bomb.
                





            “Iran will pay a very heavy price for deliberately murdering our citizens, women and children. We will also achieve our objectives and we will also strike them forcefully. They will feel the might of our arm,” he added.
    


            The Israeli leader urged citizens to adhere to home front command instructions when issued to shelter inside, saying, “It will save your lives.”
    


            The prime minister's visit comes after Israeli President Isaac Herzog attended the impact site to meet emergency responders and residents.
    


            Residents in the capital Tehran told CNN they felt fresh explosions shake the city on Sunday afternoon.
    


            State media reported blasts in several residential areas in the west of the city and showed plumes of smoke rising. One video showed a car on fire and the street thick with dust.
    


            The full extent of the damage or if there are casualties is unclear.
    


            The Israeli military was giving a briefing as reports emerged, with a spokesperson saying further strikes were underway.
    


            “We don't stop striking for one moment,” Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Effie Defrin said. “At this time, too, we continue to strike dozens of various additional targets in Tehran.”
    


This post has been updated. 



            Israel struck the “nuclear command center of the Iranian regime” in overnight strikes on 80 targets across Iran Saturday, a military spokesperson said, adding: “We are not pausing for a moment.”
    


            The new round of strikes on Iran hit “research and development sites used for the production of raw materials and laboratories for the development of nuclear weapons,” Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief Spokesperson Effie Defrin said at a Sunday briefing.
    


            “We also struck fuel depots near Tehran that support Iranian military infrastructure,” he said.
    


            Overall, Israel has struck 250 targets in Iran.
    


            “Even at this hour, we are continuing to strike dozens more targets in Tehran,” Defrin said.
    


            “We are deepening the damage to the nuclear program and to military capabilities, in order to disrupt and reduce the threat to the Israeli home front.”
    


            Israel's President Isaac Herzog visited the site of a deadly Iranian missile strike in Bat Yam, Central Israel, on Sunday.
    


            A residential building was directly struck at around 2.30 a.m. local time Sunday, killing at least four people including a 10-year-old boy.
    


            Dozens were injured, with rescue forces continuing to search for missing people, according to Israel's Government Press Office.
    


                    “Civilians of all ages, all backgrounds- Jews and Muslims, young and old, veteran Israelis and new immigrants, Holocaust survivors and toddlers, were unfortunately, and so sadly, killed by a horrendous Iranian attack against our cities,” Herzog said at the scene, while meeting residents and rescue workers.
                





            The president added that Israel's aim is to “change the reality in the Middle East,” and he called on the leaders of the G7 countries convening in Canada to stand behind Israel, to move the region towards “peace … dialogue… coexistence and rapprochement.”

Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., and Fatima Goss Graves, the CEO of the Women's Law Center, square off during a DOGE hearing on protecting women's sports.

EXCLUSIVE: Two USA Fencing board of directors members are suing the other six at-large director members, alleging chair Damien Lehfeldt made false statements to congress at a May 7 Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) subcommittee hearing on transgender athletes. 

The lawsuit, which seeks to have Lehfeldt removed as USA Fencing chair, was filed on USA Fencing's behalf by the two plaintiff members.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) (R) speak about an alleged screenshot from the Instagram of USA Fencing board director Damien Lehfeldt during the hearing on "Unfair Play: Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports" held by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Subcommittee at the U.S. Capitol on May 7, 2025, in Washington, D.C.  (Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)

The plaintiffs, Andrey Geva and Abdel Salem, each have long ties to the sport and organization. 

Geva is a former U.S. National Coach who led the U.S. Women's Épée Team at the 2016 and 2020 Olympics, before being elected to the board in 2024. Abdel competed for Egypt in individual and team épée events at the 1984 Summer Olympics, the former head fencing coach of the U.S. Air Force Academy, and in 1996 was named the U.S. Olympic Committee Coach of the Year.

Now, they are taking the organization to court after alleging Lefheldt falsely announced Geva's resignation from the board at a meeting on June 7, and over several allegations involving the May 7 Doge hearing.

The May hearing was called in response to a viral incident where women's fencer Stephanie Turner kneeled to protest a transgender opponent, and was subsequently punished by USA Fencing. Lefheldt was the lone figure to testify on behalf of the organization. 

The lawsuit claims Lehfeldt made "false and misleading claims" at the hearing, which now risk the organization being declassified as a national governing body (NGB). 

"Defendant Lehfeldt's non-corporative demeanor in bad faith and untruthful and misleading statements at the congressional hearing on May 7, [2025] has prompted the Congress to consider decertifying USFA as an NGB, thus potentially risking Team USA's qualification in the 2028 Los Angeles Summer Olympic Game," the lawsuit states.

"His lies have alienated thousands of members in the fencing community who have provided more than 90% of USFA's revenues." 

Geva claims he attempted to speak at the hearing as well, but alleges he faced "threats" aimed to "deter" him from it. Geva ultimately submitted a letter to Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on May 2, expressing "opinion on biological men's advantage over women in fencing." Cruz's office had recently opened an investigation into USA Fencing over its transgender eligibility policy after the Turner incident. 

The letter was then referenced during the DOGE hearing by subcommittee chairwoman Marjorie Taylor-Greene. 

"'Transgender women's fencers have significant advantages in women's competitions,' he writes," Greene said during the hearing, reading from Geva's letter. 

The lawsuit alleges Geva was then messaged by a fellow board member, blaming him for his honest personal opinion, and then two board members called for a "special board meeting intended to remove or otherwise discipline Plaintiff Geva."

WHO IS STEPHANIE TURNER? WOMEN'S FENCER WHO KNELT TO PROTEST TRANS OPPONENT AND IGNITED GLOBAL AWARENESS

USA Fencing has acknowledged the lawsuit in a statement to Fox News Digital. 

"USA Fencing proudly serves its members — athletes, coaches, referees and clubs — across our community with absolute transparency and integrity. This derivative lawsuit misrepresents our organization, and we will vigorously defend the organization in court; any attempt to disparage them will be addressed appropriately," the statement read.

"Because litigation is ongoing, we cannot discuss details. Our focus remains unwavering: advancing fencing nationwide, supporting every member's success, and upholding the values of the Olympic and Paralympic movement."

The organization has been under immense national scrutiny following the release of the footage of Turner's protest on April 2. 

Lefheldt's testimony at the May 7 hearing only intensified the criticism. 

Lehfeldt, who was subpoenaed and did not come voluntarily, made elevated the controversy ahead of the hearing with a series of Instagram stories that were later blown up and used against him on the committee floor. In one post, which went viral before the hearing, he responded to a question that asked whether he was "okay" with putting female fencers at a disadvantage with a simple, brash answer: "Yeah." 

Then, during the hearing, Lehfeldt admitted multiple times he regretted answering that way and admitted the question required a "more-nuanced" response. 

At one point during the hearing, Lefheldt confessed to falsifying an email from a fictitious fencing mother "Dorothy" who disagreed with him and called those members with similar view of "Dorothy" "grand wizard" of Ku Klux Klan.

"It was a poor attempt at humor," Lehfeldt said. 

Rep. Tim Burhcett, R-Tenn., asked Lehfeldt whether he would let his daughter fence against "a man." Lehfeldt suggested he would allow it while boasting about his organization's safety precautions. 

"As long as the competitor has met all the hormonal requirements and complies with the policy, I would be okay with it," Lehfeldt said. 

Later in the hearing, Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., suggested that Lehfeldt was "not" a man for his organization's gender eligibility policy. 

"Real men protect women, you're not one," Mace said. 

Mace even asked Lehfeldt to simply apologize to Turner for punishing the fencer, to which the chair declined and pointed out that Turner received a black card for her refusal. 

Turner told Fox News Digital after the DOGE hearing that she would work to lobby leadership changes to USA Fencing after stepping away from the sport. 

"I'm going to be pushing for people to resign, to be honest. I'd like to see some people resign for the comments that they've made, especially publicly, ones that are harassing and meant to humiliate concerned women, mothers and daughters," Turner said. 

Now, two members on the board of directors have joined that cause.

Amid the ongoing scrutiny, USA Fencing's board voted to amend its current policy that prioritized states with LGBTQ-friendly laws for host sites for competitions and a policy that may have prevented the playing of the national anthem at some events, at its June 7 meeting.

The previous policies became one of the organization's biggest points of criticism after Turner's viral protest. 

USA Fencing has declined to explain the motivation behind the changes. 

"It would be inappropriate for staff to speculate on the personal motivations of USA Fencing's volunteer Board of Directors," a USA Fencing spokesperson told Fox News Digital.

At least 13 Israelis have now died in the hostilities between the Jewish state and Iran that began last week. 

Iranian strikes carried out overnight against Israel took at least 10 lives, according to Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service. 

The fatalities come as the two countries have exchanged a barrage of missiles and attacks over the past three days, with the Israel Defense Forces carrying out overnight strikes on 80 targets focused on wiping out Tehran's energy and defense infrastructure on Saturday, with Iran's U.N. ambassador saying 78 Iranians had been killed in Israeli strikes.

President Donald Trump said in response to the latest exchange that the United States had not helped Israel carry out the attacks and urged Iran to come back to the negotiating table to sign a nuclear agreement that would avoid further destruction.

“The U.S. had nothing to do with the attack on Iran, tonight. If we are attacked in any way, shape or form by Iran, the full strength and might of the U.S. Armed Forces will come down on you at levels never seen before. However, we can easily get a deal done between Iran and Israel, and end this bloody conflict!!!” the president said in a post to Truth Social. 

The conflict began Thursday when Israel conducted a wide-ranging attack on Iran's nuclear and military capabilities hours after the United Nations's nuclear watchdog passed a resolution declaring Tehran in noncompliance with its nuclear safeguards obligations for the first time in two decades. The operation killed much of Iran's military command and its leading nuclear scientists, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps's entire air force command. 

“Operation Rising Lion,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, seeks to “roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival.”

Iran responded by sending a barrage of missiles into Israeli territory, some of which struck a four-story building over the weekend, resulting in four deaths and 24 injuries in the northern district of Israel.

Another one of Tehran's strikes hit a residential apartment building in Bat Yam, near Tel Aviv, killing at least six people, including two children.

“Iran will pay a very heavy price for deliberately murdering our citizens, women and children. We will also achieve our objectives and we will also strike them forcefully. They will feel the might of our arm,” Netanyahu said in response to the attacks. 

“We are here because we are in an existential campaign, which is clear today to all citizens of Israel. Think of what could happen if Iran had atomic weapons to drop on Israeli cities. Think of what could happen if Iran had 20,000 such missiles,” the Israeli prime minister added. 

Tehran's strikes led Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz to warn the regime on Saturday that if attacks on Israel, largely in civilian areas, aren't halted, “Tehran will burn.” Israel followed up on the threat with attacks on two of Iran's critical oil production facilities. 

As Israel's most powerful ally, the U.S. has tried for years to mediate an end to Iran's nuclear program. Trump sought to solve the conflict via diplomatic means and in early April offered Iran 60 days to make a deal or else face “dire consequences.” 

‘TEHRAN IS BURNING,' ISRAEL DEFENSE MINISTER SAYS AFTER OIL DEPOT STRIKES

That deadline came and went unmet on the day before Israel decided to attempt to wipe out Iran's nuclear and military capabilities on its own despite nuclear talks between Iranian and U.S. negotiators being scheduled for Sunday.

Tehran subsequently withdrew from the talks.

Former U.S. men's soccer star Stu Holden tells Fox News Digital what areas of concern the U.S. will address ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

Former USMNT player Stu Holden identified one big issue the team needs to figure out before the World Cup begins next year. 

Holden, 39, said the team needs to figure out which players will be on the field. 

"I think the biggest issue for the USMNT is to figure out who are the 11 guys who are going to step out on that field on June 12, 2026, that can inspire people and get results. There has not been anything in two years since the World Cup in Qatar that has made me feel that we have taken any strides forward," Holden told Fox News Digital.

"I think that is the goal with developing and the amount of investment we have put into the game in this country is that I haven't seen anything that makes me think we are going to do anything that we haven't done before." 

"It is about this group of players, not just making us believe, but making themselves believe but making themselves believe by getting some results and building some momentum heading into that moment. So that when they step out on that field, they know they can get the job done."

In the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, the United States were knocked out in the Round of 16. One of the tournaments USMNT has to determine their starting 11 players for the World Cup is the Gold Cup. 

However, USMNT's best player, Christian Pulisic, is not playing in the Gold Cup, which Holden said is a big deal. 

"I think it's a big deal, because I think anytime the United States national team is playing I want the best 23, 11, whatever it is, American players playing on those fields in those moments. And I also want players that are excited to play and represent their national team in every moment," Holden said.

"And it is not just a, ‘Eh, maybe I will come in this time.' So, I think that is what we are missing. He is our best player and I want to see our best player on the field. And when he is on the field, it sets the tone and makes other people want to be a part of it as well. It is instrumental in building a culture and that is what I think this team right now is really lacking."

Pulisic will be back with USMNT for the World Cup, but Holden has one player that fans should look out for other than Pulisic.

"I think Weston Mckennie is a player that always excites me because he just has some really raw talent. He is an excellent athlete but he is also just a gamer. In some of the biggest moments he turns up with a goal," Holden said.

"My hope is he's a guy who takes and shoulders some of that responsibility for the World Cup next year and be a guy who can really create some moments. We can't just have one good player, we need to have four to five of our top players playing at their absolute maximum for this team to do something special."

Holden played for the USMNT from 2008-2013 and the midfielder scored three goals in his tenure.

The 39-year-old is currently a soccer analyst for Fox Sports and is excited for the world to see the soccer culture that the United States has built. 

"I am excited, as a guy who lives in L.A. now and has for ten years, for people to come and visit L.A. and see the soccer culture that we built here. I think back to the final that we built here in 1994 (when the World Cup was last in the United States)," Holden said.

"The other part I am excited for is, I have two young kids, and I can't wait to take them to games in our own backyard, and let them see the best players, the biggest teams, and experience that, because that is how we inspire the next generation of people. So, I am excited about those fans that will be inspired to be a part of our game going forward."

Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy reports on how President Donald Trump believes that the Los Angeles rioters are being ‘paid' to protest on ‘Special Report.'

The anti-ICE protests and riots in Los Angeles brought heightened scrutiny on activist groups, including the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, the Party for Socialism and Liberation, and Union del Barrio.

CHIRLA and the other groups are now subject to an investigation by Sen. Josh Hawley, R-MO., through the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism, and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said that the Internal Revenue Service is looking into any possible funding of "violent" acts, according to CBS News.

Hawley sent letters to the groups for an "alleged role in financing and materially supporting the coordinated protests and riots that have gulfed Los Angeles."

"Credible reporting now suggests that your organization has provided logistical support and financial resources to individuals engaged in these disruptive actions," Hawley wrote in the letters. "Let me be clear: bankrolling civil unrest is not protected speech. It is aiding and abetting criminal conduct."

CHIRLA Executive Director Angelica Salas condemned the ICE sweeps in Los Angeles during a news conference with Mayor Karen Bass on Thursday, adding that Republicans are "saying the most vicious lies of who we are, what we do and what we're about."

"And yes, we have received a letter from Sen. Josh Hawley. But what I want you to know is that's not going to deter us, it's not going to intimidate us from standing with our immigrant community," Salas said.

CHIRLA said they have not played a role in the violence, according to the New York Post earlier this week. Some parts of the city faced property damage, including vehicles and businesses.

The organization has received $34 million in taxpayer funding in the past, including $750,000 under the Biden administration, according to IRS records obtained by Fox News.

The group runs a "rapid-response network," which Salas mentioned in the press conference has been busy with the recent ICE arrest operations in the area.

"Yesterday, our raids rapid response network did not stop receiving calls until after 7 p.m.," Salas said. "And so, there's two kinds of reports. It's the community is also very scared. So even if they're not at an enforcement site, what's happening is they're witnessing everything."

CHIRLA operates a "deportation defense" legal team, along with other immigration resources, according to its website.

"CHIRLA relies on the love and vision of our community to organize and build power among people, institutions, and organizations to change public opinion and craft progressive policies that promote human, civil and labor rights for everyone," the group's website states on its mission page.

President Donald Trump has claimed "paid insurrections" have played a role in the riots, as a legal battle plays out between him and the state of California for his National Guard troop deployment to the civil unrest.

The FBI told Fox News Digital earlier this week that if any evidence of a criminal conspiracy emerges, they will look into it.

"We're investigating anyone who crosses the line from first-amendment protected activity to violence and are prepared to prosecute anyone who assaults a federal officer or causes damage to government property," Laura Eimiller, media coordinator for the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office, told Fox News Digital in an email at the time. "LAPD, as you know, is also making arrests for unlawful assembly.  Obviously, any evidence of a criminal conspiracy will be investigated."

Democrats have a daunting messaging task that's nearly as colossal as President Donald Trump's sprawling tax and spending bill.

The more than 1,000-page legislation, which touches on everything from Medicaid and taxes to artificial intelligence, food stamps, and gun suppressors, has Democrats scrambling to turn the public against a smorgasbord of policies they hope might derail delicate negotiations among Republicans.

Democrats are on a public relations blitz of near-daily press events to cycle through provisions tucked into the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the backbone of Trump's domestic policy agenda.

“This bill is chock full of garbage, so the more people know about it, the better,” Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI) told the Washington Examiner. “And I don't think we should be so fussy about one person talking about [the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] and one person talking about tax cuts and one person talking about Medicaid. It all works, and we should scream it from the rooftops.”

In the last week, Senate Democrats hosted press conferences on the bill's repeal of former President Joe Biden's clean energy tax credits, extension of Trump's first-term tax cuts that expire this year, crackdown on illegal immigration enforcement, policy effects on women, Medicaid cuts, and tax cuts for firearm suppressors. Some issues, such as Medicaid, were the subject of more than one event.

Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) sees the portions that “resonate with the public” the most as changes to Medicaid and Obamacare that are projected to result in 16 million fewer people with health insurance, potential rural hospital closures from the Medicaid portion, and the scaling back of food stamp eligibility.

“There's so many items in this 1,000-page bill,” Durbin told the Washington Examiner. “Those three things, I think, are the top visible issues. But there's so many others.”

In the House, where Republicans passed their version of the bill last month, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) previewed a “save our hospitals” week of action next week when the chamber is on recess. The Senate is in session and will continue to tweak the House bill.

“Hospitals will close if Republicans are successful in passing the GOP tax scam,” Jeffries told reporters, referencing proposed changes to provider tax credits that hospitals receive for Medicaid patients. “That is incredibly disturbing. Lives will be lost.”

Changes to Medicaid benefits and new work requirements will mean higher healthcare costs and less eligibility, creating a flash point in the broader debate over the bill. Democrats see the government-run healthcare program for lower-income Americans as a pillar of their messaging strategy, along with opposing the extension of tax cuts that are projected to benefit wealthier earners.

While Democrats have been unsuccessful in derailing Republicans so far, there's evidence they could be chipping away at the overall proposal's popularity, particularly Medicaid. Polling shows that the vast majority of Americans agree with the Democrats' position on the program.

A Quinnipiac University survey this week showed that 53% of voters oppose the legislation. Less than a third support it, and 20% have no opinion. Medicaid is overwhelmingly popular, with 87% opposing cuts, including 77% of Republicans.

Medicaid is a point of major friction for Republicans in states with high Medicaid enrollment and who oppose changes that would essentially cut benefits or jeopardize hospital funding. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), the program's loudest conservative defender, vowed Friday to remain “in hourly contact with leadership” until changes are made.

Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) used a rare joint press conference to offer a tongue-in-cheek “second chance” to House Republicans, urging them to demand changes for items they were previously unaware of but now align with Democrats in opposing them. Schumer cited the bill's repeal of green energy tax credits as a leading example.

GOP RALLIES AROUND ESCALATING BIDEN INVESTIGATIONS AS PARTY FEUDS ELSEWHERE ON POLICY

“If they really mean what they say, and they want to change the bill, this is their golden opportunity,” Schumer said. “Don't throw the key away. Don't shrug your shoulders a second time.”

Republican leaders hope to muscle the Senate's revised version through the party's slim majorities in both chambers and send it to the president's desk by the July 4 break.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Masses of demonstrators packed into streets, parks and plazas across the United States on Saturday to protest President Donald Trump, marching through downtowns and small towns, blaring anti-authoritarian chants mixed with support for protecting democracy and immigrant rights.

Organizers of the “No Kings” demonstrations said millions had marched in hundreds of events. Governors across the U.S. had urged calm and vowed no tolerance for violence, while some mobilized the National Guard ahead of marchers gathering.

Confrontations were isolated. But police in Los Angeles, where protests over federal immigration enforcement raids erupted a week earlier and sparked demonstrations across the country, used tear gas and crowd-control munitions to clear out protesters after the formal event ended. Officers in Portland also fired tear gas and projectiles to disperse a crowd that protested in front of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building well into the evening.

And in Salt Lake City, Utah, police were investigating a shooting during a march downtown that left one person critically injured. Three people were taken into custody, including a man believed to be the shooter, who also suffered a gunshot wound, according to Police Chief Brian Redd.

Redd said it was too early to tell if the shooting was politically motivated and whether those involved knew each other. The shooter appeared to be walking alongside the group of thousands who were marching, he added. Video feeds showed demonstrators running for safety as gunshots rang out.

Huge, boisterous crowds marched, danced, drummed, and chanted shoulder-to-shoulder in New York, Denver, Chicago, Austin and Los Angeles, some behind “no kings” banners. Atlanta's 5,000-capacity event quickly reached its limit, with thousands more gathered outside barriers to hear speakers in front of the state Capitol. Officials in Seattle estimated that more than 70,000 people attended the city's largest rally downtown, the Seattle Times reported.

Trump was in Washington for a military parade marking the Army's 250th anniversary that coincides with the president's birthday. About 200 protesters assembled in northwest Washington's Logan Circle and chanted “Trump must go now” before erupting in cheers. A larger-than-life puppet of Trump — a caricature of the president wearing a crown and sitting on a golden toilet — was wheeled through the crowd.

In some places, organizers handed out little American flags while others flew their flags upside down, a sign of distress. Mexican flags, which have become a fixture of the Los Angeles protests against immigration raids, also made an appearance at some demonstrations Saturday.

In Culpepper, Virginia, police said one person was struck by an SUV when a 21-year-old driver intentionally accelerated his SUV into the crowd as protesters were leaving a rally. The driver was charged with reckless driving.

The demonstrations come on the heels of the protests over the federal immigration enforcement raids that began last week and Trump ordering the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, where protesters blocked a freeway and set cars on fire. 

“Today, across red states and blue, rural towns and major cities, Americans stood in peaceful unity and made it clear: we don't do kings,” the No Kings Coalition said in a statement Saturday afternoon after many events had ended.

Thousands gathered downtown, where organizers handed out small American flags and people carried protest signs saying “fight oligarchy” and “deport the mini-Mussolinis.”

Karen Van Trieste, a 61-year-old nurse who drove up from Maryland, said she grew up in Philadelphia and wanted to be with a large group of people showing her support.

“I just feel like we need to defend our democracy,” she said. She is concerned about the Trump administration's layoffs of staff at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the fate of immigrant communities and Trump trying to rule by executive order, she said.

A woman wearing a foam Statue of Liberty crown brought a speaker system and led an anti-Trump sing-along, changing the words “young man” in the song “Y.M.C.A.” to “con man.”

”I am what the successful American dream looks like,” said C.C. Téllez, an immigrant from Bolivia who attended the protest. “I've enjoyed great success here in the United States, and I've also contributed heavily to my community. And if there was space for me, I think there's a way for everybody else to belong here as well.”

Thousands gathered in front of City Hall, waving signs and listening to a Native American drum circle before marching through the streets.

As protesters passed National Guard troops or U.S. Marines stationed at various buildings, most interactions were friendly, with demonstrators giving fist bumps or posing for selfies. But others chanted “shame” or “go home” at the troops.

Amid signs reading “They fear us don't back down California” and “We carry dreams not danger, ” one demonstrator carried a 2-foot-tall (60-centimeter) Trump pinata on a stick, with a crown on his head and sombrero hanging off his back. Another hoisted a huge helium-filled orange baby balloon with blond hair styled like Trump's.

A few blocks from City Hall, protesters gathered in front of the downtown federal detention center being guarded by a line of Marines and other law enforcement. It was the first time that the Marines, in combat gear and holding rifles, have appeared at a demonstration since they were deployed to city on Friday with the stated mission of defending federal property.

Peter Varadi, 54, said he voted for Trump last November for “economic reasons.” Now, for the first time in his life, he is protesting, waving a Mexican and U.S. combined flag.

“I voted for Donald Trump, and now I regret that, because he's taken this fascism to a new level,” Varadi said. “It's Latinos now. Who's next? It's gays. Blacks after that. They're coming for everybody.”

Even after the formal event ended, the downtown streets were packed with a jubilant crowd as people danced to salsa music and snacked on hot dogs and ice cream bought from vendors, many of whom are Latino immigrants. But the previously calm demonstration turned confrontational as police on horseback moved into the crowd and struck some people with wood rods and batons as they cleared the street in front of the federal building. 

Marchers in the crowd that stretched for blocks along Fifth Avenue had diverse reasons for coming, including anger over Trump's immigration policies, support for the Palestinian people and outrage over what they said was an erosion of free speech rights.

But there were patriotic symbols, too. Leah Griswold, 32, and Amber Laree, 59, who marched in suffragette white dresses, brought 250 American flags to hand out to people in the crowd.

“Our mothers who came out, fought for our rights, and now we're fighting for future generations as well,” Griswold said.

Some protesters held signs denouncing Trump while others banged drums.

“We're here because we're worried about the existential crisis of this country and the planet and our species,” said Sean Kryston, 28.

Gov. Tim Walz and law enforcement encouraged people not to attend rallies “out of an abundance of caution” following the shootings of the Democratic state lawmakers. 

Dozens of events were canceled, but tens of thousands still turned out for demonstrations in Duluth, Rochester and St. Paul, which included a march to the state Capitol. Walz canceled his scheduled appearance at the St. Paul event.

Authorities said the suspect had “No Kings” flyers in his car and writings mentioning the names of the victims as well as other lawmakers and officials, though they could not say if he had any other specific targets.

Seda Heng, 29, of Rochester, said she was heartbroken by the shootings, but still wanted to join the rally there. “These people are trying to do what they can for their communities, for the state, for the nation,” Heng told the Minnesota Star-Tribune.

Crowds cheered anti-Trump speakers in Charlotte's First Ward Park before marching, chanting “No kings. No crowns. We will not bow down.” 

Marchers stretched for blocks, led by a group of people holding a giant Mexican flag and bystanders cheering and clapping along the way.

Jocelyn Abarca, a 21-year-old college student, said the protest was a chance to “speak for what's right” after mass deportations and Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles.

“If we don't stop it now, it's just going to keep getting worse,” she said.

Naomi Mena said she traveled an hour to demonstrate in Charlotte to represent her “friends and family who sadly can't have a voice out in public now” to stay safe.

A rally at the Texas Capitol in Austin went off as planned despite state police briefly shutting down the building and the surrounding grounds after authorities said they received a “credible threat” to Democratic state lawmakers who were to attend. 

Dozens of state troopers swarmed through the grounds about four hours before the event, but the area was later opened and the rally started on time. The building remained closed.

The Department of Public Safety later said one person was taken into custody “in connection with the threats made against state lawmakers” after a traffic stop in La Grange, Texas, about 65 miles (105 kilometers) east of Austin. State police did not detail the threat or immediately identify the person, but said there was no additional active threat.

A demonstration of hundreds of people opened to “War Pigs” by Black Sabbath playing over a sound system on the state Capitol lawn in Jackson.

“A lot of stuff that's going on now is targeting people of color, and to see so many folks out here that aren't black or brown fighting for the same causes that I'm here for, it makes me very emotional,” said Tony Cropper, who traveled from Tennessee to attend the protest.

Some people wore tinfoil crowns atop their heads. Others held signs inviting motorists to “Honk if you never text war plans.”

Melissa Johnson said she drove an hour-and-a-half to Jackson to protest because “we are losing the thread of democracy in our country.”

Earlier in the day, thousands of protesters lined the streets in downtown Portland for several blocks, waving signs as passing cars honked in support. They marched around the city draped in American flags to the beat of drums and music.

By late afternoon, a small group of demonstrators amassed across the river to protest in front of an ICE office where three people were arrested Wednesday night after starting a small fire against the building, police said.

Federal immigration officers fired tear gas, flash bangs and rubber bullets in an effort to clear out the remaining protesters in the evening. Some protesters threw water bottles back and tended to each other's wounds. The police department wrote on X that the event was declared a riot.

At least two people were detained and taken inside the federal immigration building.

The grand military parade that President Donald Trump had been wanting for eight years kicked off Saturday with tanks, troops and a 21-gun salute.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The grand military parade that President Donald Trump had been wanting for years barreled down Constitution Avenue on Saturday with tanks, troops and a 21-gun salute, playing out against a counterpoint of protests around the country by those who decried the U.S. leader as a dictator and would-be king.

The Republican president, on his 79th birthday, sat on a special viewing stand south of the White House to watch the display of American military might, which began early and moved swiftly as light rain fell and clouds shrouded the Washington Monument. The procession, with more than 6,000 soldiers and 128 Army tanks, was one Trump tried to make happen in his first term after seeing such an event in Paris in 2017, but the plans never came together until the parade was added to an event recognizing the Army's 250th anniversary. 

“Every other country celebrates their victories. It's about time America did too,” Trump declared in brief remarks at the parade's end.

The president praised the strength of the military's fighting forces and said U.S. soldiers “fight, fight fight and they win, win win” — putting a new twist on a line that Trump regularly delivered during his 2024 campaign rallies after he survived an assassination attempt.

Early in the evening's pageantry, the Army's Golden Knights parachute team descended from overcast skies toward the reviewing stand. The team had been scheduled to appear at the end of the parade, but jumped earlier than planned in the drizzly skies above the National Mall.




At times, Trump stood and saluted as troops marched past the reviewing stand. But attendance appeared to fall far short of early predictions that as many as 200,000 people would attend the festival and parade. There were large gaps between viewers near the Washington Monument on a day when steamy weather and the threat of thunderstorms could have dampened turnout.

Hours before the parade started, demonstrators turned out in streets and parks around the nation to sound off against the Republican president. They criticized Trump for using the military to respond to people protesting his deportation efforts and for the muscular military show in the U.S. capital.

The daylong display of America's Army came as Trump has shown his willingness to use the nation's military might in ways other U.S. presidents have typically avoided. In the last week, he has activated the California National Guard over the governor's objections and dispatched the U.S. Marines to provide security during Los Angeles protests related to immigration raids, prompting a state lawsuit to stop the deployments.

As armored vehicles rolled down the street in front of the president, on the other side of the country, the Marines who Trump deployed to Los Angeles appeared at a demonstration for the first time, standing guard outside a federal building. Dozens of Marines stood shoulder to shoulder in full combat gear beside the National Guard, Homeland Security officers and other law enforcement. Hundreds of protesters facing them jeered in English and Spanish, telling the troops to go home.

A previously calm demonstration in downtown Los Angeles turned chaotic when police on horseback charged at the crowd, striking some with rods and batons as they cleared the street in front of the federal building and fired tear gas and crowd control projectiles. 

In Washington, hundreds protesting Trump carried signs with messages that included “Where's the due process?” and “No to Trump's fascist military parade” as they marched toward the White House. 

A larger-than-life puppet of Trump was wheeled through the crowd, a caricature of the president wearing a crown and sitting on a golden toilet.

Other protesters waved pride flags and hoisted signs, some with pointed messages such as “I prefer crushed ICE,” referring to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Other messages included “The invasion was HERE Jan. 6th, NOT in L.A.” and “Flip me off if you're a FASCIST.”

“No Kings” rallies unfolded in hundreds of cities, designed to counter what organizers said were Trump's plans to feed his ego on his 79th birthday and Flag Day. Organizers said they picked the name to support democracy and speak out against what they call the authoritarian actions of the Trump administration.

Meanwhile, on the National Mall, a display of armored vehicles, helicopters and military-grade equipment was set up to commemorate the Army's birthday. Vendors outside the Army festival sold gear marking the military milestone. Others hawked Trump-themed merchandise.

Larry Stallard, a retired American Airlines pilot, said he traveled to Washington from Kansas City for the weekend “to see the military and see Trump.”

Stallard, who voted for Trump, said it was “hard to believe” people were upset about the cost of the event when “they blow that in 10 seconds on things that we don't even need.”

Doug Haynes, a Navy veteran who voted for Trump, attended the daylong festival to celebrate the Army's 250th birthday, but said the parade “was a little over the top.”

Pointing at a nearby tank, Haynes said that having them roll down the street is a “very bold statement to the world, perhaps.”

The parade was added just two months ago to the long-planned celebration of the Army's birthday and has drawn criticism for its price tag of up to $45 million and the possibility that the lumbering tanks could tear up city streets. The Army has taken a variety of steps to protect the streets, including laying metal plates along the route. 

About 6 in 10 Americans said Saturday's parade was “not a good use” of government money. The vast majority of people, 78%, said they neither approve nor disapprove of the parade overall, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. 

Kathy Straus traveled from Richmond, Virginia, to attend the parade, carrying a sign criticizing its cost and arguing the money could have been used to feed veterans. 

“I thought that it would be more effective to come here than go to a protest with people that think similar to me,” said Straus. 

The parade wound down Constitution Avenue, lined with security fencing and barriers. A flyover of military aircraft included World War II-era planes, including a B-25 Mitchell bomber, and Army helicopters flew low over the crowd, below the top of the Washington Monument. Mounted soldiers from the 1st Cavalry Division made an appearance — horses once played a crucial role in warfare, but today they're mostly used in ceremonial events like today's parade.

Trump swore in 250 new recruits and returning soldiers into service, with soldiers repeating an oath after him.

“Welcome to the United States Army! And have a great life,” Trump said to them afterward.

Country music singer Warren Zeiders performed, as did “God Bless the U.S.A.” singer Lee Greenwood. The event was capped off by a fireworks show.

It appeared that plans to have U.S. Air Force fighter jets fly over were scrapped because of the weather.

A massive military parade to celebrate the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary, requested by President Donald Trump, rolled through Washington D.C. on Saturday, as opponents of the president's agenda rallied in hundreds of cities nationwide for “No Kings” protests.

What to know: 



A line of sheriff's deputies made a push toward the demonstrators who remain in front of Los Angeles city hall Saturday afternoon, continuously firing less lethal munitions. 

A majority of the group from earlier in the day has left.

Some protesters refused to leave, sitting down and yelling back “peaceful protest.”

A man wearing a black face covering and sunglasses began walking through the crowd and jostling with protesters.

A video posted online shows the man used his arms to push protesters who were surrounding him. Some in the crowd then began hitting him.

The man then pulled out the handgun, causing the crowd to scatter. He trained the gun on the crowd. A few people who remained nearby tried to de-escalate the situation.

Another video showed Arizona Department of Public Safety officers taking the man, then handcuffed, into custody as protesters cheered on. The agency declined to answer questions about the encounter.

Holding hands with his wife Melania, Trump left the stage.

Protesters stationed near the celebration of the Army's 250th birthday — which coincided with Trump's 79th — chanted as fireworks exploded overhead.

Protesters held signs including “Thank you Army shame on you Trump” and “Stop the fascist now” with a Palestinian flag being waved by one. 

Dozens of police officers stood nearby as protesters and festivalgoers yelled at each other. People leaving the Army rally walked past protesters, and the occasional “USA” chant broke out, but no confrontations were seen.

There have been several bursts of fireworks above the crowd that had gathered for Saturday's events, with several songs with patriotic undertones playing alongside.

There have also been videos with military members giving testimonials about what their service means to them.

There have been troop formations, heavy artillery displays, flyovers, musical performances and a presidential address. But now the Army's birthday parade is drawing to a close.

Fireworks are the last thing on the official schedule.

Officers fired more tear gas at protesters, surprising those who had gathered on the street and sidewalk a few blocks from a police line.

The clouds of gas wafted toward a family-friendly demonstration that has been going for hours outside City Hall. Young children covered their face with their t-shirts as those in the crowd without protective gear choked and coughed.

“We just wanted to come and support our people and we're getting tear gassed for it,” said Melissa Bran, a 28-year-old pharmacist, as she dabbed her red eyes with a wet cloth.

He's sung the song at hundreds of Trump-related events, and the singer is back performing “God Bless the U.S.A.” to help close out Saturday's events.

Clad in a blue and white sport coat, tie and dark pants, Greenwood performed the song he's sung at Trump's political rallies across the country.

“God bless the United States Army,” Greenwood said, wrapping up.

Trump can be meandering in his big rally speeches, but seemed intent on speaking with breadth—but brevity — with his remarks to celebrate the U.S. Army 250th birthday.

“There is no earthly force more powerful than the brave heart of the U.S. military or an Army Ranger paratrooper, or Green Beret,” Trump said. “They are the best. They are the finest from Bunker Hill to San Juan Hill, from Gettysburg to Guadalcanal, from Yorktown to Shiloh, and from the trenches of the Argonne to the mountains of Afghanistan, the Army has forged a legacy of unmatched courage, untold sacrifice.”

The remarks clocked in at eight minutes.

“We're the hottest country in the world right now,” the president said.

Trump rattled off anecdotes from old wars and stuck to script but did sneak in a vintage Trumpism as he boasted of the attention the United States has garnered.

“If you threaten the American people, our soldiers are coming for you."Trump has been talking up the strength of the U.S. fighting force, saying that enemies that have challenged it have regretted doing so.

Adding that “the U.S. Army has driven bayonets into the hearts of evil empires,” Trump also said U.S. soldiers “fight, fight fight and they win, win win” — a reprise of a line regularly delivered during his 2024 campaign rallies

“Every other country celebrates their victories. It's about time America did too,” Trump said.

The military says the parade will cost between $25 million and $45 million.

It's the first time during the afternoon and evening celebrations that Trump has spoken, aside from administering the oath to new and re-enlisting soldiers. He walked out to the podium accompanied by his wife, who then went to her seat.

After Trump's remarks, the celebration-wrapping fireworks are scheduled to go off.

Vance took the podium ahead of expected remarks from Trump. The Marine veteran said the U.S. askes its military to “kick the hell out of the enemy and to come home safely.”

Vance also wished Trump a happy birthday and a happy anniversary to his own wife, Usha.

Dozens of lingering protesters in Philadelphia were trailed by police on bicycles and on motorbikes with sirens blaring as officers urged them to move away.

They eventually dispersed a few hours after the scheduled march and speeches had ended. At least three people were detained.

Some of the equipment on display is currently in use on the battlefield in Ukraine. The U.S. military has provided substantial support, including weapons and weapons systems from its own stockpiles, to help the Ukrainians fight a war against Russia.

These are some of the parade weapons that have been sent to Ukraine, along with the number supplied, according to the U.S. State Department.

That was Trump's comment to recruits as he swore them in to the U.S. Army. 

“Congratulations, congratulations,” he told them. “Welcome to the United States Army! And have a great life”

Many parade attendees that had been steadily moving through the National Monument lawn froze in their tracks as Trump began giving the oath. Applause and cheers erupted as he finished

Helping bring up the rear of the Army parade were hundreds of future troops, led by the band at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point including members of the Texas A&M Army Corps of Cadets. There were also new enlistees just going through Army initial entry training, cadets from the Virginia Military Institute and cadets from The Citadel in South Carolina.

The final participants include 250 brand new recruits or soldiers who are re-enlisting. 

As they reached Trump, they turned toward him and raised their right hands. Standing at a podium, Trump then swore them into service, with soldiers repeating an oath after him.

Tensions were escalating on the streets of downtown Los Angeles as police sought to disperse demonstrators, many of whom seemed caught off guard — and enlivened — by the abrupt orders to leave.

As police fired flash bangs and canisters of tear gas, protesters responded with loud fireworks and calls to “hold the line.” Volunteer medics in gas masks roamed the crowd, offering saline solution to those affected by tear gas.

Other groups of helicopters have flown along the route, including Black Hawks and Chinooks after the Apaches. Several formations flew along in quick succession.

Many attendees stopped what they were doing and pointed their phones to the sky, with the thunderous helicopters echoing beneath the low-hanging grey clouds. Of all the attractions so far, helicopters have stopped attendees in their tracks the most.

Nine of the aircraft are flying over the parade route. The attack helicopters are designed for combat and ground support.

A previously calm demonstration in downtown LA quickly turned chaotic as police on horseback charged at the crowd, striking some with wood rods and batons as they cleared the street in front of the federal building.

Officers then fired tear gas and crowd control projectiles at the large group, sending demonstrators, hot dog vendors and passing pedestrians fleeing through the street. Some have since regrouped, ignoring an LAPD dispersal order.

“It was a total 100% over-reaction. We weren't doing anything but standing around chanting peaceful protest,” said Samantha Edgerton, a 37-year-old bartender.

The band at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point will lead hundreds of future troops, including members of the Texas A&M Army Corps of Cadets, new enlistees just going through Army initial entry training, cadets from the Virginia Military Institute and cadets from The Citadel in South Carolina.

Last, 250 brand new recruits or soldiers who are re-enlisting will reach the president. As they do, they will turn toward him and raise their right hand, and Trump will swear them into service.

The military says the parade will only cost between $25 million and $45 million because several corporations are sponsoring the celebration.

Among those are some tightly connected to Trump. They include the cryptocurrency firm Coinbase, which added Trump's campaign manager to its advisory council. The technology firm Palantir was founded by billionaire Peter Thiel, who used to employ Vice President JD Vance. 

And Ultimate Fighting Championship's founder, Dana White, is a Trump ally who joined the president at the reviewing stand.

Traditional military contractors like Amazon and Lockheed Martin also sponsored the event.

A few hours after the scheduled march and speeches in Philadelphia had ended, a contingent of police officers on bicycles was monitoring and trying to disperse dozens of protesters who were still gathered in one area, and at least three people had been detained.

The small crowd — some of them wearing masks or other partial face coverings — chanted phrases like “Say it loud, say it clear, immigrants are welcome here” and “Free Palestine,” and some shouted at the officers. They carried signs with phrases including “ICE AN AGENT,” “Healthcare for all” and “The 3rd Impeachment's the charm!”

It had been anticipated that there would be dozens of helicopters flying overhead during portions of the parade dedicated to the Gulf War and global war on terror, but that didn't happen.

Low visibility and lots of clouds in the Washington area seem to have contributed to less of an aircraft presence in the parade. Some Vietnam-era helicopters were part of an earlier portion.

The Texas Department of Public Safety said one person has been arrested in connection with the threat to Democratic state lawmakers attending a rally at the state Capitol. The threat had caused state police to close the capitol grounds for several hours.

A DPS spokesperson said the person was arrested after a traffic stop in La Grange, about 65 miles (104 kilometers) east of Austin. Officials did not immediately release more details about the threat or the arrest.

One person was struck by an SUV that police say was driven recklessly through a crowd at a protest Saturday in Culpeper, Virginia.

Police say the 21-year-old driver intentionally accelerated the SUV into the crowd as protesters were leaving the event.

It's unclear whether there were any injuries. Police haven't yet identified the person who was struck by the SUV.

The rain is a slight drizzle in Washington now as the Army birthday parade crosses the one-hour mark.

Organizers had anticipated the parade in total would last about 90 minutes.

The final war portion of the parade is expected to be a thunderous, 31-minute long procession of all the heavy tanks, artillery and helicopters the Army is counting on for any near-term future conflict. That includes scores of Black Hawk helicopters, all variants of towed and self-propelled artillery, and even the HIMARS High Mobility Artillery Rocket System that has been so coveted by Ukraine as it fights Russia. 

This segment is memorializing the most recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. 

Trump has been critical of the U.S. involvement in those wars. 

The segment kicked off with a guitar riff that sounded like it was from the classic Heart song “Barracuda.”

While the World Trade Center towers were still smoldering, soldiers from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment “Night Stalkers” were packing up to launch Green Berets into a classified counterstrike in Afghanistan. That counterstrike inserted the special forces to ride on horseback alongside Northern Alliance fighters to attack the Taliban and take Mazar-e-Sharif.

Thousands gathered calmly on the lawn near the Washington Monument, in front of Trump's viewing stage, with only a few signs expressing dissent. 

A younger man held a sign that said “No Kings,” while a woman — Kathy Straus — displayed a sign criticizing the cost of the parade, arguing the money could have been used to feed veterans.

Straus traveled from Richmond to attend, saying she wasn't protesting but wanted to offer an alternative perspective to Trump supporters.

“I thought that it would be more effective to come here than go to a protest with people that think similar to me,” said Straus, who is not a supporter of Trump. She added that people haven't been rude, even the ones who disagree with her.

The parade is showcasing a variety of artillery pieces and armored vehicles. 

Helmeted soldiers riding atop vehicles are smiling and waving to the crowd. One made a heart with his hands.

Troops from the 10th Mountain Division deployed more than 20 times to Afghanistan and Iraq as part of the Global War on Terror, following the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

As they march past, the160th SOAR will fly overhead in the three helicopter types they operate – the OH-6 “Little Bird,” the MH-60 Black Hawk and the MH-47 Chinook.



It was the first time that the Marines have appeared at a demonstration since they were deployed to the city on Friday with the stated mission of defending federal property.

Dozens of Marines stood shoulder-to-shoulder in full combat gear, hands on their rifles, beside other law enforcement, including Department of Homeland Security officers and the National Guard. Directly in front of them, hundreds of protesters jeered in English and Spanish, telling the federal troops to go home.

The event got started well ahead of schedule, and it's speeding right along, as ominous weather is still predicted for the Washington region.

In its first 40 minutes, the parade sped through more than 200 years of U.S. Army history, from its inception in 1775 to 1991's Gulf War era.

Compared with anticipated timelines laid out in advance, the parade's timing is now nearly half an hour ahead of schedule. In all, it's been estimated to last a total of about an hour and a half.

Though it looks like a tank, it's technically not. 

Bradleys have been used since the 1960s and were used extensively during the U.S. wars in Iraq. More recently, the U.S. has given some to the Ukrainian military to assist in its fight against Russia.

A howitzer is any type of angled, short barrel gun that is able to launch projectiles high into the air and over long distances.

It had been speculated that bad weather would preempt flyovers during the parade, but at least seven Cayuse, Cobra and Iroquois helicopters were seen in the air over the parade route.

The Iroquois, or legendary UH-1 “Huey,” was used for everything from troop transport to medevac to supplies.

The artillery and armor were key to that quick Gulf War victory, including eight Bradley Fighting Vehicles, two M109 Paladins - a self-propelled howitzer that weighs about half of what an Abrams does - and six M119 lightweight towed howitzers.

America's lightning-fast 100-hour race across Iraq and defeat of Iraq in February 1991 is being represented by troops whose units led the way – the 1st Infantry Division based at Fort Cavazos, Texas, soon to be renamed Fort Hood.

The armored division may be best remembered for racing across the desert in M1-Abrams tanks – and this will be the first time in the parade we see the massive, 60-ton Abrams roll past.

In the battle of 73 Easting, nine U.S. M1-Abrams tanks led by then-Army Capt. HR McMaster were outnumbered by Iraqi tanks – but prevailed, destroying an estimated 50 Iraqi tanks and vehicles.

Trump is expected to speak as part of the Army semi-quincentennial that happens to fall on his birthday. There are bipartisan concerns about the cost of the spectacle, which this civilian commander in chief has pitched as a way to celebrate U.S. power.

But with just 6,600-plus troops marching, it's hardly the biggest to be held in America.

President Andrew Johnson appears to still hold that record, set when his “Grand Review of the Armies” marked the end of the Civil War. That show of force in 1865, meant to salve a war-weary nation, included 145,000 soldiers marching down Pennsylvania Avenue.

            President Donald Trump praised the United States Army as the “greatest, fiercest and bravest fighting force” at the conclusion of a grand display of military might in the nation's capital Saturday as the Army celebrated its 250th birthday with a parade.
    


            “Time and again, America's enemies have learned that if you threaten the American people, our soldiers are coming for you. Your defeat will be certain, your demise will be final, and your downfall will be total and complete,“ Trump said Saturday, offering a stark message amid a time of conflict across the globe.
    


            “The Army keeps us free, you make us strong, and tonight, you have made all Americans very proud,” Trump told US Army soldiers gathered at the National Mall.
    


            The military parade coincided with the president's 79th birthday and took place as crowds across the country attended “No Kings” protests, denouncing what organizers described as Trump's authoritarian policies. The president was welcomed to his parade stand with pomp, circumstance and an impromptu birthday celebration. He arrived to a 21-gun salute — and as the cannons fired, members of the crowd began singing “Happy Birthday to You.”

            The parade featured several million pounds of military hardware, including dozens of M1-A1 Abrams tanks and Bradley and Stryker fighting vehicles rolling through the streets of DC, as well as Howitzers and other artillery pieces.
    


            Nearly 7,000 soldiers were set to participate in the largest military parade the city has seen in decades, which officials have estimated could cost up to $45 million. The event told the story of the Army through its 250-year history, beginning with the Revolutionary War and tracing through major conflicts.
    


            The eras of Army history were represented with vintage uniforms and equipment. As each era began, the parade emcee gave a brief history of the conflict and described the equipment.
    


            The Army celebration has been in the works for two years, though planning for the parade, which was the Trump White House's idea, began a couple of months ago. Trump's desire for a large military parade — featuring all of the military services — dates to his first term. But it was scrapped at the time amid concerns about the price tag and optics of such a display of power.
    


            Trump vowed a patriotic show unlike anything seen before and said it would take place regardless of the stormy weather expected in the nation's capital. The parade ran ahead of schedule and a few events, such as an F-22 flyover, appeared to be canceled because of the weather.
    


            While the president was focused on the military parade in DC, scores of Americans attended “No Kings” protests around the country. More than 2,000 protests across all 50 states were planned through the movement, which seeks to reject “authoritarianism, billionaire-first politics, and the militarization of our democracy.”
    


            Although the “No Kings” organizers deliberately did not hold protests in DC to avoid drawing attention to the parade, some demonstrators rallied in the nation's capital, holding signs with phrases such as “No Fascist USA” and “No Kings.”
    


            The military parade and protests have been amplified by a week of demonstrations against Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in Los Angeles and other major cities. Trump federalized 4,000 members of the California National Guard against Gov. Gavin Newsom's will, with orders to protect federal buildings and personnel amid immigration protests in Los Angeles.
    


            Some states sought to get ahead of Saturday protests by deploying their state's National Guard. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott deployed his state's this week ahead of planned protests, including a No Kings event in San Antonio on Saturday. Gov. Mike Kehoe activated Missouri's National Guard on Thursday “as a precautionary measure in reaction to recent instances of civil unrest across the country.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — A large military parade showcasing American power, requested by President Donald Trump to mark the Army's 250th anniversary, took place in Washington, D.C., featuring tanks, troops and marching bands. Hours before the parade, anti-war protesters displayed signs reading “Homes not drones” near a military equipment exhibit on the National Mall celebrating the Army's birthday.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar remembered fellow Minnesota Democrat Mellissa Hortman, who was fatally shot in her home early Saturday morning alongside her husband, Mark, as a "true public servant."

"I just wish everyone in the world, the political world, knew this woman like we know her in Minnesota, loved by Democrats and Republicans," Klobuchar said of Hortman, who was a member of the Minnesota House since 2005.

"We started out together in politics, moms with young kids, and somehow she was able to balance getting to know everyone, door knock every house in her district, while raising two children," she continued on NBC's "Meet the Press."

Klobuchar said she was at a dinner with Hortman the night before a gunman impersonating a police officer killed her and her husband in an act officials are calling a "politically motivated assassination."

A massive manhunt continues Sunday for the suspect, who officials have identified as 57-year-old Vance Luther Boelter.

The suspect also shot State Senator John A. Hoffman, a fellow Democrat, and his wife, Yvette, in a separate attack at their home early Saturday morning.

Klobuchar said Sunday that the couple was "hanging in there."

She said that Hoffman may need "additional surgeries," but he is currently in stable condition.

Klobuchar said that authorities believe the suspect could still be in the Midwest, and that they've put out an alert in South Dakota.

"We believe he's somewhere in the vicinity and that they are going to find him," Klobuchar said.

Klobuchar emphasized that if anybody in the public spots the suspect, they should "not approach him."

"My concern is that this guy is going to come up against just an innocent, try to take their car, try to go into their house right now," Klobuchar said.

"A lot of the political leaders in our state have received extra protection, but not the innocents out there," she added.

Authorities discovered a "manifesto" in the suspect's car that included several names of officials and lawmakers.

Klobuchar said that she has received additional security without her request.

The S&P 500 is less than 3% from an all-time high. Six of its 11 sectors are within 5% of an all-time high. But even as the U.S. stock market index proves its resilience during a volatile stretch for investors, more money from within portfolios is expected to shift in to privately traded companies.

Jan Van Eck, CEO of ETF and mutual fund manager VanEck, says the trend of companies staying private for longer rather than seeking an initial public offering is here to stay and it offers new opportunities.

High-profile examples include Elon Musk's SpaceX, Sam Altman's OpenAI and fintech Stripe.

According to Van Eck, allocations to private assets will jump from a current average portfolio holding level of approximately 2% to 10% in the years ahead.

Some ETFs have begun to invest small portions of their assets in privately held company shares, including SpaceX, such as the ERShares Private-Public Crossover ETF (XOVR). VanEck has launched an ETF tackling the private opportunity in a different way: taking big positions in the publicly traded shares of the investment giants, including private equity firms and other alternative asset managers, that own many private companies.

The VanEck Alternative Asset Manager ETF (GPZ), which launched this month, has a portfolio holdings list that includes Brookfield, Blackstone, KKR, Brookfield Asset Management and Apollo, which combined make up almost 50% of the fund. TPG, Ares and Carlyle are also big positions, in the 5% range each.

The new ETF extends an existing focus on private markets for VanEck. For over a decade, it has offered investors access to private credit, through the VanEck BDC Income ETF (BIZD), which invests in the business development companies that lend to small- and mid-sized private companies. That ETF has a high level of exposure to Ares, Blue Owl, Blackstone, Main Street and Golub Capital, which make up about half of the fund. It pays a hefty dividend of 11%. 

"You have to believe this is a secular trend and growth will be higher than that for normal money managers, including ETF and mutual fund managers," said Van Eck.

He cautions, however, there is more volatility in these funds compared to the public equity market overall.  "You have to size it appropriately," he added.

Trade negotiations and heightened geopolitical conflict are weighing on market sentiment, but investors seeking stable income can solidify their portfolios through the addition of dividend stocks.

Tracking the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts could inform investors as they hunt for attractive dividend stocks, given that the investment thesis of these experts is backed by an in-depth analysis of a company's fundamentals.

Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

Telecom giant Verizon Communications (VZ) is this week's first dividend pick. The company recently declared a quarterly dividend of $0.6775 per share, payable on Aug. 1. VZ stock offers a dividend yield of 6.3%.

Following a meeting with Verizon management, Citi analyst Michael Rollins noted that the company is upbeat about bolstering its leadership in broadband and converged services over the next few years. The company aims to double its converged wireless subscriptions (customers having both wireless and broadband subscriptions) from the current level of 16% to 17% of its customer base over the next three years.

Given the ongoing promotional backdrop in the wireless space, Rollins noted that competitive data points are still mixed. Nonetheless, Verizon is highly focused on customer retention and improving churn to rebound to its BAU (business as usual) levels in the second half of this year, partly supported by its new upgrade program.

Rollins noted that Verizon is optimistic about improvement in its performance in the second half of the year and continues to expect to add more postpaid phone subscriptions in 2025 compared to the previous year. The analyst sees the possibility of Q3 results, and not the Q2 performance, acting as a catalyst for Verizon stock, if the loss of postpaid phone customers starts to recede. Rollins continues to expect Verizon to lose 75,000 postpaid phone customers in the second quarter.

Overall, Rollins is bullish on VZ's long-term growth potential, noting the "under-appreciated value for its financial prospects."  The analyst reaffirmed a buy rating on Verizon stock with a price target of $48. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI analyst has a buy recommendation on VZ stock, with an expectation of a 14.3% upside.

Rollins ranks No. 249 among more than 9,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 69% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.7%. See Verizon Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.

Let's move to the next dividend stock: Restaurant Brands International (QSR). This is a quick-service restaurant chain that owns iconic brands like Tim Hortons and Burger King. QSR offers a quarterly dividend of 62 cents per share. At an annualized dividend of $2.48 per share, QSR's dividend yield stands at about 3.7%.

In May, Restaurant Brands said that it still expects to achieve its long-term algorithm, which projects 8% organic adjusted operating income growth on average between 2024 and 2028.

Evercore analyst David Palmer said that the company can deliver on-algorithm 8% profit growth in both 2025 and 2026, despite his estimates indicating below-algorithm systemwide sales growth of 5% and 6% in 2025 and 2026, respectively. He explained that despite lower sales, the company could achieve its profitability target in 2025 due to its cost management and lower stock-based compensation.

Palmer added that with QSR stock trading at significant discount to Yum Brands and McDonald's, he sees the company's earnings delivery as "step one to upside."  He also highlighted other catalysts for QSR stock, including ongoing above-consensus International same-store sales growth, positive same-store sales growth for Burger King U.S. and Tim Hortons Canada, and a resale of the China business, which is expected to drive improved income in 2026.

Overall, Palmer is bullish on QSR stock and reiterated a buy rating with a price target of $86, which reflects a P/E (price-to-earnings) multiple of 23x and 22x based on 2025 and 2026 earnings estimates, respectively. The analyst contends that QSR commands a valuation multiple closer to rivals that are currently trading at 24x or higher.

Palmer ranks No. 632 among more than 9,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 7.1%. See Restaurant Brands International Technical Analysis on TipRanks.

Finally let's look at EOG Resources (EOG), a crude oil and natural gas exploration and production company with proved reserves in the U.S. and Trinidad. The company recently announced a deal to acquire Encino Acquisition Partners for $5.6 billion.

The company highlighted that this deal's accretion to its free cash flow supports its commitment to shareholder returns. Notably, EOG announced a 5% increase in its dividend to $1.02 per share, payable on Oct. 31. EOG stock offers a dividend yield of 3.1%.

Reacting to the Encino acquisition, RBC Capital analyst Scott Hanold said, "Encino's assets makes sense from a strategic and value adding perspective, in our view." The analyst reiterated a buy rating on EOG stock with a price target of $145. TipRanks' AI analyst has a buy rating on EOG Resources with a price target of $132.

Hanold highlighted that the deal increases EOG's Utica position to a combined acreage of 1.1 million acres, producing 275 Mboe/d (million barrels of oil equivalent per day). The analyst expects the combined acreage in Utica to surpass 300 Mboe/d by early 2026, which is second only to EOG's Permian position. Hanold expects scaled development to begin in 2026.

The analyst added that following the acquisition, EOG's net debt to book capital stands at 0.3x, with the company still boasting a peer-leading leverage ratio and balance sheet. Hanold pointed out management's commentary about shareholder returns remaining similar to those of recent quarters at 100% of free cash flow, with buybacks continuing to be a priority. He also noted the 5% rise in EOG's fixed dividend.

Hanold ranks No. 15 among more than 9,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 69% of the time, delivering an average return of 29.6%. See EOG Resources Stock Buybacks on TipRanks.

As Mark Carney prepares to host world leaders at the Group of Seven summit in western Canada, he's showing off a foreign policy that's more hardheaded than that of Justin Trudeau.

Trudeau put climate change and progressive social values front and center, an approach that often led to clashes with other leaders. Carney has emphasized economic ties, hard power and alliances that would allow Canada to reduce its economic and security dependence on the US.

Attendees watch the keynote address during the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in Cupertino, California.

Apple's unveiling of iOS 26 and the Liquid Glass interface was the most discussed part of its developers conference, but the real gems were its enhancements to CarPlay, the Vision Pro and the iPad. Also: Delayed Siri upgrades are now targeted for next spring; Apple's AI chief lies low at WWDC; and the company gets cozier with OpenAI.

Last week in Power On: Apple's iOS 26 Liquid Glass interface is a prelude to the 20th anniversary iPhone.

Senate Republicans' proposal to overhaul student loan repayment could trigger a surge in defaults, one expert said.

The Senate GOP reconciliation bill's higher education provisions "would cause widespread harm to American families," Sameer Gadkaree, the president of The Institute for College Access & Success, said in a statement. The proposals do so by "making student debt much harder to repay" and "unleashing an avalanche of student loan defaults," he wrote.

The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions introduced bill text on June 10 that would change how millions of new borrowers pay down their debt. The proposal made only minor tweaks to the repayment terms in the legislation House Republicans advanced in May.

With control of Congress, Republicans can pass their legislation using "budget reconciliation," which needs only a simple majority in the Senate.

Gadkaree and other consumer advocates have expressed concerns about how the new terms would imperil many borrowers' ability to meet their monthly bills — and to ever get out of their debt.

More than 42 million Americans hold student loans, and collectively, outstanding federal education debt exceeds $1.6 trillion. More than 5 million borrowers were in default as of late April, and that total could swell to roughly 10 million borrowers within a few months, according to the Trump administration.

Currently, borrowers have about a dozen plan options to repay their student debt, according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.

But under the Senate Republican proposal, there would be just two repayment plan choices for those who borrow federal student loans after July 1, 2026. (Current borrowers should maintain access to other existing repayment plans.)

As of now, borrowers who enroll in the standard repayment plan typically get their debt divided into 120 fixed payments, over 10 years. But the Republicans' new standard plan would provide borrowers fixed payments over a period between 10 years and 25 years, depending on how much they owe.

For example, those with a balance exceeding $50,000 would be in repayment for 15 years; if you owe over $100,000, your fixed payments will last for 25 years.

Borrowers would also have an option of enrolling in an income-based repayment plan, known as the "Repayment Assistance Plan," or RAP.

Monthly bills for borrowers on RAP would be set as a share of their income. Payments would typically range from 1% to 10% of a borrower's income; the more they earn, the bigger their required payment. There would be a minimum payment of $10 a month for all borrowers.

While IDR plans now conclude in loan forgiveness after 20 years or 25 years, RAP wouldn't lead to debt erasure until 30 years.

The plan would offer borrowers some new perks, including a $50 reduction in the required monthly payment per dependent.

Still, Kantrowitz said: "Many low-income borrowers will be in repayment under RAP for the full 30-year duration."

A typical student loan borrower with a college degree could pay an extra $2,929 per year if the Senate GOP proposal of RAP is enacted, compared to the Biden administration's now blocked SAVE plan, according to a recent analysis by the Student Borrower Protection Center.

The Center included the calculations in a June 11 letter to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.

"As the Committee considers this legislation, it is clear that a vote for this bill is a vote to saddle millions of borrowers across the country with more student loan debt, at the same moment that a slowing economy, a reckless trade war, and spiraling costs of living squeeze working families from every direction," Mike Pierce, the executive director of the Center, wrote in the letter.

Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, said the proposal would stop requiring that taxpayers who didn't go to college foot the loan payments for those with degrees.

"Biden and Democrats unfairly attempted to shift student debt onto taxpayers that chose not to go to college," Cassidy said in a statement.

Cassidy said his party's legislation would save taxpayers at least $300 billion.

When job-hopping, make sure not to accidentally bring your old company's culture along for the ride, said Bob Baxley, a former director of design at Apple.

"I think my own particular mistake, and I've seen this with some other Apple executives as well, is we went directly from Apple — I left Apple on a Friday and I started Pinterest on a Monday," Baxley said on a recent episode of Lenny's Podcast. "And I didn't give myself time to recalibrate to the Pinterest culture."

After leaving Apple in 2014, Baxley went on to work as the head of product design at Pinterest, where he said he "bounced off" the culture, given that he was still acting as he had in his previous role.

"I came in thinking I was supposed to behave the way I behaved at Apple, which is very direct, fighting hard. It's very — everybody cares about each other, it's never insulting, but it's intense," he said. "That's not really where Pinterest was at the time."

It's not just Apple's working environment that has a way of sticking with you, Baxley added — most major tech companies have "really powerful cultures."

"You get kind of indoctrinated into all those standards and it's really deep. It infuses all of your behavior and how you conduct yourself in the company, away from the company," he said. "And so, I think it's pretty hard to immigrate successfully from one of those environments to another."

Baxley said that other former Apple employees have smoother transitions, purely by virtue of taking time off before taking up a new position. Baxley cites Hiroki Asai as a prime example — as Apple's former Vice President of Global Marketing, Asai took years off for "re-wirement" prior to joining AirBnB, according to his LinkedIn.

"It also should be noted that he had — it was a multi-year gap between the time he left Apple and the time he started Airbnb," Baxley said. Asai and Apple did not respond to a request for comment by Business Insider prior to publication.

"At Apple, I think it was Tim or Steve, used to talk about the Apple car wash," he added. "That when you started Apple, they kind of had to take you through the car wash and get off all that stuff that you'd accumulated at other places. It turns out there's a car wash you need to go through when you leave Apple as well."

Though eschewing old habits as you move into a new role is important, that doesn't mean you should forget the lessons your old job taught you, Baxley said.

"The thing I took away from Apple, and I think this is true for anybody changing from one major culture to another, is most likely, the new place hires you because of the values of the organization you left, but not the behaviors," he said.

As you move on, it's worth asking how you can best incorporate the best aspects of your old company's culture in your new workplace, Baxley added.

"And so I think it's important to recalibrate and say, well, I want to hold onto these values," he said. "So at Apple, attention to detail, product excellence, doing everything you can for the customer and the user — so, try to hold onto those values but then think, 'Okay, how are those values best expressed in this culture?'"

Still, Baxley told Business Insider, it won't always be possible to pause between roles — particularly in the tech sphere, where companies usually want new hires to onboard right away. Even if you have to start immediately, it could be helpful to go in while expecting a period of adjustment.

"My biggest point on this topic is that when you go into a new culture you really need to slow down, deeply observe, don't judge or compare, and then when you have a reasonable handle on things, reflect on the best ways to express the values from the old place with behaviors that are appropriate to the new," he told BI.

Leaders of some of the world's biggest economic powers will arrive in the Canadian Rockies on Sunday for a Group of Seven (G-7) summit overshadowed by a widening war across the Middle East and U.S. President Donald Trump's unresolved trade war with allies and rivals alike.

Israel's strikes on Iran and Tehran's retaliation, which appeared to catch many world leaders unawares, are the latest sign of a more volatile world as Trump seeks to withdraw the U.S. from its role as world policeman.

Speaking on a flight to Canada to attend the summit, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he had discussed efforts to de-escalate the situation with Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as other world leaders.

Britain is sending Royal Air Force jets and other military reinforcements to the Middle East.

"We do have longstanding concerns about the nuclear program Iran has. We do recognize Israel's right to self-defense, but I'm absolutely clear that this needs to de-escalate. There is a huge risk of escalation for the region and more widely," Starmer said, adding he expected "intense discussions" would continue at the summit.

As summit host, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has decided to abandon the annual practice of issuing a joint statement, or communique, at the end of the meeting.

With other leaders wanting to talk to Trump in an effort to talk him out of imposing tariffs, the summit risks being a series of bilateral conversations rather than a show of unity.

Trump is the summit wild card. Looming over the meeting are Trump's inflammatory threats to make Canada the 51st state and take over Greenland. French President Emmanuel Macron is making a highly symbolic stop in Greenland on his way to Canada, meeting the Arctic territory's leader and Denmark's prime minister aboard a Danish helicopter carrier.

Macron, who is one of the very few leaders to have known Trump during his first term, was the first European leader to visit the White House after Trump took office, emerging unscathed from the Oval Office encounter.

But despite the two leaders' sporadic bromance, Macron's approach to Trump has failed to bear major results, with France caught up in the president's planned tariffs on the European Union.

Nor did it bring any U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine despite Macron's efforts, together with Starmer, to build a coalition of nations that could deploy forces after any ceasefire with Russia, with the hope it would convince the Trump administration to provide backup.

Trump is scheduled to arrive late Sunday in Kananaskis, Alberta. Bilateral meetings between other leaders are possible Sunday, but the summit program does not get underway until Monday.

Peter Boehm, Canada's sherpa of the 2018 G7 summit in Quebec and veteran of six G7 summits, expects the heads of state to pivot the discussion to devote more time to the war.

"Leaders can accommodate a discussion, perhaps even a statement," Boehm said. "The foreign policy agenda has become much larger with this."

Leaders who are not part of the G-7 but have been invited to the summit by Carney include the heads of state of India, Ukraine, Brazil, South Africa, South Korea, Australia, Mexico and the UAE. Avoiding tariffs will continue to be top of mind.

"Leaders, and there are some new ones coming, will want to meet Donald Trump," Boehm said. "Trump doesn't like the big round table as much he likes the one-on-one."

Bilateral meetings with the American president can be fraught as Trump has used them to try to intimidate the leaders of Ukraine and South Africa.

Former Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien told a panel this week that if Trump does act out, leaders should ignore him and remain calm like Carney did in his recent Oval Office meeting.

"He tends to be a bully," Chrétien said. "If Trump has decided to make a show to be in the news, he will do something crazy. Let him do it and keep talking normally."

Starmer had a warm Oval Office meeting with the president in February, wooing Trump with an invitation for a state visit from King Charles III. Trump has praised the British prime minister, despite their political differences.

Last month Britain and the U.S. announced they had struck a trade deal that will slash American tariffs on U.K. autos, steel and aluminum. It has yet to take effect, however, though British officials say they are not concerned the Trump administration might go back on its word.

Starmer's attempts to woo Trump have left him in an awkward position with Canada, the U.K.'s former colony, close ally and fellow Commonwealth member. Starmer has also drawn criticism — especially from Canadians — for failing to address Trump's stated desire to make Canada the 51st state.

Asked if he has told Trump to stop the 51st state threats, Starmer told The Associated Press: "I'm not going to get into the precise conversations I've had, but let me be absolutely clear: Canada is an independent, sovereign country and a much-valued member of the Commonwealth."

The war in Ukraine will be on the agenda. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is due to attend the summit and is expected to meet with Trump, a reunion coming just months after their bruising Oval Office encounter, which laid bare the risks of having a meeting with the U.S. president.

Starmer met with Carney in Ottawa before the summit for talks focused on security and trade, in the first visit to Canada by a British prime minister for eight years.

German officials were keen to counter the suggestion that the summit would be a "six against one" event, noting that the G-7 countries have plenty of differences of emphasis among themselves on various issues.

"The only problem you cannot forecast is what the president of the United States will do depending on the mood, the need to be in the news," said Chrétien.

In this article

Kelly Ortberg's first Paris Air Show as Boeing CEO was set to be relatively upbeat.

Under his leadership that began in August, the company has made strides in ramping up production of its bestselling 737 Max jets, increasing cash-generating deliveries of new planes, and indicating that it's turning a corner from a series of manufacturing and safety crises and years of lost ground to rival Airbus. Shares are up more than 13% this year, outpacing the S&P 500.

But after an Air India flight crashed on Thursday, marking the first fatal air disaster of a Boeing Dreamliner, Ortberg canceled plans to go to the massive air show that begins on Sunday.

The trade event is a big draw for the industry and is held every other year, alternating with the Farnborough Air Show in the U.K. Boeing, Airbus and other aerospace giants host champagne-flowing parties, hold flashy deal-signing ceremonies with executives flanked by model planes, and show off their new aircraft with extreme maneuvers for spectators below.

"As our industry prepares to start the Paris Air Show, Stephanie and I have both canceled plans to attend so we can be with our team, and focus on our customer and the investigation," Ortberg said in a note to employees late Thursday, referring to Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stephanie Pope.

All but one of the 242 people aboard Air India Flight 171 were killed when the more than 11-year-old Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner that was headed for London on a sweltering day crashed into a medical student dining hall seconds after takeoff from Ahmedabad in western India. The sole survivor was an India-born British national in seat 11A.

The cause of the crash is unknown and will take weeks or months to determine. Questions focus on how the plane so quickly and evenly lost altitude, appearing to glide into a fireball crash. Cockpit voice and data recorders, known as "black boxes," will provide key information.

"It is important that we do not speculate about the accident and let the investigators do their work," Ortberg wrote.

The plane's engine maker, GE Aerospace, said it will postpone an investor day scheduled for Tuesday.

The crash isn't the only outside factor changing the gathering in Paris.

Shortly before the Paris Air Show was set to begin, Israel launched overnight missile strikes on Iran. Hours later, Iran launched drones toward Israeli territory. Airlines canceled flights, with jets in the air diverting or returning to their destinations, while hundreds of others skirted the airspace.

The escalating tensions will make military budgets and spending an even bigger focus for the air show, but they also raise concerns about how conflicts and geopolitical tensions could impact demand for commercial air travel.

Despite the crash and other external concerns, Boeing, Airbus and Embraer are expected to lock in hundreds of airplane orders. Wait times for popular new aircraft models already stretch into the next decade with demand still strong.

Boeing forecast on Saturday that the world will need 43,600 commercial airplanes over the next two decades, with emerging markets driving growth. It expects those markets will account for more than half of the world's fleet in 2044, up from a 40% share last year.

Some of the order signings could come from previously undisclosed customers, though there are many new orders on the line, aviation analysts say.

Ongoing issues, such as a lack of trained workers, have delayed deliveries of new planes, while on-again, off-again tariffs have raised concerns about more expensive aircraft and components.

Pricing has also firmed up. A new Airbus A321neo was going for $65 million as of the end of April, up from $58 million at the start of 2023, while a new Boeing 737 Max 8 cost about $55.5 million in April, compared with $50.25 million in early 2023, according to Ishka an aviation data and advisory firm.

With aircraft still in short supply, lease rates are also going up for older planes for airlines that prefer not to make multimillion-dollar aircraft purchases up front or that might need them for shorter time periods. A 12-year-old Boeing 737 costs $241,000 a month to rent as of the end of April, up nearly 42% from two years earlier, and an Airbus A320 of the same age was $239,000 a month, a 50% gain, according to IBA Insight, another aviation data firm.

U.K.-based IBA predicted manufacturers could see between 700 and 800 commercial aircraft orders during the Paris show, a tally that includes firm orders, options, and looser commitments like purchase intention letters and memoranda of understanding.

Customers could include Ethiopian Airlines and Polish carrier Lot, as well as Vietnam Airlines, AirAsia, Royal Air Maroc, Etihad and Saudi carrier Riyadh, said Ishka.

"A large deal from China is inevitable sometime, for replacement if not growth reasons," Ishka said in a note last week.

Air India, which Ishka had previously listed as a potential customer, was no longer expected to buy new planes given last week's tragedy.

Airplane customers are going bigger as international travel continues to bring in money.

"It used to be all about single-aisle orders," said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at aerospace consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory. Now, "everyone is booking these monster twin-aisle orders for international traffic."

He said major international airlines like Turkish Airlines, Gulf carriers and others have expanded in recent years, competing for more global travelers, "slicing the pizza into smaller pieces."

Since orders are placed years in advance, Aboulafia said he doesn't expect a big impact on demand because of the crash, though some might be held back during the show.

"It's a terrible tragedy. It doesn't make anyone's lives easier," he said. "I just don't think given what we know now it has anything to do with the design or the build of the airplane. It sure doesn't look like it."

Tracy Davis, 42, still thinks that voting for President Donald Trump was a good choice.

But she wishes the president would think more carefully about how his actions are affecting student-loan borrowers like herself.

"I did vote for Trump," Davis told Business Insider. "This was a very big surprise for me. I mean, I was thinking he was going to fix some things, and it didn't go the way I was seeing it going with student loans."

Davis is referring to the Trump administration's move to restart collections on defaulted student loans in early May after a five-year pause. Negative credit reporting for defaulted student loans resumed in October 2024, and Trump's Education Department announced that collections would resume in an effort to restore accountability to the student-loan system.

"Borrowing money and failing to pay it back isn't a victimless offense," Linda McMahon, Trump's education secretary, wrote in an opinion piece. "Debt doesn't go away; it gets transferred to others. If borrowers don't pay their debts to the government, taxpayers do."

Prior to the pandemic pause, Davis said she was able to make her $150 student-loan payments. However, once the pause lifted, she was billed nearly $400, which she said she could not afford. It caused her to fall behind on payments, and her credit score took a hit after negative credit reporting resumed.

"I think they pulled the trigger a little too fast, especially with hitting the credit report, because we're not all in the same situation," Davis said. "I just wish there was more thought put into it."

Business Insider has heard from dozens of student-loan borrowers who are delinquent or in default on their debt, including some who voted for Trump. Borrowers tend to go into default after 270 days of missed payments.

While many borrowers expressed frustration with the abrupt collections restart and the consequences for defaulting, like negative credit reporting and wage garnishment, some said they recognize the importance of restarting the system and ensuring borrowers pay back their loans.

Ellen Keast, a spokesperson for the Department of Education, previously confirmed to BI that Social Security garnishment for defaulted borrowers is paused: "The Trump Administration is committed to protecting social security recipients who oftentimes rely on a fixed income."

However, the department still plans to garnish wages for defaulted borrowers later this summer. Davis is concerned that she might be on the receiving end of that policy.

"If you were way behind and you had no intention of paying them back, yes, go after them, garnish wages," Davis said. "But when you're trying to make it and you're trying to honestly make an effort to pay them off, I don't think that's right that we're getting wages garnished or credit hits."

Miranda Metheny, 37, is in default on her student loans — and she's rethinking the vote she cast for Trump.

"I'm having a bit of buyer's remorse," Metheny said. "Now, seeing what all is taking place, I'm like, maybe I just shouldn't have voted."

Metheny is unable to work due to a disability, and she can't afford to dig into the $600 monthly disability insurance to pay off her student loans while also helping support her two children.

"We already don't make enough to really even survive at this point," Metheny said. "We're all robbing Peter to pay Paul, and now you're going to cut into that? I worry about people that are already hurting."

The Department of Education estimated that 5 million borrowers are currently in default. Recent data from the New York Federal Reserve showed that millions more could enter default this summer; since negative credit reporting resumed in the fall, 8.04% of balances moved into serious delinquency in the first quarter of 2025.

While some higher education analysts previously told BI that the surge in delinquency was expected, many borrowers are at risk of defaulting because they might not be aware of their payment status and are unprepared to afford an extra monthly bill.

Some student-loan borrowers at risk of default said they still support Trump's move to collect on defaulted student loans. Cheri, 67, said that she voted for Trump and supports his stance that loans should be paid back. She hasn't made any payments on her loans since the pandemic pause, though, and she said she's not financially prepared to shoulder another monthly bill.

"I'm not going to bash the Trump administration. But that being said, I think that turning people over to collections is a very drastic move after what we just went through over the past four years," Cheri said. "I'm opposed to that."

Aside from collections on defaulted student loans, the Trump administration is urging Congress to pass the president's big spending bill. The version of the bill that passed the House would condense existing income-driven repayment plans into two plans that have longer repayment periods. McMahon wrote in a June 11 post on X that the bill "will prevent future Democrat administrations from illegally transferring student loan debt to American taxpayers."

Former President Joe Biden's SAVE plan — an income-driven repayment plan that would have allowed for cheaper monthly payments — is also blocked in court, leaving borrowers with fewer repayment options.

As far as default consequences go, Sen. Elizabeth Warren said that McMahon confirmed in a private meeting on June 10 that Social Security garnishments will remain paused.

"The Education Secretary has assured me that the pause that is currently in place will stay in place and if there is to be any change in that, she would get in touch with me directly before we go there," Warren said.

Metheny said she hopes that the administration will consider more relief for borrowers.

"We're not all billionaires," she said. "We can't just come up with that amount of money that quickly."

Artificial intelligence is shaking up the advertising business and "unnerving" investors, one industry leader told CNBC.

"I think this AI disruption ... unnerving investors in every industry, and it's totally disrupting our business," Mark Read, the outgoing CEO of British advertising group WPP, told CNBC's Karen Tso on Tuesday.

The advertising market is under threat from emerging generative AI tools that can be used to materialize pieces of content at rapid pace. The past couple of years has seen the rise of a number of AI image generators, including OpenAI's DALL-E, Google's Veo and Midjourney.

In his first interview since announcing he would step down as WPP boss, Read said that AI is "going to totally revolutionize our business."

"AI is going to make all the world's expertise available to everybody at extremely low cost," he said at London Tech Week. "The best lawyer, the best psychologist, the best radiologist, the best accountant, and indeed, the best advertising creatives and marketing people often will be an AI, you know, will be driven by AI."

Read said that 50,000 WPP employees now use WPP Open, the company's own AI-powered marketing platform.

"That, I think, is my legacy in many ways," he added.

Structural pressure on creative parts of the ad business are driving industry consolidation, Read also noted, adding that companies would need to "embrace" the way in which AI would impact everything from creating briefs and media plans to optimizing campaigns.

A report from Forrester released in June last year showed that more than 60% of U.S. ad agencies are already making use of generative AI, with a further 31% saying they're exploring use cases for the technology.

Read is not alone in this view. Advertising is undergoing a "huge transformation" due to the disruptive effects of AI, French advertising giant Publicis Groupe's CEO Maurice Levy told CNBC at the Viva Tech conference in Paris.

He noted that AI image and video generation tools are speeding up content production drastically, while automated messaging systems can now achieve "personalization at scale like never before."

However, the Publicis chief stressed that AI should only be considered a tool that people can use to augment their lives.

"We should not believe that AI is more than a tool," he added.

And while AI is likely to impact some jobs, Levy ultimately thinks it will create more roles than it destroys.

"Will AI replace me, and will AI kill some jobs? I think that AI, yes, will destroy some jobs," Levy conceded. However, he added that, "more importantly, AI will transform jobs and will create more jobs. So the net balance will be probably positive."

This, he says, would be in keeping with the labor impacts of previous technological inventions like the internet and smartphones.

"There will be more autonomous work," Levy added.

Still, Nicole Denman Greene, analyst at Gartner, warns brands should be wary of causing a negative reaction from consumers who are skeptical of AI's impact on human creativity.

According to a Gartner survey from September, 82% of consumers said firms using generative AI should prioritize preserving human jobs, even if it means lower profits.

"Pivot from what AI can do to what it should do in advertising," Greene told CNBC.

"What it should do is help create groundbreaking insights, unique execution to reach diverse and niche audiences, push boundaries on what 'marketing' is and deliver more brand differentiated, helpful and relevant personalized experiences, including deliver on the promise of hyper-personalization."

 Bitcoin trades above $105,000 even as the threat of war looms in the Middle East. HYPE, BCH, AAVE and OKB could also catch a bid if BTC holds its current range. 

Key points:

A week of solid inflows into the spot Bitcoin ETFs improves the prospects of a rally toward $110,000.

HYPE, BCH, AAVE, and OKB could march higher if Bitcoin sustains above $105,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) is forming a Doji candlestick pattern on the weekly chart, indicating indecision between buyers and sellers. Despite the near-term uncertainty, analysts remain bullish on Bitcoin's prospects in 2025, expecting a rally from $140,000 to $270,000.

Another positive sign is that the geopolitical turmoil caused by the conflict between Israel and Iran did not create panic among investors. According to Farside Investors' data, US-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds witnessed $86.3 million in inflows on Thursday and $301.7 million on Friday, boosting the total weekly inflows to $1.37 billion.

Bitcoin's consolidation just below the all-time high has not generated a sell signal in any of the 30 “bull market peak” indicators monitored by CoinGlass. In a post on X, popular trader Cas Abbe said the models project a target between $135,000 to $230,000 for Bitcoin this cycle.

Could Bitcoin rise toward $110,500, pulling select altcoins higher? If it does, let's look at the cryptocurrencies that look strong on the charts.

Bitcoin found support at the 50-day simple moving average ($103,604) on Friday, but the bulls are struggling to push the price above the 20-day exponential moving average ($106,028). That suggests a lack of buying at higher levels.

The flattish 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If buyers drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the BTC/USDT pair could climb to the $110,530 to $111,980 zone. Sellers are expected to fiercely defend the overhead zone, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could skyrocket toward $130,000.

On the downside, a break below the 50-day SMA could challenge the critical psychological level of $100,000. If the level cracks, the pair may slide to $93,000.

Sellers are trying to stall the recovery at the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart. If the price turns down sharply and breaks below $104,000, the short-term advantage tilts in favor of the bears. The pair may descend to $102,664 and then to $100,000. Buyers are expected to vigorously defend the $100,000 level.

The bulls will have to propel the price above the 50-SMA to seize control. The pair could then surge toward $110,530.

Buyers have been struggling to maintain Hyperliquid (HYPE) above $42.50, indicating that bears are active at higher levels.

The upsloping 20-day EMA ($36.96) indicates that buyers have an edge, but the negative divergence on the RSI suggests that the bullish momentum is slowing down. A break and close above $44 will invalidate the negative divergence, opening the gates for a rally to $50.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it signals profit-booking by the bulls. That could start a deeper correction to $32.50 and subsequently to $30.50.

The pullback is taking support at the 50-SMA on the 4-hour chart, suggesting that lower levels are attracting buyers. If the 20-EMA is scaled, the pair could climb to $42.78 and then to $44. The uptrend will resume on a break above $44.

Contrarily, a break and close below the 50-SMA suggests the bulls have given up. That could accelerate selling, pulling the pair to the uptrend line. This is a crucial near-term support to watch out for because a break below the uptrend line could sink the pair to $30.50.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) bounced off the 50-day SMA ($403) on Friday, but the bulls are facing stiff resistance at $462.

The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers overcome the barrier at $462, the BCH/USDT pair could rally to $500.

The 50-day SMA is the vital support to watch out for on the downside. If the support cracks, the pair could sink to $375. Buyers will try to arrest the decline at $375. If they succeed, the pair may consolidate between $375 and $462 for a while.

The pair has reached the $462 resistance, where the bears are expected to step in. If buyers do not allow the price to dip below $450, it improves the prospects of a break above $462. If that happens, the pair could surge toward $500.

Alternatively, if the $500 level gives way, the pair could drop to the moving averages. If the price rebounds off the moving averages, the bulls will again try to push the price above $462. The short-term trend will favor the bears on a break below the 50-SMA.

Aave (AAVE) soared above the $285 resistance on Tuesday, but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels.

The price turned down sharply from $325 on Wednesday and has reached the 20-day EMA ($269). If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with force, the bulls will strive to push the AAVE/USDT pair above $325. If they manage to do that, the pair could soar toward $380.

On the contrary, a break below the 20-day EMA could pull the pair to the uptrend line. Buyers are expected to defend the uptrend line with vigor. If the price turns up from the uptrend line and breaks above the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to drive the pair to $325.

The 20-EMA is sloping down on the 4-hour chart, and the RSI has dipped into the negative zone, signaling that bears have the upper hand. There is support at $261, but if the level breaks down, the pair could slump to the uptrend line.

The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the 20-EMA. That opens the doors for a rise to $291 and thereafter to $309. Sellers are expected to vigorously defend the $309 to $325 zone.

OKB (OKB) has been trading inside a descending channel pattern for several days. Buyers tried to push the price above the channel on Wednesday, but the bears held their ground.

A minor advantage in favor of the bulls is that they have not allowed the price to fall to the $49 support. That signals buying on dips. If buyers push the price above the moving averages, the OKB/USDT pair could move up to the resistance line. Repeated retest of a resistance level tends to weaken it. If buyers pierce the resistance line, the pair could rally to $56 and then to $60.

This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the $49 support. That suggests the pair may remain stuck inside the channel for a few more days.

The bulls are trying to start a recovery, but the bears are defending the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart. If the price turns down from the 20-EMA and breaks below $51, it suggests that bears are in control. The pair could then plummet toward $49.

On the other hand, a move above the moving averages suggests the bears are losing their grip. That increases the possibility of a rise to the resistance line, which is an important level to watch out for. A break above the resistance line signals a potential trend change.

If buyers drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the BTC/USDT pair could climb to the $110,530 to $111,980 zone. Sellers are expected to fiercely defend the overhead zone, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could skyrocket toward $130,000.

On the downside, a break below the 50-day SMA could challenge the critical psychological level of $100,000. If the level cracks, the pair may slide to $93,000.

Sellers are trying to stall the recovery at the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart. If the price turns down sharply and breaks below $104,000, the short-term advantage tilts in favor of the bears. The pair may descend to $102,664 and then to $100,000. Buyers are expected to vigorously defend the $100,000 level.

The bulls will have to propel the price above the 50-SMA to seize control. The pair could then surge toward $110,530.

Buyers have been struggling to maintain Hyperliquid (HYPE) above $42.50, indicating that bears are active at higher levels.

The upsloping 20-day EMA ($36.96) indicates that buyers have an edge, but the negative divergence on the RSI suggests that the bullish momentum is slowing down. A break and close above $44 will invalidate the negative divergence, opening the gates for a rally to $50.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it signals profit-booking by the bulls. That could start a deeper correction to $32.50 and subsequently to $30.50.

The pullback is taking support at the 50-SMA on the 4-hour chart, suggesting that lower levels are attracting buyers. If the 20-EMA is scaled, the pair could climb to $42.78 and then to $44. The uptrend will resume on a break above $44.

Contrarily, a break and close below the 50-SMA suggests the bulls have given up. That could accelerate selling, pulling the pair to the uptrend line. This is a crucial near-term support to watch out for because a break below the uptrend line could sink the pair to $30.50.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) bounced off the 50-day SMA ($403) on Friday, but the bulls are facing stiff resistance at $462.

The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers overcome the barrier at $462, the BCH/USDT pair could rally to $500.

The 50-day SMA is the vital support to watch out for on the downside. If the support cracks, the pair could sink to $375. Buyers will try to arrest the decline at $375. If they succeed, the pair may consolidate between $375 and $462 for a while.

The pair has reached the $462 resistance, where the bears are expected to step in. If buyers do not allow the price to dip below $450, it improves the prospects of a break above $462. If that happens, the pair could surge toward $500.

Alternatively, if the $500 level gives way, the pair could drop to the moving averages. If the price rebounds off the moving averages, the bulls will again try to push the price above $462. The short-term trend will favor the bears on a break below the 50-SMA.

Aave (AAVE) soared above the $285 resistance on Tuesday, but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels.

The price turned down sharply from $325 on Wednesday and has reached the 20-day EMA ($269). If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with force, the bulls will strive to push the AAVE/USDT pair above $325. If they manage to do that, the pair could soar toward $380.

On the contrary, a break below the 20-day EMA could pull the pair to the uptrend line. Buyers are expected to defend the uptrend line with vigor. If the price turns up from the uptrend line and breaks above the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to drive the pair to $325.

The 20-EMA is sloping down on the 4-hour chart, and the RSI has dipped into the negative zone, signaling that bears have the upper hand. There is support at $261, but if the level breaks down, the pair could slump to the uptrend line.

The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the 20-EMA. That opens the doors for a rise to $291 and thereafter to $309. Sellers are expected to vigorously defend the $309 to $325 zone.

OKB (OKB) has been trading inside a descending channel pattern for several days. Buyers tried to push the price above the channel on Wednesday, but the bears held their ground.

A minor advantage in favor of the bulls is that they have not allowed the price to fall to the $49 support. That signals buying on dips. If buyers push the price above the moving averages, the OKB/USDT pair could move up to the resistance line. Repeated retest of a resistance level tends to weaken it. If buyers pierce the resistance line, the pair could rally to $56 and then to $60.

This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the $49 support. That suggests the pair may remain stuck inside the channel for a few more days.

The bulls are trying to start a recovery, but the bears are defending the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart. If the price turns down from the 20-EMA and breaks below $51, it suggests that bears are in control. The pair could then plummet toward $49.

On the other hand, a move above the moving averages suggests the bears are losing their grip. That increases the possibility of a rise to the resistance line, which is an important level to watch out for. A break above the resistance line signals a potential trend change.

Alon Muroch, founder of SSV Labs, gets candid about Ethereum's current challenges, and why attracting value back to ETH is crucial in its next chapter.

Welcome to Slate Sundays, CryptoSlate's new weekly feature showcasing in-depth interviews, expert analysis, and thought-provoking op-eds that go beyond the headlines to explore the ideas and voices shaping the future of crypto.

Alon Muroch is a man on a mission. As the founder of SSV Labs, which contributes to the second-largest Ethereum staking infra provider, SSV Network, Alon has been passionately championing the virtues of the industry's number-two coin since the early days. Long before Ethereum switched to Proof of Stake, Alon contributed to the initial Ethereum clients. And Eth's lackluster performance and knockdown price are bothering him. A lot.

So much so, in fact, that beyond speaking at the Staking Summit, it's one of the forces at play bringing Alon to Dubai today, raising awareness about the elephant in the room no Eth bag holder wants to discuss. He explains:

“Most of the negative feedback Ethereum is getting right now is due to the token, not necessarily the technology, and I think Ethereum needs to recognize it. The Ethereum community needs to recognize it and then prioritize it, because this divergence will become very dangerous.”

With 100,000 Ethereum validators, SSV Network secures around 10% of all staked ETH, so Alon is pretty invested in seeing the token price rise. And his sense of urgency is palpable.

“We're not focusing enough on the narrative and the reason for holding ETH. That's why ETH is like this,” he bemoans.

This is my first time meeting Alon, and I'm not familiar with his temperament, but I can tell there's a lot on his mind. The price of Eth, for one, which is languishing under $1,800. It's at least 20 minutes past our scheduled meeting time, and he's already ordered his coffee when I arrive at the crowded patio.

After traversing the outdoor area between the conference hall and Madinat Souk in the punishing afternoon heat, my inclination is more toward a nice cold beer than a steaming hot cappuccino. I'm flustered and red-faced after walking round in circles, lost, deep in the souk's rat's nest of perfumes, textiles, stuffed camels, dates, and multiple other knick-knacks on sale. That Starbucks was harder to find than a patch of shade in the Sahara.

I bet Alon didn't have as much trouble. After 10 years navigating his way through Ethereum's many twists, turns, and narrative changes, Google Maps was probably a walk in the park. I apologize for my poor map-reading skills and ask what drew him to Ethereum in the first place.

“Ethereum is at the forefront of decentralization…” he answers, “I've been in Ethereum since the beginning.”

With Eth price limping along like a wounded dog, a divided community bickering over its direction, and a score of alternative smart contract platforms offering better, faster, cheaper, I ask Alon whether Ethereum still holds that central role today. He pauses:

“Yes, and no. Ethereum, the blockchain, I think it is. The roll-up-centric roadmap proved itself and continues to prove itself. In terms of the scale Ethereum is at, I think the technology is very innovative. They know how to take risks. Obviously, there are blockchains with riskier technology or more cutting-edge technology, but they're much smaller, so it's much easier to do. Ethereum is seeing all-time high usage, so that's good.”

He's mentioned the worsening disparity between the Ethereum blockchain and its native token a couple of times. I ask him to expand.

“In terms of the token, it's lagging behind quite significantly, and there's a divergence happening there, which is quite risky for Ethereum. I can debate until tomorrow the difference between Solana, Cosmos, Polkadot, and Ethereum, and why Bitcoin is lagging behind as a technology. I can debate, but that's not translating very well to the actual frontiers of adoption right now.”

Indeed. Yet, if Ethereum's problem is simply about crafting a better narrative, why do projects migrate to other ecosystems in search of more favorable economic models, like Uniswap or dYdX? He's not phased:

“There will always be projects preferring other blockchains. I think it's much more of a marketing opportunity than anything else. You can find very cheap transactions on Ethereum.”

He sips his coffee before doubling down:

“The challenges Ethereum has right now are not technological. It's mostly narrative and a simple question: “Why would the average TradFi user, who doesn't really understand decentralization or TPS, and doesn't know how to differentiate between Solana and Cosmos, or Ethereum for that matter, hold Eth? It's a very big question.”

He explains that traditionally, Ethereum didn't pay much attention to narratives, marketing, and PR, but times have changed, and it's becoming impossible to ignore.

“It used to be the case that institutions came to crypto to learn, and then immediately went to Ethereum, because that was the only game in town. Now, if you look at Wall Street today, well, they might understand the concepts of decentralization and self-sovereignty, but they don't care about it. That's where the narrative plays a major role. You can't have conferences on Wall Street where Solana and Cosmos and Polkadot are going on stage and explaining why people should use them, and nobody is talking for Ethereum. It's coming up with a narrative that is compelling.”

Finding a new raison d'être for Ethereum in the hearts and minds of token holders is no mean feat, particularly in an industry where not everyone is “in it for the tech.” When NGU ceases to deliver and prices bleed steadily down, Alon has his work cut out.

“When you buy Bitcoin, you hold one of 21 million. That's fine. That's a good narrative, and Wall Street and TradFi and everyone else really connect to that. The Solana narrative is “we can beat Ethereum.” So the reason to hold SOL is that if there's a price difference between tokens and SOL wins, it's better to hold SOL than anything else. Why would you hold ETH?”

As a Bitcoiner first, I confess I've been asking the same question for several years, but I don't say that to Alon. Instead, I await his answer:

“ETH has nobody to win and compete with. They're already the biggest smart contract platform, so there has to be another expansion. Historically, there were very good reasons to hold ETH. With ICOs, you had to hold ETH in order to get into ICOs. With DeFi, you had to hold ETH to provide liquidity or to trade. There were really good reasons.

What is the reason now? On my end, the reason is to make Ethereum the trust and security layer for the entire internet of value. If we can make that and attract value back to Eth, the token, then there's a really good reason to hold it.”

What makes Ethereum a good settlement layer compared to other blockchains? Bitcoin's security is widely renowned, I point out. Alon scoffs:

“Bitcoin has zero capabilities of smart contracting, and so developers basically hacked ways to secure things on Bitcoin. Ethereum has smart contracts, so a lot of those types of use cases simply became contracts on Ethereum. What I'm saying is somewhere in that direction. I believe that the Ethereum validator set has superpowers. It's the largest, most diverse, and decentralized validator set on earth.

Those validators know how to run high-performance software for a very long time. It has on-chain entities with performance and all of that, plus you see a lot more off-chain components responsible for very significant application services, and so on. If you can have all of those services run using validators on Ethereum and paying them rewards, then you have this stream of revenue and rewards going back to ETH holders.”

Alon doesn't miss a chance to share his views on Bitcoin as legacy tech, but what are his thoughts on Solana, which seems to be the institutional investors' favorite toy? He replies that Ethereum's “last good competitors” were EOS, but they failed because “their founders did other things.” He says Solana is “basically what EOS should have been if they'd had serious founders,” but:

“In terms of technical capabilities, Solana is taking way more trade-offs than Ethereum. It's not technically as sound as Ethereum, especially from the decentralization, censorship-resistant, and stability point of view. Nonetheless, they're doing a lot of other really good work, interacting with developers, promoting themselves, communicating why Solana, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Ethereum needs to take some of that into what they're doing.”

I mention the POV I've heard that Ethereum should never have switched to Proof of Stake. Given the nature of Alon's business, I'm not surprised when he immediately shuts that down. He interjects:

“It was one of the best decisions. The amount of resources required today to maintain Bitcoin is crazy. It's crazy. It's like saying, let's continue having coal-powered plants and cars and not switch to gasoline or electric. Why? Because coal is very robust. Fine, but it's not a really good answer to anything. There are a lot of things that are robust. It doesn't mean you don't need to change technology. I don't think Bitcoin will ever change to Proof of Stake because Bitcoin is stuck in the past in terms of advancement in technology… Of course, we should have switched. There's no doubt about it.”

Besides alerting everyone to the problems Ethereum faces, what else is Alon doing to turn the Ethereum ship around? He corrects me:

“Look, there is a challenge here. It's not a problem. It's not systemic. It's a challenge we need to tackle because times have changed, and we have competition.”

What are the based applications that SSV is pioneering?

“Based applications are the name for types of services, protocols, and applications that run on Ethereum validators. It's basically SSV 2.0. We coined the term based apps. They're applications that are based in their security on Ethereum validators. That's why they're called based.

It's a type of decentralized application that runs on Ethereum validators and gets functionality and security from them. It can be oracles or bridges, data availability, zk-proofs, AI agents, or whatever type of application you have that is run in a distributed way. Instead of reinventing the wheel and building your own validator set, you can simply tap into the Ethereum and get much better security, much cheaper, and also really connect to Ethereum in a much better way.”

Where do based applications fit into the broader security landscape, and how do they stack up against, say, Eigenlayer? He explains:

“Eigenlayer is similar in the sense that it provides security. The main difference is, Eigenlayer uses capital. We're using validators from Ethereum. So, in Eigenlayer, you take a bunch of capital, you lock it into a smart contract, and then you have bonded operators. The problem with that is that it's not scalable, and it's very expensive because capital is very expensive.

What we decided to do is to go and use the validators themselves, which are 95% cheaper and provide properties that capital doesn't because they directly represent a portion of the value of Ethereum.”

Suddenly, it's all starting to make sense. Based applications benefit from the superior level of security the base layer provides, and Ethereum receives compensation, instead of the value being extracted. What's more, it's “around 95% cheaper,” Alon says.

“That's very significant because security is the most expensive component of a decentralized service, and based applications are very aligned with Ethereum because, as I said before, it comes from the point of creating more value back to the holders, so it has that additional dimension… We need to present a way forward, which I think is by prioritizing a way to attract more value back to the token.”

I wish him luck, and we conclude the interview. Despite dunking on Ethereum with as much frequency as Alon badmouthes Bitcoin, I can't imagine the crypto space without it, and I'd be sorry to see it unravel. The bright side? When you're ~60% off your all-time highs, the only way you can go is up.

 Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor hinted the company would purchase more Bitcoin on Monday when traditional financial markets open. 

Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor posted the Bitcoin (BTC) chart signaling an impending BTC purchase by the company, despite the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, which could rattle global financial markets when they open on Monday.

The company's most recent Bitcoin buy occurred on June 9, with a relatively small purchase of 1,045 BTC, valued at approximately $110 million, bringing Strategy's total holdings to 582,000 BTC.

Data from SaylorTracker shows that Strategy is up over 50% on its investment. This translates to over $20 billion in unrealized capital gains in fiat terms.

Saylor's announcement of an imminent Bitcoin acquisition is another sign of investor confidence in BTC amid the Israel-Iran conflict and the looming, uncertainty over global financial markets. Investors are watching to see how the financial system will react when markets open on Monday, following escalations by both countries over the weekend.

Israel launched airstrikes against Tehran, Iran's capital city, at 22:50 UTC on Thursday. The price of Bitcoin slid by only 3% following news of the initial strike and has held firm around the $105,000 level since the conflict started.

Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded five days of consecutive inflows this week amid the ongoing uncertainty surrounding trade tariffs, the US economy, and the growing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.

BTC ETFs experienced a net inflow of over $1.3 billion in capital this week, according to data from Farside Investors.

The Crypto Fear and Greed Index, a metric tracking overall market sentiment, is currently at 60, indicating "greed" among investors and a bullish sign for digital assets in the wake of mounting geopolitical tensions.

Despite the current price resilience of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, Coin Bureau founder and market analyst Nic Puckrin warned that Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz would negatively impact risk asset prices in the near term.

The Strait of Hormuz is a narrow waterway that connects the Gulf of Oman to the Persian Gulf. This critical oil shipping route is responsible for the transport of approximately 20% of the world's oil supply.

Energy is a necessary input at all levels of the economic production process, and a spike in energy prices will likely impact global financial markets as businesses and investors contend with the increased operational costs.

"Hey bitcoin, Do Something!" 

The viral meme — starring a stick figure poking the ground and depicting a need for reaction — might just sum up the current scene at digital assets trading desks during the slow, early summer days. 

Sure, bitcoin BTC$105,592.48 just hit new fresh highs and is still trading above $100,000, but the P&L is diminishing daily for short-term volatility chasers. 

"Bitcoin's volatility has continued to trend lower, both in realized and implied measures, even as the asset reaches new all-time highs. This decline in volatility is particularly notable amid historically high price levels," said NYDIG Research in a recent note shared with CoinDesk.

And despite macro and geopolitical headwinds hitting traditional assets hard, bitcoin has gone into a chill summer vibe. 

"With the market now entering the typically quieter summer months, this downtrend may well persist in the near term," NYDIG added. 

Of course, this is perhaps a positive trend for bitcoin as it depicts a more maturing market and potentially speaks to its original promise of "store of value," as the price reaches fresh new highs. 

However, traders love volatility, as the greater the movement, the bigger the P&L opportunities are. While fresh record highs might be great for long-term HODLers, for short-term traders, those juicy breakouts are getting hard to make money on. 

So what's driving these calm price actions?

NYDIG is chalking it up to increased demand from bitcoin treasury companies, which seem to be popping up everywhere, and a rise in sophisticated trading strategies, such as options overwriting, as well as other forms of volatility selling. 

The market is getting more professional, and unless we see some true Black Swan events (FTX, anyone?) for crypto, prices will continue to remain calm. 

But all is not lost — there are always opportunities to make money even when it's not as lucrative as it seems. 

"The decline in volatility has made both upside exposure through calls and downside protection via puts relatively inexpensive," said NYDIG. 

Translation: Hedging and catalyst-driven plays are where the money might be in this market. If one thinks something big is coming, this is perhaps the time to position with directional bets. And there are a few big ones coming. 

"For traders anticipating market-moving catalysts, such as the SEC's decision on the GDLC conversion (July 2), the conclusion of the 90-day tariff suspension (July 8), or the Crypto Working Group's findings deadline (July 22), this presents a cost-effective opportunity to position for directional moves," said NYDIG. 

So bitcoin's summer lull might not be a total dead zone; rather, it's a setup for those who are willing to play the patience game and hedge accordingly to trade potential market-moving events.

 Bitcoin holders are using crypto-backed loans to buy real estate without selling their BTC—avoiding capital gains taxes while staying exposed to upside. 

Bitcoin holders leverage crypto-backed loans to buy real estate without selling a single sat while sidestepping capital gains taxes.

The emerging trend is gaining momentum among early crypto adopters, entrepreneurs, and high-net-worth individuals who are “Bitcoin wealthy” but often don't meet the traditional criteria for real estate financing, Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of Ledn, told Cointelegraph.

Bitcoin-backed lending models allow borrowers to leverage their crypto without divesting. Since taking a loan doesn't typically count as a taxable event, clients can access liquidity while retaining upside exposure.

“Borrowing using your Bitcoin as collateral doesn't typically trigger capital gains taxes in most jurisdictions because borrowing against an asset is typically not a taxable event — you are not selling your Bitcoin,” Di Bartolomeo said.

To secure a Bitcoin (BTC) loan, clients lock up BTC at a typical 50% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio and receive fiat or stablecoins. The average funding time for one lender is 9.6 hours, Di Bartolomeo said. These funds are then used either as a down payment or to cover the entire cost of a property.

The model also offers some flexibility. Interest and fees accrue over the loan term, with no mandatory monthly payments. Repayment can occur anytime without penalties, and loans can be renewed if the LTV remains under 60%. Borrowers also retain the right to withdraw excess collateral if Bitcoin appreciates during the loan term.

Di Bartolomeo said that Ledn's Bitcoin loans have found strong adoption in Latin America, the US, and parts of Europe. “The beauty of Bitcoin as collateral is that it is borderless,” he said.

A recurring concern with BTC-backed loans is volatility. “As Bitcoin price drops and the LTV increases, clients will receive notifications to send additional collateral,” Di Bartolomeo explained.

If the LTV reaches 80%, the lender sells the necessary amount of BTC to repay the loan, returning any remainder to the borrower. Since the real estate transaction has already occurred, a liquidation doesn't reverse the property purchase — it simply settles the loan.

Traditional lenders often shy away from crypto due to regulatory uncertainty and credit risk. However, Di Bartolomeo said Bitcoin loans can bypass the need for credit scores entirely. Borrowers post 2:1 collateral, and lenders can liquidate instantly if the value falls.

“We believe Bitcoin is the world's most pristine collateral. It trades 24/7, it is deeply liquid, and transactions can be sent globally in real-time,” Di Bartolomeo noted.

Ledn issued over $300 million in retail loans in the first quarter of 2025 and is on pace to exceed $1 billion by year's end, the firm said. Furthermore, in 2024, clients earned eight times more from Bitcoin's appreciation than they paid in interest, with over 1,000 BTC withdrawn as excess collateral when prices climbed.

Di Bartolomeo added that more and more high-net-worth individuals are turning to Bitcoin-backed loans. Rather than cashing out, they are leveraging their BTC holdings to access hard assets like real estate, maintaining exposure to what they view as their best-performing investment.

In May, Seamus Rocca, CEO of the Gibraltar-based private bank Xapo Bank, said Bitcoin holders are becoming more comfortable borrowing against their crypto as market confidence grows.

On March 18, Xapo Bank launched a lending product that allows users to borrow US dollars using their Bitcoin as collateral. With the product, qualified clients can access up to $1 million in loans while keeping their BTC.

Shiba Inu may have had its time in the spotlight in 2021, but in 2025 there is increasing interest in alternatives like Remittix. RTX, a new PayFi platform, has raised more than $15.5 million and sold more than 527 million tokens at $0.0781. With a Q3 wallet launch and a 50% token bonus on the table, investors are betting on real-world payment utility—not memes.

Shiba Inu price soared over 300% in its infancy stage to $0.000088 in 2021. But that was temporary. Since then, the momentum has dissipated. Rollouts like ShibaSwap and Shibarium have failed to help SHIB regain the lost momentum. 

Current prices range from $0.000013 to $0.000026, with most projections suggesting that SHIB can close 2025 in the $0.0000145 to $0.000023 zone, according to Changelly and CoinCodex. Long-term investors are beginning to lose hope for hitting all-time highs.

As Shiba Inu price action slows, SHIB whales are looking towards use-case-driven projects. Remittix is gaining popularity with its focus on faster crypto-to-fiat settlement in 24 hours. It's already making it easier for African remote workers to receive client payments without the traditional delay. The Q3 release of the wallet will further drive this. 

And with its colossal addressable market for cross-border finance, RTX gives a chance for genuine adoption. Investors are grabbing the 50% bonus on the presale before it hits its $18M softcap.

While Shiba's roadmap targets scalability and DeFi, actual adoption is still not extensive. That's partly why even big SHIB holders are investigating alternatives. Projections do not indicate SHIB crossing $0.00003 anytime in the near future, and competition for memecoins is increasing. The majority desire projects like RTX with precise use cases and tokenomics reflecting real-world financial systems. 

A shop owner in Eastern Europe, for example, already uses Remittix to accept USD settlements from crypto customers through their dashboard interface.

Shiba Inu's price wave taught traders the lesson of how quickly hype can be forgotten. As of 2025, returns are driven by utility, not virality. For this reason, there's more capital flowing into Remittix, a project that is addressing real financial problems with faster returns.

Take advantage of the 50% bonus at Remittix now—before the rest of crypto wakes up.

Shiba inu's (SHIB) supply-side dynamics are screaming bullish, yet the second-largest joke cryptocurrency by market value trades under pressure.

Early this week, SHIB's burn rate surged to over 112,000%, with more than 116 million coins transferred to wallets that cannot spend money. In other words, these coins were permanently taken out of circulation. 

The daily burn rate refers to the number of SHIB tokens permanently destroyed or removed from circulation each day. Token burns are designed to decrease the supply of the cryptocurrency over time, bringing a deflationary appeal to the digital asset.

"Over 527 trillion SHIB tokens are approaching profitability, while the burn rate exploded 112,839% with 116 million tokens removed from circulation," CoinDesk's AI insights noted.

Furthermore, SHIB's ecosystem fundamentals demonstrated strength, with record wallet growth exceeding 1.5 million unique addresses and significant increases in Shibarium layer-2 transactions.

Still, the memecoin remained locked in a downtrend at press time, last changing hands at $0.00001190, representing a 2% drop over the past 24 hours and a nearly 5% decline for the week.

Overnight, the token faced strong selling pressure, with above-average volume exceeding 500 billion units, establishing resistance around $0.0000122.

Bitcoin and crypto have surged this year as traders bet U.S. president Donald Trump's administration will further boost the bitcoin price (helped by Treasury secretary Scott Bessent issuing a surprise crypto market prediction).

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!"

The bitcoin price has traded above $100,000 per bitcoin since early May after rebounding from Trump's tariff-induced slump as rumors swirl of a looming, “extraordinary” White House update.

Now, as traders await an immient Federal Reserve bombshell, the U.S. Senate is poised to vote on the Trump administration's landmark stablecoin bill, with Trump promising it will lead to the U.S. “dominating” bitcoin and crypto and expected to open up the crypto market to “trillions of tokenized dollars."

This week, the U.S. Senate voted 68 to 30 to move forward the so-called Genius Act that would regulate stablecoins, setting the bipartisan bill up for a final vote that's scheduled for Tuesday, June 17.

“The version of the Genius Act that we will invoke cloture on today reflects months of hard work and negotiations from members on both sides of the aisle,” Republican majority leader John Thune said in comments reported by Politico, adding, "it's time to move forward and pass this legislation."

If sent onto Trump's desk for his signature, the Genius Act would provide a legal and regulatory framework for stablecoins—a form of bitcoin-inspired cryptocurrency that's usually pegged to the U.S. dollar and used to move money around the world more quickly and cheaply than traditional payment rails.

"This clarity could unlock trillions in financial and payment rails innovation," Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at Hashdex Asset Management, said in emailed comments, and pointing to stablecoin transaction volume that has recently surpassed Visa and Mastercard.

“A finalized framework [for stablecoin legislation] in the U.S. could unleash a new wave of institutional adoption and product innovation, possibly bringing trillions of tokenized dollars to the market in the years to come.”

The stablecoin market—dominated by Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC—has rocketed from almost zero 10 years ago to $250 billion today, with Wall Street, the world's biggest retailers and Silicon Valley technology giants this year scrambling to grab a slice of the red-hot market.

Treasury secretary Scott Bessent echoed a report from analysts with Standard Chartered Bank this week when he predicted U.S. stablecoin legislation would boost the market 10-fold to around $2 trillion.

Meanwhile, U.S. president Donald Trump said he's proud to be considered the first “crypto president” during a pre-recorded address to Coinbase's State of Crypto Summit, telling attendees that after passing the Genius Act stablecoin legislation he wants to create a “clear and simple market frameworks that will allow America to dominate the future of crypto and bitcoin.”

Trump has fully embraced bitcoin and crypto over the last year, following through on his campaign promise to create a U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve via an executive order in March and also launching his own memecoin and U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin via his family's World Liberty Financial project.

Trump's growing ties to crypto, which Forbes found has added around $1 billion to his personal wealth, has been used by Democratic Party lawmakers to campaign against the Genius Act, with Democratic representative Jamie Raskin from Maryland warning last month that Trump's crypto ventures offered the “perfect opportunity for foreign government, corporate and individual funds to be funneled into Donald Trump's bank account and his family's finances.”

Bitcoin and crypto traders expecting clarity on stablecoin regulation has helped support the bitcoin price in recent months that's been rocked along with stock markets by trade tensions.

“Bitcoin appears to be consolidating above $100,000,” David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said in emailed comments, pointing to the settling market turmoil caused by Trump's global trade war.

“Recent moves to strengthen regulation across stablecoins have also helped.”

 From golden crosses to ascending wedges, Bitcoin traders are increasingly optimistic on the future of Bitcoin price action, even as the market tracks sideways. 

Key points:

Bitcoin traders eye new all-time highs, which include $270,000 by October.

The bull run is far from over, they agree, with BTC price due a major comeback.

Doubts persist over the impact of the next Bitcoin bear market.

Bitcoin (BTC) traders still see new all-time highs and even $270,000 this bull market.

The latest BTC price forecasts from popular market participants agree that BTC/USD is due to head much higher than its current record.

Bitcoin may be consolidating just above $100,000 after a slew of macroeconomic and geopolitical surprises, but the consensus among traders is anything but bearish.

Far from the bull market being over, many see Bitcoin preparing for a fresh period of price discovery.

“Bitcoin is trending upward in an Ascending Broadening Wedge,” popular trader Alan Tardigrade concluded in part of his latest analysis on June 15.

An accompanying chart showed a recurring pattern on weekly timeframes stretching back to the start of the bull market in early 2023.

Another chart, this time the daily, flagged a so-called “golden cross” — where the 50-day simple moving average crosses over the 200-day equivalent.

“This signal has boosted $BTC by 49%, 125%, and 68% since 2023 whenever it has occurred,” Tardigrade commented.

Such perspectives are far from rare in the current market. Even those waiting for an initial drop to test support ultimately see a rebound taking Bitcoin to new highs.

Continuing, fellow trader Merlijn identified a classic price-bottoming structure in the form of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern still playing out.

“Breakout target? $140K+,” he told X followers this week.

As Cointelegraph continues to report, however, some parties hold increasing doubts over the bull run's true support.

Comparisons to the end of the last bull market in late 2021 have begun to surface, and the area around all-time highs continues to deliver price rejections with ease.

In a nod to future bear markets, one of the best-known Bitcoin bulls, “The Bitcoin Standard” author Saifedean Ammous, cautioned corporate buyers over the realities of BTC exposure earlier this month.

“I just hope my message out there to everybody in this business is, Bitcoin has done -70% and -80% before, and it can do it again,” he told the Coin Stories podcast during the Bitcoin 2025 conference.

Hong Kong's central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiative, known as e-HKD+, has entered a groundbreaking phase with the integration of Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). This pilot program demonstrates the transformative potential of blockchain technology in facilitating secure, efficient cross-border transactions between permissioned and permissionless blockchains. With major financial institutions like Visa, ANZ, Fidelity International, and ChinaAMC participating, the study highlights the growing institutional interest in tokenized assets and programmable digital currencies.

The e-HKD+ program, launched by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), aims to explore the use cases of a digital Hong Kong dollar. Phase Two of the initiative focuses on programmability, tokenization, and near real-time settlement of transactions. By leveraging Chainlink's CCIP, the pilot program seeks to address key challenges in cross-border payments, such as counterparty risk and settlement delays.

Programmability: Enables automated execution of complex financial transactions.

Tokenization: Facilitates the creation of digital representations of real-world assets.

Atomic Settlement: Ensures simultaneous transaction completion, reducing risks.

Chainlink's CCIP serves as the backbone of the e-HKD+ pilot, enabling seamless communication between private and public blockchain environments. The protocol allows for secure data and value transfers without the need for traditional asset bridging, solving critical interoperability challenges.

Stablecoin Conversion: Australian investors deposit AUD and receive A$DC tokens on ANZ's private blockchain (DASchain).

e-HKD Issuance: ANZ purchases e-HKD from HKMA, which is then wrapped and transferred to investors.

Atomic Settlement: CCIP facilitates the simultaneous exchange of A$DC and e-HKD, ensuring secure and instant transactions.

The pilot program is backed by leading financial institutions, each contributing to its execution and success:

Visa: Provided its Tokenized Asset Platform (VTAP) for managing the digital money lifecycle.

ANZ: Issued the A$DC stablecoin and connected its proprietary blockchain to Ethereum's testnet.

Fidelity International and ChinaAMC: Demonstrated the application of tokenized funds in streamlining investment processes.

Reduced Settlement Time: Transactions are completed in seconds, compared to days in traditional systems.

Enhanced Security: On-chain identity verification ensures compliance and reduces fraud.

Operational Efficiency: Supports transactions outside standard business hours, including weekends and holidays.

While interest in CBDCs among central banks has cooled globally, Hong Kong's e-HKD+ program showcases their potential in institutional finance. Tokenized assets and stablecoins are projected to reach market sizes of $10 trillion and $3.7 trillion, respectively, by 2030. These advancements promise to boost global liquidity and transparency.

Public Adoption: CBDCs face skepticism among private citizens due to concerns over privacy and centralization.

Institutional Use Cases: Financial institutions are increasingly adopting blockchain solutions for their efficiency and security.

Chainlink's CCIP has proven to be a pivotal technology in Hong Kong's e-HKD+ pilot, bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized ecosystems. By enabling secure, instant cross-border transactions, the protocol is setting a new standard for CBDC interoperability. As the findings from this study are expected by late 2025, the success of this pilot could pave the way for broader adoption of blockchain-based financial solutions.

Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is a blockchain technology that enables secure communication and value transfer between different blockchain networks.

e-HKD+ reduces settlement times, enhances security through on-chain identity verification, and supports transactions outside standard business hours.

Tokenized assets are expected to reach $10 trillion, while stablecoins may grow to $3.7 trillion by 2030.

CBDCs are often criticized for their lack of anonymity and centralization, which raises privacy concerns.

Chainlink provided its CCIP infrastructure to enable atomic settlement and secure cross-border transactions between A$DC and e-HKD.

Back in December of 2024, I decided to hop aboard the bitcoin train and add some crypto exposure to my portfolio.

Markets were flush off of the recent Trump victory, there were whispers of a national bitcoin reserve, and bitcoin had recently broken the $100,000 threshold for the first time. The cryptocurrency had gone mainstream enough for late adopters like myself to deem it investable.

For my first foray into bitcoin, I purchased a share of Blackrock's iShares Bitcoin Trust Trust (IBIT). I later added a share of Semler Scientific (SMLR), a healthcare technology company that holds bitcoin on its balance sheet. I wanted to try multiple methods of investing in bitcoin.

In hindsight, I realize I committed the classic retail investor impulse: buying in because of FOMO. Sure, positive investor sentiment led to gains in bitcoin, as well as the ETF I bought that was designed to track the crypto. But my stock purchase proved ill-timed.

Almost six months later, bitcoin has crossed new all-time-highs, and I have mixed feelings on my investment.

I opted to buy IBIT instead of actual spot bitcoin because it was a more accessible way to get exposure. I didn't want the hassle of setting up a Coinbase account. Plus, buying a single share in an ETF was more psychologically appealing than buying a tiny fraction of a bitcoin (I did not have a spare $100,000 or the risk tolerance to buy an entire bitcoin).

The performance has been encouraging. Year-to-date, IBIT is up about 14%, outpacing a 12% gain for bitcoin itself. It's done its job of tracking the crypto, and even added a little extra. And it's far outperformed the S&P 500, which is up just 2% in 2025.

ETFs can experience slight tracking differences due to management fees, operational costs, and the timing of inflows and outflows. But if you want a rough proxy of bitcoin performance without actually owning the underlying asset, IBIT gets the job done.

A year and a half over its launch, IBIT has gained incredible popularity, growing to over $70 billion in assets under management. Robert Cannon, a financial advisor at Experity Wealth with a specialization in alternative assets, recommends his bitcoin-curious clients to start with the ETF.

"It's the easiest, cleanest representation of bitcoin, compared to some of the other strategies that are a bit esoteric," Cannon told me.

The ETF wrapper has really helped bitcoin adoption take off in the last year, Rahul Sen Sharma, president and co-CEO at the custom index provider Indxx, told me. Sharma's seeing a surge in interest for bitcoin and digital asset ETFs, and he believes Trump's continued support for crypto will pave the way for more mainstream adoption.

Getting bitcoin exposure through other methods was indeed more esoteric — and much less profitable.

I added Semler Scientific to my portfolio on January 8, 2025, and it's down more than 40% since then.

There's a growing trend among companies to add bitcoin to their balance sheets, with Strategy, Tesla, and GameStop being one of the most prominent examples. The president's own Trump Media and Technology Group has recently raised $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin. Semler Scientific started adding bitcoin to its balance sheet in May of last year and now holds over 4,000 bitcoins.

It sounds like a good idea in theory: holding bitcoin as a reserve asset could be a hedge against inflation and dollar weakness, and could also lead to capital appreciation as bitcoin takes off.

Some companies like Strategy have had tremendous success. The firm has accumulated over half a million bitcoins, and the stock has outperformed the underlying crypto year-to-date. However, it's hard to replicate the scale and expertise of Strategy. While many of Cannon's clients often inquire about bitcoin treasury companies like Strategy, he usually recommends they stick to the basics with an ETF.

There were also company-specific headwinds for Semler Scientific. The company had been under investigation from the Department of Justice for allegedly misleading claims about one of its medical devices.

My takeaway from the experience is that buying a single stocks as a bitcoin proxy is probably not a good idea. When you buy into a bitcoin treasury company, you're also inheriting all of its company-specific risks. That includes everything from management decisions and financial health to legal exposure, product performance, and market sentiment around the core business.

As a result, the benefits of diversification with bitcoin are watered down. If you're looking for bitcoin exposure, either buying the real thing or a spot ETF is your best bet.

Maybe the strategy from here on out is to close out of my position in SMLR and do some tax-loss harvesting this year.

While fear grips the broader crypto market and many traders are panic-selling their Ethereum holdings, one whale is taking the opposite approach, snapping up as many ETH tokens as possible amid the market crash. New data from blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain reports that this Ethereum whale has just scooped up a staggering $127 million worth of ETH, raising eyebrows across the crypto community and indicating that they may know something the market doesn't. 

While the market is facing volatility from the Bitcoin price crash and the mounting uncertainty from the Israel-Iran conflict, a major Ethereum whale makes a striking move by accumulating 48,825 ETH. This massive ETH haul, purchased from major crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Wintermute, is valued at a whopping $127 million.

Notably, Lookonchain highlights that the large-scale purchase had occurred during a period of intense panic selling and crowd uncertainty. Highlighting the strategic prowess of this whale, the analytics platform revealed that they had previously pocketed an impressive $30 million in profits from an earlier ETH trade. Now, the large-scale investor appears to be re-entering the market, especially at a time when prices are projected to fall dramatically. 

Based on the timing of the whale's purchases, it seems that the investor is taking a buy-the-dip strategy, capitalizing on steep price drops to accumulate more ETH. This showcases confidence in the potential for Ethereum to surge once the market stabilizes. 

Moving forward, Lookonchain reveals that the whale's recent $127 million ETH purchase was made at an average price of $2,605 per coin—a level that many in the retail crowd fear may still have room to fall. Yet, for this investor, the recent market downturn has become an opportunity worth seizing for future gains. 



Transaction records also show large inflows of ETH into a single receiving wallet, with high-value transfers coming in quick succession. These included multi-million dollar movements from Coinbase hot wallets and Wintermute's trading addresses, consolidating tens of thousands of ETH coins in a short window. 

Before these ETH acquisitions, the whale had received over $127 million in USDC stablecoin, possibly suggesting a planned and calculated move rather than a spontaneous dip buy. 

While there's no direct evidence that this whale has insider information, the timing and scale of the ETH accumulation suggests a strong conviction in Ethereum's near-to-long-term outlook. This kind of aggressive buying rarely happens without premises, and based on prior buying behavior, this isn't just another speculative trader. 

As Lookonchain reported earlier, this Whale's wallet is linked to a history of well-timed ETH plays. Within the crypto community, many members have expressed admiration for the whale's strategic play. Some highlight that their analysis based on the previous $30 million profit is proof of sharp market insight. Others believe that once the market settles down and exits its bearish phase, the investor could be positioned for even greater profits.

The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon and Walmart are planning to launch their own stablecoins, joining the ranks of companies like PayPal, Meta, Ant Group, and Stripe. Once considered a niche crypto innovation, stablecoins are now at the center of a growing revolution in digital payments and commerce.

This shift isn't just about technology — it's about reclaiming control over payments. When household names like Amazon and Walmart explore stablecoins, it's clear that the future of money is being shaped not by banks or governments, but by corporate innovators.

Stablecoins offer instant, borderless, low-cost transactions — unlike credit cards, which typically charge merchants 2–3.5% per transaction. For a retailer doing $100 billion in annual sales, that's $2–3.5 billion in fees. With stablecoins:

This is why companies like Shopify have already enabled USDC payments on Coinbase's Base, empowering global merchants to accept stablecoins without legacy payment infrastructure.

The U.S. Senate is now preparing to vote on new stablecoin legislation, a move that could legitimize — or restrict — this new financial frontier. Regulators like Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal have already raised concerns, especially with Meta's renewed efforts.

Yet the reality remains: governments don't easily surrender monetary control, and stablecoins represent a challenge to centralized financial power. But as with the internet before it, decentralization of money seems inevitable.

A stablecoin is a blockchain-based digital currency typically pegged to the U.S. dollar or another fiat currency. Examples include:

These coins maintain a 1:1 value ratio by backing each token with equivalent reserves. When properly regulated, they allow for safe, fast, and transparent transfers of value.

For many advocates, stablecoins represent more than efficiency — they're about freedom and control over one's money. As one libertarian perspective puts it:

“Whether transferring ₹100 or ₹10,000 crore, individuals should be able to move funds instantly, globally, and securely — without needing permission from a central bank.”

This vision is no longer theoretical. It's being built today — by the world's largest corporations and blockchain developers, side by side.

Stablecoins are no longer experimental. With Amazon, Walmart, Meta, and others entering the race, they're becoming the digital backbone of modern commerce. Whether governments embrace them or fight to control them, the global movement toward decentralized, efficient, and programmable money is gaining momentum fast.

Crypto World News

June 15, 2025 by Vaigha Varghese 

Crypto markets are entering a new phase of accumulation, with select altcoins setting the stage for potentially explosive growth. Bitcoin is facing major resistance at $72,000, and Ethereum is inching toward $3,000. But the spotlight is shifting. Early buyers are hunting for strong fundamentals, application-layer dominance, and platforms solving real-world issues.

Among those drawing the most attention this week are Qubetics, Aptos, Solana, and Cosmos. They're real infrastructure projects with use cases, network activity, and expanding ecosystems. Qubetics in particular is setting itself apart with its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace and a crypto presale that's closing in on a major milestone. Let's dive into why these are the best crypto coins to buy right now and how each project is shaping the Web3 frontier.

Qubetics is laying the rails for one of blockchain's most compelling real-world use cases—tokenizing tangible assets into digital ownership units. The Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace is built to turn real estate, equity shares, fine art, and precious metals into blockchain-registered assets, allowing people and businesses to buy, sell, and trade fractions globally.

Professionals in supply chain, logistics, and capital markets are also using the protocol to enhance asset liquidity, digitize balance sheets, and manage compliance more efficiently. With verified identity features, asset vaulting, and AI-powered auditing, Qubetics is positioned as a compliance-ready launchpad for real-world finance.

In the past 30 days, Qubetics has added 1,100+ tokenized asset pools to its beta platform. The marketplace has recorded $82 million in simulation volume and signed preliminary deals with logistics firms in Singapore and estate developers in Dubai.

Institutional access layers have been introduced for banks and family offices, featuring KYC/AML-compliant APIs. A recent technical update has also improved node reliability by 18% across Europe and Southeast Asia, expanding validator access and reducing operational latency. The development team confirmed that conversations with regulators in the EU and UAE are progressing steadily.

The Qubetics crypto presale is nearing its end—and it's gaining serious momentum. Now in Stage 37, the project has raised more than $18 million, distributed over 515 million $TICS tokens, and onboarded 27,900+ participants. Just 10 million tokens remain before the listing.

The presale price of $0.3370 is fixed.After that, the token will list publicly at $0.40—offering a 20% price bump to those who lock in now. This final-stage urgency is further compounded by the reduced total supply. From over 4 billion tokens, the new cap stands at 1.36 billion. With only 38.55% allocated for public circulation, Qubetics is positioning itself as a supply-constrained utility asset.

For a $2,500 allocation at the current stage, returns could reach $74,925 if $TICS hits $10. Should it climb to $15 post-mainnet—as forecasted by analysts following its cross-border utility expansion—returns could exceed $112,000. With fundamentals in place and the presale closing fast, strategic buyers are locking in early while they still can.

Why did this coin make it to this list: Qubetics is solving a real problem with an elegant, scalable solution. Its RWA marketplace, proven rollout strategy, and crypto presale structure make it one of the best crypto coins to buy in June 2025.

Aptos was developed to address a critical gap in Layer-1 architecture—how to process transactions faster, safer, and more efficiently. Using a parallel execution engine and the Move programming language (originally built by Meta engineers), Aptos can handle thousands of simultaneous transactions with high throughput and low latency.

Its modular architecture allows for independent updates to consensus, execution, and data storage. This design is gaining popularity among fintech apps, gaming platforms, and high-frequency trading protocols needing low response times.

APT is currently trading around $4.63–$4.70, reflecting a 3.4% monthly decline. Technical patterns suggest a make-or-break point, with $4.24 and $3.99 acting as key support zones. If Aptos breaks above $5.00, bullish momentum may resume and push prices toward $6.50 or higher.

While competition from chains like Celestia and Sui has diluted hype, renewed developer onboarding and capital flows into the Aptos ecosystem suggest a potential reversal. Recent growth in dApp development—especially in Asia—is helping to offset bearish sentiment.

Why did this coin make it to this list: Aptos is a next-gen Layer-1 with real performance advantages. Despite market headwinds, its technology base makes it one of the best crypto coins to buy during consolidation.

Solana is built for speed—and it delivers. With block times of 400ms and transaction costs below $0.01, Solana supports a high-throughput, low-latency ecosystem for DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 gaming. What distinguishes Solana is its ability to scale without Layer-2 dependencies, thanks to its core validator structure and Sealevel parallel execution engine.

Recently, Solana has seen increased support from institutional players. Analysts at Ark Invest and Franklin Templeton have identified Solana as a core asset alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum in future digital portfolios.

Solana recently surged to $153.76 and is eyeing a breakout above the psychological $160 resistance level. If breached, price targets at $178 and $182 become attainable. RSI trends are neutral, but rising volume suggests strong buyer momentum.

Technical analysts have confirmed a bullish breakout from a symmetrical triangle, validating the case for further upward movement. Solana's volume strength and social sentiment also continue to outpace other Layer-1s in the short term.

Why did this coin make it to this list: Solana's unmatched speed and strong institutional backing secure its position as one of the best crypto coins to buy as the market gears up for its next leg.

Cosmos is widely regarded as the backbone of multichain Web3. Its Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) allows independent blockchains to communicate and transfer assets without a central intermediary. This is critical in a world where fragmentation threatens blockchain composability.

Through Cosmos SDK, developers can build sovereign chains optimized for specific applications. Osmosis, Secret Network, and Akash all run on Cosmos, showcasing its flexibility and developer-friendliness.

ATOM has climbed 5.57% in the past month, breaking out from a prolonged consolidation. After falling over 54% in six months, Cosmos is now showing signs of sustained upward momentum. Support is strong near $3.73, while resistance looms at $6.11.

Fundamentally, Cosmos is expanding through governance reforms and new developer incentives. The upcoming ATOM 2.0 updates are expected to redefine staking and interchain scheduling, bringing in more efficiency and value capture for the token.

Why did this coin make it to this list: Cosmos offers unmatched cross-chain utility and modularity. As multichain coordination becomes vital, Cosmos remains one of the best crypto coins to buy for forward-looking participants.

These four projects—Qubetics, Aptos, Solana, and Cosmos—are high-utility platforms solving key challenges in speed, scalability, interoperability, and real-world adoption. Each has earned its spot as a front-runner in 2025's digital asset landscape.

Qubetics leads the charge by turning real-world assets into liquid, tradable blockchain tokens—and it's doing so with a scarcity-driven presale nearing its final stage. The current $0.3370 entry point offers a rare final window before public launch. Strategic entries today could shape the portfolios of tomorrow.

1. What is the primary use case of Qubetics? 

Qubetics enables the secure tokenization and trading of real-world assets like real estate and commodities through its RWA marketplace.

2. Why is Aptos different from other Layer-1s?

 Aptos uses a parallel execution engine and Move language to optimize transaction speed and on-chain safety.

3. What gives Solana its performance edge? 

Solana achieves ultra-fast transactions and low fees without relying on Layer-2 chains, using Sealevel for parallel processing.

4. How does Cosmos enable cross-chain compatibility?

 Cosmos uses IBC to allow independent blockchains to exchange data and assets natively.

5.  Is the Qubetics presale still active? Yes, Qubetics' presale is in Stage 37 with a price of $0.3370 until Sunday. Only 10 million tokens remain before the listing at $0.40.

Bitcoin (BTC) BTC$105,592.48 is holding firm above $105,000 after recovering from a sharp downturn triggered by escalating tensions in the Middle East. The leading cryptocurrency dropped below $104,000 following Israel's strike on Iran, but quickly regained lost ground, now trading at $105,590, up 0.15% in the past 24 hours.

Bitcoin's swift rebound suggests underlying strength, with high-volume buying visible during the dip. Analysts point to the $104,000–$105,000 range as an important zone of support, as price action continues to grind upward. Sentiment remains cautious — reflected in a pullback in trader confidence — but structurally, bitcoin's trend remains intact.

Beyond near-term volatility, bitcoin continues to capture the imagination of a younger generation of investors. In a recent episode of the Unchained podcast, Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise Asset Management, described how bitcoin's appeal increasingly transcends traditional financial goals.

According to Park, many younger people no longer aspire to own suburban homes or pursue the white-picket-fence ideal. Instead, they're focused on becoming "wholecoiners" — those who own at least one full bitcoin — as a new form of prestige and long-term security. For some, the goal even extends beyond personal wealth to securing a financial legacy across generations, reflecting the popular meme of "retiring your bloodline."

Park added that bitcoin's global, apolitical nature is central to this shift. It offers a shared value system, allowing people worldwide to "opt out" of systems they no longer trust. That sentiment is fueling a cultural pivot: bitcoin is no longer just a hedge or speculative asset, but for many, it has become a social signal of financial independence and self-sovereignty.

As BTC holds above $105K and macro catalysts loom, the contrast between short-term fear and long-term conviction has rarely been sharper.

Bitcoin has continued to hover around the $105,000 price level for the past 24 hours, a level which it has respected for most of the past seven days. Ethereum, on the other hand, is trying to hold above $2,500, while XRP is also holding its ground above $2.10 within the past 24 hours. 

Some analysts still expect a resumption of bullish momentum once the current range breaks to the upside, but others have taken a more cautious or outright pessimistic stance. One of such bearish outlooks in recent days came from crypto commentator Warren MUPPET, who shared a forecast of a strong downside correction for Bitcoin and other large cryptocurrencies.

The broader crypto market appears to be stuck in a consolidation range, with the Fear & Greed Index currently reading 52, which is a neutral sentiment that could easily swing in either direction. According to crypto analyst Warren MUPPET on the social media platform X, this swing will be to the downside. 

Particularly, the crypto commentator recently posted a blunt list of projected price levels that sent waves through some crypto traders. The post, with no charts or technical context, had simply highlighted the price targets for Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Fartcoin, and Hype. Despite the lack of technical and and fundamental analysis explanation, the message was clear that a sharp correction could be on the horizon.

According to the analyst, Bitcoin will crash from its current price levels to $93,500, Ethereum will crash to $2,100, Fartcoin will crash to $0.68, XRP will crash to $1.6, and Hype will crash to $28. In one of the comments to the original post, the crypto commentator also predicted the possibility of Solana crashing to $85.

These numbers might seem extreme to some, but they are not far-fetched. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP all crahsed to these price levels just two months ago in April. This gives some credibility to the warning and if sentiment turns negative, a drop to these prices may not be out of the picture.

Previous price action data suggests that bearish phases often come up swiftly after prolonged consolidation in high zones. If that plays out again, Bitcoin slipping below $100,000 could quickly escalate into a wider marlet price crash. Also, with Ethereum and XRP also consolidating around their respective resistance levels, the chances of a synchronized following Bitcoin crash below $100,000 can't be ruled out.

Therefore, the bullish/bearish outlook all depends on if Bitcoin can hold above $100,000. If sentiment weakens in the coming days, the analyst's projections may no longer seem like an exaggeration.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,096, Ethereum is trading at $2,540, XRP is trading at $2.16, while Hype is trading at $42.

Ten thousand years ago, mastodons vanished from South America. With them, an ecologically vital function also disappeared: the dispersal of seeds from large-fruited plants. A new study led by the University of O'Higgins, Chile, with key contributions from IPHES-CERCA, demonstrates for the first time -- based on direct fossil evidence -- that these extinct elephant relatives regularly consumed fruit and were essential allies of many tree species. Their loss was not only zoological; it was also botanical, ecological, and evolutionary. Some plant species that relied on mastodons for seed dispersal are now critically endangered.

Published in Nature Ecology & Evolution, the research presents the first solid evidence of frugivory in Notiomastodon platensis, a South American Pleistocene mastodon. The findings are based on a multiproxy analysis of 96 fossil teeth collected over a span of more than 1,500 kilometers, from Los Vilos to Chiloé Island in southern Chile. Nearly half of the specimens come from the emblematic site of Lake Tagua Tagua, an ancient lake basin rich in Pleistocene fauna, located in the present-day O'Higgins Region.

The study was led by Dr. Erwin González-Guarda, researcher at the University of O'Higgins and associate at IPHES-CERCA, alongside an international team that includes IPHES-CERCA researchers Dr. Florent Rivals, a paleodiet specialist; Dr. Carlos Tornero and Dr. Iván Ramírez-Pedraza, experts in stable isotopes and paleoenvironmental reconstruction; and Alia Petermann-Pichincura. The research was carried out in collaboration with the Universitat Rovira i Virgili (URV) and the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB).

An ecological hypothesis finally proven

In 1982, biologist Daniel Janzen and paleontologist Paul Martin proposed a revolutionary idea: many tropical plants developed large, sweet, and colorful fruits to attract large animals -- such as mastodons, native horses, or giant ground sloths -- that would serve as seed dispersers. Known as the "neotropical anachronisms hypothesis," this theory remained unconfirmed for over forty years. Now, the study led by González-Guarda provides direct fossil evidence that validates it. To understand the lifestyle of this mastodon, the team employed various techniques: isotopic analysis, microscopic dental wear studies, and fossil calculus analysis. "We found starch residues and plant tissues typical of fleshy fruits, such as those of the Chilean palm (Jubaea chilensis)," explains Florent Rivals, ICREA research professor at IPHES-CERCA and an expert in paleodiet. "This directly confirms that these animals frequently consumed fruit and played a role in forest regeneration."

The forgotten role of large seed dispersers

"Through stable isotope analysis, we were able to reconstruct the animals' environment and diet with great precision," notes Iván Ramírez-Pedraza. The data point to a forested ecosystem rich in fruit resources, where mastodons traveled long distances and dispersed seeds along the way. That ecological function remains unreplaced.

"Dental chemistry gives us a direct window into the past," says Carlos Tornero. "By combining different lines of evidence, we've been able to robustly confirm their frugivory and the key role they played in these ecosystems."

A future threatened by an incomplete past

The extinction of mastodons broke a co-evolutionary alliance that had lasted for millennia. The researchers applied a machine learning model to compare the current conservation status of megafauna-dependent plants across different South American regions. The results are alarming: in central Chile, 40% of these species are now threatened -- a rate four times higher than in tropical regions where animals such as tapirs or monkeys still act as alternative seed dispersers.

"Where that ecological relationship between plants and animals has been entirely severed, the consequences remain visible even thousands of years later," says study co-author Andrea P. Loayza.

Species like the gomortega (Gomortega keule), the Chilean palm, and the monkey puzzle tree (Araucaria araucana) now survive in small, fragmented populations with low genetic diversity. They are living remnants of an extinct interaction.

Paleontology as a key to conservation

Beyond its fossil discoveries, the study sends a clear message: understanding the past is essential to addressing today's ecological crises. "Paleontology isn't just about telling old stories," concludes Florent Rivals. "It helps us recognize what we've lost -- and what we still have a chance to save."

New research led by Dr. James De Buizer at the SETI Institute and Dr. Wanggi Lim at IPAC at Caltech revealed surprising results about the rate at which high-mass stars form in the Galactic Center of the Milky Way. The researchers based their study primarily on observations from NASA's now-retired SOFIA airborne observatory, focusing on three star-forming regions -- Sgr B1, Sgr B2, and Sgr C -- located at the heart of the Galaxy. Although the central part of our Galaxy has a much higher density of star-forming material than the rest of the Milky Way, in the Galactic Center, the current rate of formation of massive stars (those larger than 8 times the mass of our Sun) appears to be lower compared to the rest of the Galaxy.

The team compared these three Galactic Center star-forming regions to similar-sized regions further out in the Galaxy, including those closer to our Sun, and confirmed that the rate of star formation is below average near the Galactic Center. Their study finds that despite the Galactic Center's dense clouds of gas and dust, conditions that typically produce stars with high masses, these star-forming regions struggle to form high-mass stars. Furthermore, the studied areas appear to lack sufficient material for continued star formation, suggesting such regions effectively produce just one generation of stars, unlike typical star-forming regions.

"Recent studies have concluded that star formation is likely depressed near the Galactic Center, and even that there may be no present star formation occurring there," said De Buizer, lead author of the study. "Since presently-forming massive stars are brightest at long infrared wavelengths, we obtained the highest resolution infrared images of our Galaxy's central-most star-forming regions. The data show that, contrarily, massive stars are presently forming there, but confirm at a relatively low rate."

The study suggests that the reason for the slowdown in star formation is due to the extreme conditions in the Galactic Center. These regions orbit swiftly around the black hole at the center of the Galaxy, interacting with older stars and possibly with other material falling toward the black hole. These conditions could inhibit gas clouds from holding together long enough to form stars in the first place and prevent those that do form stars from staying together long enough for continued future star formation.

However, Sgr B2 appears to be the exception. Although its rate of present massive star formation is unusually low, like the other Galactic Center regions studied, it seems to have maintained its reservoir of dense gas and dust, allowing for a future emergent star cluster to be born.

Traditionally, astronomers have viewed giant H II regions -- large clouds of gas, mainly hydrogen, in space like Sgr B1 and Sgr C -- as hosts of massive star clusters still embedded in their birth clouds. This study challenges that assumption. The team argues these two regions may not fit the classical definition at all, or they may represent a new, previously unrecognized category of stellar nursery.

Enshrouded in gas and dust that obscure these star-forming regions from view in all but the longest infrared wavelengths, SOFIA's high-resolution infrared eyes allowed the team to identify more than six dozen presently-forming massive stars within the Galactic Center regions. However, these regions formed fewer stars -- and topped out at a lower stellar mass -- than the Galactic average.

"These Galactic Center star-forming regions are in many ways very similar to the massive star-forming regions in the relatively calm backwaters of our galaxy," said Lim. "However, the most massive stars we are finding in these Galactic Center regions, though still remarkably large, fall short in both size and quantity compared to those found in similar regions elsewhere in our Galaxy. Furthermore, such star-forming regions typically hang on to large reservoirs of star-forming material and continue to produce multiple epochs of stars, but that appears to not be the case for these Galactic Center regions."

Lim will present the results of this study at the 246th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Anchorage, AK.

Scientists know the stomach talks to the brain, but two new studies from Rutgers Health researchers suggest the conversation is really a tug-of-war, with one side urging another bite, the other signaling "enough."

Together, the papers in Nature Metabolism and Nature Communications trace the first complementary wiring diagram of hunger and satiety in ways that could refine today's blockbuster weight-loss drugs and blunt their side effects.

One study, led by Zhiping Pang of Robert Wood Johnson Medical School's Center for NeuroMetabolism, pinpointed a slender bundle of neurons that runs from the hypothalamus to the brainstem.

The cells bristle with GLP-1 receptors, the proteins mimicked by weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic. When Pang's team hit the pathway with pulses of light, well-fed mice quit eating; when they silenced the circuit or deleted the receptor, the animals packed on weight. Fasting weakened the connection until a burst of natural or synthetic GLP-1 restored it.

"The synapse is a volume knob that only turns up when energy stores are low," Pang said, warning that drugs that keep the signal high around the clock could disrupt the brain's normal rhythm and create some of the side effects of GLP-1 drugs such as nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea and muscle wasting.

For the other paper, Mark Rossi, who co-leads the Center for NeuroMetabolism with Pang, charted the circuit that triggers hunger. His group traced inhibitory neurons in the stria terminalis to similar cells in the lateral hypothalamus.

When researchers triggered the connection, a suddenly hungry mouse would sprint for sugar water; when they blocked it, the animals lounged even after a long fast.

Hormones modulated the effect. An injection of ghrelin, the gut's hunger messenger, revved food seeking, while leptin, the satiety signal, slammed it shut. Overfed mice gradually lost the response, but it returned after diets made them thin again.

"Pang's pathway shuts things down," Rossi said. "Ours steps on the accelerator."

Although the circuits sit in different corners of the brain, members of both teams saw the same principle: Energy state rewires synapses quickly. During a fast, the hunger circuit gains sensitivity while the satiety circuit loosens; after a meal, the relationship flips.

It is the first time researchers have watched the push-pull mechanism operate in parallel pathways, a yin-yang arrangement that may explain why diets and drugs that treat only one side of the equation often lose power over time and may help in making drugs that work even better than today's generation of GLP-1 medications.

GLP-1 mimics such as Wegovy and Zepbound can trigger double-digit weight loss but also nausea, diarrhea and, in some cases, muscle wasting. Pang's data suggest a therapy targeting only the brainstem circuit and sparing peripheral organs might curb eating without the side effects. Conversely, Rossi's work hints that restoring the body's response to the hunger-regulating hormone ghrelin could help dieters who plateau after months of calorie cutting.

Both projects relied on the modern toolkit of neural biology - optogenetics to fire axons with laser light, chemogenetics to silence them, fiber-optic photometry to watch calcium pulses and old-fashioned patch-clamp recordings to monitor single synapses. Those techniques allowed the researchers to tune individual pathways with a precision that has only recently become possible.

Follow-up work from both teams will explore more questions that could improve drug design. Pang wants to measure GLP-1 release in real time to see whether short bursts, rather than constant exposure, are enough to calm appetite. Rossi is cataloging the molecular identity of his hunger-trigger cells in hopes of finding drug targets that steer craving without crushing the joy of eating.

"You want to keep the system's flexibility," Rossi said. "It's the difference between dimming the lights and flicking them off."

Allowing the brain to correctly rebalance the desire to eat or stop eating throughout the day, rather than using drugs to keep desire constantly low, may be an important ingredient in tomorrow's weight-loss prescriptions.

Satellite data used by archaeologists to find traces of ancient ruins hidden under dense forest canopies can also be used to improve the speed and accuracy to measure how much carbon is retained and released in forests.

Understanding this carbon cycle is key to climate change research, according to Hamdi Zurqani, an assistant professor of geospatial science for the Arkansas Forest Resources Center and the College of Forestry, Agriculture and Natural Resources at the University of Arkansas at Monticello. The center is headquartered at UAM and conducts research and extension activities through the Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station and the Cooperative Extension Service, the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture's research and outreach arms.

"Forests are often called the lungs of our planet, and for good reason," Zurqani said. "They store roughly 80 percent of the world's terrestrial carbon and play a critical role in regulating Earth's climate."

To measure a forest's carbon cycle, a calculation of forest aboveground biomass is needed. Though effective, traditional ground-based methods for estimating forest aboveground biomass are labor-intensive, time-consuming and limited in spatial coverage abilities, Zurqani said.

In a study recently published in Ecological Informatics, Zurqani shows how information from open-access satellites can be integrated on Google Earth Engine with artificial intelligence algorithms to quickly and accurately map large-scale forest aboveground biomass, even in remote areas where accessibility is often an issue.

Zurqani's novel approach uses data from NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation LiDAR, also known as GEDI LiDAR, which includes three lasers installed on the International Space Station. The system can precisely measure three-dimensional forest canopy height, canopy vertical structure and surface elevation. LiDAR stands for "light detection and ranging" and uses light pulses to measure distance and create 3D models.

Zurqani also used imagery data from the European Space Agency's collection of Earth observation Copernicus Sentinel satellites -- Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. Combining the 3D imagery from GEDI and the optical imagery from the Sentinels, Zurqani improved the accuracy of biomass estimations.

The study tested four machine learning algorithms to analyze the data: Gradient tree boosting, random forest, classification and regression trees, or CART, and support vector machine. Gradient tree boosting achieved the highest accuracy score and the lowest error rates. Random forest came in second, proving reliable but slightly less precise. CART provided reasonable estimates but tended to focus on a smaller subset. The support vector machine algorithm struggled, Zurqani said, highlighting that not all AI models are equally suited for estimating aboveground forest biomass in this study.

The most accurate predictions, Zurqani said, came from combining Sentinel-2 optical data, vegetation indices, topographic features, and canopy height with the GEDI LiDAR dataset serving as the reference input for both training and testing the machine learning models, showing that multi-source data integration is critical for reliable biomass mapping.

Why it matters

Zurqani said that accurate forest biomass mapping has real-world implications for better accounting of carbon and improved forest management on a global scale. With more accurate assessments, governments and organizations can more precisely track carbon sequestration and emissions from deforestation to inform policy decisions.

The road ahead

While the study marks a leap forward in measuring aboveground forest biomass, Zurqani said the challenges remaining include the impact weather can have on satellite data. Some regions still lack high-resolution LiDAR coverage. He added that future research may explore deeper AI models, such as neural networks, to refine predictions further.

"One thing is clear," Zurqani said. "As climate change intensifies, technology like this will be indispensable in safeguarding our forests and the planet."

So introducing new microbiota won't solve the problem. The theory that needs to be tested is that we know microbiota can switch SAD on, but does removal of said microbiota turn it off? It needs to be an antibiotic cleansing. It can even be DIY. People can try this on themselves. I think the unknown factor here though is whether or not a persons diet is introducing the SAD causing microbiota.

But does the system have hysteresis? Can the flip be switched the other way? Introduce antibiotics to wipe out all the microbiota and does the SAD improve?There can be human trials for this given that antibiotics are approved low risk medicines. Clinical trials with antibiotics to clean out and reset the microbiome along with strict diets in attempt to prevent reintroduction of said microbiota.It can even be DIY.

Taiwan's International Trade Administration rubber-stamped the decision to tighten controls.

Two of the most important companies behind China's semiconductor self-sufficiency and AI supremacy hopes were dealt a blow on Saturday, with their addition to Taiwan's strategic high-tech commodities entity list. Huawei and SMIC have already been sanctioned by the U.S., but the constriction of supplies from the Silicon Island could prove very meaningful and impactful. This news also comes in the wake of Huawei using shell companies to deceive TSMC into manufacturing two million banned advanced AI compute chiplets for the company. Hopefully, stricter government controls will prevent any similar mistakes in the future.

The move by Taiwan's democratically elected government, specifically the Taiwan Commerce Ministry, isn't particularly surprising, given the ongoing trade war sparked by concerns over the weaponization of cutting-edge technologies against Western allies. From now on, both Huawei and SMIC will need to obtain export permits from suppliers based in Taiwan to receive manufactured goods.

As entries on Taiwan's blacklist, Huawei and SMIC are nestled among entities such as the Taliban and al-Qaeda, as well as a smorgasbord of other companies and organizations hailing from pariah nations like Iran, Russia, Afghanistan, and North Korea. According to sources like Bloomberg and Taiwan's CNA, neither the newly blacklisted Chinese companies nor Taiwan's economy ministry has shared comments on the new list.

Back in November, the U.S. requested that TSMC halt supplies of a range of advanced chips to Chinese customers. We also reported on a huge fine being levied upon TSMC for unknowingly supplying Huawei with two million compute chiplets for its Ascend 910-series AI processors. This weekend's updated entity list might have been precipitated by negotiations about such matters behind closed doors.

Taiwan is home not only to the most famous element of the silicon shield, TSMC, but also to a host of other key semiconductor firms working on everything from materials to advanced packaging. It isn't just TSMC products that may be cut off from Huawei and SMIC; exports from established industry players, such as UMC, ASE, SPIL, Nanya, and others, will also be subject to the new restrictions.

Countries that are supporting BEVs are those countries that have slip capacity to other fuels (renewable AND coal) and rare earth processing, just like those pushing for Hydrogen are those with alternative sourcing supply chains for biofuels and coal, and those pushing for continued ICE usage have plenty of access to oil.

It's always worth being sceptical about some of these claims about processes magically being carbon net negative since cleaning up the atmosphere might not actually be what's paying the bills leading to inherent conflicts between selling a product (ethanol) and doing an environmental service. Switching to EVs will allow you to use much less land to fuel the cars with wind or solar energy and then the leftover land can be used for carbon sequestration and rewilding/biodiversity projects where that's the sole focus of the operation.

In reality "evil" people almost always want to genuinely make the world a better place, and they are fighting "ignorant" people who are dragging society down by not conforming to their golden vision. And then "evil" becomes largely a function of who you ask.There are very few leaders ever who are straight up storybook style evil. Almost all of them were/are deranged people who convinced enough people of their ostensibly good vision to begin executing it.No one came to power because they wanted to turn society into burning rumble while they ate babies during daily random execution time. It's all nuance and complication.

The world, at the highest levels of competition and leadership, doesn't run on morals, it runs on unscrupulous force, conquest and domination. See: the human history for the past infinity years.

Reminder - Iran offered support after 9/11 but instead we rebuffed them and called them part of the axis of evil just because. Right at a time when they were really modernizing again but our jingoistic attitudes entrenched the autocrats further.They agreed to a nuclear deal that we tore up just because.We overthrew their government.We have presidential candidates singing “bomb bomb bomb Iran” for fun.The reason we have a bad relationship with Iran and a large reason why they have bad leaders is because the US has made it so.

For some reason I have been fixated on license plate readers (probably not a bad parallel to Palantir?). Plenty of people on HN justifiably decry license plate readers due to their violation of our privacy (to be sure there's an argument to made though since you are technically "in public" when driving — your privacy protections might be on shaky legal grounds).But if license plate readers are already a reality (we know they are), why should only private actors have that data? This would make sense if we completely trusted those private actors, of course.The opposite could be a public, open-source license plate reader that caught on (people using dash cams + open software) — the data sent to a collective, public database. (Perhaps the software strips out personal license plates — only logging tags of official or government vehicles?).My first reaction is the degree to which that could be abused by ... stalkers? Truly a bad thing. But then I ask myself to what degree the private license plate readers are perhaps "being abused" (or will be more and more) and we don't even know about it.As I say, a thought experiment that I find myself seeing merits both for and against.

I'm not sure if you consider governments and police to be private actors?I spoke with a sophisticated ANPR city-wide tracking vendor recently at a conference.  From their video showing the system following vehicles in real-time, with detailed movement tracking, speed measurement, lane position, estimating model, age, demographic etc. when they couldn't see the registration plate, from all sorts of vantage points, it looked to me like they would know where basically everyone who drives is at all times as they moved around.So, as a privacy advocate, I asked them about tracking and knowing where every driver is all the time, and they assured me: "It's ok.  We send all this data immediatel;y to the police.  The police are responsible for keeping the data safe.  They only use it when they decide it's appropriate."I was there interested in privacy and traffic monitoring, but there was almost nobody to speak with who seemed to think about privacy, except in a checkbox sort of way, e.g. "when you're in public there's no legal right to privacy" and "our systems are fully compliant with data protection".

I was taught many, many times growing up in the U.S. that people had a right to privacy, to free speech, to being considered innocent until proven guilty.When governmental organizations police the speech of individuals for things that are critical of the regime, we lose our right to free speech.When they download the contents of your phone when you travel, you lose the right to privacy.When people are denied a writ of habeas corpus, when they are trafficked to countries that are not from and have never been to, we are considered guilty unless we have people "on the outside" who are capable of fighting for our return.They aren't even trying to make an argument for this, outside of the cult of personality of the current regime, the belief that He can do no wrong. If you "both-sides" this you allow the trends to continue.

He was also proud of paying more for some kind of exclusive license to the data, that Floc wasn't going to sell his surveillance data to other entities. I never really believed that.

Closely related to this, I have been continually frustrated with the insistence of the left wing that it borders on immoral to take a job as a soldier, police officer, prison guard, or bailiff, and that there's no reason to raise any of their pay. That leaves the various armed forces around the country staffed with individuals who feel very little opposition to rote authoritarianism, corruption, and rule-by-force. There are relatively few individuals working in day-to-day policing or intelligence work that spend a lot of time thinking about the duty of agents of the state to follow its laws.

And yes, it's immoral to become a cop, just as it was immoral to become a european camp guard in the forties. There might be some mitigating factor like efficiently using it for infiltration and subversion because you didn't understand the morality of it until you were already employed, or being threatened into such a position.

Absolute wild take. Do you think every police department in the US oppresses minorities and infringes on civil rights or something?>just as it was immoral to become a european camp guard in the fortiesEven for the Allies? Given the prior sentence, I can't tell whether you're trying to allude to Nazi concentration camp guards, or actually think all camp guards are immoral.

There are some people who not only believe this but can make very compelling cases that this is the case. It's a dead-end rhetorical argument; yes, it is actually possible for literally every precinct in the US to violate people's civil rights.The difference is that some people, like (I suspect) the person you're responding to, seem to think that the position itself--armed law enforcement officer--is archetypically immoral and should not exist as a function or profession in a civilization. This is naive to to the point of absurdity and underwrites most of the idiocy that's widely abound in anti-policing movements. In one breath they claim that "police" are as a class immoral, and in the next they proclaim that their political opponents must be "brought to justice" by armed people following a set of written laws. It's absurd!

This was one of the first iterations of the legendary Steam Deck.

A YouTube creator has been able to get their hands on an early Steam Deck prototype (engineering sample 34) and disassembled it on camera to show off its clean internal layout. X (formerly Twitter) user SadlyItsDadley lent the unit to Jon Bringus of Bringus Studios, saying, “…he was easily the best person to archive this piece of gaming history.”

Once it was in his hands, Bringus set about stripping the cover off the Steam Deck evaluation unit on his YouTube channel. Interestingly, the device came with a piece of paper marked as “POC2-34 Control 163”, signifying that the console he had in his hands was indeed proof-of-concept number 34. Aside from exploring it physically, Jon also tried running some games on the handheld, showing us how far Valve has come since it first started toying with the idea of a portable Steam gaming console.

The external look of this evaluation unit is a bit different from the Steam Deck that we know and love today. For one, its touchpads are huge circles, a far cry from the cleaner rectangular units found on the current console. Its dual joysticks are also much smaller than what we're used to, and the contoured palm rests are a bit different on the experimental unit. Its BIOS indicated that this model was packing an AMD Ryzen 7 3700U and 8GB of RAM. It also came with a 256GB SSD and an Intel Wi-Fi chip, plus the system said that it had discrete GPU support (although Bringus wasn't able to test this capability).

The YouTuber copied the original SSD to another one to maintain its integrity. He inserted the imaged drive, and to his surprise, it contained an early version of SteamOS with three pre-installed accounts. Unfortunately, he can't access the seemingly official ‘34' account, which corresponds with the device's POC number. Furthermore, the SteamOS on the unit was built on September 30, 2020 — about a year and a half before the Steam Deck went on sale, roughly showing us at what part of the development cycle this particular sample existed.

Valve launched a renaissance in handheld gaming consoles with the Steam Deck. Although Nintendo established the groundwork for the 'default' modern mainstream gaming handheld form factor in 2017 with the Switch, it was the popularity of the Steam Deck that caught the attention of major PC hardware manufacturers. Because of this, these companies realized that there were a good number of people who wanted to play PC games on the go, resulting in the birth of competing hardware like the Asus ROG Ally family, the Lenovo Legion Go series, the MSI Claw line of handhelds, and many more.

There's a lot of superpowered characters in Superman, and one of the most notable is Michael Holt, aka Mr. Terrific. It isn't just that this is his first time on the big screen, it's also the matter of who's playing him: Edi Gathegi, who many likely remember as Darwin from X-Men: First Class, aka the mutant who died despite having the power to evolve and adapt to anything.

Sooner or later, conversations about First Class remind you how dumb his death was, and Gathegi seems to agree. Talking to Entertainment Weekly, he noted the character's death “is just a case of bad representation and missed opportunity.” The actor explained that he wasn't put off by dying given Darwin's power (and superheroes dying on a regular basis), and hoped to return in later movies. But with each passing sequel, those chances became less likely, hence him calling it “misrepresentation and missed opportunity.”

In Gathegi's eyes, getting to suit up again in Superman as Terrific is a way of “undoing the wrongs of Darwin,” and a role he's excited to inhabit.He's previously described the hero as “an atheist who believes in justice,” which is informed by Holt losing his wife in a car crash. Following her death, Holt “found meaning in knowledge and saw that while the universe might be cruel, intelligence, science, and innovation could make it better. He chose to become hope rather than succumbing to the despair of losing his wife.”

After Superman releases on July 11, Mr. Terrific is expected to appear in future DC projects. Gathegi's not saying which, but we already can't wait to see him again.

Impacts most, if not all, CPUs from Zen+ through Zen 5 architectures.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Board partners are now rolling out freshly baked BIOS updates based on AMD's AGESA 1.2.0.3e firmware. The updates are designed to patch a security flaw that could allow hackers to read sensitive data stored within the TPM (Trusted Platform Module), via VideoCardz. At least for some manufacturers, this BIOS update is a one-way street; you cannot roll back to an older release once you install it.

Hackers can exploit this security flaw by triggering an out-of-bounds read beyond the TPM2.0 routine. By doing so, these unauthorized users can gain access to sensitive data or disrupt the TPM's functionality as a whole. This stems from a bug (CVE-2025-2884), ranked 6.6 (Medium) on the CVSS scale, in TPM2.0's Module Library, which refers to standardized code that TPM 2.0 chips use for various functions.

While the AGESA 1.2.0.3e firmware only targets AM5-based processors, the security bug it addresses impacts a much wider range of AMD CPUs. Hence, it's best to consult the official security bulletin to determine if a mitigation is available for your processor. What makes this particular bug concerning is its accessibility, since it can be exploited using standard user-mode privileges, meaning an attacker doesn't need kernel-level access. This is a significant difference from previous vulnerabilities, including one that could execute unsigned microcode but required kernel-level access.

Impacted processors include a wide range of Ryzen processors between Athlon 3000 "Dali" / Ryzen 3000 "Matisse" and Ryzen 9000 "Granite Ridge" on desktop, and between Ryzen 3000 Mobile "Picasso", and Ryzen AI 300 "Strix Point" on mobile. Similarly, all workstation CPUs from Threadripper 3000 "Castle Peak" to Threadripper 7000 "Storm Peak" are also vulnerable to this bug. That being said, patches for most of these processors have been deployed across different timelines in the past few months. AM5-based CPUs are the most recent and are the latest to receive the update.

Several motherboard partners, including Asus and MSI, have started to roll out BIOS updates based on the new AGESA 1.2.0.3e firmware. In addition to fixing the aforementioned TPM flaw, this firmware also adds support for a new and upcoming Ryzen CPU, likely alluding to Ryzen 9000F series processors. It is best to consult your motherboard vendor's support page to see if a new BIOS is available, and update accordingly.

Accidental nostalgia hit from the Windows camp coincides with the unveiling of Apple's Vista-like UI for macOS 26 Tahoe.

A Windows bug-finding enthusiast has highlighted that the latest Insider Build in the Windows 11 Beta and Dev channels plays the Windows Vista startup sound as it boots to the desktop. However, Xeno's observation wasn't of an intentional slice of nostalgia aimed at the long-suffering Insiders. Microsoft Senior Program Manager on the Windows Insider Program Team, Brandon LeBlanc, admitted it was “an actual bug” after a bit of joking around.

The latest Windows 11 Insider Preview Build is 26200.5651 (Dev Channel) and the timing of its release coincides with Xeno's initial Tweet. This OS preview was heralded as bringing features such as new Copilot+ PC experiences, a new Recall export function, a bigger clock/calendar in the notification center, and more.

If the Microsoft exec's statement is correct, no one intended to change the default startup chime to the one used across the Windows Vista and Windows 7 eras. So the surprising retro refrain is an actual ‘known issue' in the latest flight.

It's an actual bug.June 13, 2025

Other Twitter/X users jumped in on the initial post by Xeno that highlighted the incongruous startup sound. At one point LeBlanc joked that the ‘issue' was precipitated after he “went in and had some fun with the sound files in Windows and thought folks needed a blast from the past.”

It was then suggested the Windows 95 startup sound would be a good choice for the impending 30th anniversary of its launch (August 24). But LeBlanc continued to make mirth, stating he couldn't find that correct .WAV file for that OS release. With his official responsibility as a Microsoft exec in mind, LeBlanc must have felt it necessary to then make clear he was joking, and the startup sound mix-up was “an actual bug.”

The timing of the above Windows snafu is almost comical, with Apple under criticism for unintentionally (?) reviving the glassy Windows Aero aesthetic with its latest macOS 26 Tahoe release. This OS will be the final one to support the aging fleet of Intel Macs that are still in use.

Only one of the RTX 4090s is legit

A Chinese hardware repair YouTuber received four allegedly faulty RTX 4090 graphics cards that needed repairing. The YouTuber discovered that three of the four cards were fake graphics cards modded from RTX 3090s and RTX 3080s to look like the real deal. The three fake cards had to be scrapped since they were apparently incapable of running. The customer of the four GPUs apparently paid $1,394 (10,000 yuan) for each GPU and purchased all four from an overseas vendor or supplier.

The Chinese repair YouTuber shared key insights to detect fake RTX 4090s. For starters, the QR code on every legitimate RTX 4090 is located on the very bottom left corner of the GPU substrate. On legitimate RTX 3090s and RTX 3080s, the QR code is located in the same area but slightly above the bottom left corner of the substrate. Most modders will allegedly not move the QR code of a GPU die they are trying to make look like another one, making this an easy way to verify whether an RTX 4090 is real.

the next level of the 4090 scam.according to 张哥,this time the surrounding mlcc position is correct, the qr code position is also correct.however the color of the PCB substrate is too fake, and the metal frame on the substrate is not fully attached.bilibili 修电脑的张哥… pic.twitter.com/tnQMBs8zOeJune 14, 2025

Additionally, RTX 30 series GPUs have a capacitor on the top right of the substrate that allegedly protrudes up a little bit; by contrast, the RTX 4090 does not.

As previously mentioned, three of the four RTX 4090s were faulty, featuring RTX 30 series GPU dies with modified laser engravings designed to deceive users into believing they were genuine RTX 4090s. The first one featured a QR code in the wrong area and fake VRAM, according to the YouTuber. The second GPU sported a scarred "AD102" die with the same QR code issue as the first card. The third GPU was by far the worst, sporting an abnormal green substrate and a substrate plate that was skinnier than the same plate on a real RTX 4090. The substrate plate was in such bad shape that the frame wasn't fully seated onto the substrate itself.

Only one of the RTX 4090s was real, featuring legitimate damage that needed to be fixed. The YouTuber discovered that some of the GDDR6X chips and some of the capacitors on the back of the board were bad. After replacing two of the faulty GDDR6X chips with new ones and fixing the rear capacitors, the card sprang to life and ran stably with no issues.

Selling counterfeit RTX 4090 graphics cards is sadly a common practice in today's GPU market. Thanks to the incredible value and high demand of Nvidia's previous-gen flagship, criminals can profit from stripping an old RTX 30-series graphics card and modifying it to look like an RTX 4090. Nvidia's Ampere-based GA102 die and memory configuration are similar enough to those of the AD102 GPUs that it can be easy to fake one to look like the other. However, it doesn't always have to be a GA102 chip; scams have also been seen where an RTX 4080 is falsely listed as an RTX 4090.

Thankfully, there have not been any major reports of fake RTX 5090s in the wild. But with how high the demand and how expensive the RTX 5090 is, it seems inevitable that modders will figure out how to sell fake RTX 5090s in the future as well.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

Kind of like Lord of the Rings, what is the best mattress out there to rule them all? Typically, as a professional mattress tester of over five years, I'd tell you it differs from person to person. But there are always the rare few models that manage to pull off the near impossible for a mattress to accomplish: being a supportive and comfortable fit for anybody, regardless of build or sleeping position. The Nolah Evolution Hybrid is one of those mattresses, and one of the rare few near-perfect beds I've tested to date. Here's why.

A commonality among Nolah mattresses is the use of something called AirFoam, which Nolah created to improve on memory foam performance factors: pressure relief, support, and durability. AirFoam is also meant to sleep cooler, since sucking in body heat is a known problem with memory foam. Can I prove that these things are actually at play when I sleep on a mattress? Scientifically, no—I can't necessarily break out the beakers in the bedroom. But what I can tell you is that the model I regularly use, the luxury firm, does a swell job with pressure relief and lumbar support.

This mattress's full government name used to be the “Nolah Evolution 15,” with the number denoting the full height of the mattress. It's definitely a taller mattress, and I use a frame lower to the ground to accommodate that (and my dogs' smaller legs). The newer iterations of the Nolah Evolution have the upgrade option of throwing on a Glacio-Tex-covered pillow top, which from other Nolah models I can tell you is very much cool to the touch. The standard pillow top's organic cotton cover (which I have the most experience with) is breathable, but it isn't going to give you that refrigerator-opening-blast-in-the-face coolness. The pillow top is your first pass at getting pressure relief from the mattress, and it lets the heavier areas of your body sink in a bit so they're not chafing against the mattress. So, side sleepers, pay attention to what I'm saying here. It's our top-tested pick for y'all for a reason!

However, the pillow top isn't doing all the heavy lifting for temperature control and pressure relief. A “Heat Escape Gusset” encircles the pillow top, which is essentially just mesh that is supposed to let heat escape from within the pillow top. After the pillow top comes the “Zoned AirFoam HD” layer—a fancy way of saying that this layer is for advanced pressure relief due to both the foam structure and perforation.

These holes allow the hips and shoulders to get a generally softer feel, while a firmer one is upheld right under where your spine curves. A 2-inch layer of comfort foam follows for—you guessed it—more pressure relief, along with a transition layer protecting the foam from the coil core. The coils are pocketed, allowing each one to react to your body instead of making it a group project like traditional innerspring beds of old. They're also reinforced in the center and along the edges, which is just an extra-firm feel to keep these particular areas extra-supported. Lastly, everything is set up on a foam base, which lets the coils really do their thing without being compressed by contact with your bed frame.

OK, enough shop talk. Here's what I like from testing this mattress. I remember when Nolah first launched the Evolution back in 2020, and it was touted as a good option for side sleepers with all the pressure relief and lumbar support features. When I eventually tried it (and various iterations afterward), it consistently delivered on these marks. Something that has always stood out to me as a major value add was the three firmness options available: plush, luxury firm, and firm. Having a variety of firmnesses is an easy way to make a mattress more accessible to all kinds of sleepers, especially with different body types and sleeping positions.

I landed on “luxury firm” for a couple of reasons, chief among them being that I'm part of a dynamic sleeping duo. In other words, my husband is a back sleeper, and I'm a stomach sleeper (who is desperately trying to be a side sleeper, mind you). All to say, these sleeping positions can require different firmness levels for adequate support, preferences not even being factored in. Luxury firm is the middle ground, and we've found it to be a welcoming amount of softness that doesn't cancel out the feeling of support.

While I'm on my side, my hips and shoulders get hugged, and if I'm on my stomach, my lower back stays lifted. Everything remains relatively on the same level—hips, lower back, and shoulders—which is what you want for even spine alignment. When on your back, your spine curves away from the bed, but the pillow top takes up that space nicely. That way your back doesn't feel like it's being left out support-wise, and this eliminates a potential cause of back pain.

I do pick up on some rocking if my husband moves around in his sleep, which isn't ideal, but it's not the most disruptive I've ever tested. I'm often relegated to the very edge of the mattress while my dogs stretch out (a mother's sacrifice, I tell you). The reinforced coils are fine for supporting you while lying down, and your weight is evenly distributed across them. Sitting is a whole other ball game, especially if you're like me and sit at the foot to put on your socks.

And cooling—let's talk about that. Granted, I've only ever tested versions with the organic cotton cover, as the new and improved Glacio-Tex cover is a new development. Even with the AirFoam and heat escape gusset at play, it stays at room temperature. This is fine for my needs, but I make sure to use cooling sheets and keep the fan running. If you're a hot sleeper by nature, or have medical conditions like POTS or menopause and really need that cool-feeling mattress, you may need to go all in on the upgraded pillow top.

A small detail that I must highlight as well is that the mattress has handles. Shockingly, this is pretty rare in the online mattress space—at least in the models I've tested in my time. They're located on the sides and have been very handy (pun intended) for when I rotate my mattress every few months.

The highest compliment a mattress could get from a longtime mattress reviewer isn't just a good review. It's going so far as to get the mattress for themselves. And if you haven't picked up on it by now, I have the Nolah Evolution hybrid at home. I also recommend it to friends and family, and if you see it in our guides, know it was probably me pushing to add it as a recommendation.

Now, goodbye for now, and excuse me while I swan dive into my bed for a nap.

The saying goes that a dog is a man's best friend, but an archaeological excavation in Norway proves that women care about their four-legged companions just as much as men do, even 1,100 years ago.

Archaeologists from the Arctic University Museum of Norway have revealed a 10th-century Viking boat grave on the Norwegian island of Senja. The buried individual is likely a woman who belonged to an elite class, as Science Norway first reported. Most notably, the team found a dog carefully buried at her feet.

“It appears to have been placed with real care,” Anja Roth Niemi, a museum archaeologist who presumably took part in the excavation, told Science Norway. “There are stories of prominent people doing everything in their power when their dog became ill. So even back then, people had deep bonds with their animals.”

A metal detectorist first discovered brooches and bone remains at the site just 7.9 inches (20 centimeters) beneath the ground two years ago. Suspecting the presence of a Viking woman's burial, the Arctic University Museum of Norway applied for permission to investigate and were finally able to conduct a proper excavation when the landowner decided to expand a garage on the property.

“After the upper layer of soil was removed, it became clear that this was a boat grave,” the museum wrote in a social media post. “The decayed wood from the boat was visible as a thin dark strip in the subsoil, with the site where the bowl brooches were found approximately in the middle.”

The work revealed a 17.7-foot-long (5.4-meter) boat in which a Viking woman and a dog were buried alongside objects associated with elite burials, including bone or amber beads, a pendant, and ornate brooches, according to Science Norway. This is not the first time archaeologists have found dog remains alongside Viking ones, but it provides further proof that dogs were prized companions even 1,100 years ago.

The brooches' design—oval with silver thread—helped the team date the grave to approximately 900 to 950 CE, as reported by Science Norway. They also indicate that the buried individual was a woman, given that oval brooches were usually Viking women's jewelry, though only bone analysis can confirm this beyond a doubt. Furthermore, the boat grave and grave goods altogether suggest that the woman was a high-class individual.

“Only the elite would receive a burial like this,” Niemi told Science Norway. Niemi and her colleagues also uncovered agricultural tools and textile instruments, the latter of which further associate the burial with Viking womanhood. Further analyses will confirm the individual's sex and shed light on her age, height, diet, and health, while also offering more insight into Viking burial traditions. Moreover, after discovering another brooch not too far from the burial, the archaeologists hope to continue investigating the area in the hopes of finding another grave.

According to the museum's post, the last days of the excavation were spent “recording all the contents of the grave and securing them for transport and storage until they can be examined in detail under controlled conditions at the laboratory in Tromsø.”

It is my hope that they keep the woman and her pet together in Tromsø, so that the dog can continue guarding its owner in the afterlife as it likely did when they were both alive.

Rare Ampere-era GPU highlights a memory-boosted variant that never hit the market

A rare engineering sample of the Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition with 20GB of VRAM was recently sold in an auction on eBay. This specific variant never managed to reach retail, thus making it one of the most unusual Ampere-era GPUs to surface online. According to the listing, the auction concluded with the buyer offering $1,999, which is pretty wild for a high-end graphics card that is two-generations old.

The seller included photos of the GPU, showing the original packaging box and a bright green sticker on the GPU that reads, “Not for sale, for development only.” The seller also confirmed that the unit is in excellent condition and fully functional. However, since it is not a retail product, running games or any 3D workloads would require the use of a third-party driver such as Nvidia-patcher, as there are no official drivers available for this card. This could potentially translate to poor or unstable performance, although that remains unconfirmed.

The retail version of the RTX 3080 Ti made its official debut in June 2021 with a starting price of $1,199. It featured 12GB of GDDR6X memory and was essentially an RTX 3090 with half the VRAM and a smaller cooling solution. Introduced midway through Nvidia's regular product cycle, it offered higher specifications and performance compared to the RTX 3080.

The first rumors of a 20GB RTX 3080 Ti sparked back in December 2020 when a Gigabyte EEC listing revealed several RTX 3080 Ti 20GB models. This was followed by a firmware anonymously uploaded to TechPowerUp, meant specifically for Gigabyte's range of RTX 3080 Ti 20GB GPUs.

Eventually, in September 2021, a few months after the official launch of the RTX 3080 Ti, a cryptocurrency miner revealed in a YouTube video that retailers in Russia were selling Gigabyte branded RTX 3080 Ti 20GB GPUs ranging from $2,733 to $2,837. The individual managed to get hold of a rare Gigabyte Aorus GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Xtreme (GV-N308TAORUS X-20GD), which was purchased from HARDVAR, a retail store in Saint Petersburg. At the time of posting the video, the GPU was priced at $3,067.

The video also revealed that the only difference between the two GeForce RTX 3080 Ti models was the memory capacity. The 20GB variant offered a 67% increase in GDDR6X memory compared to the standard 12GB version. However, the higher memory model came with a narrower 320-bit memory bus instead of 384-bit. As a result, the 20GB model had lower memory bandwidth of 760 GBps compared to 912 GBps on the 12GB version.

It is possible that the RTX 3080 Ti 20GB was planned as a counter to AMD's high-VRAM Radeon offerings at the time. Perhaps it was intended to target users who prioritized memory capacity for gaming, crypto, or creative workloads. Whether Nvidia changed its mind due to production constraints, shifting strategy, or overlapping performance tiers, this unreleased GPU will likely go on to become a "what-if" in Nvidia's Ampere lineup.

This maker built a drone from scratch with no experience.

Tsung Xu, an engineer, has designed and manufactured a 3D-printed winged VTOL drone capable of flying for 130 continuous miles (approximately 3 hours) and posted an article and YouTube video (embedded below) detailing his efforts.

According to Xu, everything accomplished in this project was done without any prior knowledge of aerodynamic modeling, 3D printing, or CAD, and the process took 90 days. He outlined the project's progression in a log here.

Everything you see in this drone was designed and put together by Xu from scratch. Many of the components had to be modeled before they could be printed, as this design wasn't based on an existing plane. Xu confirms in the project details that the drone was printed using a Bambu Lab A1 printer, a device we gave 4.5 out of 5 stars to when reviewing.

It should go without saying that certain components, like the radio and motors, were sourced separately. When testing the setup, Xu stated that he was able to achieve a maximum flight time of approximately 3 hours, which translates to roughly 130 miles of flying time. This was made possible thanks to the integration of what Xu describes as a high energy density battery. No doubt the model design plays a factor in this performance, though, as well.

Unfortunately, we don't get an in-depth look at the build process. However, Xu assures us that the building of this winged VTOL drone was only made possible thanks to a handful of unique challenges. This ranged from things like taking the time to understand aerodynamic design to sourcing electrical components.

Earlier this week, we reported that the US Army is planning to implement more 3D printing and drone support in its tactical strategies, so it's neat to see the impact of the two fields (3D printing and FPV drones) on both an industrial scale and on an individual basis.

The Beats Solo 4 has received a fantastic 4.6 out of 5 stars based on more than 12,000 reviews and proves widespread satisfaction among customers. This type of endorsement speaks volumes about the quality and reliability of the product and not to mention the extremely high standards of both Beats and Apple. Although these headphones do not possess active noise cancellation per se, they instead offer personalized spatial audio with dynamic head tracking which is actually a superior feature and a whole new level to your listening.

The unique acoustic design and new drivers generate well-balanced sound characteristic of the Beats brand. The ultralight, ergonomic design is comfortable all day, thanks to a flex-grip headband and ergonomically angled and adjustable ear cups that create a solid fit. The UltraPlush cushions are contoured for comfort and endurance so they can be worn for hours on end without irritation.

Perhaps one of the strongest advantages of the Beats Solo 4 is its amazing battery life: With up to 50 hours of playback per single charge, you can listen to these headphones for days without needing to plug them in. Even when you do exhaust the battery, Fast Fuel technology offers just 10 minutes of charging gives you up to 5 hours of playback time. Audiophiles will like the choice of listening in high-resolution lossless audio—delivered over USB-C or a 3.5 mm audio cable—so you're always listening at the best possible level.

These headphones are completely compatible with both iOS and Android and offer one-touch pairing for easy and hassle-free setup. High-quality call clarity is provided by the onboard microphone and also allows easy communication with voice assistants and keeps you connected and productive on the move.

The current price point of $99 is a rare commodity, and it matches the lowest price points during massive shopping sales like Black Friday. Make sure you get it before it runs out of stok.

When legendary game designer Hideo Kojima announced to the world that Death Stranding 2 would soon be released, he made it known that Covid-19 had completely changed his idea for this sequel.

“We released Death Stranding before the Covid-19 pandemic, when the world was moving toward isolation and division—as with Brexit. The idea behind it was ‘Let's connect. We'll face disaster if we don't connect.' The theme, the story, and the gameplay of the first chapter all revolved around that idea,” Kojima tells WIRED. “After the release, just three months later, a pandemic broke out, and I was very surprised. It really felt like Death Stranding, in a way.”

WIRED headed to Tokyo in April for a long and comprehensive preview of the game and asked Kojima about all the secrets behind Death Stranding 2's creation. The game is set to be released June 26 and will be available on PlayStation.

“In the real world, in the 21st century, we have something similar to the Chiral Network—the internet. It was different than, for example, the Spanish flu pandemic a century earlier. We survived the pandemic because of the internet and the fact that people were about to connect online. Now there are people who work for our studio from home and whose faces I don't even know. Live concerts were canceled, and everything moved to online streaming. I understand that it was inevitable during the pandemic. It was the same with school. Instead of playing with friends or learning from teachers, you watched a screen, as if you were watching a YouTube video.

“Everything was converging toward the metaverse. You'd turn on the TV and everyone was talking about how we were now in the metaverse era, where there was no need to physically interact with people. I thought we were going in the wrong direction. Communication between human beings shouldn't be like that. You meet people by chance and see unexpected things. With the path we were on, all of that would be lost.”

As Kojima explains, the initial concept for Death Stranding 2 was very different, and even his idea of connections between people changed after the pandemic: “I already had an idea for Death Stranding 2 before the pandemic,” he says, “but after going through that experience I felt something wasn't right, and I rewrote it.”

“The strangest thing was that after creating a game with the theme ‘let's connect instead of isolating,' the pandemic came along, and I started thinking, ‘Maybe connecting so much is not such a good thing.' So we went back to the stick-and-rope theory [from Death Stranding] again. There is a lot of anticipation of that theme in the game, and I'm sure many people will understand what I meant by coming to the end of the experience. For example, there's a character who will express the same feelings that I felt during the pandemic.”

“In the logo of the first Death Stranding, the strands started from the bottom, and the general theme was ‘let's connect.' In Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, however, the strands in the logo come down from the top and are somewhat reminiscent of [the puppeteer's strings from] the Godfather logo. Even within the game, you will see threads that start from many people and go upward, like Dollman and the robotic soldiers. These are all clues. When you really start to think about what it means to connect, you start to ask questions. But that's all I'll say for now. Play the game when it comes out in June to learn more!”

“I know everyone experienced the pandemic, so I think certain feelings will seem familiar to many, although I can't be totally sure. I'm not saying the metaverse is evil, but you have come all this way and played the game for four days. Today, something like that would normally only happen online.”

“This game, however, is about connections. You'll understand it better as you progress through Death Stranding 2; I think you'll start to feel it after a while. That's why we invited you to come here physically, despite your busy schedules. People from all over the world have gathered here in our studios, meeting each other and starting conversations. You have seen the view from Tokyo Station, or maybe you've wandered into a random restaurant. These things are part of the human experience. These coincidences and unintended events tie together naturally, but none of this exists in the metaverse.”

Elle Fanning's character in Death Stranding 2

In Death Stranding 2: On the Beach the gameplay is much more action-oriented. The player can choose to fight much more often than in the first part, although it's not required. If the first chapter often tried to avoid firefights, almost punishing those who killed enemies, something has also changed in terms of this when it comes to the sequel, Kojima says.

“I've talked about the ‘we shouldn't have connected' theme before, and I've also told you about the stick-and-rope theory in Death Stranding in the past. Today, even though the world is connected via a rope, which we know as the online world, people still play games where they use the ‘stick,' shooting each other. That's why I wanted to create a game where you use a rope above all else, and that was Death Stranding.

“There are so many conflicts in the world today. In the end, connecting with the rope isn't the solution to everything. Higgs [Monaghan] will tell you something similar in the game: to connect, you also need a stick. The further you go into the game, the better you will understand what Higgs means. That's one of the reasons I said ‘we shouldn't have connected,' and it's not just about the game aspect, it's also a reflection on a social level.”

Among the many important themes in the game are those related to loss and mourning, and Kojima reveals that the inspiration to include them also partly stems from personal experiences: “It comes from within, so I'd say it's half based on real experiences I've had and half from fiction. It comes from a very intimate place, from thoughts like a sense of loneliness, the mystery of where the dead go, and the pain of not having had a true goodbye with someone we have lost.”

Transportation in Death Stranding 2

The new Death Stranding expands and improves on every element of the game's first installment. Kojima says the transition from PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 5 means most changes focused on game design and story.

“I hope you remember the first Metal Gear Solid, where you really had to concentrate on infiltration, otherwise it was ‘game over.' At the beginning of the game, before you got to the lift, you had no weapons, but once you got past that part, you could get access to some. The reason I had done this was that if I had put a weapon there from the beginning, players would have used it to eliminate enemies. It would no longer have been a ‘stealth' game. That's why I deliberately removed it, but many hated that choice and many couldn't even get to the lift.

“In the first Metal Gear Solid we included a lot of mechanics to teach what stealth was. So for MGS 2, I knew that people now understood the concept better, and so I made the weapons more accessible. You could even target specific body parts of enemies.”

Fighting in Death Stranding 2

In fact, all of Metal Gear can be considered an increasingly exponential and often experimental evolution (such as the open world of the fifth chapter) of the formula born with the saga's historic progenitor. The Death Stranding saga seems to be following a similar evolution: “For Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, I used the same approach. At the beginning it was a game focused on deliveries, something no one had ever seen before, so some people might feel frustrated by that.

“But now the public is familiar with the idea, so I wanted to give players more freedom, even those who want to fight, for example. Now you can use weapons—you can, but it's not compulsory. You can use vehicles and motorbikes. Everything is more accessible in this second installment. It's still a delivery game, but I wanted to offer more freedom in terms of game mechanics—that was the goal.”

This freedom is also reflected in the combat. Indeed, the game is now much more focused on firefights, but the main thing was, above all else, the ability to give players a choice in how they approach the various missions—something that doesn't force them to fight at all costs: “Well, I don't want to suggest to people that they focus on combat or anything like that, but there are a lot of players all over the world asking me to make another Metal Gear, so here too I added more options for combat.”

“This, however, is still a game focused primarily on deliveries. You can avoid enemies by taking a longer ride around the map or by quickly passing a vehicle or motorbike through an encampment, or you can fight them. I wanted the choice to be up to the player. In case he chooses combat, we had to change the design of the weapons to make them easier to use. When we were working on these mechanics, I was a little worried, because many of the team members who worked with me on Metal Gear still work with me, and we kept asking ourselves, ‘Does this feel too Metal Gear?' but we didn't do it deliberately.”

This freer approach was also shared by his colleagues: Yoji Shinkawa, art director of character and mechanical design, who has worked with Kojima since Metal Gear Solid; Hirohaki Yoshiike, lead level designer; Takayuki Uchida, technical art director, lead environment artist; and, finally, Akio Sakamoto, chief technology officer, technical director.

Whether in exploration, combat, or stealth, the development team's approach has always been to provide the player with the tools to act as he or she prefers, which is why over the years they have focused heavily on improving gunfights and stealth, incorporating new weapons, new mechanics and the ability to adapt Sam's character to each user's play style.

Death Stranding 2

Kojima says Mexico was a natural choice to continue the path that started with the first game, even though it wasn't his original plan: “In Death Stranding you connected the North American continent from east to west, mirroring the exploration of the American frontier. America already had the [United Cities of America], so for the sequel I wondered whether or not to use a similar setting. In the first idea I had, the player would have had to disconnect everything he had previously connected, because he would discover that these connections had been a big mistake. But I was not convinced, especially since I would have reused the exact same setting.”

The choice to use Australia as Plate Gate in the second chapter was because of its geographical features: a place that was not too large and which ran from east to west along an ocean was needed. This portal connecting the continents provides some interesting possibilities for sequels: “The concept of the Plate Gate would allow me to create infinite sequels! I obviously have no plans to do that, but I do have an idea in mind for one possible one. I don't think I will make it, but if I passed the project on to someone else, they probably could.”

Kojima says he decided to introduce a day/night cycle to give players the freedom to choose their favorite time of day to play, as it will be possible to change the time simply by sleeping in Sam's room. This choice, however, has led to some minor problems in the direction of the cutscenes, which are also managed in real time according to the time of day.

He mentions how important it is for him to analyze player behavior in his games, particularly with regard to the asynchronous multiplayer of the first Death Stranding, which allows players to share objects and constructions, such as bridges and ladders, with other users. Kojima is surprised by the success that the highways have had, and especially the fact that even today, five years after the launch of the first chapter, there are still people who continue to build and maintain them. He says he's not much of a construction guy, preferring to use simpler tools like ladders when playing.

Combat vehicles in Death Stranding 2

For players who are fans of this mechanic, however, he has added many elements in Death Stranding 2, such as the monorail, which is a new addition. He went on to explain the meaning of likes, which work very much like social media likes in the game: “A like is not a currency—you don't get any items or become stronger because of them. The team was very hesitant about adding them at first. They are closer to likes in the real world. They have no concrete value, but they make you feel good. From a game design point of view, it's strange. Normally you accumulate points and get a rank or rewards, but in our case the like is just a personal incentive. It's exactly like on social. I wanted to create something like that, and in the end, people seemed to enjoy it. I expected more criticism. Even the team, who were initially opposed, changed their minds.”

The first and now also the second Death Stranding unite the worlds of film and video games thanks to the presence of many famous actors. Kojima has said the criteria he uses to choose them is always based on the connections he has with people and their work.

Kojima says he usually contacts these stars personally and, on many occasions, including with Luca Marinelli, who plays Neil in the game, the actor or their agent turns out to be a fan of the game designer. “That is generally my selection process. I also audition, of course, but it's mostly a matter of connections. This also applies to Od, Physint, and other projects.”

Luca Marinelli's character in Death Stranding 2

“I have already mentioned on several occasions that I saw the Italian film Martin Eden, with Luca Marinelli. It had a big impact on me. I may have seen it before the pandemic, but I wrote a commentary for the promotion of the film in Japan. After that, Luca sent me an email. He told me that he has been a fan of mine since his childhood and that he had read my comments. He asked the distributor for my contact details, and we got to know each other.”

“When I thought about involving him, I knew that his character had to surpass the one played by Mads Mikkelsen. I asked myself: ‘Is that possible?' Mads' character could not return in Death Stranding 2, and I knew some fans would be disappointed. I had to find someone who could go further. I remembered Luca, wrote to him directly, and offered him the role. He accepted immediately.”

Shooting for a video game, however, is not as simple as shooting a film, as Kojima tells us: “It's a job that requires a lot of strength, both physical and mental. Before shooting we have to scan the actor, decide on a hairstyle, makeup, and costumes and then create the digital data. And in order to record the scenes we have to coordinate everyone's schedules.

“Unlike a film, however, we can't shoot everything in three or four months, and we meet periodically during the development. It's a tiring process, both for us and for the actors. It's not a matter of three months and we're done. After that there is also the ADR [automatic dialog replacement, or dubbing], for example. Marinelli doesn't just appear in cutscenes. When the character appears as an NPC, you also have to record sounds, moans, breaths, grunts … and that part never seems to end. It's tough. And, of course, the actors are also working on other projects at the same time.

Death Stranding 2 also features Marinelli's wife, Alissa Jung: “I was also looking for someone to play Lucy, but in the midst of the pandemic it wasn't easy. One day, Luca asked me if I had found his ‘counterpart.' I told him no. He told me that his wife is an actor and also a director, so we met and I found her really brilliant, intelligent, perfect for the role of Lucy. We scanned them both at the height of the pandemic. Neil also has scenes with Norman, while Alissa, who plays Lucy, has mostly scenes with Luke. I can't say more, or I'll reveal some spoilers.”

The worlds in Death Stranding 2

Among Kojima's favorite scenes filmed for Death Stranding 2, he mentions one shot by Marinelli and Jung: “Luca, meanwhile, was filming the series Mussolini: Son of the Century, directed by Joe Wright. When I offered him the role he was beautiful, he looked like a young Alain Delon. But when I scanned him he had changed: I asked him what had happened. He replied: ‘I'm getting fat to play Mussolini.' We couldn't do much, so we scanned him as he was.

“A year later, at the time of motion capture, he had changed again. I thought: ‘Oh God, it's not the Luke I expected,' but we then solved it digitally. It was quite a problem, but what he shot is really good! Most of the scenes with Alissa and Luca are just between the two of them, and the interesting thing is that, because they are husband and wife in real life, they have an incredible chemistry.

“Luca comes from the theater, and Alissa is a director as well as an actor. Sometimes she tried to take over on the set too! We shot at the SIE studio in Los Angeles. It's a huge studio, almost like a big Hollywood set. Me and a couple of my staff went to manage the shoot, but there were many other people including technicians, makeup artists, and others. When Luca started acting, however, everyone came over to watch. This had never happened to me before.”

Kojima's games also impress with their beautiful soundtracks, and Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is no exception. One of the star artists of the new title is Woodkid, and the game director recounted that he met him by chance in Paris in 2020, when the artist wanted to introduce himself, being a fan of Kojima's, by playing one of his songs. Kojima was also struck by Woodkid's music videos, which have atmospheres like that of Death Stranding, and Kojima decided to contact him to have him work on some songs for the soundtrack of the second chapter.

The music was an important legacy to continue, especially after the passing of Ryan Karazija of Low Roar, whose musical style had profoundly marked the first chapter. Kojima explained that he had also included some unreleased Low Roar tracks in the new game, sent to him by the singer's family.

Kojima follows the same approach for the music in his games as he does for the choice of actors: “Just like for the casting of actors, I contact them directly: Sometimes I ask if I can use one of their songs, other times they offer to write a new one, and an exchange takes place.”

Many other artists contributed to the new game, such as Caroline Polachek, the Mongolian singer-songwriter Magnolian, and the Polish pianist Hania Rani. Each musical choice, the game designer explains, reflects his personal taste: a mix of different sensibilities that further enriches the atmosphere of the game.

At the end of our interview, Kojima talks about what was the most rewarding aspect of creating Death Stranding 2: On the Beach: “That's a difficult question. I wrote the concept for this game completely on my own, during the pandemic.

“Yoji [Shinkawa] would come by maybe once a week, but otherwise I worked without seeing anyone in person. It was a really tough time. Some people still worked from home. Yet, despite all the challenges, we're almost done now.

“During the pandemic I thought we would never make it. I think all the studios felt the same. We couldn't shoot anything, everything was at a standstill, and I wondered: ‘How can I make a game like this?' But, thanks to the support of so many people, we are now really close to the end. I think we started performance capture in 2021. At that time I couldn't go to Los Angeles to direct; the studio wouldn't allow it. It was like that for all the studios. So we had to do everything remotely. I was working from Tokyo and connected online with Los Angeles.

Sam and Lou in Death Stranding 2

“The actors obviously had to go to the studio, but I had to explain everything from a distance: ‘Stand here, walk there, do this...' It was very difficult. We used iPads and smartphones, but it didn't work very well. At one point I thought I was going crazy.

“Then an acquaintance of mine at Sony created something called Mado, which means window in Japanese. It's like a giant smartphone, a two-way monitor that almost looks like a door. If you stand in front of it, you can see inside the studio in Los Angeles. You see and hear everything in real time. Unfortunately you can't walk through to the other side but they lent us two of these devices and we managed to get the footage we needed. Even Norman got close to that ‘window.' It was difficult, but there was also something beautiful about the process.

“When you work in person, you can talk directly and change things on the spot. But remotely, you'll have a meeting every week or every month, and everything slows down. Sometimes you find out too late that someone was working on an idea that had already been rejected. I think all studios faced similar problems. So what was the most rewarding part? Simply the fact that we managed to go all the way and finish this game.”

When Superstorm Sandy made a beeline for New York City in October 2012, it flooded huge swaths of downtown Manhattan, leaving 2 million people without electricity and heat and damaging tens of thousands of homes. The storm followed a sweltering summer in New York City, with a procession of heat waves nearing 100 degrees.

For those who were pregnant at the time, enduring these extreme conditions wasn't just uncomfortable—it may have left a lasting imprint on their children's brains. That's according to a new study published on Wednesday in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS One. Using MRI scans, researchers at Queens College, City University of New York, found that children whose mothers lived through Superstorm Sandy had distinct brain differences that could hinder their emotional development. The effects were even more dramatic when people were exposed to extreme heat during their pregnancy, in addition to the tropical storm, the researchers found.

“It's not just one climate stressor or one isolated event, but rather a combination of everything,” said Donato DeIngeniis, the lead author of the study and a doctoral student in neuropsychology at the CUNY Graduate Center. DeIngeniis' study is the first of its kind to examine the joint effects of natural disasters and extreme heat—events that often coincide. A few years ago, scientists dubbed summer “danger season” since it's a time of colliding risks, including heat, hurricanes, wildfires, and toxic smoke. And summertime temperatures keep climbing to new heights.

The study analyzed brain imaging data from a group of 34 children, approximately 8 years old, whose mothers were pregnant during Superstorm Sandy—some of whom were pregnant at the time that Sandy made landfall, and some of whom were exposed to heat 95 degrees F or higher during their pregnancy. While the researchers didn't find that heat alone had much of an impact, living through Superstorm Sandy led to an increase in the basal ganglia's volume, a part of the brain that deals with regulating emotions.

While that larger size could be a compensation in response to stress, changes in the basal ganglia have been linked to behavioral challenges for children, such as depression and autism, DeIngeniis said.

“What we are seeing is compelling evidence that the climate crisis is not just an environmental emergency, it is potentially a neurological one with consequence for future generations who will inherit our planet,” said Duke Shereen, a co-author of the study and the director of the MRI facility at CUNY Graduate Center, in a press release. Global warming made Superstorm Sandy more damaging as a result of rising sea levels and higher ocean temperatures that might have amped up its rainfall.

Yoko Nomura, a co-author of the study and a psychology professor at the Queens College, CUNY, said that the time before birth is “very, very sensitive” for development because the fetus' body is changing so drastically. The human brain grows the most rapidly in the womb, reaching more than a third of its full adult volume before birth, according to the study. Any added stress at that time, even if small, “can have a much bigger impact,” Nomura said.

But that extra-sensitive period also presents a window of opportunity. “Developmental science, including the science in this paper, is exciting because it not only tells us what we can do to protect children from the effects of climate change, but it also tells us when we can step in to protect children to make the greatest difference,” Lindsey Burghardt, chief science officer at the Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University, said in an email.

Although there's a lot of evidence that prenatal stress generally can affect child brain development, according to DeIngeniis, research on climate-related stress specifically is lacking. “It is still a field that has potential for explosive growth,” said Jennifer Barkin, a professor at Mercer University School of Medicine in Macon, Georgia, who is studying the effects of last year's Hurricane Helene on maternal health.

DeIngeniis' study offers concrete evidence of how climate-charged events can affect the brain, Barkin said. “People have a hard time sometimes with mental health, because it's not like you can take an X-ray and see a broken bone.” But it's easier to understand imaging showing a difference in brain volume based on exposure to environmental stress, she said.

Barkin, who developed an index for measuring maternal health after childbirth, says that people are beginning to pay more attention to mothers and their mental health—not just in terms of delivering a healthy baby, but over the long term. “We tend to focus things on the child's outcome, which is important, but to keep the child healthy, the mother has to be healthy, too,” she said. “Because when Mom's struggling, the family's going to struggle.”

Here's a recent United States soccer story via the Associated Press:

Tyler Adams says the U.S. soccer team has tuned out criticism from former players.

Landon Donovan and Clint Dempsey, who share the American goals record with 57 each, are among those who have been critical of current regulars not in the struggling roster preparing for the CONCACAF Gold Cup.

“We don't talk about that internally as a group,” Adams said Wednesday during a Zoom interview with The Associated Press. “The noise on the outside is the noise on the outside. I think we need to focus on what we need to do as a group and continue to build.”

Star Christian Pulisic is skipping the June camp and Gold Cup to rest after playing about 120 games for club and country over two seasons.

“Whether it was Gold Cup, whether it was Copa (América), whether it was Confederations Cup, whether it was the World Cup, I wasn't going to miss competitions,” Dempsey said last week on the “Men in Blazers” podcast. “For me, I don't understand it because that wasn't my mentality. I always wanted to play in those games.”

Watching Portugal celebrate its win over Spain in Sunday's European Nations League final, Donovan said on the Fox postgame show: “I can't help but think about our guys on vacation not wanting to play in Gold Cup.”

Pulisic has not spoken publicly of his decision.

The U.S. has lost four straight games, its longest skid since 2007, following a 4-0 rout Tuesday night by Switzerland.

“This is part of the process,” Adams said. “You're going to win games. You're going to lose games. It's about continuing to build that. I think we're on the right path. We have to continue to build and try the things that we've been training. It'll take a little bit of time, but it will come together.”

Adams didn't dress for the Switzerland friendly but is confident he will be ready for the Gold Cup, where the Americans open Sunday against Trinidad and Tobago.

“A little turf toe-type injury. More of an overuse thing probably than anything — overload. It was something that I picked up when I came into camp,” Adams said. “Progressing well right now, but just trying to be smart and manage it.”

Adams, who captained the U.S. at the 2022 World Cup, funded a pair of mini-pitches at Pulaski Park in Poughkeepsie, New York, near his home in Wappinger. He spoke on the Zoom about his work with Allstate, the U.S. Soccer Foundation and Black Star Soccer to construct fields about the size of basketball courts at the Fisher Magnet Upper Academy in Detroit and The Bell Avenue School in Yeadon, Pennsylvania.

“Before the World Cup hopefully we plan to do one more with a city unnamed yet,” Adams said. “It's something that I think has real impact, continues to grow the sport, serves underserved communities.”

Now 26, Adams is feeling back to his old self. He had back surgery last July with Dr. Robert Watkins and returned to the field with England's Bournemouth on Oct. 26. Adams played in 28 Premier League matches this season after being limited to three in 2023-24 because of leg injuries.

“It's definitely enjoyable when you're healthy,” he said. “The 16-to-18 months that it was just on and off inconsistency is something I never had in my career and never had to battle. And then when it hits you and you go through that, you just learn different ways to navigate things, enjoy life, just not take things for granted, all the little things.”

Since Mauricio Pochettino took over as U.S. coach last fall, players have had more autonomy to break away from rigid positioning employed by his predecessor, Gregg Berhalter.

“From a positional standpoint, obviously we had probably a little bit of a different structure under Gregg,” Adams said. “Maurizio gives the players freedom to find spots they're comfortable in and see how they can affect the game in different ways. I think our attacking players definitely have freedom to try and find the ball and create things in the right areas of the field. So, yeah, I think he gives everyone freedom, but there's still structure to the way that we want to play.”

Adams will be with the U.S. team in Austin, Texas, next Wednesday, and following intently when the Premier League releases its 2025-26 schedule at 3 a.m. CDT. He feels improved because of his time with Leeds in 2022-23 and Bournemouth the past two seasons.

“After you play in the Premier League, every game feels slow,'” he said. “No matter what game I play in now the game feels slow. You look at your schedule when the season comes out and you have to play in a row Arsenal, Tottenham, Man City, Liverpool, Manchester United, all these big games back to back to back you just learn how to make decisions quicker and if you don't, you get punished.”

Club World Cup

live

Updated 59m ago

Bayern Munich have thrashed Auckland City 10-0 in Cincinnati in the first match of day two at the 2025 Club World Cup. 

The Group C clash pitted one of the true heavyweights of the tournament against the smallest club, with the German side unsurprisingly dominating. 

Kingsley Coman had a hat-trick, Michael Olise, Jamal Musiala and Thomas Muller each scored twice and Sacha Boey got the other. 

Highlights will be available on The Athletic.

Lots of people watching that 10-0 win for Bayern making the same observation: there is a real chance we will similar mismatches at next summer's World Cup.

The expansion from 32 teams to 48 means that some less accomplished nations are getting the chance to compete and that could spell problems, like the ones we have just seen for Auckland City.

Will 48 teams mean a greater festival of football or dilution of a world-leading product?

This was actually the joint-biggest win in international competition in Bayern's history, matching the 10-0 victory over Anorthosis Famagusta in the 1983 UEFA Cup.

We know that these are the final days of Thomas Muller's 25-year affiliation with Bayern Munich.

So for him to add two more goals to his tally this afternoon felt pretty important for the 35-year-old. And his second strike brought up an impressive milestone as he moved onto 250 goals for the German giants.

It was the first time he has scored twice in the same game for Bayern since all the way back in August.

If you'd told me Bayern Munich were going to rack up 10 goals today, then I would have expected Harry Kane to have got his name on the scoresheet three or four times.

So for him to completely miss out on the goals — and assists — is a real shock and perhaps an indication of the toll a long season has taken on him.

Vincent Kompany will hope that his goal drought will not extend too much further into the tournament as he will need to be heavily involved if Bayern are to go all the way over the next few weeks.

In line with Adam Crafton's point earlier on, there has been a lot of criticism in Spain, mostly from Barcelona fans, about the fact that Barca or Liverpool are not in the tournament.

However, these were the rules and the risk of such peculiarities recurring will continue to accompany the tournament. It's called the Club World Cup because there is representation from all over the world, including Oceania.

I am going to go out on a limb and say the next game at this Club World Cup won't be as one sided as the one we have just watched.

It is the first truly heavyweight clash of the tournament and it kicks off in just under an hour from the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.

Luis Enrique's newly crowned UEFA Champions League winners are facing Diego Simeone's Atletico Madrid and we are already covering that match live.

Auckland City were under no illusion about what would happen here. Bayern are Bayern. Their attitude was very much to come to the US, do their best, and raise some money for the local causes they support along the way. Among them, there's a new all-weather surface being built in their district which, when completed, will serve the local schools.

Is that worth a 10-0 defeat? Ask the players, but that was the higher purpose that the club carried into this tournament.

FT Bayern Munich 10-0 Auckland City

The Auckland City suffering is over. They can finally haul their tired bodies off the turf at TQL Stadium.

Credit to Bayern Munich for a very professional job and they, unsurprisingly, hold the record for the biggest win in Club World Cup history.

Hopefully the Auckland City players have enjoyed themselves out there, though I'm not sure they will have done.

90+1' Bayern Munich 10-0 Auckland City

I've got no idea why there will be five more minutes of this game, but there will be as advertised by the fourth official.

Muller, clearly not feeling sorry for his opponents, celebrated his side's 10th goal with a huge roar in the direction of the Bayern supporters inside TQL Stadium.

I reckon there are still plenty of them who want to see an 11th goal in this period of stoppage time...

89' Bayern Munich 10-0 Auckland City

Yes, they can! Muller has his second goal and Bayern have double figures.

88' Bayern Munich 9-0 Auckland City

No one was expecting much at all from Auckland City, but this has felt pretty cruel.

These two teams should not be playing against each other, particularly not in a tournament billed as the world's best teams going up against each other.

Can Bayern make it 10-0 in the last throes?

85' Bayern Munich 9-0 Auckland City

I have praised Conor Tracey a few times in this live occasion after a string of decent saves, but that is unforgiveable.

The Auckland City goalkeeper literally passed the ball straight to Musiala a yard or two outside his penalty area. The young midfielder stepped into the box and finished superbly into the bottom corner.

Musiala has the first hat-trick of the 2025 Club World Cup and will go home with the match ball!

84' Bayern Munich 9-0 Auckland City

And Bayern move closer to the double-figure victory as substitute Musiala completes his hat-trick!

80' Bayern Munich 8-0 Auckland City

Finally, Auckland City have had a shot at this Club World Cup!

Another promising counter-attack, this time with substitute Angus Kilkolly racing down the left wing. With no one in support, and with Bayern defenders converging on him from everywhere, he went for the spectacular.

It was never going in, but it did force Neuer into a diving save.

77' Bayern Munich 8-0 Auckland City

As a Leicester City fan, I take great pleasure in saying that I have seen a 9-0 win, when my beloved team stuffed Southampton on the road back in 2019.

And Manchester United inflicted the same margin of defeat on the same opponent a few years later.

I have still yet to see a team score 10 goals in one game — Bayern have another quarter of an hour or so to make that happen.

73' Bayern Munich 8-0 Auckland City

An eighth goal for Bayern Munich and their first from the penalty spot today.

It was actually a pretty harsh decision to award the spot kick with Musiala making a lot of a pretty innocuous challenge on him in the box.

The young Bayern midfielder dusted himself down and sent Tracey the wrong way from 12 yards.

71' Bayern Munich 7-0 Auckland City

That was the moment for Auckland City to get on the scoresheet.

It was, once again, Manickum who led the counter-attack and his pass was much better this time around. He picked out Yoo in plenty of space on the right-hand side of the penalty area, but the 25-year-old deliberated far too much and Musiala got back well to steal the ball away.

69' Bayern Munich 7-0 Auckland City

Plenty of good saves from Tracey today, but that is one that he will be disappointed with.

Musiala cut onto his right foot inside the D on the edge of the penalty area and bent a curling effort towards the corner. But it was at a nice height for Tracey and he should've kept it out.

But all he could was help it on its way past him.

England lacked inspiration despite fielding stars like Nwaneri and Elliott, but Tino Livramento and James Beadle were among those who impressed.

England Under-21s were held to a draw in their second European Championship fixture as Slovenia deservedly earned a point on a baking evening in Nitra, Slovakia.

Lee Carsley's side started in sloppy fashion as Slovenia went close on a few occasions, with one effort deflecting wide before Svit Seslar's overhead kick landed on the roof of the net. James McAtee had the Young Lions' first real sight of goal but could only drag his effort comfortably wide before Nwanneri failed to connect with Jonathan Rowe's fizzing low cross from point-blank range.

Positive signs began to emerge towards half-time as Harvey Elliott hit the woodwork and the start to the second half offered more encouragement as McAtee forced Martin Turk into a smart save before instinctively firing the rebound wide.

Carsley showed no fear in introducing fresh faces from the bench but no breakthrough arrived, leaving England on four points in Group B ahead of their next game against Germany on Wednesday..

After a grueling club soccer season, it was tough to know how some of the biggest European teams would approach the Club World Cup but Bayern Munich delivered an answer in their first group stage game, dismantling amateur Auckland City FC 10-0. It's a record win for a team taking part in the Club World Cup as Bayern surpassed Al-Hilal's 6-1 victory over Al Jazira in 2021. No team has ever scored more goals than Bayern's nine in a Club World Cup match either. 

With the tournament being expanded to 32 teams for this edition in the United States, this is a record that may not stand for long, but that won't matter for Bayern Munich after kicking off the tournament in style. 

By the end of the first half of play, the German giants were already ahead 6-0 with Kingsley Coman and Michael Olise netting braces. They didn't even need involvement from Harry Kane to reach that mark, with the attack going through the amateur side with ease. After only winning the Bundesliga this past season, Vincent Kompany is one of the managers whose side could use a Club World Cup to establish themselves as contenders for the Champions League next season. 

Kompany has been able to get time for new recruit Jonathan Tah to work his way into the defense after joining from Bayer Leverkusen. Tah will be a large part of any Bayern Munich success next season, so having a tournament like the Club World Cup for him to get into the team is quite important. Jamal Musiala was also able to net a hat trick in the second half of play in his return from a hamstring injury that kept him out at the end of the season. Coming off the bench to replace Kane, Musiala scored quite a goal from outside the box alongside a penalty and punished Auckland for a giveaway to complete his hat trick.

No matter what the score was, Bayern didn't let up on the pressure as every player was hungry for a goal. With Benfica and Boca Juniors as the other teams in the group, it's important to get off to a statement victory, and the German giants did just that. Auckland City FC still had an unforgettable moment despite the score, but with this being a tournament where they also want to pick up points, it's important to have a short memory and put this behind them because there are still important fixtures to play following this match.

The 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup starts this weekend, and the United States Men's National Team's path to an eighth Gold Cup title kicks off Sunday, June 15 in San Jose, California against Trinidad and Tobago. The USMNT will continue their group stage with back-to-back matches in Texas against Saudi Arabia on Thursday, June 19 and Haiti on Sunday, June 22.

Head coach Mauricio Pochettino released his 26-player roster last week, and it includes a mix of familiar faces and young talent. Miles Robinson, the hero for the United States in the 2021 Gold Cup final victory over Mexico, appears alongside other stalwart defenders such as Walker Zimmerman, Tim Ream and goalkeeper Matt Turner. Their experience will lead a group that is the third youngest to start the Gold Cup for the United States.

The USMNT looks to continue its command in the biennial tournament that has crowned the U.S. continental champions seven out of 17 times. Historically, the United States has dominated the group stage, totaling a 40-1-5 record and winning their group in 16 out of 17 Gold Cups, including the most recent competition in 2023.

Here's a look at the upcoming group stage schedule for the United States and the opponents:

FIFA World Ranking: No. 100

The United States has dominated the series against Trinidad and Tobago, winning 17 of 18 meetings on American soil. The most recent matchup between the two sides came November 2023 in the Concacaf Nations League tournament. At Port of Spain, the capital city of Trinidad and Tobago, the Americans played more than 50 minutes down to 10 men, and Trinidad and Tobago took advantage to record a 2-1 win. Playing in the States – which the Gold Cup primarily does — gives the USMNT a huge advantage, winning 17 of 18 matches against Trinidad and Tobago and outscoring the Caribbean nation 41-0 over the last 12.

With a win Sunday, the United States could equal its longest home winning streak against any opponent, tying with Ecuador, which the U.S. has beaten 16 consecutive times.

Kickoff: Sunday, June 15, 2025 – 6:00 p.m. ET at PayPal Park (San Jose, Calif.)

FIFA World Ranking: No. 58

The United States has only faced Saudi Arabia once in the past five years, a scoreless draw in an international friendly in September 2022. Before then, Saudi Arabia appeared in the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar where it most notably shocked the soccer world and defeated Argentina early in the group stage, handing the eventual and current reigning World Cup champions their only loss of the tournament.

Saudi Arabia enters the Gold Cup still alive in qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, earning a result in three of their last four AFC qualifying matches. This is the highest-ranked opponent the United States will face in the group stage.

Kickoff: Thursday, June 19, 2025 – 9:15 p.m. ET at Q2 Stadium (Austin, Texas)

FIFA World Ranking: No. 83

The United States has a longstanding history playing against Haiti, and the series dates all the way back to 1941 when the USSF was known as the U.S. Football Association. While Haiti owned the first half of the all-time series, the United States has been the far better team over the past several decades and has not lost to Haiti since 1973. The two nations have met four times in Gold Cup action, and the USA has never lost, earning three wins and one draw.

Kickoff: Sunday, June 22, 2025 – 7:00 p.m. ET at AT&T Stadium (Arlington, Texas)

The Gold Cup quarterfinals will be held June 28-June 29 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz. and U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis. The semifinals take place July 2 at Energizer Park in St. Louis and Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. 

Sixteen teams will look to make it to Houston, Texas where the final will be played at NRG Stadium on July 6. Among those in contention are defending champions Mexico in Group A. The United States and Mexico have dominated the tournament, and the two countries have combined to win 16 out of 17 times. Mexico won the last time around in 2023, beating a Panama side that outlasted the United States in penalty kicks in the semis. The Americans won the Gold Cup prior in 2021, swiping the trophy from Mexico thanks to Robinson's epic game-winning header in extra time.

The debate that roiled soccer fans for generations was also its most unanswerable: Which clubs, on which continents, played the best soccer? 

Unlike national teams that played one another in the quadrennial World Cup, there was rarely overlap between the top teams in Europe and South America, or North America, except for summertime “friendly” competitions. 

The FIFA Club World Cup, which begins this weekend across the U.S. and runs through the final on July 13, expanded its previously smaller format in an attempt to provide an answer. It now features 32 teams, from six continents, playing for a total prize money pool of $1 billion. 

“This is for bragging rights,” said Jill Ellis, the chief football officer of FIFA, soccer's global governing body, and a former World Cup-winning coach of the U.S. women's national team. “Prize money is a part of it. But most importantly, this is a chance to be the first-ever club world champion.”

As the tournament opens, however, the money is more than just a small part of it. Falling ticket prices, and accusations from Major League Soccer players that the league had agreed to participate in a “cash grab” that unfairly compensates them, have raised the question of just how much buy-in the new tournament has from U.S. audiences and players.

When tickets for Saturday's opening game in Florida between Inter Miami, featuring Lionel Messi, and Egyptian side Al Ahly went on sale in December through Ticketmaster, an upper-deck ticket cost $379 at the time. This week, similar ticket were on sale for as low as $116. According to NPR, FIFA has worked with a local Florida college to offer four complimentary tickets for students who pay for a single $20 ticket. Attendance for the opening game was announceed at 60,927, slightly shy of the stadium's capacity of 65,000.

Bayern Munich, the perennial German champion, listed lower-bowl tickets for its opener Sunday in Cincinnati for as low as $107 when its tickets went on sale in December; on Saturday, tickets were being resold on Stubhub for half that.

For as little as $8, fans can watch a June 25 game between the Japanese Urawa Red Diamonds and Mexican side C.F. Monterrey. 

"We anticipace great attendances and electric atmospheres at its inaugural edition, with excitement growing with every round of matches and the tournament ultimately standing as the undisputed pinnacle of club world football," FIFA said, in part of a statement sent to NBC News. "The appetite speaks for itself: fans from over 130 countries have already purchased tickets. The top 10 markets are led by the United States, followed by Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Canada, France, Japan, Switzerland, Germany and Portugal — a clear sign of global anticipation and reach." 

As a new tournament, the Club World Cup cannot offer much in the way of prestige or history. Instead, it has offered a historic amount of prize money, with $525 million of the total $1 billion distributed to teams on a sliding scale, guaranteed, just for making the 32-team field. At the top, brand-name European teams such as Real Madrid, Manchester City, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain will earn between $12.8 and $38 million; at the bottom, New Zealand's Auckland City FC will earn $3.5 million. 

The remaining $475 million of the billion-dollar pool will then be determined by teams' performances; making the round of 16 earns each club $7.5 million, with quarterfinalists $13.1 million, and increasing up to the final. The winner can ultimately rake in up to $125 million, all of which adds up to much more than bragging rights — which has left Major League Soccer players asking why their cut from the windfall isn't greater. 

Before a June 1 match players from the Seattle Sounders donned white T-shirts during warmups that read “Club World Ca$h Grab,” with an image of the Mr. Monopoly character wearing an “MLS” top hat and holding a pouch reading “FIFA.” The protest led the team's owner to berate players afterward, according to the Seattle Times. 

The three teams in the Club World Cup field from Major League Soccer — Seattle, Inter Miami and Los Angeles Football Club — are each guaranteed $9.55 million for participating, before any bonuses are earned for performance. Players' earnings from participation or performance in a “compulsory tournament or noncompulsory tournament” is capped at $1 million, per the terms of the league's collective bargaining agreement.

The players' union has continued to push publicly to increase' players stake from what is currently about a 90/10 split, and has noted that before a major tournament in 2024, the players and MLS renegotiated the prize money distribution before ultimately landing at a 50-50 split.

In a statement to NBC News on Thursday, MLS said that it has “agreed to voluntarily provide additional performance-based compensation to players from the three participating clubs.” That proposal, the league said, would allocate 20% of all prize money earned from the group stage onward to players. 

“If an MLS club wins the Club World Cup, its players would collectively receive more than $24 million in performance bonuses,” the statement read. “MLS club owners believe performance-based incentives are appropriate given the expanded format and increased prize pool for the Club World Cup. The League values the continued dedication and commitment of its players and looks forward to supporting them as they represent their clubs — and Major League Soccer — on the global stage this summer.”

On June 8, the players association posted on X that it was “deeply disappointed” by the league's proposal.

“The timing, substance and retaliatory nature of the proposal sends a clear message: MLS does not respect or value players' efforts with regard to this tournament,” the post read. “Although not surprised, the players and the MLSPA are deeply disappointed by this message."

“I don't think sitting out is an option,” Seattle midfielder Albert Rusnak told reporters Friday. “Just because again, that inside what we have as athletes and winners and want to go out there and win and prove the people wrong whether we're talking about the bonuses or the people not believing we can do anything.”

Ellis, who works for FIFA, believes the prospect of playing on that global stage will lead to strong competition from players.

“I think the U.S. players, if you were to say to anyone, ‘Do you want to play in this tournament?' Sure, do they want to be paid as much as probably — I mean, that's within their own league and within the MLS to determine that, because obviously, unlike a lot of leagues around the world, MLS has a salary cap,” Ellis said. “So there's certain different structures and CBA, and so that's internal to that. 

“But I think in terms of what I and my experience in working with some of the best players in the world, elite players want to play against elite players. They want to test themselves, prove themselves, and they want to compete. ... Listen, at the end of the day it's a choice, but I think players will want to play in this event. 

“... In American sports when we win, when the Major League Baseball team wins, they're world champions. When the NFL team (wins) — the title is world champions. Well, yes, but they're playing against American teams. This is truly a world championship. This is the best clubs in the world.”

The U.S. men's national team is short-handed and under intense scrutiny as it kicks off its 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup campaign with a game against Trinidad and Tobago.

The USMNT's biggest star, Christian Pulisic, will controversially be rested for the tournament, while other big names like Weston McKennie are instead obliged to play at the overlapping FIFA Club World Cup. Making matters worse, a 4-0 embarrassment at the hands of Switzerland on Tuesday served as a reminder that entry-level basics in terms of intensity and effort have been in question for some time now.

Manager Mauricio Pochettino — who came in at significant expense after the U.S. badly underwhelmed at the 2024 Copa América — has run into the same sorts of issues that sunk his predecessor, Gregg Berhalter. On a four-game losing streak for the first time since 2007, the USMNT is under pressure to produce a comfortable win over the Soca Warriors.

Here is what to know for Sunday's Gold Cup game between the USMNT and Trinidad and Tobago:

The Concacaf Gold Cup group stage game pairing the USMNT with Trinidad and Tobago is set for 6 p.m. ET, with PayPal Park in San Jose, Calif. hosting.

Some lovely intricate play from Bayern as Raphael Guerreiro gets to the byline and cuts it back but there is Mario Ilich to clear.

Bayern are very much playing with their foot off the gas here but we know what can happen if they decide to turn it on for a moment as Thomas Muller leathers one towards goal but it's always rising.

This is not really that entertaining, even with all the goals. I'm away to read my book in the garden with a cool beer.

    Group B gets underway with an all-European clash.
  

Recently crowned Champions League winner Paris Saint-Germain returns to action on Sunday as it takes on Spain's Atlético Madrid in this first Group B match of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup. 

Below, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to use to watch every match of the tournament as it happens, wherever you are in the world, and how to use a VPN if the match isn't available where you are, along with a full fixture list. 

French Ligue 1 champion PSG comes into this game at the Rose Bowl with major doubts surrounding the involvement of Ousmane Dembélé, after the star forward picked up a knock playing for France in its UEFA Nations League semifinal clash with Spain. 

Atlético, meanwhile, will be looking to put aside a hugely disappointing collapse at the end of the season. In a matter of weeks, Diego Simeone's men went from being genuine treble contenders to ending the campaign empty-handed. 

PSG take on Atlético Madrid on Sunday, June 15, at the Rose Bowl Stadium in Pasadena, California. Kickoff is set for 3 p.m. ET or 12 p.m. PT. That makes it a 8 p.m. BST start in the UK and a 5 a.m. AEST kickoff in Australia on Monday. 

PSG boss Luis Enrique will be hoping his team can add to last month's triumph in the Champions League final. 

The great news for footy fans is that sports streaming platform DAZN is set to broadcast all 63 matches of the FIFA Club World Cup free in almost every country, with coverage available in multiple languages.

Existing DAZN subscribers or Freemium members can watch every game of the tournament as part of their current membership.

If you're not a member, it's easy to sign up for a free DAZN Freemium account using your email address to watch all the action at no cost through the DAZN app.

As well as dedicated apps for iOS and Android, DAZN offers a wide range of support for set-top boxes and smart TVs.

If you're traveling abroad and want to keep up with all the FIFA Club World Cup soccer action while away from home, a VPN can help enhance your privacy and security when streaming. 

Virtual private networks encrypt your traffic and prevent your internet service provider from throttling your speeds, and can also be helpful when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks while traveling, adding an extra layer of protection for your devices and logins. VPNs are legal in many countries, including the US and Canada, and can be used for legitimate purposes such as improving online privacy and security. 

However, some streaming services may have policies restricting VPN use to access region-specific content. If you're considering a VPN for streaming, check the platform's terms of service to ensure compliance. 

If you choose to use a VPN, follow the provider's installation instructions, ensuring you're connected securely and in compliance with applicable laws and service agreements. Some streaming platforms may block access when a VPN is detected, so verifying if your streaming subscription allows VPN use is crucial.

ExpressVPN is our current best VPN pick for people who want a reliable and safe VPN and it works on a variety of devices. It's normally $13 a month but if you sign up for an annual subscription for $100 you'll get three months free and save 49%. That's the equivalent of $6.67 a month.

Note that ExpressVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee.

Australia has a second option for watching the tournament live. Alongside DAZN's free coverage, pay TV broadcaster Foxtel and its sister streaming service Kayo will also be showing all 63 games. 

A Kayo Sports subscription starts at AU$25 a month and lets you stream on one screen, while its Premium tier costs AU$40 a month for simultaneous viewing on up to three devices.

The service gives you access to a wide range of sports, including F1, NRL, NFL, NHL and MLB, and there are no lock-in contracts. 

Better still, if you're a new customer, you can take advantage of a one-week Kayo Sports free trial.

Kendry Paez has flown to the United States to train with Chelsea despite not being named in their Club World Cup squad, in a bid to impress Enzo Maresca. 

The expectation remains that Paez, the 18-year-old Ecuadorian described as a wonderkid, will leave on loan this summer. 

He was signed on a pre-agreement at the age of 16 for £17million, and Chelsea's sister club Strasbourg is his likeliest destination. 

While it is understood Paez's preference would be to be around Chelsea's first team over the next season, the club are considering what is best for his progress.

Andrey Santos has been used as an example over how a temporary stay at Strasbourg can benefit beneficial, with the 21-year-old Brazilian among those in their Club World Cup squad in the United States. 

Chelsea flew to Philadelphia on Friday to begin their prep for FIFA's expanded club competition. 

Their first game will be against Los Angeles FC in Atlanta on Monday when Liam Delap is expected to make his debut after signing from Ipswich for £30million.

FIFA's rebranded Club World Cup got underway in the United States on Saturday, but with fans expressing bafflement at the name of a new award.

Veteran goalkeeper Oscar Ustari was rewarded for his display in the 0-0 draw between Inter Miami and Egyptian side Al Ahly in the opening game.

The Inter Miami goalkeeper saved a penalty to keep Lionel Messi's side in the match.

Eagle-eyed viewers highlighted that Ustari was presented with the 'Superior Player of the Match' award, rather than the traditional man of the match prize.

The name raised plenty of eyebrows among fans who took to social media in disbelief, not just at the awkward phrasing, but what they saw as another example of football losing the plot.

'What on earth is a "superior player of the match?"' one fan posted. Another simply wrote: 'Games gone, mate.'

A third X user fumed: 'Superior player of the match? You absolute sausages. Man of the match. End of!'

And a fourth branded it: 'Utter woke nonsense!'

Despite the outcry, the term is not actually the result of any recent shift in gendered language.

FIFA quietly phased out 'Man of the Match' from its international tournaments years ago. The 2022 World Cup in Qatar used the more neutral 'Player of the Match', following a similar move across many domestic leagues and competitions.

The 'Superior Player' element came as a result of one of the Club World Cup's sponsors, Michelob ULTRA.

The American beer brand carries the tagline 'Superior Light Beer'.

The branding was also used at the CONCACAF Champions Cup and Copa America — both held in the US — as part of the company's marketing drive.

Even so, some fans aren't having it. 'What the heck is "superior player'.. good Lord… FIFA is ruining football,' grumbled one such fan on X.

Another crudely joked: 'Is this for dumb Americans to understand? Blimey.'

Although many fans took issue with the name of the award, few could argue against Miami keeper Ustari being a worthy recipient.

The 38-year-old made a total of eight saves, including one from Trezeguet's first-half penalty, to earn a valuable clean sheet.

Miami's next game is now against Porto on Tuesday, before they face Palmeiras four days later.

...

Christian Pulisic made a debatable but reasonable decision last month to skip the Gold Cup, and that, he surely hoped, would be that. His body and mind were “talking” to him. They needed a full offseason to recharge ahead of next year's World Cup. He could play two friendlies for the U.S. men's national team in June, but a monthlong tournament? Nah. He told head coach Mauricio Pochettino and U.S. Soccer that he'd rather take some time off.

And that, we learned this week, was the only time that Pulisic and Pochettino, the team's star and renowned boss, have spoken over the past month.

In separate media appearances on Thursday and Saturday, they implicitly revealed discord that will now linger around the USMNT for a while.

The decision, meanwhile — inflamed by criticism, by Pulisic's dad and by former USMNT stars — has unraveled into a soap opera.

Pulisic, in response to the criticism, pointedly disclosed in a podcast interview with CBS Sports that he'd asked to play in this month's friendlies against Türkiye and Switzerland, but that coaches “said no." It was "common sense" to use the same roster for the friendlies and the Gold Cup," Pochettino said Saturday. Pulisic, 26, who has captained the USMNT dozens of times, added: “That's coach's decision, I fully respect that. I didn't understand it, but it is what it is.”

Pochettino, speaking Saturday ahead of the USMNT's Gold Cup opener, responded: “Players don't need to understand or not understand. Players need to listen and to stick with our plan. They cannot dictate the plan, because if [so], we invert, we swap positions, no? … We explain why we decide not to include [him] in the friendly games, and then if you have some problems — that is not my problem, [for him] to understand or not understand.”

With every comment Thursday and Saturday, the two stoked an already flammable situation. Pulisic admitted, when asked, that Pochettino's lack of communication, while not “an issue,” has been “slightly different” than his relationship with previous national team coaches. Pochettino indirectly responded that he couldn't keep in regular touch with 60 players, as if Pulisic were just another one of the 60. “I want to keep that all the players feel the same respect from the coaching staff and from myself,” he said.

Pochettino insisted that “communication is good with [Pulisic], like another [player].” But his insistence on treating Pulisic like any other player seems to be one source of a disconnect between the two. Pulisic is the most famous and successful men's soccer player that the U.S. has ever produced. He's undoubtedly the USMNT's most important, and previous coaches have managed him as such.

Pulisic once told a story about Pochettino's predecessor, Gregg Berhalter, calling him to the coach's office late at night after a friendly in which Pulisic had scored but also picked up an injury. Berhalter challenged Pulisic, and suggested that perhaps he needed to “train harder,” but not in a confrontational way; in a caring way. “You can tell he's passionate, and he cares about his players,” Pulisic said years later. That episode, during his first camp with Berhalter, made a lasting impression on him.

Interpersonal and special treatment, though, can privilege a star. In March, during the CONCACAF Nations League third-place match, when Pochettino chose to replace Pulisic with Tanner Tessmann, Pulisic appeared to wave off the sub so that he could take a free kick. Pochettino didn't seem pleased.

And a few months later, he doesn't sound pleased that Pulisic opted out of the Gold Cup — although he has publicly defended Pulisic's decision, and said he "understands" it, and called him “a very talented player” and “a very nice guy.”

“The people need to prioritize the national team,” Pochettino told USMNT legends Landon Donovan and Tim Howard on their podcast recently. “We were talking about Argentine players, or Brazilian players, or English players, or Spanish players, they are desperate. Even Messi, even Neymar, even Mbappé for France, these guys are desperate to go to the national team.” Pulisic, he said, "should be our Messi."

And on Saturday, he didn't sound pleased with Pulisic's Thursday interview. He reinforced that he — the $6 million coach who's worked at levels that none of his U.S. players ever have — is in control, and that no single player is bigger than him or the collective — or the player next to him.

“I [don't] prioritize,” Pochettino said. “You say [Pulisic is] the best player — yes, he's a good player, of course. But he needs to perform. Because I'm going to judge him like Diego [Luna], like another. If he performs well and he is the best, it's normal he's going to have a place in the national team.” But a player wouldn't just play because he says: “‘I want to play,' ‘I want to this,' ‘I want to that,'" Pochettino added.

“When I signed my contract [with] the federation, I am the head coach,” he said. “I am not a mannequin. That is how we are, and that is my culture about football.”

“It's we," Pochettino concluded. "We can win. We need to work together. We need to be all together. We we we we we we we. This sport is amazing because it's about we, not about I. It's about we.”

The USMNT will face Trinidad and Tobago in their first match of the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup. All eyes are on the United States Men's National Team after they suffered a 4-0 loss to Switzerland in a tune-up match earlier this week. That loss, combined with some controversial absences on the USMNT CONCACAF Gold Cup roster — most notably USMNT captain Christian Pulisic — puts even more pressure on the United States' opening CONCACAF match.

FIFA Club World Cup

Follow live coverage of Paris Saint-Germain vs Atletico Madrid and Bayern Munich vs Auckland City at the Club World Cup today

Last summer, as FIFA attempted to set the wheels in motion for the revamped 32-team Club World Cup in the United States, disagreement surfaced within the organization.

According to multiple sources familiar with the discussions, all of whom wished to remain anonymous to protect their working relationships, FIFA staff based in Miami wanted the tournament to lean more heavily on smaller MLS stadiums, particularly for games that may involve teams who are unfamiliar to the U.S. market. Their thesis was that hot-ticket events could boost revenues, while FIFA would also avoid empty seats in the first edition of a remodelled tournament.

Yet the message from senior officials in FIFA's European office, led by the organization's president Gianni Infantino, was clear. They wanted this tournament to be the biggest and the best. Infantino has described it as “a big bang” and the “most coveted” competition in world club football.

In the White House, standing next to the sitting President Donald Trump in the Oval Office, Infantino described the Club World Cup as the “best players from the best teams” and he said “millions of people will be coming”. He even ensured his own name was inscribed — in more than one place — on a trophy designed by Tiffany & Co; the brand was recommended by Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

Infantino told confidantes he wanted the prize money to be the biggest for any tournament in club football. He fell narrowly short — the winner of the Club World Cup, according to figures published by FIFA, may earn up to $125m (£93.5m), which is less than the $154m Real Madrid earned by winning the Champions League in 2024.

His ambition was reflected with the choice of stadiums, as eight of the 12 venues have capacities in excess of 65,000 and only 12 of the 64 games will be played in MLS-dedicated venues — in Nashville, Cincinnati, Orlando and Washington, D.C.

This leaves modest fixtures in huge stadiums; Brazilian team Fluminense against South African side Mamelodi Sundowns in Hard Rock Stadium (65,000 capacity); Fluminense and Korea's Ulsan HD at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey (82,500 capacity); and Brazilian side Flamengo against the Tunisian team Esperance de Tunis at Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field (69,000 capacity). As of last week, the Sundowns' match against Fluminense had sold less than 10,000 tickets, and even games involving Inter Milan and Paris Saint-Germain in Pasadena and Seattle are likely to fall way short of selling out.

At this point, we should remember tournaments do not always sell out, even in football markets often considered more mature. Amid the nostalgic folklore of the European Championship held in England in 1996, which is often framed as the summer when “football came home,” attendances were actually rather modest.

Spain's opening match against Bulgaria attracted 26,000 at Leeds United's Elland Road. Five group-stage games had crowds of less than 20,000. There were tens of thousands of empty seats at Manchester United's Old Trafford for the semi-final between the Czech Republic and France. There were plenty of reasons for this; ticket prices were considered high, while the average British football fan may have been less curious about foreign teams in the 1990s than they are today, and an IRA bomb early in the tournament in Manchester city centre also may have dissuaded people away from public spaces — although some of the early group games with low attendances preceded the attack. A quick search of “empty seats” on Google also reveals discussions on the topic during the World Cup in Qatar in 2022, Brazil in 2014 and Japan and South Korea in 2002, although this was more due to no-shows and ticketing issues than a lack of demand.

The sight of empty seats for the Club World Cup will lead to plenty of scorn, and probably plenty of memes. There are worries among some figures involved with host-city planning for next year's World Cup in the U.S. that empty seats at the Club World Cup will undermine the story they seek to tell of soccer being on the brink of exploding across the country. Some worry that it may impact their pitches to potential sponsors of fan festivals around the World Cup. In short, there is a danger the Club World Cup will be seen as the latest referendum on America's appetite for the sport, but such conclusions should come with caution, and there are plenty of reasons why American fans may be sceptical of spending big on these games.

Any post-mortem should focus more heavily on the supply (FIFA) rather than the demand (soccer fans in the U.S.). Many factors combined to create a tournament that has been struggling for positive publicity outside of the quotes largely published as press releases by either competing clubs or FIFA.

Firstly, FIFA set expectations and prices for the competition at a level that were wildly out of kilter for the product. FIFA's tournament slogan of “the best against the best” is immediately undermined by the fact the current champions of England, Spain and Italy are not involved, owing to the qualification format FIFA laid out.

FIFA's chances of maximizing success were also hindered by arriving late into the planning and organization of the tournament. This is not something the U.S. bid for — they were simply told Infantino was bringing the competition to their country. This is why FIFA was left with so little leverage when securing venues for the tournament, paying high rental fees that nearly guarantee stadiums will receive healthy profits regardless of ticket sales. FIFA says venues were offered incentives via commissions on further ticket sales if they connected the stadium's “legacy fans” with tickets.

Yet FIFA did not have venues secured until last autumn, while sponsors also arrived late in the day — at lower rates than the governing body first imagined when conceptualizing the tournament. A broadcaster, DAZN, was announced as a $1billion partner in December. This was before the streaming platform received around the same amount in funding from Saudi Arabia, but this fell billions short of Infantino's original hopes for the competition's TV deal. In the weeks before striking the DAZN deal, which also secured the participation and prize money for competing teams, several European clubs were privately considering walking away from the competition.

As for the appetite of the U.S. public, FIFA presumed it was onto a winner in a country where tickets for major sports events sell and resell into many hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars. The problem this time, however, is few people across the world appeared to fully understand the event, which has also been the subject of criticism and lawsuits from bodies such as the Premier League, La Liga and world players' union FIFPro, who have expressed concerns about a cluttered football calendar or players being overworked.

FIFA set expensive ticket prices for teams who are, to put it mildly, new to the U.S. market. Some games are scheduled for weekday afternoons, which can be inconvenient both for those who work but also due to the summer heat. There are exceptions, notably games involving Argentina's Boca Juniors in Miami, or Real Madrid anywhere at all, while a match between PSG and Atletico Madrid in the group stage at the Rose Bowl is selling better since the French team won the Champions League, but will still fall short of a sell-out. Infantino's claims about millions of visitors also appear highly unlikely, while some domestic fans have been concerned by reports of government immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) agents being present at games amid the Trump administration's rhetoric on immigration. ICE told NBC that “all non-American citizens need to carry proof of their legal status.”

The Athletic has reported how, as of two weeks before the tournament, tens of thousands of seats remained unsold at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens to host Lionel Messi's Inter Miami against Egyptian team Al-Ahly. FIFA has offered students of Miami Dade College (which has over 100,000 enrolled) the opportunity to buy tickets for $20, with up to four complimentary tickets. This means some fans will be watching Messi for as little as $4, which is a far cry from the cheapest seats being cast at $349 when the draw was made in December. Elsewhere, FIFA has been quietly sending partial refunds to some supporters who bought tickets at higher prices through their club team allocations when they first became available, while other games are also braced for either low attendances or late giveaways to avoid vast sections of empty seats.

To fill the stadiums, the dynamically priced market may work in favor of consumers, driving prices down where supply is low. There has been a substantial increase in ticket sales over the past fortnight, and there is also hope that once the tournament starts — and established European teams with large followings advance to the final rounds — both interest and demand will follow. By the end, this first edition may even start to look like a roaring success after a false start.

Speaking this week, Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey said his “guess” was that MetLife Stadium would have between 40,000 and 50,000 for their first game this weekend between Portuguese side Porto and Brazilian team Palmeiras. While this would leave at least 30,000 empty seats, it would also, in most settings, be a pretty impressive attendance for a game between two teams who are not hugely familiar to an American audience in an unproven tournament. It is hard to imagine, for example, the attendance being any higher if the same game were played in England.

In FIFA HQ, there have been strategic mistakes. FIFA presumed a home market would turn out for Inter Miami, but locals did not want to stump up significantly more than they usually do to watch Messi regularly in MLS. It would have been smarter to take Messi on tour, hitting different markets where he appears less regularly. The late inclusion of MLS side LAFC — owing to the expulsion of Mexican team Leon — meant games involving LAFC could not be played in Los Angeles, where the team is well-supported in their local market, as the calendar was already set.

FIFA is also operating in a market that is saturated. Other soccer is available this summer in the U.S., notably the Gold Cup, which will include the U.S. men's national team and a full-strength Mexico. FIFA also managed to irritate Concacaf, which hoped to have the southern portion of the west coast largely to themselves for the Gold Cup, only for FIFA to then strike a deal to play games at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. The Premier League will also bring Manchester United to New Jersey, Atlanta and Chicago this summer as part of its Summer Series, while many fans may be saving up for FIFA's own World Cup next summer, particularly since The Athletic recently revealed the tournament will also be dynamically priced.

Some humility, therefore, may have been in order this summer for FIFA, which had an opportunity to develop goodwill and excitement ahead of the World Cup. FIFA, which projects $13bn of revenue during the cycle leading through next year's tournament, might have used this as a chance to recognize the sport is still emerging and offer a wider selection of truly affordable tickets from the outset. Those same supporters who benefited this summer may then have been inspired to either save up for next summer or spend money around fan festivals at the World Cup. Instead, the tickets only became affordable when the organization's president was at risk of being embarrassed by attendances.

FIFA's attempts to capture the imagination of the U.S. market have been increasingly frantic. Infantino has been touring the U.S., but some clubs wonder whether the divisive FIFA president is the best salesman for the tournament.

As part of his recent attempts to charm a younger audience, he visited the influencer iShowSpeed in late May, when he claimed Cristiano Ronaldo was talking to participating clubs about a transfer that would enable him to compete in the tournament. No move materialized, and Ronaldo's representatives were irritated by Infantino's comments.

A spokesperson representing the influencer told The Athletic no payment was offered or received in either direction for Infantino to appear on Speed's stream.

FIFA has engaged numerous American influencers to promote the tournament, an apparent attempt at connecting with the most casual of soccer fans. They have hired Shayne Boyle, who appears to be most famous for catching items in his mouth on an Instagram account called insaneshayne1 followed by 2.9 million people, as well as food content creator meals_by_cug, the innovation creator unnecessaryinventions and the baseball video creator Kait Maniscalco (askkait).

The coming weeks will tell us whether FIFA's strategy has paid dividends.

    The German giant takes on Oceania's only representative in the tournament.
  

The FIFA Club World Cup action shifts to Cincinnati on Sunday for a Group C clash that appears to be something of a mismatch, as German Bundesliga behemoth Bayern Munich takes on tournament underdog Auckland City. 

Below, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to use to watch every match of the tournament as it happens, wherever you are in the world, and how to use a VPN if the match isn't available where you are, along with a full fixture list. 

Six-time UEFA Champions League winner Bayern comes into this tournament fresh from having clinched the German championship last month. With star man Harry Kane only just back from last week's international duty with England, veteran striker Thomas Müller looks set to deputise up front for the Bavarians, while key defender Alphonso Davies is set to miss the tournament with a knee injury.

Auckland's group of mainly part-time players, meanwhile, will be looking to pull off a major shock. The current OFC Champions League holder is seen as the weakest side in the tournament, but it comes into this game sitting in third in its domestic New Zealand National League and in reasonably good form, with three wins from its last four fixtures.

Bayern Munich take on Auckland City on Sunday, June 15, at TQL Stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio. Kickoff is set for 12 p.m. ET or 9 a.m. PT. That makes it a 5 p.m. BST start in the UK and a 2 a.m. AEST kickoff in Australia on Monday. 

Thomas Muller is set to lead the line for Bayern Munich today in what is set to be the 35-year-old's final tournament.

The great news for footy fans is that sports streaming platform DAZN is set to broadcast all 63 matches of the FIFA Club World Cup free in almost every country, with coverage available in multiple languages.

Existing DAZN subscribers or Freemium members can watch every game of the tournament as part of their current membership.

If you're not a member, it's easy to sign up for a free DAZN Freemium account using your email address to watch all the action at no cost through the DAZN app.

As well as dedicated apps for iOS and Android, DAZN offers a wide range of support for set-top boxes and smart TVs.

If you're traveling abroad and want to keep up with all the FIFA Club World Cup soccer action while away from home, a VPN can help enhance your privacy and security when streaming. 

It encrypts your traffic and prevents your internet service provider from throttling your speeds and can also be helpful when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks while traveling, adding an extra layer of protection for your devices and logins. VPNs are legal in many countries, including the US and Canada, and can be used for legitimate purposes such as improving online privacy and security. 

However, some streaming services may have policies restricting VPN use to access region-specific content. If you're considering a VPN for streaming, check the platform's terms of service to ensure compliance. 

If you choose to use a VPN, follow the provider's installation instructions, ensuring you're connected securely and in compliance with applicable laws and service agreements. Some streaming platforms may block access when a VPN is detected, so verifying if your streaming subscription allows VPN use is crucial.

ExpressVPN is our current best VPN pick for people who want a reliable and safe VPN and it works on a variety of devices. It's normally $13 a month but if you sign up for an annual subscription for $100 you'll get three months free and save 49%. That's the equivalent of $6.67 a month.

Note that ExpressVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee.

As well as DAZN, footy fans in the UK have a second option for watching FIFA Club World Cup matches that is also free.

Free-to-air broadcaster Channel 5 will show 23 select features live during the tournament, including today's tournament opener. 

That also means this match can be livestreamed via the network's My5 online service. Coverage begins at 4 p.m. BST. 

Channel 5 is available through Freeview, Freesat, Freely, Sky or Virgin Media. 

If you want to stream the network's coverage from the tournament, you can head to Channel5.com or download the dedicated My5 app for iOS, Android and smart TVs.

Like the UK, Australia also has a second option for watching the tournament live. Alongside DAZN's free coverage, pay TV broadcaster Foxtel and its sister streaming service Kayo will also be showing all 63 games. 

A Kayo Sports subscription starts at AU$25 a month and lets you stream on one screen, while its Premium tier costs AU$40 a month for simultaneous viewing on up to three devices.

The service gives you access to a wide range of sports, including F1, NRL, NFL, NHL and MLB, and there are no lock-in contracts. 

Better still, if you're a new customer, you can take advantage of a one-week Kayo Sports free trial.

A largely incoherent Inter Miami was held to a scoreless draw by Al Ahly as the opening ceremony outshined the football on the pitch

Well, this was at least a first. Gianni was right on that front. On a clammy, boisterous, vaguely hallucinogenic night at the Hard Rock Stadium, the opening act of Fifa's billion-dollar death star, the newly bulked and tanned Club World Cup, did produce something new. This was surely the first major sporting event where the opening ceremony was infinitely more entertaining, and indeed comprehensible as a basic human activity, than the sporting spectacle that followed.

By the end, the best team in Africa, Al Ahly, had drawn 0-0 with a largely incoherent Inter Miami, who looked in the first half like they had a dim idea what this sport is meant to look like, but who were also struggling through a terrible wall-eyed hangover to remember which way is forward.

The second half was better, mainly because some element of the Lionel Messi identity began to assert itself, a muscle memory of genius, like watching the aged Frank Sinatra still tootling out That's Life on stage in Vegas, still drawing huge gales of applause for nodding a lot and pointing at the crowd.

This was the only significant emotion here: a deep sadness at seeing this spectacle play out, the post-Messi Messi, wheeled on to this stage of fakery, an instrument of sporting beauty weaponised in his dotage to promote a power grab.

And watching this you really got the scale of Fifa's act of deception, its betrayal of sport, the cynicism of its methods. Because everybody loves Messi, because there is a hard-wired emotional response, because you cannot resist. We will bolt the aged Messi to the front of our project, will play with your feelings, will in effect produce a targeted sporting crystal meth.

Actually that sounds a bit too exciting. The football here was largely abysmal. Does this matter? This thing isn't really built to be a robust sporting entity. It is simply product, an attempt to capture a global market. This is Fifa enabling the foreign policy aims of Saudi Arabia, sticking a flag in the middle of the world's greatest popular culture megaphone. It's the projection of a single random Swiss administrator.

Although, to be fair, lots of things that were supposed to be bad were actually fine here. The talk of half-empty stadiums always seemed a bit over the top. The Fifa marketing machine is a juggernaut. Americans are good at turning up to stuff. And mainly it was never going to be empty because Messi was here, Miami loves Messi, and America loves stars.

The Hard Rock is a castle-on-the-hill kind of structure, with its crisp, white, flying roof, dumped down in a vast expanse of shimmering tarmac. By the time the opening ceremonials came around the stands were pretty much full. The great Sir David appeared, looking graver now, hands folded like the fourth Earl of Sandwich, producing one of those expensive-looking regal waves, not really a wave at all, just a power-flex.

A DJ played club tunes, which was fun and infectious and gleefully received, not because of Fifa or football but because this is Miami and something about the air, the heat, the light, just makes this a place of fun and pleasure and show, and because Miami is full of beautiful glowing people who look like they're probably eternal.

The ceremony was good, not the stiff, mannered stuff these affairs often dish up, but loads of people dancing and playing horns and looking like they actually enjoy doing this. A terrifying horror movie-style voice shouted “take it to the worrrlllldd”, in a manner that suggested its owner was in the process of being expertly throttled.

Messi was last out on to the pitch. Everyone went predictably nuts, a shared static field of excitement, event glamour, the sense of being present at some kind of celebrity miracle.

He started in a non-position, just walking about vaguely, like a man having a stroll while listening to a podcast. Messi does, though, still have the shuffle the little switch, the groove, the music in his head. Watching him you got that feeling of a truly great footballer who can still see it all, but just can't call the shapes into being, Mozart with tinnitus, Hemingway staggering about the Florida Keys in his soggy late days, still feeling his own greatness, still the matador, even while he's sinking pisco sours in a crab shack

There was something frustrating and even slightly offensive about seeing Messi like this. It expresses perfectly the deeply manipulative nature of this event, of owners and political interests who will take that thing you love and use it to move the world around, who know you simply cannot resist. That thing that gives you pleasure and feels like freedom and joy? We will inject it into your eyes like a forced stimulant, a kind of footballing pornography.

Al Ahly should have scored at least twice in the opening 20 minutes. They missed a penalty. The YouTube overlord IShowSpeed appeared in the half-time break and prodded a ball toward the goal a few times, trailed by a man with a camera coiled into a furious crouch as though preserving the last recorded sighting of the snow leopard.

Messi woke up in the second half. Miami were better. They might have won, or at least scored. But a goalless draw felt right. The people in the stadium were the only winners here, in a city that just loves its nights.

Otherwise, Saturday in America was a day for a divisive, autocratic president to stage his own hugely overblown and narcissistic Grand Parade. It was in the end a pathetic spectacle and, in every sense of the word, the ghost of something great and pure and much-loved, out there being sold back to you like an empty replica shirt.

Check out the stats behind Inter Miami's 0-0 draw to open the FIFA Club World Cup. (0:33)

MIAMI, Florida -- Inter Miami CF and Al Ahly played out a 0-0 draw in front of a healthy crowd on the opening night of FIFA's Club World Cup on Saturday.

Egyptian side Al Ahly had the best opportunity to find a goal, but Trézéguet saw a first-half penalty saved by Miami goalkeeper Oscar Ustari, who had an outstanding opening 45 minutes.

Lionel Messi, starting the game just four days after appearing for Argentina in the World Cup qualifier against Colombia, was brighter after half-time and almost helped Miami snatch a winner.

He went close with a free kick, almost set up Fafà Picault with a late header which was tipped over and hit the bar with an effort in stoppage-time.

There were few fireworks on the pitch, but FIFA will count the turn out for the game at Miami Dolphins' Hard Rock stadium as a big win. Despite fears over a low attendance ahead of kick-off, more than 60,000 fans came to watch the opening game of the newly expanded tournament. -- Rob Dawson

When a squad headlined by Messi and Luis Suárez takes the field, few expect for anyone else to shine. However, goalkeeper Ustari managed to steal the show from his world-renowned teammates against Al Ahly in the Club World Cup opener.

In the first half alone, the goalkeeper made four crucial saves from open play to deny the Egyptians an early lead. Inter Miami's defensive struggles exposed Ustari to the speed of Al Ahly's forwards, forcing the goalkeeper into a number of perfectly timed saves. But it wasn't until the 46th minute that Ustari cemented his man-of-the-match status by saving the match-defining penalty. For the first time since Oct. 28, 2022, Ustari stopped a shot from the spot -- helping keep Inter Miami level.

Though the 38-year-old joined Inter Miami in September 2024, Ustari only recently became the starting goalkeeper after Drake Callender suffered a long-term injury in January. The two-time Argentina international worked himself up from the bench to the crucial figure that saved Inter Miami from embarrassment on the global stage.

Ustari finished the team's first match of the Club World Cup with eight saves, more than the amount of shots on goal (5) from Inter Miami. The goalkeeper deserves recognition for his performance, but his starring role against Al Ahly probably only exposes Inter Miami's weaknesses. Ustari may not be enough to save the team's struggling defense and injury-laden roster from Group A's other opponents, FC Porto and Palmeiras. -- Lizzy Becherano

Al Ahly were by far the better team in the first half, but just couldn't find a goal.

As early as the eighth minute, Inter Miami's defence was being cut open when Emam Ashour went clean through. Wessam Abou Ali thought he'd scored after 30 minutes but his effort was ruled out for offside. It was just before the break when Ustari capped off an impressive first-half performance by saving Trezeguet's penalty.

Despite Inter Miami's better second half, Al Ahly will feel like they've missed an opportunity.

With the 2024-25 season officially over, it's time to rank the top 100 players in the world of men's soccer right now. Welcome to the FC 100. Read the full list here.

Group A is one of the more modest and there's a realistic chance for any of the four teams to qualify. Al Ahly will now likely need to beat either Palmeiras or Porto to qualify and after drawing with Miami -- a task that won't be easy. They will have had hopes of doing well in the U.S. after finishing third in the smaller version of the tournament in Saudi Arabia 2023. After an opening draw in a game they probably should have won, it will be uphill from here. -- Dawson

FIFA will be happy that the Hard Rock Stadium was nearly full for the opening game of the Club World Cup. Huge gaps in the stands for the big kick-off would have been embarrassing for president Gianni Infantino. There were empty seats scattered throughout the tiers -- the attendance was announced as 60,927 with Hard Rock's capacity around 65,000 -- but the crowd was big enough for FIFA to count it as a success.

They were helped by thousands of supporters wearing Al Ahly colours. There were as many red shirts as pink Inter Miami ones and the Egyptian fans were far louder.

Despite FIFA's insistence that this is a serious competition, there was still a pre-season feel about some of it. The players were individually introduced before running onto the pitch ahead of the kick-off and at half-time a collection of football legends faced off against YouTuber IShowSpeed in a crossbar challenge. Former Italian great Alessandro Del Piero won.

Ref cam was a positive addition to the coverage. The camera attached to Australian A-League Men official Alireza Faghani gave a close up of his view when he awarded a first-half penalty to Al Ahly, subsequently missed by former Aston Villa forward Trezeguet. -- Dawson

After a poor start to June, the U.S. men's national team is kicking off its 2025 Gold Cup campaign against Trinidad and Tobago. 

Just a few months ago, the USMNT would have been one of the favorites to dethrone Mexico as Gold Cup champions. Except the Stars and Stripes' best players, including Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson, Folarin Balogun and Sergiño Dest, are missing out on this summer's tournament due to injury or personal reasons.

The Stars and Stripes in turn have suffered two defeats to Türkiye and Switzerland in the lead up to the Gold Cup. The pressure is on Mauricio Pochettino to get the USMNT back to winning ways against Trinidad and Tobago, but he might have to do so without Tyler Adams, who is still dealing with a foot injury.

Here's what the Stars and Stripes' XI could look like to kick off the Gold Cup.

GK: Matt Freese—The NYCFC shot-stopper is set to return to the starting lineup after Matt Turner conceded four goals against Switzerland.

RB: Alex Freeman—With Dest yet to make his return to the national team, Freeman gets the big opportunity to be Pochettino's starting man on the right flank.

CB: Chris Richards—Richards will hope to translate his stellar season for Crystal Palace to this summer's tournament for the United States. 

CB: Mark McKenzie—The center back will be eager to put in a better shift just four days after the Stars and Stripes' embarrassing defensive performance at GEODIS Park.

LB: Max Arfsten—Although he is at his best as a left wing-back, Arfsten will have to focus on his defensive responsibilities for the USMNT.

DM: Johnny Cardoso—Cardoso put together an impressive campaign for Real Betis this past season, but has struggled to perform under Pochettino. The pressure is on the midfielder to rediscover his form or risk losing his starting spot.

DM: Luca de la Torre—De la Torre returns to the starting lineup to partner Cardoso in the midfield.

RW: Jack McGlynn—The Houston Dynamo forward scored the USMNT's only goal in the last 180 minutes. He should have little trouble finding success against Trinidad and Tobago's leaky backline.

AM: Malik Tillman—The midfielder is coming off a career-best season with PSV in which he bagged 16 goals in the team's Eredivisie-winning campaign. Tillman has been one of the bright spots for an undermanned USMNT side in June.

LW: Diego Luna—The 21-year-old created the most chances in the USMNT's defeat to Türkiye and should once again get the nod on the left wing.

ST: Brian White—White is third in the MLS Golden Boot race with 10 goals in 12 appearances for the Vancouver Whitecaps. The striker will hope to impress in what could be just his fifth international cap.

SAN JOSE, Calif. — By now, you may have heard that Christian Pulisic isn't with the U.S. men's national team preparing for the Concacaf Gold Cup, which the Americans kick off on Sunday against Trinidad and Tobago (coverage begins at 6 p.m. ET on FOX).

But before and after the USMNT went through its final pre-tournament training session on Saturday, Pulisic's absence continued to be a hot topic. 

For the uninitiated, Pulisic asked not to participate in the Gold Cup because of fatigue following two grueling seasons with Italian club AC Milan. That decision was roundly criticized by a number of former U.S. legends, most notably Landon Donovan.

On Thursday, Pulisic finally explained his reasoning during an interview with CBS Sports, and revealed that he wanted to play in this month's two pre-Gold Cup exhibitions versus Türkiye and Switzerland. Pochettino, who wanted to use the same squad all summer, turned him down.

"That's the coach's decision," Pulisic said. "I fully respect that. I didn't understand it, but it is what it is."

During his pregame press conference on Saturday, I asked Pochettino about Pulisic's comments. The former Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham Hotspur manager didn't hold back.

"Players don't need to understand," Pochettino said. "Players need to listen and to stick with our plan. They cannot dictate the plan.

"He explained why he only wanted to be involved in two games and not the Gold Cup, and I respect that," added Pochettino. "I understand him. But I do need that he understands our decision.

"When I signed my contract with the [U.S. Soccer] Federation, I am the head coach. I am not a mannequin."

Pulisic also told CBS, whose parent company produces a documentary series on him, that he hasn't spoken with Pochettino much since the Argentine was hired last September on a contract through next summer's World Cup.

"We had one phone call where we discussed everything," Pulisic said. "He understood kind of where I was coming from, and that' as much conversation as I've had with him."

Pochettino said that he makes sure not to talk to any particular player more than any other, so it doesn't seem like he's playing favorites.

"I love to be in communication with my players," the 53-year-old said. "I love to communicate, but at the same time, I want to [ensure] that all the players feel the same respect from the coaching staff and from myself."

A few hours earlier, before the Americans trained in nearby Santa Clara ahead of Sunday's match at PayPal Park, home of the San Jose Earthquakes, U.S. veteran Chris Richards was asked about what has become a public feud between Pulisic and Donovan.

"At the end of the day, we're just focused on the people that are here," Richards said. "Of course, Christian's a big part of our group. But he's not here. So we just focus on the people who are here and who are ready to win. That's been kind of our big message."

It has to be. For a team that enters the regional championship having lost four consecutive games, beating the Soca Warriors has to be where all their energy and attention is directed. A win on Sunday would help put the spotlight back on the field.

"I think in the last few months, we've had a lot of people talking kind of down on the team, which is okay," Richards said. "We love our fans. We love our haters as well. So we kind of take that and it gives us motivation to, hopefully, change the narrative."

In 2023, Novak Djokovic had one of the best seasons of his career, winning three major titles and making the final of Wimbledon. 

The 24-time major champion was close to completing the calendar Grand Slam, and would've been the sixth player, man or woman, in history to complete the feat, had he not fallen at the final hurdle in SW19. 

Djokovic lost to Carlos Alcaraz in a five-set thriller on Centre Court, with the Spaniard clinching his first crown at the All England Club. 

Following the final, questions were raised about how much longer he would remain at the top of the game for, with the rise of Alcaraz marking a potential passing of the torch. 

It didn't take long for Djokovic to shut down those questions, however, as he went on to win his fourth US Open title later that season. 

After securing the trophy with a straight-sets win over Daniil Medvedev, he took a moment to answer his critics. 

When asked about public opinion of his potential decline in level after losing the Wimbledon final earlier that year, Djokovic said: “Well, I mean, people like to talk, obviously. So there are a lot of different opinions out there.

“I mean, it's not my interest and neither business to really review what everyone talks about or thinks, whether there is a passing of the torch or new gen, next gen, future gen, whatever you want to call it, happening or not happening in the sport.

“You know, I focus on what I need to do and how I get myself in an optimal state so that I can win the biggest trophies in our sport. That's what I care about.

“It's great for our sport that I have very good rivalries with Alcaraz, no doubt. He's such a refreshment for tennis, a great player, an amazing player, great guy as well.

“So I think, you know, collectively we all want more attention and interest going towards the tennis. The more people get involved with tennis in whatever shape or form, the better it is for all of us. 

“But, look, in the end of the day, my goal was always, at the beginning of the season, to try to win all Grand Slams.

“You know, I would definitely sign right away the paper if somebody would tell me I would win three out of four and play Wimbledon finals. 

“There is a little regret that I didn't win that Wimbledon final. But, look, in the end of the day, you know, I have so much more to be happier and content with than actually to regret something.

I'm going to keep going. You know, I feel good in my own body. I still feel I got the support of my environment, of my team, of my family.”

Djokovic continued in his press conference: “Grand Slams, I have vocalised that in the last few years, have always been the highest goal and the priority of mine in the whole season. 

“I don't play as much in terms of other tournaments, so I try to, you know, prioritise my preparation so that I can peak in slams.

“Yeah, these are the moments and these are the kind of emotions that I motivate myself with every single day when I'm not playing a tournament. 

“Yeah, occasionally asking myself, why do I need this still at this stage after all I have done, you know? How long do I want to keep going? I do have these questions in my head, of course.

“But knowing that I play at such a high level still and I win the biggest tournaments in this sport, yeah, I don't want to get rid of this sport or I don't want to leave this sport if I'm still at the top, you know, if I'm still playing the way I'm playing.”

The 38-year-old has since played in six majors and has made one final and three semi-finals, but is yet to capture Grand Slam number 25.

As if saving three match points to win the French Open were not outlandish enough, Carlos Alcaraz has once again achieved the impossible: a quiet holiday in Ibiza.

The 22-year-old's annual excursions to the most Bacchanalian of the Balearics were a big topic in Carlos Alcaraz: My Way, a documentary released in April. 

For two years in a row the Spaniard's team tried to dissuade him, twice he defied them and joined friends for three days to ‘reventar' - literally to burst, translated in Netflix's ghastly Hollywood dubbing as ‘get wasted'.

After beating Jannik Sinner in one of the great Grand Slam finals last Sunday, Alcaraz partied in Paris until the early hours of Monday, then flew to Ibiza via Madrid. 

But the emotional and physical toll of that five-and-a-half-hour epic was such that it was more R&R than R&B.

‘This year Ibiza was more chill,' said Alcaraz at Queen's Club, on the eve of the event he won in 2023. 

‘It was fun but honestly, I rested a lot, physically and mentally. But I had fun, a nice three days. It was more than enough.

‘Once I went to bed so late, that's the craziest thing. Obviously I danced a bit, I did some shots as well, but nothing more than that. More chill and as a normal person does.'

Did his coach Juan Carlos Ferrero and agent Albert Molina try to persuade him not to go this time? ‘

They didn't,' said Alcaraz with his toothy grin. ‘They knew at the beginning of Roland Garros I was going to go, 100 per cent.'

It has become a lethal formula: French Open, Ibiza, Queen's, win Wimbledon. If he makes it a hat trick of All England Club titles, as he is favourite to do, surely the routine will continue ad infinitum.

‘It's really, really intense, the clay season,' said Alcaraz. ‘After Roland Garros is the best moment to go anywhere. My friends go to Ibiza every year but it doesn't matter where you go - it's a time to turn off your mind.

‘After such an intense Roland Garros it was great to disconnect from everything, have fun and then come back with more energy.'

Alcaraz's trip to Ibiza last year left him undercooked for Queen's, and the man who took advantage was Jack Draper, beating the Spaniard in straight sets. 

Since then, Draper has risen from 31st to fourth in the world and plays here as No2 seed to Alcaraz's No1.

The 23-year-old was upset by world No62 Alexander Bublik in the last 16 of the French Open, and had a couple of days off before getting back to work - although he was not tempted to join Alcaraz in heading off to a party island.

‘Everyone's different,' said Draper. ‘I like being at home. I love going back to the UK, to my flat, or to the family home. When I work, I work really hard and I'm always on. It's nice to come back and take my mind off everything.

‘I don't feel the urge to be going out partying and all that stuff. I'd rather just come home.'

One evening after training, Draper settled down in his Putney flat to watch the French Open final. As a man on a mission to chase down Sinner and Alcaraz, it must have been a daunting watch.

‘Unbelievable tennis,' said Draper, who plays tricky American Jenson Brooksby in the first round here. 

‘It inspired all the players, it captured attention around the world, even people who aren't into tennis.

‘I don't know what I'm capable of yet but I aspire to be at that level. What those guys are doing is setting the way and changing the game. Players like myself are going to be working very hard to get to that point.'

As much as Alcaraz switched off from tennis in Ibiza, he could not resist watching a few highlights himself.

‘The bad thing in tennis is sometimes you don't have time to realise what you have done,' said Alcaraz, who will face fellow Spaniard Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in the first round of Queen's. 

‘But I've been talking with my friends, I've been watching highlights and when that moment comes, the love-40, I still can't believe I won at the end of that match. 

'At some point, I had to calm myself and realise I did it.'

Tatjana Maria knocked off four Top 20 players in a row to capture her first WTA 500 title at the HSBC Championships. She becomes the oldest titlist on tour since Serena Williams in 2020.

Thanks to four Top 20 wins in a row, Tatjana Maria has been rewarded with her biggest career title -- as a 37-year-old mother of two.

Queen's Club: Draws | Scores | Order of play

Capping off her incredible week of upsets, German qualifier Maria captured the WTA 500 HSBC Championships title on Sunday with a 6-3, 6-4 final victory over No. 8 seed Amanda Anisimova of the United States.

"It means a lot to me, because I'm 37 years old and I won this trophy today," Maria told the press. "People were always saying, 'Oh, now maybe it's time. You are too old. You are...' Whatever reason they say sometimes. 

"I'm a good example that even in my age you still can win big trophies. I'm super proud of myself that I could win this tournament, because actually, I believed always in it, and my husband too. That's why we kept also going, because there was always this belief that I can win big tournaments and that I can do great things on the court."

Family affair: In their only previous meeting, Maria had beaten Anisimova in Beijing qualifying back in 2018. All these years later, the World No.86 defeated her again with her slice-and-dice game, carving her way to a win after 1 hour and 23 minutes of play.

With her daughters 11-year-old Charlotte and 4-year-old Cecilia joining husband/coach Charles in the front row of the stands, Maria became the oldest singles champion on the Hologic WTA Tour since another returning mother, Serena Williams, won the 2020 Auckland title aged 38.

"It's such a special moment for all of us, like a family together," Maria said. "We won this trophy together, because we stick together and we are doing everything together. So it's not like only me that I won this trophy today. It's like my whole family won this trophy."

Happy return: It is fitting that a veteran player won the title here, given that this was the first time since 1973 that WTA tennis has been contested at the prestigious Queen's Club in London. 52 years after Olga Morozova won the most recent Queen's Club WTA title, Maria follows her on the championship trophy.

With the win, Maria maintained her undefeated record in WTA singles finals, improving to 4-0 when a title is on the line. The German won her first WTA title on grass at Mallorca in 2018, and then she became a Bogota expert, winning that clay-court event back-to-back in 2022 and 2023.

Sunday, though, marked Maria's first career final above WTA 250-level. The step up in level did not faze her, and after beating Top 20 players Karolina Muchova, Elena Rybakina and Madison Keys consecutively to make the championship match, Maria completed her quartet of high-caliber wins with one final triumph.

The only other time Maria had defeated multiple Top 20 players at a single event was during one of her other spectacular grass-court runs -- she ousted Maria Sakkari and Jelena Ostapenko en route to the 2022 Wimbledon semifinals. And, in fact, those were her most recent Top 20 wins until this week.

"In [2022] when I played Wimbledon, I mean, I was fighting for every point, but there were sometimes like a few doubts," Maria said. "This week, actually, I really found my confidence. I was believing in myself from the first till the last point that I could win this. Every single match, actually."

Tale of the tape: Ranked at a new career-high of World No. 15, Anisimova also had a wonderful week, besting Top 10 players Emma Navarro and Zheng Qinwen back-to-back in the last two rounds. It was the first time Anisimova had advanced beyond the quarterfinals of a grass-court WTA event.

But Maria's combo of slices, speed and big serves had proved too strong on the grass this week for every player she faced, and Anisimova was no exception. At one point, Maria won 12 points in a row during her run to a 4-1 lead in Sunday's first set.

Anisimova cranked a rally backhand winner to pull back on serve at 4-3, but Maria refused to yield the momentum, scampering all over the court to win the next two games and clinch the one-set lead. Even with her unorthodox shots, Maria hit only three unforced errors in the first set.

In the second set, Maria raced out to a 4-1 lead again. The German's seventh ace of the day gave her a 5-3 lead, and she served out the match two games later to attain victory.

Muhammad, Schuurs win doubles title: The Queen's Club doubles final followed on Andy Murray Arena, and No. 4 seeds Asia Muhammad and Demi Schuurs squeaked past No. 2 seeds Anna Danilina and Diana Shnaider 7-5, 6-7(3), [10-4] to take the title.

Muhammad and Schuurs were unable to convert two championship points in the second set, but the American-Dutch duo took command in the decisive match-tiebreak to claim victory after 1 hour and 44 minutes.

It's another big title this year for Muhammad and Schuurs, who won WTA 1000 Indian Wells in March. This is Muhammad's 13th career WTA doubles title, and Schuurs' 21st.

Tatjana Maria knocked off four Top 20 players in a row to capture her first WTA 500 title at the HSBC Championships. She becomes the oldest titlist on tour since Serena Williams in 2020.

Jannik Sinner is set to play his first match since the French Open final at the Halle Open, where he'll play a qualifier in the first round. 

Sinner's defeat to Carlos Alcaraz was his first loss in a Grand Slam final, having emerged victorious in his last three finals appearances.

The ATP number one was agonisingly close to securing a maiden Roland Garros crown, but was overcome by the defiant Spaniard, who came back from two sets down to win it all.

In his triumph, Alcaraz joined Novak Djokovic and Gaston Gaudio as the only men in the Open Era to win a Grand Slam final after facing a match point.

It was a tough loss for the Italian to take against his rival, who he discussed ahead of his title defence in Halle. 

Speaking to Tennis TV ahead of the Halle Open, Sinner said of Alcaraz: “At the end of the day, we are rivals, but we still have a great relationship.

“We saw this in the past, that you can be rivals but still friends, and this is what we try to do.

“The last six majors was me and Carlos, but things can change very quickly. The new generation is coming in, there's still Sascha playing incredible tennis, I believe Daniil will come back again strong.

“With me and Carlos, I practice to understand what's working with certain players and what's not.

“I believe in Paris, I was very close, not only results-wise, but also the level was there. Enjoying that level on clay, I hope it's going to give me the confidence to keep going.

“I think we [Alcaraz and I] are important, but as important as any other players. I don't think only two players make the difference. There are 128 players in a Grand Slam, who make the sport very tough.

“I think me and Carlos, we are very happy to be in the position we are in.”

After his French Open run, Wimbledon is now the only Grand Slam that Sinner has never made the final of. 

His best campaign was a semi-final finish in 2023, where he lost to Djokovic in straight sets.

Last year, Sinner reached the quarter-finals of the tournament, after a promising first four matches at the All England Club. 

After beating Yannick Hanfmann in round one, he defeated former Wimbledon finalist and compatriot Matteo Berrettini. 

He then swept aside Miomir Kecmanovic before earning another statement win against 14th seed Ben Shelton. 

Sinner's pursuit of the title was cut short by Daniil Medvedev in the last eight over five sets.

Jannik Sinner admitted he has had "sleepless nights" since losing the French Open final to Carlos Alcaraz in five thrilling sets last week. 

While speaking to reporters in German at his pre-tournament press conference ahead of the Terra Wortman Open, Sinner spoke about both the positives and negatives of dealing with the agonizing loss. 

"I think that for me to play another tournament is positive, because every match is a new beginning, and I must be mentally ready to give my all on the court," Sinner said according to the ATP Tour's website. "Therefore, it is great I can be here in Halle. But yes, I had already a few sleepless nights, but I think every day it gets better.

"My family stand behind me, and my friends. That is the most important thing for me. Tennis is important in my life but nevertheless are family and friends more important. Nonetheless I think often about the match."

Sinner won the first two sets of the match, then earned a quick break of Alcaraz's serve to begin the third set. But the Spaniard, who had never completed a comeback from two sets down in his career before his thrilling victory in the Roland Garros final, fought back and saved three consecutive championship points en route to winning the match in improbable fashion. 

Not only did Sinner thrice lose out on an opportunity to secure the Musketeers' Cup, but he also won one more point than Alcaraz in the entire match, showcasing both how close he came and, yet, how gut-wrenching the defeat was. 

"I still think about those couple of points" 💔@janniksin on *that* Roland-Garros final vs Alcaraz#TWO25 pic.twitter.com/u3ZOFfBE1C

While Sinner admitted he still thinks about those "couple of points," he also took some positives from the loss, namely that he had "never played tennis on clay like this." It's worth noting that Sinner reached this level of play in just his second tournament since returning from a three-month doping suspension. 

He'll now turn his attention to the grass courts in Halle and then the iconic All-England Club for Wimbledon in just two weeks' time.

Novak Djokovic has won everything in tennis and is still performing at the top level on the ATP Tour. 

Djokovic made a deep run at Roland Garros this year, reaching the semi-finals before bowing out to a red-hot Jannik Sinner, proving he's still capable of competing for the grandest prizes in tennis. 

The Serb, however, is not the same player he used to be, and having already hinted at retirement in recent months, is surely not far away from calling it a day on his legendary career. 

After Djokovic won the gold medal at the Paris Olympics, which had eluded him for years, the former world number one was left with just one more feat to achieve in the sport: a 25th Grand Slam title. 

Currently tied with Margaret Court on 24, should he collect one more major crown, he would have more than any man or woman in tennis history.

He's been in pursuit of the record since winning the US Open in 2023, and having recently turned 38, Djokovic‘s window to make history could be closing very soon. 

Since 2023, Djokovic has made the final of a Grand Slam just once, which came at Wimbledon last year, where he met eventual champion Carlos Alcaraz. 

He had played the Spaniard the year before, in what was one of the most thrilling matches at the All England Club to date, going five sets on Centre Court. 

Their 2024 clash, however, saw a much more lopsided encounter, as the Spaniard won in straight sets 6-2, 6-2, 7-6. 

It was a statement victory for the now-world number two, and marked what many thought was potentially the passing of the torch from one generation to another. 

Following that loss, Djokovic crashed out of the US Open later that summer and finished the season as world number seven, his lowest ranking since 2022. 

In 2025, he has struggled to find consistency, suffering first-round exits in Indian Wells, Monte-Carlo, and Madrid, despite making the semi-finals at the Australian Open and Roland Garros. 

Aside from his own game, his biggest problems arise with the recent dominance of Sinner and Alcaraz, who, between them, have won the last six Grand Slam titles. 

The two, aged 22 and 23, will only get better as they enter their prime, and the gap between them and Djokovic will only continue to grow. 

With this, Wimbledon 2025 and potentially the US Open this season are arguably the legend's last chance at doing what no player has ever done before, in securing a quarter-century of major trophies.  

Before the French Open, when speaking to Business Traveller USA, Djokovic said: “Obviously it's challenging for me nowadays to produce the results I had when I was at my best.

“It doesn't mean that I will never be able to do that again, but that greatness changes its shape, and that's because you're a different person on an annual basis, on a monthly basis, on a weekly basis.

“Tennis is a sport where it's necessary to nurture that mentality of, it's never enough.

“Because once it's enough, then it's really enough, and you have to put the racket aside. And I still… I still don't feel it's enough for me.”

Djokovic will not play in either of the ATP 500s, Queen's or the Halle Open, before the Wimbledon championships.

‘S-HERTOGENBOSCH - Gabriel Diallo has won his first ATP Tour title.

The 23-year-old Montreal native defeated Belgium's Zizou Bergs 7-5, 7-6 (8) to win the Libema Open tennis tournament on Sunday.

In what was a tight, back-and-forth second set, Diallo was down 6-4 in the tiebreaker before pulling victory from the jaws of defeat. He got three straight points from then on before eventually taking the win.

“Oh man, I don't have the words. It's something that you dream of for your whole life since you were a little kid, to get an ATP Tour title,” Diallo said in his on-court interview. “The fact that I was able to do it here after losing a final last year, it just means the world to me. 

“I'm very happy, not only for myself but for my whole team.”

Diallo had nine aces, won 76 per cent of his first-serve points and had 23 winners. He also broke on his lone opportunity, while saving his opponent's two break point chances.

The six-foot-eight Diallo was the first Canadian men's singles finalist in event history. He is also just the fourth Canadian to win an ATP Tour singles title this century after Milos Raonic (eight titles), Felix Auger-Aliassime (seven titles) and Denis Shapovalov (three titles).

Diallo will rise 11 spots to a career-high No. 44 in the ATP rankings on Monday. He already guaranteed his top-50 debut by reaching the semifinals.

Jannik Sinner of Italy

Just a week after the dramatic Roland Garros final, Jannik Sinner appears to have moved on from the disappointment in Paris and is already looking ahead to new goals—chiefly, Wimbledon. 

Before that, however, he will defend his title at the ATP 500 tournament in Halle, Germany, where he triumphed last season.

Jannik Sinner of Italy

The Italian, hailing from San Candido, is embracing a philosophical outlook to process the heartbreaking loss at Roland Garros, where he held a two-set lead and had three match points before ultimately falling to Carlos Alcaraz.

Still, Sinner remains focused on the positives from the experience in Paris. "Roland Garros didn't end the way I would've liked, but there are reasons to be satisfied," he said.

"It's a matter of perspective. You can dwell on the three match points I missed, or you can see it as the best clay-court match I've ever played. Carlos Alcaraz is a very strong player after all," explained the world No. 1.

"I played five hours without any physical issues," Sinner emphasized. Since the final, he's taken time off to recover and recharge before resuming competition in Halle. Throughout the past week, he made a conscious effort to unplug.

"I spent a few days with friends and family. I enjoyed myself and had fun doing simple things. For me, it's important to find time for normal moments. I'm fortunate to be surrounded by people who love and care about me," he added.

Sinner will begin his title defense in Halle this coming Tuesday, although he will get his first taste of grass on Sunday, partnering with Lorenzo Sonego in doubles.

The world No. 1 will open against a qualifier and could potentially face past champions later in the draw. Notably, he may meet Kazakhstan's Alexander Bublik—2022 champion—in the second round, and Poland's Hubert Hurkacz—2021 winner—in the quarterfinals.

Looking further ahead to the semifinals, Sinner could be challenged by top-tier competitors such as Russians Andrey Rublev and Karen Khachanov, or Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime.

On the opposite half of the Halle draw is second seed Alexander Zverev, a finalist in 2016 and 2017. 

He begins his campaign against American Marcos Giron and could later face former Halle champion Ugo Humbert, who opens against Canada's Denis Shapovalov.

Also competing in Zverev's section are Italy's Lorenzo Sonego, Germany's Jan-Lennard Struff, breakout Brazilian star Joao Fonseca, and top names like Russia's Daniil Medvedev and Greece's Stefanos Tsitsipas—who is starting a new chapter under coach Goran Ivanisevic.

American alpine ski racer Lindsey Vonn shared a sarcastic reaction to current ATP No. 1 Jannik Sinner appearing to be shocked to the questions being thrown at him in German before the start of the Halle Open 2025. The Italian will be in action on Monday, June 16, during the tournament.

Sinner will be teaming up with his compatriot, Lorenzo Sonego, to face the pair of Alex Michelsen and Karen Khachanov in the Round of 16 stage. Just a couple of days before the start of Sinner's exploits in the tournament, he sat down for an interview, during which the interviewer asked him questions in German.

Shocked by the questions, the Italian carefully listened to the questions and came up with a sarcastic reaction. Sinner said:

Lindsey Vonn reacted to this part of the interview on Instagram and dropped a few laughing emojis in the comments section.

Lindsey Vonn has been an admirer of Jannik Sinner for the last few years. The veteran ski racer is seen occasionally praising the Italian for his qualities on and off the court.

Jannik Sinner made his feelings known on his emotions after defeat to Carlos Alcaraz in the finals of the 2025 Roland Garros. The Italian started well, winning the first two sets with ease, but the Spaniard turned the match on his head to win the next three and defend his title successfully.

Notably, this was Sinner's second straight tournament finals loss to Alcaraz after the Italian Open in May. Sinner shared that he faced several sleepless nights after this defeat, and moving to a new tournament (Halle Open 2025) has been a positive for him. He said (via ATP Tour):

During the conversation, Sinner also mentioned the upcoming grass court season, stating that he uplifted his performance last year and is looking what this year has in store for him.

Aryna Sabalenka may have come up agonisingly short in the French Open final but the 27-year-old appeared to be unfazed as she enjoyed a holiday with her boyfriend in Mykonos. 

Coco Gauff got the better of the Belarusian at Roland Garros but Sabalenka put her disappointment behind her with a pre-Wimbledon getaway on the Greek island.

Sabalenka took to Instagram to share a series of photos of herself and Georgios Frangulis enjoying their break.

The tennis star has been with the Oakberry founder and racecar driver Frangulis since early 2024.

Sabalenka's rise to the world No1 ranking came despite tragedy last year when her ex-boyfriend Konstantin Koltsov tragically died of a reported suicide after jumping from a hotel balcony in Miami.

Former NHL player and fellow Belarusian Konstantin Koltsov died at the age of 42 after falling from a balcony on the 23rd floor of a Miami five-star hotel.

Sabalenka had revealed her plans to enjoy 'sugar and alcohol' in Mykonos in the aftermath of her 6-7, 6-2, 6-4 loss to Gauff in one of the great women's finals of the decade.

‘I already have a flight booked to Mykonos and alcohol, sugar. I just need couple of days to completely forget about this crazy world and this crazy, if I could swear, I would swear right now, but this crazy thing that happened today,' Sabalenka said post-match.

‘I think everyone understands. I'm just trying to be very polite right now, but there is no other word that could describe what just happened today on the court.

‘Tequila, gummy bears and swimming, being like a tourist for a couple of days.'

This marked the second Grand Slam of Gauff's career, having also claimed the 2023 US Open title. The world No 2 became the first American to win the French Open since Serena Williams in 2015.

In an press-conference after the final, Sabalenka argued that the three-time defending champion Iga Swiatek would have beaten Gauff had beaten her in their semi-final.

Sabalenka said: 'That hurts. Especially when I've been playing really great tennis during the whole week. A lot of tough opponents, Iga.

'I think if Iga would have beaten me, she would go out today and she would get the win.'

Gauff parried the claim away and cited her victory in straight sets against Swiatek at the Madrid Open earlier this year, which was also on clay.

Gauff rebutted: 'I mean, I don't agree with that. I'm here sitting here (with the trophy). Last time I played - no shade to Iga or anything, but I played her and I won in straight sets (in Madrid).

'I don't think that's a fair thing to say, because anything can happen. The way Aryna was playing the last few weeks, she was the favourite to win the title. If you asked me, honestly, who I wanted to play, it was Iga just because I felt Aryna was playing so good, and she was.

'But regardless of who I played, I think I had a good shot to win. I definitely had that belief.'

Sabalenka made 70 unforced errors in blustery conditions, and said: 'It felt like a joke. Like somebody from above was laughing: let's see if you can handle this.

'After two weeks of incredible tennis, in the final in terrible conditions to play such terrible tennis really hurts.

'It felt like she (Gauff) was hitting the ball off the frame and somehow magically it lands in the court. I don't think she won the match because she played incredible, just because I made all those mistakes.'

Coco Gauff got the better of the Belarusian at Roland Garros in an epic encounter

Sabalenka's break from the court comes ahead of Wimbledon, where the world No1 will start as pre-tournament favourite as she bids to triumph at the All-England Club for the first time in her career.

She was forced to pull out of last year's tournament through injury and was blocked from entering in 2022 due to a ban on Russian and Belarusian players amid the war in Ukraine.

Sabalenka, however, has reached the semi-finals on her last two appearances at Wimbledon in 2021 and 2023.

She will look to hone her preparations following the break by playing at the Berlin Open, a grass court tournament, this week.

Madison Keys believes that Coco Gauff will not “care” about the ongoing fallout from comments made by Aryna Sabalenka after the French Open final.

World No 2 Gauff battled from a set down to beat world No 1 Sabalenka 6-7(5), 6-2, 6-4 in an enthralling match at Roland Garros, lifting her second Grand Slam singles title.

However, the match has been partially overshadowed by comments made by Sabalenka in the aftermath of her defeat.

The three-time Grand Slam champion initially apologised to the crowd for her performance in her post-match speech on court, while congratulating Gauff for her victory.

But, in her press conference, Sabalenka then claimed that her unforced errors had been key to the final, and that Iga Swiatek, whom she beat in the semi-final, would have beaten Gauff.

Sabalenka later clarified her comments and gave credit to Gauff, though the world No 1 has continued to face criticism over the past week.

Criticism has been particularly notable in the US, where Gauff has been making several TV and media appearances since her historic triumph.

The 21-year-old handed Sabalenka her second Grand Slam final defeat of 2025, after the Belarusian was beaten by Keys in the Australian Open final.

Competing at the Queen's Club this week, Keys was asked how she would have responded should Sabalenka or any opponent have made similar comments about a final she had played in.

In response, the 30-year-old claimed that she would not “really care” – and expressed her belief that Gauff would feel the same way.

“To be honest, I don't think I would really care, especially if I had won, no matter what they say or think,” said Keys.

“It's tough. It's a complicated, emotional moment, and I think sometimes emotions bring everything out of people. Things are said in a way and not necessarily meant seriously.

“Other times, you feel very disappointed with yourself because you haven't played at the level you expected. I think sometimes it's hard to overcome those moments, especially if you have a microphone in front of you.

“Sometimes we say things we later regret. Again, I don't think Coco would care.”

Sabalenka and Gauff are set to return to action at the Berlin Tennis Open this week, with the pair the top two seeds, and once again projected to meet in the final.

Both have received a bye in the opening round of action, with Sabalenka set to face a qualifier and Gauff facing either a qualifier or Daria Kasatkina.

Sabalenka reached the quarter-final of the event last year before retiring with a shoulder injury, ultimately pulling out of Wimbledon, while Gauff reached the last four before falling to Jessica Pegula.

Gauff could again face compatriot Pegula in Berlin this summer, with the defending champion seeded third at the WTA 500 event and projected to face the world No 2 in the semi-final.

Keys is the seventh seed at the tournament and begins her campaign against former Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova.

She is projected to face fourth seed Jasmine Paolini in the quarter-final, and is on the same side of the draw as Sabalenka.

Born to tennis royalty, Draper's supreme work ethic and ascent up the rankings in the past 12 months have been astonishing. Here's why Kieran Jackson believes he poses a serious challenge to Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner for the Wimbledon title

To pinpoint the exact moment where British No 1 Jack Draper launched his ascent to the upper echelons of men's tennis, you'd need only go back 12 months this very weekend. 

Off the back of a disappointing first-round exit at the 2024 French Open, Draper broke his ATP title duck with a statement triumph on the grass in Stuttgart. That week, as he has since acknowledged, something clicked in his big-hitting, flamboyant lefty game. 

A few days later, the Brit outgunned Carlos Alcaraz at Queen's. While the Spaniard would go on to win his second title at SW19 a few weeks later, Draper slumped to a disappointing second-round loss to compatriot Cameron Norrie.

However, what has followed has been splendid. A US Open semi-final, a title in Vienna last October and a Masters 1000 victory in Indian Wells in March – a tournament seen by many as the fifth Grand Slam. Yet, most impressive of all? A newfound physical and mental resilience to compete with the very best, week in, week out. 

The net result? A career-high ranking of world No 4 for the 23-year-old from Sutton. Frustratingly, he will enter Queen's on Monday at No 5, behind Novak Djokovic, with his Stuttgart points dropping off. But the race to be fourth seed at Wimbledon – with the prospect of avoiding the likes of Jannik Sinner, Alexander Zverev and Alcaraz until the semi-final – is very much on, as Draper returns to Queen's this week.

The summer of '24 was a huge turning point. Draper, the son of former LTA chief executive Roger and ex-British junior tennis champion Nicky, has struggled immensely with injuries and physical fitness since turning professional in 2021. Shoulder and hip issues – remember Andy Murray's issues with the latter – have plagued him, while he has regularly vomited on court in humid conditions. 

“Coming into last year, the only goal was to stay fit and healthy,” Draper's long-term coach, James Trotman, told the ATP website in March. Interestingly, Draper's short-term coaching trial with South African ex-pro Wayne Ferreira last summer did not last more than a few months, with the Brit ultimately placing complete trust in Trotman, who is double his age at 46. 

“We were at the point where it didn't matter how good he could be, or was going to be, our focus was to keep him fit. It's challenging to build up trust in your body again. It's not something that happens instantly. This has been a long journey.

”It wasn't just one injury, it was three or four on the back of each other. I thought that was enough. ‘What are we going to do here, Jack? Who are the people we're going to put around you?' That was the first objective. It's okay to fail, but if we do, it's not because we're not trying.”

Sporting a backwards cap at all times – Lleyton Hewitt-esque – Draper emits something of a braggadocio persona; yet that could not be further from the truth. First emerging in the public eye in 2018, Draper reached the final of junior Wimbledon, winning a marathon semi-final 19-17 in the final set after four hours and 23 minutes. His heart in the heat of battle has never wavered. Quickly, he was elevated to the role of hitting partner for the Great Britain Davis Cup team. 

“There was a lot of potential there,” Trotman said of Draper, the junior. “He was very small until the age of 15 or 16. He grew up as a smaller player, having to compete against bigger guys, having to defend and find ways of being competitive against the stronger players who could hit him off the court.

“His identity from a young age was to be a little bit more defensive. All of a sudden, he grows to 6' 4” and he's serving out of a tree and hitting the ball big. A big part of that coaching journey that we're still on today is to try and impose his weapons on the court and take the racquet out of his opponent's hand.”

Draper was also able to learn from Murray during the latter stages of his career as part of the Davis Cup team, while showcasing his personality. Notably, GB's celebrations on the way back from the 2023 victory over France, where a young Draper, in a bucket hat and sipping a beer, belted out The Proclaimers' classic “500 Miles”, with the viral video showing an unimpressed Murray.

Whilst his raw ability – his fierce serve and swashbuckling forehand are his two greatest assets – has never been in doubt, his fitness over best-of-five set tennis has often been placed under the microscope. In fact, not unlike the early stages of Murray's career. Pleasingly, Draper dedicated his most recent off-season, when nursing a hip injury, to his physical conditioning and notably employed a breathing coach.

“I had a lot of problems with my sinuses when I was younger so I breathe a lot through my mouth,” explained Draper, having come through three back-to-back five-set matches at the Australian Open in January. 

“When you are anxious or have long points and you have to recover quickly, it's not efficient to breathe through your mouth. So, I've been trying to reverse what I do and breathe through my nose a lot more.”

Fast-forward six months, Draper is one of the fittest athletes on tour. So much so that the effervescent Alexander Bublik, prior to beating the Brit in the fourth round, said to him at Roland Garros: “Are you getting ready for UFC?!”

Now firmly rooted in the top 10 in the rankings, Draper does not want his upward trajectory to stop. The Putney resident was back on court at Queen's ahead of the tournament, hitting with former world No 14 Kyle Edmund, who knows a thing or two about career-impacting injuries. 

Draper will play just one warm-up tournament, at Queen's, before Wimbledon. While still a step short of Sinner and Alcaraz's insane level of consistency, as shown by their magnificent five-hour-plus Roland-Garros final, the Briton has the potential to cause an upset if either player has an off day. 

He has beaten both Sinner and Alcaraz at Queen's, in 2021 and 2024. His hard-hitting game is well-suited to the quick nature of grass-court tennis. And should the draw surprisingly open up at any point, he will be ready to pounce at SW19.

Annabel Croft, one time girls' Wimbledon winner, tennis commentator, pundit and Strictly semi-finalist, recently found a piece of English homework from when she was eleven in 1978. It was entitled “What I Would Like to Do”.

She had picked up a tennis racket only two years earlier, during a family holiday in Spain. In the ensuing decade, little did she know that she would become Britain's brightest young female tennis star. “I would like to be able to… win Wimbledon,” she wrote. “Before I get to [sic] old, I would like to dance on stage… before I am to [sic] old I would like to get married because if you are too [sic] old you cannot have children… Also, your husband protects you.”

This afternoon, we are sitting at the kitchen island in Croft's six-bedroom neo-classical home, designed by her late husband Mel Coleman twenty five years ago. The house, part of a gated estate in Kingston, is a short drive away from the grass courts of Wimbledon. When Croft was selected for the main draw there at the age of 15, she was the youngest to play there for 95 years. In 1984, a month before her 18th birthday, she won the girls' junior title.

It's hard to square that Croft is now 58-years-old – 59 next month. She doesn't look that different from the press cuttings of thirty-five years ago, which are stacked up in the hallway as she prepares for a 28-date speaking tour about her life this September.

She does a lot of walking and yoga these days, as well as playing tennis – and it shows. Wearing a Me+Em brown linen jumpsuit and mules, she has a baked-in tan (she founded her Annabel Croft academy in Portugal, which Coleman oversaw until he died two years ago). Her famous mane of hair, always tied back in a high pony or plait when she was the Raducanu of her day, now cascades around her shoulders.

The French Open is on in the background. “That was incredible,” she says after Aryna Sabalenka catches out Coco Gauff, before the ultimate glory was claimed by Gauff, who Croft is rooting for to win Wimbledon.

Croft spent the first ten days of this year's Roland Garros commentating for BBC Radio Five Live. Tomorrow, two of her three children, Amber Rose, 30 (six months pregnant) and Charlie, 29 (about to get married), are coming over for lunch to watch the men's final between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, a game that lasted 5hr 29 mins; the second longest in grand slam history. Her youngest daughter, Lily, 26, lives in Dubai.

This week, Croft is getting ready to begin commentating at the HSBC Championships at the Queen's Club, as women's events return there for the first time since 1973. Ten members of the women's top 20 will be playing, including Katie Boulter and Emma Raducanu. When I ask if she has “special interests”, she murmurs about Alcaraz and Raducanu, the former for being so utterly brilliant, thought of as the new Nadal, the latter because her trajectory has been so uneven, yet her promise never diminished.

It has been two years since Croft did the splits on Strictly, reaching fourth place, dancing with the energy, stamina and natural skill that must initially have surprised both her partner, Johannes Radebe, now one of her best friends, and the judges. It felt like every step was imbued with the emotion of her personal tragedy.

Mel Coleman died at Kingston Hospital in May 2023, just 12 weeks after he was diagnosed with Stage four colon cancer, which had spread throughout his body; 97 per cent of his liver was covered with tumours. Her husband of 30 years, they married in 1993 two days before her 27th birthday but they first met when she was just 21; she was in Sri Lanka making a TV show about learning to sail – Coleman was part of the sailing crew. She shows me an old VCR tape: “The moment I first met him and shook his hand is captured right here.” Then, Coleman was an America's Cup and Admiral's Cup sailor, before switching to investment banking.

Not long after meeting him Croft made the decision to retire from tennis. She was 21, ranked 24th in the world but had become tired of the tennis life, of hanging around in motels trying to scrabble enough for the bus fare to the next tournament: “I knew I didn't want to live my life as a tennis player until I was 30. I was emotionally intelligent early on to have worked that out.”

Sensing the happiness to be found in normal life off the circuit, and given, by then, she was something of a household name, she moved into entertainment: “There wasn't a Sky TV, or Eurosport so I couldn't move straight into commentary. I had to find other ways to make money.”

She began doing pantomime: “I needed the panto to give me confidence. If you force yourself into uncomfortable places you suddenly realise it's not as terrifying as you thought.”

Immediately after her retirement in 1988 she took over from Anneka Rice on Channel 4's Treasure Hunt. “I was always someone who thought you can't sit back and wait for things to come to you. You have to make things happen. No one gets up in the morning and thinks ‘I'm going to help Annabel today.'”

“We grew together,” she says of Coleman. She gestures around the house, and points outside to the tennis court: “The court was the first thing we put in.” When Coleman died, the couple had been in the process of planning their retirement, selling this house and relocating down the road to a smaller one. Every night, at bedtime Coleman told her he'd miss her until the morning: “I didn't know I had an incredible marriage, but I did,” she says. She is composed. Her grief is not as raw as it was after Strictly, now it “comes in rain showers, but they are getting less – and then it's gone.”

“You know he died of sepsis?” she asks me. The cancer had spread – he eschewed the opportunity for chemo for a better quality of life, and it's thought a tumour perforated on a flight back from Portugal. On his return, he was admitted as an emergency.

His death was as sudden as his diagnosis (both, she says, badly handled by Kingston Hospital). By July – “literally within a few weeks [of losing him] I was on the phone to my agent. He said ‘I've signed you up to Strictly. You're giving an interview tomorrow because they are announcing it.' I don't know what I would have done without being busy. I would have sunk.”

Strictly, she says, saved her – it also gave her Radebe – “we are bonded for life”. He calls her all the time. Sometimes they talk for two hours. “He's part of the family now,” she says, and shows me a picture of him lined up with her children: “Look! He's wearing Mel's sliders there.”

Her 1978 A4 homework is on the table in front of us. “Nice ideas,” her English teacher wrote. It's as though Croft foretold her life, minus the tragedy. “But there is so much to be positive about,” she says. By September, she will be a grandmother and she has properly rediscovered dance. During the tour, she will dance on stage: “I don't want to be a professional widow. I understand that a lot of people can identify with what I've been through, but I don't want grief to define me.

“People say I have been so generous with my emotions, but I have always been like that. Strictly was so helpful to me. I realised how much I loved dancing and I've wondered whether I went down the wrong path [with tennis] when I might have been a dancer instead.”

Two years on from Strictly, she is in the process of downsizing: “I mean, it's too big!” she says, “it's ridiculous. I'm rattling around here. The house has served its purpose.” She is clearing three decades of family life, including Coleman's possessions, his clothes and shoes. The family baby grand which sat in the hallway for twenty-five years has already gone. She's gravitating towards her eldest daughter (and her imminent grandchild) in Battersea, near enough to her friends and to Wimbledon. “Mel had always wanted a water view [because of his sailing] and I do too because it will connect me to him.”

Croft grew up in Farnborough, Kent, in a comfortable home with two siblings, an older brother and a younger sister. Her parents, James, a chartered surveyor, and Susan, a housewife, were “keen tennis players” but neither of them coaches or professionals.

They had a tennis court in the garden but it was at a Spanish hotel tennis tournament that she caught the bug. Her mother then started driving her 20 minutes to Park Langley tennis club in Beckenham, dropping her off “with 50p in my pocket for the cost of my lesson, a packet of crisps and a drink of squash, and I'd stay there all day. It was forehands on a Monday, backhands on a Tuesday, Wednesday was volleys, Thursdays serves and then playing points.”

She shows me a collection of childhood log books with scores: lists and lists of tennis partners – mostly boys – whom she organised into being her opponents. But she'd play anybody, often “wily old dogs”. What is telling about this is the extent of her drive.

“I'd have charts up on the fridge. It totally came from me. It should always come from the child. I met one of those boys recently and he said ‘I used to love coming to you because you always bossed us around and set all the drills. You organised everything.'”

As she started to hit a different league, she missed more and more school: “My dad was always writing requests to the head mistress to ask for time off: ‘Annabel won't be there on Friday, Annabel will miss this week for a tournament'. Slowly I dropped subjects until I was just down to maths, English and sport. I once sat a geography test, turned over the page and realised I didn't know a single thing.”

At fifteen, she moved to Houston, Texas for five years to train with a coach, who was the mixed doubles partner to Billie Jean King.“I travelled around the world six or seven times – that was my education. But it's so gladiatorial. It's like a boxing match.”

She plays me an audio clip of a match with “an American girl” at the Albert Hall, with Des Lynam commentating: “I'd had hypnotherapy before that”. She suffered badly from nerves. Would a sports psychologist have helped her? Made a difference to your longevity? I ask: “I don't think so. I knew myself.”

She is adamant that she made the right decision to retire. Today, there is an added pressure: Raducanu has recently had to deal with a creepy superfan who was evicted the Dubai Tennis Championships, “but [sadly] that comes with the territory,” says Croft. “There's way more security now, but what has changed is the birth of social media. Tennis players today, if they lose matches, get abuse from betting people who are going to lose a lot of money on somebody's match, and then they start attacking the player. That is a lot of stress and pressure. I wouldn't have been able to take that.”

Her life in retirement was about pushing on, pushing through the pain barrier in a different way: “Sometimes I'd be on the floor with a panic attack [with speaking engagements] but it was Bear Grylls who gave me the best advice. Mel is godfather to his first son. He said “Annabel, don't try to be somebody you are not.”

Perhaps it is because she is, as she says, “a naturally sunny person” that she has fared so well on mainstream television. She shows me a tabloid from 1988 where she's on the front page wearing a bikini, publicising her role in the Channel 4 reality show Survivor, which involved a group of people attempting to survive on a deserted island. There are photographs in Hello – it's easy to forget how famous she was back then.

I can see why she invites such love and loyalty: “My oldest friend from when I was seven often comes to stay with her husband.” Her children have gathered around her. Her son Charlie phones her every day during his coffee break: “They are always asking ‘what are your plans, who are you having dinner with? Come and join us!'” But she's a very long way from thinking of another partner, “I can't think about it at the moment. I just really can't.”

“I want to simplify my life, maybe go on walking holidays and be close to family to help. I don't have a driving ambition anymore [but] I am probably kidding myself when I think I would be happy if I just did nothing. If there is one message I have in my tour, it is do something that makes you happy because you never know what is round the corner.”

Coleman was an investment banker for about 18 years, commuting on the tube and sitting behind a desk, but he was “a free-spirited yachtsman” whom Croft says should never have had an office job: “I used to call him Crocodile Dundee.” The white van they converted into “Vannabel” for camping holidays sits on the drive: “It's a difficult one. I don't know what to do with it.”

Coleman's treatment during his illness has left its mark. The delivery of his diagnosis was blunt, but it was his end-of-life care that was truly horrific. The news of his imminent death was broken to Croft and the family callously by a nurse, as Coleman lay within earshot.

This time, it was Croft who wanted to protect him, the 6ft 4in towering man she nicknamed “Mr Incredible”, who only three months earlier had been entertaining everyone, able to fix everything in the house. The lack of kindness in this worst moment was incomprehensible to her. She says “I have had several meetings since and I've received an apology from the hospital.” She still finds it hard to discuss: “It's such an awful subject. We don't need to talk about it now. Maybe sometime over a glass of wine.”

Mercifully, she says, in the 12 weeks leading up to Coleman's death, both of them had been supported by Dr Isabella Cooper, a biochemist specialising in mitochondria, leading a team of cancer researchers at Westminster Hospital. Through a strict ketogenic diet (based on eliminating sugar, low carb, meat heavy) Dr Isabella Cooper reduced the tumour coverage on Coleman's liver from 97 per cent to 70 percent.

It appeared that his new diet was holding the disease back, before the sepsis set in: “I'm at peace with the fact that Mel died with hope, rather than no hope.” Croft says. “Isabella gave us so much hope. She was the only person who gave Mel hope. And if one positive thing can come out of losing Mel, I would love to give a platform to her work.”

She still talks to Cooper every day and now follows a mostly sugar-free diet. She opens her fridge to show me streaky bacon without sugar additives and smoked salmon with no hidden sugars: “I have a huge appetite,” she says. You've got to be kidding? “Oh yes! I ate the same amount as Mel.”

“But I have a very high metabolism and my children say to me ‘slow down'.”

There is something very old school about Annabel Croft, much like Wimbledon itself. This month Croft will again be part of the BBC's commentary lineup at the tournament. Shortly after Strictly, she appeared at the Princess of Wales' trophy presentation, interviewing the Wimbledon winners. “The standards at Wimbledon are incredibly high,” she says. “Everything is immaculate, from the manicured plants to the seating to not a cable being out of place.”

However, this year will be the first tournament without human line judges, replaced by AI-powered cameras: “I'm torn. I'd rather have the correct line call if somebody's Grand Slam is riding on a bad call [from a judge]. People do have less attention span and it will speed tennis up, but the line judges are full of personality and it makes tennis entertaining.”

I can't draw her to express a view on the thorny issue of trans women competing in female categories. “I'm not in a place where I want to attract unwanted aggression towards me.” But I can tell she does have views, “Maybe if I'd retired I'd express a view. I do think there isn't enough debate anymore – or humour. Certain subjects have been shut down, we have not been allowed to debate them.”

Croft is a big fan of TCW (formerly called The Conservative Woman) the online magazine and podcast created by her friend Kathy Gyngell to defend freedom of speech and challenge Left-liberal thinking: “I adore her. She is a woman who will stand up for what she believes in. She is the brightest woman I have ever met. I admire her courage.”

Courage is a good word for Croft too – and resilience: “Ooh I should use that word more.” In the space of two years, she has gone from not knowing how online banking works – “Mel did all of that” – to being able to take the back of the tumble dryer to fix it: “I remember seeing him do it. When it broke down, I went and got his tool box.” Water streamed through the roof shortly after he died – she dealt with that. She can pump up a car tyre as well.

“Mel's watching over me and teaching me a lot. I probably would have gone my whole life never doing these things had Mel been around. But I can do it all now. I've learned I can do things on my own, things I didn't ever think I could.”

George Russell claimed his first pole position of the 2025 season for the Canadian Grand Prix, pipping Max Verstappen to top spot.

Both the Mercedes and Red Bull drivers improved with their final efforts at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve, which also came on the medium Pirelli tyre as opposed to the softest compound of rubber available.

After nine races of Max Verstappen and the McLarens duking it out for Saturday honours, in Canada we have a new game in town, with George Russell on pole for the second year in a row in Montreal.

Pirelli have gone a step softer in their range this season so we're likely to get graining, and multiple stops – and it's a rare year when the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve doesn't produce a Safety Car or two. Teams are demonstrating different approaches in their tyre choices and all the evidence suggests there's a fierce strategy battle to be fought today…

Lando Norris believes that "too many mistakes" and pushing "a bit hard" during a challenging Qualifying for the Canadian Grand Prix was what left him down in seventh on the grid.

The McLaren driver had shown impressive pace during the earlier segments of Qualifying in Montreal, which included topping Q1 and finishing second in Q2.

But the Briton was left on the back foot in Q3, running wide at the final chicane with his first effort before putting in another attempt which left him with a 1m 11.625s.

While others, including polesitter George Russell and team mate Oscar Piastri improved with their final attempts, Norris failed to find time and will start seventh for Sunday's race.

The McLaren duo had also opted against using the medium compound of Pirelli tyre in the final stages, with Russell and Max Verstappen opting to use the C5 option instead of the soft C6 to lock out the front row.

"I just pushed a bit hard and too many mistakes," said Norris post-session as he reflected on his lower than hoped for grid slot.

When asked what might have been possible, he replied: "Good enough for a top three, probably not good enough for pole.

"Hard to know how much was maybe the medium tyre performing that little bit better, especially when the grip comes up. Maybe the medium is a touch better but it was a gamble.

"It was a risk and I guess every team has their own opinion on what they thought was best and clearly we didn't think that was going to be better. But we did what we did and I just didn't put it together when I needed to."

Norris trails Piastri by 10 points in the Drivers' Championship and will have Kimi Antonelli, Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso between himself and his main title rival, with Norris believing it will be difficult to make much headway in the Grand Prix.

"It's tough to say," said Norris. "I think we're maybe a little bit quicker than some of the cars ahead but not all of them. Top five is probably a good start."

Donald Trump vetoed an Israeli plan to kill Iran‘s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, U.S. officials told Reuters and The Associated Press (AP). 


	The Israeli government discussed the proposed plan with the Trump administration in recent days, and the president balked at it, an anonymous U.S. official told the AP. 


	“Have the Iranians killed an American yet? No. Until they do we're not even talking about going after the political leadership,” an anonymous U.S. official told Reuters, which first reported the news.


	When asked about the plot on Fox News' Special Report with Bret Baier, Netanyahu declined to comment, adding, “But I can tell you, I think that we do what we need to do, we'll do what we need to do. And I think the United States knows what is good for the United States.”


Israel has launched strikes against Iran, killing at least 406 people and wounding 654, according to Washington-based Human Rights Activists, the AP reported. Israel opened with strike on an Iranian nuclear facility Friday that killed a number of top generals and nuclear scientists. In retaliation, Iran launched missile strikes on Israel, some of which penetrated the nation's Iron Dome missile defense and landed in Tel Aviv. Israel's government said that 14 people have been killed in strikes since Friday and another 390 have been wounded.

	Trump posted Sunday about the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran in a message on Truth Social. “Iran and Israel should make a deal, and will make a deal,” the president wrote, taking credit for recent de-escalation between India and Pakistan. He added, “We will have PEACE, soon, between Israel and Iran! Many calls and meetings now taking place. I do a lot, and never get credit for anything, but that's OK, the PEOPLE understand. MAKE THE MIDDLE EAST GREAT AGAIN!”

	











	In a post hours earlier, Trump said the United States “had nothing to do with the attack on Iran, tonight.” 


	“If we are attacked in any way, shape or form by Iran, the full strength and might of the U.S. Armed Forces will come down on you at levels never seen before,” he threatened.


	Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has said that if Israel stops its assault, then “our responses will also stop.”


	Netanyahu said Sunday that Israel will halt its attacks if Iran agrees to U.S. demands that the nation dismantle its nuclear capabilities. He also called the Iranian regime “very weak.”


	“The issue here is stopping those things that will threaten our survival. And we're committed to stopping them, and I think we can achieve them,” Netanyahu said on Fox News. “Now, if they are willing to accept President Trump's terms, that's another matter.”

	Trump has said that “Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon” and “can't have enrichment.”


	If Iran does not agree to Trump's demands, then Netanyahu said the conflict will “end when we remove those capacities, and we will.”

The Colombian-born superstar moved to Miami as a teenager to pursue a music career.

	Mitchell Peters



Shakira is opening up about her experience as an immigrant living in the United States under President Donald Trump's immigration policies.


	In a new interview with the BBC, the 48-year-old Colombian-born superstar reflected on how the country has changed since she first moved to Miami as a teenager in the mid-1990s to pursue a music career.


	“I was only 19 when I moved to the U.S., like many other Colombian immigrants who come to this country looking for a better future,” Shakira said, noting that she read works by Leonard Cohen, Walt Whitman and Bob Dylan to learn English and understand the craft of songwriting.


	A longtime advocate for social justice, the “Hips Don't Lie” singer also addressed the challenges facing the Latin community following Trump's return to the White House. Since stepping back into office earlier this year, the president has intensified efforts to combat alleged immigration violations, prompting protests in Los Angeles and across the country in response to raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	“It means living in constant fear,” Shakira told the BBC when asked what it's like to be an immigrant in the U.S. today. “And it's painful to see.”

	











	She added, “Now, more than ever, we have to remain united. Now, more than ever, we have to raise our voices and make it very clear that a country can change its immigration policies, but the treatment of all people must always be humane.”


	In early February, while accepting the Grammy Award for best Latin pop album for 2024's Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran, Shakira dedicated the honor to “all my immigrant brothers and sisters in this country,” adding, “You're loved, worth it and I will always fight with you.”


	Shakira is among a growing number of musicians speaking out against federal immigration raids in Southern California. Following President Trump's early June deployment of National Guard troops to L.A., artists including Olivia Rodrigo, Tyler, The Creator, Finneas, The Game, Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong, Kehlani, Tom Morello, Reneé Rapp and Rebecca Black have publicly condemned the administration's actions.


	“I've lived in LA my whole life and I'm deeply upset about these violent deportations of my neighbors under the current administration,” Rodrigo wrote on her Instagram Story on Saturday (June 14). “LA simply wouldn't exist without immigrants. Treating hardworking community members with such little respect, empathy, and due process is awful. I stand with the beautiful, diverse community of Los Angeles and with immigrants all across America. I stand for our right to freedom of speech and freedom to protest.”


	The 22-year-old pop star and actress also shared a photo from what appeared to be a protest featuring a poster with a crossed-out crown and the words “in our USA,” a likely a reference to the “No Kings Day” demonstrations held on June 14 in response to Trump's 79th birthday military parade in Washington, D.C.

	Internet trolls are making a mockery of Donald Trump‘s beloved military parade that took place Saturday in Washington, D.C., on the president's birthday, though it was ostensibly in honor of the U.S. Army's 250th birthday. 


	Accounts on X (formerly Twitter) shared video of other countries' military parades with soldiers marching in synchronized lockstep surrounded by enthusiastic and large crowds, comparing them to the spectacle in D.C. on Saturday.


	One account, which Puck News' Julia Ioffe identified as Russian, juxtaposed footage of members of the North Korean military marching in exact sync, comparing it to video of U.S. Army troops marching in Trump's parade accompanied by much less fanfare. 


	“How Trump imagined his parade [vs] What he actually saw,” the caption read, according to Ioffe. The contrast is staggering, as the North Korean troops high-stepped in perfect unison compared to the Army's less synchronized and seemingly less enthusiastic marching. Some have pointed out that members of the U.S. Army may have been ordered to march in “Route Step March” or “At Ease March,” a more relaxed and less rigorous type of marching.

	One account posted video of Mexico's annual Mexican Independence Day parade in Mexico City, while another shared footage of India's Republic Day parade.

	Trump has praised other countries for their military parades. When he watched a 2017 Bastille Day celebration in France, Trump told reporters, “It was one of the greatest parades I've ever seen… We're going to have to try to top it.”

	











Washington Post columnist Karen Tumulty pointed out that Trump's admiration of military spectacle goes even farther back. Before he was inaugurated to his first term, Trump told Tumulty in an interview, “We're going to show the people as we build up our military, we're going to display our military.” 


	“That military may come marching down Pennsylvania Avenue,” Trump continued. “That military may be flying over New York City and Washington, D.C., for parades. I mean, we're going to be showing our military.”

	Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said called the parade “a vulgar display” during a news conference on Friday. “It's the kind of thing you see Kim Jong Un, you see Putin, you see with dictators around the world that are weak,” he said.


	Meanwhile, as Trump was celebrating his the Army's birthday in D.C., which reportedly cost up to $45 million, masses of people that dwarfed the parade turnout showed up across the country for No Kings protests against him. An estimated 5 million people participated in protests across 2,100 cities in the U.S. while troops in D.C. marched past sometimes empty stands.

	After delivering a crowd pleaser with one of her latest characters, Ego Nwodim was just as shocked as the FCC likely was by the audience's response.


	The Saturday Night Live star recalled the on-air reaction to her Miss Eggy character “did throw me for a loop” after a call-and-response bit inadvertently caused the crowd to yell “s—” during a Season 50 episode that aired in April.


	“We did not think they were going to say anything because, if we did think so, and if we thought what they were going to say was going to be a curse word, it would have been flagged and it would have been taken out of the sketch,” she explained to Collider. “Even if I would have loved for it to stay, and I would have no control over it. So the second time we did Miss Eggy, we couldn't do ‘because these men ain't what?' again. We might have even tried to, or we talked about it, and standards and practices was like, ‘No, you can't do that, because we know what the audience is going to do.'”

	Nwodim added, “It is wild that it didn't occur to any of us. But I was sincerely stunned. And it was really cool. Honestly, it tickled me that they did that. Then I got to do a thing that I love so much, which is improvised in character. That was an amazing experience to get to do that, and so rewarding and so fun and rewarding and possibly costly.”


	During the bit, Nwodim prompted the crowd with, “'cause these men ain't what?” before receiving the profane response.


	Whether the NBC sketch comedy show was fined by the FCC, Nwodim said, “I don't know. I don't know if we got fined. I don't think so. But anyway, fun time. It was like a little dance with the audience. We were dancing. We were grooving.”

	











	The FCC's own guidelines may have provided SNL with a reprieve, outlining that “indecent and profane content are prohibited on broadcast TV and radio between 6am and 10pm, when there is a reasonable risk that children may be in the audience,” whereas the show begins airing at 11:30pm ET.


	Aided by a slight delay, the West Coast and Mountain SNL broadcasts' cleansing of the “s—” would appear to have handled any FCC backlash for the show, which airs in primetime in those regions.

The Southern California native joins a growing number of music artists speaking out against the immigration raids.


													By
												

	Mitchell Peters



Olivia Rodrigo is adding her voice to the growing outcry over federal immigration raids in Southern California.


	The 22-year-old pop star and actress, who grew up in Temecula, Calif., before moving to Los Angeles in middle school to star in the Disney Channel series Bizaardvark, took to social media on Saturday (June 14) amid widespread protests. The demonstrations erupted in response to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids targeting multiple workplaces across L.A., citing alleged immigration violations.


	“I've lived in LA my whole life and I'm deeply upset about these violent deportations of my neighbors under the current administration,” Rodrigo wrote on her Instagram Story. “LA simply wouldn't exist without immigrants. Treating hardworking community members with such little respect, empathy, and due process is awful. I stand with the beautiful, diverse community of Los Angeles and with immigrants all across America. I stand for our right to freedom of speech and freedom to protest.”

	











	Rodrigo also shared a link to a “Know Your Rights” resource page on the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) website. In a follow-up post on her IG Story, the “Vampire” singer shared a photo from what appeared to be a protest, featuring a handmade sign with a crossed-out crown and the words “in our USA” — a likely nod to the “No Kings Day” demonstrations held on June 14 in response to President Donald Trump's 79th birthday military parade in Washington, D.C.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Rodrigo isn't the only music star raising her voice in response to the recent ICE raids and National Guard presence in Los Angeles. Following President Trump's early June deployment of National Guard troops to the city, a wave of artists — including Tyler, The Creator, Finneas, The Game, Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong, Kehlani, Tom Morello, Reneé Rapp and Rebecca Black — have publicly condemned the administration's actions. Many California officials have denounced the deployment as unconstitutional and inflammatory.


	“F—K ICE,” Tyler wrote on his Instagram Story, sharing a clip from the 2002 film Paid in Full in which the phrase is chanted repeatedly. Finneas also spoke out after claiming he was tear-gassed while attending what he described as a “very peaceful” protest in downtown L.A.  “Tear-gassed almost immediately at the very peaceful protest downtown. They're inciting this,” the Grammy-winning artist and producer posted June 8 on his Instagram Story.

International Box Office Editor/Senior Contributor


SUNDAY UPDATE, Refresh for latest…: Universal's How to Train Your Dragon led the charge at the global and international box office this weekend as Hiccup and Toothless winged in with a $197.8M start worldwide. Of that, $114.1M (which includes previews) is from 81 overseas markets — a smidge lower than where we saw it landing yesterday, which is nothing to snort about, and is above pre-weekend projections.


	The Dean DeBlois-directed live-action take on the beloved animated franchise's first entry, HTTYD has terrific word of mouth, setting it up for a strong run. It notched the 4th best global opening of the year so far, behind A Minecraft Movie, Lilo & Stitch and China's Ne Zha 2. It's also the 7th  biggest for a live-action remake (behind Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Lilo & Stitch, The Jungle Book, Alice in Wonderland and Aladdin).

	Overseas, the Gerard Butler-starrer had the 4th biggest international box office launch of the year among Hollywood pics (behind Lilo, Minecraft and Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning).




			Watch on Deadline		







	Uni kicked off international release with previews across more than 6,600 locations and 13,000 screens (including 339 Imax). Fifty-one of those began previews last weekend, starting with Korea on June 6; a further 10 markets began previews this week, capitalizing on the Whit Monday holiday in several territories. Australia and China did not hold previews and launched on Thursday and Friday this week, respectively.


	Internationally, and excluding China and previews, the launch is in line with Mufasa, just off Aladdin and The Jungle Book, and above HTTYD3, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and The Little Mermaid — in like-for-like markets at today's rates.Latin America, as expected, leaned into the return to Berk, while the UK was very strong and China pleasantly surprised. We'll get to more detail below, but in the meantime, here's an update on the other major titles in the marketplace.


	Disney's Lilo & Stitch, which crossed $800M global during the week, is now at $858.4M through Sunday on its way to becoming the first Hollywood movie of 2025 to cross $1B. The overseas weekend was $31.3M (-54%) as the international cume approaches $500M, currently at $492M through today.

	











	The Top 5 markets to date are: Mexico ($61.8M), UK ($45.1M), France ($35.2M), Brazil ($31.8M) and Germany ($27M).


	Meanwhile, there was another new milestone for Paramount/Skydance's Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning which topped the half-billion mark globally this weekend, now at $506.8M through Sunday. Of the running total, the international box office portion is $340.5M after a $21M fourth weekend (-49%) in 66 markets. 


	The Top 5 are: China ($55.8M), UK ($31.2M), Japan ($27.3M), Korea ($21.6M) and France ($20.8M). 


	In Imax M:I 8 is at $73.3M global box office, the highest ever for the franchise in the format.


	Turning back to HTTYD, here's a rundown of the key performances:


Mexico is the top offshore market with $14M (note that figures for all markets include previews unless otherwise stated). HTTYD was the clear No. 1, and the best opening of the franchise as well as the 3rd biggest start of the year in the market. Excluding previews, it came in above Sonic the Hedgehog 3, The Little Mermaid and Mufasa.


	The UK flew to $11.4M with Friday's official opening day Universal's 4th No. 1 debut of the year. Saturday delivered the best opening Saturday of the franchise. The 3-day launch is tops for the franchise and above Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, Mufasa, Jumanji and Sonic 3.


HTTYD saw terrific uptick in China on Saturday to rep the best Fri-Sat increase of all revenue share films this year, and came in with a No. 1 $11.2M start across the 3-day launch (no previews). The opening surpassed the lifetimes of Sonic 3, Little Mermaid and Wonka and is well above Lilo & Stitch, Mufasa and Moana 2. As noted yesterday (see below), the Maoyan score is 9.5 (as is TPP), which is the highest for all Hollywood movies so far this year. Friday was the biggest non-holiday Friday bow for a studio film in 2025. 


Brazil's $7.8M launch made HTTYD the clear No.1 in the market and is the best start for the franchise. Excluding previews, it came in above Jurassic World Dominion, Mufasa, The Little Mermaid, Aladdin and Top Gun: Maverick.


	Rounding out the Top 5, Korea opened with $7.4M. With a 99% CVG Egg score, HTTYD's opening weekend surpassed the lifetimes of The Little Mermaid, Mufasa and Sonic 3.  It is the biggest opening of the franchise including previews. Excluding previews, it doubled the opening of Lilo & Stitch.


	Rounding out the Top 10 are France ($5.1M), Australia ($4.4M), Spain ($4.3M), Germany ($4M) and Italy ($3.3M).


	Also among select highlights, Thailand ($2.7M) gave HTTYD the biggest opening Friday and Saturday of 2025, with notable recognition for the local dubbing stars, and already surpassing the lifetimes of The Little Mermaid, HTTYD2, Moana 2, Wonka, Mufasa and Sonic 3. In Chile ($1.8M), HTTYD scored the  3rd biggest opening of the year despite the impact of a huge rainstorm at the start of the weekend, which left many areas of Santiago without electricity; it was the clear No.1 and well above comps. In Middle East markets, HTTYD launched with $4.1M across the region. Saudi Arabia's opening was boosted by the strong Gerard Butler fanbase and a talent tour he participated in last month.


	MORE…

	











PREVIOUS, SATURDAY: Universal's How to Train Your Dragon is on track to fly in with a global debut of just over $200M, landing higher than pre-weekend projections. The live-action take on the beloved animated franchise through yesterday had grossed $54.9M from the international box office, including $29.1M in previews. When factoring in domestic estimates, the opening start is looking like $200.4M worldwide through Sunday.


	A global bow at that level would give Hiccup and Toothless bragging rights to the 4th best worldwide opening of the year so far, behind A Minecraft Movie, Lilo & Stitch and China's Ne Zha 2. It would also be the 7th  biggest for a live-action remake (behind Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Lilo & Stitch, The Jungle Book, Alice in Wonderland and Aladdin).


	The Dean DeBlois-directed HTTYD is playing in 81 offshore markets and is on track to gross an estimated $117.7M this session, including previews that began last weekend. That would make the Gerard Butler-starrer the 4th biggest international box office opener of the year among Hollywood movies (behind Lilo, Minecraft and Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning).


	It would also be the No. 6 offshore launch ever for a live-action remake (behind Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Lilo & Stitch, The Jungle Book and Aladdin).


	In terms of individual markets, Mexico kicked into gear with $2.3M on Friday to reach $4.4M including previews. Playing across 3,765 screens, it's the clear No.1 title in the market with a 68% share.


	The UK & Ireland through Friday is at $4.8M, including $3.3M from weekday previews. Friday grossed $1.5M across 2,000 screens, delivering Universal's 4th No. 1 opening of the year in the market.


China, which did not have previews, launched across 35,000 screens on Friday with $2.3M for the day, ranking No.1 at 44% market share. While not a huge number, it was still good enough for the biggest opening day of a live-action adaptation in the past 5 years, and was in line with Inside Out 2, above Mufasa and more than double Wonka and Sonic 3. The Maoyan score is a strong 9.5. 


Brazil on Friday added $689K at No. 1 to bring the running cume to $4.9M including five days of previews. Friday's gross is on par with Mufasa and above The Little Mermaid, Aladdin and Sonic 3. 


Korea through Friday zoomed to $5.3M including previews and with a terrific 99% CVG Egg score. The cume to-date has already surpassed the lifetimes of The Little Mermaid and Mufasa in the market.


HTTYD is also flying in at No. 1 in France ($2.8M through Friday); Germany ($2.4M); Australia ($1.5M), Spain ($2M — Friday was the 4th best of the year and tops for the franchise); Italy ($1.4M); and Thailand ($1.1M — posted the biggest opening Friday of 2025).

	Bryan Bedford, Donald Trump‘s nominee to lead the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), has misled the public, claiming to have a “commercial” pilot license that he does not hold, Politico reported.


	Bedford, who serves as president and CEO of Republic Airways, was listed on the airline's website as holding “commercial, multi-engine and instrument pilot ratings” as recently as Thursday, according to Politico. But after the outlet inquired about Bedford's credentials, the airline removed “commercial” from the webpage on Friday, the publication reported.


	According to Politico, Bedford does not have a commercial pilot's license listed in the FAA registry. But Bedford has claimed since at least 2010 to have that kind of license according to the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine records of Republic Airways' website.


	Bedford does have a private pilot's license, including credentials that he can fly multi-engine planes and fly in bad weather and at nighttime.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The Department of Transportation (DOT) told Politico that Bedford has passed “written and oral exams” to fly commercial aircraft. The department additionally said that Bedford had not “personally nor publicly claimed to be a commercial airline pilot.”

	











	“Bryan never misrepresented his credential; it was an administrative error that was immediately corrected,” DOT said in a statement.


	As Politico noted, The Air Current in an April 2025 article about Bedford also pointed out that the CEO is not a commercial pilot. “Bedford is a pilot himself, although not a commercial pilot, as he has sometimes claimed to be,” The Air Current wrote.

	











	Given recent events, including the Jan. 2025 collision between a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter and American Airlines Flight 5342 over the Potomac River near Washington-Reagan National Airport that killed 67 people, many are looking to the FAA to improve the air traffic control system. Elon Musk, while leading the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, tried to lay off swaths of air traffic controllers but was stopped by the DOT. Trump blamed diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices for the crash.


	Bedford faced questioning last week from the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee as part of his nomination process. Members of the committee grilled him about how his company tried (and failed) to certify pilots who only met half of the federally required flight hours.


	When questioned by Sen. Tammy Duckworth about whether he would keep the number of required hours to 1,500, Bedford would not give a straight answer.

	“It doesn't sound like a yes,” Duckworth said. “It sounds like you're leaving the door open to reduce the number of flight hours below 1,500.”


	“What I'm saying is I don't believe safety is static,” Bedford responded.

Follow all of our Sean Combs trial coverage


	The fifth week of Sean Combs' sex trafficking and racketeering trial revolved around testimony from the hip-hop mogul's recent ex-girlfriend, who acknowledged that while she still loved Combs, she was still processing the “trauma” that came from their three-and-a-half-year relationship. 


	Testifying under the pseudonym “Jane,” the single mother said what began as a whirlwind romance with Combs in January 2021, bolstered by cute nicknames, a lavish trip to Turks and Caicos, and rapid declarations of love, deteriorated into “nightmares” by Combs' arrest last September. 


	Considered Victim-2 in Southern District of New York's case against the 55-year-old, Jane said after a few months of indulging in what she believed was harmless “fantasy talk” about being intimate with another man in front of Combs quickly spun out of control. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“I truly felt that that night just opened like a Pandora's box in our relationship. It just completely set the tone for our relationship moving forward,” Jane testified during her first day on the stand. “It was just a door that I was unable to shut for the remainder of the relationship.” 


	From May 2021 onwards, Jane claimed she felt obligated to “perform” in ecstasy-fueled sex marathons with multiple male escorts as Combs watched. Even when Jane said she began to push back on what she knew as “hotel nights,” saying she was “not a porn star” and that she had “hit a wall,” Combs allegedly continued to push her into the sexual encounters. 

	











	Throughout her six days on the stand — the longest of any witness, including Combs' longtime ex-girlfriend Casandra “Cassie” Ventura — Jane sobbed as she recounted her experience. She grew testy when cross-examined by Combs' defense attorney, Teny Geragos, who suggested Jane's anger was fueled by jealousy over Combs spending time with his other girlfriends, gifting them designer purses, and taking them on luxurious island trips.  

	











	“How much does my body cost?” an upset Jane shot back at Geragos after she asked how much a Bottega Veneta handbag that Combs had given her cost. But by the time Jane left the stand Friday afternoon, she hugged both Geragos and Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey. 


	Amid Jane's testimony, there was heightened excitement around what was happening outside the courtroom, with an appearance from Kanye West, online sleuths spotting a surprise connection to Britney Spears, and ongoing discussion of the removal of a juror, which could impact the jury's verdict.

	Here are the key moments from the trial's second week: 


Will Juror Number Six Be Dismissed? 


	A juror's offhand, friendly comment to court staff sent both parties into a tailspin this week, as they debated whether the juror could continue serving due to uncertainty over his jurisdictional qualifications and inconsistencies with his statements. 


	The 41-year-old male corrections officer had casually mentioned that he recently moved to New Jersey to live with his girlfriend, which would have invalidated his ability to serve on a New York jury. When brought to the court's attention, U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian called the juror in for clarification, where the man said, “[the move] may not be permanent, but that is where I've been staying for the last couple of weeks.” 


	After a long break where both prosecutors and Combs' defense counsel deliberated, the juror was pressed further on his residency.

	Subramanian said the inconsistencies about where he lived and who he lived with could challenge the integrity of the proceeding. “The concern, even if we were to hear from the juror and have some explanation to reconcile the different answers, is that there would be an appearance and a reasonable perception that the process may have been tainted; that there may be a juror on the jury who has an agenda, who wants to be here and is not going to be either able or willing to follow the rules,” Subramanian said. 


	Subramanian said the juror would be removed and told not to return on Monday. But Combs' attorney, Xavier Donaldson, made an impassioned plea to reconsider and allow the juror the chance to clear up the confusion. Donaldson noted this jury is exceptionally diverse and removing juror six, who is Black, would be “in my opinion, going backward.” 

	











	Subramanian said he'd take the request under consideration and let the parties know if anything on his stance had changed.


Kanye West and a Britney Spears Crossover


	After a few days of rampant rumors swirling around a certain rapper making an appearance at the trial, Kanye West strode into the Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse on Friday morning. Dressed in all-white denim, Combs' youngest son, Christian, greeted the rapper and whisked him away to a little-used room that streamed the day's proceedings. 


	The 48-year-old, who has been embroiled in his own controversy for the past few years, watched a few minutes of Combs' former assistant testifying about setting up for “King Nights.” As word quickly spread of his arrival and spectators flocked to the room, West motioned to Christian that he was ready to leave. Within an hour, West had arrived and left the building. 


	West wasn't the only celebrity name mentioned this week. Britney Spears was inadvertently brought into the discourse after it was revealed that Combs' business accountant is Robin Greenhill, an executive at the same management team that worked with Spears during her controversial conservatorship from 2008 to 2021. 


	Spears accused the company, Tri-Star, and Greenhill of working with her father, Jamie, to control and monitor her. Greenhill was accused of “spying” on the singer and allegedly routinely declining Spears' requests for harmless purchases, such as sushi for dinner, despite the superstar having a net worth of around $60 million. 


	Greenhill's name first popped up in Jane's testimony. Following a fight, Combs offered Jane a “love contract,” agreeing to give her a $10,000 monthly allowance, which she used on rent. Jurors were shown an email from Greenhill to Jane's landlord in May 2023, confirming a wire transfer for rent. 


	Combs' former assistant, Jonathan Perez, also mentioned Greenhill in his testimony on Friday, stating that he submitted reimbursement invoices to Tri Star and acknowledged that Greenhill was in charge of releasing funds to Combs and certain members of his team. 


The Messages About $1 Million Jurors Won't See












	As the government prepares to wrap up their case next week, they attempted to insert some eyebrow-raising text messages. One exchange took place among Combs, his longtime friend and security member D-Roc, and Faheem Muhammad, another security guard whom the government described as the CFO of Combs' finances. Combs wanted Muhammad to go into his personal safe and count out $1,137,000 in cash by hand. “This is about the defendant's access to the cash that is used to facilitate his criminal conduct and his co-conspirators' awareness of that and their role in securing that cash,” Assistant United States Attorney Christy Slavik argued.


	Prosecutors also highlighted another conversation between Combs and his former head of security, whom staffers referred to as Uncle Paulie, in October 2015. Paulie sent Combs a dire warning about an apparent violent episode between Combs and his girlfriend Gina while the trio were in Atlanta. (Photos show Combs was in town to host the BET Hip Hop Awards Afterparty.) 


	“If anyone called the police, the police is a hundred percent going to lock you,” the lengthy text message from Paulie said in part. “Even if she begs them not to, it's the law. So once they put the cuffs on you, your life and career is over. Puff, really all over her. Puff, really, your family is going to go down the hill.”


	However, the judge ruled neither exchange could be entered as evidence, saying the $1 million cash conversation was too prejudicial, while the Gina message lacked context and the necessary foundation to be shown to the jury.


“Ain't Nobody Threatening You”: Combs' Voice Notes to Jane 


	Prosecutors played several voice notes that Combs sent to Jane in the aftermath of her backing out of a “freak-off” with several male escorts she'd suggested to Combs during an ecstasy-induced night of “fantasy talk.” After Jane canceled on him, Combs became furious, unleashing a stream of expletives at Jane and accusing her of playing “games.” 


	In the days following the fight, with several messages exchanged between the pair, Combs sent Jane a voice note in August 2023. “Hey, I really don't know what's going on with you, but I just wanted to give you a heads up that I'm really about to disappear on you, you feel me?” Combs casually says. “I'm not going to be playing these games with you. At all. I don't know — you think you silent treating me? And you think I'm a be — nah. You'll have a rude awakening. You'll just have silence. Ain't nobody threatening you.”


	Combs later adds, “Me and you can be mad, we can have a spat, we can have whatever, and then after that — you better get on your job. That's all it is. You got me on my job.”

	











	When asked what Combs meant when he warned that Jane better get on her “job,” she said that she understood Combs was referring to his expectation that she continue participating in marathon sex sessions with male entertainers. 


	On Combs' end, Jane said the mogul's mention of him being on his “job” was a swipe at her for “taking care of me financially.” Earlier that year, Combs agreed to pay Jane a monthly allowance of $10,000 as part of a “love contract.” This voice note, Jane and prosecutors alleged, was part of a larger pattern of Combs constantly bringing up his financial support whenever they fought.


Combs Allegedly Attacks Jane Weeks After Saying He Was “Committed to Being a Better Man”


	On May 17, 2024, Jane was lying in bed with Combs at his Miami mansion when one of his sons knocked on his door, alerting him to a crisis: CNN had just published a surveillance video of him attacking Ventura at the InterContinental Hotel in 2016.  


	Jane said she watched as Combs and his team quickly strategized and crafted an apology statement. “I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now,” Combs said in the since-deleted social media post. “I went, and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I'm so sorry. But I'm committed to be a better man each and every day. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm truly sorry.”


	But just a few weeks later, on June 18, 2024, Jane said she experienced similar violence. During what was supposed to be a romantic dinner at Jane's home in Los Angeles, Combs allegedly flew into a rage after Jane confronted him with her suspicions that he had been on vacation with another woman. 


	After Jane shoved Combs' head into a marble countertop and threw glass items at him, Combs chased her through the house, kicking down four locked doors. He allegedly punched her repeatedly in the head, kicked her as she curled up in a ball, and dragged Jane into the home by her hair before lifting her by the neck in a chokehold. He then allegedly forced Jane to participate in a freak-off that night. 


The Week Ahead 


	After more than two dozen witnesses, prosecutors said they expect to rest their case next week. Their final witnesses are three summary witnesses, a law enforcement official, and Combs' former personal assistant, Brendan Paul.

	Paul was the lone person arrested during the simultaneous raids on Combs' homes in March 2024. As Combs boarded a private plane bound for the Caribbean with his daughters and entourage, police said they found drugs in Pauk's baggage. (Testimony from former assistants said they were expected to travel with an array of illicit substances for Combs.) Paul's case was ultimately dismissed after he completed a drug diversion course. 

	











	The defense said they expect to bring their own witnesses to the stand as soon as Friday. They have not made public who they expect to call.

	Tributes have been pouring in this past week for Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys co-founder and pop music maestro, following his death aged 82. 


	But there have been possibly none so personal as the memories of writer David Leaf, who has recalled how he set out for Los Angeles in 1976 with the firm intention of writing a book about Wilson and his work. 


	As well as writing his book The Beach Boys and the Californian Myth which was published in 1978, Leaf became close friends with his subject after one particular night when he realised just how sweet, but also fragile, Wilson really was.

Leaf tells The Times of London he had encountered Wilson a handful of times during his first months in the city, and recognised him as “a deeply gentle, seemingly defeated soul, before one night cemented their friendship. He writes:




			Watch on Deadline		







	“Melody Maker's West Coast correspondent Harvey Kubernik had rescued Brian as he wandered dangerously in the middle of a busy Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood. Brian admitted to taking too many downers.


	“Harvey and the radio DJ Rodney Bingenheimer then drove Brian to what they were certain was safe harbour: my apartment.


	“It was well after midnight when there was a knock on my door. I opened it, shocked to see the threesome. The LA scenesters left, Brian came in and asked if I had anything to eat. There were two leftover slices of pizza. After a quick reheating in the toaster oven, he wolfed them down. Then he went to sleep on the living room couch. Around 4am he woke up and asked for a ride home.”

	











	Leaf went on to become friends with Wilson, including serving as an usher at his 1995 wedding to Melinda Ledbetter. The writer recounts often going to dinner with Wilson, and hearing him sing along to the car radio. 


	He also recounts a visit by Wilson to perform at HM The Queen's Golden Jubilee in 2002, when the American artist pushed past Ozzy Osbourne to greet Elizabeth II with “Hi, Queen.”


	Tributes have come in from across the music industry this week. Sir Paul McCartney, who always credited Wilson's God Only Knows as his favourite ever song, said: 


	“Brian had that mysterious sense of musical genius that made his songs so achingly special. The notes he heard in his head and passed to us were simple and brilliant at the same time. I loved him, and was privileged to be around his bright shining light for a little while. How we will continue without Brian Wilson, ‘God Only Knows.'”

Fresh off the success of “Materialists,” Chris Evans is letting his fellow Marvel stalwart Sebastian Stan know that he's ready to take to the stage, which Stan apparently has been telling Evans he wants to do for years. Evans, though, doubts that the “Thunderbolts*” actor is serious.

“He can say that all day, but when I really call him on it — I'm like, ‘Let's do it. Which one?' He's like, ‘Well, you know, I'm a little busy.' I'm like, ‘Seb, stop using me in press. Because I'm ready to get on stage with you,'” Evans told Entertainment Weekly. “But, you know, he's a busy guy. He's an Oscar nominee. He's got stuff going on.”

But Evans is insistent that he is “dying to get on stage,” specifically with Stan, who has performed on Broadway in “Picnic” (2013) and “Talk Radio (2007).

“I love Seb. I love working with him,” Evans continued. “Theater's such a massive commitment. You're with the person all day every day. So I would… kill to do it.”

This is not the first time Evans has heaped praise on his “Captain America” co-star. He talked to Vanity Fair earlier this year about Stan's bold career choices, which included a 2024 that saw him in such diverse films as “The Apprentice” and “A Different Man” — both of which led to critical acclaim and a bevy of awards attention.

 










“Sebastian has always been really fearless. You can see that in his choices. He takes big swings. When that Trump movie was kicking around, I remember thinking, ‘I wonder who is going to take this job? It's just got so many strings attached to it.' And I was so unsurprised when I heard it was Sebastian,” Evans said.

And though the star is known for his screen roles, the endurance tests of the MCU may come in handy should he ever grace the Broadway stage.

“They are these big, giant movies. There's a lot of cooks in the kitchen. But the empirical evidence is in: They are not easy to make. If it was easier, there would be a lot more good ones,” Evans said at Emerald City Comic Con in 2024.

Stan is returning to the MCU for “Avengers: Doomsday,” which is currently in production with a release date set for December 18, 2026. Evans' “Materialists” is in theaters now.

	Marketing to specific audiences continues to cost film studios and distributors millions of dollars each year, however, “reliance on focus groups and long-held audience assumptions are outdated concepts and costing the industry millions more in lost revenue opportunities.”


	This is the verdict of audience intelligence platform DiO, who have spent the last two years analysing how different trailers and other screen content lands with particular audiences.


	DiO claims their analysis tools – including facial coding, biometric and cognitive data – confound traditional assumptions about audience appetites, and reveal a surprising shift in how viewers engage emotionally with what they see on screen.

	Their research was conducted across 37,000 consumers of content and key findings include:

	DiO CEO and founder Ade Shannon said: “This data points towards a shifting perception of masculinity and an evolving appetite for richer, more grounded storytelling.”


	Indie production studio True Brit recently used the data amassed by DiO to plan the marketing campaign around their title Marching Powder, specifically to pinpoint aspects of the film that would appeal to potential viewers outside its core 35+ male audience.


	Released in March, Marching Powder stars popular “hardman” British actor Danny Dyer as Jack, a man arrested for fighting and drug possession during a football hooligan brawl, who is ordered by court to go to couples' therapy.


	True Brit shares that tweaking their campaign based on the data boosted their strong box office opening of £3.1m against a £1.6m production budget, specifically increasing its female audience to 45% without isolating their core audience.


	Commenting on the strategy, Chris Besseling, the studio's head of theatrical distribution, Marketing and Publicity, said: “Using the detailed analytics provided by DiO's report, we were able to identify the specific moments, characters, lines and gags from the trailer that resonated most strongly with the two distinctly different audiences that we were targeting. This enabled us to build a tailored, two-pronged campaign with bespoke creative assets that best served the different potential audience groups.”

Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard are “Severance” fans just like everybody else. They, however, have one advantage: Adam Scott‘s cell phone number. In Bell's Actors on Actors interview with Scott, the “Nobody Wants This” star made public exactly what she and her “Parenthood” husband leave in the text chain.

“The endings to every episode of ‘Severance' are so biologically frustrating that I don't know how you guys expect anyone to sleep after an episode with that level of a cliffhanger,” Bell started. “So what Dax and I tend to do is, when we see someone whose work we love or whose work frustrates us — as in your case — we leave you a nice, long, detailed, unedited voice memo. And you got a lot of those.”

Scott professed to have saved every one of the messages, calling them both “deeply flattering” and “deeply insulting.” While deep in production on the second season, one message from Bell and Shepard said, “Hey, just curious, are you guys shooting this one minute per week? Why is it taking so fucking long?” Scott teased, “Just because you guys left that message, it's now going to take seven years for the next season.”

 










Bell's favorite memo came when Shepard screamed out the message, “Hey, Adam. Kristen just fell out of a two-story window. I bet you'd like to know how she's doing. I'll tell you next week!”

Bell and Shepard are typical of the committed “Severance” fanbase, as Scott related to The Los Angeles Times in March.

“I was a huge ‘Lost' fan and huge ‘Twilight Zone' person, so I totally get it,” he said. “I don't really dive into all the theories and stuff on this, but I have seen some on Instagram, which is usually video of a podcast where they're really diving into one theory or the other. Also, all of the artwork that people are making, it's overwhelming and incredible. Whenever I see one on Instagram, I save every single one.”

Bell, Shepard, and the rest of the “Severance” heads will have to wait a while for the third season. While its production has been confirmed by executive producer Ben Stiller and Apple TV+, a date has yet to be announced.

Nowadays, it seems almost any movie released to positive reviews gets some buzz as an “instant classic.” But a lot of classics aren't dubbed as such upon release — quite the opposite, actually. Sometimes, the movies that go on to endure the longest and find the most devoted of followings are the ones completely dismissed upon their premiere.

Hindsight is a fickle, fickle beast, and nowhere is it more powerful than in the world of film criticism, where the instant reactions of a movie don't always measure up to what the movie's legacy will be years and decades down the line. There are plenty of well-reviewed, commercially successful, and even Oscar-winning films that have, from the passage of time, lost their luster in some way or another — whether it's just because of taste changing (see: “Out of Africa”) or some broader backlash and controversy (see: “American Beauty.”)

Then, there are times where the exact opposite has happened. If a film is ahead of its time, sometimes it's difficult for those looking at it then to see its virtues. Across film history there have been movies that have bombed at the box office, gone ignored by the Oscars, and — most dispiriting of all — gotten savaged by film critics, that have since received major reappraisals in their legacies. Sometimes, those reevaluations are led by filmmakers, others by future critics digging up an underrated gem. Regardless, it's a phenomenon that happens often enough to remind one that a film's reputation isn't set in stone, but a living thing that can undergo a metamorphosis, degrading or growing with the years.

Oftentimes, these films are on the stranger or less conventional side, with singular aesthetics or styles that audiences can't really appreciate because they're so new — pioneering works like “The Night of the Hunter” and “Metropolis” fit into this category. Others are panned by critics who find their actual content objectionable; it's no surprise a decent amount of these films are in the horror genre, which often stirs controversy and criticism for its violence, sex, and explicit content. Whatever the reason, these 10 films got, at best, mixed reactions from professional critics in their day — but today? They've secured reputations as some of the most acclaimed movies ever. Read on for 10 great films that were panned by critics upon release.

Today, Fritz Lang's “Metropolis” is regarded as one of the greatest achievements of the silent film period, and a pioneering science fiction work with themes of class warfare and human nature that would influence many works to come. But, while German expressionist work received some positive reviews, reception was mixed at best upon release. Variety wrote that “so much really artistic work was wasted on this manufactured story” in their dispatch at the time. Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times called it a “Technical marvel with feet of clay.” The most damning pan came from English science fiction writer H.G. Wells, who accused the film of “foolishness, cliché, platitude, and muddlement about mechanical progress and progress in general,” and compared it unfavorably to other science fiction works, most notably Mary Shelley's original “Frankenstein” novel. 

Based on a novel of the same name, Charles Laughton's “The Night of the Hunter” is a stark black and white fairy tale starring Robert Mitchum in his most iconic role as a serial killer who poses as a preacher to manipulate and torment a widowed woman and her two children. At the time of its release in 1955, reviews had some nice things to say, but largely considered the film a failure. Bosley Crowther of the New York Times called the movie a “weird and intriguing endeavor,” but criticized Laughton's direction and the allegorical elements of the film. Gene Arneel of Variety said the film was “bewitching at times,” but “loses sustained drive via too many offbeat touches that have a misty effect.”

Laughton took the failure of the film hard, and never made a movie again. However, by the '70s — as a result of TV screenings, art house showings, and reappraisals from critics like Roger Ebert — it had been reevaluated as a masterpiece, and one of the greatest thrillers ever made. 

Alfred Hitchcock was a director who enjoyed plenty of critical acclaim during his career as a filmmaker. But upon its release, “Vertigo” — his 1958 film starring James Stewart as a private detective with acrophobia who becomes obsessed with the woman (Kim Novak) he's assigned to trail — wasn't one of them. The film received some positive reviews, but most were tepid at best. Variety called the movie “only a psychological murder mystery” and criticized its length and pacing. Bosley Crowther of the New York Times gave the movie some qualified praise, but called the twist “devilishly far-fetched,” while John McCarten of The New Yorker was extremely critical, writing that Hitchcock had “never before indulged in such farfetched nonsense.” In the years following its initial release, “Vertigo” quickly rose in reputation, and now it's commonly considered Hitchcock's masterwork, and even topped the Sight & Sound Greatest Films of All Time poll. 

Arthur Penn's “Bonnie and Clyde,” a romantic account of the notorious 1930s outlaws, was very controversial at its time for its graphic violence and perceived glorification of its subjects, and the reviews of the day were appropriately divided. Roger Ebert was highly positive, giving the film one of its major raves. Other critics were less kind. Dave Kaufman of Variety criticized Penn's direction as uneven, while Joe Morgenstern of Newsweek called the film a “squalid shoot-'em-up,” but later reevaluated it upon a second watch. The most notorious pan, however, came from Bosley Crowther of The New York Times, who wrote in his review that the film was “a cheap piece of bald-faced slapstick comedy that treats the hideous depredations of that sleazy, moronic pair as though they were as full of fun and frolic as the jazz-age cutups in ‘Thoroughly Modern Millie.'” Even as the film became a financial success and eventually attracted more positive criticism, Crowther remained vehemently opposed to it, and was replaced as the Times' chief critic a year later at least partially because of the controversy. The film would ultimately receive 10 Oscar nominations, and is nowadays credited with ushering in the New Hollywood revolution of the late '60s and '70s. 

Early reviews of “The Rocky Horror Picture Show,” a film version of Richard O'Brien and Jim Sharman's cult classic British musical, were largely negative. Reviewers from Variety called it “labored,” the San Francisco Chronicle said it lacked “charm and dramatic impact,” while Newsweek wrote that it was “tasteless, plotless, and pointless.” The movie also flopped upon its initial release, but slowly picked up an audience through midnight movie screenings. That audience only grew through the years, and the film is now a beloved queer cult film, one that continues to be screened year round to this day. 

A remake of the 1953 French film “The Wages of Fear,” William Friedkin's “Sorcerer” stars Roy Scheider, Bruno Cremer, Francisco Rabal, and Amidou as four men living in Central America who get hired to transport two trucks loaded with dynamite 200 miles to an oil well. Made under grueling conditions that escalated its budget, the film was a massive box office bomb upon release, and reviews weren't much better. Although a few critics like Roger Ebert and Vincent Canby gave the movie decent notices, many other reviewers unfavorably compared it to “The Wages of Fear” and criticized Friedkin for perceived poor craftsmanship. In a review for The Village Voice, Andrew Sarris went as far as to call it “a visual and aural textbook on everything that is wrong with current movies.” In the years since, however, the film has largely been reevaluated, and is regularly seen as one of Friedkin's best projects and one of the best movies of the '70s. 

At the time of its release, Stanley Kubrick's “The Shining” was largely received very negatively by both audiences (earning a “C+” Cinemascore) and critics. Many reviewers criticized the film's slow pacing, its deviations from the original Stephen King novel it was based upon, and its perceived lack of emotional impact. Janet Maslin of the New York Times said “even the film's most startling horrific images seem overbearing and perhaps even irrelevant,” while Pauline Kael wrote “Again and again, the movie leads us to expect something – almost promises it – and then disappoints us.” Both Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert were negative in their reviews of the film, with Siskel calling it a “a crashing disappointment” that “contains effectively no thrills” while Ebert wrote in his review that it was impossible to connect with the film's characters. At the first Golden Raspberry Awards, Kubrick was nominated for Worst Director. In the long run, though, “The Shining” was criticially appraised as one of the best horror films ever — and, in contrast to what critics said at the time, one of the absolute scariest. 

Another horror film that critics didn't know what to make of upon its release, “Possession” — Andrzej Żuławski's oblique film about the deteriorating marriage between a spy (Sam Neill) and his unraveling wife (Isabelle Adjani) — was received with lukewarm response upon its U.S. release, in part due to edits made from the original cut. Harry Haun of the New York Daily News wrote that the film was “outlandishly unhinged” and a “mess,” while Leonard Maltin called it a “confusing drama of murder, horror, intrigue.” In his review, New York Times critic Vincent Canby wrote that “New York audiences might be reduced to helpless laughter” by the film. Thanks to the original cut coming to America, and some critical appraisal, the fiendish marital drama is now largely regarded today as one of the best horror movies ever made. 

A commercial failure upon release, John Carpenter's “The Thing” was also widely negatively received by critics, with many responding poorly to the film's cynical, anti-authoritarian themes. In a brutal pan, Vincent Canby referred to the film as a “foolish, depressing, overproduced movie that mixes horror with science fiction to make something that is fun as neither one thing or the other,” calling it a “moron movie” and “instant junk.” Other critics such as Linda Gross wrote that the film was “bereft, despairing, and nihilistic,” claiming that the tone prevented the deaths of the characters from having any impact. The visual effects were largely praised, but many critics also had a problem with their gore and excess. Home video helped the movie pick up a cult audience, and by the '90s, the film had been reevaluated as a classic.  

Premiering a year after the original TV run of “Twin Peaks” endedthe story of Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) on a massive cliffhanger, “Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me” was greeted with revulsion from both fans and critics, at least partially because it was instead a prequel about the final days of haunted prom queen Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee). At its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, Lynch recalled the film getting booed by audiences, while critics referred to the film as “shockingly bad” (Roger Ebert) and “pathologically unpleasant” (Janet Maslin). Reviews upon its American release were just as negative: Vincent Canby wrote “It's not the worst movie ever made; it just seems to be” while Owen Gleiberman called it “a true folly” in which “almost nothing adds up.”

Through the '90s and 2000s, as Lynch repaired his reputation through masterpieces like “Mulholland Drive” and “Twin Peaks” was evaluated as a canonical, defining TV show, more defenders of “Fire Walk With Me” have emerged, with critics praising Lee's performance as Laura Palmer and the film's unvarnished depiction of abuse. By 2017, when the sequel series to “Twin Peaks” “The Return” premiered to massive critical acclaim, the film's reputation had been restored completely, and it's now viewed as a classic.

	If there's one thing the K's know how to do, it's throw a party — or, rather, put on a wild rock show. For the Earlestown, England, band, it's essentially the same thing. Back in 2017, the K's packed out a tiny bar in Manchester for their first-ever headlining set. People were so crammed into the small space, they climbed one another's shoulders to head-bang along, feeding off the band's infectious mix of speedy riffs and punk-inspired attitude. At one point, crowd-surfers pulled pipes down from the ceiling.


	At the time, the K's had yet to release their first single, “Sarajevo,” but were already building a vivacious audience of fans one pub party performance at a time. 


	“Our favorite thing by a million miles will always be playing live shows and having that connection with an audience,” lead singer Jamie Boyle, 29, says over Zoom. He's backstage before the K's next show in Halifax at Piece Hall, with lead guitarist Ryan Breslin, 30, seated next to him.

	











	“All the energy at our shows is really a testament to years of doing smaller stages in the pubs and the clubs. That's definitely where we learned how to bounce off each other onstage,” Breslin says. 


	Earlier this month, the K's brought their supercharged live set to Rolling Stone's “Future of Music U.K.” showcase at Hoxton Hall for the inaugural South by Southwest London festival. “It was a welcome change to go back to a nice, intimate venue,” Boyle says, referring to the 200-capacity room. Just a month before, the K's played a sold-out show to 3,000 concertgoers at London's Roundhouse. But they always prefer the smaller spaces. “You get a more personable feel with the crowd,” Boyle says. 

	











	For Boyle and the rest of the band, rounded out by bassist Dexter Baker and drummer Nathan Peers, performing live is their favorite part of making music “That's the way that we sort of honed our craft, playing live, and that feeds into the songs,” Breslin says.

	The band's guitar-heavy music, inspired by U.K. New Wave group the Jam, is what keeps those live shows enthralling. From the moment they released the chanty “Sarajevo,” fans responded. The track racked up 100,000 streams within its first two weeks. “We were like, what on earth is going on? Because we'd never done anything before,” recalls Boyle. 


	The band followed “Sarajevo” with a string of catchy singles, hoping to get the attention of record labels. But as they were talking to some in 2020, the pandemic hit and the offers dried up. “It was shit at the time but definitely did us a favor in the long run because we had that extra time to find our craft,” Boyle says. “And find out what we wanted to sound like.”


	After refining their energetic rock and infusing it with acoustic pop elements, the K's finally landed a record deal with indie U.K. label the Lab in 2023. Their first album, I Wonder If the World Knows, was released last April and made 2024 a momentous year for the band. The LP debuted at Number Three on the U.K. albums chart, going up against Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter and the Libertine's All Quiet on the Eastern Esplanade. That same month, the band was named the “breakout act of the year” at the inaugural Northern Music Awards. 


	Now, just over a year after I Wonder If the World Knows, the K's are gearing up for their second album, Pretty on the Internet, out June 27 via Lab Records. Produced by Jim Lowe, the project came together after Boyle brought 16 new songs to the group just months after the release of their debut LP. As the main songwriter of the group, Boyle is constantly jotting down notes whenever an idea strikes him. “It's almost been a bit of a coping mechanism for me,” he says of writing in general, before adding with a laugh: “That's why there's such a high output, because I'm constantly having a meltdown every other day.”

	It's Boyle's personal lyrics that distinguish Pretty on the Internet. “The records are getting more mature and not just being about getting drunk and getting battered on night out,” he says. With the album's first singles, Boyle addressed raw topics, from his mental health struggles on “Breakdown in My Bedroom” to his thoughts on mortality with “Graveyards.”

	











	Still, the K's have yet to release their favorite tracks from the album. For Peers, that's the evocative “Perfect Heart,” which almost didn't make the record (he threatened to leave the band if it didn't). It's one of Breslin's favorite's too. “We all nearly had a tear in our eyes when we listened to it,” he says.


	Meanwhile, Boyle digs “33 Heads” for its focus on vocal layering, a new facet of the band's production style. “I'm a big Beach Boys fan, with all the harmonies,” he says. “It's got one guitar and four harmony vocals all going at once, and then my lead vocal over the top.”


	This year, the K's hope to bring their new release stateside. Back in March, they made their U.S. debut at SXSW in Austin. “It was a bit surreal to be that far away from home and playing new songs that everyone knows over there… it was a ‘pinch me' moment,” Breslin says. 


	In between bar-hopping and checking out new bands, the K's signed to United Talent Agency to help them with booking in America. “We've got a full tour plan, so it's like we've just dipped our toe in at the minute and we're really excited to properly get into it,” Boyle says. The city they can't wait the most to play? “New York, definitely,” he says.

	While they're excited to plan their first U.S. tour, the K's don't like to look too far ahead. “We try not to think about set goals,” Boyle says. “It often leaves you a bit restricted.” After all, they've made it this far by embracing spontaneity. “It is so mental to sit here and think this is what we do for work,” he adds. “We get to just go around the world with our mates playing music.”


	The K's might be too busy soaking up their currently unbelievable reality to think about where they might be in five years, but they do reflect on every misstep that has brought them to this moment. When asked what he would tell his younger self, Boyle hesitates, lost in thought before he shakes his head. “I'd say make all the same mistakes and do exactly how we've done it,” he says with a smile. “We've definitely gone the scenic route.”

	Distributor Mubi has responded to backlash over its recent source of investment – $100million worth from Sequoia Capital. 


	It was reported by Puck last month that Mubi had secured the sum from Sequia, a Silicon Valley-based company with investments in a wide range of companies, ranging from Apple to ByteDance and also with close ties to defence-tech startup Kela, founded in 2024 by a group of Israeli intelligence veterans in response to the Hamas attacks of October 7 2023.. The website reports that Kela is currently developing a battlefield operating system enabling military units to integrate AI and commercial tech.

	This comes against a polarised discussion in cultural and creative circles pertaining to the Israel-Gaza conflict and some calls online for Mubi to be boycotted. Some customers online say they have cancelled their subscriptions and Film Workers for Palestine said it was “horrified” by Mubi's decision. “This is unacceptable, and we demand that Mubi return the investment,” it wrote in a much-shared Instagram post.




			Watch on Deadline		







Now Mubi have responded, sharing this statement on their Instagram account Saturday:


	“Since our founding, MUBI has raised money from a number of sources to help us grow. Our decision to work with outside investors has always served one purpose: to accelerate our mission of delivering bold and visionary films to global audiences. This was the rationale behind our recent partnership with the venture firm Sequoia Capital.“Sequoia has a 50-plus year history of partnering with founders to help turn their ideas into world-changing businesses. Sequoia's investments span a range of founders, industries, and geographies. We chose to work with Sequoia because the firm, and our Sequoia Partner Andrew Reed, support MUBI's mission and want to help us scale and bring great cinema to even more people around the world.“Over the last several days, some members of our community have commented on the decision to work with Sequoia given their investment in Israeli companies and the personal opinions expressed by one of their partners. The beliefs of individual investors do not reflect the views of MUBI.“We take the feedback from our community very seriously, and are steadfast in remaining an independent founder-led company.”


	Mubi previously went on a buying spree at Cannes Film Festival, including spending $24 million on Die My Love, starring Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson. Its biggest cinematic success so far is The Substance, which made approximately $80million at the box office and brought Demi Moore an Oscar nomination earlier this year.

James Bond may live to see another chapter in his new Amazon home, but British director Danny Boyle has ruled himself out of joining him there.


	The Oscar winner (for Slumdog Millionaire) was the director of the 25th Bond movie, until he dropped out in 2018 over creative differences with the producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson. He was replaced by Cary Joji Fukunaga, and the film No Time to Die was released in 2021.


	Asked if he would consider picking up the baton again with the sale of the franchise to Amazon, Boyle told Business Insider: “That ship has sailed.”

	He added that the one regret he had about leaving the project in 2018 was that “the script was really good. John Hodge (Boyle's longtime collaborator) is a wonderful writer.”




			Watch on Deadline		







Business Insider added that Boyle had previously revealed his plot would revolve around a Russian villain, and would have included the death of Bond – as later eventuated in No Time to Die – as actor Daniel Craig had negotiated that finale as part of his contract.


	James Bond has been one of the big screen's great icons since his first outing in 1962's Dr No under the aegis of producer Albert “Cubby” Broccoli. His daughter Barbara and stepson Wilson inherited the project and have steered the brand into a billion-dollar franchise over the last three decades.


	Prior to the headline-grabbing complete buy-out by Amazon, Broccoli said she would not be rushed on finding a replacement for her leading man.

	











In March, the Daily Mail newspaper quoted an production insider explaining:


	“There have been so many erroneous rumours about the future of Bond. Amazon is committed to keeping the spirit of Bond alive and that means he has to be British or from the Commonwealth – and he has to be male.”

Nearly three weeks after Jamal Roberts won season 23 of “American Idol,” the R&B singer continues to be asked by media and fans about widespread speculation that judge Carrie Underwood wasn't thrilled about his rise to the top. 

Roberts has repeatedly taken the high road, giving Underwood the benefit of the doubt and insisting that the country star seemed supportive while he was on the show. But at the BET Awards 45th anniversary dinner on June 11, 2025, 27-year-old Roberts admitted to online journalist Nate Vinson that he knows he likely wasn't her favorite — and that he's proud of her for staying true to her “roots.”

A post shared by Carrie Underwood (@carrieunderwood)

In a clip Vinson tweeted of his interview with Roberts, he could be heard telling the “American Idol” winner, “There is a very strong narrative online about one of the judges of the show, Miss Carrie Underwood.” 

Roberts laughed, clearly unsurprised by getting another question about the supposed controversy, as Vinson continued, “People that watched the show felt like, you know, she really wasn't supportive of you like other judges, other people were of you. Have you seen any of that backlash and what is your response to that?”

“My response is Carrie is a country singer,” Roberts replied. “She likes country music. I mean, I don't think she likes every genre, for real. She had her picks, and she had to choose who she really liked, and she stuck with it. So, we applaud her for sticking to her roots and sticking to who she liked. But, you know, I feel like the better person won.”

Roberts beat out 19-year-old country crooner John Foster and 27-year-old contemporary Christian artist Breanna Nix for the top spot. 

Roberts' clip with Vinson drew lots of reactions on X. Some defended Underwood, others said she should have been more supportive, and a few neutral observers encouraged everyone to calm down and drop the drama. 

One tweeted, “Leave dude be and let him glow. Leave her be and let people actually express their opinions without (expletive) like this. Dude is super talented, but not my genre. Whatever. Congrats bro 💯💪👏”

The controversy stems from some of Roberts' supporters taking issue with Underwood's comments and expressions during the singer's season 23 performances. During his audition, for example, she said he needed more “swagger” to match his big voice. Later, after one of his top five performances, she said, “I feel like you missed such an opportunity to move around and entertain,” adding that it was time to “pull out all the stops.”

On May 30, a week after Roberts' victory, “The Morning Hustle” co-host Lore'l told Roberts that some viewers thought Underwood “kind of side-eyed you” after host Ryan Seacrest announced him as the winner. 

Roberts diplomatically replied, “Watching all the past performances, I see that she was clapping and getting on board, so I really don't know.”

“I didn't like her energy toward you,” Lore'l admitted, “and I think that's why I'm shading her in this interview here … is because I did not like the swagless comment, or saying that you needed swag, I did not like how she looked at you sometimes in some performances. I really wanted to come through the screen.”

Right after the finale ended, Underwood told Extra, “I do like the way it was set up, there was no way America could've gotten it wrong. We had three incredible finalists occupying three different lanes, they all had their own vibes, their own styles, their own vocal ranges and styles and techniques, and I feel like it was a great finale.” 

“But Jamal just has a gift from God,” she continued. “His voice is insane. Every time he opens his mouth, it's flawless … I got to tell him afterwards, ‘Now, go do great things!' And I feel like he certainly can.”

After she returned home to her farm near Nashville, Underwood named a baby sheep after Roberts that was born on the same day of the finale. She has since called the lamb “Baby J” in subsequent Instagram Stories.

The husband of a “Real Housewives” executive assistant, Lauren Miller, has courageously spoken out on social media to give an update after his wife died immediately following the birth of the couple's second child.

Miller's husband Kevin left his statements in the comment section of an Instagram post made by Miller's employer, Shed Media, announcing her passing. In his message, the bereaved father said, “Lauren is truly the love of my life and I will miss her every moment of everyday.” He added, “She lives on through her children and we have peace knowing she is in heaven with God looking down on us and keeping us safe and filled with love.”

The announcement to which Miller's husband was replying stated that Lauren Miller “tragically passed away just moments after giving birth to her son, Jackson.” The post also called Miller “a valued member of the Shed team for nearly nine years” and commended her for her contributions to shows such as “The Real Housewives of New York,” “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City,” and “From Paris With Love.” The third slide in the post shows a photo of the family during Miller's pregnancy with Jackson.

Along with her husband and newborn son, the mother leaves behind a three-year-old daughter.

Although it was confirmed by Shed Media that Miller died moments after delivering her child, the exact complications that lead to the tragedy have not been publicly revealed.

A GoFundMe titled “Support for Lauren's Beloved Family,” which was created on behalf of her husband, gave a few more details on the situation, stating, “We are devastated for her beloved husband, Kevin, who must now unexpectedly take on the sole role of parenting their two children … Emma (3) and newborn Jackson, who is still in the NICU. That the day Lauren was so eagerly awaiting should end in tragedy is truly unfathomable.”

An update later revealed baby Jackson was released from the NICU on Thursday, June 12. The update thanked contributors for their support, saying, “As we cope with our own grief, it has been so incredibly touching to see how this fundraiser has spread.”

Lauren Miller is not the only notable media figure to recently die of complications from delivering a baby. In April 2024, NBC reported Instagram star and nursing influencer Hailey Okula, whose handle was @rnnewgrads, had died following the birth of her first child, a son named Crew. The influencer had almost half a million Instagram followers.

Okula's cause of death was an extremely rare delivery complication called “AFE,” which stands for amniotic fluid embolism. The condition occurs when them mother is allergic to her own amniotic fluid, per WebMD.

A few weeks after the loss, Okula's husband wrote in a tribute on Easter 2025, “I wish you were here to create the family memories we dreamed about together. I miss you more than words can capture and can't wait for the day I get to see you again. Thank you for being my everything. You always have been and always will be my beautiful angel.”

Pussy Riot showed solidarity on “No Kings” Day, participating in the march in Los Angeles on Saturday. They joined the demonstration while displaying a red banner that read, “It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Russia.”


	The march in downtown Los Angeles drew about 20,000 people, and was one of 2,000 locations that held “No Kings” Day protests against the president, who has deployed the National Guard and the Marines to L.A. over protests opposing his administration's aggressive raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The protests were held on the same day Trump threw an expensive military parade on his 79th birthday in Washington, D.C.


	Pussy Riot co-founder Nadya Tolokonnikova's “Police State” installation at the Geffen Contemporary at MOCA was postponed Sunday, when the National Guard was deployed. “Due to evolving conditions in downtown Los Angeles and the proximity of The Geffen Contemporary at MOCA to ongoing demonstrations and military activity near the Los Angeles Federal Detention Facility, the museum has made the decision to adjust its operating hours and event schedule out of concern for the safety of staff and visitors,” MOCA said on its website. The 10-day exhibit was originally set to conclude tomorrow, with a panel and performance of Siberia. The rescheduled dates have not yet been released.

	In a statement regarding Pussy Riot's participation in the “No Kings” march, Tolokonnikova reflected on Russia and the current state of the world in relation to her exhibit. “It's not quite a penal colony here, but a halfway house,” she said. “Once again, when I write a statement or a song, a demon on my left shoulder is whispering: ‘How much is too much? Will this get you jailed or not quite yet??' The answer is – idfk. When the law is being used not to protect freedoms, put to punish – selectively and voluntarily – those who speak out, no lawyer can tell you what's safe, and what's not. As my Russian lawyer used to say, “Nadya, stop asking me what's safe – if you want to be safe, leave Russia.”

	Tolokonnikova said that she refused to leave her home country, until she realized “If I stayed, I'd spend the rest of my life behind bars.” She added that Russian President Vladimir Putin promised “safety and stability” and instead is “waging the bloodiest war in modern Europe.”


	“It's beginning to feel a lot like Russia…. Everywhere you go,” she continued.

	“My job as an artist is to interpret those feelings. I felt that tingle for a bit now, that is why I did the POLICE STATE exhibit,” she said. “The walls are closing, the camera systems are getting AI upgrades, you have to censor what you say or unidentified masked men will show up at your home, at your work, at your church. One day, leaving the museum, I stepped into an actual police state – rows of police assaulting peaceful protesters.”


	“I guess you could say it's my first artistic collaboration with the United States Military,” she concluded. “Now we are on the street protesting alongside people who believe immigrants make America great.”

"I can feel the weight of abandoning these people who have written over the years, ‘You saved my life,' ‘I got sober because of you.' And there's part of me that's like, ‘Are they going to be ok?'" Maron said. 


							By 

	Caitlin Huston


Business Writer


Marc Maron is contemplating what life will be like post-podcast as he approaches the end of the WTF with Marc Maron Podcast.


	Speaking after the Tribeca Film Festival screening Saturday of Are We Good?, a documentary about Maron grappling with the loss of his partner Lynn Shelton and trying to channel his grief into his work, Maron was asked about giving so much of himself to the public via his long-running podcast, his comedy specials and even on his Instagram. Maron had announced earlier this month that the podcast would be ending this fall after 16 years.

					Marc Maron's 'WTF' Podcast Ending in the Fall: "We're Burnt Out"		
			









	“I do put a lot of it out there. And I can handle it, and I can be gracious about it. And I don't know what it's going to be like not to do that twice a week,” Maron said in reference to the podcast. “And I don't know what part of it is my own neediness or my own need to connect. But I can feel the weight of abandoning these people who have written over the years, ‘You saved my life,' ‘I got sober because of you,' ‘I didn't kill myself.' And there's part of me that's like ‘Are they going to be ok? Should I reach out to them personally?'”


	Tony and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Tracy Letts, a friend of Maron's, led the talkback, which also included documentary director Steven Feinartz.


	“It's a bit much, Tracy, is what I'm saying, and I think I deserve to try to figure out how to live my life not with privacy, but without that responsibility a little bit,” Maron added. 


WTF has been one of the most streamed podcasts since it launched on Sept. 1, 2009, and has included interviews between Maron and famous figures such as Robin Williams, Keith Richards, Nicole Kidman and former President Barack Obama. The episodes, conducted out of Maron's garage, also offer a revealing look at Maron's own life, with the host often talking about his personal life, pet peeves and grudges and relationships with the guests on the show. 

	











	He announced the end of the show June 2, saying that he and his producing partner Brendan McDonald were “burnt out” after doing two shows every week for 16 years. 


	In the talkback, Maron added that he had not started the podcast with the goal of making money or creating content, but rather was looking to create a connection with each guest and have “an empathic conversation with somebody about who they are.” He added that it was also his “whole fucking social life.”  


	“It meant the world to me and really evolved my sense of self and my sense of being a person,” he said. 


	“All of this stuff that I do has fueled whatever my particular creativity is. And I'm sure I'm not going to disappear after the podcast,” Maron continued. “But the goal will now be to figure out where to channel that creativity.”


	In the near term that will include another HBO comedy special set to release in August, and the new Apple show Stick, alongside Owen Wilson.

It is possible to have too much of a good thing.

In the case of “Star Trek: Strange New Worlds” Season 3, reviewing the frothy, effortlessly watchable first five episodes brings this reviewer to that inescapable conclusion. This is the show that brought the fun back to “Star Trek,” that brought back the astronomical alchemy of Gene Roddenberry's “Original Series” and Rick Berman's '90s “Trek” series in a way most viewers thought they'd never see again. You could hold up a mirror to our society and have a lighthearted, pop-art-colored romp; you could inspire deep emotion alongside genuine thrills. 

 










Of that equation, though, the deep emotion is missing from Season 3 of “Strange New Worlds,” as is the mirror — even despite a character literally saying in one episode that sci-fi can make us look more closely at our own world.

All that's left is the fun. Hey, who are we to complain when it's a show this fun? But “Star Trek” always has had the capacity to be more, and so has this show: This very series has given us incredibly complex episodes discussing our own social moment (going so far as to say that 23rd century historians labeled the U.S. in the 2020s as in a “Second Civil War”), a riveting courtroom drama about personal freedom, and, in “Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow” one of the most soulful of all “Trek” episodes, one that truly turns Kirk into a romantic hero for the ages. 

 










Instead, in the first half of Season 3, “Strange New Worlds” opts to keep it surface-level.

The season picks up instantly after the last frames of the Season 2 cliffhanger, with a number of the Enterprise crew captured by the Gorn and the ship itself being swarmed by Gorn attack craft. The plot unfolds in an undeniably clever way — Season 3 continues to be smart, but is never quite thought-provoking — with a resolution to this story that feels very “Trek” and a lot of LED-wall CGI mush that feels sludgy and like any other TV production these days. A number of storylines are set up from these events related to ongoing physical and psychological trauma on account of the Gorn, for which your interest-level may vary.

The cast is uniformly stellar, as always. Anson Mount brings a texture and integrity to his Capt. Pike that puts him among the best “Star Trek” series leads ever. Previous “Trek” series did so much to establish that their leaders have lives beyond the captain's chair, have thoughts beyond their captain's log — Picard's love of classical music and Dixon Hill detective stories, Sisko's role as a father and his interest in his heritage and in archaeology, Archer's burning desire to watch “Rosemary's Baby” after literally saving Earth, Janeway's depression and inward turn during the “Night” episode of “Voyager” — and of all the “Trek” series since the franchise relaunched as a streaming property in 2017, Mount's Pike is the only one that really fits in their ranks. He brings so much more to the role than just the delivery of dialogue, finding gestures and expressive nuances that convey far beyond what could ever be on the page alone. His romantic relationship with Capt. Batel (Melanie Scrofano) is a particularly great way to further explore dimensions of both characters.

 










Babs Olusanmokun continues to bring dimension and depth, even coiled menace, as Dr. M'Benga, whose remarkable Season 2 episode that resulted in him pretty obviously flat-out murdering a Klingon war criminal is revisited quickly in Season 3. Jess Bush's Nurse Chapel is never less than riveting, somehow funny and earnest in the most perfect “Trek” way. Christina Chong's La'an is one of the great humor-by-way-of-repression characters the franchise has ever given us. 

And under Ethan Peck's extraordinary steering of the character, Spock has become all but a Jane Austen hero, someone whose rigid control of their emotions and adherence to the strictest code of conduct corrals a barely-contained sensuality. He's the “Pride and Prejudice” hand-flex as a full-fledged character. (One can't even imagine Leonard Nimoy doing a better job delivering the line “I do not require a Bacchanale.”) So much of this show is now about his romantic pursuits, or those pursuing him, and it works.

Spending time with these characters feels like spending time with friends. What's lacking are really meaningful storylines to put them into, culminating in a very dispiriting episode that features zombies. “Star Trek” does not, now or ever, need zombies. An “escape room” archaeological dig episode isn't vastly better either.

 










The one absolute triumph of an episode is the one that goes all-out in just being a lark: “Trek” should probably have its “lark” episodes and then more serious episodes, giving us a variety of tones while keeping them distinct. This particular “lark” episode, directed masterfully as always by Jonathan Frakes, involves the Enterprise testing out a holodeck (not a spoiler, its distinctive grid pattern was seen in the official teaser) via an Agatha Christie-style whodunnit that La'an has to solve. 

But it's not just a Christie-style mystery, it's one set in 1960s Hollywood and about a murder on the set of a space adventure show that's basically just a redressed “Original Series,” with “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” style abounding. It's an absolute blast, and it reminds that through these first five episodes we don't get nearly enough of Rebecca Romijn as first officer Number One or Celia Rose Gooding's Uhura. This show has always been good at spreading the wealth, so it's likely they'll get their moments before Season 3 wraps. And wait till you see who Mount is playing in that holodeck episode.

That installment is great, but even still, hanging over all five of these episodes is a whiff of “what is this show about now?” The relative lack of substance across the board can't help feeling like a cop out for a show that's been capable of a lot more. God forbid the avoidance of anything topical is another expression of Paramount looking to avoid any potential confrontations ahead of its proposed merger with Skydance. It may not be that, but it's starting to look like the decision to wrap the series after a six-episode fifth season shoots later this year is a good one. 

 










After the five episodes we've screened of Season 3, there are likely only 21 episodes left. Let's hope, with a real plan, showrunners Akiva Goldsman and Henry Alonso Myers can truly make them count.

“Star Trek: Strange New Worlds” Season 3 premiered at the 2025 Tribeca Festival. It will stream on Paramount+ starting July 17, releasing a new episode each week.

Additional celebrities including Anna Kendrick, Gina Rodriguez-LoCicero and Tessa Thompson were out on Saturday to protest against the Trump administration. 



		By Lexi Carson, McKinley Franklin 

	June 14, 2025 2:56pm	




	Hollywood is out participating in the “No Kings” protests.


	People are protesting all across the country, including in major cities like Los Angeles and New York City, against President Donald Trump and his policies, just hours ahead of his military parade for the U.S. Army's 250th Anniversary in Washington on Saturday, which is also Trump‘s birthday.




Mark Ruffalo spoke with MSNBC at a protest in New York City and was asked why people were out protesting in the rain “to send a message,” to which he responded, “Because we see our democracy is in real trouble.”

	“We see a president who has made himself a king and dictator, and we don't seen an opposition that's powerful enough to stand up against the trampling of our rights and the trampling of the Constitution that's happening every single day with executive orders, with the refusal to obey court orders, kidnapping of immigrants, people who are here legally, people who their children are being taken from them,” Ruffalo added. “We're disgusted and we're scared, and we know that the only way that — to fight this now is for the people, is to come together.”

I met many people who love this country and still believe it to be a force for good. I am grateful to see so many Americans take action to stand up for our friends and neighbors, most of all, my parents,” he wrote on Instagram. “I know how fortunate I am to have been born into a family that taught me to care about others and that the most important words ever spoken are ‘Love one another.'

It's no secret that Supernatural was always at its best when it committed to being a horror series. Hunting down ghosts, monsters, demons, and otherworldly creatures was where the Winchesters thrived, and each new case opened the door to some personal and intimate drama. But there is one Supernatural episode that sticks out as being a masterclass in comedic timing, blending the show's intense mytharc with one of the most ingenious characters the series put together. Give up? I'm talking about Season 5's "Changing Channels," which makes me laugh and holler every time I turn it on.

When "Changing Channels" starts, we're already thrown head-first into the wild antics that are about to ensure. With an intro that feels like Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) have been transported to a bad '90s sitcom, we're then delighted with a theme song (dubbed "Together We'll Face the Day") that shows us just what we're in store for. Frankly, there are few comedic episodes of the show that are structured as well as "Changing Channels," and it's easy to see why it remains such a fan favorite to this day. It's certainly one of my favorite episodes, even if I generally prefer the show's standard horror dramas. What other show can throw its leading characters into "TV Land" (or "TV Hell," if you rather), flipping through different genres and shows as if some otherworldly viewer were changing channels on them? Penned by future showrunner Jeremy Carver, "Changing Channels" is quite inspired.

This episode takes the Winchesters through soapy medical dramas, Japanese game shows, a Knight Rider parody, and more. The only thing really missing is a Western, but the show would get to that the following season. As the Winchesters are sucked into a reality where they must pretend to survive, the theme of the episode becomes "play your roles," which has a double meaning by the end. There's so much to unpack here, with plenty of hilarious "in" moments and references for longtime fans, not to mention all the great material for Ackles and Padalecki to work with. Of course, it's also a Trickster (Richard Speight Jr.) episode, so just like "Tall Tales" or "Mystery Spot," we can expect this one to get a bit crazy, and it delivers in the best of ways.

In a season that was so often focused on the looming Apocalypse, "Changing Channels" uniquely addresses Sam and Dean's destiny while still living up to the show's clever and hilarious antics. The beauty of it is that the episode can really be enjoyed as-is, whether you are invested in the overall plotline or not. It's endlessly rewatchable. I've certainly shown this single episode to folks who had only vague ideas of what Supernatural is about, and the response is always the same. There's something about the way that Padalecki and Ackles play Sam and Dean that always feels universal and accessible, no matter the context of previous episodes. "Changing Channels" certainly fits that bill.

Ever since Season 2's "Tall Tales" and "Hollywood Babylon," Supernatural steered further and further into the meta space, and Season 5 is where a lot of that comes to a head. "The Real Ghostbusters" is all about Sam and Dean's five-season story, including fans in the narrative. But "Changing Channels" (which aired only a week prior) explored these meta ideas another way. On the Japanese game show "Nutcracker!," for instance, the episode asks Sam and Dean questions about their life and childhood. But, because the host is speaking in Japanese, it's only the audience (who has the benefit of subtitles) that is privy to what is being discussed. (I love the whole bit about Sam being asked about his connections to Ruby, it's a great in-joke that works perfectly for devoted fans.) Additionally, the show riffs on other shows and genres as well, spoofing Grey's Anatomy, NCIS, and other procedurals that so often feel like the same thing over and over again.

As the show continued, episodes like "The French Mistake" and "Fan Fiction" would continue this trend, but only "Changing Channels" was able to blend meta humor about Supernatural itself with television as a whole. What I think is especially great is that it doesn't just stick to the types of shows or content currently on air. The sitcom sequence feels a bit dated compared to many of the sitcoms that were popular at the time (The Office comes to mind), and the Knight Rider bit at the end is undoubtedly a callback to '80s television. That's not even getitng into the commercial sequence for "Herpexia," where Sam is forced to talk about his experience with genital herpes.

It's a surprisingly heartfelt declaration of love and gives a behind-the-scenes look at 'Supernatural.'

In addition to naming the aforementioned "The French Mistake" as one of his favorite episodes, series creator Eric Kripke told Entertainment Weekly in 2016 that "Changing Channels" was his other most-watched episode. It's not hard to understand why. While "The French Mistake" is a love-letter to Supernatural as a television production, "Changing Channels" is a Winchester power hour that perfectly unites the show's occasionally campy tone with the intensity of the Apocalypse story at the heart of Sam and Dean's life. Sure, there are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments here worth enjoying, but the way the brothers' journey through this TV Hell leads to a full-on confrontation with the Trickster (revealed to be the archangel Gabriel) about the importance of loyalty and family, makes the end of the episode just as strong dramatically as the rest of it is comedically.

Although he didn't write the episode, I fully understand why Kripke is drawn to both "Changing Channels" and "The French Mistake." They may depart from the tone of the show's earliest years, but they do so in a way that honors the show's own metamorphosis over the span of five and six seasons. Which one is better? It's hard to say, and I think that's why Kripke cites both as his favorite episodes rather than choosing between them. But if you're looking to revisit a great Supernatural episode with hysterical stakes and a deep, impactful ending, then "Changing Channels" ought to be the one you choose. There are few episodes of any "spooky procedural" out there as hilarious as this one.

Supernatural is available for streaming on Netflix.

While many moments may qualify, this one marked a dark turn for the series.

If you didn't cry by the end of this episode, you're worse than the monsters the Winchesters hunt.

“Miracles happen here.”

That's the slogan of one megachurch in southwest Miami-Dade County at the forefront of the fast-growing Christian “supernatural” movement.

It's an Evangelical offshoot, rooted in Pentecostalism, that leans far more heavily into revelations and prophecy than mainstream Christian churches and wields out-sized powerful political influence.

That was evident recently at King Jesus Ministry, a nondenominational megachurch where President Donald Trump's top spiritual advisor, pastor Paula White-Cain, has been a visitor over the years. The church hosted a three-day spiritual conference called the “Supernatural School of the Spirit,” where White-Cain and other visiting pastors preached and instructed crowds of followers and local faith leaders on how to “walk in the supernatural.”

King Jesus is just one of the largest South Florida churches steeped in the movement. Another Miami megachurch with a prominent Haitian-American congregation, Tabernacle of Glory, has credited its large following with its emphasis on the supernatural. The nondenominational church opened its $60 million campus in northern Miami-Dade County last year.

At these churches, it's not uncommon to hear pastors talking about ‘dominion' theologies or ‘cosmic spiritual warfare.' Sometimes, they may speak in tongues or even perform a ‘deliverance' or what most people know as an exorcism, to cast out demonic forces.

Religious scholars say the branch springs from a movement called ‘Independent charismatic Christianity' that gained momentum in the 1960s. Its followers, estimated to be in the millions in America, hold supernatural beliefs and goals of transforming secular society. They've built increasing influence in American politics, supporting candidacies of conservative leaders like President Donald Trump.

“Independent Charismatic leaders, who 20 years ago would have been mocked by mainstream religious right leaders, are now front-line captains in the American culture wars,” writes religious scholar Matthew Taylor, in his book “The Violent Take it By Force.”

The Miami Herald spoke to Taylor to discuss some of the themes and ideologies that are found in these churches and how they intersect with American political circles.

This term is popular in charismatic Christian circles and might refer to a church where supernatural experiences — some not defined by logic or reason — take place.

But the charismatic Christian world also is a “diffuse” space, where many terms are interchangeable or sometimes defined differently from church to church, said Taylor.

“Sometimes charismatics will call themselves charismatic. Sometimes they'll say they're spirit-filled ... sometimes they'll just say they're Christians. Sometimes they'll call themselves Evangelicals,” said Taylor, a senior Christian scholar at the Institute for Islamic, Christian, and Jewish Studies in Baltimore who spent 30 years of his life as an Evangelical Christian.

“To be charismatic is to seek after the more supernatural dimensions of Christianity ... and this is why they're constantly emphasizing prophecy, constantly emphasizing speaking in tongues and healings and miracles,” said Taylor.

The term ‘supernatural' is not new, and has been circulating for decades within the charismatic Christian movement. There's an entire Christian media network, for example, led by charismatic leader Sid Roth called “It's Supernatural! that has been around for decades, said Taylor. Believers will appear on the network to tell stories about the miracles they've witnessed.

One belief that unifies this Christian subculture is the idea that God speaks through prophecy. Many of the leaders in this movement — like Pastor Guillermo Maldonado of King Jesus and White-Cain — are considered by the faithful to be modern-day Apostles or Prophets who can perform ‘healings' or deliver prophecies during sermons.

Since the movement often operates without a formal connection to more established denominations, leaders may have varying degrees of theological education but will lean on or cite mentors in the movement. The leaders often have ten or hundreds of thousands of followers, or a background in televangelism, and their success can sometimes depend on who they know in the charismatic world — similar, Taylor writes, to how Hollywood operates.

Taylor, who has interviewed many charismatic Christian leaders, describes them as “idiosyncratic” and “incredibly compelling” people. “They're very socially skilled,” he said. “They're very good at reaching and teaching and providing people with these compelling experiences.”

Many apostolic leaders believe the Christian church has languished for centuries, and that God has brought them in to reinvigorate the church through Holy Spirit-backed leadership.

Common themes focus on “End-times,” or the second coming of Jesus, and a the idea of ‘dominion,' or Christians needing to conquer various aspects of society.

There's also an emphasis, similar to Pentecostal churches, on promoting inner healing through living a more Christian lifestyle. The promise of a better, healthier life can appeal to those who are struggling with addiction problems, health — physical or mental — problems or financial hardship. Prosperity — achieving financial wealth — also is a key theme, one that goes hand-in-hand with financial giving to the church. This idea is common in many churches that ask members to ‘tithe,' but this movement stresses that more giving can mean more rewards.

Many followers find a sense of empowerment, contentment and community in the movement, Taylor says.

“There have been studies even on how Pentecostal and charismatic ministries around the world have done a great deal of lifting people out of a lower-class existence economically by empowering them and telling them ‘Hey, you have agency.'”

At the same time, Taylor points out, those experiences are “being utilized in this broader political project,” to get more Christians on board with conservative political agendas.

Another theory of why it's so popular: In a modern, industrialized world where knowledge is at the fingertips of everyone with a Smartphone, charismatic leaders could be ‘re-enchanting' the world for people who want more of a sense of mystery and wonder, said Taylor, referring to the concept of ‘disenchantment' made popular by philosopher, Charles Taylor.

“People want a sense of a sublime and powerful force in the universe that's guiding and moving them around,” he said.

According to Taylor, independent charismatics are the fastest-growing religious demographic in the United States and around world. The followers are well into the millions, or hundreds of millions worldwide by some estimates, but the actual number is hard to measure, since the group is not tied to a formal denomination.

“For people who are searching for an anchor in the world or searching for self-confidence or searching for a sense of what their purpose is in life, ... they're scratching where people itch,” Taylor said.

It's similar, but without the bylaws and bureaucratic oversight that comes with a denomination, or network of churches with an established hierarchy.

“They believe that ‘We need the Holy Spirit to be unrestrained. We need the fires of revival prayer,' said Taylor. “But that same lack of restraint makes it very susceptible to political co-optation, because .. there's not a lot of oversight.”

Pentecostalism, a movement within Protestant Christianity, is a denomination that can be traced back as early as 1900's and emphasizes manifestations of the Holy Spirit — such as supernatural healing and speaking in tongues. In the early years of Pentecostalism, its followers were largely poor Angelo and African Americans, according to Pew Research, and women have always had a large role.

In the late-1940s, various ‘healing evangelists' began traveling around the country, filling tents and auditoriums that attracted tens of thousands of people, according to Taylor's book. Some of the preachers, like Oral Roberts, were Pentecostal preachers who found their way on television to bring the movement out of tents and into the mainstream world.

In the 1950s, Roberts teamed up with preacher Kenneth Hagin and began teaching about an ideology called the “Word of Faith” doctrine, which emphasized a form of faith that rewards devout Christians with healings and blessings. The ideas found in the doctrine gave rise to what is known today as the ‘prosperity gospel.'

Some religious scholars, many who are Christians themselves, point out that the movement is also putting spiritual influence to other uses. Leaders aim to exert more influence over everything from popular culture and education to politics. It's that latter field where the supernatural movement and other Evangelicals have arguably had the most success.

Last week at King Jesus Ministry, for instance, White-Cain outlined a vision of a society transformed by Christian ideology, urging believers to play a role in making it a reality.

“You didn't come to fit in, You came to take over. You came to move in your Kingdom calling. That threatens people who don't understand the word of God because their language, their understanding is not like yours. God birthed you to rule, to have dominion,” she said.

White-Cain has been one of the most influential voices in charismatic Christianity, and is someone who was able to bring its ideology into the mainstream and now, as the head of the newly established White House Faith Office, into American politics.

“Very soon our Lord and savior Jesus Christ is going to split the sky and come back,” she said during her sermon. “This is not your home, this is your assignment. And you and I have to reap the harvest.”

Celebrity psychic John Edward is in Australia for a series of his famous live medium events in the coming weeks. 

But the American mystic left the stars of The Project less than impressed when he refused to do a reading live on air on Sunday night. 

The 55-year-old was asked by host Sam Taunton, 'are you feeling anything from anyone at the desk right now?' 

'Not at the moment, not at the moment' Edwards admitted, to which co-host Waleed Aly replied, 'Well I could have done that!' 

The mockery sparked laughter from the show's panel of hosts, leaving a red-faced Edward to explain why he won't do readings live on television.

Celebrity psychic John Edward (pictured) is in Australia for a series of his famous live medium events in the coming weeks

'I tell you why. If I read for a host of a show and I get something private, this is not taped, it's live, and it's not something that someone wants to discuss publicly, you're going to say no' he said. 

'I've had a bad experience. On radio, many, many years ago. I was reading for a Christian conservative host of a radio show. 

'He said, "I have legacy in the marketplace, my audience knows everything about me". I said, "okay." 

'He was being very difficult. In the commercial break, I said, does your audience know you decided not to to have a fifth child and terminate the pregnancy? 

'He was like, "no". I asked him, "If I would have said that on the air, what would you have said? [he replied] "I would have had to lie because my mother-in-law listens to the show."' 

John recently has issued a strong message to his non-believers. 

Speaking to The Daily Telegraph, the medium said he has no qualms about people questioning his abilities - as they have done for decades - but only if they are willing to open their mind. 

'I think we're living at a time on the planet where people's critical thinking skills need to be really sharpened and addressed because of whatever the latest AI thing that's happening or just social media – so I think it's really important for people to go, "hey, wait, I'm not sure, let me see what kind of validation is there"' he said.

'I've had a bad experience. On radio, many, many years ago. I was reading for a Christian conservative host of a radio show' he explained 

'So I welcome it [scepticism] – it's important – as long as we can have a conversation about it.

'But when somebody pushes a little bit too much more, then I have to push back, and I have to be like 'woah – you can't define me, you don't know me'. 

The New York native also said that he can't wait to return to Australia, as he has always loved the country's 'energy'.

He praised the nation's strong sense of community and said Australians always make him feel welcome when he visits.

Edward rose to fame in 2001 with his controversial Crossing Over program, in which he claimed to speak to the deceased relatives of audience members. 

His supposed psychic abilities have been dismissed by many, with critics claiming the reality star is merely practicing a form of cold reading.

He has been married to Sandra McGee since 1995 and the couple share two children: son Justin and daughter Olivia.

Back in 2017, Edward told news.com.au that he never set out to be a celebrity and that it simply happened as a result of his psychic abilities.

'I never woke up and decided, 'I'm going to be a world famous medium',' John said.

'And I never wanted to be on TV, it was an opportunity that came as a byproduct of my work.'

A mysterious metallic sphere was captured soaring above a field in Colombia, just two months after locals recovered a similar object many are calling a UFO.

The footage, filmed on June 7 over a sugarcane field in Yumbo, shows the sphere darting in a zigzag pattern and maneuvering in ways that appear to defy conventional aircraft. 

Witnesses described the object as 'moving with great speed and freedom' as it hovered above the ground. 

However, many people said the object is either a balloon or the video was created using AI.

UFO researcher Jaime Maussan, whose research has stirred controversy for nearly a decade, released the video on his show, Maussan Television. 

He described the sphere as 'likely not from here' and suggested it may be a technology humans do not yet possess.

'When the workers were investigating the crops, this sphere appeared and they were able to capture it with state-of-the-art equipment. The images are truly extraordinary,' Maussan said. He added that the latest sphere appeared nearly identical to the first, recovered in Buga, about 43 miles from Yumbo. 

Scientists who analyzed the latest video said the object emits an electromagnetic field, generates strong heat and may possess antigravity capabilities.

'We believe these spheres are investigating, observing us, possibly searching for the first one recovered in Buga,' Maussan said in a translated statement.

'Could we be on the path to contact? That's the extraordinary question we're asking today.'

The first Buga sphere, recovered on March 2 by locals, weighed about 4.5 pounds and was described as 'having the temperature of a refrigerator when touched, but emitting strong heat when not.'

A team led by Guatemalan researcher Jose Manrique analyzed the Yumbo video and insisted it had been manipulated by A. 

If it is indeed identical to the first, the object may be inscribed with strange 'alien' writing, a message for humanity, which Manrique's team previously deciphered to say: 'The origin of birth through union and energy in the cycle of transformation, meeting point of unity, expansion, and consciousness — individual consciousness.'

Manrique interpreted it as 'a message to humanity, encouraging a collective shift in consciousness to help Mother Earth, especially considering the current issues with pollution and environmental decline.'

The identities of the workers who filmed the Yumbo sphere have not been made public, but Maussan said the video was sent to David Vélez el Potro, a key figure in the recovery of the Buga sphere.

Vélez el Potro told Maussan in March that the man who found it, Jose, felt sick for days after touching the object.

He also claimed that the government contacted him to hand it over the sphere, but he refused, saying, 'It would never be seen again.'

Instead, Vélez el Potro gave it to Maussan and his team of experts with hopes of them uncovering the sphere's origin. 

Scientists who examined the Buga sphere said it comprises 18 microspheres surrounding a central nucleus, a configuration some are calling 'a chip.'

However, Dr Julia Mossbridge of the University of San Diego Department of Physics and Biophysics, has doubted the authenticity of Buga sphere, calling it a 'man-made art project.'

A team of scientists have recently analyzed the sphere using X-rays and conducted other tests to identify its origins

Researchers from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) recently released a new analysis, suggesting a strong, decayed ionized field emits from the Buga sphere.

 Rodolfo Garrido, a Mexican engineer, said his team weighed the sphere numerous times and were surprised to find it growing heavier, from 16 to 20 and then 22 pounds, without changing in size.

Garrido explained that this phenomenon may be due to the object's ability to manipulate gravity and generate its own electromagnetic field, allowing it to become lighter or heavier at will.

The revelations were presented on Maussan's TV program Interstellar, although the journalist's involvement has raised eyebrows. 

Maussan has previously made headlines for sensational, and subsequently debunked, claims, including mummified corpses and other supposed extraterrestrial finds. 

Nonetheless, the latest incident has captured the imagination of many and ignited a heated debate about what, or who, might be visiting us from the skies above.

New James Webb Space Telescope data reveal Pluto's high-altitude haze is a key driver of the climate on the dwarf planet, offering clues to Earth's ancient atmosphere.

Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have taken a fresh look at the distant edges of our solar system — and found that, once again, Pluto is defying expectations.

When NASA's New Horizons spacecraft flew past Pluto in 2015, it shattered the notion that the dwarf planet was a dormant ball of ice, instead revealing it to be rich with icy plains and jagged mountains. But one of the biggest surprises floated above it all: a bluish, multi-layered haze blanketing the world's sky, stretching more than 185 miles (300 kilometers) above the surface — far higher and more intricate than scientists had predicted.

Now, nearly a decade later, new data from JWST confirm that Pluto's haze isn't just a visual oddity, it also controls the dwarf planet's climate.

"This is unique in the solar system," Tanguy Bertrand, an astronomer at the Paris Observatory in France who led the analysis, told Live Science. "It's a new kind of climate, let's say."

The findings, described in a study published June 2 in the journal Nature Astronomy, suggest similar dynamics may be at play on other haze-shrouded worlds in our solar system, and even offer clues about our own planet's early climate.

Pluto's high-altitude haze is made of complex organic molecules from sunlight-driven reactions of methane and nitrogen. The idea that this haze could control Pluto's climate was first proposed in 2017. Computer models suggested these particles absorb sunlight during the day and release it back into space as infrared energy at night, cooling the atmosphere much more efficiently than gases alone. This could also explain why Pluto's upper atmosphere is roughly -333 degrees Fahrenheit (-203 degrees Celsius) — 30 degrees cooler than expected.

For years, however, testing that theory proved difficult. One major challenge was Pluto's large moon, Charon, which orbits the frigid planet so closely that their thermal signals often overlap in telescope data. "Basically, we couldn't know what part of the signal is due to Charon and what part is due to Pluto's haze," Bertrand said.

The researchers behind the 2017 study predicted that Pluto's haze would make the world unusually bright in mid-infrared wavelengths — a prediction that, at the time, could only be tested with future instruments. That opportunity arrived in 2022, when JWST's powerful infrared instruments were finally able to separate the two worlds' signals. Sure enough, the faint infrared glow of Pluto's haze matched the predictions.

"In planetary science, it's not common to have a hypothesis confirmed so quickly, within just a few years," Xi Zhang, a planetary scientist at the University of California, Santa Cruz who led the 2017 team, said in a statement. "So we feel pretty lucky and very excited."

These findings also open up the possibility that similar haze-driven climates might exist on other hazy worlds, such as Neptune's moon Triton or Saturn's moon Titan, Bertrand said.

Even Earth's distant past might bear a resemblance, the researchers said. Before oxygen transformed our planet's skies, it's possible that Earth was veiled in a haze of organic particles — a blanket that may have helped stabilize temperatures and foster early life.

"By studying Pluto's haze and chemistry, we might get new insights into the conditions that made early Earth habitable," Zhang said in the statement.

Joseph Gutheinz, a retired senior special agent with NASA's Office of Inspector General and current criminal defense attorney, discussed the existence of UFOs with Fox News Digital.

In an era captivated by unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and government conspiracies, one former NASA official is cutting through the noise and casting doubt on aliens coming to Earth.

Joseph Gutheinz, a retired senior special agent with NASA's Office of Inspector General and current criminal defense attorney, said it's time to apply science, not speculation, to the debate.

"Prove it. Honestly, prove it," he said to those who believe in the presence of UFOs on Earth.

"They've been claiming that there have been UFOs since the 1940s. And, you know, Area 51 supposedly houses UFOs," he told Fox News Digital. "Have someone go in, look at Area 51."

Gutheinz said that during his work with the NASA Office of Inspector General, he would regularly get calls from individuals who believed they were abducted, or had a chip in their brain from aliens.

"What I used to tell my students was the possibility of anybody coming from another world to visit us was beyond unlikely," he said. "And what I would tell the people that would call me up with these tales about being visited by aliens, see a psychiatrist."

Citing astronomical distances and scientific understanding of the solar system, Gutheinz explained the improbability of any extraterrestrial visitors reaching Earth. 

"There are up to 400 billion stars in the Milky Way. There are maybe one to two trillion galaxies in the universe. But the reality is this, the closest solar system is Alpha Centauri. Alpha Centauri A, B, and Proxima Centauri are the closest stars," he said.

"The bottom line is that it's 4.4 light years away, or 25 trillion miles away. And if somebody started flying to Proxima and Satori, or the other way around, it would take them over 70,000 years to get there," he said. "Nobody is visiting us from another world, likely."

He pointed to moons like Europa, Ganymede, Titan, and Triton as the only plausible places for primitive life in our solar system. 

"If there is life on any of those moons, it's possible. Again, it is primitive, it is microorganisms, it's nothing that's going to visit us in a flying saucer."

When asked whether such sightings could be explained as natural or spiritual phenomena, he suggested that it could be government testing.

"If you're seeing something up there, and it's real, it's coming from the Chinese or the Russians or your next-door neighbor flying around with their drone," he said.

Historical military secrecy, Gutheinz suggested, may have played a major role in fostering the UFO myths.

"I believe early on in the 1940s when all these UFO stories started coming up, it was because the military was probably testing some aircraft, and they didn't want the Russians to know about it," he said.

"And so, if the UFO cover worked, and I would not be surprised if there are some people in the military and the government that played along with that in order to conceal our stealth technology, that is really remarkable, and they just don't want to share that with other countries."

"The bottom line is, I think that we use the UFO cover to hide a lot of things."
