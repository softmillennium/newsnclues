                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin trades above $105,000 even as the threat of war looms in the Middle East. HYPE, BCH, AAVE and OKB could also catch a bid if BTC holds its current range. A week of solid inflows into the spot Bitcoin ETFs improves the prospects of a rally toward $110,000. HYPE, BCH, AAVE, and OKB could march higher if Bitcoin sustains above $105,000. Bitcoin (BTC) is forming a Doji candlestick pattern on the weekly chart, indicating indecision between buyers and sellers. Despite the near-term uncertainty, analysts remain bullish on Bitcoin's prospects in 2025, expecting a rally from $140,000 to $270,000. Another positive sign is that the geopolitical turmoil caused by the conflict between Israel and Iran did not create panic among investors. According to Farside Investors' data, US-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds witnessed $86.3 million in inflows on Thursday and $301.7 million on Friday, boosting the total weekly inflows to $1.37 billion. Bitcoin's consolidation just below the all-time high has not generated a sell signal in any of the 30 “bull market peak” indicators monitored by CoinGlass. In a post on X, popular trader Cas Abbe said the models project a target between $135,000 to $230,000 for Bitcoin this cycle. Could Bitcoin rise toward $110,500, pulling select altcoins higher? If it does, let's look at the cryptocurrencies that look strong on the charts. That suggests a lack of buying at higher levels. Buyers are expected to vigorously defend the $100,000 level. The pair could then surge toward $110,530. Buyers have been struggling to maintain Hyperliquid (HYPE) above $42.50, indicating that bears are active at higher levels. A break and close above $44 will invalidate the negative divergence, opening the gates for a rally to $50. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it signals profit-booking by the bulls. If the 20-EMA is scaled, the pair could climb to $42.78 and then to $44. The uptrend will resume on a break above $44. Contrarily, a break and close below the 50-SMA suggests the bulls have given up. This is a crucial near-term support to watch out for because a break below the uptrend line could sink the pair to $30.50. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) bounced off the 50-day SMA ($403) on Friday, but the bulls are facing stiff resistance at $462. Buyers will try to arrest the decline at $375. If they succeed, the pair may consolidate between $375 and $462 for a while. If buyers do not allow the price to dip below $450, it improves the prospects of a break above $462. If that happens, the pair could surge toward $500. Related: Here's what happened in crypto today The price turned down sharply from $325 on Wednesday and has reached the 20-day EMA ($269). If they manage to do that, the pair could soar toward $380. Buyers are expected to defend the uptrend line with vigor. The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the 20-EMA. OKB (OKB) has been trading inside a descending channel pattern for several days. A minor advantage in favor of the bulls is that they have not allowed the price to fall to the $49 support. That signals buying on dips. Repeated retest of a resistance level tends to weaken it. If buyers pierce the resistance line, the pair could rally to $56 and then to $60. This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the $49 support. That suggests the pair may remain stuck inside the channel for a few more days. If the price turns down from the 20-EMA and breaks below $51, it suggests that bears are in control. The pair could then plummet toward $49. That increases the possibility of a rise to the resistance line, which is an important level to watch out for. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alon Muroch, founder of SSV Labs, gets candid about Ethereum's current challenges, and why attracting value back to ETH is crucial in its next chapter. Welcome to Slate Sundays, CryptoSlate's new weekly feature showcasing in-depth interviews, expert analysis, and thought-provoking op-eds that go beyond the headlines to explore the ideas and voices shaping the future of crypto. So much so, in fact, that beyond speaking at the Staking Summit, it's one of the forces at play bringing Alon to Dubai today, raising awareness about the elephant in the room no Eth bag holder wants to discuss. The Ethereum community needs to recognize it and then prioritize it, because this divergence will become very dangerous.” With 100,000 Ethereum validators, SSV Network secures around 10% of all staked ETH, so Alon is pretty invested in seeing the token price rise. That's why ETH is like this,” he bemoans. This is my first time meeting Alon, and I'm not familiar with his temperament, but I can tell there's a lot on his mind. The price of Eth, for one, which is languishing under $1,800. It's at least 20 minutes past our scheduled meeting time, and he's already ordered his coffee when I arrive at the crowded patio. After traversing the outdoor area between the conference hall and Madinat Souk in the punishing afternoon heat, my inclination is more toward a nice cold beer than a steaming hot cappuccino. I'm flustered and red-faced after walking round in circles, lost, deep in the souk's rat's nest of perfumes, textiles, stuffed camels, dates, and multiple other knick-knacks on sale. That Starbucks was harder to find than a patch of shade in the Sahara. I bet Alon didn't have as much trouble. After 10 years navigating his way through Ethereum's many twists, turns, and narrative changes, Google Maps was probably a walk in the park. I apologize for my poor map-reading skills and ask what drew him to Ethereum in the first place. With Eth price limping along like a wounded dog, a divided community bickering over its direction, and a score of alternative smart contract platforms offering better, faster, cheaper, I ask Alon whether Ethereum still holds that central role today. Obviously, there are blockchains with riskier technology or more cutting-edge technology, but they're much smaller, so it's much easier to do. Ethereum is seeing all-time high usage, so that's good.” “In terms of the token, it's lagging behind quite significantly, and there's a divergence happening there, which is quite risky for Ethereum. I can debate until tomorrow the difference between Solana, Cosmos, Polkadot, and Ethereum, and why Bitcoin is lagging behind as a technology. I can debate, but that's not translating very well to the actual frontiers of adoption right now.” Yet, if Ethereum's problem is simply about crafting a better narrative, why do projects migrate to other ecosystems in search of more favorable economic models, like Uniswap or dYdX? “There will always be projects preferring other blockchains. I think it's much more of a marketing opportunity than anything else. You can find very cheap transactions on Ethereum.” “The challenges Ethereum has right now are not technological. It's mostly narrative and a simple question: “Why would the average TradFi user, who doesn't really understand decentralization or TPS, and doesn't know how to differentiate between Solana and Cosmos, or Ethereum for that matter, hold Eth? He explains that traditionally, Ethereum didn't pay much attention to narratives, marketing, and PR, but times have changed, and it's becoming impossible to ignore. Now, if you look at Wall Street today, well, they might understand the concepts of decentralization and self-sovereignty, but they don't care about it. That's where the narrative plays a major role. It's coming up with a narrative that is compelling.” Finding a new raison d'être for Ethereum in the hearts and minds of token holders is no mean feat, particularly in an industry where not everyone is “in it for the tech.” When NGU ceases to deliver and prices bleed steadily down, Alon has his work cut out. The Solana narrative is “we can beat Ethereum.” So the reason to hold SOL is that if there's a price difference between tokens and SOL wins, it's better to hold SOL than anything else. “ETH has nobody to win and compete with. They're already the biggest smart contract platform, so there has to be another expansion. Historically, there were very good reasons to hold ETH. If we can make that and attract value back to Eth, the token, then there's a really good reason to hold it.” What makes Ethereum a good settlement layer compared to other blockchains? Bitcoin's security is widely renowned, I point out. “Bitcoin has zero capabilities of smart contracting, and so developers basically hacked ways to secure things on Bitcoin. Ethereum has smart contracts, so a lot of those types of use cases simply became contracts on Ethereum. What I'm saying is somewhere in that direction. I believe that the Ethereum validator set has superpowers. It's the largest, most diverse, and decentralized validator set on earth. Those validators know how to run high-performance software for a very long time. It has on-chain entities with performance and all of that, plus you see a lot more off-chain components responsible for very significant application services, and so on. If you can have all of those services run using validators on Ethereum and paying them rewards, then you have this stream of revenue and rewards going back to ETH holders.” Alon doesn't miss a chance to share his views on Bitcoin as legacy tech, but what are his thoughts on Solana, which seems to be the institutional investors' favorite toy? He replies that Ethereum's “last good competitors” were EOS, but they failed because “their founders did other things.” He says Solana is “basically what EOS should have been if they'd had serious founders,” but: “In terms of technical capabilities, Solana is taking way more trade-offs than Ethereum. Ethereum needs to take some of that into what they're doing.” Given the nature of Alon's business, I'm not surprised when he immediately shuts that down. The amount of resources required today to maintain Bitcoin is crazy. Fine, but it's not a really good answer to anything. I don't think Bitcoin will ever change to Proof of Stake because Bitcoin is stuck in the past in terms of advancement in technology… Of course, we should have switched. Besides alerting everyone to the problems Ethereum faces, what else is Alon doing to turn the Ethereum ship around? What are the based applications that SSV is pioneering? They're applications that are based in their security on Ethereum validators. It's a type of decentralized application that runs on Ethereum validators and gets functionality and security from them. It can be oracles or bridges, data availability, zk-proofs, AI agents, or whatever type of application you have that is run in a distributed way. Instead of reinventing the wheel and building your own validator set, you can simply tap into the Ethereum and get much better security, much cheaper, and also really connect to Ethereum in a much better way.” Where do based applications fit into the broader security landscape, and how do they stack up against, say, Eigenlayer? “Eigenlayer is similar in the sense that it provides security. The problem with that is that it's not scalable, and it's very expensive because capital is very expensive. What we decided to do is to go and use the validators themselves, which are 95% cheaper and provide properties that capital doesn't because they directly represent a portion of the value of Ethereum.” “That's very significant because security is the most expensive component of a decentralized service, and based applications are very aligned with Ethereum because, as I said before, it comes from the point of creating more value back to the holders, so it has that additional dimension… We need to present a way forward, which I think is by prioritizing a way to attract more value back to the token.” I wish him luck, and we conclude the interview. Despite dunking on Ethereum with as much frequency as Alon badmouthes Bitcoin, I can't imagine the crypto space without it, and I'd be sorry to see it unravel.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sure, bitcoin BTC$105,592.48 just hit new fresh highs and is still trading above $100,000, but the P&L is diminishing daily for short-term volatility chasers. "Bitcoin's volatility has continued to trend lower, both in realized and implied measures, even as the asset reaches new all-time highs. This decline in volatility is particularly notable amid historically high price levels," said NYDIG Research in a recent note shared with CoinDesk. Of course, this is perhaps a positive trend for bitcoin as it depicts a more maturing market and potentially speaks to its original promise of "store of value," as the price reaches fresh new highs. While fresh record highs might be great for long-term HODLers, for short-term traders, those juicy breakouts are getting hard to make money on. NYDIG is chalking it up to increased demand from bitcoin treasury companies, which seem to be popping up everywhere, and a rise in sophisticated trading strategies, such as options overwriting, as well as other forms of volatility selling. The market is getting more professional, and unless we see some true Black Swan events (FTX, anyone?) for crypto, prices will continue to remain calm. But all is not lost — there are always opportunities to make money even when it's not as lucrative as it seems. "The decline in volatility has made both upside exposure through calls and downside protection via puts relatively inexpensive," said NYDIG. Translation: Hedging and catalyst-driven plays are where the money might be in this market. So bitcoin's summer lull might not be a total dead zone; rather, it's a setup for those who are willing to play the patience game and hedge accordingly to trade potential market-moving events.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>RTX, a new PayFi platform, has raised more than $15.5 million and sold more than 527 million tokens at $0.0781. With a Q3 wallet launch and a 50% token bonus on the table, investors are betting on real-world payment utility—not memes. Rollouts like ShibaSwap and Shibarium have failed to help SHIB regain the lost momentum. Long-term investors are beginning to lose hope for hitting all-time highs. As Shiba Inu price action slows, SHIB whales are looking towards use-case-driven projects. Remittix is gaining popularity with its focus on faster crypto-to-fiat settlement in 24 hours. While Shiba's roadmap targets scalability and DeFi, actual adoption is still not extensive. That's partly why even big SHIB holders are investigating alternatives. Projections do not indicate SHIB crossing $0.00003 anytime in the near future, and competition for memecoins is increasing. The majority desire projects like RTX with precise use cases and tokenomics reflecting real-world financial systems. A shop owner in Eastern Europe, for example, already uses Remittix to accept USD settlements from crypto customers through their dashboard interface. Shiba Inu's price wave taught traders the lesson of how quickly hype can be forgotten. As of 2025, returns are driven by utility, not virality. For this reason, there's more capital flowing into Remittix, a project that is addressing real financial problems with faster returns. Disclaimer: This content is provided by a sponsor.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shiba inu's (SHIB) supply-side dynamics are screaming bullish, yet the second-largest joke cryptocurrency by market value trades under pressure. Early this week, SHIB's burn rate surged to over 112,000%, with more than 116 million coins transferred to wallets that cannot spend money. In other words, these coins were permanently taken out of circulation. The daily burn rate refers to the number of SHIB tokens permanently destroyed or removed from circulation each day. "Over 527 trillion SHIB tokens are approaching profitability, while the burn rate exploded 112,839% with 116 million tokens removed from circulation," CoinDesk's AI insights noted. Furthermore, SHIB's ecosystem fundamentals demonstrated strength, with record wallet growth exceeding 1.5 million unique addresses and significant increases in Shibarium layer-2 transactions. Still, the memecoin remained locked in a downtrend at press time, last changing hands at $0.00001190, representing a 2% drop over the past 24 hours and a nearly 5% decline for the week. Overnight, the token faced strong selling pressure, with above-average volume exceeding 500 billion units, establishing resistance around $0.0000122.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin and crypto have surged this year as traders bet U.S. president Donald Trump's administration will further boost the bitcoin price (helped by Treasury secretary Scott Bessent issuing a surprise crypto market prediction). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has traded above $100,000 per bitcoin since early May after rebounding from Trump's tariff-induced slump as rumors swirl of a looming, “extraordinary” White House update. “The version of the Genius Act that we will invoke cloture on today reflects months of hard work and negotiations from members on both sides of the aisle,” Republican majority leader John Thune said in comments reported by Politico, adding, "it's time to move forward and pass this legislation." If sent onto Trump's desk for his signature, the Genius Act would provide a legal and regulatory framework for stablecoins—a form of bitcoin-inspired cryptocurrency that's usually pegged to the U.S. dollar and used to move money around the world more quickly and cheaply than traditional payment rails. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent echoed a report from analysts with Standard Chartered Bank this week when he predicted U.S. stablecoin legislation would boost the market 10-fold to around $2 trillion. Trump has fully embraced bitcoin and crypto over the last year, following through on his campaign promise to create a U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve via an executive order in March and also launching his own memecoin and U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin via his family's World Liberty Financial project. Trump's growing ties to crypto, which Forbes found has added around $1 billion to his personal wealth, has been used by Democratic Party lawmakers to campaign against the Genius Act, with Democratic representative Jamie Raskin from Maryland warning last month that Trump's crypto ventures offered the “perfect opportunity for foreign government, corporate and individual funds to be funneled into Donald Trump's bank account and his family's finances.” Bitcoin and crypto traders expecting clarity on stablecoin regulation has helped support the bitcoin price in recent months that's been rocked along with stock markets by trade tensions. “Bitcoin appears to be consolidating above $100,000,” David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said in emailed comments, pointing to the settling market turmoil caused by Trump's global trade war.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Switch to the United States site for products available in your region. Hong Kong's central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiative, known as e-HKD+, has entered a groundbreaking phase with the integration of Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). This pilot program demonstrates the transformative potential of blockchain technology in facilitating secure, efficient cross-border transactions between permissioned and permissionless blockchains. With major financial institutions like Visa, ANZ, Fidelity International, and ChinaAMC participating, the study highlights the growing institutional interest in tokenized assets and programmable digital currencies. By leveraging Chainlink's CCIP, the pilot program seeks to address key challenges in cross-border payments, such as counterparty risk and settlement delays. The protocol allows for secure data and value transfers without the need for traditional asset bridging, solving critical interoperability challenges. Stablecoin Conversion: Australian investors deposit AUD and receive A$DC tokens on ANZ's private blockchain (DASchain). The pilot program is backed by leading financial institutions, each contributing to its execution and success: Visa: Provided its Tokenized Asset Platform (VTAP) for managing the digital money lifecycle. ANZ: Issued the A$DC stablecoin and connected its proprietary blockchain to Ethereum's testnet. Fidelity International and ChinaAMC: Demonstrated the application of tokenized funds in streamlining investment processes. Enhanced Security: On-chain identity verification ensures compliance and reduces fraud. Operational Efficiency: Supports transactions outside standard business hours, including weekends and holidays. These advancements promise to boost global liquidity and transparency. Public Adoption: CBDCs face skepticism among private citizens due to concerns over privacy and centralization. Institutional Use Cases: Financial institutions are increasingly adopting blockchain solutions for their efficiency and security. Chainlink's CCIP has proven to be a pivotal technology in Hong Kong's e-HKD+ pilot, bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized ecosystems. By enabling secure, instant cross-border transactions, the protocol is setting a new standard for CBDC interoperability. Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is a blockchain technology that enables secure communication and value transfer between different blockchain networks. e-HKD+ reduces settlement times, enhances security through on-chain identity verification, and supports transactions outside standard business hours. CBDCs are often criticized for their lack of anonymity and centralization, which raises privacy concerns.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The cryptocurrency had gone mainstream enough for late adopters like myself to deem it investable. I wanted to try multiple methods of investing in bitcoin. Sure, positive investor sentiment led to gains in bitcoin, as well as the ETF I bought that was designed to track the crypto. Almost six months later, bitcoin has crossed new all-time-highs, and I have mixed feelings on my investment. I didn't want the hassle of setting up a Coinbase account. Year-to-date, IBIT is up about 14%, outpacing a 12% gain for bitcoin itself. It's done its job of tracking the crypto, and even added a little extra. And it's far outperformed the S&P 500, which is up just 2% in 2025. But if you want a rough proxy of bitcoin performance without actually owning the underlying asset, IBIT gets the job done. A year and a half over its launch, IBIT has gained incredible popularity, growing to over $70 billion in assets under management. Robert Cannon, a financial advisor at Experity Wealth with a specialization in alternative assets, recommends his bitcoin-curious clients to start with the ETF. "It's the easiest, cleanest representation of bitcoin, compared to some of the other strategies that are a bit esoteric," Cannon told me. Getting bitcoin exposure through other methods was indeed more esoteric — and much less profitable. I added Semler Scientific to my portfolio on January 8, 2025, and it's down more than 40% since then. There's a growing trend among companies to add bitcoin to their balance sheets, with Strategy, Tesla, and GameStop being one of the most prominent examples. The president's own Trump Media and Technology Group has recently raised $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin. Semler Scientific started adding bitcoin to its balance sheet in May of last year and now holds over 4,000 bitcoins. It sounds like a good idea in theory: holding bitcoin as a reserve asset could be a hedge against inflation and dollar weakness, and could also lead to capital appreciation as bitcoin takes off. However, it's hard to replicate the scale and expertise of Strategy. While many of Cannon's clients often inquire about bitcoin treasury companies like Strategy, he usually recommends they stick to the basics with an ETF. The company had been under investigation from the Department of Justice for allegedly misleading claims about one of its medical devices. That includes everything from management decisions and financial health to legal exposure, product performance, and market sentiment around the core business. As a result, the benefits of diversification with bitcoin are watered down. If you're looking for bitcoin exposure, either buying the real thing or a spot ETF is your best bet. Maybe the strategy from here on out is to close out of my position in SMLR and do some tax-loss harvesting this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While fear grips the broader crypto market and many traders are panic-selling their Ethereum holdings, one whale is taking the opposite approach, snapping up as many ETH tokens as possible amid the market crash. New data from blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain reports that this Ethereum whale has just scooped up a staggering $127 million worth of ETH, raising eyebrows across the crypto community and indicating that they may know something the market doesn't. This massive ETH haul, purchased from major crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Wintermute, is valued at a whopping $127 million. Notably, Lookonchain highlights that the large-scale purchase had occurred during a period of intense panic selling and crowd uncertainty. Highlighting the strategic prowess of this whale, the analytics platform revealed that they had previously pocketed an impressive $30 million in profits from an earlier ETH trade. Now, the large-scale investor appears to be re-entering the market, especially at a time when prices are projected to fall dramatically. Moving forward, Lookonchain reveals that the whale's recent $127 million ETH purchase was made at an average price of $2,605 per coin—a level that many in the retail crowd fear may still have room to fall. Transaction records also show large inflows of ETH into a single receiving wallet, with high-value transfers coming in quick succession. These included multi-million dollar movements from Coinbase hot wallets and Wintermute's trading addresses, consolidating tens of thousands of ETH coins in a short window. Before these ETH acquisitions, the whale had received over $127 million in USDC stablecoin, possibly suggesting a planned and calculated move rather than a spontaneous dip buy. While there's no direct evidence that this whale has insider information, the timing and scale of the ETH accumulation suggests a strong conviction in Ethereum's near-to-long-term outlook. This kind of aggressive buying rarely happens without premises, and based on prior buying behavior, this isn't just another speculative trader. As Lookonchain reported earlier, this Whale's wallet is linked to a history of well-timed ETH plays. Some highlight that their analysis based on the previous $30 million profit is proof of sharp market insight. Others believe that once the market settles down and exits its bearish phase, the investor could be positioned for even greater profits. Outside of his writing, Scott is passionate about promoting crypto literacy and often works to educate the public on the potential of blockchain.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon and Walmart are planning to launch their own stablecoins, joining the ranks of companies like PayPal, Meta, Ant Group, and Stripe. When household names like Amazon and Walmart explore stablecoins, it's clear that the future of money is being shaped not by banks or governments, but by corporate innovators. Also Read: “Naidu's Mega Scheme: Mothers to Receive Direct Aid for Children's Education” Stablecoins offer instant, borderless, low-cost transactions — unlike credit cards, which typically charge merchants 2–3.5% per transaction. This is why companies like Shopify have already enabled USDC payments on Coinbase's Base, empowering global merchants to accept stablecoins without legacy payment infrastructure. Regulators like Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal have already raised concerns, especially with Meta's renewed efforts. Yet the reality remains: governments don't easily surrender monetary control, and stablecoins represent a challenge to centralized financial power. But as with the internet before it, decentralization of money seems inevitable. These coins maintain a 1:1 value ratio by backing each token with equivalent reserves. When properly regulated, they allow for safe, fast, and transparent transfers of value. For many advocates, stablecoins represent more than efficiency — they're about freedom and control over one's money. “Whether transferring ₹100 or ₹10,000 crore, individuals should be able to move funds instantly, globally, and securely — without needing permission from a central bank.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto markets are entering a new phase of accumulation, with select altcoins setting the stage for potentially explosive growth. Early buyers are hunting for strong fundamentals, application-layer dominance, and platforms solving real-world issues. Among those drawing the most attention this week are Qubetics, Aptos, Solana, and Cosmos. They're real infrastructure projects with use cases, network activity, and expanding ecosystems. Qubetics in particular is setting itself apart with its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace and a crypto presale that's closing in on a major milestone. Let's dive into why these are the best crypto coins to buy right now and how each project is shaping the Web3 frontier. Qubetics is laying the rails for one of blockchain's most compelling real-world use cases—tokenizing tangible assets into digital ownership units. The Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace is built to turn real estate, equity shares, fine art, and precious metals into blockchain-registered assets, allowing people and businesses to buy, sell, and trade fractions globally. Professionals in supply chain, logistics, and capital markets are also using the protocol to enhance asset liquidity, digitize balance sheets, and manage compliance more efficiently. With verified identity features, asset vaulting, and AI-powered auditing, Qubetics is positioned as a compliance-ready launchpad for real-world finance. In the past 30 days, Qubetics has added 1,100+ tokenized asset pools to its beta platform. Institutional access layers have been introduced for banks and family offices, featuring KYC/AML-compliant APIs. A recent technical update has also improved node reliability by 18% across Europe and Southeast Asia, expanding validator access and reducing operational latency. The Qubetics crypto presale is nearing its end—and it's gaining serious momentum. The presale price of $0.3370 is fixed.After that, the token will list publicly at $0.40—offering a 20% price bump to those who lock in now. This final-stage urgency is further compounded by the reduced total supply. With only 38.55% allocated for public circulation, Qubetics is positioning itself as a supply-constrained utility asset. For a $2,500 allocation at the current stage, returns could reach $74,925 if $TICS hits $10. Should it climb to $15 post-mainnet—as forecasted by analysts following its cross-border utility expansion—returns could exceed $112,000. Why did this coin make it to this list: Qubetics is solving a real problem with an elegant, scalable solution. Its RWA marketplace, proven rollout strategy, and crypto presale structure make it one of the best crypto coins to buy in June 2025. Using a parallel execution engine and the Move programming language (originally built by Meta engineers), Aptos can handle thousands of simultaneous transactions with high throughput and low latency. Its modular architecture allows for independent updates to consensus, execution, and data storage. This design is gaining popularity among fintech apps, gaming platforms, and high-frequency trading protocols needing low response times. APT is currently trading around $4.63–$4.70, reflecting a 3.4% monthly decline. Technical patterns suggest a make-or-break point, with $4.24 and $3.99 acting as key support zones. If Aptos breaks above $5.00, bullish momentum may resume and push prices toward $6.50 or higher. While competition from chains like Celestia and Sui has diluted hype, renewed developer onboarding and capital flows into the Aptos ecosystem suggest a potential reversal. Despite market headwinds, its technology base makes it one of the best crypto coins to buy during consolidation. What distinguishes Solana is its ability to scale without Layer-2 dependencies, thanks to its core validator structure and Sealevel parallel execution engine. Recently, Solana has seen increased support from institutional players. Analysts at Ark Invest and Franklin Templeton have identified Solana as a core asset alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum in future digital portfolios. Solana recently surged to $153.76 and is eyeing a breakout above the psychological $160 resistance level. RSI trends are neutral, but rising volume suggests strong buyer momentum. Solana's volume strength and social sentiment also continue to outpace other Layer-1s in the short term. Why did this coin make it to this list: Solana's unmatched speed and strong institutional backing secure its position as one of the best crypto coins to buy as the market gears up for its next leg. Cosmos is widely regarded as the backbone of multichain Web3. Its Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) allows independent blockchains to communicate and transfer assets without a central intermediary. This is critical in a world where fragmentation threatens blockchain composability. Through Cosmos SDK, developers can build sovereign chains optimized for specific applications. ATOM has climbed 5.57% in the past month, breaking out from a prolonged consolidation. After falling over 54% in six months, Cosmos is now showing signs of sustained upward momentum. Fundamentally, Cosmos is expanding through governance reforms and new developer incentives. The upcoming ATOM 2.0 updates are expected to redefine staking and interchain scheduling, bringing in more efficiency and value capture for the token. As multichain coordination becomes vital, Cosmos remains one of the best crypto coins to buy for forward-looking participants. Each has earned its spot as a front-runner in 2025's digital asset landscape. Qubetics leads the charge by turning real-world assets into liquid, tradable blockchain tokens—and it's doing so with a scarcity-driven presale nearing its final stage. The current $0.3370 entry point offers a rare final window before public launch. Strategic entries today could shape the portfolios of tomorrow. Solana achieves ultra-fast transactions and low fees without relying on Layer-2 chains, using Sealevel for parallel processing. Yes, Qubetics' presale is in Stage 37 with a price of $0.3370 until Sunday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum, on the other hand, is trying to hold above $2,500, while XRP is also holding its ground above $2.10 within the past 24 hours. Some analysts still expect a resumption of bullish momentum once the current range breaks to the upside, but others have taken a more cautious or outright pessimistic stance. One of such bearish outlooks in recent days came from crypto commentator Warren MUPPET, who shared a forecast of a strong downside correction for Bitcoin and other large cryptocurrencies. The broader crypto market appears to be stuck in a consolidation range, with the Fear & Greed Index currently reading 52, which is a neutral sentiment that could easily swing in either direction. Particularly, the crypto commentator recently posted a blunt list of projected price levels that sent waves through some crypto traders. The post, with no charts or technical context, had simply highlighted the price targets for Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Fartcoin, and Hype. These numbers might seem extreme to some, but they are not far-fetched. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP all crahsed to these price levels just two months ago in April. This gives some credibility to the warning and if sentiment turns negative, a drop to these prices may not be out of the picture. Previous price action data suggests that bearish phases often come up swiftly after prolonged consolidation in high zones. If that plays out again, Bitcoin slipping below $100,000 could quickly escalate into a wider marlet price crash. Also, with Ethereum and XRP also consolidating around their respective resistance levels, the chances of a synchronized following Bitcoin crash below $100,000 can't be ruled out. Therefore, the bullish/bearish outlook all depends on if Bitcoin can hold above $100,000. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.
