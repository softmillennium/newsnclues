Two women draped in Palestinian flags used the Peace Palace tram stop sign to take images of tens of thousands of red-clad protesters marched demanding their government do more to halt Israel's campaign in Gaza, during a demonstration in The Hague, Netherlands, Sunday, June 15, 2025. THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Tens of thousands of demonstrators in the Netherlands donned red clothing and marched Sunday to protest the Dutch government's policy toward Israel, exceeding the turnout for a similar event in May. “I don't want to be complicit in these horrendous crimes happening there and I want to speak out,” protester Marin Koning told The Associated Press. Local media put the numbers closer to 100,000. Several rallies have been held to draw attention to Israel's actions in Gaza, but Sunday's was the biggest rally so far. The Dutch protest sent a “clear signal,” according to Marjon Rozema of Amnesty International Netherlands. As during the first Red Line protest in May, the march took the crowds past the Peace Palace, headquarters of the United Nations' International Court of Justice, where last year judges ordered Israel to do all it can to prevent death, destruction and any acts of genocide in Gaza. Israel strongly denies that it is violating international law in Gaza. Hamas started the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, with militants killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking another 251 hostage. The militants still hold 53 hostages, fewer than half of them alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israel's military campaign has killed over 55,300 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It says women and children make up most of the dead but doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel says it has killed more than 20,000 militants, without providing evidence. The meeting, to be held via video link, “will provide an opportunity for an exchange of views, coordination on diplomatic outreach to Tel Aviv and Tehran, and possible next steps.” EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas's office said Sunday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israel's military said “we don't stop striking for one moment.” Iran launched a daytime barrage against Israel for the first time but there have been no reports of significant damage. Visiting the scene of a strike that killed 4 people, Israel's PM Netanyahu said “think what would happen if Iran had atomic weapons.” A stated goal of the Israeli operation is to stop Iran developing a nuclear bomb. Scores are reported killed but no official figure has been given. • No end in sight: Israel's operation against Iran is expected to take “weeks, not days” and is moving forward with implicit US approval, according to White House and Israeli officials. US President Trump said his country “had nothing to do with” the Israeli attacks but later acknowledged that US involvement in the conflict is a possibility. Israel's air force has started a series of strikes on dozens of surface-to-surface missiles in western Iran, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Sunday. “The IAF began a series of strikes on dozens of surface-to-surface missile targets in western Iran,” the IDF's statement read. The strikes between Iran and Israel continued throughout Sunday. The US Embassy in Baghdad issued a security alert on Sunday warning of an increased potential for violence or attacks against Americans in Iraq. The embassy urged US citizens to avoid locations frequented by foreigners and any large gatherings or crowds. The State Department maintains a Level 4 Travel Advisory for Iraq, meaning Americans should not travel to Iraq for any reason. An Iranian foreign ministry building was hit in the Sunday afternoon strikes, videos show, in what would be the second confirmed attack on a government site since the latest violence erupted between Israel and Iran. Footage circulating on social media, and verified by CNN, shows smoke billowing from the library of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, located in northern Tehran. A second video geolocated by CNN shows heavy smoke near the Ministry of Justice, in western Tehran. Several residential areas were hit in the latest Israeli strikes, according to witnesses and state media. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Fox News on Sunday that he launched airstrikes against Iran to prevent “a nuclear holocaust,” claiming his government had intelligence that Iran was months away from developing an initial nuclear weapon. “We had to act,” Netanyahu told Fox's Bret Baier on Sunday. “The intel we got and we shared with the United States was absolutely clear: That they were working in a secret plan to weaponize the uranium, they were marching very quickly, they would achieve a test device and possibly an initial device within months, and certainly less than a year,” he said. Netanyahu also claimed that Israel saw enough enriched uranium for nine bombs. Asked if regime change was among his objectives in Iran, Netanyahu said: “It could certainly be the result, because the Iran regime is very weak.” Netanyahu said “80% of the people would throw these theological thugs out.” Israel's military says it has struck “an Iranian aerial refueling aircraft at Mashhad Airport in eastern Iran,” deep in Iran's northeast, in what it claims is the longest-range strike it has conducted since its operation began. Mashhad International Airport is around 70 miles from Iran's border with Turkmenistan; the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement Sunday it is about  1,430 miles (2,300 kilometers) from Israel. “The IAF is operating to establish aerial superiority over Iranian airspace. President Donald Trump acknowledged that US involvement in the conflict between Israel and Iran is a possibility during a phone interview with ABC News on Sunday. But we are not at this moment involved,” Trump told ABC's Rachel Scott. The next round of US-Iran nuclear negotiations, scheduled to take place in Oman on Sunday, was canceled. But Trump said the Iranians “want to talk, and they will be talking,” adding that the recent escalations “may have forced a deal to go quicker, actually.” Trump also expressed a willingness to consider Russian President Vladimir Putin as a potential mediator in the conflict, noting that Putin had reached out to him. We had a long talk about it,” the president said. Another body was recovered in the city of Bat Yam in central Israel, after an Iranian strike hit a residential building. At least seven people were killed in that strike, according to emergency services and government officials. Iran's president has said the United States “undoubtedly plays a direct role” in Israel's military operation, Fars state media agency reported. The outlet quoted President Masoud Pezeshkian as saying; “[US Special Envoy Steve] Witkoff told [Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas] Araghchi, ‘Israel cannot do anything without our permission' – this means Israel's actions are carried out with direct approval from the United States.” Pezeshkian continued to claim that “what we are witnessing today is being done with Washington's direct backing, even though they try to conceal their role in the media.” The president said that while Iran has never sought war or conflict, any continuation of hostilities would be met with “decisive and severe” retaliation. The administration of US President Donald Trump has not critiqued the weeks-long timeframe in private discussions, an Israeli official told CNN. A White House official said the administration was aware and implicitly supportive of Israel's plans. Israeli foreign minister Gideon Sa'ar has said his government anticipated casualties in the wake of its audacious assault on Iran, but it “didn't have any other choice.” At least 13 people have been confirmed dead in Israel due to Iran's retaliatory strikes, including three minors. The foreign minister said assessments of Iran's nuclear program showed it could have made an atomic bomb “within six months,” reiterating claims that Iran had enough enriched uranium for nine nuclear bombs. When asked whether unseating Iran's regime, led by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is one of Israel's goals in this latest conflict, Sa'ar said: “The goal is not a regime change… This is for the Iranian people to decide, we, Israel… don't see the Iranian people as our enemies.” The foreign minister thanked the United States for their military aid, but added it is up to them as “a sovereign state” to decide whether they would directly assist Israel in eliminating Iran's military facilities. Former US Vice President Mike Pence issued a stark warning during an interview Sunday on CNN's State of the Union with Dana Bash as Israel detected more missile launches from Iran. “Iran will never be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon,” Pence said, when asked by Bash about the ongoing tit-for-tat attacks between the two nations. Pence went on to elaborate on the broader dangers of a nuclear-armed Iran and reiterated a hardline stance against Iran's nuclear ambitions. “Remember, those missiles that Iran has developed over the years can reach Europe, today. I'm grateful for President Trump's strong statements of support for Israel and its action,” Pence said reflecting on his time in office, emphasizing the Trump administration's firm position on Iran's nuclear ambitions. “I want to say emphatically that if the world knows nothing else, the world should know this, America stands with Israel,” Pence said. But the former vice president also offered a warning to both the current administration and his former boss, after Bash pressed him on Trump's recent comments on his call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Vladimir Putin continues his brutal and unprovoked invasion in Ukraine using drones provided by Iran, I would say respectfully to the administration. We ought to be looking elsewhere than Vladimir Putin for advice on how to deal with this situation,” Pence said. The US and Russian presidents held an hourlong phone call on Saturday, Trump confirmed in a social media post, adding that the leaders spoke about Iran and Israel's tit-for-tat airstrikes “at length,” and called for an end to the conflict. More details of this afternoon's Israeli strikes on Tehran are beginning to emerge, with densely populated residential areas of the Iranian capital being targeted, CNN understands. Tajrish is home to a major shopping center, while Valiasr Street is considered one of Tehran's main thoroughfares and commercial centers. Video footage circulating on social media and geolocated by CNN shows smoke billowing into the sky following a strike in a dense area of the city near Valiasr Street. Other images show smoke near Tehran's Ministry of Justice building. Israel's military had previously said it was targeting military and nuclear complexes in Iran, although there are no known such complexes in these areas of the capital. Another furious wave of strikes between Israel and Iran has claimed lives in both countries, with Israel threatening to continue its attacks “for as long as it takes” to wipe out Iran's nuclear threat. “Iran will pay a very heavy price for deliberately murdering our citizens, women and children,” Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday. US President Donald Trump has pledged that Iran and Israel “will make a deal” to pause their conflict, insisting that “many calls and meetings (are) now taking place” to get both sides to halt fighting. “Likewise, we will have PEACE, soon, between Israel and Iran! Many calls and meetings now taking place,” Trump wrote. “I do a lot, and never get credit for anything, but that's OK, the PEOPLE understand. Israeli citizens have been told they can leave their shelters by the Home Front Command, but must remain nearby, after Iran launched its first daytime missile barrage since the latest conflict erupted on Friday. Israel has continued to strike Iran throughout the day on Sunday, with reports of fresh blasts in the capital Tehran. Israel's military has detected more missiles launched from Iran on Sunday, warning citizens across the country stay near shelters. Movement in public areas should be minimized, and public gatherings must be avoided,” the IDF said in a statement. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has again warned of the danger of Tehran having nuclear weapons as he visited the impact site of an Iranian missile strike that killed at least four people. Think of what could happen if Iran had atomic weapons to drop on Israeli cities. Think of what could happen if Iran had 20,000 such missiles,” Netanyahu said in a video message from the city of Bat Yam. “Iran will pay a very heavy price for deliberately murdering our citizens, women and children. They will feel the might of our arm,” he added. The prime minister's visit comes after Israeli President Isaac Herzog attended the impact site to meet emergency responders and residents. State media reported blasts in several residential areas in the west of the city and showed plumes of smoke rising. One video showed a car on fire and the street thick with dust. “We don't stop striking for one moment,” Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Effie Defrin said. “At this time, too, we continue to strike dozens of various additional targets in Tehran.” Israel struck the “nuclear command center of the Iranian regime” in overnight strikes on 80 targets across Iran Saturday, a military spokesperson said, adding: “We are not pausing for a moment.” The new round of strikes on Iran hit “research and development sites used for the production of raw materials and laboratories for the development of nuclear weapons,” Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief Spokesperson Effie Defrin said at a Sunday briefing. “We also struck fuel depots near Tehran that support Iranian military infrastructure,” he said. “Even at this hour, we are continuing to strike dozens more targets in Tehran,” Defrin said. Israel's President Isaac Herzog visited the site of a deadly Iranian missile strike in Bat Yam, Central Israel, on Sunday.</p>

Nancy Mace, R-S.C., and Fatima Goss Graves, the CEO of the Women's Law Center, square off during a DOGE hearing on protecting women's sports. EXCLUSIVE: Two USA Fencing board of directors members are suing the other six at-large director members, alleging chair Damien Lehfeldt made false statements to congress at a May 7 Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) subcommittee hearing on transgender athletes. The lawsuit, which seeks to have Lehfeldt removed as USA Fencing chair, was filed on USA Fencing's behalf by the two plaintiff members. Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-NM) (L) and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) (R) speak about an alleged screenshot from the Instagram of USA Fencing board director Damien Lehfeldt during the hearing on "Unfair Play: Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports" held by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Subcommittee at the U.S. Capitol on May 7, 2025, in Washington, D.C.  (Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images) Now, they are taking the organization to court after alleging Lefheldt falsely announced Geva's resignation from the board at a meeting on June 7, and over several allegations involving the May 7 Doge hearing. The May hearing was called in response to a viral incident where women's fencer Stephanie Turner kneeled to protest a transgender opponent, and was subsequently punished by USA Fencing. "Defendant Lehfeldt's non-corporative demeanor in bad faith and untruthful and misleading statements at the congressional hearing on May 7, [2025] has prompted the Congress to consider decertifying USFA as an NGB, thus potentially risking Team USA's qualification in the 2028 Los Angeles Summer Olympic Game," the lawsuit states. "His lies have alienated thousands of members in the fencing community who have provided more than 90% of USFA's revenues." Geva claims he attempted to speak at the hearing as well, but alleges he faced "threats" aimed to "deter" him from it. Geva ultimately submitted a letter to Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on May 2, expressing "opinion on biological men's advantage over women in fencing." Cruz's office had recently opened an investigation into USA Fencing over its transgender eligibility policy after the Turner incident. The lawsuit alleges Geva was then messaged by a fellow board member, blaming him for his honest personal opinion, and then two board members called for a "special board meeting intended to remove or otherwise discipline Plaintiff Geva." USA Fencing has acknowledged the lawsuit in a statement to Fox News Digital. This derivative lawsuit misrepresents our organization, and we will vigorously defend the organization in court; any attempt to disparage them will be addressed appropriately," the statement read. "Because litigation is ongoing, we cannot discuss details. Our focus remains unwavering: advancing fencing nationwide, supporting every member's success, and upholding the values of the Olympic and Paralympic movement." Lehfeldt, who was subpoenaed and did not come voluntarily, made elevated the controversy ahead of the hearing with a series of Instagram stories that were later blown up and used against him on the committee floor. In one post, which went viral before the hearing, he responded to a question that asked whether he was "okay" with putting female fencers at a disadvantage with a simple, brash answer: "Yeah." Then, during the hearing, Lehfeldt admitted multiple times he regretted answering that way and admitted the question required a "more-nuanced" response. At one point during the hearing, Lefheldt confessed to falsifying an email from a fictitious fencing mother "Dorothy" who disagreed with him and called those members with similar view of "Dorothy" "grand wizard" of Ku Klux Klan. "It was a poor attempt at humor," Lehfeldt said. Rep. Tim Burhcett, R-Tenn., asked Lehfeldt whether he would let his daughter fence against "a man." Lehfeldt suggested he would allow it while boasting about his organization's safety precautions. Later in the hearing, Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., suggested that Lehfeldt was "not" a man for his organization's gender eligibility policy. "Real men protect women, you're not one," Mace said. Mace even asked Lehfeldt to simply apologize to Turner for punishing the fencer, to which the chair declined and pointed out that Turner received a black card for her refusal. Turner told Fox News Digital after the DOGE hearing that she would work to lobby leadership changes to USA Fencing after stepping away from the sport. I'd like to see some people resign for the comments that they've made, especially publicly, ones that are harassing and meant to humiliate concerned women, mothers and daughters," Turner said. Now, two members on the board of directors have joined that cause. Amid the ongoing scrutiny, USA Fencing's board voted to amend its current policy that prioritized states with LGBTQ-friendly laws for host sites for competitions and a policy that may have prevented the playing of the national anthem at some events, at its June 7 meeting. "It would be inappropriate for staff to speculate on the personal motivations of USA Fencing's volunteer Board of Directors," a USA Fencing spokesperson told Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The fatalities come as the two countries have exchanged a barrage of missiles and attacks over the past three days, with the Israel Defense Forces carrying out overnight strikes on 80 targets focused on wiping out Tehran's energy and defense infrastructure on Saturday, with Iran's U.N. ambassador saying 78 Iranians had been killed in Israeli strikes. If we are attacked in any way, shape or form by Iran, the full strength and might of the U.S. Armed Forces will come down on you at levels never seen before. !” the president said in a post to Truth Social. The conflict began Thursday when Israel conducted a wide-ranging attack on Iran's nuclear and military capabilities hours after the United Nations's nuclear watchdog passed a resolution declaring Tehran in noncompliance with its nuclear safeguards obligations for the first time in two decades. The operation killed much of Iran's military command and its leading nuclear scientists, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps's entire air force command. Iran responded by sending a barrage of missiles into Israeli territory, some of which struck a four-story building over the weekend, resulting in four deaths and 24 injuries in the northern district of Israel. Another one of Tehran's strikes hit a residential apartment building in Bat Yam, near Tel Aviv, killing at least six people, including two children. “Iran will pay a very heavy price for deliberately murdering our citizens, women and children. Think of what could happen if Iran had atomic weapons to drop on Israeli cities. Think of what could happen if Iran had 20,000 such missiles,” the Israeli prime minister added. Tehran's strikes led Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz to warn the regime on Saturday that if attacks on Israel, largely in civilian areas, aren't halted, “Tehran will burn.” Israel followed up on the threat with attacks on two of Iran's critical oil production facilities. Trump sought to solve the conflict via diplomatic means and in early April offered Iran 60 days to make a deal or else face “dire consequences.” That deadline came and went unmet on the day before Israel decided to attempt to wipe out Iran's nuclear and military capabilities on its own despite nuclear talks between Iranian and U.S. negotiators being scheduled for Sunday.</p>

Former U.S. men's soccer star Stu Holden tells Fox News Digital what areas of concern the U.S. will address ahead of the 2026 World Cup. Former USMNT player Stu Holden identified one big issue the team needs to figure out before the World Cup begins next year. "I think the biggest issue for the USMNT is to figure out who are the 11 guys who are going to step out on that field on June 12, 2026, that can inspire people and get results. There has not been anything in two years since the World Cup in Qatar that has made me feel that we have taken any strides forward," Holden told Fox News Digital. USA player Stuart Holden (11) chases after the ball with Panama player Roberto Chen (23) during the 2013 Gold Cup championship game at Soldier Field in Chicago, Illinois, on July 28, 2013. "I think that is the goal with developing and the amount of investment we have put into the game in this country is that I haven't seen anything that makes me think we are going to do anything that we haven't done before." "It is about this group of players, not just making us believe, but making themselves believe but making themselves believe by getting some results and building some momentum heading into that moment. However, USMNT's best player, Christian Pulisic, is not playing in the Gold Cup, which Holden said is a big deal. "I think it's a big deal, because I think anytime the United States national team is playing I want the best 23, 11, whatever it is, American players playing on those fields in those moments. And I also want players that are excited to play and represent their national team in every moment," Holden said. Former professional soccer player and Fox Sports Analyst Stuart Holden and his wife Karalyn Holden pose for a photo on the red carpet for the "One Year to Go" for FIFA World Cup 26 event at FOX Studio Lot on June 11, 2025, in Los Angeles, California. "And it is not just a, ‘Eh, maybe I will come in this time.' So, I think that is what we are missing. And when he is on the field, it sets the tone and makes other people want to be a part of it as well. Pulisic will be back with USMNT for the World Cup, but Holden has one player that fans should look out for other than Pulisic. "I think Weston Mckennie is a player that always excites me because he just has some really raw talent. In some of the biggest moments he turns up with a goal," Holden said. "My hope is he's a guy who takes and shoulders some of that responsibility for the World Cup next year and be a guy who can really create some moments. We can't just have one good player, we need to have four to five of our top players playing at their absolute maximum for this team to do something special." Former professional soccer player and Fox Sports Analyst Stuart Holden interviews on the red carpet for the "One Year to Go" for FIFA World Cup 26 event at FOX Studio Lot on June 11, 2025, in Los Angeles, California. "I am excited, as a guy who lives in L.A. now and has for ten years, for people to come and visit L.A. and see the soccer culture that we built here. "The other part I am excited for is, I have two young kids, and I can't wait to take them to games in our own backyard, and let them see the best players, the biggest teams, and experience that, because that is how we inspire the next generation of people. So, I am excited about those fans that will be inspired to be a part of our game going forward." Fox News' Connor McGahan contributed to this report.

Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy reports on how President Donald Trump believes that the Los Angeles rioters are being ‘paid' to protest on ‘Special Report.' The anti-ICE protests and riots in Los Angeles brought heightened scrutiny on activist groups, including the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, the Party for Socialism and Liberation, and Union del Barrio. CHIRLA and the other groups are now subject to an investigation by Sen. Josh Hawley, R-MO., through the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism, and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said that the Internal Revenue Service is looking into any possible funding of "violent" acts, according to CBS News. Hawley sent letters to the groups for an "alleged role in financing and materially supporting the coordinated protests and riots that have gulfed Los Angeles." "Credible reporting now suggests that your organization has provided logistical support and financial resources to individuals engaged in these disruptive actions," Hawley wrote in the letters. "Let me be clear: bankrolling civil unrest is not protected speech. CHIRLA Executive Director Angelica Salas condemned the ICE sweeps in Los Angeles during a news conference with Mayor Karen Bass on Thursday, adding that Republicans are "saying the most vicious lies of who we are, what we do and what we're about." "And yes, we have received a letter from Sen. Josh Hawley. But what I want you to know is that's not going to deter us, it's not going to intimidate us from standing with our immigrant community," Salas said. CHIRLA said they have not played a role in the violence, according to the New York Post earlier this week. Some parts of the city faced property damage, including vehicles and businesses. A protester places debris in a fire as Border Patrol personnel in riot gear and gas masks stand guard outside an industrial park in Paramount, Calif., on Saturday, June 7, 2025. "Yesterday, our raids rapid response network did not stop receiving calls until after 7 p.m.," Salas said. It's the community is also very scared. CHIRLA operates a "deportation defense" legal team, along with other immigration resources, according to its website. U.S. National Guard are deployed around downtown Los Angeles, Sunday, June 8, 2025, following an immigration raid protest the night before. President Donald Trump has claimed "paid insurrections" have played a role in the riots, as a legal battle plays out between him and the state of California for his National Guard troop deployment to the civil unrest. Fox News Digital reached out to CHIRLA for further comment. The FBI told Fox News Digital earlier this week that if any evidence of a criminal conspiracy emerges, they will look into it. "We're investigating anyone who crosses the line from first-amendment protected activity to violence and are prepared to prosecute anyone who assaults a federal officer or causes damage to government property," Laura Eimiller, media coordinator for the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office, told Fox News Digital in an email at the time. "LAPD, as you know, is also making arrests for unlawful assembly. Obviously, any evidence of a criminal conspiracy will be investigated."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The more than 1,000-page legislation, which touches on everything from Medicaid and taxes to artificial intelligence, food stamps, and gun suppressors, has Democrats scrambling to turn the public against a smorgasbord of policies they hope might derail delicate negotiations among Republicans. Democrats are on a public relations blitz of near-daily press events to cycle through provisions tucked into the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the backbone of Trump's domestic policy agenda. In the last week, Senate Democrats hosted press conferences on the bill's repeal of former President Joe Biden's clean energy tax credits, extension of Trump's first-term tax cuts that expire this year, crackdown on illegal immigration enforcement, policy effects on women, Medicaid cuts, and tax cuts for firearm suppressors. Some issues, such as Medicaid, were the subject of more than one event. “There's so many items in this 1,000-page bill,” Durbin told the Washington Examiner. “Those three things, I think, are the top visible issues. “Hospitals will close if Republicans are successful in passing the GOP tax scam,” Jeffries told reporters, referencing proposed changes to provider tax credits that hospitals receive for Medicaid patients. Changes to Medicaid benefits and new work requirements will mean higher healthcare costs and less eligibility, creating a flash point in the broader debate over the bill. Democrats see the government-run healthcare program for lower-income Americans as a pillar of their messaging strategy, along with opposing the extension of tax cuts that are projected to benefit wealthier earners. While Democrats have been unsuccessful in derailing Republicans so far, there's evidence they could be chipping away at the overall proposal's popularity, particularly Medicaid. A Quinnipiac University survey this week showed that 53% of voters oppose the legislation. Less than a third support it, and 20% have no opinion. Medicaid is overwhelmingly popular, with 87% opposing cuts, including 77% of Republicans. Medicaid is a point of major friction for Republicans in states with high Medicaid enrollment and who oppose changes that would essentially cut benefits or jeopardize hospital funding. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), the program's loudest conservative defender, vowed Friday to remain “in hourly contact with leadership” until changes are made. Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) used a rare joint press conference to offer a tongue-in-cheek “second chance” to House Republicans, urging them to demand changes for items they were previously unaware of but now align with Democrats in opposing them. Schumer cited the bill's repeal of green energy tax credits as a leading example.</p>

Police in Los Angeles, where protests over federal immigration enforcement raids erupted a week earlier and sparked demonstrations across the country, used tear gas and crowd-control munitions to clear out protesters on Saturday.

(AP Photo/Jenny Kane) PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Masses of demonstrators packed into streets, parks and plazas across the United States on Saturday to protest President Donald Trump, marching through downtowns and small towns, blaring anti-authoritarian chants mixed with support for protecting democracy and immigrant rights. Governors across the U.S. had urged calm and vowed no tolerance for violence, while some mobilized the National Guard ahead of marchers gathering. Demonstrators standoff against law enforcement on horseback during a protest Saturday, June 14, 2025, in Los Angeles. But police in Los Angeles, where protests over federal immigration enforcement raids erupted a week earlier and sparked demonstrations across the country, used tear gas and crowd-control munitions to clear out protesters after the formal event ended. Officers in Portland also fired tear gas and projectiles to disperse a crowd that protested in front of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building well into the evening. And in Salt Lake City, Utah, police were investigating a shooting during a march downtown that left one person critically injured. Three people were taken into custody, including a man believed to be the shooter, who also suffered a gunshot wound, according to Police Chief Brian Redd. Redd said it was too early to tell if the shooting was politically motivated and whether those involved knew each other. Video feeds showed demonstrators running for safety as gunshots rang out. Huge, boisterous crowds marched, danced, drummed, and chanted shoulder-to-shoulder in New York, Denver, Chicago, Austin and Los Angeles, some behind “no kings” banners. Atlanta's 5,000-capacity event quickly reached its limit, with thousands more gathered outside barriers to hear speakers in front of the state Capitol. Demonstrators dressed in Revolutionary War era clothing march down Benjamin Franklin Parkway during the “No Kings” protest, Saturday, June 14, 2025, in Philadelphia. Mexican flags, which have become a fixture of the Los Angeles protests against immigration raids, also made an appearance at some demonstrations Saturday. In Culpepper, Virginia, police said one person was struck by an SUV when a 21-year-old driver intentionally accelerated his SUV into the crowd as protesters were leaving a rally. “Today, across red states and blue, rural towns and major cities, Americans stood in peaceful unity and made it clear: we don't do kings,” the No Kings Coalition said in a statement Saturday afternoon after many events had ended. Demonstrators march during the “No Kings” protest, Saturday, June 14, 2025, in Philadelphia. Thousands gathered downtown, where organizers handed out small American flags and people carried protest signs saying “fight oligarchy” and “deport the mini-Mussolinis.” Karen Van Trieste, a 61-year-old nurse who drove up from Maryland, said she grew up in Philadelphia and wanted to be with a large group of people showing her support. “I just feel like we need to defend our democracy,” she said. She is concerned about the Trump administration's layoffs of staff at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the fate of immigrant communities and Trump trying to rule by executive order, she said. ”I am what the successful American dream looks like,” said C.C. Téllez, an immigrant from Bolivia who attended the protest. Thousands gathered in front of City Hall, waving signs and listening to a Native American drum circle before marching through the streets. As protesters passed National Guard troops or U.S. Marines stationed at various buildings, most interactions were friendly, with demonstrators giving fist bumps or posing for selfies. But others chanted “shame” or “go home” at the troops. Amid signs reading “They fear us don't back down California” and “We carry dreams not danger, ” one demonstrator carried a 2-foot-tall (60-centimeter) Trump pinata on a stick, with a crown on his head and sombrero hanging off his back. Another hoisted a huge helium-filled orange baby balloon with blond hair styled like Trump's. A few blocks from City Hall, protesters gathered in front of the downtown federal detention center being guarded by a line of Marines and other law enforcement. It was the first time that the Marines, in combat gear and holding rifles, have appeared at a demonstration since they were deployed to city on Friday with the stated mission of defending federal property. “I voted for Donald Trump, and now I regret that, because he's taken this fascism to a new level,” Varadi said. Even after the formal event ended, the downtown streets were packed with a jubilant crowd as people danced to salsa music and snacked on hot dogs and ice cream bought from vendors, many of whom are Latino immigrants. Marchers in the crowd that stretched for blocks along Fifth Avenue had diverse reasons for coming, including anger over Trump's immigration policies, support for the Palestinian people and outrage over what they said was an erosion of free speech rights. Leah Griswold, 32, and Amber Laree, 59, who marched in suffragette white dresses, brought 250 American flags to hand out to people in the crowd. Some protesters held signs denouncing Trump while others banged drums. “We're here because we're worried about the existential crisis of this country and the planet and our species,” said Sean Kryston, 28. Dozens of events were canceled, but tens of thousands still turned out for demonstrations in Duluth, Rochester and St. Paul, which included a march to the state Capitol. Walz canceled his scheduled appearance at the St. Paul event. Authorities said the suspect had “No Kings” flyers in his car and writings mentioning the names of the victims as well as other lawmakers and officials, though they could not say if he had any other specific targets. Crowds cheered anti-Trump speakers in Charlotte's First Ward Park before marching, chanting “No kings. Marchers stretched for blocks, led by a group of people holding a giant Mexican flag and bystanders cheering and clapping along the way. Jocelyn Abarca, a 21-year-old college student, said the protest was a chance to “speak for what's right” after mass deportations and Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles. A rally at the Texas Capitol in Austin went off as planned despite state police briefly shutting down the building and the surrounding grounds after authorities said they received a “credible threat” to Democratic state lawmakers who were to attend. The Department of Public Safety later said one person was taken into custody “in connection with the threats made against state lawmakers” after a traffic stop in La Grange, Texas, about 65 miles (105 kilometers) east of Austin. A demonstration of hundreds of people opened to “War Pigs” by Black Sabbath playing over a sound system on the state Capitol lawn in Jackson. “A lot of stuff that's going on now is targeting people of color, and to see so many folks out here that aren't black or brown fighting for the same causes that I'm here for, it makes me very emotional,” said Tony Cropper, who traveled from Tennessee to attend the protest. Others held signs inviting motorists to “Honk if you never text war plans.” Melissa Johnson said she drove an hour-and-a-half to Jackson to protest because “we are losing the thread of democracy in our country.” By late afternoon, a small group of demonstrators amassed across the river to protest in front of an ICE office where three people were arrested Wednesday night after starting a small fire against the building, police said.

(AP Photo/Jenny Kane) Federal immigration officers fired tear gas, flash bangs and rubber bullets in an effort to clear out the remaining protesters in the evening. Some protesters threw water bottles back and tended to each other's wounds. At least two people were detained and taken inside the federal immigration building.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The grand military parade that President Donald Trump had been wanting for years barreled down Constitution Avenue on Saturday with tanks, troops and a 21-gun salute, playing out against a counterpoint of protests around the country by those who decried the U.S. leader as a dictator and would-be king. The procession, with more than 6,000 soldiers and 128 Army tanks, was one Trump tried to make happen in his first term after seeing such an event in Paris in 2017, but the plans never came together until the parade was added to an event recognizing the Army's 250th anniversary. It's about time America did too,” Trump declared in brief remarks at the parade's end. The president praised the strength of the military's fighting forces and said U.S. soldiers “fight, fight fight and they win, win win” — putting a new twist on a line that Trump regularly delivered during his 2024 campaign rallies after he survived an assassination attempt. At times, Trump stood and saluted as troops marched past the reviewing stand. But attendance appeared to fall far short of early predictions that as many as 200,000 people would attend the festival and parade. There were large gaps between viewers near the Washington Monument on a day when steamy weather and the threat of thunderstorms could have dampened turnout. The daylong display of America's Army came as Trump has shown his willingness to use the nation's military might in ways other U.S. presidents have typically avoided. Dozens of Marines stood shoulder to shoulder in full combat gear beside the National Guard, Homeland Security officers and other law enforcement. Hundreds of protesters facing them jeered in English and Spanish, telling the troops to go home. A previously calm demonstration in downtown Los Angeles turned chaotic when police on horseback charged at the crowd, striking some with rods and batons as they cleared the street in front of the federal building and fired tear gas and crowd control projectiles. In Washington, hundreds protesting Trump carried signs with messages that included “Where's the due process?” and “No to Trump's fascist military parade” as they marched toward the White House. Other protesters waved pride flags and hoisted signs, some with pointed messages such as “I prefer crushed ICE,” referring to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Other messages included “The invasion was HERE Jan. 6th, NOT in L.A.” and “Flip me off if you're a FASCIST.” “No Kings” rallies unfolded in hundreds of cities, designed to counter what organizers said were Trump's plans to feed his ego on his 79th birthday and Flag Day. Meanwhile, on the National Mall, a display of armored vehicles, helicopters and military-grade equipment was set up to commemorate the Army's birthday. Larry Stallard, a retired American Airlines pilot, said he traveled to Washington from Kansas City for the weekend “to see the military and see Trump.” Stallard, who voted for Trump, said it was “hard to believe” people were upset about the cost of the event when “they blow that in 10 seconds on things that we don't even need.” Pointing at a nearby tank, Haynes said that having them roll down the street is a “very bold statement to the world, perhaps.” About 6 in 10 Americans said Saturday's parade was “not a good use” of government money. Kathy Straus traveled from Richmond, Virginia, to attend the parade, carrying a sign criticizing its cost and arguing the money could have been used to feed veterans. The parade wound down Constitution Avenue, lined with security fencing and barriers. Mounted soldiers from the 1st Cavalry Division made an appearance — horses once played a crucial role in warfare, but today they're mostly used in ceremonial events like today's parade. And have a great life,” Trump said to them afterward. The event was capped off by a fireworks show. It appeared that plans to have U.S. Air Force fighter jets fly over were scrapped because of the weather. Associated Press writers Eric Tucker, Michelle L.

A massive military parade to celebrate the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary, requested by President Donald Trump, rolled through Washington D.C. on Saturday, as opponents of the president's agenda rallied in hundreds of cities nationwide for “No Kings” protests. A line of sheriff's deputies made a push toward the demonstrators who remain in front of Los Angeles city hall Saturday afternoon, continuously firing less lethal munitions. Some protesters refused to leave, sitting down and yelling back “peaceful protest.” A previously calm demonstration in downtown Los Angeles turned chaotic as police on horseback charged at the crowd, striking some with wood rods and batons as they cleared the street in front of the federal building.

Dozens of police officers stood nearby as protesters and festivalgoers yelled at each other. People leaving the Army rally walked past protesters, and the occasional “USA” chant broke out, but no confrontations were seen. There have been several bursts of fireworks above the crowd that had gathered for Saturday's events, with several songs with patriotic undertones playing alongside. There have also been videos with military members giving testimonials about what their service means to them.

There have been troop formations, heavy artillery displays, flyovers, musical performances and a presidential address. But now the Army's birthday parade is drawing to a close. Officers fired more tear gas at protesters, surprising those who had gathered on the street and sidewalk a few blocks from a police line. The clouds of gas wafted toward a family-friendly demonstration that has been going for hours outside City Hall. “We just wanted to come and support our people and we're getting tear gassed for it,” said Melissa Bran, a 28-year-old pharmacist, as she dabbed her red eyes with a wet cloth. Clad in a blue and white sport coat, tie and dark pants, Greenwood performed the song he's sung at Trump's political rallies across the country. “God bless the United States Army,” Greenwood said, wrapping up.

Trump rattled off anecdotes from old wars and stuck to script but did sneak in a vintage Trumpism as he boasted of the attention the United States has garnered. "Trump has been talking up the strength of the U.S. fighting force, saying that enemies that have challenged it have regretted doing so. Adding that “the U.S. Army has driven bayonets into the hearts of evil empires,” Trump also said U.S. soldiers “fight, fight fight and they win, win win” — a reprise of a line regularly delivered during his 2024 campaign rallies It's about time America did too,” Trump said.

There were also new enlistees just going through Army initial entry training, cadets from the Virginia Military Institute and cadets from The Citadel in South Carolina. The final participants include 250 brand new recruits or soldiers who are re-enlisting. Standing at a podium, Trump then swore them into service, with soldiers repeating an oath after him. Tensions were escalating on the streets of downtown Los Angeles as police sought to disperse demonstrators, many of whom seemed caught off guard — and enlivened — by the abrupt orders to leave. As police fired flash bangs and canisters of tear gas, protesters responded with loud fireworks and calls to “hold the line.” Volunteer medics in gas masks roamed the crowd, offering saline solution to those affected by tear gas.

Among those are some tightly connected to Trump. They include the cryptocurrency firm Coinbase, which added Trump's campaign manager to its advisory council. The technology firm Palantir was founded by billionaire Peter Thiel, who used to employ Vice President JD Vance. Traditional military contractors like Amazon and Lockheed Martin also sponsored the event. A few hours after the scheduled march and speeches in Philadelphia had ended, a contingent of police officers on bicycles was monitoring and trying to disperse dozens of protesters who were still gathered in one area, and at least three people had been detained. Protestors confront police officers during a protest, Saturday, June 14, 2025, in Philadelphia. The small crowd — some of them wearing masks or other partial face coverings — chanted phrases like “Say it loud, say it clear, immigrants are welcome here” and “Free Palestine,” and some shouted at the officers. It had been anticipated that there would be dozens of helicopters flying overhead during portions of the parade dedicated to the Gulf War and global war on terror, but that didn't happen. Low visibility and lots of clouds in the Washington area seem to have contributed to less of an aircraft presence in the parade. Some Vietnam-era helicopters were part of an earlier portion. A DPS spokesperson said the person was arrested after a traffic stop in La Grange, about 65 miles (104 kilometers) east of Austin.

Organizers had anticipated the parade in total would last about 90 minutes. That includes scores of Black Hawk helicopters, all variants of towed and self-propelled artillery, and even the HIMARS High Mobility Artillery Rocket System that has been so coveted by Ukraine as it fights Russia. This segment is memorializing the most recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Trump has been critical of the U.S. involvement in those wars. While the World Trade Center towers were still smoldering, soldiers from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment “Night Stalkers” were packing up to launch Green Berets into a classified counterstrike in Afghanistan. That counterstrike inserted the special forces to ride on horseback alongside Northern Alliance fighters to attack the Taliban and take Mazar-e-Sharif.

She added that people haven't been rude, even the ones who disagree with her. The parade is showcasing a variety of artillery pieces and armored vehicles. Helmeted soldiers riding atop vehicles are smiling and waving to the crowd. Dozens of Marines stood shoulder-to-shoulder in full combat gear, hands on their rifles, beside other law enforcement, including Department of Homeland Security officers and the National Guard. Directly in front of them, hundreds of protesters jeered in English and Spanish, telling the federal troops to go home. The event got started well ahead of schedule, and it's speeding right along, as ominous weather is still predicted for the Washington region. In its first 40 minutes, the parade sped through more than 200 years of U.S. Army history, from its inception in 1775 to 1991's Gulf War era. Compared with anticipated timelines laid out in advance, the parade's timing is now nearly half an hour ahead of schedule.

There are bipartisan concerns about the cost of the spectacle, which this civilian commander in chief has pitched as a way to celebrate U.S. power. But with just 6,600-plus troops marching, it's hardly the biggest to be held in America. That show of force in 1865, meant to salve a war-weary nation, included 145,000 soldiers marching down Pennsylvania Avenue. Units representing the Korean War are now being showcased.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Your defeat will be certain, your demise will be final, and your downfall will be total and complete,“ Trump said Saturday, offering a stark message amid a time of conflict across the globe. The president was welcomed to his parade stand with pomp, circumstance and an impromptu birthday celebration. He arrived to a 21-gun salute — and as the cannons fired, members of the crowd began singing “Happy Birthday to You.” live updates Trump presides over military parade as protests take place across US The parade featured several million pounds of military hardware, including dozens of M1-A1 Abrams tanks and Bradley and Stryker fighting vehicles rolling through the streets of DC, as well as Howitzers and other artillery pieces. Nearly 7,000 soldiers were set to participate in the largest military parade the city has seen in decades, which officials have estimated could cost up to $45 million. The eras of Army history were represented with vintage uniforms and equipment. But it was scrapped at the time amid concerns about the price tag and optics of such a display of power. Trump vowed a patriotic show unlike anything seen before and said it would take place regardless of the stormy weather expected in the nation's capital. The parade ran ahead of schedule and a few events, such as an F-22 flyover, appeared to be canceled because of the weather. More than 2,000 protests across all 50 states were planned through the movement, which seeks to reject “authoritarianism, billionaire-first politics, and the militarization of our democracy.” Although the “No Kings” organizers deliberately did not hold protests in DC to avoid drawing attention to the parade, some demonstrators rallied in the nation's capital, holding signs with phrases such as “No Fascist USA” and “No Kings.” Trump federalized 4,000 members of the California National Guard against Gov. Gavin Newsom's will, with orders to protect federal buildings and personnel amid immigration protests in Los Angeles. Some states sought to get ahead of Saturday protests by deploying their state's National Guard. Greg Abbott deployed his state's this week ahead of planned protests, including a No Kings event in San Antonio on Saturday. Mike Kehoe activated Missouri's National Guard on Thursday “as a precautionary measure in reaction to recent instances of civil unrest across the country.”</p>
