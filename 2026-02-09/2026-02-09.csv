            Austrian snowboarder Benjamin Karl knew exactly what he would do if he won a gold medal at this year's Winter Olympics; what he hadn't planned for was the reaction from the rest of the world.
    


            After retaining his parallel giant slalom crown in Livigno on Sunday, the 40-year-old celebrated by ripping off his top, baring his chest to the frenzied crowd, before flexing his muscles and dropping facedown on the snow.
    


            The impassioned celebration was quickly clipped and shared across social media, with thousands enjoying what initially looked like a release of unbridled, unrehearsed joy.
    


            And while Karl was absolutely over-the-moon with his gold medal moment, the reaction was very much planned as a tribute to his hero, Hermann Maier.
    


            The skiing legend was one of the reasons that Karl got into the sport, and he would often celebrate his victories by ripping off his top.
    


            “It was 25 years in my mind when I saw Hermann Maier in 2001 ripping off his shirt after winning the overall World Cup,” Karl told CNN Sports on Monday.
    


            “He was my one and only idol and I waited my whole career for the right moment to do it, in tribute to him.”
    


            Karl can now call himself a four-time Olympic medalist, having already won gold in the same event back in 2022 and silver in his Olympic debut in 2010 at Vancouver. He also claimed a bronze medal in the parallel slalom at Sochi 2014.
    


            After his latest win, in his fifth Games, he became the oldest Olympic snowboard medalist ever and Austria's oldest winter medalist in any sport.
    


            Out of all his medals, though, the first gold in Beijing stands out as the most special, allowing him to have fun in Milan Cortina.
    


            “The first medal is always super, super special,” Karl said. “When I was 10, I was writing on a sheet my goals for life. I wanted to be the fastest snowboarder on Earth, a world champion and an Olympic champion, and when you reach that goal for the first time, it's always the best moment.
    


            “But for my legacy, this second gold medal is really important, not that I had that in my mind. I just had so much fun. It was just a fun day out, carving down the mountain, through gates. It was a perfect day.”
    


            Karl said he let himself enjoy his gold medal win for a brief moment on Sunday, but assured CNN Sports that he was in bed by midnight and already focusing on the remaining World Cup season.
    


            The Austrian credits his love for snowboarding to his mother, who he said got him into the world of winter sports. But while snowboarding became his life, his first love was skiing, with Karl saying he could ski before he could even talk.
    


            But after he found snowboarding at 10,  the goal of becoming an Olympian was set.
    


            “Olympics are, for sure, the greatest event for any sportsman,” he said.
    


            “We have one chance every four years, one day in four years, you're not allowed to be ill or injured. You have to be ready on this day.
    


            “That I made four medals in six chances in my Olympic life, six days out of a 20-year career, it's just amazing.”

Live Updates


• Epstein files: Ghislaine Maxwell, jailed for 20 years for conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to abuse minors, sent a clear message to Donald Trump today that if the president were to grant her clemency, she would clear his name of any wrongdoing as it pertains to Epstein. Separately, members of Congress can review unredacted versions of the Epstein files at the Department of Justice today.
    


• DHS funding: Lawmakers are returning to Washington with just days to find a funding solution on the Department of Homeland Security or see an agency shutdown. Democrats are demanding reforms to federal immigration enforcement.
    


• Super Bowl reaction: Trump — who skipped the Super Bowl and attended a watch party in Florida — called last night's Bad Bunny's halftime performance “a slap in the face” and claimed “nobody understands a word” said by the Puerto Rican music star.
    


            The deadline for funding the Department of Homeland Security is Friday at midnight, but Republican and Democratic negotiators have yet to make significant progress, sources tell CNN.
    


            The lack of serious progress over the weekend raises the stakes that funding for the department could lapse in just a matter of days as Democrats have sought to make major reforms to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection practices as part of these talks.
    


            Democrats sent some legislative text to Republicans over the weekend that crystalized their list of demands, a source briefed on the matter told CNN. Yet, there hasn't been a sustained back-and-forth. One source characterized it as a car stuck in neutral but sort of rolling down a hill – so not totally stalled out.
    


            Last week, Democrats and Republicans were engaged in a public fight over who was stalling the talks, a sign that the negotiations aren't yet at a serious point.
    


            It's possible that Senate Majority Leader John Thune may need to begin the process of filing cloture on another short-term funding stopgap, known as a continuing resolution, but again, it's not clear that Democrats would back that plan barring significant progress on Republicans meeting their demands on ICE reforms.
    


            The fallout from the release by the Department of Justice of millions of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein continued unabated today, here and abroad.
    


            His jailed associate Ghislaine Maxwell invoked the Fifth Amendment during a virtual deposition as her attorney made an extraordinary overture. She is currently serving time at a minimum security prison in Bryan, Texas.

CNN's MJ Lee, Annie Grayer, James Frater, Caitin Danaher and Billy Stockwell contributed to this report.



            Vice President JD Vance on Monday became the first sitting US vice president (or president) to visit Armenia, where he touted partnerships between the two nations — including US drone technology sales and a civil nuclear cooperation agreement.
    


            “Tonight marks a new beginning for Armenia and the United States and the partnership that our country can have together,” Vance said, standing beside Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, whom he endorsed ahead of upcoming elections.
    


            Vance credited President Donald Trump and Pashinyan for advancing a forward-looking vision for peace in the region. Trump hosted the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan at the White House in August, where they finalized a peace agreement that would grant the US exclusive development access to a critical transit corridor in the South Caucasus.
    


            Vance praised that Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity, saying it'll ensure “private capital is going to flow into building railroads, into building pipelines, again, to building the interconnectedness that would create real prosperity for the region, but also allow the peace agreement to stick.”
    


            Pashinyan, for his part, said he hopes Trump will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2026 and discussed his role on the Board of Peace, confirming he plans to attend an upcoming meeting.
    


            Ghislaine Maxwell, who was sentenced to prison for 20 years for conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to abuse minors, sent a clear message to Donald Trump on Monday that if the president were to grant her clemency, she would clear his name of any wrongdoing as it pertains to Epstein.
    


            The extraordinary overture, stated by Maxwell's lawyer Monday morning during her virtual deposition before the House Oversight Committee, ensures the Epstein saga will continue to remain a political hotspot.
    


                    “Ms. Maxwell is prepared to speak fully and honestly if granted clemency by President Trump,” attorney David Oscar Markus said in a statement during the deposition, which he later posted on X. “Only she can provide the complete account. Some may not like what they hear, but the truth matters. For example, both President Trump and President Clinton are innocent of any wrongdoing.”
                





            Markus also said that: “Ms. Maxwell alone can explain why, and the public is entitled to that explanation.”
    


            Trump has not ruled out the possibility of offering Maxwell a pardon or commutation.
    


            Trump and Clinton, who appear throughout the files released by DOJ, have denied any wrongdoing related to Epstein.
    


            House Oversight Chair James Comer called Maxwell's decision to plead the Fifth “very disappointing” and said lawmakers “had many questions to ask about the crime she and Epstein committed, as well as questions about potential co-conspiracy.”
    


            Democrats on the committee accused Maxwell of trying to buy her clemency by refusing to testify. “We will not allow this silence to stand,” Democratic Rep. Melanie Stansbury said.
    


            When asked if he would subpoena Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick as part of the probe, Comer said he was going to focus on five depositions he has coming up.
    


            The Clintons are expected to appear behind closed doors later this month for depositions.
    


            Jeffrey Epstein survivors urged members of the House Oversight Committee to treat Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell's testimony “with the utmost skepticism” before she appeared for a virtual deposition with the panel, according to a letter shared with CNN.
    


            Maxwell invoked her Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination during her brief appearance today, according to a person familiar with the matter. The survivors' letter was entered into evidence during the virtual deposition.
    


                    “We urge the Committee to approach Ms. Maxwell's testimony with the utmost skepticism, to rigorously scrutinize any claims she makes, and to ensure that this process does not become another vehicle through which survivors are harmed or silenced,” according to the letter, signed by a group of survivors, including multiple Jane Does and family members of Virginia Giuffre. “Truth, accountability, and transparency must be the priority—not the rehabilitation of a convicted trafficker's narrative.”
                





            The group writes that many of them were “harmed” by Maxwell over the course of decades, and that they worry her deposition is “becoming another opportunity for deception rather than truth.” They accused her of repeatedly lying under oath and declining to identify powerful men who were involved in Epstein's sex trafficking operation.
    


                    “Ms. Maxwell was not a peripheral figure. She was a central and indispensable architect of Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking enterprise,” they wrote. “Despite this, she has refused to meaningfully cooperate with law enforcement or provide credible, complete information about the scope of the trafficking network.”
                





            CNN has asked Maxwell's lawyer for comment.
    


            Ghislaine Maxwell has invoked her Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination in her ongoing deposition with the House Oversight Committee, according to a person familiar with the matter.
    


            Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's accomplice, is appearing before the panel virtually. She is currently serving time at a minimum security prison in Bryan, Texas.
    


            During the deposition, Maxwell appeared to be wearing a khaki-colored short-sleeve button-up shirt and was wearing glasses. Her lawyer Leah Saffian sat next to her at a table and had a laptop.

            A possible Department of Homeland Security shutdown by the end of the week hinges on a showdown over a DHS funding bill — with Democrats looking to impose limits on ICE agents after the killing of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, and Republicans refusing their key demands.
    


            Last week, Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters that efforts to find agreement over the Department of Homeland Security funding bill would “continue through the weekend.”
    


            While Thune said he preferred a full-year funding extension as a backup, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries yesterday said he was not willing to accept anything less than Democratic leaders' demands.
    


Jeffries cast blame on Republicans for stalled negotiations on a deal to fund DHS, which includes FEMA and TSA, ahead of the February 13 deadline.
    


            Democrats have put forward their list of requirements for a bill to fund DHS and reform ICE, including requiring immigration enforcement agents to wear body cameras and remove face masks and to use judicial warrants, an issue that has been a nonstarter for Republicans.
    


            Jeffries said Democrats haden't heard back from the White House or GOP leaders on their “common sense” demands, adding, “in our view, the ball is in the court right now of the Republicans.”
    


                    “Either they're going to agree to dramatically reform the way in which ICE and other immigration enforcement agencies are conducting themselves, so that they're behaving like every other law enforcement agency in the country, or they're making the explicit decision to shut down the Coast Guard, shut down FEMA and shut down TSA,” he warned.
                





CNN's Stephen Collinson and Alison Main contributed to this reporting.



            President Donald Trump arrived back at the White House after midnight, after attending a Super Bowl watch party in Florida last night.
    


            This is what's listed on Trump's schedule for today:
    


            We'll keep you updated if anything changes.
    


            Several victims of Jeffrey Epstein appeared in an ad released yesterday that demands more transparency from the government as it continues to post documents related to the late sex offender.
    


            The video, released by the group World Without Exploitation, features women sharing pictures of themselves when they were younger. They call on Attorney General Pam Bondi to release all files pertaining to various investigations into Epstein.
    


            The ad comes as the Department of Justice continues to face scrutiny about what it has released as well as what has been redacted in the files.
    


            Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer described the video in a social media post as “the most important ad you will see on Super Bowl Sunday.”
    


                    “You don't ‘move on' from the largest sex trafficking ring in the world,” the senator wrote. “You expose it.”
                





            Jeffrey Epstein's accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell is set to appear for a closed-door deposition on Capitol Hill today, while the Prince and Princess of Wales are speaking out about Epstein as the scandal has engulfed the palace and UK parliament in recent weeks.
    


Maxwell deposition: Maxwell, who convicted of the sex trafficking of a minor and other charges in 2021, will appear before the House Oversight Committee this morning. It is important to note however, that committee chair James Comer expects she will assert her Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination and not actually testify.
    


In the UK: Meanwhile, Prince and Princess of Wales have been “deeply concerned” by revelations from the trove of new documents related to Epstein, a Kensington Palace spokesperson told journalists in Riyadh ahead of Prince William's visit to Saudi Arabia today. “Their thoughts remain focused on the victims.”
    


            The chief of staff to Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Morgan McSweeney, resigned yesterday over the scandal around the appointment of Peter Mandelson — who has been linked to Epstein — as UK ambassador to the US.
    


Back in the US: GOP Rep. Thomas Massie is calling for Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to resign. Asked on CNN's “Inside Politics” if Lutnick, who appeared to have corresponded with Epstein multiple times, should testify, the Kentucky lawmaker responded, “No, he should just resign.”
    


            Documents revealed that Lutnick sought to meet with or call Epstein several times since 2005, including after Epstein pleaded guilty to procuring a minor for prostitution in 2008.
    


            And yesterday, several victims of Jeffrey Epstein appeared in an ad that demanded more transparency from the government as it continues to post documents related to the late sex offender. The ad demands that Attorney General Pam Bondi release all files pertaining to various investigations into Epstein, who died in 2019.
    


CNN's Max Foster, Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Annie Grayer, and Micheal Williams contributed to this reporting.



            In an exclusive interview with CNN's Manu Raju, Kentucky Congressman Thomas Massie says it's time for Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to resign following the latest release of the Jeffrey Epstein files.
    


            Here's a round-up of our reporting on the Trump administration's latest foreign policy developments.
    


            Talks between Greenland and the United States are not currently where Greenland would like them to be — and it is too early to say what the outcome will be, the Arctic island's foreign minister said yesterday.
    


            On January 21, Trump announced he had reached a “framework of a future deal” regarding Greenland. The talks between the US, Greenland and Denmark are aimed at finalizing that deal.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “is expected” to visit Washington to meet with Trump on Wednesday, “where he will discuss with him the negotiations with Iran,” the Prime Minister's office said Saturday.
    


                    “The Prime Minister believes that any negotiations must include limitations on ballistic missiles and an end to support for the Iranian axis,” the statement concluded.
                





            Yesterday, Iran's foreign minister said the country must uphold its right to continue uranium enrichment, after initial indirect talks with the United States over the country's nuclear progam.
    


            A key point of contention remains Iran's demand to enrich uranium – a nuclear fuel that can be used to make a bomb if purified to high levels – which the US and its allies reject.
    


CNN's Sophie Tanno, Isabelle D'Antonio, Eugenia Yosef, Max Saltman and Laura Sharma contributed to this post.



            Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman said yesterday he does not expect Democrats and Republicans to come to an agreement ahead of the February 13 government funding deadline for the Department of Homeland Security.
    


                    “I absolutely would expect that it's gonna shutdown,” Fetterman, who sits on the Homeland Security Committee, said in an interview with Fox News.“We, the Democrats, we provided, I think it was 10, 10 kinds of basic things, and then the Republican(s) pushed back quickly, saying that that's like a Christmas wish list and that they're non-starters,” he said, adding later: “If I had to say now, I would probably expect that there is going to be a shutdown.”
                





            If an agreement to fund DHS is not met, a partial shutdown is on the horizon, which would affect operations in that department. Agencies such as TSA, FEMA and the Coast Guard would all be impacted.
    


            Fetterman is one of eight Democrats who broke with their party at the end of last year to vote with Republicans to reopen the government after a 43-day shutdown.
    


            House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries also raised doubts about the prospect that Democrats and Republicans will come to an agreement on DHS. He told CNN's Dana Bash yesterday that his party hasn't heard back from the White House or GOP leaders on their “common sense” demands, adding, “in our view, the ball is in the court right now of the Republicans.”
    


            President Donald Trump — who skipped the Super Bowl and instead attended a watch party in Florida — denounced Bad Bunny's halftime performance as “a slap in the face” and said “nobody understands a word” the Puerto Rican rapper was saying.
    


                    “The Super Bowl Halftime Show is absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER! It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn't represent our standards of Success, Creativity, or Excellence,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. “This ‘Show' is just a ‘slap in the face' to our Country, which is setting new standards and records every single day.”
                





            Bad Bunny, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, rocked the stage Sunday night with many of his biggest hits, powerful imagery and theatrical nods to songs and symbols from throughout his Spanish-language catalog.
    


            During the performance, Bad Bunny delivered a unifying message, expanding the meaning of “God bless America” to include all nations of the Americas — from Chile to Canada.
    


            “God bless America, whether it's Chile, Argentina,” Bad Bunny said as he proceeded to list more than 20 nations in North and South America, and displayed the flags of many of them. He stood beside the US flag and the flag of Puerto Rico, a US territory.
    


            The president criticized both the language and choreography of the performance.
    


            “Nobody understands a word this guy is saying,” Trump wrote in his Truth Social, adding that the dancing was “disgusting,” particularly for young children watching across the US and around the world.
    

President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social his thought on Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime show. 


            Members of Congress can begin reviewing unredacted versions of the Jeffrey Epstein files at the Department of Justice today, according to a new letter obtained by CNN.
    


            The letter from DOJ outlines parameters for how members can review the unredacted versions of the more than 3 million pages that DOJ has released to the public.
    


                    Lawmakers will have access to computers in a reading room at DOJ where they cannot bring outside electronic devices but can take notes, according to the letter. The room will only be available to members and not staff, the letter stipulates. The DOJ asks members to provide 24 hours notice of when they'd like to view the materials.
                





            Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced last month upon the department's latest public release of Epstein files that members would be able to schedule appointments to view the unredacted versions.
    


            The architects of the law that required the Epstein files release, Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie, had requested to view the unredacted materials on January 30.
    


            Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, also requested that all Judiciary Committee Democrats get to review the documents before Attorney General Pam Bondi is set to testify in front of the panel on Wednesday.
    


Massie was interviewed by CNN's Manu Raji on Sunday.



            Jeffrey Epstein's accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of the sex trafficking of a minor and other charges in 2021, is expected to appear for a closed-door deposition on Capitol Hill today.
    


            House Oversight Chair James Comer announced last month that he expects Maxwell to assert her Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination and not actually testify.
    


                    “We have nailed down a date, February 9, where Ghislaine Maxwell will be deposed by this committee. Her lawyers have made it clear that she's going to plead the Fifth. I hope she changes her mind because I want to hear from her,” Comer said on January 21.
                





Video clips released January 30 showed Maxwell answering questions about Epstein under oath in 2016 in response to a civil suit.



            President Donald Trump drew swift condemnation from Democrats and Republicans for a since-deleted racist video posted to his Truth Social account depicting former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama as apes in a jungle.
    


            The social media post, which Trump has refused to apologize for sharing, was the latest in a long line of offensive messages amplified by the his account.
    


Here's what you need to know:



            The video Trump shared largely contained debunked claims about fraud in voting machines. As that section of the video ended, a separate clip showing the Obamas' faces superimposed on the bodies of apes played, set to the song “The Lion Sleeps Tonight.”
    


            The post, which recalls the racist trope of comparing Black people with monkeys, prompted swift backlash. It was online for roughly 12 hours before it was deleted from Trump's feed.
    


            The White House initially defended the post and downplayed the response to the video, calling it “fake outrage.” Following a bipartisan backlash, the White House then told CNN a “staffer erroneously made the post. It has been taken down.”
    


            Trump said that neither he nor his staff had seen all of the video before it was posted to Truth Social.
    


                    “Nobody knew that that was in the end. If they would have looked, they would have seen it, and probably they would have had the sense to take it down.”
                





            When asked directly whether he would apologize, he declined.
    


            When pressed, Trump said he condemned the racist portion of the clip. “Of course I do,” he said.
    


            “I am, by the way, the least racist president you've had in a long time,” he said.

            Want to understand how artificial intelligence could change your job? Look to radiology as a clue.
    


            Radiology has become a recent talking point in the AI race. It was mentioned multiple times last month by tech executives at the World Economic Forum in Davos as well as in a White House whitepaper about AI and the economy.
    


            Radiology is far from being the only occupation impacted by AI, which is gradually integrating into the work of software engineers, teachers and even plumbers, among many others. If widely adopted, Goldman Sachs estimates that advancements related to AI could displace 6 to 7% of the US workforce, although the technology is expected to create new jobs too.



            But the radiology field has become a case study for how AI could enhance, and not replace,  jobs. The type of work in radiology is also ideal for AI assistance, said Dr. Po-Hao Chen, a doctor specializing in diagnostic radiology at the Cleveland Clinic.
    


            Radiology has plenty of available data for AI research and applications, which need copious amounts of data for training. AI can parse through troves of data much more quickly than human workers can, and it is already helping to speed up certain processes in radiology — for example, figuring out which scans need immediate attention.
    


The surprising truth about AI's impact on jobs



            But human physicians are still required to do the bulk of the work – like making diagnoses, physically examining patients and writing reports. And radiology jobs are projected to grow faster than roles in other areas as the field continues to embrace the tech.
    


            “(AI) is not only not replacing those workers, but it's actually increasing the amount of work they can do and increasing demand for their services,”  said Jack Karsten, a research fellow at Georgetown's Center for Security and Emerging Technology. “That's sort of a bright future that the tech industry can point to as far as this is AI doing good in the economy.”
    


            AI is very good at analyzing images and spotting patterns in data, both critical to radiology. And the field has been digitized for years, meaning there is an abundance of data, according to Chen.
    


            “There are smaller use cases that are analogue still, but in the US for the most part, every X-ray, every CT (scan), every MRI, can be available as zeros and ones,” Chen said.
    


            Today, radiologists are using AI to help figure out which scans to prioritize, enhance image quality and assist with summarizing reports, according to Dr. Chen and two other radiology experts who spoke with CNN.
    


How AI shook the world in 2025 and what comes next



            “It's something that doesn't replace anyone, that just makes our job more efficient and more meaningful,” said Dr. Shadpour Demehri, who works in interventional radiology at Johns Hopkins Medicine.
    


            René Vidal, a professor in engineering and radiology at the University of Pennsylvania's Penn Engineering department, views AI as particularly useful for capturing high-quality MRI scans with fewer measurements. That speeds up the process and allows more patients to be seen in the same amount of time.
    


            Other applications are being explored in research, such as using AI to measure the volume of a tumor or automatically populate reports, although they're likely still far out, said Vidal.
    


            AI tools must be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for medical use, which could take around eight years considering the development process and clinical testing, Vidal said. But those approvals are certainly happening: Of the 1,357 AI-enabled medical devices currently with FDA approval, 1,041 are for radiology.
    


            At the same time, radiology jobs seem to be growing. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects employment in radiology will grow 5 percent from 2024 to 2034, which is higher than the average of 3% across all occupations. Data from Indeed provided to CNN also indicates there were more radiology jobs in 2025 compared to five years ago.
    


Like digging ‘your own professional grave': The translators grappling with losing work to AI



            Demand for imaging during the medical diagnosis process, along with an increased aging population, is likely driving the need for more radiology services, say the radiology experts who spoke with CNN.
    


            But that wasn't always the thinking. Nobel Prize-winning computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton, also referred to as the godfather of AI, said in 2016 that “people should stop training radiologists now” because deep learning – a subset of AI that models how the human brain learns – would handle the job better in five to 10 years.
    


            Hinton said in an email to the New York Times last year that he spoke too broadly in those 2016 comments.
    


            Demehri recalls there being a sense of anxiety in the radiology field about AI replacing human roles around the 2015 and 2016 timeframe. Now, the technology is seen as a “second set of eyes,” he said.
    


            Still, there are risks around bias and potential overreliance on AI, according to Chen. Unlike human radiologists, for example, AI can accurately predict a person's race based on an X-ray, according to a 2022 MIT study, raising concerns about bias in diagnoses.
    


AI hiring is here. It's making companies — and job seekers — miserable



            Chen says he also worries about the temptation to make staffing decisions – such as replacing a doctor with a nurse or a subspecialist radiologist with a primary care doctor – if AI becomes advanced enough. That might work in some cases, but not for the majority of conditions that radiology is used for, like detecting cancer or deadly infections.
    


            “We have to understand that a lot of the performance of (the) algorithm comes from the fact that the automation output is reviewed by an expert,” he said. “And together, this collaboration, if you will, between the machine and the expert is what makes the improvement real.”

The main suspect in the attempted assassination of Russian General Vladimir Alekseyev has confessed to investigators that he acted on orders from Ukraine, according to an interview video released Monday.

Alekseyev, the first deputy chief of Russia's military intelligence agency GUR, was shot on Friday in a communal hall of his residence in Moscow. The prime suspect, Lyubomir Korba, was arrested in the United Arab Emirates at Russia's request and transferred to Moscow over the weekend. Kiev has denied involvement in the crime.

In footage published by Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), the 65-year-old Ukrainian-born Russian citizen said he was already on Kiev's payroll and was promised $30,000 for killing the general.

Korba stated he was recruited by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) last August and sent to Moscow to surveil several targets, receiving $2,000 monthly from Ukraine. He said the order to prepare a hit on Alekseyev came in December.

“After the assassination attempt, I was instructed to go to the airport and take a flight to Dubai. In Dubai there was a ticket to Romania. From Romania I was supposed to be taken to Kiev. My group of handlers led by a general was supposed to meet me in Kiev,” he said.

The FSB alleges Polish special services assisted the SBU by involving Korba's son, a Polish citizen. Korba's acquaintance Viktor Vasin, who helped him rent an apartment, was arrested in Russia and confessed to knowingly aiding the Ukrainian plot, per another FSB video.

A third suspect, Zinaida Serebritskaya (née Antonyuk), also born in Soviet Ukraine, has fled Russia. She reportedly traveled to Türkiye on the eve of the shooting and is now in Ukraine.

The decadent lifestyle of disgraced US financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his entourage is a testament to the moral decay of Western elites, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said.

Last month, the US Department of Justice released a large trove of emails, photos, and videos from the Epstein state, prompting renewed scrutiny of high-profile individuals who associated with Epstein despite his conviction for sex crimes.

The files “have revealed the face of the West and the deep state, or rather a deep union that rules the entire West and seeks to rule the whole world,” Lavrov said in an interview with NTV aired on Sunday.

“Every normal person knows this is beyond comprehension and pure satanism,” Lavrov added.

Epstein died in a New York jail cell in 2019 in what was ruled a suicide. His ex-girlfriend and close associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for trafficking and abusing underage women alongside Epstein.

Throughout his life, Epstein associated with politicians, diplomats, businessmen, and royals, several of whom visited his private Caribbean island.

The newly released documents contain claims that Epstein and his associates participated in occult rituals involving human sacrifice. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced last week that his government would examine whether Polish children were abused as part of Epstein's so-called “satanic circle.”

MOSCOW, February 9. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin's initiative to build a Eurasian security architecture is gaining momentum and attracting increasing interest from other countries, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in an interview with TV BRICS.

Meanwhile, the United States is reluctant to follow through with its own proposals on Ukraine from the Anchorage summit.

TASS has compiled key statements from Russia's top diplomat.

The United States is now reluctant to follow through with proposals it put forward on Ukraine in Anchorage, and Russia sees ""no promising future in economic terms"" with the American side.

While Russia and the United States could have embraced broader cooperation following the summit in Anchorage, the opposite trend has been observed.

Moscow accepted Washington's proposal on Ukraine at the Anchorage talks that ""the Ukrainian issue must be resolved.""

The US position on Ukraine ""was important"" to Russia, regardless of what Kiev or Russophobic leaders in the European Union might have said.

Russia remains open to cooperation with the United States, but the Americans themselves ""create artificial obstacles.""

Not only has the administration of US President Donald Trump challenged the laws enacted by his predecessor Joe Biden ""to punish Russia,"" it has imposed additional sanctions. The core of this ""is sanctions against Russia, including the freezing of our gold and foreign currency reserves.""

Moscow is not seeking to reject the use of the US dollar, but Washington has transformed its currency into a weapon against those it views as inconvenient: ""Under the Biden administration, the United States took every step to weaponize the dollar against those it considers inconvenient.""

The United States has been using unfair methods to suppress its competitors, including by imposing sanctions on Russian oil majors: ""Unfair methods have been used against us —banning Russian oil companies like Lukoil and Rosneft.""

Also, the United States is attempting to control Russia's ""military-technical ties with major strategic partners,"" such as India and other BRICS members.

The North Atlantic Alliance, the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) have outlived their time: ""Attention was concentrated on Western Eurasia, while the rest was largely considered under European control.""

Russia is not advocating for the abolition of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank (WB) or the World Trade Organization (WTO), instead it is has sought to reform those institutions so BRICS can ""receive proportional votes and rights in all Bretton Woods institutions, commensurate with their actual weight in the global economy, trade, and logistics.""

Russia pays particular attention ""to the CIS, the Eurasian Economic Union, the CSTO and, more broadly, the post-Soviet space.""

The BRICS grouping can contribute to harmonizing comprehensive development plans across countries of the global majority: ""BRICS provides, in effect, an overarching framework for integration across continents.""

Russia should ensure its security in a situation where some Europe ""threaten war against our country:"" ""Security also requires preventing the continued existence on our borders of a Nazi state created by the West out of Ukraine and used once again to wage war against Russia.""

The West has unleashed a global war on Russia and is making ""frantic attempts"" to punish its partners.

Russia will reject the deployment in Ukraine of any weapons that may threaten its security interests: ""We will, without any doubt, safeguard our security interests by preventing the deployment on Ukrainian territory of any weapons that pose a threat to us.""

Western countries have invented the ‘shadow fleet' and are trying to detain vessels ""on the high seas through the use of force"" in the fight for outgoing dominance.

Putin's initiative ""to strengthen Eurasian security and build a continental security architecture, is gaining momentum"" and increasingly attracting interest from other countries.

The United States ""is objectively losing its economic influence and weight in the world economy,"" while countries in the Global South are making themselves heard in the international arena.

The initiatives put forward by BRICS, including regarding payments and investments, are not meant to counteract the United States, but rather to establish mechanisms that are independent on Washington's strict control: ""These initiatives are not intended as a provocation against anyone, primarily the United States, but rather arise from the fact that the United States places strict control over all processes in these areas and demands unilateral concessions.""

BRICS countries will handle their energy security ""in the context of actions taken by the Trump administration in the global energy sector.""","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, February 9. /TASS/. The suspects detained in the case of an assassination attempt against Russian Lieutenant General Vladimir Alexeyev confessed to having acted on orders from the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU), Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) reported.

TASS has gathered the key information about the detainees and their testimonies.

- Lyubomir Korba, the gunman who attacked Lieutenant General Vladimir Alexeyev, was recruited by the SBU in August 2025 and underwent firearms training at a training range in Kiev, the FSB said, adding that Polish intelligence agencies had helped in his recruitment.

- Korba watched high-ranking military officers in the Moscow Region; Ukrainian intelligence agencies provided him with a gun through a cache outside Moscow.

- An electronic key to the front door of the apartment building where Alexeyev lives was sent to Korba through a cache by a woman named Zinaida Serebritskaya, who had rented an apartment there.

- Viktor Vasin, detained for complicity in the assassination attempt against General Alexeyev, is a supporter of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, designated in Russia as a terrorist organization.

- Ukrainian intelligence agencies promised to pay Korba $30,000 for killing Alexeyev.

- The detainees have admitted and provided details of preparations for the assassination attempt against Alexeyev, carried out on orders from the Ukrainian Security Service, the FSB said.

- The assassination attempt on Alexeyev took place in a residential building in northwestern Moscow on February 6.

- The gunman fired several shots at him.

- According to the FSB, the suspected attacker, Russian citizen Lyubomir Korba, born in 1960, was detained in Dubai with the assistance of UAE law enforcement and handed over to Russia.

- His accomplices were identified as Russian nationals Viktor Vasin, detained in Moscow, and Zinaida Serebritskaya, who fled to Istanbul the day before the attack.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Ian Michael Elliott of neofascist Patriot Front worked ‘crisis relief missions' funded by Department of Agriculture

A federal security contractor that has been awarded millions of dollars by the Department of Agriculture hired a prominent white nationalist leader to work on its patrols last year.

Ian Michael Elliott, a longstanding senior figure in the neofascist group Patriot Front, was part of “crisis relief missions” undertaken on the US west coast by Knight Division Tactical, according to an image shared on LinkedIn in September by one of the company's executives.

Elliott is shown posing alongside other people as he helps hold up a flag with the contractor's logo on it. “Stellar company, sharp agents, quality work!” he would later write, in a five-star review posted on Knight Division Tactical's Google Maps page.

Knight Division Tactical did not respond to multiple requests for comment, though the company executive deleted his LinkedIn post showing Elliott after the Guardian reached out.

Elliott has long been a senior figure in Patriot Front, which researchers have identified as responsible for producing the majority of white supremacist propaganda in the US.

The group, which markets itself to disillusioned white men, has been likened to a “white nationalist pyramid scheme”. In 2023, five of its members were convicted over a plot to start a riot at a gay pride event.

Patriot Front is perhaps best known for organizing militaristic white nationalist marches through US cities, with nearly all of the participants hiding their faces. After a March in Louisville, Kentucky, last year, Courier Journal columnist Joseph Gerth called them “masked cowards” who “despise anyone who believes in an inclusive society”.

Earlier this month, Patriot Front members were present at the National Mall in Washington DC during the annual anti-abortion March for Life, where JD Vance spoke. Video posted by the group on Telegram shows that Elliott, who frequently serves as the bodyguard of the Patriot Front founder Thomas Rousseau, was among them.

Last year, Nashville's NewsChannel 5 revealed that Elliott is one of the leaders of efforts by Patriot Front to develop a 122-acre (49-hectare) compound near Tellico Plains, Tennessee, where white nationalists receive combat training in preparation for what they believe is a coming race war.

“They're kind of an entry portal, a place that seeks to recruit young, disillusioned white men who are interested in mixed martial arts, interested in fighting, interested in the idea of saving western civilization,” said Jon Lewis, a research fellow at the program on extremism at George Washington University who studies US white supremacist movements.

He added that Patriot Front is one of several groups that has contributed to “the mainstreaming of fringe concepts that have helped radicalize young men, like the ‘great replacement' theory, something now echoed by figures close to the White House like Stephen Miller and Elon Musk”.

Elliott also leads Patria Gloria, a white nationalist grappling team affiliated with Patriot Front, and the neo-Nazi active clubs movement ⁠–⁠ Telegram posts show that Patria Gloria invited several active clubs to participate in training at the Tellico Plains compound last spring.

Experts have warned that active clubs make up a decentralized network of combat-ready white nationalist cells, and the Southern Poverty Law Center reported last year that Patriot Front secretly controls about a dozen of them; video posted on Patria Gloria's Telegram channel shows that Elliott represented Patriot Front at a tournament hosted by the Southern California Active Club last year.

Recently, a Russian street fighting promoter, whose ties to US white nationalists and active clubs the Guardian revealed last October, posted to Instagram that Elliott is joining its stable of fighters under the alias Norman.

Images posted on Telegram show Elliott training fellow white nationalists at Patriot Front's Tennessee compound. CNN reported last month that the building where Elliott held the training has been put up for sale, though Patriot Front intends to move forward with its plans to build out a large compound on surrounding land.

Elliott did not reply to a request for comment via Telegram. The app shows a message sent to his account was viewed.

How a prominent white supremacist leader came to work for a federal security contractor is unclear.

“It's not that surprising that there are white supremacists getting hired by government contractors,” said Lewis. “When officials are flooding the zone with the most racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, antisemitic and Islamophobic messages ⁠–⁠ take your pick ⁠–⁠ it's going to embolden groups like Patriot Front. It's going to tell them: ‘You have an ally in the White House, you have an ally in the Department of Justice.'”

State records show that, in 2023, the company was incorporated in Wyoming, a popular location for business registrations because there is no state income tax. It subsequently established branches in several other states and, according to its website, maintains offices in College Station, Texas.

Knight Division Tactical recruits heavily on social media, especially Instagram, where it has amassed 60,000 followers and frequently shares stylized memes promising potential recruits lucrative assignments in exotic locales.

For example, the company has in recent months claimed to have upcoming “missions” in Mongolia and Nigeria and has encouraged people in France and Switzerland to apply for work, advertising that successful applicants can earn up to $1,000 a day.

Meanwhile, federal procurement records show the company's sole government contracting activity in the US has been providing unarmed security and patrol services for the US Forest Service, the subagency of the Department of Agriculture that oversees the country's national forests and grasslands.

Knight Division Tactical was awarded $1.8m in contracts by the agency in the 2024 fiscal year and $2.1m in 2025.

Among them were two contracts around the time that one of the company's executives posted the image of Elliott as part of its crew on LinkedIn.

The first, valued at $350,275.48, was for security services in Eureka, California, from 17 July to 8 August 2025. The second, valued at $681.230.50, was also for security services in the area from 28 August to 16 October.

In videos posted on Knight Division Tactical's social media pages, co-founder and chief executive officer Michael Schulz has stated the company performs background checks on applicants early in the recruitment process. (Elliott's involvement with Patriot Front and other white nationalist groups can be uncovered with a basic Google search.)

“Companies contracted by the US Department of Agriculture's Forest Service manage their own hiring, background checks and oversight of personnel, independent of the agency,” said a spokesperson for the agency in a statement.

In addition to heavily recruiting online, Knight Division Tactical and its leadership also frequently post about conservative social issues and their professed Orthodox Christian faith. “We are elite Private Security Contractors,” wrote Schulz in a 2024 Facebook post. “We uphold the highest order of Christian virtues.”

The company's logo is a double-headed eagle, one of the most prominent Orthodox symbols dating to the Byzantine empire. In a 2024 Instagram post, Schulz said the company encourages contractors to participate in prayer and scripture studies together.

In November, co-founder and chief operating officer Matthew McCalla shared a social media post extolling historical Orthodox leaders who oversaw the killing of Muslim combatants in wartime.

In addition, Schulz is listed on incorporation records as the director of a traditionalist men's Christian organization called the Guild of Gentlemen that claims to “restore European civilization and the cultures within it”.

On its website, the guild blames feminism for the “destruction of women” and refers to the concepts of “racism” and “transgenderism” as “evil Marxist talking points”.

The site says the group held a conference in Dallas in 2024 and that Knight Division Tactical provided security for the event.

In an August 2025 podcast interview, Schulz and McCalla also claimed their company was developing a proprietary “crisis prediction and threat prediction technology” that can anticipate forest fires, hurricanes and terrorist attacks using unspecified data and information models.

Earlier this month, the company said on Instagram that it was “launching a pre-cursor to a major new technology”. For the time being, it added, that precursor was a server on the Discord app that costs $49.99 per month.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theguardian.com","Files cast light on Jeffrey Epstein's ties to cryptocurrency","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/feb/09/jeffrey-epstein-crypto","Mon, 09 Feb 2026 14:17:00 GMT","

Newly released documents detail convicted sex offender's early backing of bitcoin and Coinbase 

Millions of files related to Jeffrey Epstein have brought to light his ties to the highest echelons of the cryptocurrency industry.

Documents published last week by the US Department of Justice reveal Epstein bankrolled the “principal home and funding source” for bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, during its nascent stages; he also invested $3m in Coinbase in 2014, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US, and cut a check that same year to Blockstream, a prominent bitcoin-focused technology firm. Both crypto startups accepted Epstein's investments in 2014 – six years after his 2008 conviction in Florida for soliciting prostitution from a minor.

Despite murmurings among crypto communities online about the need for a sector-level reckoning around the Epstein files' revelations, most industry players predict few consequences for crypto companies or the sector writ large. Some see Epstein as a “skeptical investor” who pulled out of his crypto investments prematurely; others go so far as to claim Epstein was attempting to “undermine bitcoin”.

The crypto companies that secured Epstein's investment have grown into multibillion-dollar giants, especially Coinbase, which went public on the Nasdaq in 2021, and whose co-founder, Brian Armstrong, has heavily influenced crypto regulation in the United States.

Epstein's 2014 investment in Coinbase was brokered by the crypto evangelist Brock Pierce, a former child actor and a co-founder of Tether, the world's largest issuer of stablecoins, a kind of cryptocurrency whose value is typically pegged to a national currency.

Documents published by the justice department reveal Fred Ehrsam, a co-founder of Coinbase who spearheaded its fundraise, liaised with Pierce about Epstein's investment in the company and sought to meet with Epstein “if convenient”. Additional filings suggest Epstein sold half of his shares to Pierce's firm, Blockchain Capital, for $15m in 2018.

A spokeswoman for Coinbase declined to comment; Pierce did not respond to requests for comment.

Epstein's financing of bitcoin's development stemmed from his role as a donor to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Over the course of 20 years, MIT accepted more than $800,000 from Epstein, who also facilitated more than $7m in donations from other wealthy individuals.

In communications from 2015 between Joichi Ito, then director of MIT's Media Lab, a tech-focused research institute, and Epstein, Ito wrote that Epstein's “gift funds” were used to “underwrite” the launch of the Digital Currency Initiative, an offshoot of the Lab tasked with researching and developing open-source crypto technologies; in the same email thread, Ito explained that the Lab's role was to serve as the “principal home and funding source” for bitcoin. The Digital Currency Initiative did not respond to requests for comment.

In 2014, Ito brokered Epstein's investment in Blockstream, which builds bitcoin-focused tech solutions. Epstein made a $500,000 early-stage investment in the company through an investment fund he co-owned with Ito. Email communications reveal Blockstream's co-founders, Adam Back and Austin Hill, were invited by Epstein to meet in St Thomas, close to Little Saint James, the private island Epstein owned.

On Twitter, Back claimed that Blockstream understood Epstein to be a “limited partner in Ito's fund”, which later divested from Blockstream “due to a potential conflict of interest, and other concerns” – meaning that “Blockstream has no direct nor indirect financial connection with Jeffrey Epstein, or his estate”.

In communications with an Italian investor, Epstein noted that he “like[d]” Back. Hill continued communicating with Epstein into 2017, checking in with his “friend” following a storm in the Caribbean. “Just checking that your Island is OK,” reads the email thread's subject line. Representatives for Blockstream and Hill did not respond to requests for comment.

Luke Dashjr, an early contributor to bitcoin's development as well as to Blockstream, has called for Adam Back to resign from his role as Blockstream's CEO over ties to Epstein. In an interview with the Guardian, Dashjr said Epstein's interest in bitcoin – namely, his “attempts to undermine” bitcoin's network, early-stage companies, and developers – was a sign that “evil men often seek to destroy what is good”.

Charlotte Fang, the founder of Remilia, which makes NFTs and other crypto-based art, said “only unserious people might care” about Epstein's investment in bitcoin and Coinbase; in the latter case, “only the financially unsophisticated” would assume that he had “any degree of influence over the direction” of the exchange, as his seven-figure investment was a small part of Coinbase's fundraise.

“Bitcoin is a decentralized technology that required no funding, and Epstein was evidently a skeptical investor, who got in later than I did, and exited earlier than he should have,” Fang said.

“Generally speaking, retail consumers will not change their habits” around crypto following this recent release of Epstein files, according to Kadan Stadelmann of Komodo, a crypto platform. Investor practices, including their dependence on connections to cut checks, will probably adhere to the status quo, he added. Some competitor crypto exchanges might see new customers who are leaving Coinbase following these new allegations, he hypothesized – as long as these exchanges didn't take money from “similar unsavory sources”.

As to why Epstein was so interested in crypto, and in Coinbase specifically? “Epstein might have liked Coinbase's IPO prospects,” he surmised.

Cryptocurrencies' technological capabilities may have also played a role in Epstein's interest in the sector, said Antulio Rosales, a professor at York University who studies crypto.

“There's his possibility of seeing markets without any ethical commitments, and without any pressures of social norms and of the law itself,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Despite an expanded release to some 2,000 screens, the gushing enthusiasm recorded on the vox pop Popcornometer is not powering a word-of-mouth hit

Melania, Brett Ratner's authorised documentary following the first lady in the 20 days preceding Donald Trump's January 2025 inauguration, has dipped 67% in its second week of release in the US.

The film outpaced expectations over its first weekend, taking in $7.2m domestically and leading Amazon to expand their rollout from around 1,500 venues to just over 2,000. But indications are that appetite had already been sated, with Sunday projections standing at $2.3m, meaning a drop from No 3 to No 10 in the US box office charts.

Amazon pre-empted this disappointment with a statement on Saturday, flagging the film's already healthy performance, as well as what they hope will be long streaming legs.

“Melania's strong theatrical performance is a critical first moment that validates our holistic distribution strategy, building awareness, engagement and provides momentum ahead of the film's eventual debut on Prime Video,” said Amazon MGM distribution chief Kevin Wilson.

A streaming release date has not yet been announced.

The film, for which Amazon paid $40m after a bidding war, and then spent a further $35m on marketing, was released in 26 countries worldwide (a South African release was abruptly cancelled at the 11th hour).

Although international statistics are hard to source, the film has performed markedly less well across its some 3,000 overseas screens.

Top performing territories include the UK, where it opened at No 29 in the chart, taking £32,974 for a £212 per screen average, as well as Australia and Melania Trump's native Slovenia.

Critics have almost universally slated the movie, with the Guardian's Xan Brooks calling it “a gilded trash remake of The Zone of Interest” and “two hours of pure, endless hell”.

But audiences appear to have felt otherwise, leading to a record-breaking gap between the aggregate critics' score and audience members' equivalent on reviews curation site Rotten Tomatoes.

On that site its official reviews rating is just 8%, yet it has a 99% score from cinemagoers on the “Popcornmeter”, with one user praising “the best documentary I've seen in years. The cinematography was superb, the soundtrack was excellent, and Melania herself was spectacular, a great movie which should receive numerous awards”.

Rotten Tomatoes's parent company Versant has rejected speculation that the latter figure was the result of a flood of fake reviews, telling Variety “there has been NO manipulation on the audience reviews for the Melania documentary”.

They added: “Reviews displayed on the Popcornmeter are VERIFIED reviews, meaning that it has been verified that users have bought a ticket to the film through Fandango”.

However, there appears to be a striking disparity between the warmth of those reviews labelled “verified” because the users have bought a ticket through a particular site and those collected in “all audience reviews” – which do not count towards its rating.

The former contains – as the 99% rating suggests – blanket praise and evangelism, with users urging “every red blooded American to see this movie to recognise the grace, sophistication and power of Flotius [sic]” and applauding the lack of nudity and profanity.

The users commenting appear in the overwhelming majority to be first-time posters, for whom Melania is their first review.

Critiques in the “all audience reviews” section tend to derive from accounts with a deeper prior engagement on the site, and include assessments such as “I thought it would have been based on her actual life, good and bad. There was no emotion, drama or depth. It's just a bad reality show,” and “Hot garbage. Don't waste your time or money.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The Bhumjaithai Party of Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul was on track to win the most seats in Thailand's general election, according to unofficial results released by the state Election Commission after about 94 percent of polling stations had reported yesterday.

It was the first decisive victory of a conservative party in Thailand in years. Sunday's election came against a backdrop of slow economic growth and heightened nationalist sentiment. Voter turnout stood at about 65 percent, significantly lower than in the 2023 election.

The commission's running count, shown on its Web site, indicated that Bhumjaithai won about 193 seats in the 500-member Thai House of Representatives.

The lower house comprises 400 lawmakers directly elected based on constituencies, while 100 others are chosen from “party list” nominees, who gain seats according to each party's proportional share of the vote on a separate ballot indicating party preference.

A simple majority of 251 seats is needed for the body to elect a prime minister. The figures indicate Bhumjaithai would have to seek one or two partners to form a coalition government with Anutin returning as its head.

The progressive People's Party, which had been tipped to win the most seats, was holding down second place with 118 seats. It swept all constituencies in Bangkok and a majority in the capital's neighboring provinces. The party also took a lead in the party list totals, taking about 3.8 million more votes on party list ballots than Bhumjaithai.

Pheu Thai, the populist party representing the political machine of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, trailed behind with 74 seats. It was considered a disappointing result for a political force that has often dominated Thai elections.

It is widely believed that Pheu Thai would accept, if asked, to join a coalition government led by Bhumjaithai.

Anutin has been prime minister since September last year, after serving in the Cabinet of his immediate predecessor, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who was forced out of office for an ethics violation regarding mishandling relations with Cambodia. 

Anutin dissolved parliament in December to call a new election after he was threatened with a no-confidence vote.

Subsequent border clashes with Cambodia allowed Anutin to recast himself as a wartime leader after his popularity initially slipped because of floods and financial scandals. His campaign focused on national security and economic stimulus.

While the result diverged from what earlier polls suggested, Bhumjaithai's victory did not come as a surprise, said Napon Jatusripitak, director of the Center for Politics and Geopolitics at Thailand Future, a Bangkok-based think tank.

Beyond the nationalist boost from the border clashes, Napon said Bhumjaithai capitalized on traditional patronage networks outside Bangkok and major urban areas. 

The party strategically positioned itself as a natural home for well-connected local politicians and worked with provincial allies to avoid vote splitting, Napon said.

“The result may have resolved a recurring dilemma in Thai politics, whereby conservative interests have repeatedly intervened to curtail democratic politics after losing at the ballot box. Whether this configuration produces genuine stability, however, remains to be seen,” he added.

Sunday's voting included a referendum asking voters whether Thailand should replace its 2017 military-drafted constitution.

The vote was not on a proposed draft, but rather to decide whether to authorize parliament to begin a formal drafting process, which would require many further steps before coming to fruition. About 60 percent voted in favor, delivering a clear mandate for starting work on a new draft.

Schellenberg was detained on drug charges in 2014 before China-Canada ties nosedived following the 2018 arrest in Vancouver of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou (孟晚舟).
That arrest infuriated Beijing, which detained two Canadians — Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig — on espionage charges that Ottawa condemned as retaliatory.

RUSSIA

Lavrov skeptical of US ties

Russia remains open for cooperation with the US, but is not hopeful about economic ties despite Washington's ongoing efforts to end the Ukraine war, Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov said in an interview published yesterday. Speaking to media outlet TV BRICS, Lavrov cited what he called the US' declared aim of “economic dominance.” Russian officials, including special presidential envoy on foreign investment and economic cooperation Kirill Dmitriev, have previously spoken of the prospects for a major restoration of economic relations with the US as part of any eventual Ukraine peace settlement. However, although US President Donald Trump has also spoken of reviving economic cooperation with Moscow and has hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin on US soil since returning to the White House, he has imposed further onerous sanctions on Russia's energy sector. Lavrov also cited Trump's hostility to the BRICS bloc, which includes Russia, China, India, Brazil and other major developing economies. “The Americans themselves create artificial obstacles along this path” toward BRICS integration,” he said. “We are simply forced to seek additional, protected ways to develop our financial, economic, logistical and other projects with the BRICS countries.”

Seguro wins presidency

Socialist Antonio Jose Seguro won the presidential race, defeating far-right challenger Andre Ventura in a runoff that reaffirmed the nation's tradition of consensus-driven leadership after a turbulent campaign. Seguro secured 66.8 percent of the vote in Sunday's second-round vote, official results showed. A former Socialist Party leader, he ran on a platform of institutional stability and respect for democratic norms, overcoming Ventura, whose rise had raised concerns about potential political disruption. Official tallies showed that 49.9 percent of registered voters abstained. While the presidency is largely ceremonial, the role comes with key powers, including the ability to dissolve parliament and call early elections. Seguro's victory is likely to ease tensions with the center-right government of Prime Minister Luis Montenegro and limit the scope for confrontation between the presidency and parliament.

‘Bride imports' spark fury

A provincial government has apologized after a mayor suggested importing young women from Southeast Asia to boost the nation's birthrate. Jindo County Mayor Kim Hee-soo last week said rural hamlets could address shrinking populations by pairing bachelors with women enticed from Vietnam or Sri Lanka. “We should import young women from Vietnam or Sri Lanka so that young men in rural areas can marry them,” he told a town hall meeting. The remarks were condemned in local media and triggered a diplomatic backlash, reportedly drawing an official complaint from the Vietnamese embassy in Seoul. The South Jeolla provincial government, which oversees Kim's county, sought to dampen the brewing controversy over the weekend. “We deeply apologize for the inappropriate remark made by the Jindo mayor, which has caused deep pain to Vietnamese people and to women,” a spokesperson said on Saturday. The word “import” used in Kim's remark “violates human dignity and objectifies women,” the spokesperson said, adding that it could never be “justified under any circumstances.” Kim also apologized, conceding he had “used the inappropriate word.”

Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) claimed on Feb. 9 that suspects in the assassination attempt on Lieutenant General Vladimir Alekseev, the first deputy head of Russian military intelligence (GRU), had pleaded guilty, Russian state-run media outlet RIA Novosti reported.

The FSB earlier said Alekseev's attackers were two individuals, Lyubomyr Korba and Viktor Vasin, who allegedly acted on Ukraine's orders. The Ukrainian government has denied any involvement in the attempted attack on the Russian general.

According to the FSB, Korba and Vasin were allegedly recruited by Ukraine's Security Service (SBU), which promised $30,000 for the assassination of General Alekseev. The FSB also claimed that Polish intelligence was involved in Korba's recruitment, using his son, Lubosz Korba, who lives in Katowice.

Lyubomyr Korba was allegedly recruited in August 2025 in Ternopil, western Ukraine. He then underwent training at a facility in Kyiv before traveling to Moscow via Tbilisi, Georgia, FSB said.

In Moscow, the suspect allegedly spied on high-ranking military officials and, in December 2025, received an order to kill Alekseev. 

His accomplice, Zinaida Serebritskaya, allegedly gave Korba the keys to the entrance of the general's residence, where she also lived. According to the FSB, she has since allegedly moved to Ukraine.

Another co-conspirator, Vasin, rented the apartment where Korba lived and provided him with public transportation tickets. The FSB said Vasin had participated in protests in Moscow and supported the Anti-Corruption Foundation, a non-profit organization founded in 2024 by the murdered opposition leader Alexei Navalny.

All three suspects are reportedly facing charges that could result in life imprisonment.

Bulgarian investigative journalist and head of investigations at The Insider, Christo Grozev, suggested on X that one of the suspects, Vasin, works for an FSB-linked company that manufactures surveillance tools.

""At least through August 2025, Viktor Vasin was employed as 'chief expert' at NTC Atlas, launched by FSB and now part of military-industrial behemoth Rostec,"" Grozev wrote.

According to him, Vasin also graduated from Russia's military command communications academy, which was listed on his CV in 2014.

The attempted assassination of Alekseev is ""much more likely"" to have been linked to a ""domestic issue,"" given the general's role in the 2023 uprising of the Wagner Group, a mercenary unit, a former official told the Washington Post.

Alekseev was then involved in suppressing the mercenary uprising and was reportedly seen meeting with the group's leader, Yevgeniy Prigozhin, before Prigozhin died in a plane crash widely suspected of being orchestrated by Russia's intelligence services.

Alekseev was shot multiple times in Moscow by an unknown assailant, the Kremlin said on Feb 6. The following day, on Feb. 7, Russian state media reported that Alekseev had regained consciousness after successfully undergoing surgery.

Alekseev — born in 1961 in Soviet Ukraine — is the first deputy head of Russian military intelligence (GRU), serving in the role since 2011.

He was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2016 for organizing ""malicious cyber activities"" during the U.S. presidential election of that year which saw Donald Trump win his first term in office.

The Kremlin reportedly awarded him the title of Hero of the Russian Federation the following year.

Alekseev has also been accused by the U.K. and EU of orchestrating the chemical weapons attack in Salisbury in 2018 that targeted Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter.

The number of complaints has increased 333 times since the start of the full-scale invasion, according to Ukraine's Human Rights Ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets.

Ukraine targeted a Russian drone warehouse in Rostov-on-Don, located in Rostov Oblast, destroying three containers filled with FPV drones and their components, according to the report.

""We are moving from supplies to joint production and long-term solutions that systematically strengthen our defense,"" Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said.

The Hungarian government said on Feb. 8 that it is providing consular protection to its citizen detained by Ukraine over allegedly trying to help five Ukrainian draft-age men illegally cross the border.

The number includes 1,250 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

Russian forces carried out a series of attacks overnight on Feb. 8-9, targeting various cities with reported missile and drone attacks.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused the Trump administration of refusing to implement alleged Russia–U.S. agreements on Ukraine and pursuing a policy of ""economic domination,"" in comments to Russian-registered TV BRICS published on Feb. 9.

The remarks mark a sharper turn in Moscow's rhetoric toward Washington, with Lavrov claiming the U.S. has backtracked on what he described as ""Anchorage agreements"" allegedly reached in 2025 that envisioned Ukraine surrendering the entire Donbas region to Russia without fighting.

""They tell us that the Ukrainian issue needs to be resolved. In Anchorage, we accepted the proposal of the U.S.,"" Lavrov said. ""They made an offer, we agreed, and the problem should have been resolved. It seems that they proposed it and we were ready — and now they are not.""

The White House has not confirmed the existence of any such agreements, and earlier declined to acknowledge them in comments to the Kyiv Independent.

Lavrov said that despite declarations about moving toward ""full-scale, broad cooperation,"" Washington continues to pursue what he described as an anti-Russian policy. He pointed to new sanctions and Western actions against Russia's shadow fleet of oil tankers as evidence. 

""In practice, everything looks the opposite: new sanctions are being introduced, and a war against (shadow fleet) tankers is being waged on the high seas,"" the minister said.

Russia has long demanded that Ukrainian forces withdraw from Donbas and has increasingly tied any future peace deal to such a move after more than a decade of fighting in the region.

Ukraine has ruled out a withdrawal, though Ukrainian officials have said alternative arrangements, including a demilitarized zone, could be considered. 

The U.S. has also floated the idea of a free economic zone in parts of the war-torn region.

Washington has reportedly told Kyiv that security guarantees would follow only after a peace agreement with Russia, a deal widely expected to involve territorial issues related to Donbas. 

A U.S. source familiar with the matter told the Kyiv Independent that Washington ""is not trying to force any territorial concessions upon Ukraine,"" adding that ""both sides must agree to a peace deal, but the contents of the peace deal are up to Russia and Ukraine.""

Territorial questions remain the main obstacle in the negotiations.

Lavrov also criticized the Trump administration for not repealing laws adopted under former U.S. President Joe Biden that imposed sanctions on Russia after the start of its full-scale invasion.

The comments come as diplomatic activity intensifies around efforts to end Russia's war, with trilateral talks involving Ukraine, the U.S., and Russia potentially resuming as early as this week. 

President Volodymyr Zelensky has said Washington is pushing for the war to end before the start of summer and may apply pressure on the parties in line with that timeline.

U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker pushed back on that characterization, saying on Feb. 9 that the United States has not set any deadline for ending the war.

""That June deadline was mentioned by President Zelensky,"" he said. I don't think that is anything that the United States has put out there. We'd like it sooner rather than later.""

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Feb. 5 that Washington would decide whether to impose additional sanctions on Russia based on progress in the peace talks.

The FSB earlier said Alekseev's attackers were two individuals, Lyubomyr Korba and Viktor Vasin, who allegedly acted on Ukraine's orders. Kyiv denied these claims. 

The Hungarian government said on Feb. 8 that it is providing consular protection to its citizen detained by Ukraine over allegedly trying to help five Ukrainian draft-age men illegally cross the border.

The number includes 1,250 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

Russian forces carried out a series of attacks overnight on Feb. 8-9, targeting various cities with reported missile and drone attacks.

Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger tells DW the 2026 Munich Security Conference comes when ""obviously, trust has been damaged"" by President Trump. But he also says US calls for a more ""self-reliant"" Europe are fair and overdue.

The organizers of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) did not hesitate to name one world leader who they think is behind the current ""period of wrecking-ball politics.""

""The most powerful of those who take the axe to existing rules and institutions is US President Donald Trump,"" they wrote in the Munich Security Report 2026released on Monday.

The release came as organizers announced that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will lead ""a sizable delegation"" of officials to the MSC this weekend.

Conference chairman Wolfgang Ischinger spoke to DW on Monday, before the annual event opens its doors in the Bavarian capital. 

He said he saw two core functions for this year's MSC, the first he likened to a ""bicycle repair shop,"" oiling the chain and getting trans-Atlantic ties rolling again after a tense few weeks. 

""Part of our mission, I think, is to at least offer the possibility of repair work in terms of rebuilding, trust, confidence building, et cetera among trans-Atlantic partners. Obviously, trust has been damaged. Think of Greenland,"" Ischinger told DW's Nina Haase. 

The MSC will bring together about 65 world leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, along with nearly 100 foreign and defense ministers, top military brass and high-level policymakers for three days of discussions.

Ischinger, a former US ambassador closely associated with the event for decades, said he also hoped the event would contribute to a more self-reliant Europe, ""after 80 years of relying on the American security umbrella.""

""It's not written in the Bible, as the Polish prime minister used to say, that 450 million Europeans need 350 million Americans to defend themselves against 140 million Russians,"" Ischinger said. ""Why can we not comply with the American demand of doing more for ourselves to become more capable, more self-reliant? We should.""

At the 2025 MSC, Vice President JD Vance launched a blistering attack on the US's European allies , accusing EU leaders of curbing free speech, permitting too much migration and ignoring voters' views.

Vance held talks with AfD party leaders, not represented in Munich that year, on the same visit. But Ischinger told DW that the far-right German party's return in 2026 had nothing to do with pressure from the US administration. 

""That's just a myth. I've never been approached by anyone from the US side about that at all,"" he said. 

""Second, I just want to make sure that everyone understands my sympathy for the AfD is close to zero. I have no sympathy for this party, but I need to recognize I am the head of a private foundation which runs a private, independent dialogue forum called the Munich Security Conference,"" Ischinger said. 

He said that when his predecessor Christoph Heusgen revoked AfD invitations, there was a very specific context. 

""The AfD had just walked out of a speech by President Zelenskyy in the German Bundestag [parliament], which was really something which made everybody, including myself, very, very angry. But since that moment, we've had elections in this country. And the AfD is now the single largest opposition party. Should I ignore that?"" he asked.

The 2026 Munich Security Report also aims to focus on what Ischinger called ""the elephant in the room,"" a broader backlash against the principles that have underpinned global governance since 1945.

""For generations, US allies were not just able to rely on American power but on a broadly shared understanding of the principles underpinning the international order,"" Ischinger wrote in his foreword to the report.

""Today, this appears far less certain, raising difficult questions about the future shape of transatlantic and international cooperation,"" he added.

While Rubio will lead the Trump administration's delegation, some prominent US critics of the president will also speak at the MSC. 

California Governor Gavin Newsom, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York are all scheduled to participate.

The report warns that across Western democracies, public trust in institutions is eroding, and parties promising radical change are gaining ground.

""The result is a new climate in which those who employ bulldozers, wrecking balls, and chainsaws are often cautiously admired if not openly celebrated,"" the report says.

Trump's disruptive approach appeals to supporters who believe breaking established institutions can overcome political gridlock, as seen in moves on NATO spending and an Israel-Hamas ceasefire.

But the long-term result may be a shift toward transactional, interest-driven global politics.

""Ironically, this would be a world that privileges the rich and powerful, not those who have placed their hopes in wrecking-ball politics,"" the report stresses.

Globally, the US ""renunciation of core elements of the existing international order"" is straining systems already under pressure, from the WTO to humanitarian aid, the report states.

In Europe, Washington's wavering support for Ukraine and shifting security signals are deepening fears as Russia intensifies military and hybrid attacks.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is among the most prominent guests expected in Munich.

In the Indo-Pacific, partners face growing uncertainty as China pushes for dominance and US commitments appear increasingly unpredictable.

Ischinger emphasized that regardless of how one views current US foreign policy, it is already reshaping the world in profound ways, with consequences that are only beginning to unfold.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Thailand election: PM Anutin Charnvirakul claims victory","https://www.dw.com/en/thailand-holds-parliamentary-election-and-constitutional-referendum/a-75858485","Mon, 09 Feb 2026 09:50:03 GMT","

Early projections have Thailand's prime minister winning by a clear margin, with the opposition conceding defeat in Thailand's parliamentary elections. The snap election was called in December.

Thailand's conservative Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul on Sunday claimed victory in the country's parliamentary elections after television projections showed his party winning nearly 200 seats.

The vote was a three-way race between the reformist People's Party, the conservative Bhumjaithai Party of incumbent Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul and Pheu Thai, the party backed by the still-influential Shinawatra family.

""We are likely to take first place in the election,"" Anutin told reporters at his party headquarters in Bangkok.

""The victory today belongs to all Thais, no matter whether you voted for us or not.""

""We acknowledge that we did not come first,"" People's Party leader Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut told reporters at his party headquarters in Bangkok. ""We stand by our principle of respecting the party that finishes first and its right to form the government.""

The People's Party was holding down second place with 116 seats.

Going into the polls, analysts had been predicting a close race that was unlikely to yield an outright winner and were anticipating difficult coalition negotiations following the vote.

The vote was held with the country's economy and its vital tourist sector struggling, and amid heightened tensions with neighbor Cambodia that have resulted in deadly clashes along the border.

The country has churned through three prime ministers in under three years since the last general election in 2023.

Thailand, which has seen 13 successful military coups since becoming a constitutional monarchy in 1932, has a long history of political instability.

Ahead of the vote, surveys suggest that the People's Party would win the most votes for the 500-seat lower house.

The People's Party is the successor to the progressive and reformist Move Forward party, which won the last election in 2023.

But Move Forward's candidate for prime minister was blocked, and the party was later dissolved after the Constitutional Court found that its reformist agenda amounted to an attempt to overthrow the monarchy.

The People's Party softened that reformist messaging during the campaign for this election.

Even if the People's Party were to win the most votes on Sunday, analysts say it is unlikely to win enough of a majority to govern.

The other major players are Pheu Thai and conservative Bhumjaithai, led by incumbent Prime Minister Anutin, who is widely expected to retain his job in a coalition deal.

Pheu Thai, which has long dominated Thai politics, has seen its influence decline after Anutin's predecessor, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, was removed from office last year.

Paetongtarn's father, Thaksin, and the political dynasty he leads have shaped Thai politics for more than two decades.

Thaksin, a telecoms tycoon and former prime minister, is currently serving a one-year prison sentence for corruption and abuse of power.

Thais also voted Sunday in a constitutional referendum on whether the current military-backed charter from 2017 should be replaced.

The ballot asked voters if they ""approve that there should be a new constitution,"" with options of ""Yes,"" ""No,"" or ""No opinion.""

The referendum is not an immediate vote on a new constitution. A majority ""Yes"" vote would give parliament a public mandate to start a multi‑stage drafting process that would require two more referendums before a new charter could be adopted.

Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said her priority would be to strengthen the US-Japan alliance. She had called the snap election in January to secure a stronger mandate in parliament.

Japan's nationalist ruling party won a sweeping majority in parliamentary elections on Sunday, projections showed, securing a strong new mandate for Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.

Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is expected to have won about 300 seats in the lower house of parliament, far exceeding the 233 seats required for a majority, national broadcaster NHK reported, basing projections on exit polls.

Together with its coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party (JIP), the LDP was projected to win 310 seats, NHK said, giving them a two-thirds majority.

""We received [voter] backing for Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's responsible, proactive fiscal policies and a strengthening of national defence capabilities,"" LDP secretary general Shunichi Suzuki told media.

Takaichi dissolved parliament in January and called snap elections, a gamble that she hoped would provide her and her struggling party with a stronger footing in parliament going into the new year.

While Takaichi is hugely popular, particularly with younger voters, her conservative LDP, which has ruled the country for most of the past seven decades, has been hit by scandals and faced a new opposition alliance that has emerged as a potential challenger.

After seat projections became clear, Takaichi made a post on X thanking US President Donald Trump for his support.

""I look forward to visiting the White House this spring and to continuing our work together to further strengthen the Japan-US alliance,"" she wrote.

""Our alliance and friendship with the United States of America are built on deep trust and close, strong cooperation. The potential of our alliance is LIMITLESS.""

Trump congratulated Takaichi for her coalition's projected victory in a post on his Truth Social platform.

""Congratulations to Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and her Coalition on a LANDSLIDE Victory,"" Trump said. ""It was my Honor to Endorse you and your Coalition. I wish you Great Success in passing your Conservative, Peace Through Strength Agenda.""

Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te also congratulated Takaichi as the results poured in.

""May your victory bring ‍a more prosperous and secure ​future for Japan and its partners in ⁠the ​region,"" Lai said ‌on social media.

The projections affirm what opinion polls foresaw ahead of Sunday's national elections: that the LDP alone would comfortably win the 233 seats required for a majority in the 465-member lower house of parliament.

Sunday night's projections showed the LDP and its coalition partner, the populist JIP, would most likely surpass the 310 seats needed for a two-thirds majority.

This would allow the coalition to override the upper chamber, which is controlled by the opposition.

That would be the strongest result for the LDP since Takaichi's mentor Shinzo Abe's victory in 2017. Abe, Japan's longest-serving prime minister, was assassinated in 2022.

Such a victory would mean a significant shift to the right in Japanese politics. The LDP, which has held a narrow majority since a poor showing in elections in 2024, has struggled to push through legislation.

Takaichi had said she would step down if the LDP failed to secure a majority.

NHK's projections showed that a newly formed Centrist Reform Alliance and the far-right Sanseito party were unable to pose a serious threat to the incumbent prime minister.

The alliance looked to have lost more than two-thirds of its 167 seats, while the far-right party was projected to have increased its seats from two to between five and 14, broadcaster NHK said.

Takaichi became Japan's first woman prime minister in October.

She has touted UK former-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher — dubbed the ""Iron Lady"" — as an inspiration, and her pledge to ""work, work, work, work and work"" has resonated with voters.

An ultraconservative and China hawk, she wants to boost Japan's defense spending and capabilities amid growing tensions with Beijing and pressure from US President Donald Trump, with whom she enjoys good ties.

She has also been pressing for tougher immigration policies and to revitalize Japan's economy.

The election was held against the backdrop of record snowfall in many areas of the country in recent weeks, which could delay vote counting or hinder access to polling stations in some areas, even in Tokyo.

The snow has blocked roads and has been linked to dozens of deaths.

Iona Cleave is a Foreign Breaking News Reporter at The Telegraph. She covers defence, war and breaking news from across the world, particularly the US, Middle East and Russia-Ukraine war.

A group of Jeffrey Epstein's victims released an advert on Super Bowl Sunday demanding the release of millions of remaining documents related to the late paedophile.

In the clip, which aired just ahead of America's most-watched TV event of the year, eight women called on the public to help press the Trump administration for full transparency.

“After years of being kept apart we're standing together,” the women said, while holding photos of their younger selves at the ages they were abused by Epstein. In unison, they added: “Because we all deserve the truth.”

Earlier this week, Mr Trump – whose second term has been marred by his one-time friendship with Epstein – told Americans it was time to “move on” from the sex offender.

The video's timing may cause a stir, as it was released right before Mr Trump, along with millions of others, tuned-in to watch the Seattle Seahawks battle the New England Patriots in the championship of the National Football League (NFL).

On January 30, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) released three million pages related to their investigation into Epstein, including 2,000 videos and 180,000 images, under the Epstein Files Transparency Act.

However, the DoJ's decision to hold back the other half of the approximate six million files has renewed concerns that some of Epstein's accomplices will not be held accountable and sparked further allegations over a cover-up.

Epstein's victims are leading the calls for the release of the remaining records. Their video ended with a call for the public to “stand with us” and “tell Attorney General Pam Bondi it's time for the truth”.

The DoJ insists that the withheld files either reveal victims' identities, contain child pornography or interfere with ongoing federal investigations.

“We didn't protect or not protect anybody,” Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, said as he announced that the department had “completed” its release of the files.

There are more than 38,000 references to Mr Trump, his wife and his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida across 5,300 of the newly released files.

Epstein died in his New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking charges in a death ruled a suicide.

His longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell was jailed in 2022 and is serving a 20-year prison for her role in helping him recruit underage victims.

Members of Congress will be able to review the un-redacted files on computers at the justice department starting on Monday, according to a letter obtained by NBC News.

The sporting spectacle's half-time show was performed by Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny completely in Spanish, despite fury from inside Maga at both his selection and refusal to bow to their demands to sing in English.

Despite the furore, the rapper wrapped his performance without controversy.

The Latino artist, who has been vocal in his opposition to the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign, instead emphasised unity in a dance-filled spectacle that featured Lady Gaga as a surprise guest.

He finished the show by holding up a football that said: “Together we are America”.

As fireworks exploded around the stadium, a Jumbotron message read: “The only thing more powerful than hate is love.”

The show also featured a young boy hugging Bad Bunny's Grammy Award, which he won three of last week.

The child's involvement is believed to be a reference to five-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos, whose detainment by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Minnesota sparked a national outcry.

After the show, Mr Trump took to Truth Social to criticise the performance, calling it “absolutely terrible”.

Connor Stringer is The Telegraph's Washington Correspondent. He leads coverage of the White House and US politics, reporting on trade, foreign policy and national security. Based in Washington, he has broken a series of world exclusives and covered the defining moments of Donald Trump's administration.

At 22,000ft above the Nevada desert, a rehearsal for war with China plays out in the skies.

Two US Marine F-35 B Lightning fighter jets break the clouds and glide into position alongside an RAF Voyager air-to-air refuelling tanker.

As the jets swallow 70 tonnes of fuel, four British Typhoons appear from below, their canopies glistening in the sun as they wait for their turn to refuel.

In a flash, the American F-35s detach their fuel nozzles from the hose trailing the RAF Voyager, banking hard right and accelerating into the warzone.

The fifth-generation fighters are using state-of-the-art war fighting technology that is so secret that The Telegraph is barred from taking pictures of them.

The manoeuvre, all of which lasts a matter of minutes, plays out like an aerial ballet at 300mph.

This is Exercise Red Flag – the annual wargame where US, British, and Australian pilots face off against each other in a two-week-long simulation aimed at preparing for war. The exercises change over time to reflect the developing threats facing the Western world.

Today, for the first time in the exercise's 51-year-long history, enemy adversaries are flying fifth-generation fighters, in an obvious nod to the threat posed by Chinese Chengdu J-20s and Shenyang J-35s.

“This is where war fighters get to practice advanced warfighting,” says Col Tony May, of the US Air Force, who is responsible for running the live wargame. “At the end of the day, it is about coming together to kick some ass.”

Red Flag, which is held at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, began in 1972 out of the realisation that pilots were not ready for combat when they took to the skies of Vietnam. This year, it brings together 3,000 troops and more than 100 aircraft to push elite fighters to their limits.

Where once the pilot's sights may have been set on taking out insurgents in Afghanistan or Iraq, the 2026 simulation is all about preparing for combat bad-actors with a “high technological capability”.

Teams are split into two. The “Blues”, which represent the allies, go toe-to-toe with the “Reds”, which are manned by pilots who have been trained to adapt the tactics and capabilities of potential adversaries.

Some 12,000 square miles of airspace are turned into a giant “sandbox” which is used to simulate every enemy and mission scenario imaginable in both day and night.

Even the US Marine F-35Bs, which are being flown by the red team for the first time, are adapted to mimic how the Chinese J-35s may perform.

If the hints about who the enemy is weren't clear enough, Operation Bamboo Eagle will follow the mammoth exercise. It moves the action across the eastern Pacific and feature more than 10,000 personnel.

There are also cyber and space-based elements woven into each mission, though officials are tight-lipped on what they are.

“We take all adversary aircraft and we're able to pretend to be them no matter who it is,” says Lt Col Ryan “Chip” Young, commander of the 65th aggressor squadron, which plays the enemy.

“We can change what we look like. I am executing tactics as a person would as an adversary, making mistakes, trying to figure out what the blue side is doing. There's a lot of close and long-range fights.”

The timing of this year's exercise could not be more significant. Beijing has accelerated its military development to historical levels across land, sea, air, and space.

The US's annual report revealed that China expects to be able to fight and win a war on Taiwan by the end of 2027.

Last week, it unveiled plans for a space carrier that can deploy unmanned fighter jets capable of firing missiles from the edge of the Earth's atmosphere.

Such capabilities would give China a significant advantage, including over Taiwan and in the South China Sea, which could be the scene of a future war against the United States.

Under Nevada's winter sun, allied forces are tasked with striking the enemy's critical infrastructure before taking down radar and air defences.

This is where the RAF Voyager, an Airbus A330 fitted with a strengthened airframe and extra fuel tanks, comes in. It was scrambled around 1pm to keep the allied strike force, made up of American and Australian F-35s and British Typhoons, in the air.

The tanker's role is one of the most crucial in modern warfare, allowing the jets to fly longer distances and loiter over targets for longer without having to return to base.

It climbs high and begins a series of loops in the air, far from the hostile red forces, but close enough for its more than 111 tonnes of fuel to keep the allies' aircraft in battle.

In the cockpit, Flt Lt Matt Winwood keeps the tanker steady while systems operator “Wellie” watches the approaching Typhoons on a bank of monitors.

“These are some of the best pilots in the US forces here to train against, and they mean business. It's not easy mode,” Voyager captain Flt Lt Winwood says.

And he is right. Somewhere above us is our escort of fighters whose job it is to watch over the vulnerable Voyager while it carries out the refuelling. An enemy fighter, thought to be a fifth-generation F-35B, gets within 50 miles of the Voyager's “danger zone” – the point at which it must start retreating.

But it is shot down by our guardian. We survive, oblivious to how close the enemy came.

Afterwards, officials debrief and watch a simulated replay of the day's warfare.

“The level of technicality here, and the sheer space here, is absolutely invaluable,” Group Captain Jack Holts, who is responsible for the British deployment for the exercise, says. “That's why we are so keen to train with partners and why training in this kind of environment is very important.”

Each day, the flag above Nellis Air Force base has the winning team's colours flying above the losers. As we arrive back at base, the blue team colours are on top. The Allies are victorious. This time.

“Concealing the reputations of these powerful men is a blatant violation” of federal law, Rep. Ro Khanna said.

Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! 

Several members of Congress are expected this week to review hundreds, if not thousands, of files relating to disgraced financier and accused child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, amid claims that files are being improperly redacted and that victims' names have been wrongly released to the public.

The Epstein Files Transparency Act — which passed last fall after considerable opposition from President Donald Trump, who campaigned to his advantage on releasing the files — required “all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials” in the case to be released two months ago. Yet millions of files have not been released, raising further doubt about the administration's supposed commitment to transparency.

Meanwhile, many of the files within the latest batch of documents to be released improperly  include the names and images of dozens of survivors of Epstein's crimes. Lawyers for the victims say that as many as 100 people have had their lives “turned upside down” as a result of the Department of Justice's (DOJ) impropriety. 

In other examples, it appears that names that were mandated to be made public by the Epstein Transparency Files Act are still being blocked out. The act specifically stipulates that a person's name cannot be redacted to protect them from embarrassment or reputational harm — but multiple names appear to have been redacted for that purpose.

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-California), who co-authored the bipartisan law alongside Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Kentucky), shared an example in which a person sent an email to Epstein describing, in extremely disturbing terms, the attributes of a child who had “just arrived.” The name of the person who sent the email was redacted in the DOJ's latest file release.

“Concealing the reputations of these powerful men is a blatant violation of the Epstein Transparency Act we passed,” Khanna wrote on Facebook.

Massie also expressed his discontent with the administration's actions.

“Where are the rest of the documents? Why did they release victims' names? They took extra time, they said, to be safe, and what are these redactions?” Massie said in a CNN interview this weekend.

Attorney General Pam Bondi “has no credibility on this,” Massie added, noting that Bondi had previously claimed files were on her desk before flipping positions, saying there was nothing new worth making public last year.

Several other members of Congress have complained about these issues. Earlier this month, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Maryland), the ranking Democratic member on the House Judiciary Committee, requested that the DOJ allow him and other lawmakers to view unredacted versions of the files the department has made public. 

“We seek to ensure that your redactions comply with the Act's requirement that materials be withheld only in narrow circumstances, such as protecting victims' personally identifiable information, and not on the basis of “embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary,” Raskin wrote.

The DOJ appears to have relented to that request, allowing lawmakers, starting this week, to view unredacted versions of the files that have been made public. The agreement requires those members of Congress to give the department 24 hours notice. They cannot bring in electronic recording devices, but will be allowed to take handwritten notes while viewing the files.

News of the infections comes less than a week after two cases of measles were identified at another Texas ICE jail.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

Two cases of tuberculosis and 18 cases of COVID-19 were recently identified at a massive immigration detention center in El Paso, according to city officials and a Democratic congresswoman.

El Paso's U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar disclosed the infections after her Friday visit to Camp East Montana, the 5,000-bed tent facility the federal government hastily built last year on the Fort Bliss Army base. In a post on X, Escobar said, “Many of the chronic issues that I have reported out to the public and to members of my committee persist.”

She said medical leadership at the East Montana facility shared that information with her last month in front of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. 

City of El Paso spokesperson Laura Cruz-Acosta also confirmed the cases Saturday, writing in a statement that city health officials “received notifications related to tuberculosis at Camp East Montana through required reporting protocols.” She said that ICE, which oversees the facility, is “required to report notifiable conditions, including confirmed or suspected tuberculosis.” Texas state law mandates such reporting to local and state officials. But ICE is responsible for diagnosing, treating and managing tuberculosis and other diseases while immigrants remain in federal custody.

Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, and other ICE spokespeople did not respond to detailed questions Saturday. More than 24 hours later, McLaughlin denied in a statement that tuberculosis cases are currently present at the tent camp. 

“There are no cases of tuberculosis at the El Paso ICE facility,” she said, offering no further details.

McLaughlin and other ICE spokespeople did not explain when the tuberculosis and COVID cases were first reported and what happened to the people Escobar and city officials said had been diagnosed with the illnesses last month. Federal officials also have not disclosed how many tuberculosis and other infectious diseases have been reported at the facility since the beginning of the year, if the facility had been placed on lockdown, whether people were quarantined as a result and what actions the government took.

“It is a longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody,” McLaughlin said, adding that includes medical, dental and mental health screening. “This is the best healthcare many aliens have received their entire lives.”

Cruz-Acosta, the city's spokesperson, later wrote in a Sunday afternoon statement that the individuals with tuberculosis were “evaluated and treated by ICE and its contracted medical providers, and are no longer housed at the detention facility.” Cruz-Acosta added that she doesn't have any information about the COVID-19 cases because those are not reported to the city.

Around 3,100 people were being detained at the facility at the end of January, including 325 women, and “around one-third of detainees have a chronic illness and around 200 to 300 detainees require daily insulin,” Escobar said.

News of the infections comes less than a week after two cases of measles were identified at the South Texas Family Residential Center. The immigration detention center is 70 miles south of San Antonio and the only facility in the country currently holding parents with their children. It was placed on a lockdown on Feb. 2.

The cases of tuberculosis and COVID-19, two diseases that spread through the air, have underscored concern about the conditions at Camp East Montana and other immigration detention centers.

Immigration rights organizations have been warning about Camp East Montana's “inhumane conditions,” citing physical abuse and alarming medical neglect.

In the troubled facility's first six months of operation, three migrants have died — one being Geraldo Lunas Campos, who ICE initially said died after “experiencing medical distress.” About a week later, ICE told the Associated Press that he died during a suicide attempt after staff attempted to save him.

The El Paso Medical Examiner's autopsy report, released on Jan. 21, ruled Lunas Campos' death was a homicide, after there was so much pressure on his neck and chest that he couldn't breathe. Local and federal officials have not said whether they would seek criminal charges in the matter, which remains under internal investigation by ICE.

“What is absolutely clear is that the private company running this immigration detention facility is getting worse, not better,” Escobar said of Acquisition Logistics LLC, a small Virginia-based business with no listed experience running a correction facility.

Camp East Montana is the country's largest immigration detention center, but the Department of Homeland Security is looking to build at least two others in El Paso County and the Dallas area that may hold up to 9,500 people each.

“Public health officers are being asked to facilitate a man-made humanitarian crisis,” said one nurse who resigned.

Rebekah Stewart, a nurse at the U.S. Public Health Service, got a call last April that brought her to tears. She had been selected for deployment to the Trump administration's new immigration detention operation at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.

This posting combined Donald Trump's longtime passion to use the offshore base to move “some bad dudes” out of the United States with a promise made shortly after his inauguration last year to hold thousands of noncitizens there. The naval base is known for the torture and inhumane treatment of men suspected of terrorism in the wake of 9/11.

“Deployments are typically not something you can say no to,” Stewart said. She pleaded with the coordinating office, which found another nurse to go in her place.

Other public health officers who worked at Guantánamo in the past year described conditions there for the detainees, some of whom learned they were in Cuba from the nurses and doctors sent to care for them. They treated immigrants detained in a dark prison called Camp 6, where no sunlight filters in, said the officers, whom KFF Health News agreed not to name because they fear retaliation for speaking publicly. It previously held people with suspected ties to al-Qaida. The officers said they were not briefed ahead of time on the details of their potential duties at the base.

Although the Public Health Service is not a branch of the U.S. armed forces, its uniformed officers — roughly 5,000 doctors, nurses, and other health workers — act like stethoscope-wearing soldiers in emergencies. The government deploys them during hurricanes, wildfires, mass shootings, and measles outbreaks. In the interim, they fill gaps at an alphabet soup of government agencies.

The Trump administration's mass arrests to curb immigration have created a new type of health emergency as the number of people detained reaches record highs. About 71,000 immigrants are currently imprisoned, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement data, which shows that most have no criminal record.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has said: “President Donald Trump has been very clear: Guantanamo Bay will hold the worst of the worst.” However, several news organizations have reported that many of the men shipped to the base had no criminal convictions. As many as 90% of them were described as “low-risk” in a May progress report from ICE.

In fits and starts, the Trump administration has sent about 780 noncitizens to Guantánamo Bay, according to The New York Times. Numbers fluctuate as new detainees arrive and others are returned to the U.S. or deported.

While some Public Health Service officers have provided medical care to detained immigrants in the past, this is the first time in American history that Guantánamo has been used to house immigrants who had been living in the U.S. Officers said ICE postings are getting more common. After dodging Guantánamo, Stewart was instructed to report to an ICE detention center in Texas.

“Public health officers are being asked to facilitate a man-made humanitarian crisis,” she said.

Seeing no option to refuse deployments that she found objectionable, Stewart resigned after a decade of service. She would give up the prospect of a pension offered after 20 years.

“It was one of the hardest decisions I ever had to make,” she said. “It was my dream job.”

One of her PHS colleagues, nurse Dena Bushman, grappled with a similar moral dilemma when she got a notice to report to Guantánamo a few weeks after the shooting at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in August. Bushman, who was posted with the CDC, got a medical waiver delaying her deployment on account of stress and grief. She considered resigning, then did.

“This may sound extreme,” Bushman said. “But when I was making this decision, I couldn't help but think about how the people who fed those imprisoned in concentration camps were still part of the Nazi regime.”

Others have resigned, but many officers remain. While they are alarmed by Trump's tactics, detained people need care, multiple PHS officers told KFF Health News.

“We do the best we can to provide care to people in this shit show,” said a PHS nurse who worked in detention facilities last year.

“I respect people and treat them like humans,” she said. “I try to be a light in the darkness, the one person that makes someone smile in this horrible mess.”

The PHS officers conceded that their power to protect people was limited in a detention system fraught with overcrowding, disorganization, and the psychological trauma of uncertainty, family separations, and sleep deprivation.

“Ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE,” said Tricia McLaughlin, chief spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, in an emailed statement to KFF Health News.

Adm. Brian Christine, assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the Public Health Service, said in an email: “Our duty is clear: say “Yes Sir!”, salute smartly, and execute the mission: show up, provide humane care, and protect health.” Christine is a recent appointee who, until recently, was a urologist specializing in testosterone and male fertility issues.

“In pursuit of subjective morality or public displays of virtue,” he added, “we risk abandoning the very individuals we pledged to serve.”

In the months before Stewart resigned, she reflected on her previous deployments, during Trump's first term, to immigration processing centers run by Customs and Border Protection. Fifty women were held in a single concrete cell in Texas, she recalled.

“The most impactful thing I could do was to convince the guards to allow the women, who had been in there for a week, to shower,” she said. “I witnessed suffering without having much ability to address it.”

Stewart spoke with Bushman and other PHS officers who were embedded at the CDC last year. They assisted with the agency's response to ongoing measles outbreaks, with sexually transmitted infection research, and more. Their roles became crucial last year as the Trump administration laid off droves of CDC staffers.

Stewart, Bushman, and a few other PHS officers at the CDC said they met with middle managers to ask for details about the deployments: If they went to Guantánamo and ICE facilities, how much power would they have to provide what they considered medically necessary care? If they saw anything unethical, how could they report it? Would it be investigated? Would they be protected from reprisal?

Stewart and Bushman said they were given a PHS office phone number they could call if they had a complaint while on assignment. Otherwise, they said, their questions went unanswered. They resigned and so never went to Guantánamo.

PHS officers who were deployed to the base told KFF Health News they weren't given details about their potential duties — or the standard operating procedure for medical care — before they arrived.

Stephen Xenakis, a retired Army general and a psychiatrist who has advised on medical care at Guantánamo for two decades, said that was troubling. Before health workers deploy, he said, they should understand what they'll be expected to do.

The consequences of insufficient preparation can be severe. In 2014, the Navy threatened to court-martial one of its nurses at Guantánamo who refused to force-feed prisoners on hunger strike, who were protesting inhumane treatment and indefinite detention. The protocol was brutal: A person was shackled to a five-point restraint chair as nurses shoved a tube for liquid food into their stomach through their nostrils.

“He wasn't given clear guidance in advance on how these procedures would be conducted at Guantánamo,” Xenakis said of the nurse. “Until he saw it, he didn't understand how painful it was for detainees.”

The American Nurses Association and Physicians for Human Rights sided with the nurse, saying his objection was guided by professional ethics. After a year, the military dropped the charges.

A uniformed doctor or nurse's power tends to depend on their rank, their supervisor, and chains of command, Xenakis said. He helped put an end to some inhumane practices at Guantánamo more than a decade ago, when he and other retired generals and admirals publicly objected to certain interrogation techniques, such as one called “walling,” in which interrogators slammed the heads of detainees suspected of terrorism against a wall, causing slight concussions. Xenakis argued that science didn't support “walling” as an effective means of interrogation, and that it was unethical, amounting to torture.

Torture hasn't been reported from Guantánamo's immigration operation, but ICE shift reports obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by the government watchdog group American Oversight note concerns about detainees resorting to hunger strikes and self-harm.

“Welfare checks with potential hunger strike IA's,” short for illegal aliens, says an April 30 note from a contractor working with ICE. “In case of a hunger strike or other emergencies,” the report adds, the PHS and ICE are “coordinating policies and procedures.”

“De-escalation of potential pod wide hunger strike/potential riot,” says an entry from July 8. “Speak with alien on suicide watch regarding well being.”

Inmates and investigations have reported delayed medical care at immigration detention facilities and dangerous conditions, including overcrowding and a lack of sanitation. Thirty-two people died in ICE custody in 2025, making it the deadliest year in two decades.

“They are arresting and detaining more people than their facilities can support,” one PHS officer told KFF Health News. The most prevalent problem the officer saw among imprisoned immigrants was psychological. They worried about never seeing their families again or being sent back to a country where they feared they'd be killed. “People are scared out of their minds,” the officer said.

The PHS officers who were at Guantánamo told KFF Health News that the men they saw were detained in either low-security barracks, with a handful of people per room, or in Camp 6, a dark, high-security facility without natural light. The ICE shift reports describe the two stations by their position on the island, Leeward for the barracks and Windward for Camp 6. About 50 Cuban men sent to Guantánamo in December and January have languished at Camp 6.

A Navy hospital on the base mainly serves the military and other residents who aren't locked up — and in any case, its capabilities are limited, the officers said. To reduce the chance of expensive medical evacuations back to the U.S. to see specialists quickly, they said, the immigrants were screened before being shipped to Guantánamo. People over age 60 or who needed daily drugs to manage diabetes and high blood pressure, for example, were generally excluded. Still, the officers said, some detainees have had to be evacuated back to Florida.

PHS nurses and doctors said they screened immigrants again when they arrived and provided ongoing care, fielding complaints including about gastrointestinal distress and depression. One ICE monthly progress report says, “The USPHS psychologist started an exercise group” for detainees.

Doctors' requests for lab work were often turned down because of logistical hurdles, partly due to the number of agencies working together on the base, the officers said. Even a routine test, a complete blood count, took weeks to process, versus hours in the U.S.

DHS and the Department of Defense, which have coordinated on the Guantánamo immigration operation, did not respond to requests for comment about their work there.

One PHS officer who helped medically screen new detainees said they were often surprised to learn they were at Guantánamo.

“I'd tell them, ‘I'm sorry you are here,'” the officer said. “No one freaked out. It was like the ten-millionth time they had been transferred.” Some of the men had been detained in various facilities for five or six months and said they wanted to return to their home countries, according to the officer. Health workers had neither an answer nor a fix.

Unlike ICE detention facilities in the U.S., Guantánamo hasn't been overcrowded. “I have never been so not busy at work,” one officer said. A military base on a tropical island, Guantánamo offers activities such as snorkeling, paddleboard yoga, and kickboxing to those who aren't imprisoned. Even so, the officer said they would rather be home than on this assignment on the taxpayer's dime.

Transporting staff and supplies to the island and maintaining them on-base is enormously expensive. The government paid an estimated $16,500 per day, per detainee at Guantánamo, to hold those accused of terrorism, according to a 2025 Washington Post analysis of DOD data. (The average cost to detain immigrants in ICE facilities in the U.S. is $157 a day.)

Even so, the funding has skyrocketed: Congress granted ICE a record $78 billion for fiscal year 2026, a staggering increase from $9.9 billion in 2024 and $6.5 billion nearly a decade ago.

Last year, the Trump administration also diverted more than $2 billion from the national defense budget to immigration operations, according to a report from congressional Democrats. About $60 million of it went to Guantánamo.

“Detaining noncitizens at Guantanamo is far more costly and logistically burdensome than holding them in ICE detention facilities within the United States,” wrote Deborah Fleischaker, a former assistant director at ICE, in a declaration submitted as part of a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union early last year. In December, a federal judge rejected the Trump administration's request to dismiss a separate ACLU case questioning the legality of detaining immigrants outside the U.S.

Anne Schuchat, who served with the PHS for 30 years before retiring in 2018, said PHS deployments to detention centers may cost the nation in terms of security, too. “A key concern has always been to have enough of these officers available for public health emergencies,” she said.

Andrew Nixon, an HHS spokesperson, said the immigration deployments don't affect the public health service's potential response to other emergencies.

In the past, PHS officers have stood up medical shelters during hurricanes in Louisiana and Texas, rolled out covid testing in the earliest months of the pandemic, and provided crisis support after the deadly shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School and the Boston Marathon bombing.

“It's important for the public to be aware of how many government resources are being used so that the current administration can carry out this one agenda,” said Stewart, one of the nurses who resigned. “This one thing that's probably turning us into the types of countries we have fought wars against.”

 And It's Hurting China and the Rest of the World

 Dinny McMahon

When China's property market collapsed in 2021, its leaders scrambled to find a new driver of economic growth to replace housing construction. More investment in infrastructure, which had powered much of the country's boom for decades, wasn't an option: the population was peaking, and a collapse in land sales meant that local authorities lacked the funds to spend on new airports and eight-lane highways. Nor could Beijing rely on more exports. China was already the world's biggest exporter, and with labor and land costs rising the world's factory no longer had as significant a cost advantage for cheap goods.

That left consumption. Economists have long noted that household consumption in China contributes relatively little to economic activity compared with other countries. In 2024, according to World Bank data, consumption was only 40 percent of China's GDP, about 20 percentage points below the global average. A policy focused on lifting household spending to the level of South Korea (48 percent) or Japan (55 percent in 2022) could drive growth for decades.

In reality, however, China isn't rebalancing its economy toward consumption. That's not to say it doesn't want more consumption. It does. Leaders in Beijing have publicly endorsed the need to raise consumption: in February 2025, for instance, Chinese premier Li Qiang called for “boosting consumption to expand domestic demand, smooth the economic cycle, and drive economic growth.” But China's leaders envision higher consumption coming at the end of China's economic transition, not the beginning. Rather than redistributing wealth so people can spend more now, Beijing wants to focus on creating new wealth in the hope that it spurs greater consumption in the future.

In the long term, this approach may lead to a more balanced growth model. But in the face of weak domestic demand from the aftermath of the deflated property bubble, China is ramping up its exports even more in the short term. This not only delays China's own pivot toward consumption; it also promises wealth destruction for other countries trying to compete with China or find their place in the global economy.

For consumption to lead China's economy, the country's famously frugal savers must set aside less of their income, or incomes must increase faster than the economy as a whole. Engineering that kind of transformation requires wealth redistribution.

When advanced industrial economies redistribute wealth, they typically do it by raising the minimum wage, cutting personal income tax rates, handing out stimulus checks, increasing welfare payments, or cutting mortgage rates. China has taken some of these steps. In 2023 and again in 2024, for instance, the People's Bank of China forced banks to dramatically cut the interest rate on existing mortgages, reducing households' annual interest payments by about $43 billion. Provincial governments raise the minimum wage every year. And, starting in 2023, regulators have pushed listed companies to pay dividends to shareholders, something they've traditionally been reluctant to do.

But Beijing has steadfastly refused to do the one thing that might make the biggest difference: significantly expand the social safety net. China's system of social supports is chronically underfunded. The national social security fund, which backstops the country's pensions, is likely to be depleted by 2035, throwing into doubt the retirement of tens of millions of people. Although nearly all of China's citizens have some basic health insurance, low reimbursement rates mean that out-of-pocket health-care costs can be debilitating, particularly for families supporting elderly parents. And many of the 300 million people who have migrated from the countryside to the cities to work cannot access subsidized public services because they're only registered to access services in their hometowns, where quality is often much lower. The government says that it supports granting internal migrants the residency status they need to allow them the same access to affordable housing, public schooling, health care, and pensions as their urban neighbors, but it has been unwilling to fund it.

Observers often point to Chinese leader Xi Jinping's stated aversion to “welfarism”—his reluctance to seeing “‘lazy people' get something for nothing,” as he wrote in 2021—as the reason for this lack of spending. But the bigger sticking point is party leaders' insistence that social programs be “within the means” of the state to fund them.



As most countries do, China runs a budget deficit. In 2025 the government set the deficit target at four percent, the highest level in three decades. Any expansion of social supports, therefore, would have to be funded with debt. Chinese officials and academics, however, have long worried that debt-funded social programs could lead to what they call “Latin Americanization”—how the growth of vibrant Latin American economies such as Argentina and Brazil stalled in the 1970s and 1980s after populist governments in these countries tried to build Western-style welfare systems on the back of developing economies. In a 2021 essay in the party's main theory journal, Xi explained that when “some Latin American countries engaged in populism,” the resulting lack of fiscal discipline condemned them to the middle-income trap and prevented them from catching up to advanced economies such as the United States and the European Union.

China's rapidly aging population makes this fear even greater. China's old-age dependency ratio—the number of retirees as a share of the working-age population—will match that of the United States in 2035, and the EU in 2046. By 2080, China will have more retirees than workers. This has major consequences for the economy: as a population ages, the burden on the state increases as pensions, health-care spending, and other costs rise. Meanwhile, as the size of the workforce shrinks, so does the pool of taxpayers, making it harder for the state to cover its rising expenses.

Beijing is not afraid to borrow; after all, it allowed local government to rack up huge debts to fund infrastructure. The difference is that it sees infrastructure as an investment. Even if infrastructure doesn't pay for itself, it can nonetheless create new wealth and value. By contrast, Beijing sees social spending as a recurring expense and an endless burden. In the words of Xi, “Welfare benefits cannot be reduced once they have gone up.” If China is going to boost social welfare, it will do it incrementally—not at the level that would meaningfully rebalance the economy toward consumption. Instead, if China's leaders are going to borrow and spend, they want that money to address the most important challenge they are facing: moving up the economic value chain.

For decades, Beijing's overriding economic preoccupation was the pace of growth. Economic growth is still important—Xi wants GDP per capita to double between 2020 and 2035—but it's no longer enough. Xi now speaks of the need for “high quality” growth, or growth that will help transform China's economy so it can avoid the middle-income trap, mitigate the effects of a rapidly aging population, and deliver Xi's promise of “common prosperity,” in which China is more affluent and equitable.

To manage this confluence of goals, Beijing needs an economy capable of producing higher-value goods that can't be cheaply replicated by developing economies with lower labor costs. This will require China to innovate and improve its advanced manufacturing sectors. China also needs to boost tax revenue sufficiently to cover the expanding needs of retirees without overburdening the shrinking workforce. This means that incomes need to rise high enough that even with a heavier tax burden, working people are still better off. And to realize “common prosperity” without massive redistribution, China needs to find ways to produce enough wealth to enlarge the middle class and, eventually, boost consumption by dividing the new gains more fairly.

To achieve all of this, Beijing has embraced what it calls “new quality productive forces.” In this model, productivity gains are the core of growth, and Chinese leaders intend to use innovation and industrial upgrading to concentrate these gains in manufacturing. The hope is that by developing their own proprietary technology, Chinese firms will be able to lead emerging industries as varied as biotechnology and electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles (better known as flying cars), which will, in turn, allow them to generate higher profit margins than when they were merely producing low-cost knockoffs of existing technologies.



Beijing is thus engaged in a top-to-bottom effort to generate scientific breakthroughs and industrial innovations that can be commercialized and sold. What that looks like depends on the industry, but it often includes tax exemptions, public investment in infrastructure, funding for R & D, government procurement, and consumer subsidies. In the electric vehicles sector, for instance, all of these policies have helped make China the undisputed global leader.

But Beijing also wants to hold on to old industries. Rather than let traditional labor-intensive industries such as textiles and toy manufacturing decamp to developing countries in search of ever-cheaper labor, policymakers are striving to keep these industries in China by deploying robots, industrial software, and artificial intelligence to reduce production costs and raise profit margins. China's advanced firms can produce the technology that allows its low-end industries to remain competitive. This strategy has the added benefit of creating domestic demand for China's high-end engineering and machinery firms. And even though such industrial transformation eliminates some blue-collar jobs—jobs that were likely to migrate overseas to lower-cost destinations—it creates new “purple-collar” jobs for skilled technicians that pay more than traditional assembly line positions.

But Beijing is hoping the biggest employment gains from China's shift to advanced manufacturing will be white-collar professional jobs. Take the example of Apple. Apple outsources all of its manufacturing, yet the company still employs 90,000 people in the United States alone. These include engineers, researchers, software developers, product designers, supply chain managers, salespeople, market researchers, marketers, lobbyists, and intellectual property lawyers—in other words, well-paid white-collar employees. Beijing wants companies in its own high-end industries to provide these kinds of good jobs for the tens of millions of young college graduates in China.

By focusing on innovation and industrial upgrading, Beijing hopes to create firms capable of generating higher profits and paying higher salaries. Bigger salaries and profits will translate into an expanded tax base for the state, which can then spend more on social supports for an aging population. More profitable companies will also lift the stock market, which will replace an oversaturated property sector as the engine of middle-class wealth creation. In this more affluent, equitable China of the future, people will—finally—be able to consume at far higher levels than they do today.

But that vision is not only long term; it also contains a paradox. Holding on to old industries while expanding into new ones means that China's industrial production will continue to grow. As incomes rise, however, people typically spend a greater share of what they earn on services and less on physical goods. Even if Chinese households do buy some more manufactured items, they cannot possibly absorb all of China's massive increase in industrial production. The rest of the world will be asked to fill the gap.

According to the United Nations, China accounted for 27 percent of global industrial output in 2023. No country has dominated global production to this degree since the United States in the immediate aftermath of World War II, when many of the world's economies lay in ruin. The UN projects that, given current trends, China's share will rise to 45 percent by 2030. Regardless of the exact percentage, countries around the world are unlikely to tolerate a rising tide of cheap, high-quality, and increasingly innovative Chinese goods overwhelming their domestic markets.



Advanced industrialized countries will bear the brunt of China's revved-up export engine. Countries such as Germany, which is a major producer of cars, chemicals, and industrial machinery, face a future in which demand for their products drops and their global market share will be taken over by Chinese competitors. Developing countries face challenges, as well. As China produces low-end goods ever more efficiently, it cuts off economies with lower labor costs from embarking on the path to prosperity that China itself once trod.

The great irony is that while China's new growth model threatens the prosperity of other countries, it might not deliver the desired returns at home. For China's economic model to be a success, it must deliver higher profits, salaries, and tax revenue. But in the first half of 2025, China's real GDP grew by 5.3 percent, according to government statistics, yet tax revenue declined by 1.2 percent. Part of the problem is industrial overcapacity: China's firms have built factories capable of producing goods far in excess of demand, which has driven down prices, destroyed profits, reduced taxes, dampened wage growth, and created uncertainty for workers. If Beijing can't reverse this overcapacity, it will struggle to deliver prosperity in the face of demographic decline.

Economists both in China and around the world continue to call for China to pivot to consumption-led growth fueled by wealth redistribution. It seems like the very definition of a win-win proposition: the Chinese public would be better off, and China would import more from the rest of the world. But Beijing is moving in the opposite direction. Increasingly, the only things that China needs from abroad are commodities, luxury items, overseas holidays, and a handful of high-tech goods it isn't yet able to make for itself. As Chinese leaders say, they want to ensure that the economic cake gets bigger before they divide it more fairly. But it remains to be seen if they can have their cake and eat it, too.

 Only Collective Defense Can Protect the Continent

 Max Bergmann

The transatlantic alliance is on the ropes. Since the end of World War II, American power has underwritten European unification and integration—arguably Washington's greatest foreign policy accomplishment. But the Trump administration has made clear that the United States is no longer interested in acting as Europe's security guarantor. It has threatened to seize the territory of a NATO member, reduced funding to Ukraine, aggressively imposed tariffs on European allies, and, in its 2025 National Security Strategy, called for “cultivating resistance to Europe's current trajectory.” The message could not be clearer: the continent can no longer rely on the United States to defend it. For the first time in eight decades, Europe stands alone.

European states now find themselves vulnerable to Russian aggression. Should Moscow turn its attention beyond Ukraine and rebuild its war machine, it could quickly threaten eastern Europe. Such a danger should spur European leaders to embark on a bold new course of action to solidify their defenses. But there has been no such revolution in European military affairs. Although NATO countries have agreed to increase defense spending to 3.5 percent of GDP by 2035, they cannot spend their way to security. The issue is structural, not financial. European militaries are not set up to defend the continent without the United States.

European leaders are keenly aware of their security dependence but in denial about what must be done. The biggest stumbling block is the belief that defense is a national responsibility rather than a European one. Individual governments across Europe want to retain sovereignty over their militaries and have been reluctant to Europeanize their defense efforts. But this focus on national sovereignty overlooks a deeper reality: European countries are not and have not been sovereign in defense since the end of World War II. They have relied on the United States, a foreign power, to protect them. Now, with that foreign power abandoning them, the most effective way European states can defend themselves without Washington's backing is to integrate their defense efforts. They need to do what they would in any other crisis: activate the European Union. It is time for the EU to become Europe's Pentagon.

This is not the first time that a defenseless Europe has faced a United States wanting to retreat to its own shores. In the late 1940s, Washington found itself trapped: its overriding priority was to bring American troops home from World War II, but Western European countries were still too weak to defend themselves, and the Soviet threat was too severe for Americans to leave without risking that the continent would fall under communist rule.

Washington's preferred solution was not NATO, which, according to the historian Sten Rynning, U.S. officials considered a “holding measure until Europe's condition improved.” The larger goal was to build a united Europe into a “third force” that could counter the Soviet Union without needing to rely on the United States. The “first step in the federation of Europe,” as French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman proposed in an address in May 1950, was the establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community, which would reconcile France and Germany and integrate the industries necessary to wage war. Reconciliation was the starting point, but the ultimate aim was to revitalize European power. This project eventually became the European Community, the precursor to the European Union.

When North Korea invaded South Korea in June 1950, just a month after Schuman's speech, the United States was suddenly pulled into a war in the Indo-Pacific. With U.S. forces stretched thin, the prospect of a Soviet invasion of Europe became very real. In response, and to accelerate Europe's federation, French Prime Minister René Pleven proposed the creation of a European army. If Western Europe were strong enough to deter the Soviet Union, the argument went, it would allow the United States to pull back its military presence from the continent. With strong backing from the Truman administration and U.S. General Dwight Eisenhower, then NATO's supreme allied commander, six Western European countries—Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands—signed a treaty in May 1952 to create a common army with a shared budget, governing council, consultative assembly, and court. But the plan never took off. Despite the idea's French origins, the French parliament blocked ratification of the treaty in 1954 after General Charles de Gaulle decried the prospect of ceding French sovereignty. Much to the chagrin of both the Gaullists and the Eisenhower administration, U.S. troops remained in Europe indefinitely.



The result was that Europe never needed to federate militarily. NATO gave European countries the illusion of sovereign control over national defense. Officially, all NATO states had an equal say in the North Atlantic Council, the alliance's decision-making body, and maintained their own independent militaries. But the United States was the one that called the shots. If a war erupted, every European leader knew the United States would handle it.

After the Iron Curtain collapsed, the European Community transitioned into the European Union. The 1993 Maastricht Treaty, signed by 12 European states, established the Common Foreign and Security Policy, a new pillar dedicated to shared defense. By that point, however, the United States had decided it did not want to leave Europe. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright insisted in 1998 that there should be no “decoupling” or “duplication” between the EU and NATO because it would undermine the primacy of the United States in the transatlantic alliance. The EU was not to do defense; that was Washington's job. The EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy has thus largely sat dormant.

Europe is back where it was in the early 1950s, facing a predatory Russia while the United States rushes for the exits. Europe must now assume that it has to defend itself without American support. This challenge is surmountable but requires more than merely boosting defense budgets. The continent is home to roughly 30 distinct militaries, which operate at varying levels of readiness and capability and use their own equipment. If Russia were to amass troops on the border of a Baltic state, all of Europe's disparate forces would need to rapidly deploy and seamlessly fight together.

In theory, NATO coordinates these moving parts. But a NATO without the United States would be a hollow shell. When the alliance mobilized European forces in Afghanistan, the Balkans, and Libya, for instance, U.S. military prowess masked the inadequacies of those European missions. Europe's armies lack sufficient materiel, such as airtankers, airlifters, and advanced surveillance and targeting technology. The capacity gap is baked in: European militaries were designed to serve as auxiliaries in a U.S.-led NATO war effort.



A U.S. retreat most concerns the European states bordering Russia—understandably so. Frontline states such as Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland have pleaded for other European states to spend more, but marginal increases in national defense spending will not turn their militaries into a cohesive fighting force. It is also unlikely that most European states will meet their pledge to NATO to raise defense spending to 3.5 percent of GDP because such policies are often unpopular domestically. Many citizens of nonfrontline states see their national militaries as tangential to deterring Russia and do not believe they are up to the task. A pan-European poll conducted by Le Grand Continent in early 2025 showed that although a majority feared the outbreak of a conflict, only 19 percent of respondents were confident that their national armies could defend them—compared with 60 percent who felt confident in a hypothetical common European army. Europeans don't want good money going to bad militaries.

Nor can any of Europe's traditional powers effectively oppose Russian aggression on their own. France and the United Kingdom have major budget deficits, leaving them low on funds to ramp up already overstretched militaries. Moreover, years of austerity have ground down the British army: the United Kingdom would struggle to deploy even 25,000 troops to eastern Europe today. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has begun investing massively in defense, and Berlin has the scale to serve as Europe's military backbone, but the country's postwar history of pacifism and aversion to military power makes relying on a German military revival a risky bet.

As a result, Europeans have increasingly embraced ad hoc regional groupings. Despite decades of decrying any duplication with NATO, a flurry of minilateral frameworks have emerged that do just that. The Joint Expeditionary Force, a British-led military partnership designed for rapid reaction to crises, has its own command headquarters in London. As does the French-led “coalition of the willing” for Ukraine, in Paris. Nordic states are also increasingly integrating their military efforts. These arrangements are useful, but not if they sap the drive for a larger collective European effort.

The European Union—with its 450 million people and an economy roughly the size of China's—has the size, scale, and wealth to defend itself, but it is failing to leverage its advantages. Europeans need to relinquish the primacy of national sovereignty and integrate their efforts. The most pragmatic and effective means of achieving European collective security is by empowering the European Union on defense.

European leaders tend to blame “Brussels bureaucrats” when something—anything—goes wrong. The EU is far from perfect, of course. But at its core, it is Europe's vessel for pooling sovereignty and uniting Europe. It has decades of experience integrating Europe's commercial and industrial sectors and harmonizing policy. Unlike individual state governments, the EU focuses on advancing common interests rather than just national ones.

The EU is also where Europe turns in times of crisis, and it has proved it can act. When saboteurs destroyed the Nord Stream gas pipelines in 2022 and Europe was plunged into an energy crisis, for instance, the EU stepped in to coordinate energy policy. When COVID-19 struck in 2020, the EU purchased hundreds of millions of vaccines for the citizens of its member states, even though health policy was strictly a “national competency.” And following the 2015 migration crisis, when more than a million refugees sought to enter Europe, Brussels recruited a border service of 10,000 armed guards. The EU functions as Europeans need—and now they need it for defense.



More important, European citizens want the EU to do defense. The EU is the continent's most trusted governing institution, more so than any member state. According to a 2025 Eurobarometer survey, roughly 80 percent of Europeans worry about the EU's security over the next five years and support a common defense and security policy. The center-right European People's Party, the largest party in the European Parliament, supported a pan-European military during its successful 2024 election campaign. Rob Jetten, the incoming Dutch prime minister, said during his October 2025 campaign that he wanted to give “the EU the power and the resources to do what citizens all across Europe are asking it to do: defend our territory against Putin's aggression.”

The main obstacle is bureaucratic, not political. Europe's national defense ministries deeply oppose ceding control. If Brussels handled military acquisitions, the EU's 27 defense ministries would no longer need their own bloated procurement offices. National defense companies would lose their privileged contracts. In the 1980s, problems of national bureaucratic bloat, corporate state capture, and protectionism led British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to champion the Single European Act to integrate the European market, which led to major efficiency gains and cost savings across the continent in exchange for strengthening Brussels. The same gains—and the same tradeoff—would occur in the defense industry from EU integration today.

Few European political leaders today have called for such a trade. But with more money needed for the military, there will be less for social spending initiatives. Are European leaders prepared to trade butter for guns just to appease their defense ministers? The EU would need a sizable defense budget, funded through member-state contributions, joint borrowing, or the removal of restrictions on Brussels's ability to raise revenue. But Europe does not need to spend as much as the United States does on its military to deter Russia. Pooling funds for joint procurement would spread the spending burden across the continent, strengthen Europe's defense industrial base, and help streamline Europe's militaries. According to a study from the think tank Bruegel, it would create enormous economies of scale that could reduce rearmament costs by half.

Empowering the EU on defense would not spell the end of NATO or national militaries. The EU's focus would be on funding and organizing European troops—that is, serving as Europe's Pentagon. Brussels would merge many of the functions of national procurement offices and manage major acquisitions, as well as integrate and regulate its 27 member states' defense industrial sectors. NATO, ideally, would remain Europe's combatant command, coordinating and executing missions. The alliance, however, should be increasingly Europeanized. With U.S. interest in NATO declining, Europeans should propose to take over top posts, including supreme allied commander, which has always been held by an American. National militaries, especially those of frontline states and traditional military powers, would still serve as the crux of Europe's defense. But these forces would be Europeanized and augmented by the EU.

Brussels could also create a rapid-response force made up of troops from nonfrontline states. Italy and Spain could lead the force because each has a standing army more than 100,000 strong. If they stationed troops to the east of the Pyrenees and north of the Alps and integrated them with other small nonfrontline armies, the EU could form a permanent force able to react quickly to a Russian attack, filling the role imagined for U.S. ground forces in Europe. Since NATO and EU membership already obligates European militaries to fight together in war, it makes sense to integrate now, before war hits. Mobilizing troops into a rapid-response force would also give all countries an opportunity to demonstrate solidarity with frontline states and do more for their security. The EU would manage, fund, and equip this force but could make it available for NATO to command in the event of a war, as originally envisioned in the treaty for a common army signed in 1952.



Integrating defense also requires integrating European foreign policy. Europe needs to be able speak with one voice—something the proliferation of ad hoc regional groupings complicates. One solution, put forth last month by Andrius Kubilius, the European commissioner for defense and space, is a European Security Council comprising select countries, including the United Kingdom, as well as the EU and NATO, to reduce fragmentation and strengthen collective defense. Europe also needs to be more proactive in intelligence sharing, a role that in the past has largely been played by the United States. But just as the EU created Europol to coordinate cross-border law enforcement and counterterrorism operations, Europe could create an “EU service for intelligence cooperation,” as a European Commission report highlighted in October 2024, to fill this gap.

These reforms are compatible with the EU's existing underlying treaty, which includes its Common Foreign and Security Policy. When constraints arise—for example, if illiberal Hungary objects—the EU could find workarounds such as creating new institutional structures that do not include all EU members, similar to how not all EU states use the euro or participate in the Schengen area, which permits freedom of movement across national borders.

Europeans would do well to remember why they joined into a European Union in the first place. Although reluctant to give up sovereignty to a federal authority, Europe's small states realized that they would not survive on their own. They were stronger together, and they needed to work with one another to protect themselves as countries. As the historian Alan Milward observed, far from eliminating each country, the European Community was “its buttress, an indispensable part of the nation-state's post-war reconstruction.” With the United States in retreat, Europe's nation-states are under threat. By activating what the European project was created to do—build the continent's power—European countries can secure their future.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Trump's push to audit voter rolls is already snaring US citizens","https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/09/politics/trump-voter-roll-audit-push","Mon, 09 Feb 2026 11:00:46 GMT","


            Sofia Minotti was surprised to receive a letter last October from her local elections office, saying she would be dropped from the voting rolls in 30 days unless she provided proof of her US citizenship.
    


            Minotti, who was born in Argentina and moved to the United States with her parents as a toddler, has been a US citizen for years. She said she quickly sent a scan of her US passport to the Denton County Elections Office, preserving her right to vote in next month's Texas primary elections. Denton County, north of Dallas, confirmed she had shown proof of citizenship.
    


            “I felt offended,” the 24-year-old graduate student said of the scrutiny. “I've voted in every election since I was 18, and now my vote was coming under question.”
    


            Minotti is among dozens of US citizens in Texas alone to have been ensnared in a massive drive by the Trump administration to search for immigrants and other ineligible voters on state voter rolls.
    


            The impact goes well beyond one state. Texas is among 27 states using a federal database overhauled last year to try to verify voters' citizenship — and has flagged potential problems on just 0.0003% of queries nationwide. One Republican election official in another state told CNN that “the vast majority” of voters in their state flagged by the system turned out to be citizens after further investigation.
    


            “The federal databases are not up to date,” said the person who asked not to be identified for fear of drawing the ire of the Trump administration and other Republicans. “They are not accurate. The last thing we want to do is disenfranchise eligible voters.”
    


            As President Donald Trump has vowed to nationalize elections, his administration has already launched several efforts to insert itself into functions traditionally left to the states. That's sparked worries about whether the exercise of flagging noncitizen voters will ultimately provide the administration a tool with which to challenge midterm results.
    


‘Worst-case scenarios': How Democratic election officials are preparing for potential Trump intrusion in the midterms



            Trump has long baselessly claimed that improper voting by immigrants has affected election outcomes, notably the presidential contest he lost in 2020.
    


            “It's an attempt to exert pressure and control that is completely inappropriate and to lay the groundwork to be able to call into question the results if they don't go the way that the administration wants them to go,” said Eileen O'Connor, a former voting rights attorney in the Justice Department who is now a senior counsel with the left-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
    


            White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson argued in a statement that federal laws give the Justice Department “full authority” to ensure that states maintain accurate voter rolls.
    


            “President Trump is committed to ensuring that Americans have full confidence in the administration of elections, and that includes totally accurate and up-to-date voter rolls free of errors and unlawfully registered non-citizen voters,” she said.
    


            CNN spoke with state and local election officials to examine how voter rolls are being checked against a tool known as Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE.
    


            Federal law requires states to make “reasonable” efforts to ensure that ineligible individuals are removed from the rolls. States already use an array of tools to maintain voter registration lists on a rolling basis, including obtaining data on people who have moved from the US Postal Service and motor-vehicle agencies and reports on people who died from state and federal sources.
    


            Trump administration officials are increasingly arguing that state lists covering more than 200 million registered voters should be error-free to preserve election integrity. “Even one person voting who shouldn't have voted is one too many,” Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said in a recent video.
    


            SAVE has long been used to verify the citizenship and immigration status of people seeking government benefits. For years, some election officials also had agreements with the federal government to use the tool, for a fee, to check the citizenship status of voters. Some Republican officials and conservative activists called for expanded access to federal data to help vet voters.
    


            The Trump administration dramatically expanded SAVE last year, linking it to Social Security and US passport data and allowing states to make bulk uploads of voter records for free. The administration has strongly encouraged states to use it.
    


            In a letter posted online last year by Tennessee Secretary of State Tre Hargett, Trump praised Hargett for participating in SAVE, saying it demonstrates the Republican's “commitment to safeguarding American elections.”
    


            Officials in Democratic-led states have largely refused to participate in Trump's voter-verification program, arguing that SAVE is unreliable and could lead to faulty matches that put legitimate voters at risk of being unable to cast a ballot.
    


            States have made nearly 59 million voter verification queries since April, according to agency data provided to CNN. SAVE has flagged more than 18,000 suspected noncitizens among them.
    


            US Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement that the agency “is just getting started with SAVE enhancements and is committed to strengthening the program and expanding its reach.”
    


            “We encourage all states to utilize SAVE to help eliminate voter fraud and restore trust in American elections,” he added.
    


            Some Republican election chiefs say SAVE is another useful way to check their state voter rolls — provided that officials carefully vet the results.
    


            Using SAVE as part of its research, Idaho turned up about 760 potential noncitizens among the nearly 1.1 million people on the state's voter rolls, Phil McGrane, Idaho's secretary of state, told CNN last year. Most of the people flagged were indeed US citizens, said McGrane, a Republican. Eventually, election officials winnowed the list to about a dozen cases that were sent to Idaho State Police for possible criminal investigation.
    


            McGrane said enhanced citizenship verification is worthwhile to ensure “that there's public trust in elections and confidence in the process.”
    


            “The fact that we're taking action (and) showing that the numbers are minimal, I think that's really important for the voting public,” he said.
    


            Texas was among the first states to use the revamped SAVE tool, running its entire list of more than 18 million registered voters through it last year. Secretary of State Jane Nelson, an appointee of Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, said the analysis found 2,724 suspected noncitizens and referred them to individual counties to investigate further.
    


            The state directed counties to give voters 30 days to verify their citizenship. But election officials across Texas have identified citizens flagged in error.
    


            “It's pretty clear that the list isn't as close to accurate as the federal government thinks,” said Chris McGinn, the executive director of the Texas Association of County Election Officials.
    


            A spokesperson for Nelson's office did not respond to CNN's questions.
    


            In Denton County, where Minotti votes, the state identified 84 potential noncitizens on the county rolls. Frank Phillips, the county's election administrator, said his review found that 14 had indicated they were not citizens on voter registration forms but had been improperly added to the registration rolls. None had a history of voting in the county. They have been removed from the rolls.
    


            Fifteen, including Minotti, have provided documents establishing their citizenship and remain on the rolls.
    


            But the majority of those flagged as suspected noncitizens — 55 — have not responded to the county's notices and have had their registrations canceled, according to the county's tally. Some could be US citizens and might show up to vote in upcoming elections without realizing they had been removed from the rolls.
    


            “My fear is that they got the letter during a time period when there was a lot of campaign mail going out, so never looked at it or just threw it away and now they have been removed,” Phillips said.
    


            Emily French, policy director at the voter advocacy group Common Cause Texas, said the process so far appears to mostly affect foreign-born people who later gained US citizenship.
    


            “The No. 1 victim of this is always newly naturalized citizens because they have years and years of data saying they are not citizens and then they become one and cast their first vote,” she said.
    


            French notes that, under Texas law, voters incorrectly removed can be restored to the voting rolls as soon as they provide proof of citizenship. She suggests voters check their registration status with their election office if concerned they were improperly removed.
    


            US Citizenship and Immigration Services has cautioned states to “take additional steps” to verify voters' status and to provide due process before removing them from the rolls. Trump administration critics argue the approach used widely in Texas — sending out notices giving voters 30 days to prove their citizenship — puts the burden on voters to prove they have done nothing wrong and find paperwork to show to the government.
    


            “The upshot here is that they have imposed a backdoor documentary proof-of-citizenship requirement, which is something that folks in the Trump administration have been trying to pursue through other avenues,” said Nikhel Sus, chief counsel of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, pointing to unsuccessful efforts in Congress to pass that requirement.
    


            CREW represents voting rights and privacy advocates who are suing in federal court to block the administration's continued use of SAVE. The lawsuit contends that, among other issues, SAVE is  unreliable for voter verification because the Social Security Administration does not automatically update the citizenship status of people who become naturalized after they obtain Social Security numbers.
    


            Early voting in Texas starts on February 17 ahead of March 3 primaries, which include closely watched races for US Senate and several potentially competitive House races.
    


            Minotti, who is working on her master's degree in counseling, said she nearly missed the Denton County notice because she doesn't pay much attention to mail and, at first, ignored the plain white envelope from the election office.
    


            Minotti said she's now paying close attention to everything election related. “Voting is just one of the ways we can express our opinion,” she said.
    


            In the meantime, she said, the dates for the upcoming elections are circled on her calendar.

            Jeffrey Epstein's life as a free man was about to end, but first he needed to cancel breakfast plans with a friend: Steve Bannon, the right-wing influencer and former adviser to President Donald Trump.
    


            In the days leading up to Epstein's arrest in July 2019, the two men exchanged a steady stream of text messages, veering from breezy banter and dark humor to more serious strategizing around Bannon's efforts to foment a global populist movement.
    


            Writing from Paris, Epstein pressed Bannon to rally US support behind a Slovakian leader seeking a top NATO post. Bannon, meanwhile, wanted Epstein's help connecting a close ally in Israel with the country's former prime minister. They also traded barbs about the indictment of a British anti-Muslim activist and made plans to meet the morning of July 7 once Epstein returned from Europe.
    


            The conversation came to a halt on July 6. After messaging with Bannon that day about their upcoming rendezvous, Epstein suddenly wrote, “All canceled.” He sent the message at 7:37 p.m. ET, according to US Department of Justice records. By then, federal authorities had intercepted Epstein at a New Jersey airport and arrested the New York financier on charges he sex trafficked minors.
    


            But for its abrupt ending, the exchange mirrored hundreds of other text and email messages between the two men in the Epstein files. The records, released by the DOJ and House Oversight Committee, reveal a close personal relationship — and show Epstein's deep involvement in Bannon's ambitions on the world stage.
    


            For years, Bannon has served as a leading voice for the American alt-right, and he has sought to spread to other countries the movement that helped propel Trump to the presidency. Until now, his maneuverings abroad, well documented by US and foreign media, have drawn little speculation that Epstein played any role.
    


            Conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein — whose body was found in his jail cell while he was awaiting trial in August 2019, with his death ruled a suicide — have long animated Bannon's followers, generally directed at the same elites he regularly targets and not Bannon himself. Last summer, Bannon joined other MAGA loyalists in criticizing the Trump administration's handling of documents related to Epstein's crimes. He has been far less vocal, however, about his own relationship with Epstein.
    


            Bannon did not return phone calls and text messages from CNN.
    


            Epstein offered Bannon the same things he extended to many powerful confidantes: strategic advice, connections to the highest levels of government and business, and access to his vast wealth. He appeared increasingly invested in Bannon's success even as he recognized his own history — Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to two state prostitution charges, one involving a child — could complicate their cause.
    


            “Lets make sure you are keeping your own path on front burner. Strategy etc.,” he wrote Bannon in August 2018, before adding: “at the same time. Take no heat re me. Not worth it for the moment.”
    


            Bannon, for his part, appeared eager to capitalize on the relationship despite Epstein's criminal past. He regularly shared headlines from his efforts abroad and tapped into Epstein's extensive network. At one point, he asked Epstein: “Do u know anyone in Europe that wants to control the European Parliament and with it the EU.”
    


            In private exchanges, the two sometimes plotted next steps and workshopped Bannon's messaging.
    


            The night before Bannon was set to appear at a September 2018 forum hosted by The Economist, Epstein suggested framing for how Bannon should discuss Trump's contentious trade wars.
    


            “Brilliant brilliant brilliant,” Bannon responded, “help me develop that argument.”
    


            Bannon appeared on Epstein's radar after the 2016 election.
    


            In the days following Trump's stunning victory, Epstein served as a sounding board to the rich and powerful. Business leaders across Europe, a senior British politician, a pair of prominent journalists and a New Age guru all reached out to Epstein by email, searching for insight into what the outcome would mean for financial markets, politics and the world order.
    


            “I have been comforting people all day,” he replied from Paris to a particularly despondent email. “its going to be better than fine.”
    


            One acquaintance, however, shared something other than shock — sending Epstein a 2014 interview of Bannon, granted before he became Trump's campaign manager and the architect of his improbable win. In it, Bannon had predicted with eerie precision the populist uprising that would carry Trump to the White House, forecasting a middle-class revolt, led by right-wing forces, that would soon upend geopolitics.
    


            Epstein was introduced to Bannon shortly after the election, the journalist and author Michael Wolff wrote in his 2019 book, “Siege: Trump Under Fire.” In a passage Wolff shared with Epstein before publishing, Bannon reportedly told Epstein, “You were the one person I was truly afraid of coming forward during the campaign.”
    


            But more than a year would pass before they connected to export Bannon's global vision. Their alignment took shape as both men found themselves on the margins of Trump's orbit. Bannon had been pushed out of the White House in August 2017 after serving as a senior adviser, and Epstein's once-close friendship with Trump ended in the mid-2000s, according to the president, though they each owned massive estates on the same barrier island in South Florida.
    


            In early 2018, Wolff shared with Epstein gossip that Bannon was weighing a formal public break from the president while forming his own nationalist party. Wolff offered a bullish view on Bannon's prospects, arguing his platform was “coherent, rational, and, apparently appealing to a great many people.”
    


            “What does he have to lose?” Wolff asked.
    


            (Asked for comment about the email, Wolff didn't address his remarks and instead encouraged CNN to read the chapter on Epstein in his 2021 book, “Too Famous,” which he said “has substantial material about Steve.”)
    


            Over the next month, Bannon appeared to walk Epstein through his plans for a new center-right coalition, one that could outlast democratic elections for more than a decade. Over email, Bannon described his movement as “reverse Alabama” — “Populist/Nationalist first; Conservative Christians (catholic/evangelical) next.”
    


            Epstein was hungry for more details.
    


            “I need to understand flow of funds,” Epstein said, adding there would be “money needed for think tank, for ads. for policy meetings.. though (sic) leaders.” He mentioned cryptocurrency as a potential option and encouraged Bannon to study the blockchain.
    


            Communications accelerated from there, and so did their relationship. Epstein helped arrange travel for Bannon, pestered him to get his blood screened and offered to pay for his medical expenses.
    


            “We have become friends,” Epstein confided to a Dubai businessman.
    


            Bannon was soon making waves in Europe, speaking to packed rooms as he looked to spread an anti-elite, anti-migrant message. He kept Epstein apprised of his movements, at one point sharing a news clip with the headline: “German Media Confess to Underestimating Steve Bannon; He Is ‘As Dangerous as Ever.'”
    


            Epstein replied: “luv it.”
    


            For his part, Epstein coached Bannon on how to court Europeans, warning him the continent “can be a wife not a mistress.”
    


            “If you are going to play here, you'll have to spend time, europe by remote doesn't work,” he wrote. “Lots and lots of face time and hand holding.”
    


            Epstein had his own interests abroad, particularly the political future of Slovakian diplomat Miroslav Lajčák, the president of the United Nations General Assembly in 2017 and 2018. Lajčák, Epstein told Bannon in an email, would “guide the EU project if you like him.”
    


            “his govt will fall this week - as planned,” Epstein wrote in March 2018, punctuating it with a smiley face.
    


            Lajčák, a former foreign minister in Slovakia, resigned last month from his position as an adviser to the Slovakian government after the latest Epstein release, according to Reuters. Lajčák has denied wrongdoing.
    


            Epstein also offered to serve as an intermediary with “Kurz,” a likely reference to then-Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, whose rise was on Epstein's radar. Epstein said Kurz was eager to meet Bannon.
    


            As they moved around the world like pieces on a Risk board, Epstein and Bannon reflected on their consequential partnership.
    


            “Now you can understand why trump wakes up in the middle of the night sweating when he hears you and I are friends,” Epstein once texted Bannon.
    


            He messaged back: “Dangerous.”
    


            By August 2018, Bannon indicated the tide was turning in their favor.
    


            In a text message to Epstein, he took credit for the fall of the Belgian government (“5 hours after my speech” in Brussels, he noted) and predicted populist and nationalist groups would soon flex their numbers in Great Britain, France and elsewhere. He was even hopeful that political allies might win control of the European Parliament the following spring.
    


            “We can run the tables here,” Bannon wrote.
    


            Some of the excitement was justified. In 2019, moderate and establishment parties took hits across the continent, while nationalist, anti-migrant messengers made considerable gains. While this broke the coalition between centrist parties at the European Parliament, far-right groups did not win a majority of seats.
    


            Bannon's ties to Epstein grew more problematic during this period. In November 2018, The Miami Herald started publishing a series of meticulously reported stories by Julie K. Brown including accounts from dozens of Epstein's victims and detailing how he had evaded more serious federal charges. The series gained national attention, in part because the role a Trump Cabinet official had played in negotiating the unusual plea deal more than a decade earlier.
    


            “Reminder,” Epstein wrote Bannon as the spotlight turned back to his legal troubles, “I fully understand my toxicity for the moment. and I want you to win.”
    


            Meanwhile, Bannon was increasingly pulled into domestic politics. Republicans had taken a beating during the midterm elections, and special prosecutor Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference was casting a shadow over Trump's presidency.
    


            Bannon told Epstein in May 2019 that Trump's political operation was in “chaos” with internal polls predicting an Electoral College landslide against the president.
    


            Epstein urged his friend to focus on Europe. He appeared concerned about Bannon's well-being and encouraged him to get more sleep.
    


            The two were also working on another project that was eating up their busy schedules: a potential documentary featuring Epstein. The Justice Department recently released two hours of video of Epstein speaking with an off-camera interviewer whose voice resembles Bannon.
    


            Many of their final emails concern missed chances for them to record more footage, unaware that a deadline was fast-approaching.
    


            “I am focused on you WINNING! So no worries,” Epstein wrote on June 11 after one such failed get-together. “Movement first.”
    


            Less than a month later, Epstein was in federal custody.

All Kenneth Walker did was go out and win MVP","https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/09/sport/kenneth-walker-iii-super-bowl-mvp-football","Mon, 09 Feb 2026 08:06:06 GMT","


            Kenneth Walker Jr. never saw his son play in the NFL before Sunday night. He'd sat with him in the hospital when his boy was treated for blood clots in his lungs and he'd worked with his son to prove the doctors wrong – to prove that he would play football again.
    


            But the overwhelming in-person experience of an NFL game was too much. Then his son's agent changed his mind: He had to show up for Super Bowl LX.
    


            Suffice to say, Kenneth Walker III has set quite the standard for himself to live up to the next time his dad is in the stadium.
    


‘Those are a bunch of bad boys': Seattle's defense beats up the Patriots in a Super Bowl performance for the ages



            Walker, a fourth-year player out of Michigan State University, ran for 135 juking, sliding, shuffling, lung-busting yards against the New England Patriots on Sunday night and put himself among the greats of the game by being voted the MVP of Super Bowl LX.
    


            “My dad, he comes out to Seattle all the time and watch games, but he never goes to the game because he don't like crowds,” Walker said after his stellar performance.
    


            “So, this is his first NFL game, and we won a Super Bowl, so it means a lot to me and I know you're proud of me for real.”
    


            Walker has had some dominating performances in big games throughout his football career – five touchdowns in a classic Spartan win over Michigan in 2021 and 116 yards over the San Francisco 49ers and three touchdowns in the divisional round of these playoffs spring to mind – but he's never really had a game like this.
    


            With his defense dominating on the other side of the ball and his own offense sputtering, Walker had to be Him for the Seahawks in a way that he hadn't been asked all year – mostly because he had Zach Charbonnet beside him.
    


            Charbonnet and Walker made up the running back duo that was the pace-changer for the Seahawks offense, the complement to their devastating aerial attack led by Sam Darnold. But in the divisional round, Charbonnet tore his ACL and was ruled out for the rest of the season.
    


            So, the ball, literally and figuratively, was given to Walker.
    


            “You never want to see your brother get hurt, but I was gonna have to pick up the slack and I just wanted to make a positive impact on my team in whatever way possible,” Walker told reporters after the game.
    


            After softening up the New England defense in the opening quarter, Walker started to find a groove.
    


            At one point, NBC's color commentator Cris Collinsworth openly wondered how many yards Walker had picked up after going backward. He was all over the place, breaking tackles and making guys miss when they had a clean shot at him. The Seahawks couldn't get the ball into the end zone, but it was Walker putting them in position to score the field goals that built their lead in the opening stages of the game.
    


            By the time the fourth quarter rolled around, Walker was ready to burst. And he made a run he'll never forget – even though it didn't count.
    


            “The O-line had the hole wide open, I just really had to beat the safety and whoever was on my left,” he said of his 49-yard run into the end zone that was called back for a holding penalty.
    


            “I scored and looked back and it's a flag and, you know, that's probably the worst feeling ever. But, we won the game, so I'm not gonna complain.”
    


            There's one word that his teammates kept using about Walker.
    


            “K9 is special,” said Seattle safety Julian Love. “There's not a person in the building that doesn't believe that we're a better team when he's going, and so to see him and when he gets MVP, it's crazy. He's earned it. I mean, there's been so much doubt on his name.
    


            “He shows up each day. He's a quiet guy. He's a menace with that ball in his hands, and so he showed it today. The MVP is crazy, his whole playoff run. Obviously, Zach (Charbonnet), we love him, and it was vital having both of them all season. But it was more on K9's shoulders when Zach went down. And so, he showed up for us.”
    


            “I'm so happy for him,” said Jaxon Smith-Njigba, the team's star wide receiver. “Y'all don't understand what K9 has gone through. He's a special player. He's a special player and our o-line – they're special. We have a special group of guys and I feel like when you look back at this team, y'all will realize how special we are.”
    


            In a league where everyone is constantly predicting the demise of the running back position, Walker is proof that the old ways still work. Turning around and handing the ball off can be the way that you settle down an offense in the biggest game of their lives. It can be the way that a defense softens up to the point that you can finally get in the end zone, even if it doesn't count. It can lead you down the field for five goals – a new Super Bowl record.
    


            And it can win you the Vince Lombardi trophy.
    


            “When the doctor told me I couldn't play no more – I just thought football was over,” Walker said after the game. “That's what I was doing all my life, so it was a shocking moment, but you know my dad worked with me throughout that whole process and he was in the hospital with me, as well and my mom.
    


            “Just going through that, it just made me grateful for each and every day to be able to go out there and strap up and play this game and just still be alive, for real.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Bad Bunny dressed down to rule the Super Bowl halftime show","https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/09/style/bad-bunny-super-bowl-white-outfit-lotw","Mon, 09 Feb 2026 06:16:48 GMT","


EDITOR'S NOTE:  Featuring the good, the bad and the ugly, ‘Look of the Week' is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days.



            Bad Bunny's style has always defied expectations. So, amid intense speculation that he would use his Super Bowl outfit to subvert masculine stereotypes, stage a protest or publicly lambast ICE (again), it was perhaps no surprise that he did precisely none of those things.
    


            This was a jubilant celebration of culture and music, not a searing piece of social commentary. The Puerto Rican rapper teased as much at Apple Music's halftime show press conference on Thursday, when he said that “people only have to worry about dancing.” Bookmakers were, nonetheless, taking bets on whether he'd wear a skirt, or even a ballgown, until the moment he took the stage.
    


            In the end, however, Bad Bunny simply did what he's best at: being impeccably well-dressed. Anything more flamboyant might have been an unwelcome distraction.
    


Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime performance redefined what it means to be an American patriot



            The real surprise was that he turned to Zara for his outfits, rather than one of the many luxury labels for whom this would have represented a major coup. While it's unclear whether Bad Bunny was sponsored by the Spanish fast fashion retailer to wear its clothes, or if the decision was organically made to nod to the singer-songwriter largely performing his songs in Spanish, top designers would surely have relished this opportunity. Just last week, couture label Schiaparelli even made its first foray into menswear in its 99-year history just to dress him for the Grammys.
    


            Emerging to the 2022 hit “Tití Me Preguntó,” football in hand, he began the halftime show as he would end it, in head-to-toe white. His collared shirt and necktie peeked out from beneath a custom faux football jersey that faintly bared his family name, Ocasio, and the number 64, which immediately sparked fan theories on what it might represent. The legs of his spotless chinos rested perfectly atop a pair of his Adidas BadBo 1.0 sneakers (what bigger stage to unveil the new collaboration's cream colorway?).
    


            Lady Gaga's guest interlude presented the perfect chance for a costume change. But he instead stuck steadfastly to the theme, reappearing in a double-breasted cream blazer — a wardrobe switch so subtle that many viewers will have missed it entirely. Ricky Martin followed suit, albeit with significantly more chest on display, in a loosely tailored all-white ensemble.
    


            Known for combining high fashion with streetwear, Bad Bunny has a reputation for adventurous and subversive style. He often uses outfits to make a point, whether arriving at the Met Gala with a 26-foot-long floral train or wearing a skirt on “The Tonight Show” to draw attention to the murder of a homeless transgender woman. But the Super Bowl is a broad church, and this was, by design, an evening on which clothes didn't do the talking.
    


            One quietly uttered message may have been about accessibility — and a reluctance to flaunt wealth at a time when many American households face rising costs. The Super Bowl stage has been a custom luxury runway in recent years (a recent exception being Kendrick Lamar's dancers wearing Uniqlo T-shirts last time, though he wore designer labels Martine Rose and Celine). Zara, by contrast, is a brand within reach for many viewers. Ignoring his 18-carat gold Audemars Piguet watch for just a moment, Bad Bunny may have been presenting himself as an everyman among the farmers and domino players of his Puerto Rico-inspired production.
    


            The overarching theme here, though, was one of love and unity, told through the rapper's rallying cry of “God bless America,” which he followed by shouting out the names of countries across the Americas. At the end of the performance, he held out the same football he'd arrived on stage with, the words “Together We Are America” stamped across it.
    


            The production wardrobe still found plenty of ways to pay homage to Puerto Rico — a recurring theme of Bad Bunny's fashion — with performers wearing the island's traditional “pava” straw hats and the colors of the Puerto Rican flag. Lady Gaga, meanwhile, sported a blue flamenco dress by Luar, adorned with a brooch modeled on Puerto Rico's national flower, the Flor de Maga.
    


            And beyond fashion, the set was dripping with symbolism, from sugar canes evoking the island's colonial past to power lines speaking to its unreliable infrastructure (the latter were climbed by dancers during a rendition of “El Apagón,” or “The Power Outage”). Yet, the iconography was primarily one of pride, not protest.
    


            Fashion icons know when to use their own backs to make a statement, and when to bow to the occasion. In that sense, Bad Bunny's pared-back, minimalist approach reflected his vision for halftime: no prints, no patterns, no overt subtext — just celebration.

Lee este artículo en español



            Key Venezuelan opposition figure Juan Pablo Guanipa was arrested by heavily armed men on Sunday night, his supporters said, just hours after he had been released from a jail where he was held as a political prisoner.
    


            Guanipa's family and political allies said he had been “kidnapped” by a group of men and accused the Caracas regime of being responsible.
    


            The country's public prosecutor's office later confirmed it had requested Guanipa be placed under house arrest, claiming a breach of his release conditions, without providing details.
    


            Leader of the conservative Primero Justicia party, Guanipa was among several high-profile political prisoners freed on Sunday, in the latest effort from Caracas to satisfy US demands following Washington's ouster of strongman leader Nicolás Maduro.
    


            But Guanipa, 61, was later snatched by a group of men in the Los Chorros neighborhood of Caracas, said Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Laureate María Corina Machado, who is not in the country.
    


            “Heavily armed men dressed in civilian clothes arrived in four vehicles and took him away by force,” she said on X.



            Guanipa's son Ramón said in a video that his father was “ambushed” at a late night event “by approximately 10 agents who had no identification whatsoever.”
    


            “They pointed their guns at them, they were heavily armed, and they took my father,” he said, before demanding to see proof his father was still alive.
    


            Guanipa's Primero Justicia party also accused the Caracas regime of being behind the kidnapping. “We hold (interim President) Delcy Rodríguez, (National Assembly President) Jorge Rodríguez, and (Interior Minister) Diosdado Cabello responsible for any harm against the life of Juan Pablo,” it said in a statement on X.
    


            CNN has reached out to the prosecutor's office for more information on the release conditions Guanipa is accused of breaching.
    


            In the past, conditions have ranged from travel bans and periodic court appearances to gag orders, according to lawyer Gonzalo Himiob, vice president of the rights group Foro Penal. He emphasized that even after political prisoners are released, legal proceedings remain open in all cases, so they are not considered fully free.
    


            After Maduro was captured by US special forces last month, his former deputy Rodríguez took over as leader with the blessing of the Trump administration, on the proviso Caracas complied with a raft of US demands – from access to oil to the release of political prisoners.
    


            Guanipa was arrested in May 2025, following claims by Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, made without evidence, that he was involved in an alleged “terror” plot against regional and legislative elections. Guanipa has repeatedly denied the accusation.
    


            Guanipa was freed earlier Sunday night after more than eight months in prison.
    


            Shortly after walking out of a detention center in Caracas, Guanipa had uploaded a video on social media, declaring, “Today we are being released. Much to discuss about the present and future of Venezuela, always with the truth at the forefront.”
    


            Machado had celebrated the news of his release earlier Sunday. “My dear Juan Pablo, counting down the minutes until I can hug you! You are a hero and history will always recognize it,” she wrote on social media.
    


Venezuela's Machado gave Trump her Nobel prize. In return she received a swag bag but no promise of support



            Another of Machado's allies, lawyer Perkins Rocha, was also released on Sunday, but under strict restrictions, according to his wife María Constanza.
    


            Foro Penal said it had confirmed that at least 30 political prisoners were released on Sunday, according to the group's director, Alfredo Romero.
    


            Others who were freed include Luis Somaza, a member of the Popular Will party, and Jesús Armas, an activist and former opposition councilman.
    


            Venezuela's opposition and human rights groups have long accused the country's authoritarian regime of using arbitrary arrests to suppress dissent. Foro Penal estimates that hundreds of additional political prisoners still remain behind bars.
    


            The government has denied that it holds people for political reasons, arguing that those in prison have committed crimes.
    


            Sunday's releases come days after Venezuela's National Assembly President Jorge Rodríguez promised relatives of political prisoners that “all detainees” would be freed. Rodríguez, the brother of acting president Delcy Rodríguez, said the process would be completed “no later than” Friday, February 13.
    

College students in Venezuela confronted acting President Delcy Rodríguez during her visit to the Central University of Venezuela (UCV) on Tuesday to demand that her government release professors and students imprisoned for political reasons.


‘Put your hand on your heart': Students in Venezuela demand Rodríguez pledge to release imprisoned professors and students



            His announcement comes as the acting socialist government moves forward with an amnesty bill that could lead to the mass release of prisoners – some of whom have been held since 1999, when strongman leader Hugo Chávez came to power – as a first step toward what officials describe as national reconciliation.
    


            Guanipa's case has raised doubts about that process. “The so-called amnesty, that veneer of false dialogue, is dead before it was born,” said the opposition party Alianza Bravo Pueblo.
    


            Although the government announced the release of “a significant number of people” days after the US captured Maduro, rights groups and family members believe that the pace of releases has been slow.
    


            So far, more than 380 people have been freed from prison, according to Foro Penal, while the government claims to have released more than 800.

House Democrats say Ghislaine Maxwell, the former girlfriend and confidante of Jeffrey Epstein, is appealing to President Donald Trump for clemency. This comes after lawmakers tried Monday to interview Maxwell, but she invoked her Fifth Amendment rights.

The former girlfriend and confidante of Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, is declining to answer House Oversight Committee questions, citing her 5th Amendment rights. GOP Rep. James Comer, who chairs the committee, says it is “very disappointing.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — House lawmakers tried Monday to interview Ghislaine Maxwell, but the former girlfriend and confidant of Jeffrey Epstein invoked her Fifth Amendment rights to avoid answering questions that would be self-incriminating.

The House Oversight Committee wanted Maxwell to answer questions during a video call to the federal prison camp in Texas where she's serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking. She's come under new scrutiny as lawmakers try to investigate how Epstein, a well-connected financier, was able to sexually abuse underage girls for years.

Amid a reckoning over Epstein's abuse that has spilled into nations around the globe, lawmakers are searching for anyone who was connected to Epstein and may have facilitated his abuse. Several also planned on Monday to look through unredacted versions of the files on Epstein that the Department of Justice has released to comply with a law passed by Congress last year.

Maxwell has been seeking to have her conviction overturned, arguing that she was wrongfully convicted. The Supreme Court rejected her appeal last year, but in December she requested that a federal judge in New York consider what her attorneys describe as “substantial new evidence” that her trial was spoiled by constitutional violations.

An attorney for Maxwell cited that petition and also told lawmakers that if President Donald Trump ended her prison sentence, she would be willing to testify that neither Trump nor former President Bill Clinton were culpable for wrongdoing in their relationships with Epstein, according to both Democratic and Republican lawmakers who exited the closed-door meeting.




Democrats said that was a brazen effort by Maxwell to have Trump end her prison sentence.

“It's very clear she's campaigning for clemency,” said Rep. Melanie Stansbury, a New Mexico Democrat.

Another Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, described Maxwell's demeanor during the short video call as “robotic” and “unrepentant.”

The Republican chair of the committee, Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, said it was “very disappointing” that Maxwell declined to participate in the deposition.

Family members of the late Virginia Giuffre, one of the most outspoken victims of Epstein, also released a letter to Maxwell making it clear they did not consider her “a bystander” to Epstein's abuse. 

“You were a central, deliberate actor in a system built to find children, isolate them, groom them, and deliver them to abuse,” Sky and Amanda Roberts wrote in the letter addressed to Maxwell.

Maxwell was moved from a federal prison in Florida to a low-security prison camp in Texas last summer after she participated in two-days of interviews with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.

Comer had also subpoenaed her at the time, but her attorneys have consistently told the committee that she wouldn't answer questions. However, Comer came under pressure to hold the deposition as he pressed for the committee to enforce subpoenas on Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. After Comer threatened them with contempt of Congress charges, they both agreed to sit for depositions later this month.

Comer has been haggling with the Clintons over whether that testimony should be held in a public hearing, but Comer reiterated Monday that he would insist on holding closed-door depositions and later releasing transcripts and video.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Beyond the car windows being smashed, people tackled on city streets — or even a little child with a floppy bunny ears snowcap detained — the images of masked federal officers has become a flashpoint in the Trump administration's immigration enforcement operations.

Not in recent U.S. memory has an American policing operation so consistently masked its thousands of officers from the public, a development that the Department of Homeland Security believes is important to safeguard employees from online harassment. But experts warn masking serves another purpose, inciting fear in communities, and risks shattering norms, accountability and trust between the police and its citizenry.

Whether to ban the masks — or allow the masking to continue — has emerged as a central question in the debate in Congress over funding Homeland Security ahead of Friday's midnight deadline, when it faces a partial agency shutdown.

“Humans read each others' faces — that's how we communicate,” said Justin Smith, a former Colorado sheriff who is executive director and CEO of the National Sheriffs' Association.

“When you have a number of federal agents involved in these operations, and they can't be identified, you can't see their face, it just tends to make people uncomfortable,” he said. “That's bringing up some questions.”

Masks on federal agents have been one constant throughout the first year of President Donald Trump's mass deportation operation.

What began as a jarring image last spring, when plain-clothed officers drawing up their masks surrounded and detained a Tufts University doctoral student near her Massachusetts home, has morphed into familiar scenes in Los Angeles, Chicago and other cities. The shooting deaths of two American citizens at the hands of federal immigration officers during demonstrations against ICE raids in Minneapolis sparked widespread public protest and spurred lawmakers to respond. 




“Cameras on, masks off” has become a rallying cry among Democrats, who are also insisting the officers wear body cameras as a way to provide greater accountability and oversight of the operations. 

House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters at the Capitol that unmasking the federal agents is a “hard red line” in the negotiations ahead.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement says on its website that its officers “wear masks to prevent doxing, which can (and has) placed them and their families at risk. All ICE law enforcement officers carry badges and credentials and will identify themselves when required for public safety or legal necessity.”

Fueled with funds from the Trump's big tax cuts bill, which poured some $170 billion into Homeland Security, ICE has grown to become among the largest law enforcement operations in the nation. Last year, it announced it had more than doubled its ranks, to 22,000, with rapid hiring — and $50,000 signing bonuses. Homeland Security did not respond to an emailed request for further comment. 

Most Republicans say the current political climate leaves the immigration officers, many of them new to the job, exposed if their faces and identities are made public.

Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said he just can't agree with Democrats' demand that officers unmask themselves.

“You know, there's a lot of vicious people out there, and they'll take a picture of your face, and the next thing you know, your children or your wife or your husband are being threatened at home,” he said. “That's just the reality of the world that we're in.”

It appears no other policing agency in the country regularly uses masking on a widespread basis. Instead, masks are used during special operations, particularly undercover work or at times during large crowd control or protest situations, and when there is inclement weather or individual health concerns.

Experts said only perhaps during the Ku Klux Klan raids or in the Old West has masking been a more widely used tool.

“It is without precedent in modern American history,” said the American Civil Liberties Union's Naureen Shah in Washington.

She said the idea of masked patrols on city streets seeking immigrants can leave people scared and confused about who they are encountering — which she suggested is part of the point.

“I think it's calculated to terrify people,” she said. “I don't think anybody viscerally feels like, OK, this is something we want to become a permanent fixture in our streets.”

Toward the end of the first Trump administration, Congress sought to clamp down after masked federal agents showed up in 2020 to quell protests in Portland and other cities. A provision requiring agents to clearly identify themselves was tucked into a massive defense authorization bill that Trump assigned into law.

Last year, California became the first state in the nation to ban most law enforcement officers, including federal immigration agents, from covering their faces. The Trump administration's Justice Department sued, saying the state's policies “create risk” for the agents.

Smith, of the sheriffs' association, said there's no easy answer to the current masking debate.

He suggested perhaps a middle ground could be reached — one that would allow officers to wear masks, but also require their badge or other identifying numbers to be prominently displayed.

Advocates said while unmasking the federal agents would be an important step, other restraints on immigration enforcement operations may be even more so.

They are pushing Congress to curb the ability of ICE officers to rely on administrative warrants in immigration operations, particularly to enter people's homes, insisting such actions should be required to use judicial warrants, with sign off from the courts. 

There is also an effort to end roving patrols — the ability of immigration officers to use a person's race, language or job location to question their legal status, sometimes called “Kavanaugh stops” after Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's concurring opinion to a Supreme Court decision last summer.

Greg Chen, senior director of government affairs at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said because Congress gave Homeland Security such robust funding in the tax cuts bill, “That's why the policy reforms are so important right now to bring the agency in check.”

Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., who recently returned from Minnesota, said the weight of the masked enforcement operation can be felt in ways that impact everyone — regardless of a person's own immigration status.

“It's a very a heavy presence of surveillance and intimidation,” she said. “No one is exempt.”

LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer battled Monday to cling to power as revelations about the relationship between the former U.K. ambassador to Washington and Jeffrey Epstein spiraled into a full-blown crisis for his 19-month-old government.

The prime minister's authority with his own Labour Party has been battered by fallout from the publication of files related to Epstein — a man he never met and whose sexual misconduct has not implicated Starmer.

Some lawmakers in Starmer's center-left Labour Party have called on him to resign for his error of judgment in appointing Peter Mandelson to the high-profile diplomatic post in 2024 despite his ties to the convicted sex offender. The leader of the Labour Party in Scotland, Anas Sarwar, joined those calls Monday, saying “the distraction needs to end, and the leadership in Downing Street has to change.”

“There have been too many mistakes,” Sarwar said, attempting to distance himself from the unpopular Starmer ahead of elections for Scotland's semi-autonomous Parliament in May.

AP correspondent Laurence Brooks reports on British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's attempt to fight for his job as revelations about Jeffrey Epstein's ties to a former ambassador spark a leadership crisis.

Starmer's chief of staff and his communications director have also quit in the last 24 hours. But Starmer's office said Monday that he does not plan to step down.

“He has a clear five-year mandate from the British people to deliver change, and that is what he will do,” Downing Street said in a statement.

After Sawar spoke, senior Cabinet colleagues spoke up to defend Starmer. Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy wrote on X: “We should let nothing distract us from our mission to change Britain and we support the Prime Minister in doing that.”




Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper posted: “At this crucial time for the world, we need his leadership not just at home but on the global stage.” Treasury chief Rachel Reeves wrote: “With Keir as our Prime Minister we are turning the country around.”

Lawmakers considered likely candidates to replace Starmer also backed him, including his former deputy Angela Rayner, who said the prime minister “has my full support.”

Starmer was due to address Labour lawmakers behind closed doors Monday evening in an attempt to rebuild some of his badly weakened authority.

Starmer fired Mandelson last September after emails were published showing that he maintained a friendship with Epstein after the financier's 2008 conviction for sex offenses involving a minor. Critics say Starmer should have known better than to appoint Mandelson in the first place. The 72-year-old Labour politician is a contentious figure whose career has been tarnished with scandals over money or ethics.

A new trove of Epstein files released by authorities in the United States last week has revealed more details about the relationship and put new pressure on Starmer.

Starmer apologized last week to Epstein's victims and said he was sorry for “having believed Mandelson's lies.”

He promised to release documentation related to Mandelson's appointment, which the government says will show that Mandelson misled officials about his ties to Epstein. But publication of the documents could be weeks away. They must be vetted on national security grounds and for potential conflicts with a police investigation.

Police are investigating Mandelson for potential misconduct in public office over documents suggesting he passed sensitive government information to Epstein a decade and a half ago. The offense carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.

Mandelson has not been arrested or charged, and he does not face any allegations of sexual misconduct.

Starmer's chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, took the fall for the decision to give Mandelson the job by quitting on Sunday. He said he “advised the prime minister to make that appointment, and I take full responsibility for that advice.”

McSweeney has been Starmer's most important aide since he became Labour leader in 2020 and is considered a key architect of Labour's landslide July 2024 election victory. But some in the party blame him for a series of missteps since then.

Some Labour officials hope that his departure will buy the prime minister time to rebuild trust with the party and the country.

Senior lawmaker Emily Thornberry said McSweeney had become a “divisive figure” and his departure brought the opportunity for a reset.

She said Starmer is “a good leader in that he is strong and clear. I think that he needs to step up a bit more than he has.”

Others say McSweeney's departure leaves Starmer weak and isolated.

Opposition Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch said Starmer “has made bad decision after bad decision” and “his position now is untenable.”

Since winning office, Starmer has struggled to deliver promised economic growth, repair tattered public services and ease the cost of living. He pledged a return to honest government after 14 years of scandal-tarred Conservative rule, but has been beset by missteps and U-turns over welfare cuts and other unpopular policies.

Labour consistently lags behind the hard-right Reform UK party in opinion polls, and its failure to improve had sparked talk of a leadership challenge, even before the Mandelson revelations.

Under Britain's parliamentary system, prime ministers can change without the need for a national election. If Starmer is challenged or resigns, it will trigger an election for the Labour leadership. The winner would become prime minister.

The Conservatives went through three prime ministers between national elections in 2019 and 2024, including Liz Truss, who lasted just 49 days in office.

Starmer was elected on a promise to end the political chaos that roiled the Conservatives' final years in power.

Labour lawmaker Clive Efford said Starmer's critics should “be careful what you wish for.”

“I don't think people took to the changes in prime minister when the Tories were in power,” he told the BBC. “It didn't do them any good.”

SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — Stars were front-and-center at Super Bowl 60, with Chris Pratt and Jon Bon Jovi introducing the teams, a series of soaring pre-game performances and Bad Bunny's much-anticipated halftime show featuring a tour of Puerto Rican culture and a real-life marriage.

Before the game at Levi's Stadium, Blue Ivy Carter and her sister Rumi leaped in an end zone and Green Day delivered a tribute to the Super Bowl's 60th anniversary.

Brandi Carlile kept it sincere and simple for “America, the Beautiful,” Charlie Puth made “The Star-Spangled Banner” big and soulful and Coco Jones brought a bit of the elements of both to “Lift Every Voice and Sing.” 

Bad Bunny brought Lady Gaga, Ricky Martin and a whole lot of his native Puerto Rico to his halftime show. 

“God bless America!” he shouted toward the end, a rare English phrase in the 13-minute halftime show. Then he gave a roll call of the nations of North, South and Central America, including Uruguay, Colombia, Venezuela, Cuba, the United States and Canada. 

A parade of flags from those nations marched through the sugar plantation fields that functioned as the show's centerpiece. 

After the list of nations, and at the end of the show, he declared, “Mi Patria Puerto Rico, seguimos aquí,” or “My homeland Puerto Rico, we are still here.”

He also brought out a parade of celebrities, including Cardi B, Jessica Alba and Pedro Pascal.




The 31-year-old began the performance in the furrows of the faux sugar cane crops, walking past unmistakable Puerto Rican imagery including farmers in straw hats, old men playing dominos and a shaved ice stand as he performed his 2022 reggaeton hit “Tití Me Preguntó.” He carried a football and wore an all-white football jersey with the number 64 and his real last name, Ocasio.

The opening and closing of the show were not really visible inside the stadium because it was obscured by the sugar cane plants, many of which were people in costumes who ran on to the field to form the maze. 

He then stood atop a tiny pink house with dancers in the front yard and performed “Yo Perreo Sola” and stood atop a pickup truck as he did “EOO.”

The scene shifted to a wedding, where the marrying couple parted to reveal Lady Gaga as the first surprise guest. She joined Bad Bunny in performing “Baile Inolvidable.” Gaga did her own Super Bowl halftime show in 2017.

The couple was actually married during the show, according to a representative for Bad Bunny, who said he served as a witness and signed their marriage certificate.

Bad Bunny then broke into his “NuevaYol” in a faux shopping center parking lot. 

Ricky Martin, a Puerto Rican star from a previous generation, joined him for “Lo Que Le Pasó a Hawaii.”

The show came a week after the 31-year-old superstar won the Grammy for album of the year for “Debí Tirar Más Fotos,” a love letter to his home. 

The halftime show included a young boy watching the Grammy telecast on TV with his parents. Bad Bunny appeared and handed the boy a Grammy statuette. 

As the show ended, he held up the football to the camera. It had a message that was also on the scoreboard: “The only thing more powerful than hate is love.” 

On Truth Social, President Donald Trump called the show “absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER!” 

San Francisco Bay Area punk-pop vets Green Day took the pre-game stage and performed a snippet of their song “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)” to a parade of former Super Bowl MVPs.

Local heroes Steve Young, Joe Montana and Jerry Rice were among those who walked out during the song meant to celebrate 60 years of Super Bowls.

Billie Joe Armstong, Mike Dirnt and Tre Cool then blasted into the harder and less sentimental stuff, including “Holiday,” “Boulevard of Broken Dreams” and “American Idiot.”

Armstrong did not censor the f-word in the lyrics of “American Idiot.” The word was muted on the NBC telecast but drew loud cheers inside the stadium.

Singer-songwriter Charlie Puth delivered a sweeping and soulful rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner.”

The 34-year-old from New Jersey stood at a Rhodes electric piano as he sang and was backed by a choir and horn section.

Before that, Brandi Carlile gave an earnest acoustic rendition of “America, the Beautiful.”

The 44-year-old folk and country rocker wore a black suit and was backed by a violin and cello on the field at Levi Stadium.

The Grammy winner told the AP this week that she'd use no prerecorded tracks, saying “the people deserve to have you live.”

After the song Carlile, who is from Ravensdale, Washington, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) outside Seattle said she was “relieved, and so excited for the Seahawks baby let's go!”

Coco Jones, a 28-year-old singer-songwriter and actor from Columbia, South Carolina wore a white gown and was backed by a string octet as she performed “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” a song that has become known as the unofficial Black national anthem.

“I feel really amazing, I hope that I did my ancestors proud, and I hope that I inspired the nation to come together,” Jones told the AP just after the song.

She FaceTimed with her mom on the sideline ater the performance while her fiance, Cleveland Cavaliers player Donovan Mitchell, held the phone.

Written by James Weldon Johnson, the song has been performed at the Super Bowl each year since 2021, the first Super Bowl after the protests surrounding the killing of George Floyd, when Black Lives Matter sentiment, and the song, became especially prominent.

Chris Pratt rocked a Seahawks jersey while attending the Super Bowl and gave a rousing introduction to the team before they ran out onto the field.

On the opposite side of the field, Jon Bon Jovi delivered the Patriots' intro.

Stars including Travis Scott and Jay-Z were on the sidelines ahead of the game. Jay-Z's daughters, Blue Ivy and Rumi Carter, leaped in one of the end zones to take a photo.

Among those sitting in suites watching the game were Justin Bieber, Hailey Bieber and Adam Sandler. 

During game breaks, Bay Area rapper LaRussell jammed alongside a choir, performing everything from rap classics such as his song “I'm From the Bay” and a rendition of Too $hort's “Blow the Whistle,” along with gospel melodies. 

LaRussell is the first artist chosen to curate the house band at the Super Bowl.

Among the commercials shown during the game was an unexpected first look at “The Adventures of Cliff Booth,” a Netflix sequel to Quentin Tarantino's “Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood” with Brad Pitt reprising his stuntman character and David Fincher directing.

Logan Paul gives one word answer to Fox News Digital as to whether he's excited for Bad Bunny's halftime show.

Boxer Jake Paul on Sunday explained his ""fake citizen"" jab aimed at singer Bad Bunny ahead of the Grammy Award winner's Super Bowl LX halftime show performance.

Paul wrote on social media he wasn't taking a swipe at Bad Bunny because he's from Puerto Rico, but instead because he was speaking out against things like U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

""To clarify: I wasn't calling anyone a ‘fake citizen' because they're from Puerto Rico. I live in Puerto Rico, and I love Puerto Rico. I have used my platform to support Puerto Rico time and time again and will always do so,"" he wrote. ""But if you're publicly criticizing ICE who are doing their job and openly hating on America, I'm going to speak on it. Period. That's the same reason I called out Hunter Hess.

""If you benefit from a country and the platform it gives you, but publicly disrespect it at the same time, that's what I mean by being a fake citizen. And I agree love is more powerful than hate. Love America.""

Paul wrote earlier in the day he was boycotting the Super Bowl halftime show over Bad Bunny's stance against ICE, adding that he was a fake American citizen performing who publicly hates America.

The singer prominently spoke out against ICE when he received his Grammy Award for Album of the Year earlier this month.

Nick Wright unveils his Super Bowl LX pick, New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks prop bets. 

The Seattle Seahawks' win over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LX marked a new chapter in the so-called ""Drake curse"" narrative.

Drake has leaned into the chatter and long-running jokes about his betting habits by openly sharing his sports wagers on social media. The narrative centers on the idea that teams he backs are somehow destined to lose.

On Saturday, Drake, who has a business partnership with Stake — an online sportsbook — took to social media to say he picked the Patriots to win the Super Bowl in Santa Clara, California.

""Bet against me if you dare,"" he captioned an Instagram post showing a screenshot of a $1 million wager on New England to win. Had the Patriots pulled off the upset, Drake stood to collect an estimated $2.95 million payout.

SEAHAWKS WIN SUPER BOWL LX AFTER DOMINANT DEFENSIVE PERFORMANCE AGAINST PATRIOTS

But the odds were ultimately not in the ""Thank Me Later"" rapper's favor. The Seahawks defense dominated the Patriots to secure a 29-13 victory, giving Seattle its second Vince Lombardi Trophy in franchise history.

A website, thedrakecurse.com, tracks the ""One Dance"" singer's wager activity. According to the site, Drake has placed 12 wagers related to the Super Bowl since 2022, compiling a 4-8 win-loss record.

To Drake's credit, he was successful in his prediction that the Kansas City Chiefs would knock off the San Francisco 49ers two years ago in the Super Bowl.

Turning Point USA spokesperson Andrew Kolvet discusses the success of their patriotic counter-programming to the NFL's Bad Bunny halftime set.

R&B artist Chris Brown appeared to throw his hat into the ring for Super Bowl halftime performer consideration on Sunday night as Bad Bunny's show appeared to divide viewers on social media.

Brown seemingly reacted to the Puerto Rican star's performance, which took place during Super Bowl LX at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California.

""I think it's safe to say … they need me!"" he wrote in a post on his Instagram Stories.

Bad Bunny's performance fell flat with President Donald Trump, who made his opinion on the show known through a Truth Social post.

""The Super Bowl Halftime Show is absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER! It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn't represent our standards of Success, Creativity, or Excellence. Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young children that are watching from throughout the U.S.A., and all over the World,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

""This ‘Show' is just a ‘slap in the face' to our Country, which is setting new standards and records every single day — including the Best Stock Market and 401(k)s in History! There is nothing inspirational about this mess of a Halftime Show and watch, it will get great reviews from the Fake News Media, because they haven't got a clue of what is going on in the REAL WORLD — And, by the way, the NFL should immediately replace its ridiculous new Kickoff Rule. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!""

Others lamented that the entire performance was in Spanish.

Sports stars like J.J. Watt and Jalen Brunson expressed support for the show. Watt called it a ""vibe"" despite not being able to understand Bad Bunny. Brunson thanked the singer for the performance.

Super Bowl LXI will take place on Feb. 14, 2027, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California.

The couple, who were on stage during Bad Bunny's Super Bowl LX halftime show on Sunday, were legally married, according to multiple reports.

The newlyweds were featured numerous times throughout the halftime show. They were surrounded by backup dancers on stage when they got married.

The couple originally invited Bad Bunny to attend their wedding, but instead Bad Bunny invited them to get married in front of a massive audience, according to the reports.

While the couple certainly enjoyed the halftime show, as they received the gift of a lifetime from Bad Bunny, the show was not viewed positively by all.

President Donald Trump did not mince words, calling it the worst ever in a post to Truth Social.

The War Department announced on Monday morning that the U.S. military boarded a vessel overnight ""without incident.""

The department's post on X noted that the U.S. had ""hunted"" the ship, called the Aquila II, ""from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean.""

""When the @DeptofWar says quarantine, we mean it. Nothing will stop DoW from defending our Homeland — even in oceans halfway around the world. Overnight, U.S. military forces conducted a right-of-visit, maritime interdiction and boarding on the Aquila II without incident in the INDOPACOM area of responsibility,"" the Monday post explained.

""The Aquila II was operating in defiance of President Trump's established quarantine of sanctioned vessels in the Caribbean. It ran, and we followed. The Department of War tracked and hunted this vessel from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean,"" the post continued.

""No other nation on planet Earth has the capability to enforce its will through any domain. By land, air, or sea, our Armed Forces will find you and deliver justice. You will run out of fuel long before you will outrun us,"" the department asserted.

""The successful interdiction of the Aquila II underscores the unmatched reach and resolve of the United States military under President Trump's and Secretary Hegseth's leadership. As we've publicly stated, our quarantine measures are ironclad, and no vessel defying them can evade justice, whether in the Caribbean or the far reaches of the Indian Ocean,"" Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

""The Department of War will continue to project power across every domain to safeguard our homeland and deter illicit actors worldwide,"" Wilson added.

""America, the beautiful. THANK YOU, BAD BUNNY,"" Newsom wrote on X. 

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., praised Bad Bunny in Spanish in an X post, and then pointed out that she shares the surname name ""Ocasio"" with the artist in a post on BlueSky. 

""Ocasio gang rise up,"" she wrote with a picture of Bad Bunny wearing an Ocasio 64 jersey.

Prominent conservative influencers were among the show's harshest critics, and even Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Justice Harmeet Dhillon chimed in. 

The show was expected to be the first Super Bowl halftime show to be sung entirely in Spanish. However, pop artist Lady Gaga showed up to sing the Bruno Mars song ""Die With a Smile."" 

Many fans opted to skip this year's Super Bowl halftime show to watch Turning Point USA's ""All-American"" halftime show, headlined by Kid Rock. 

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell defended having Bad Bunny as the performer earlier this week.

""Listen, Bad Bunny is, and I think that was demonstrated last night, one of the great artists in the world and that's one of the reasons we chose him,"" Goodell said. ""But the other reason is he understood the platform he was on and this platform is used to unite people and to be able to bring people together with their creativity, with their talents and to be able to use this moment to do that and I think artists in the past have done that.

Over 100 million viewers were presented with a choice at halftime of the 2026 Super Bowl: stick with Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny's performance on NBC or tune into an alternative show featuring Kid Rock that was hosted by the right-wing organization Turning Point USA.

 The NFL's selection of Bad Bunny, who sings primarily in Spanish, to do the halftime show led to fierce backlash from the Right, mostly due to his outspoken criticism of the Trump administration's mass deportation agenda. It sparked a boycott from President Donald Trump and his Cabinet, who have appeared at some of the biggest sporting events over the past year but passed on traveling to Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, for the game.

The criticism culminated in Turning Point hosting its own program dubbed the “All-American Halftime Show,” which featured Kid Rock, Brantley Gilbert, Lee Brice, and Gabby Barrett. Bad Bunny retains a huge following, though, setting up what has turned out to be a significant cultural clash on the sidelines of the big game.

Here's how the two performances went down on Sunday night.

Bad Bunny, born Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio, came out on the field of Levi's Stadium shortly after 8 p.m., donning an all-white suit with a jersey over it and singing “Titi Me Pregunto,” a song he released in 2022.

His outfit disproved rumors that he would wear some sort of dress during the performance, which instead saw him switch to the suit for most of the 13-minute performance.

The show included him singing 14 of his hit songs as he navigated an island-themed set, likely a nod to his hometown in Puerto Rico. It included numerous surprise guests, most notably Lady Gaga, who sang in English. Bad Bunny sang entirely in Spanish, though he did throw in a “God Bless America” message at one point.

It ended with performers running across the field with numerous flags, mostly of countries in the Western Hemisphere. The U.S. flag was prominent in the final act.

While not explicitly political, Bad Bunny's performance did include a nod to his Grammys speech last weekend, in which he said, “ICE out.” The reference occurred when he handed a Grammy award to a boy who could be seen watching the speech on a TV set. For most of the show, he was also holding a football that had the message “Together, we are America” written on it.

Turning Point's “All-American Halftime Show” began with an electric guitar version of “The Star-Spangled Banner,” followed by songs from country musician Brantley Gilbert, Gabby Barrett, Lee Brice, and finally Kid Rock.

Kid Rock, who was by far the main act and is a vocal supporter of Trump, walked out to “Bawitdaba,” which rocked the crowd present in the venue. He later played a cover of “Til You Can't” by Cody Johnson.

The show was held at a small venue that had patriotic imagery displayed on the walls. Despite not being held at a bigger stadium, there was still an in-studio audience present, though nothing approaching the number of people at Levi's Stadium.

While Bad Bunny's performance had the advantage of being live at the game, Turning Point's show brought in a sizable number of streamers. That number surpassed five million on the YouTube stream.

Despite previously saying he wouldn't watch the Super Bowl halftime show with Bad Bunny, Trump nonetheless weighed in on it in a screed posted to Truth Social.

He called it “absolutely terrible” and “an affront to the Greatness of America,” while expressing displeasure with Bad Bunny singing in Spanish and the performers' dance routine.

“The Super Bowl Halftime Show is absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER! It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn't represent our standards of Success, Creativity, or Excellence. Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young children that are watching from throughout the U.S.A., and all over the World,” the president posted.

“This ‘Show' is just a ‘slap in the face' to our Country, which is setting new standards and records every single day — including the Best Stock Market and 401(k)s in History! There is nothing inspirational about this mess of a Halftime Show and watch, it will get great reviews from the Fake News Media, because they haven't got a clue of what is going on in the REAL WORLD,” Trump added.

Bad Bunny's critics said his Super Bowl halftime show would be divisive. They were totally wrong.

In the days and weeks leading up to Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime show, a nervous kind of hype swept America. The 31-year-old artist is, by some measures, the most popular working musician in the world. But because he almost exclusively performs in Spanish and has spoken up against ICE, right-wing commentators suggested he was too political for the time slot, while branding him with various scary synonyms like “provocative” and “divisive.” Just a few hours before the show, the influencer Jake Paul called him “a fake American citizen performing who publicly hates America.”

During his performance on Sunday night, Bad Bunny had an answer for that last one: “God bless America,” he announced. But his entire performance rebuked the notion that he is some culture-war proxy being foisted upon an American public that wants its stars to shut up and sing. Yes, he filled this show with slogans and symbols signaling Puerto Rican and Latino pride at a time when federal agents are menacing Spanish speakers and President Trump has declared English to be the national language. But fundamentally, the halftime was a blast: an instant-classic, precisely detailed, relentlessly stimulating medley rooted in the good old-fashioned pleasure principle.

Bad Bunny opened in what looked like sugarcane fields worked by dancers dressed in the straw hats of jíbaros (Puerto Rico's rural farmers). Against this pastoral backdrop, Bad Bunny stood looking modern and fly, in a boxy white shirt patterned like an NFL jersey. He was rapping in Spanish to his smash “Tití Me Preguntó,” but the pigskin he held in his hand and the tie around his neck conveyed a clear message to any viewer. He was here for business. He was here to play ball.

Read: How Bad Bunny did it

Play he did. As he walked through the tropical hedge maze, he passed by whimsical set pieces including a coconut vendor, a dominoes match, and a construction site manned by—how to put this respectfully—hot girls. This was the first of many awooga visuals to come—mass twerking, a fleeting shot of guy-on-guy grinding, and Bad Bunny executing his trademark crotch thrust. If any of this inspires scandal, it'll be the healthy kind, giving America a break from fascism discourse to rehash now-quaint-seeming dustups caused by the likes of Elvis, Janet Jackson, and Prince (the originator of what's becoming a hallowed tradition of Super Bowl halftime crotch-troversies).

Really, what does it say about the state of the nation that the sight of good-looking people doing slinky choreography feels … refreshing? It's not like the much-publicized conservative cultural wave of the 2020s has rolled back pop culture's reliance on raunch. But this performance's wealth of gyration seemed subtly throwback-y and weirdly wholesome. Maybe that was because the smiles on everyone's faces conveyed sexiness without porniness. The dancing and costumes took me back to being a young teen watching the airbrushed sultriness of early-2000s MTV and being intrigued by the world that allegedly existed somewhere outside my home.

Bad Bunny was indeed trying to take viewers out of their home, and into his. The sheer volume of references to Puerto Rico defied any notion that the island is a minor player in American culture; rather, we were reminded that it's a powerhouse domestic and global exporter. Puerto Rico gave us the archetypal reggaeton hit, Daddy Yankee's “Gasolina,” which popped up for a few moments tonight. Its musicians helped invent salsa music—which provided much-needed syncopation when Lady Gaga appeared to sing her normally plodding hit “Die With a Smile.” It gave us the square jaw and honeyed voice of Ricky Martin, who sang as well. And it gave us the night's headliner, who nodded at the significance of his own success when he handed a Grammy to a boy who looked like he might grow up to one day be, well, Bad Bunny.

Eventually, the energy of the performance shifted from party to statement piece—yet smart stagecraft made that shift feel climactic rather than deflating. Exploding power lines evoked the electrical outages that have plagued Puerto Rico in recent years. For most of the show, Bad Bunny had been mugging merrily to the camera, flaring his eyes and making hammy gestures to illustrate his words. But now anger seemed to twitch in his face as he rapped his song “El Apagón” (“The Power Outage”). Through affect alone, he got across a sense of betrayal that many Puerto Ricans of his age—commonly called the “crisis generation”—have spoken of feeling after a string of political scandals and natural disasters amid ongoing gentrification by mainlanders.

That message was, indeed, political. So was his culminating statement of “God bless America,” which he followed by listing countries in North and South America, thereby asserting the transnational nature of the culture that he represents. Pushing toward the camera with throngs of drummers, he closed by holding up a football with a message on it: Together, We Are America. It was a pointed message but also a conciliatory one, a unity slogan. Some people were going to look for a fight anyway. “Nobody understands a word this guy is saying,” complained Trump on Truth Social, minutes after the performance, “and the dancing is disgusting.”

The nightmare scenario for American democracy is no longer unthinkable.

Ever since the United States entrusted its presidency to a would-be insurrectionist in January 2025, many Americans have feared for the integrity of their nation's future elections.

And not without reason. President Donald Trump made his contempt for democracy clear on January 6, 2021. Shortly after retaking office last year, he pardoned the rioters who'd stormed the Capitol in his name, gutted the agency that protects America's voting infrastructure from cyberattacks, attempted to unconstitutionally deter the counting of many mail-in ballots, and threatened to prosecute officials who had faithfully administered the 2020 election.

If concerns that Trump might unduly influence the 2026 midterms aren't new, however, they've grown markedly more plausible over the past two weeks.

• Trump has said he regrets not ordering the military to seize voting machines in 2020.

• The president has called for Republicans to “take over the voting” in at least 15 places.

• The FBI's seizure of ballots and voter information from Fulton County, Georgia, sets an alarming precedent.

• Despite these threats, experts believe election interference attempts will likely fail due to institutional resistance.

In late January, the FBI seized 2020 election records — ballots, voter rolls, and scanner images — from a government facility in Fulton County, Georgia. This raid represented a new frontier in the president's use of federal law enforcement to advance his conspiratorial claims of electoral impropriety.

Meanwhile, as ICE agents brutalized and killed protesters in Minnesota, US Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote a letter to that state's governor, Tim Walz, in which she appeared to propose a bizarre quid pro quo: If Walz wished to see “an end to the chaos in Minnesota” — and, implicitly, a pullback in ICE operations there — he should give the Department of Justice access to his state's voter rolls.

If the subtext of these actions was unclear, the president spelled it out this week. In an interview with his former deputy FBI director Dan Bongino, Trump said that Republicans in Washington, DC, should “take over the voting” in at least “15 places.”

These developments came amid a decline in the GOP's poll numbers. And they have intensified fears that the president may try to preserve his party's control of Congress through undemocratic means.

“For anybody who doubted that this administration is laying the foundation to interfere in elections, the deluge of activity over the last two weeks should lay those doubts to rest,” said Wendy Weiser, vice president of democracy at the Brennan Center for Justice, a legal think tank at NYU Law School.

This interference could take many forms. But recent events have increased experts' level of concern about two possibilities in particular:

Below, I explain how recent events have made these hypotheticals more thinkable — and why the administration's efforts to unduly sway the midterms in its favor are, nonetheless, unlikely to succeed.

The “nightmare scenario” for this year's elections has long gone something like this: Control of the House comes down to a small number of close races. Republicans lead on Election Day in many of these contests, but their advantage steadily erodes as mail-in ballots arrive. The White House attributes these adverse trends to mass voter fraud and demands a halt to vote counting.

When states refuse to comply, the White House orders the military to seize ballots and voting machines from pivotal precincts before all votes have been tallied. The chain of custody over these ballots breaks down, making the elections' true winners impossible to determine. The House's incumbent GOP majority then asserts the authority to seat the Republican candidates in the contested races. American democracy, as we've known it, ends.

Even before the past two weeks, there was reason to take this hypothetical seriously. Indeed, throughout its first year in office, the second Trump administration appeared to be laying the groundwork for such treachery.

In an executive order last spring, Trump asserted that, if a mail-in ballot arrives after Election Day, states cannot legally count it. Currently, many states — including Nevada and Virginia — count ballots that arrive shortly after Election Day, if they were postmarked on time.

In that same executive order, Trump called on the Election Assistance Commission to decertify every voting machine in the United States — and then recertify only those that met an exacting set of requirements. As The Atlantic's David Graham notes, it's not even clear that the government could procure enough voting machines to meet these new standards in time for November's midterms.

Regardless, courts blocked both of these measures. Yet each established a rationale for the administration to reject any future election results that it did not like: This November, several states will count mail ballots in a manner that the White House has formally declared illegal, while virtually every precinct in the country will use voting machines that it has deemed untrustworthy.

Meanwhile, the House of Representatives has the constitutional authority to judge “the qualifications of its own Members.” And in the wake of a closely contested race in 1985, the House did choose to override a state-certified election result, and seat the candidate who had officially lost, on the basis of its own recount. Were the White House to impede vote counting in critical contests this November, it is conceivable that House Republicans could act on this precedent.

The FBI's raid in Fulton County makes this series of events a bit easier to envision.

That raid's ostensible aim was to search for evidence of voter fraud. But the president's allegations of such malfeasance are baseless. Fulton County's 2020 results have already been recounted, audited, and challenged in court multiple times. And the legitimacy of those results has been unfailingly affirmed.

Yet the administration was nonetheless able to secure a search warrant from a magistrate judge to seize the county's ballots.

The White House's success in garnering judicial approval for its confiscation of voting records — despite the overtly political and legally dubious nature of its investigation — has unnerved many legal experts. And some now fear that Trump could conceivably win a magistrate's approval to seize midterm ballots before they have been counted.

“The nightmare scenario used to be that Trump would invoke the Insurrection Act and have the military seize ballots and machines from a swing state on election night,” said Derek Clinger, senior counsel at the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School. “But Fulton County suggests a much more plausible scenario: one where the seizure of ballots is conducted with the appearance of a legal process. I think that approach is both more likely to happen and also harder to challenge in real time.”

This said, what Clinger describes as the old worst-case scenario — in which Trump orders the military to interfere with vote counting, on grounds of national security — has also become more thinkable in recent days.

To see why, one must consider the oddest aspect of the Fulton County raid: the fact that Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard personally attended it.

The DNI (aka America's spy chief) has no statutory role in overseeing the enforcement of federal election law. Gabbard's involvement therefore initially mystified many current and former government officials.

But the Wall Street Journal subsequently revealed that Gabbard had been tasked with leading an administration-wide effort to find evidence of foreign interference in the 2020 election.

This week, we learned that, as part of that effort, Gabbard oversaw an investigation into alleged cyberattacks on Puerto Rico's election infrastructure. Specifically, the probe reportedly tried — and failed — to find proof that Venezuela had hacked voting machines on the island.

“I think it is, tragically, an unfortunate possibility that ICE paramilitary forces will be misused in an attempt to deter people from participating in elections.”

There is no public evidence that any foreign government interfered in the 2020 election. But Trump and his allies have long taken a “the more, the merrier” approach to explaining away his defeat that year: In their account, mass voter fraud by undocumented immigrants, chicanery by American election administrators, and cyberattacks from Venezuelan hackers were all responsible for Joe Biden's victory.

That last theory first took off in November 2020, when Trump's attorney Sidney Powell falsely claimed that the voting machine companies Dominion and Smartmatic were secretly Venezuelan. In Powell's telling, those firms' machines were designed by the Chavez regime to facilitate election rigging. It quickly became gospel on parts of the right that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro had exploited secret programming within Dominion's machines to flip votes to Biden.

In December 2020, on the basis of such conspiracy theories, Powell pitched the president on an audacious plan: Declare a national security emergency and order the National Guard to seize voting machines in swing states. In an interview with the New York Times last month, Trump said that he regretted not acting on this advice.

Given this context, Gabbard's presence at the Fulton County raid — and her newly revealed search for evidence of Venezuelan hacking in Puerto Rico — are alarming. They indicate that the White House may be trying to engineer a pretense for (illegally) seizing voting machines this November, in the name of protecting America's national security.

Such a plan would be consistent with remarks that Cleta Mitchell — a conservative lawyer, “Stop the Steal” activist,” and outside adviser to Gabbard's election interference probe — made last fall.

In September, Mitchell said that the president “is limited in his role with regard to elections, except where there is a threat to the national sovereignty of the United States.” She suggested that Trump was therefore “thinking that he will exercise some emergency powers to protect the federal elections going forward.”

Finally, recent events have also amplified fears that the administration will use ICE as a means of voter suppression.

Bondi's attempt to extract sensitive voter information from Minnesota — by implicitly threatening to prolong intensive ICE operations in that state if it failed to comply — alarmed many Democrats.

To some in the party, Bondi's request signaled that the administration sees immigration enforcement as a tool for meddling in elections. Specifically, they fear that the White House may order ICE operations in the vicinity of key polling places on Election Day, so as to deter turnout.

Their reasoning is simple: If ICE is harassing residents and causing traffic jams in heavily Democratic precincts, fewer Americans will make it to the voting booth in those areas. And voters with undocumented family members may be especially likely to stay home.

“I think it is, tragically, an unfortunate possibility that ICE paramilitary forces will be misused in an attempt to deter people from participating in elections,” said Justin Levitt, a former DOJ official and professor at Loyola Law School.

Nevertheless, although experts are taking these hypotheticals more seriously, they generally believe that Trump's attempts at election interference will fail.

“There is a very high risk that the administration will use every tool at its disposal to get voting machines or ballots in the course of an upcoming election,” the Brennan Center's Weiser told me. “But I don't think there is a high risk that they will succeed.”

Weiser and others warned against reading too much into the administration's success at securing a search warrant for Fulton County's 2020 voting records.

“I think every magistrate judge in the country would understand the difference between a search warrant to seize materials for an election that happened five years ago and a search warrant to seize election materials from an election in progress,” Levitt said. “I understand why people are worried. But it's not remotely the same.”

Further, contrary to Mitchell's claims, there is no clause of the Constitution that gives the president authority over election administration, in the event of a foreign attack (whether real or imagined). Thus, any attempt to seize ballots or voting machines through military order would likely encounter vigorous resistance from the judiciary, elected officials, and perhaps, from the armed forces themselves.

Indeed, Trump's mere remarks about taking control of election administration provoked rebukes from some Republicans this week. And one heartening lesson of the past month is that such backlash can still constrain the president: After Border Patrol's killing of Alex Pretti sparked bipartisan criticism, Trump demoted the agency's commander and pulled 700 ICE agents out of Minnesota.

In an interview Wednesday night, Trump indicated that these moves were motivated by negative press coverage, telling NBC News of the shooting, “I hate even talking about it. Two people [get killed] out of tens of thousands and you get bad publicity.”

Needless to say, were the White House to order the military to interrupt vote counting, Trump would suffer even worse “publicity.”

Meanwhile, although it would be outrageous for the president to use ICE as a voter suppression tool, it would also be highly unlikely to flip elections in his favor.

“Trump wants to project ICE as an all-powerful force everywhere,” Levitt said. “And they are, as Minneapolis is proving emphatically, not. There simply aren't enough ICE personnel to blanket a modestly large city. We live in a big country. And it is hard to control through fear.”

Even in the Twin Cities — where Trump deployed some 3,000 immigration enforcement agents — ICE's presence seems to have mobilized Democratic voters, rather than deterring them. In a special election on January 27 for Minnesota House district 64A, the Democratic candidate defeated her Republican opponent by a 91-point margin. In 2024, a Democrat had won the seat by 66.6 percentage points.

“There is clearly an effort afoot to interfere in our elections and that is something that people should be alarmed about,” Weiser said. “But this can be thwarted. And it must be.”

Why it's so hard to know whether the president is okay.

President Donald Trump has been on the world stage for more than a decade now, during which he has given his fair share of rambling speeches — although he claims it's a “brilliant” way of speaking. But is the rambling getting worse?

Since Trump returned to office a year ago, the internet has gone back and forth on whether the 45th and 47th president is healthy. The rambling paired with a mysterious bruise on his hand and swollen ankles has people wondering: Is Trump okay?

New York magazine's Ben Terris, who recently wrote about Trump's health, told Today, Explained co-host Astead Herndon that the answer was quite complicated.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full episode, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

What was the catalyst for this piece?

We've all been watching him for years now, but especially in the last year, there's been more questions about him: his health, the bruising on his hands, the swollen cankles, the falling asleep in meetings.

Before sitting down with him, I'd been reading some books by members of his family. I talked to his niece, Mary Trump. Mary Trump says sometimes when she looks at Donald Trump speaking in the public square, she sees flashes of her grandfather when he had Alzheimer's. I don't know if he has it or not, but I wanted to ask him about it.

He started saying, “My father was so healthy; he had no problems. His heart couldn't be stopped.” “He did have one problem though,” Trump told me. And he said, “Late in life, he had, what's the word for it?” And he pointed to his head. And Caroline Levitt, the press secretary sitting next to me, she kind of rescued him in that moment and said, “Alzheimer's.” And he said, “Yeah, yeah, he had an Alzheimer's thing. Well, well, I don't have it.”

What are the concerns with Trump's health that you uncovered?

The story I set out to write about was to figure out whether he is healthy or not, and it kind of ended up being a story about whether the government is healthy or not. There's kind of an infection that has spread throughout Trump's inner circle where everybody who talks about him talks about him in the craziest, most North Korean-type, dear-leader way.

Instead of just saying he's healthy for an almost 80-year-old, that he's slowing down a little bit, but he's certainly healthy enough to be president, people talk about him in these terms that are just completely outrageous: superhuman, the healthiest man alive. He told me he was healthier than he was 40 years ago.

The guy doesn't exercise; he doesn't eat well. He drinks enough Diet Coke to fill a football stadium. And you just can't quite trust the people around him. And I felt like the story I published said a lot about Trump's America, not just Trump's health.

I want to ask about the bruised hand. Did you get any answers on what that is coming from or the level of severity?

When I got to the Oval Office for my interview, we shook hands. He had a really soft, warm hand, which was surprising, but on the back it was very dry. [He had] a big kind of rhino hide — like bruise on the back. I asked him about it, and what he claims is that he's on an aspirin regimen, on a much higher dose than even his doctors want him to be on. He says he's on aspirin because he wants thin blood. And because he takes so much aspirin, he bruises very easily.

The doctors confirmed this is what's going on. He says, because he bruises easily and because he shakes just a ton of hands, he's always bruising.

I'm curious about some of the logistics and how open they were to this discussion of his health.

I went into the White House early in my process and I was transparent about what I wanted to write about. I said, look, there's a big question about the president's health. Lots of people think they have the answer. I want to clarify the picture, and there's not a lot of people who really know the answer. There's Donald Trump; there's his inner circle; there's his doctors — and they made a lot of people available.

It was not clear I was going to get to talk to Donald Trump, but before I talked to him, they made time for me to go to the White House and sit down with Marco Rubio. He's got 40 jobs, and he took time out of his busy day to sit with me in Caroline Levitt's office and talk to me about how the president was, quote, “too healthy.”

He was telling these stories [that were so embarrassing] that he was debasing himself in a way. “When I ride on Air Force One, I need to take a nap, and so I hide in a blanket. I wrap myself like a mummy covering my head and I do that because I know that at some point on the flight, [Trump's] going to emerge from the cabin and start prowling the hallways to see who is awake. I want him to think it's a staffer who fell asleep. I don't want him to see his secretary of state sleeping on a couch and think, Oh, this guy is weak.”

What did his doctors tell you about his health?

When I showed up to the Oval Office, they were holding pieces of paper that said “Talking Points” on the top of it. So they had things they wanted to get through. They told me that he was as healthy as he says he is. One of them said that they did an EKG of his heart, and he appears to be a 64-year-old or a 65-year-old, according to the AI data that they found. At the end of my interview, Caroline Levitt turns to one of the doctors and says, “oh, you worked for the Obamas, didn't you?” So I asked the doctor, well, who's healthier? President Obama? Or President Trump? And Trump is sitting right there staring across the desk at the doctors making direct eye contact. And without any hesitation, the doctor says, “Oh, President Trump.”

Did you experience any skittishness when it came to reporting on Trump?

I think the fact that we went through the Biden era has made reporting on this topic easier in a way. It's still difficult because you can't get to the bottom of it, but it made people more willing to talk, maybe?

[The Biden era] made journalists more willing to go for these stories [and] for editors to assign them, because we went through this period of time with Biden where he aged in front of all of our eyes and people were too skittish in some ways to write about it.

Does that comparison feel fair?

I think it's definitely fair to draw some comparisons if for no other reason than they're both old. Donald Trump is about to be 80 years old. Just by dint of that fact, it's a worthwhile story to cover.

One reason I think that Trump is able to “get away” with some things that could be signs of aging is that they could also just be signs of Donald Trump being Donald Trump. He has been a chaotic figure for a long time. He's got this rambling way of talking. He says unhinged, outrageous stuff. He did that 15 years ago. He does that now. Are there differences in the way that he communicates between now and then? Sure, of course. But it's not as stark as if and when Biden starts to show signs of deteriorating. Because Biden was such a serious guy who kind of spoke in your traditional politician way, as soon as there was slippage, you could notice it a lot easier.

I want to ask about something that does seem similar: The president and their aides basically kept telling you not to believe your own eyes. In this instance, you have Trump dozing off in meetings and aides saying, oh, that was just his thinking pose. 

One thing that did not make it into the story — I'll talk about it with you for the first time. This is a little exclusive.

I did talk to some people from Biden's White House for this story. They didn't want to put their name out there, obviously, but one person was telling me that watching this happen did kind of feel similar to them. I have a quote [about Biden's health issues] in front of me here I can read, which is: “I think there's a world where we denied it so much that there was a delta between what people were seeing and hearing, and that led to distrust. I think that denial of the thing people are seeing — you just can't get away with that anymore. I think they're making the same kind of mistake in backing themselves into the same kind of corner that we were in.”

Part of Trump's broader success and appeal is that he can get his followers to believe his own version of reality. Do you think this strategy on this issue of his health is actually working for him? 

I think it's like a lot of issues for Trump these days: He's got a base of support that's going to believe everything, and then there's this group between his supporters and his detractors who are going to be less convinced by this.

Donald Trump does seem to be losing his ability to control his story. His poll numbers are not what he wants them to be. The midterms are trending in the wrong direction. The immigration story is not even going the way he wants to go, and that was kind of a top issue for him.

The way that he tries to control the narrative, so to speak, of his health is sort of akin to how he's trying to control everything, and I just feel like he's sort of losing some of that control. This happens to presidents; this is why they become lame ducks. It's just happening a little earlier for Trump than is traditional for a president. He's been referred to as a lame duck by pundits already, and that doesn't normally happen until the third year of a presidency.

All of the cultural Easter eggs you might have missed.

You don't have to speak Spanish to understand that Bad Bunny's blockbuster Super Bowl halftime show was a powerful one: rooted in place, history, politics, and most importantly, joy.

But if you're not intimately familiar with the oeuvre or the island, there are a lot of smaller details you might have missed — from all of the very Puerto Rican activities in the intro to Bad Bunny's light blue Puerto Rican flag.

As Vox's biggest Bad Bunny enthusiast — his full name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio — I collected some of the most striking details from his history-making performance: the first Super Bowl halftime show to be performed entirely in Spanish, building on Shakira and Jennifer Lopez's joint performance in 2020.

Here are the eight can't-miss moments from Benito's show:

This is my Super Bowl. I'm Bad Bunny's biggest fan here at Vox. I've been listening to Benito since 2016 — back in his bald stud era! — to the point where several of my coworkers texted me minutes after it was announced he was performing for the Super Bowl. I've seen him perform several times, including at his iconic residency in Puerto Rico last year. To a casual listener, it may seem that Bad Bunny only sings about bagging baddies. That's partially true. But for any Puerto Rican, from those on the archipelago to in the diaspora, there are deeper layers. I wanted y'all to feel like you, too, are in on the secret.

Benito's jersey, emblazoned with one of his last names, also features the initial number of reported deaths in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in 2017 — likely a gross undercount. That number, 64, became the center of debate, as rural parts of the archipelago suffered from immense infrastructural damage and lack of electricity and clean water. The number was also used to minimize the severity of the storm. In the months following the devastation, the governor revised the toll to 2,975 deaths. Some studies put excess deaths even higher at 4,645.

A fixture of his latest era, the casita is a pink, traditionally Puerto Rican-style concrete house. You'll find these literally anywhere on the island, but they're most popular in rural areas. Debí Tirar Más Fotos chronicles the challenges of forced gentrification caused by the island's colonial status. While the beaches and fancy apartments in San Juan may be swooped up by wealthy tourists and short-term rental hosts, what remains are the old homes in the mountains — many of which have been abandoned because of unclear wills, inability to afford maintenance, and emigration for better opportunities. (This is the case for my own family, sadly.)

Bad Bunny's celebration of the casita as a party destination, full of celebrities from Pedro Pascal and Cardi B to Alix Earle and Young Miko, cements the fight to stay on the island. It's also a fun continuation of his residency last summer on the island, where anyone who's anyone had an invite.

Another fun fact about the casita: When Bad Bunny falls through the roof into that blue room, it's a callback to the music video visualizers for his 2020 album, YHLQMDLG. He didn't get to tour that album, so this is an Easter egg for some of his real OGs.

Debí Tirar Más Fotos is a love letter to the diaspora as much as it is to those on the island. New York has the highest density of Puerto Ricans outside of Puerto Rico, living in neighborhoods like Washington Heights and Alphabet City. One of Bad Bunny's most special “if you know, you know” guests is Toñita, the owner of the Caribbean Social Club in Williamsburg, who has a shoutout in the song. High-key, it's a favorite place of mine to hang, dance, and play dominoes — a home away from home.

A powerful moment of tonight's performance was when Bad Bunny leaves the party scene in New York and passes his Grammy for best album to a child who looks uncannily similar to Liam Ramos, the 5-year-old boy who was taken by Immigration and Customs Enforcement as bait. Benito's speech against ICE plays in the background, but I think this is more of a symbolic gesture of passing on the mantle to the next generation. In either case, it speaks to faith and hope for the future.

After Hurricane Maria, there was a new push to “revitalize” Puerto Rico's economy and infrastructure. Luma, a private electricity company, became the provider for the territory. But it didn't work out as planned: Blackouts became the new norm. All the while, rich Americans moved to benefit from newly created tax breaks as an austerity regime closed down schools. “El Apagón” sings of this tension, of the desire for outsiders to leave, but also an acknowledgment that “todos quieren ser latinos” — or “everyone wants to be Latino.”

The men with the straw hats and white clothes are jibaros, a traditional subsistence farmer common in the mountains who typically use a curved machete to harvest crops and cut through sugarcane. They also have a kind of folk music that's used as the basis of many Puerto Rican cries (“lelolai”). The jibaros climbing on the powerlines are a reflection of the changing times and how they're getting left behind.

Ricky Martin — who is as much of a Puerto Rican icon as Marc Anthony, Jennifer Lopez, and Roberto Clemente — is most famous for crossing over into the American market with songs like “She Bangs” and “Livin' la Vida Loca.” He first found fame through the boy band Menudo, but it really wasn't until he started singing in English that he found international success.

Martin singing “Lo Que Paso a Hawaii” is a reclamation of his heritage. It's a song dedicated to those who stay and those who are forced to leave and change. Bad Bunny performed for the Super Bowl entirely in Spanish, something that would have been unthinkable even a decade ago. Ricky Martin has always been proudly Puerto Rican, but it feels different when he can sing in his mother tongue alone.

As Marissa Martinez wrote for Vox earlier this week, explaining the rise of calls for Puerto Rican independence:

She and other fans will be ready to shout if she sees la bandera con azul celeste, the once-suppressed 1895 light-blue version of the current flag associated with the pro-independence movement that Bad Bunny featured in the music video for “La Mudanza.”

“They killed people here for waving the flag,” he sings on that track. “That's why now I take it everywhere.”

A quick Spanish lesson, first: If you're talking about US citizens, you might think that “americano” is the direct translation. It's actually “estadounidense” (literally United States-ian). Anyway, my point here is that “americano” encompasses all of the Americas. Bad Bunny closed his performance with a shoutout to all of the Americas, from Chile to Canada, and a procession of flags. On the jumbotron behind him, a simple message shone: “The only thing more powerful than hate is love.”

The sport feels unstoppable — yet also doomed.

In a post-true crime world, the combination of celebrity and social media is piling chaos onto tragedy.

The gold medal favorite is on track to make Olympic history in Milan. The scary part? He could still get even better.

The athletes, events and simmering geopolitical crises that we're watching at this year's competition.

The Super Bowl performer's ties to a nascent independence movement are roiling Puerto Rican politics.

Are the new owners censoring you, or are they just bad at running the app?

OpenAI is running a Super Bowl LX ad that encourages people to use its coding agent to build their dream projects.

It does not, however, mention Anthropic or the rival's not-so-subtle dig at ChatGPT in its own Super Bowl ads released earlier this week.

Anthropic's ads, while not mentioning OpenAI directly, make fun of its plans to run advertisements on the platform.

""Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude,"" the tag line reads.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded to Anthropic's Super Bowl ad last week in a lengthy X post.

""First, the good part of the Anthropic ads: they are funny, and I laughed,"" Altman wrote. ""But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest.""

OpenAI's own one-minute ad, released on Sunday, is more earnest. It shows a man's lifelong pursuit of knowledge from childhood to adulthood. The ad ends with him using OpenAI's Codex tool to further his goals.

""Our job was to make a film that feels like the beginning of a builder's story with the curiosity, the frustration, and the eventual breakthroughs,"" Michael Tabtabai, OpenAI's vice president of Global Creative, said in a statement.

""We drew from the influences that shaped our own researchers and engineers, then paired that with real stories from across the country of people using ChatGPT to build in everyday life,"" he said. ""If someone watching thinks, 'I wonder if I can do that,' we've done our job.""

When Bad Bunny took the field at the 2026 Super Bowl for a historic, joyful halftime show, he wore a jersey with his Latino heritage stitched into its very fabric.

It's an apt metaphor for his performance, which eschewed explicit anti-ICE statements (he covered that at the Grammys, anyway) in favor of celebration with a side of symbolism.

Nods to the Puerto Rican singer's motherland were peppered throughout the set, which was designed to evoke the US territory's signature aesthetics, from sugar cane fields to a storefront labeled ""La Marqueta"" (a slang term for market) and various vendors selling tacos and piraguas (shaved ice). While performing ""El Apagón,"" a song about the frequent blackouts and infrastructure issues affecting Puerto Ricans, Bad Bunny brought this symbolism to the forefront, waving the Puerto Rican flag.

He also proclaimed in English, ""God bless America,"" and brandished a football printed with the phrase ""Together, We Are America."" He added in Spanish, ""We're still here."" (Puerto Rico is a US territory, and Puerto Ricans are American citizens.)

It was a stark and knowing contrast to the Latinophobia and anti-immigrant messaging hawked by the Trump administration. So much so that President Donald Trump complained online about Bad Bunny's performance and his choice to sing primarily in Spanish.

""The Super Bowl Halftime Show is absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER! It makes no sense,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social after Bad Bunny left the stage. ""Nobody understands a word this guy is saying.""

For those who understand visual storytelling, however, Bad Bunny's performance made perfect sense. He didn't need to say ""ICE out"" or declare an explicit political opinion. In keeping with the recent tradition of Super Bowl halftime shows, Bad Bunny used iconography to take a stand instead.

Bad Bunny's performance shares DNA with Beyoncé and Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl appearances, both of which used bold imagery to make strong statements.

Beyoncé's surprise appearance at Coldplay's 2016 Super Bowl halftime show became famous — and, to some, infamous — for the iconography present in her performance of her then-new single, ""Formation."" In the midst of Trump's first presidential campaign, Beyoncé and her backup dancers wore outfits that channeled the Black Panther Party, an organization formed amid the '60s Civil Rights Movement that fought for Black liberation.

The song itself isn't explicitly political. But as a celebration of identity and legacy that features lyrics about Beyoncé's parents, her daughter, and her features (""I like my negro nose with Jackson 5 nostrils""), Beyoncé performing it — with visual references to the song's themes in her and her dancers' costumes, to boot — was innately political.

It's not that Beyoncé is allergic to making explicit political statements: She famously performed in front of the word ""Feminist"" at the 2014 VMAs, and sang ""Votin' out 45, don't get out of line"" on her 2022 album ""Renaissance,"" referring to Trump as the 45th president. But when the NFL hosts musicians for the night, they've lately preferred make their statements symbolic rather than overt.

Last year, Kendrick Lamar followed suit during his own Super Bowl halftime show, outfitting himself and his dancers in red, white, and blue. Although Lamar kept the music focused on his own enemies and triumphs, he used audacious visual language to pose broader, poignantly relevant questions: Who's allowed to claim patriotism? What does it mean to be an American, especially in times of oppression and conflict?

Bad Bunny's performance raised similar questions, but offered simpler, more optimistic solutions. For the finale, he was surrounded by backup dancers, band members, and other performers holding flags from around the world; when he proclaimed ""God bless America,"" he listed out all the countries in both North and South America.

Bad Bunny is not a politician, nor can he single-handedly cure the world of hatred and division. Still, for a brief moment, on a small square of American turf, he chose to use the stage to show millions of people what that could look like.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is transforming the company's culture during his tenure, leaving a lasting impression on some current and former employees.

That includes Jeffrey Snover, a retired Microsoft chief technology officer and Google engineer, who recalled an ""actionable lesson in leadership"" he learned from Nadella in a recent blog post.

In short, he said, Nadella stressed that executives need to figure out how to succeed with the resources they have, rather than complain.

""If you are an exec and don't have the resources to support your strategy, you have the wrong strategy,"" Snover wrote. ""Quit whining and wasting time trying to get the resources to support that strategy — do your job — get a strategy that can work with the resources you have.""

In a subsequent statement shared with Business Insider, Snover said he thinks Nadella is ""the best CEO in America by a very wide margin.""

In the blog post, Snover recalled the speech Nadella gave during a meeting with Microsoft's senior executives that laid out the leadership lesson.

""Don't come whining that you don't have the resources you need. We've done our homework. We've evaluated the portfolio, considered the opportunities, and allocated our available resources to those opportunities,"" Nadella said, according to Snover. ""That is what you have to work with. Your job is to manufacture success with the resources you've been allocated.""

Snover wrote that Nadella, who became CEO in 2014, told executives they could control only two things: How they managed their teams and how they allocated resources.

""And I want to be clear with you. If you are in this room, you need to deliver outsized success. To do that, you will need to allocate resources ahead of conventional wisdom​,"" Nadella said. ""Conventional wisdom will generate conventional success, and that won't allow you to stay in this room. You need to have courage and be bold.""

Snover, who left Microsoft in 2022, said Nadella's speech provided executives with a framework for thriving.

""Satya was not giving us a pep talk, he was giving us an architecture for success,"" Snover wrote.

In a follow-up blog post, Snover wrote that project proposals were gathered ahead of the meeting, so it was the ""Lord of the Flies/Game of Thrones stage of resource allocation.""

""Resource allocation isn't just about money; it's the most effective weapon for killing redundancy and enforcing architectural alignment,"" Snover wrote. ""If you can't afford to build your own silo, you finally start acting like a platform company.""

Under Nadella, Microsoft's company culture shifted from being highly competitive toward an emphasis on teamwork, including implementing an evaluation system that rewarded collaboration.

As a mom of three kids, Christina Mott had been counting the days until her oldest son, Colton, got his driver's license.

It falls on her to drive each of them — age 10, 12, and 16 — to three different charter schools every day, and then to extracurriculars and social outings. ""Having him able to drive himself would free up a lot of time,"" she says. If only.

While out one day on his learner's permit, Colton rolled through a red light and a stop sign. He panicked and decided to put his license on hold indefinitely. ""Getting in crashes, that's something that scares me a lot,"" Colton explains.

That means his mom is still chauffeuring three kids around their Northern California suburb. Christina, who's 46, says a lot of her fellow parents are going through the same thing: Teenagers are slamming the brakes on the time-honored rite of passage of getting a license at 16, either out of fear or because they're put off by the process or the costs. And that means a lot of Gen X parents are stuck behind the wheel longer than they bargained for.

""When I was 16, we didn't think this way about driving at all. Driving meant freedom!"" Christina says.

Even so, she admits Colton doesn't feel quite as ready for a license as she was at 16. ""He's not very observant and tends to live in his own world,"" she says. ""I don't think, without GPS, that he would even know how to get to the grocery store from our house that we've lived in for eight years. So, the idea of him dealing with traffic lights and other drivers makes me nervous, too.""

In 1983, roughly half of US 16-year-olds had a driver's license. That number fell to 25% in 2022, according to data from the Federal Highway Administration. Most teens will eventually get their licenses, the data shows — they're just waiting a lot longer.

Even Dara Khosrowshahi, the CEO of Uber — a beneficiary of the Delayed Driver trend — says it's caught him off guard. In an interview on the Verge's ""Decoder"" podcast last May, Khosrowshahi revealed he'd been struggling to convince his 18-year-old son to get a license.

""It drives me crazy,"" Khosrowshahi said. ""I don't know about you, but did you get a license the minute you could drive? It was just such a thing. It was a goal in life. It represented freedom.""

Delayed Driving goes hand in hand with a broader trend: Gen Z is falling behind older generations across a range of social markers. They're having less sex and waiting longer to couple off and start families. They don't go out as much and drink less alcohol, in part because it's so easy to socialize, shop, and order meals online.

""If you think of why those 16-year-olds — 30 or 50 years ago — were so eager to get their license, a lot of it had to do with wanting to drink and have sex,"" says Jeffrey Jensen Arnett, a professor of psychology at Clark University in Massachusetts and author of ""Emerging Adulthood: The Winding Road from the Late Teens Through the Twenties.""

That's still the case — Gen Z is just slowing down the march into adulthood.

Add to that the convenience of rideshare apps like Uber and the promise of self-driving cars, and the urgency of getting a license has diminished. ""They don't see their future as necessarily involving a car,"" Arnett said. He believes the trend will be a boon for autonomous vehicles.

The situation has sent a lot of Gen X parents to online forums like Reddit to complain that they're ""chauffeuring kids old enough to drive themselves."" One described her kid as a ""21-year-old passenger prince.""

Rather than teenagers begging their parents to let them drive, more parents are the ones doing the begging.

""It's almost like pushing him off the cliff,"" Giselle Rodriguez Greenwood, who lives in the suburbs of Houston, says of her 17-year-old son's resistance to getting a license.

It's the same for his classmates, nearly all of whom still depend on their parents or their friends' parents to get them around. ""It becomes 'rock, paper, scissors' as far as who's going to take who to whose house,"" Greenwood says. ""We have a text thread of lacrosse parents, and that's where we make the plea for help.""

Like Mott, Greenwood is not unsympathetic to her teen's reluctance. Houston is consistently ranked among the most unsafe cities for driving. She wonders if she's more of a helicopter parent than she realizes. ""Sometimes, I fear I may have imparted my fears on him,"" she says.

Indeed, a lot of parents worry about pushing their teens to drive before they're ready — or have a handle on their screen use. A 2025 study by Mass General Brigham found that teenage drivers spent about 21% of car rides glancing at their phones, and about 26% of those glances lasted 2 seconds or longer. Even if they put their phones away, growing up with screens can change how Gen Zers navigate the road.

Still, driving is an essential skill, and Greenwood plans to take a harder line with her younger son, who's 14. ""I'm just throwing him behind the wheel as soon as he can,"" she says. ""I'm not doing this again.""

Even a strong parental nudge isn't always enough to get a kid to the DMV. When Sarah Wilson, a mother of three in Nashville, stopped offering to ferry her 16-year-old around town, her daughter didn't sign up for driver's ed; she started taking the bus. She's now in college, and still doesn't know how to drive. She gets around mostly on her bike or by catching a ride with friends.

""It becomes frustrating when she can't help with long drives or simple errands,"" says Wilson, who's 50. ""It's a form of independence I want her to have, even if she's been slow to claim it.""

Robert Roble, a Lyft driver in Auburn, Georgia, a small city 42 miles from Atlanta, has noticed an uptick in the number of driving-age teens requesting rides to afterschool jobs, sports practice, or the mall. ""I had a 22-year-old this week that hadn't gotten his driver's license yet,"" says Roble, who's 59.

Both Lyft and Uber have reported that fewer Gen Z drivers have translated to more business for rideshare companies. ""The data shows that most 16-year-olds, at this point, are not that interested in a driver's license,"" Uber president Andrew Macdonald said in a recent interview.

For some families, even the occasional rideshare surge pricing makes more financial sense when you account for the combined costs of driving school, an extra car, and the price of gas.

The cost of a used car has soared in recent years, thanks in part to tariffs and supply chain slowdowns, as have monthly auto insurance premiums. Meanwhile, fewer public schools offer free driver's ed programs, the global research firm IBISWorld reported last year, adding to the logistical and financial hurdles of getting a driver's license.

In a few states, including New Jersey, Illinois, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, licensed teenagers are limited to how many friends they can pick up in their cars. In California, for example, a teenager under 18 has to wait a year before they can carpool with all their friends. The law prohibits having anyone under 20 in their car without an adult over 25 present. ""With that restriction, it takes a lot of the fun out of it,"" says Colton, the Northern California teen.

Nina McCollum, who lives in Ohio, says cost was a factor in her 16-year-old son not immediately getting his license. The state requires formal driver's education to apply for a license, and McCollum was hit with sticker shock when she looked into it. ""The cheapest I've found from a reputable provider is like $700,"" says McCollum, who's 57.

The family decided to delay the classes for a few months, and McCollum has been giving her son informal lessons in the meantime.

What has surprised her is that it often feels like it's her — rather than her teenager — who's antsy for him to drive. None of her son's close friends have licenses, even though they're old enough; they're all dependent on their parents to drive them to band practice and basketball games.

""It's really hard to force a 16-year-old to do things,"" she says. ""It's not like he's going out all the time, and I can ground him.""

The lack of enthusiasm to drive doesn't change the fact that most of America is heavily car-dependent. More than 9 in 10 households have at least one car, and 87% of people drive every day.

Unless you live in a few walkable US cities with solid mass transit, not driving means relying on other people for carpools, timing your outings to bus schedules, spending a lot on Taxis and rideshares, or walking in areas simply not built for it.

For years, that's how Alma Benitez got by. ""Since I come from a first-gen household, the mentality is that the man is a provider and is always able to drive you around,"" says Benitez, who's now 24. As a license-less teen, she relied on her dad and brother for rides; otherwise, she walked or took public transportation in White Plains, New York.

Ultimately, it held her back. ""Because I didn't drive, most of my jobs and school locations would have to be a commutable walk or bus transportation ride,"" she said. ""So it kind of limited me.""

She finally got her license three years ago, when she was 21. Benitez now makes TikToks for new drivers, offering instructions for how to pump gas or make smooth turns. Most of the comments under her videos are from people in their late 20s. ""A lot of people are really scared to get on the road,"" she says.

Back in California, Colton Mott is trying to win back his confidence about driving. He's again taking driving lessons and has an appointment for his test at his local DMV. His mom signed him up for both.

""I feel really good about him driving again,"" she says. ""He's been asking to drive every day.""

Bad Bunny used his Super Bowl spotlight to make a political statement — but not the one many were anticipating.

The Puerto Rican singer highlighted the importance of diversity during his halftime show on Sunday in San Francisco, without mentioning Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

At the end of his set, right after his song ""Café Con Ron,"" his backup dancers ran out carrying flags of countries in North and South America. In English, the singer said, ""God Bless America,"" then listed out the names of all countries on both continents.

He sang before a billboard with the words ""THE ONLY THING MORE POWERFUL THAN HATE IS LOVE.""

He also held up a football emblazoned with the words: ""TOGETHER, WE ARE AMERICA.""

He then sang the last song in his set, his popular track ""DTMF,"" before closing up the show.

Bad Bunny was joined by rapper Cardi B, Puerto Rican singer-songwriter Ricky Martin, Chilean-American actor Pedro Pascal, and Lady Gaga, singing her hit song ""Die with a Smile.""

While Bad Bunny did not mention ICE at the Super Bowl, the singer has slammed violence linked to immigration in recent days.

During the Grammys last week, in his speech accepting the album of the year award for ""Debí Tirar Más Fotos,"" Bad Bunny said, ""Before I say thanks to God, I'm going to say: ICE out.""

He dedicated his award to ""all the people that had to leave their homeland, their country, to follow their dreams.""

Singers Billie Eilish and Olivia Dean also made immigration-related statements during their acceptance speeches at the Grammys.

This comes after immigration violence-linked protests erupted nationwide. On January 31, there were nationwide strikes against ICE. People poured into the streets, protesting the fatal shootings of Minneapolis residents Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal immigration officers.

The leaders of Minnesota's biggest corporations, like Target and Cargill, called for peace in an open letter to government officials in January.

Big Tech employees from companies like Google, Amazon, Apple, and Spotify have signed multiple petitions, urging their CEOs to press the White House to abolish ICE and divest from corporate contracts with the agency.

This year's Super Bowl brought out more than just fans in jerseys.

Hollywood stars and CEOs were also in attendance, and many wore bold looks and status symbols that were hard to miss.

Tom Brady, Jay-Z, and Travis Kelce were just a few of the people who brought their fashion A-game.

Here's a look at the luxury pieces that made for standout looks, from designer outerwear to expensive watches.

No one showed that better than Travis Kelce.

He looked sharp at the big game in a black double-breasted Fear of God blazer, which retails for $2,200. He accessorized with a pair of Chrome Hearts Cliterally sunglasses.

Jay-Z and Blue Ivy Carter were two of them, making their annual appearance at the game together.

The rapper wore a Roc Nation x Paper Planes x NFL Super Bowl LX black hoodie featuring the slogan ""The Game Needs Me"" on the front. It retails for $140 on the NFL site.

Meanwhile, his daughter rocked a black Off-White varsity bomber jacket. She paired it with a Balenciaga Neo Cagole City bag in denim, which retails for $3,500.

Tom Brady did just that when he showed up to the Super Bowl in a custom NFL MVP varsity jacket with his name on it.

He also appeared to wear a blue ceramic Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Perpetual Calendar, a watch he's been spotted with several times before.

The timepiece can be found on the resale market for prices upward of $479,000.

Like Tom Brady, Bad Bunny wore an Audemars Piguet — the $75,700 Royal Oak Selfwinding watch — at the Super Bowl.

Jay-Z, on the other hand, was one of the attendees who wore a Patek Philippe. His $394,000 timepiece, the Grand Complications 6102P-001, had a celestial design.

Travis Scott arrived at the Super Bowl in vintage Chanel. He wore a cream linen baseball jersey with the interlocking CC logo and accessorized with several gold chains, including one featuring a crucified Jesus pendant on an anchor.

He also wore what appeared to be diamond stud earrings, a Casio calculator watch on his wrist, and yes, his orange iPhone 17 Pro made its way into the look, too.

Travis Scott wasn't the only celebrity to wear sparkling accessories.

During Bad Bunny's halftime show, Lady Gaga made a guest appearance while wearing her massive diamond engagement ring and a cascading pair of Chopard earrings.

SpaceX has made its Super Bowl debut ahead of a potential record-breaking IPO.

The rocket company ran its first Super Bowl ad for its Starlink satellite internet on Sunday, the first time any of Elon Musk's companies have run an ad at the showpiece event.

The 30-second spot features audio from a speech by legendary science-fiction author Arthur C. Clarke, set to footage of SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Starship rocket boosters returning to Earth.

It shows Starlink operating in a series of remote locations and touts the satellite internet service's mission of ""fast, affordable internet, available everywhere.""

The ad marks a departure for Musk's companies, which have in the past shunned advertising in favor of using the billionaire's outspoken public persona for publicity.

Tesla reportedly laid off its entire marketing team during widespread workforce cuts in 2024, while SpaceX has typically relied on eye-catching rocket tests, such as its Starship booster catch, to boost its public profile.

Both companies have started running advertising in recent years across a number of platforms, including Musk's X, and Starlink has previously featured in Super Bowl ads run by partners such as T-Mobile.

SpaceX running its own stand-alone Super Bowl ad is a significant development, with 30-second ad slots costing between $8 million and $10 million on average this year, per broadcaster NBCUniversal.

It comes as SpaceX gears up for a public offering later this year that could value the rocket company at as much as $1.5 trillion.

Last week, Musk announced that SpaceX would merge with his AI startup xAI, in a move the world's richest man said would help launch a network of solar-powered orbital data centers to train powerful AI models.

SpaceX's recent success has been driven in large part by Starlink, which uses a constellation of more than 9,000 low-orbit satellites to provide wireless internet. In December, the company said Starlink has 9 million customers and is active in 155 countries.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Pronnoy Goswami, 31, who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. The following has been edited for length and clarity.

When I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in 2022, I thought: Why me?

I didn't have lots of bad habits, I hadn't abused my body, and it took me a long time to accept what was happening to me.

I considered giving up my dream of solving meaningful problems in tech at scale, taking a career break to focus on my health, and leaving the US to go back to my home country of India.

Ultimately, I stayed in the US and continued with my career while making huge changes to my lifestyle and work routine. I'm proud of what I've achieved in tech in spite of my adversities, and along the way, I've found my voice and a new vision of success.

When I first got sick in 2021, I was working in Washington as a software engineer at Microsoft. Previously, I'd spent two years in software engineering at McKinsey, and a few months interning at PayPal. I now work at a large enterprise software company.

I was on a trip with my partner just before Thanksgiving when I had rectal bleeding and felt weak, but I didn't think it was anything more serious than hemorrhoids or food poisoning. My symptoms kept getting worse, even after I consulted doctors and took medication. I was going to the restroom 15 to 20 times a day, and I lost a lot of weight.

By Independence Day, I couldn't drive because I had excessive stomach cramps while sitting, like someone was putting a knife in my stomach and twisting it.

Doctors noticed my gut was inflamed, and referred me to a gastroenterologist. I was very scared.

A colonoscopy showed I have ulcerative colitis, a type of inflammatory bowel disease that causes symptoms like abdominal pain and rectal bleeding.

I'm used to putting 100% into my work, and when I was diagnosed in 2022, I'd been working on projects at Microsoft I felt were impactful. I took three to four weeks of sick leave, then returned to work, but I was completely remote for a year after my diagnosis.

My body struggles to absorb nutrients, and I get tired very quickly. I've had to make many dietary changes to manage flare-ups, including cutting out caffeine, alcohol, lactose, chile, and red meat.

When my wife and I went on honeymoon in Hawaii in August 2025, we planned the trip down to the restaurants I could eat at and what I'd order. But then I ate something I hadn't planned at a lūʻau, and I was sick for two days, which was disheartening.

At first, I was scared to tell people about my condition, but when I started sharing with my colleagues, I found people empathized and judged me according to my merits.

I have bad days related to my condition 20% of the time, and sometimes have to step away for appointments and procedures. For example, I have a colonoscopy every year because ulcerative colitis puts me at higher risk of getting colorectal cancer. I always try to catch up with tasks in my own time, and accept that I have to achieve the same things as others in less time.

I left Microsoft and started working at a large enterprise software company in 2023. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the allure of startups is all around. However, I'm not physically or mentally ready to take the leap of faith to work at one yet. The stability of my current job is vital for my health.

I also need to be careful with what jobs I consider, because a workplace might not be a good fit if it has a strict policy of being in the office five days a week and doesn't make accommodations. Plus, I'm very happy where I am.

Before I got sick, I took my health for granted, but I've started treating my body like a temple and am careful with how I'm spending my energy. I've come to define success as being healthy, because it helps me solve problems at work better.

It's also given me a voice. My diagnosis made me want to be more purposeful with my time, so I started exploring creative passions, like writing a newsletter and technical blogs. I want to connect with like-minded people and not live in a shell.

When I look back at what I've achieved in my career since my diagnosis, I feel God has been kind to me. I've done interesting, cutting-edge work in tech, like building important infrastructure.

But I'm not done yet. I'm still in the early innings of my career, and I have a long way to go.

Microsoft declined to respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Andrew Athias, 33, a Philadelphia-based digital marketer and content creator. It has been edited for length and clarity.

I was one of the 500 bunches of dancing grass at Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime show. I got paid $18.70 per hour for the gig, but I would've done it for free.

I'm a big Bad Bunny fan. I've been to three of his concerts since my girlfriend introduced me to him in 2021.

I found the grass gig through a company called Backlit, which handles finding extras for the halftime show. I found it last year when I saw Kendrick Lamar at the Super Bowl halftime show, but I forgot about it until Bad Bunny was announced as Super Bowl's headliner in October, and I decided to apply.

I was one of the few crazy people to fly over from the East Coast to be part of the field cast. I flew out to San Francisco from Philadelphia in the middle of a snowstorm and have been out here for two weeks, rehearsing for the big day, and it has been worth it.

The requirements for the role were pretty basic. You had to be no taller than six feet, no shorter than five feet seven inches, and of an athletic build.

The listing said we had to be able to wear a 40-plus-pound costume and to be comfortable dancing in proximity with other performers for long periods. Other than that, we had to measure every part of our body from head to toe, elbow to floor, shoulder to clavicle, etc. Those were the only requirements.

They didn't tell us we'd be wearing a grass costume and kept it super vague.

My part was actually really easy. They just told me where to stand, and they said, ""Don't move. Stand here and be one with the grass.""

The suits were heavy and uncomfortable. Every now and again, you'll have a blade of plastic grass going places where grass should not go. Fortunately, we were given some protective goggles.

There were definitely times when we were wearing the suits for about six or seven hours because they had to make alterations. There were about eight practices in total, with the last three lasting 12 hours each.

But the production crew did their best to make this suit as wearable as possible; they listened to every complaint and tried to fix it.

And getting to see behind the scenes of the production was a treat.

It was really cool to see Bad Bunny perform just a foot away. But because he was in LA for the Grammys during some of our rehearsals, the crew had a Bad Bunny stand-in they called ""Good Rabbit.""

One of the other things they asked for in the application was whether you had marching band experience or experience in the entertainment industry. I was in a collegiate a capella group, so I'm not scared of performing in front of big crowds.

But it's definitely different when you have a stadium full of people vibing, moving, grooving to Bad Bunny's music.

I spent about $2,600 on flights, hotels, and a rental car for the two weeks. I'm a content creator without a full time job now, so I didn't have to take any paid time off for this.

The hardest part of the whole thing wasn't the long hours or the heavy costume, but rather keeping quiet about it. They made us sign an NDA to not talk about it or post anything on social media for two weeks.

So when I saw people posting about what his setlist was going to be, it was so hard to have so much knowledge and power and not be able to do anything with it.

I told only a very small handful of people that I was going to San Francisco and would be involved in the half-time show.

I didn't tell them what I was dressed as. I didn't tell them where to look for me on the field. All I said was, ""You're going to see me. You just didn't know that you saw me.""

Bad Bunny took the field at Super Bowl LX on Sunday just one week after he made history at the Grammys, winning three awards for his latest album, 2025's ""Debí Tirar Más Fotos,"" including album of the year.

Fans were eager to hear hits from across the Puerto Rican rapper's catalog, which also includes blockbuster albums ""YHLQMDLG"" (2020) and ""Un Verano Sin Ti"" (2022).

""I just want people to have fun. It's going to be a huge party,"" Bad Bunny said at a press conference hosted by Apple Music on Tuesday.

Bad Bunny was joined onstage by surprise guests Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin. The performance also featured brief cameos from stars like Jessica Alba, Pedro Pascal, and Cardi B, who collaborated with Bad Bunny on her diamond-certified single ""I Like It.""

Here's every song in Bad Bunny's halftime show setlist, listed in chronological order.

""Tití Me Preguntó,"" which translates to ""Auntie Asked Me,"" is the fourth track on ""Un Verano Sin Ti,"" later released as a single.

""Tití me preguntó si tengo mucha' novia', mucha' novia' / Hoy tengo a una, mañana otra, pero no hay boda,"" Bad Bunny raps in the chorus. (""Auntie asked me if I have a lot of girlfriends, a lot of girlfriends / Today I have one, tomorrow I'll have another, but there's no wedding."")

""Yo Perreo Sola,"" which loosely translates to ""I Twerk Alone,"" was released as a single from ""YHLQMDLG.""

Bad Bunny said he wrote the song from a woman's perspective (hence the feminine adjective, ""sola,"" in the title) to address sexual harassment in clubs.

""I wanted a woman's voice to sing it — 'yo perreo sola' — because it doesn't mean the same thing when a man sings it,"" he told Rolling Stone. ""But I do feel like that woman sometimes.""

The music video ends with a title card that reads, ""Si no quiere bailar contigo, respeta, ella perrea sola."" (""If she doesn't want to dance with you, respect her, she twerks alone."")

""Safaera,"" a collaboration with Ñengo Flow and Puerto Rican duo Jowell & Randy, is the 14th track on ""YHLQMDLG.""

""Party"" is the 11th track on ""Un Verano Sin Ti."" The studio version features Rauw Alejandro.

""Voy a Llevarte Pa PR,"" meaning ""I'm Going to Take You to Puerto Rico,"" is the second track on ""Debí Tirar Más Fotos.""

""Eoo,"" which samples ""Perreo Baby"" by Héctor & Tito, is the 15th track on ""Debí Tirar Más Fotos."" It won the 2026 Grammy Award for best global music performance.

""Monaco"" is the second track on Bad Bunny's fifth solo studio album, ""Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana.""

Lady Gaga made an appearance during Bad Bunny's performance to sing a salsa-style version of her hit duet with Bruno Mars (sans Mars).

""Baile Inolvidable"" is the third track on ""Debí Tirar Más Fotos."" The studio version features live salsa arrangements, recorded by students from San Juan's Escuela Libre de Música, according to a press release for the album.

""Nuevayol"" is the opening track on ""Debí Tirar Más Fotos.""

The song features a sample of ""Un Verano en Nueva York,"" or ""A Summer in New York,"" originally performed by Andy Montañez and El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico.

""This album is the result of the experiences that have led me to get to know myself better, even getting to know the rhythms I enjoy most—the ones I truly enjoy singing and creating,"" Bad Bunny said in a statement.

""I am Puerto Rican, I am Caribbean, and my music, my culture, my country's history run through my veins, from plena to reggaeton,"" he continued. ""At the peak of my career and popularity, I want to show the world who I am.""

Bad Bunny enlisted Ricky Martin to sing ""Lo Que Le Pasó a Hawaii,"" a song about American colonization.

The two Latino singers have worked together in the past; Martin contributed backing vocals to Bad Bunny's 2019 single ""Caro"" and made a cameo in the 2020 music video for ""Yo Visto Así.""

""El Apagón,"" which translates to ""The Power Outage,"" is the 16th track on ""Un Verano Sin Ti."" It was later released as the album's seventh single.

""Café Con Ron"" is the 12th track on ""Debí Tirar Más Fotos."" The studio version features the Puerto Rican ensemble Los Pleneros de la Cresta.

""DTMF"" is the 16th track on ""Debí Tirar Más Fotos,"" later released as the album's fourth single.

It was nominated for both record and song of the year at the 2026 Grammys, but the awards went to ""Luther"" by Kendrick Lamar and SZA and ""Wildflower"" by Billie Eilish, respectively.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Asif Saleem, a financial services go-to-market lead for Japan and the Asia Pacific region at Google. Asif is the father of 13-year-old Usman Asif and 18-year-old Shanzey Asif. It's been edited for length and clarity.

It's important for parents to help kids understand we're going through a very transformative time. This is like the era when the internet or mobile first emerged. With AI, it may be even bigger.

Kids need to understand this and embrace the technology. Whatever they end up studying — computer science, English, or philosophy — they can make AI part of it.

I was curious about Cursor and some of the other vibecoding tools, so I joined a few ""Code with AI"" weekend sessions for executives.

I really enjoyed it. Within a matter of hours, we were able to develop different applications. I developed a statement analyzer for a financial services system.

Once I came back home, I spoke to my family about it and showed them the demo. My children, Usman and Shanzey, are both tech-savvy, so that drove their interest. They attended the same course a few weeks later.

They were the youngest in the class. The good part was that they were completely independent, so I let them be on their own. That's how they ventured into vibe coding and participated in Cursor's 24-hour weekend hackathon in Singapore.

They've become more curious about things. Through vibe coding, they've learned to be more creative and to use technology to understand how things work.

Neither of them has a formal technology background — they're not software developers — but they've been able to think through ideas, be more creative, and use technology to solve problems.

Technology is the biggest enabler. The question is how humans use it — whether for good or bad. If it's for good, what are the guardrails?

Using it for good means creating value, solving real challenges, and making information more accessible.

Managing screentime is the reason we developed a reward system for Usman because he's young and he loves gaming. Gaming comes as a reward for achieving goals. Those goals include making your own breakfast, making your bed, or helping clean the house.

When Shanzey is studying, she can't use AI for the content she's creating — it can't even be AI-inspired. It has to be her original work.

That's super important because schools validate whether output is AI-generated. The same applies to Usman.

It's important to have both physical and digital skills. Usman plays football because physical activity is important at his age. Shanzey is focused on school right now — her exams are very important, and getting good grades matters.

I'd say my role is more like a coach — brainstorming with them. My wife does the same, helping them think through ideas and keeping them honest.

I'm often busy with work, so a lot of this couldn't be done without my wife's help.

There's nothing better than hands-on learning. That's something I've learned over the last few years.

You will face challenges and go through them. Parents should get their kids to do things, give them challenges, and nurture them as they work through those challenges. With hands-on experience, they can get better results faster.

With building an app, we co-create the idea, but then the important part is making it happen and reporting back on progress.

At Google, I work with enterprise customers trying to transform their businesses with AI. I can see what's happening on the ground and how things are changing.

I also see a lot of young talent at Google. They come in thinking about creating apps and learning skills, and I mentor some of them as well.

It's important to communicate this to my family. I spent time helping them understand how the world is changing and why it's important for them to understand AI.

It's not about running away from technology. AI will keep advancing, and the only thing you can do is be accustomed to it, no matter what you want to become.

We're now in a situation where we have very intelligent large language models, and we're also moving toward agentic AI, where you can work with agents that help you do a lot more. Speed and agility are improving, and you can now work within larger ecosystems that combine humans and machines, achieving much more.

If you know how to coexist and let machines do meaningful work with you, that's a skill to aspire to.

Bad Bunny's Super Bowl LX halftime show was more than a hit-filled performance — it was a carefully staged cultural statement.

Beyond the headline moments, the show was packed with intentional details, from visual symbolism to casting choices, that were easy to miss in real time.

We've rounded up the moments you might not have caught, and why they mattered.



Bad Bunny — born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio — wore a white Zara football jersey emblazoned with his last name, ""Ocasio,"" and the number ""64.""

The number set off widespread online speculation about its meaning, with theories ranging from personal and musical references to Hurricane Maria, but no definitive explanation has been confirmed.

Bad Bunny's halftime show featured several celebrity cameos from the likes of Lady Gaga, Ricky Martin, Pedro Pascal, Cardi B, Karol G, Jessica Alba, and Young Miko.

Lady Gaga appeared in a blue dress and sang a salsa rendition of her chart-topping hit ""Die With a Smile,"" while fellow Puerto Rican native Ricky Martin took to the stage to perform Bad Bunny's ""Lo Que Pasó a Hawaii.""

Maria Antonia Cay, known as Toñita, also made a cameo, briefly appearing onstage to hand Bad Bunny a drink. She runs Caribbean Social Club in Williamsburg, one of the last Puerto Rican social clubs in New York City.

A couple featured in Bad Bunny's performance actually got married during the set, league sources confirmed to ESPN.

The outlet said that the couple had originally invited Bad Bunny to their wedding. Instead, the singer invited them to get married during his show.

Toward the end of his performance, Bad Bunny switched to English and said, ""God Bless America."" He went on to list countries from South America up to North America as dancers walked behind him holding the respective flags — he finished with the United States and Canada.

He then closed his performance by holding up a football stamped with the words ""Together, We Are America"" and spiking it on the field.

During his performance of ""El Apagón,"" a song whose title translates to ""the power outage,"" Bad Bunny leaned into the track's themes about the frequent blackouts in Puerto Rico.

The stage featured his dancers dressed as jíbaros, or traditional Puerto Rican farmers, who began climbing utility poles that sparked and exploded.

Bad Bunny brought Puerto Rico to Levi's Stadium by covering the stage in greenery inspired by Vega Baja, where he grew up.

In another stadium, that kind of lush landscape would typically be created by wheeling carts of plant props onto the field, Bruce Rodgers, whose company Tribe Inc. handled the show's production design, told Wired.

But NFL rules limited how many carts could be used to protect Levi's Stadium's natural grass, so the team dressed performers as plants to get the same effect, Rodgers said

Bad Bunny's halftime performance featured several cultural symbols of Puerto Rico, including sugar cane fields, a piragua stand, and a casita.

As fireworks lit up the sky to mark the end of Bad Bunny's halftime performance, a stadium screen displayed the message, ""The only thing more powerful than hate is love.""

The quote echoed a line from the singer's Grammy acceptance speech last week.

While accepting the award for best música urbana album, Bad Bunny called out ICE.

""We're not savage,"" he said. ""We're not animals. We're not aliens. We are humans, and we are Americans.""

Later that night, Bad Bunny also made history as the first artist to win Album of the Year with an all-Spanish record.

You don't usually expect restaurant-style service at 35,000 feet — but Turkish Airlines still staffs a 'flying chef' in business class on its longest routes.

These rare culinary specialists, who are separate from flight attendants, take food orders, plate meals in the galley, and oversee premium service on long-haul flights.

The role is designed to make dining feel closer to a restaurant than standard airline catering — but chefs don't actually cook from scratch due to flight safety rules. They use ovens to heat and finish pre-prepared meals and then arrange the presentation.

These chefs also take customer feedback from the air to help improve and develop meals in catering kitchens on the ground.

I recently experienced the unique service on a 10-hour flight from Istanbul to New York in January. Considering Turkish won Skytrax's 2025 awards for Europe's best business class and best business class catering, I was eager to see how the seat and food measured up.

I strategically chose the Boeing 787 for its modern business cabin; the Boeing 777 that also flies the route doesn't have the nicer design.

Between the lie-flat seat, the large TV, and the restaurant-style meals, the cabin felt like my living room on a lazy Saturday night.

I slept well and appreciated the wide variety of food, from poached eggs and swordfish to a trolley full of savory appetizers.

Here's what the full experience was like. Business Insider paid a media rate for the business class upgrade to New York.

Turkish's Istanbul business class lounge is unreal, with cooked-to-order meals like omelettes and kebabs, drink stations, and sleep suites that feel like mini hotel rooms.

My layover time qualified me for a suite, but they're first-come, first-served — I was lucky to wait only about 15 minutes.

The bed was so comfortable I slept five hours straight, with a shared bathroom and shower just across the hall.

I chose seat 8A, in the last row, for privacy and to be among the first to deplane. Although it's right by the galley and lavatory nearest the boarding door, I didn't notice much noise with headphones on.

Most Turkish business cabins don't have doors. Some A350s do, and the airline is planning a new ""Crystal Business Class"" with sliding doors, but most planes — including the 787 I flew on — still don't.

It's not a dealbreaker by any means, and the seat wings help cocoon the space a bit, but there is less overall privacy than with a door.

The business class seats lie fully flat, and mine felt both spacious and cozy. I could comfortably sleep on my stomach, and I particularly liked the mattress pad and the dual-texture blanket, which has a soft plush on one side.

I also appreciated the 1-2-1 cabin that let me freely reach the aisle. Many of Turkish's old planes still have 2-3-2 layouts that force middle and window-seat travelers to crawl over their neighbor to reach the restroom.

The seat had multiple storage spots: a cabinet, a footrest cubby, and a slim seatback pocket — plus an overhead bin to myself.

I stashed my purse, Kindle, chargers, boots, backpack, and jacket without feeling cramped.

Turkish handed out gender-specific kits with lotion, dental items, socks, an eye mask, and a hair tie for women. The case can be reused as a travel bag on future trips.

Slippers were also provided.

The seat's television was large and fully controllable via a handheld remote. I watched ""The Big Bang Theory,"" ""Fast and Furious,"" and an Agatha Christie-style whodunit called ""Murder at the Embassy.""

Instead of a flight attendant, a dedicated flying chef takes orders, plates meals, and preps appetizer and dessert carts.

Most of the menu — like meats and soups — are fully or nearly fully cooked on the ground in airline kitchens, but finished in the air by the chef and cabin crew using onboard ovens.

The cabin crew still hands out drinks and hot towels, but with meals covered, I imagine they can better focus on other tasks.

All of the food was served on real dishware and with flatware — no cheap plastic.

Turkish offers a ""dining-on-demand"" strategy that lets passengers choose when they want to eat.

For example, I slept a few hours after breakfast before requesting tea, though the crew member also brought me a small sandwich. It was simple — handcrafted with a roll, lettuce, and cheese — but perfect while I watched a movie.

There were also free snacks available throughout the flight, like popcorn, fruit, mixed nuts, chocolate, cookies, and chips.

The breakfast started with appetizers: fresh juice, fruit salad, cheeses, smoked turkey, marinated olives, and bread with butter and jam.

The entrée options included poached eggs with a savory sauce called shakshuka, spinach-and-cheese stuffed pastries and flatbreads (börek and gözleme), and sweet curd crepes with fruit and berry sauce.

I had the poached eggs, which were prepared on the ground but were still fluffy with a perfectly runny yolk on the plane.

The second meal included a huge range of appetizers: octopus salad, salmon tartare, shrimp salad, artichoke salad, fried aubergine, beef patties, chicken salad, cheese, red pepper soup, creamy pea soup, and Köpoğlu (essentially Turkish eggplant caviar).

Everything was arranged on a trolley by the chef and rolled down the galley for passengers to pick and choose; the presentation made the experience feel more fancy, and everything was tasty.

I had never seen swordfish on an airplane menu and couldn't resist trying it. It looked a little dull, but it was well-seasoned and more flavorful than the white fish I've had on other flights or even in some restaurants.

The other lunch options were grilled spring lamb chops and ricotta cappellacci. The Turkish desserts included eclairs, pear strudel, peach ice cream, and assorted cheeses and fruits.

Besides Turkish, select Saudia, Austrian Airlines, and Garuda Indonesia flights feature onboard chefs.

Turkish's chefs, staffed through catering partner DO&CO, also spend time at meal-prep facilities, providing feedback and helping maintain quality — a hands-on approach that shows in the in-flight service.

I rarely check luggage, but I had too many souvenirs this time.

Luckily, my bag survived the transfer from Zagreb, Croatia, and arrived in New York safe and sound.

Databricks said Monday it has raised $5 billion in funding and $2 billion in new debt capacity at a $134 billion valuation. 

The privately held data analytics software company also said that its annualized revenue exceeded $5.4 billion for the January quarter, up 65% year over year, while delivering free cash flow over the past year. 

That type of performance might whet the appetites of public market investors, who have not seen many new issuances of technology companies with high growth rates. Databricks is prepared to go public ""when the time is right,"" co-founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi told CNBC in an interview. 

This year is shaping up to potentially feature notable tech IPOs. Fast-growing artificial intelligence labs Anthropic and OpenAI are also considering 2026 initial public offerings, according to people familiar with the matter. Elon Musk said in December that his rocket company SpaceX could also go public this year.

Like many other companies, Databricks is generating revenue from AI. The company helps its clients connect their data with AI models to launch custom agents, in addition to providing tools for storing, processing and querying data. AI products now generate $1.4 billion in annualized revenue, Databricks said in a statement. The pace of Databricks' overall expansion is accelerating — in June, the company forecast 50% growth.

The company said in December that it was raising more than $4 billion in the round at a valuation of $134 billion. 

""We weren't sure we're going to actually be able to raise all of the five,"" said Ghodsi, adding that there was heavy interest in recent weeks. He said it can take months for venture capital to reflect major changes in equity markets. 

Goldman Sachs, Glade Brook Capital, Morgan Stanley, Neuberger Berman and the Qatar Investment Authority are among the investors in the new round. JPMorgan led the debt round, and now Databricks has billions in cash on hand.

""If this correction hasn't bottomed out yet, and it's just going to continue, we're just going to continue as a private company,"" Ghodsi said.

Databricks is now larger than rival Snowflake, which reported $1.21 billion in revenue in the October quarter. Snowflake's market cap stands at about $58 billion. With the wide release of its Lakebase database last week, Databricks has expanded its market, challenging incumbents such as Oracle and SAP.

Oracle and Snowflake shares both fell about 13% last week as software stocks took a step down across the market. That happened due to investors worrying that open-source plugins for Anthropic's Claude Cowork AI-powered productivity tool might pose new competitive challenges for public software companies. 

""The correction is an overreaction, and you're going to see all these companies be around, and nobody's getting rid of them anytime soon,"" Ghodsi said. ""Their moat is shrinking.""

Founded in 2013, Databricks ranked No. 3 on CNBC's 2025 Disruptor 50 list.

As OpenAI faces intensifying pressure from rival Anthropic's improved coding tools, CEO Sam Altman is telling employees and investors that his company is seeing its share of momentum.

Altman told OpenAI employees on Friday that ChatGPT, the company's popular artificial intelligence chatbot, is ""back to exceeding 10% monthly growth,"" according to an internal Slack message viewed by CNBC. OpenAI is also preparing to launch ""an updated Chat model"" this week, Altman said.

More than 800 million people use ChatGPT each week, but Google and Anthropic have been gaining ground. OpenAI declared a ""code red"" in December to improve ChatGPT, and temporarily sidelined several projects to focus on that effort. 

In his message on Friday, Altman said OpenAI's coding product, Codex, grew about 50% from a week ago. Codex competes directly with Anthropic's Claude Code, which has seen a wave of adoption over the last year.

OpenAI launched a new Codex model, GPT‑5.3-Codex, last week, as well as a stand-alone app for users with Apple computers. Altman said Codex's growth is ""insane,"" according to the internal message. 

""This was a great week,"" Altman wrote.

It was also a contentious week. 

Altman and other senior executives took to social media to respond to swipes from Anthropic, which ran Super Bowl ads that poked fun at OpenAI's decision to run ads within ChatGPT. In a post on X, Altman said that the commercials were ""deceptive"" and that OpenAI would ""obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them."" 

On Monday, OpenAI will officially begin testing ads within ChatGPT, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named due to confidentiality. Last month the company said the ads will be clearly labeled, appear at the bottom of the chatbot's answers and will not influence ChatGPT's responses.

OpenAI expects ads to make up less than half of its revenue long term, the person said. The digital ad market has long been dominated by Google and Meta, with Amazon becoming a bigger player in recent years. 

Altman and CFO Sarah Friar have been selling investors on OpenAI's growth story as the company looks to wrap up what could be a $100 billion fundraising round, sources told CNBC. 

In private meetings, the executives are highlighting OpenAI's strength with consumers, growing enterprise business and access to compute, according one person, who asked not to be named because the talks are private.

OpenAI has been circulating charts as part of the discussions. One chart shows that Codex, based on internal data, is eating into Claude Code's market share, according to a screenshot seen by CNBC. 

OpenAI expects fundraising talks to heat up over the next two weeks, one person said. OpenAI closed a $41 billion round in March than included a $30 billion contribution from SoftBank and $11 billion from other investors.

The current funding round could close in two parts, as CNBC previously reported. The first would include capital from Microsoft and Nvidia as well as Amazon, which is in talks to invest up to $50 billion in the company. Other contributions from participants like SoftBank, which has discussed putting in another $30 billion, would follow.

The details of the round are fluid and could still change.

In this article

Novo Nordisk on Monday said it is suing online telehealth provider Hims & Hers for mass marketing cheaper, unapproved copies of the drugmaker's new Wegovy obesity pill and injections in the U.S. 

Novo is asking the court to permanently ban Hims from selling compounded versions of its drugs that infringe on the company's patents and is seeking to recover damages.

""This is a complete sham, and it has been a sham since the shortage ended,"" said John Kuckelman, Novo's group general counsel of global legal, intellectual property and security, in an interview. 

""The fact is that their medicines are untested, and they're putting patients at risk,"" he added, referring to how the safety, efficacy and quality of compounded medicines are not verified by U.S. regulators. 

The move escalates the feud between Novo and Hims, which said on Saturday it will stop offering its new copycat obesity pill after facing scrutiny from federal regulators and legal threats from the Danish drugmaker. Hims had planned to offer the oral drug for as little as $49 for the first month, roughly $100 less than Novo's approved Wegovy pill. 

In a statement on Monday, Hims said the lawsuit is ""a blatant attack by a Danish company on millions of Americans who rely on compounded medications for access to personalized care"" and is another case of Big Pharma ""weaponizing the US judicial system to limit consumer choice.""Hims added it has a ""long history of providing safe access to personalized healthcare"" to patients.

Novo Nordisk's Copenhagen-listed shares climbed more than 3% on Monday, while Hims' NYSE-listed stock fell more than 27%. 

The lawsuit comes as Novo works to reclaim market share in the booming obesity drug market and fend off competition from both Eli Lilly and a wave of compounded alternatives. Those copycats have proliferated under a regulatory loophole that allows companies like Hims to sell compounded versions of patent-protected drugs when branded treatments are in short supply.

Semaglutide — the active ingredient in Novo's pill and its blockbuster injections — is no longer in shortage in the U.S., thanks to the company's efforts to ramp up manufacturing capacity. There are no shortages reported for the Wegovy pill, which has had an explosive launch since it entered the U.S. market in early January. 

Even so, Novo estimated in January that as many as 1.5 million Americans are using compounded GLP-1 drugs.

Hims has said its compounded pill and other GLP-1 products contain semaglutide, despite the ingredient being protected by U.S. patents through 2032. Hims has said its versions are legal because they are ""personalized"" in dosage.

But Novo said it does not directly or indirectly sell semaglutide for copycats, and accused Hims of engaging in illegal mass compounding. 

""I would just say we do want an end to mass compounding, to unlawful mass compounding,"" Kuckelman said, noting that Novo is not trying to stop all compounding practices.  

He said compounding has to be based on legitimate grounds, ""as opposed to you producing mass stocks of what you're calling a personalized medicine, which is really just a dosage variation."" 

Compounded drugs can be produced on a case-by-case basis when a doctor determines it is medically necessary for a patient, such as when they can't swallow a pill or are allergic to a specific ingredient in a branded drug. 

On Friday, the Food and Drug Administration announced it planned to take legal action against Hims for the pill, including restricting access to the ingredients and referring the company to the Department of Justice over potential violations.

Kuckelman said some telehealth platforms, such as Ro, ""are doing the right things"" by transitioning to providing patients with real FDA-approved products from Novo and its competitors. 

But ""some won't, and the only way it appears that we're going to get Hims and others to stop this is through hopefully government enforcement actions and through lawsuits like the one that we've filed today,"" he said. 

Novo and Lilly have aggressively cracked down on compounding pharmacies over the past two years as they benefit from the soaring popularity of their weight loss and diabetes drugs. Novo has so far filed around 130 lawsuits dealing with deceptive marketing practices and consumer fraud, Kuckelman said. 

Lilly has gone through a similar legal process with tirzepatide, the active ingredient in its weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro, which is no longer in short supply in the U.S.

In this article

Big Tech stocks were a mixed bag on Monday, after a bruising week that saw more than $1 trillion wiped from their market caps.

Oracle climbed 9% and Microsoft had edged about 2% higher. Nvidia gained about 3%. Meta was largely flat while Alphabet lost about 1%. Amazon shares sank about 2%.

Oracle got a boost from D.A. Davidson's upgrade on the stock.

The market grew jittery after expenditure outlooks continued to shoot through the roof in Big Tech earnings last week, as companies doubled down on AI bets.

Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta reported a combined capital expenditure of about $120 billion in the fourth quarter alone. The figure could approach $700 billion in 2026, higher than the gross domestic product of countries like the United Arab Emirates, Singapore and Israel.

Jim Reid, head of global macro research at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a Monday note that last week was the worst for the ""Magnificent 7"" stocks since April, when U.S. tariffs plunged markets into crisis and the stocks fell 4.66%. 

Signs of recovery were on show as the markets closed last week, with Magnificent 7 stocks rising 0.45% on Friday, despite Amazon falling 5.55%, Reid said.

Cloud companies' growing margins come alongside ""potential stock volatility"" amid macro headwinds, said Justin Post, a research analyst at Bank of America Securities, in a note on Monday. 

""But management teams seem confident in their ability to forecast demand and that capacity will be fully utilized in 2026,"" he added.

The markets reacted negatively to Amazon and Alphabet's capex guidance being ""well above"" consensus expectations, said David Lefkowitz, CIO head of US equities at UBS Financial Services on Friday, adding this ""overshadowed stronger-than-expected cloud growth for both companies.""

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC's ""Halftime Report"" on Friday that the tech industry's surging capital expenditures for AI infrastructure were justified, given the ""sky high"" demand for computing power.

Analysts predict room to grow for hyperscaler capex.

""As monthly tokens processed grows exponentially, aggregate cloud revenue for GCP/AWS/Azure accelerates, data center commitments expand, and data center component suppliers highlight accelerating demand, we believe there will continue to be upward pressure on hyperscaler capex estimates,"" Morgan Stanley said in a note on Monday morning.

Gold prices rose on Monday, buoyed by a softer dollar as investors braced for a week packed with U.S. economic data that could offer more clues on the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy.

Spot gold rose 2.1% to $5,063.88 per ounce by 11:12 a.m. ET, extending a 4% rally from Friday.

U.S. gold futures for April delivery also gained 2.2% to $5,087.10 per ounce.

The U.S. dollar fell 0.8% to a more than one-week low, making greenback-priced bullion cheaper for overseas buyers.

""The big mover today (in gold prices) is the U.S. dollar,"" said Bart Melek, global head of commodity strategy at TD Securities, adding that expectations are growing for weak economic data, particularly on the labor front.

Investors are closely watching this week's release of U.S. nonfarm payrolls, consumer prices and initial jobless claims for fresh signals on monetary policy, with markets already pricing in at least two rate cuts of 25 basis points in 2026. 

U.S. nonfarm payrolls are expected to have risen by 70,000 in January, according to a Reuters poll.

Lower interest rates tend to support gold by reducing the opportunity cost of holding the non-yielding asset.

China's central bank extended its gold-buying spree for a 15th month in January, data from the People's Bank of China showed on Saturday.

""The debasement trade continues, with ongoing geopolitical risks driving people into gold,"" Melek said, adding that China's purchases have had a psychological impact on the market.

Spot silver climbed 5.8% to $82.49 per ounce after a near 10% gain in the previous session. It hit an all-time high of $121.64 on January 29.

Spot platinum was up 1.2% at $2,120.62 per ounce, while palladium gained 1.7% to $1,734.72.

Platinum and palladium are widely used in catalytic converters for internal combustion vehicles and there are expectations that electric vehicles would curb demand for the metals, which had a bullish run in 2025.

""A slowdown in EV sales hasn't really materialized despite all the policy softening, so I do see that platinum and palladium will possibly slow down,"" WisdomTree commodities strategist Nitesh Shah said.

At America's oldest bank, 134 new workers don't sleep or take sick days. They don't even have names.

They're what BNY calls ""digital employees."" They work side by side with humans. They have unique roles and are evaluated by how well they do them. Some of their jobs were done by people last year.

""The digital employee works 24/7, which is obviously very different to our human counterparts,"" said Rachel Lewis, who oversees nine digital employees in addition to thousands of humans as head of payment operations for BNY.  ""It's really focused on very specific repetitive tasks that allow our human employees to do much more human, intense, interesting-type roles.""

BNY employs 48,100 humans, down from about 53,400 in 2023, according to a recent earnings presentation. CFO Dermot McDonogh was asked on the firm's fourth-quarter analyst call last month what the 134 digital employees mean for cost savings at the firm. 

""Our head count has trended down a little bit, but that's not really anything to do with AI yet,"" McDonogh said. ""We talk about, internally, AI is unlocking capacity. We don't think about it in the narrow definition of efficiency. It's all about growing with clients, increasing revenues and optimizing the potential for our employees."" 

Across Wall Street, analysts and investors are starting to ask more questions about how the industry's expenses on AI will translate into higher efficiencies and greater returns. BNY spent $3.8 billion on technology in 2025, or about 19% of its revenue. That's the highest proportion among its large-bank peers, according to data collated by CNBC.

""There's an AI arms race. The banks are part of that, said Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo. ""But you don't define success by who spends the most. You define success by who has the best results.""

""It's a lot of 'spraying and praying' when it comes to spending on tech, generally,"" he said. 

However, BNY has been identified as one of the companies that could see the biggest benefits from AI. Goldman Sachs' research team screened the Russell 1000 for potential productivity improvements, based on labor costs and wage exposure to AI automation. The firm ranked BNY toward the top of that list, saying the bank could see a potential 19% boost to earnings per share. 

But in several conversations CNBC had with executives at BNY, they've been steadfast that the multitude of technology investments won't come at the expense of human employees.

""I wouldn't think about it that way,"" said Michelle O'Reilly, BNY global head of talent. ""I would think about it more as unlocking that productivity – enabling all employees to be productive.""

While the company is building more digital employees, it's also upskilling the human ones. Shortly after ChatGPT was released in late 2022, BNY set up its AI Hub. 

""That's when we really doubled down and realized that this would be transformational for the bank,"" said Leigh-Ann Russell, BNY's chief information officer and global head of engineering. ""Our biggest focus initially was enablement – getting some training rolled out to every one of our employees at the bank.""

BNY built a platform it calls Eliza, which pulls in a variety of open-source, commercially available models that are integrated with the firm's internal data and compliance. Almost all of BNY's workforce has completed a 10-hour training for Eliza, and thousands more have taken it a step further through a multi-day AI bootcamp that can help non-engineers find creative ways to automate parts of their jobs. 

The name ""Eliza"" is a tribute to Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton, the wife of the bank's founder and America's first Treasury Secretary, Alexander Hamilton. 

""Democratization of this technology is one of our sweet spots on how we feel like we've been successful so far,"" Russell said. ""I have this juxtaposition of this original history of this amazing 241-year institution and being at the forefront of AI, and I think that's just a lovely reminder of technology over the centuries.""

The Cuban government said international airlines can no longer refuel there due to fuel shortages after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened tariffs on any country that supplies the communist country with oil.

The island nation's leadership said Sunday that Cuba will run out of aviation fuel from Monday, likely disrupting airlines operating there, according to EFE news agency, citing two sources. The kerosene shortage is expected to persist for the next month, with all of Cuba's international airports affected.

Cuba's Foreign Ministry and the Cuban Embassy in London did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.

The Trump administration has sought to tighten the U.S. chokehold on Cuba since Jan. 3, when it conducted an audacious military operation to depose Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a longtime ally of Cuba's government.

Trump, in an executive order issued at the end of January, said the Cuban government constituted ""an unusual and extraordinary threat,"" which required a national emergency declaration. 

The U.S. president said Cuba's ties to countries including China, Russia and Iran, human rights violations, and communist leadership destabilize the region ""through migration and violence."" 

As part of the announcement, Trump said U.S. tariffs may target countries that provides any oil to Cuba, whether directly or indirectly. 

Gripped by a deepening energy crisis, Cuba on Friday outlined extensive measures designed to protect essential services and ration fuel supplies for key sectors.

The plan reportedly includes restrictions on fuel sales, the closure of some tourist establishments, shortening school days, and a reduction of the working week at state-owned companies to four days, from Monday to Thursday.

Russia, which holds friendly ties with Cuba, said Monday that Havana's fuel situation was ""truly critical"" and that U.S. attempts to further pressure the country were causing numerous problems.

""The situation in Cuba is truly critical. We know this. We are in intensive contact with our Cuban friends through diplomatic and other channels. Indeed, let's say the U.S.'s stranglehold is causing many difficulties for the country,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday, according to state news outlet RIA Novosti.

Cuba's foreign minister, Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, previously said the country's leadership condemned Washington's tariff threats in the ""strongest possible terms.""

In a statement posted on Jan. 30, Parrilla also accused the U.S. government of resorting to ""blackmail and coercion in an attempt to make other countries to join its universally condemned blockade policy against Cuba.""

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said last week that her government would aim to send humanitarian aid to Cuba from Monday, adding that the country is working to find a diplomatic solution to resume oil shipments to the Caribbean island.

Mexico had paused shipments of crude and refined products to Cuba amid pressure from the Trump administration.

In this article

Monday.com's stock plummeted more than 21% on Monday after the project management platform issued weak guidance as it grapples with rising concerns that artificial intelligence is disrupting the software business model.

The Israel-based company called for revenue between $338 million and $340 million in the current quarter, short of the $343 million expected by analysts polled by FactSet. For the full year, Monday.com forecasted between $1.452 billion and $1.462 billion in revenue, versus a FactSet estimate of $1.48 billion.

Software stocks have sold off in recent weeks on rising AI disruption fears and worries that new agentic tools can replace them. 

So far this year, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) has plummeted 22%, while shares of Monday.com have already lost half their value.

During an earnings call with analysts, management defended the company's market position and highlighted new AI capabilities being implemented, such as agents and a vibe feature, to improve conversion and engagement.

""We don't see any impact currently from any AI company, and we're shifting our product, regardless, to be more AI native,"" said co-CEO and co-founder Eran Zinman. 

He said the company has pivoted messaging around ads and on its homepage to become more AI focused. 

However, management said it expects ongoing choppiness in the market this year due to near-term margin pressure from foreign exchange rates.

The software company reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.04 per share, excluding items, beating the 92 cents per share LSEG expectation. Revenue grew 25% from a year ago to $333.9 million, above the $329.6 million expected by analysts.

Monday.com forecasted operating income of $165 million to $175 million for the year, versus a FactSet estimate of $220.2 million.

Oops, something went wrong

(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin slipped below $70,000 on Monday following a roller-coaster ride at the end of last week.

The original cryptocurrency — which had stabilized during the Asia day — fell around 2% to $69,037 at around 7:20 a.m. in New York. The move was still relatively tame compared with last week's wild swings, when Bitcoin on Thursday plunged to $60,033, its lowest since October 2024, before rallying back above $70,000 on Friday.

Traders remain on edge.

“While cryptocurrency prices have managed to bounce from last week's lows, there still seems no rush to pick up coins on the cheap,” said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at investing and trading platform IG. He added that “cryptocurrencies need bullish momentum, and despite the recovery last week that is still lacking.”

Last week's selloff saw Bitcoin volatility surge. The Bitcoin Volmex Implied Volatility Index jumped above 97% in the largest intraday increase since the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX in 2022.

Extreme volatility is nothing new to cryptocurrencies, but Bitcoin's slump from a peak of $126,000 in October last year comes despite the backdrop of a crypto-friendly White House and surging institutional adoption. Its failure to act as a safe haven during a period of heightened geopolitical uncertainty has raised doubts that it functions as a kind of “digital gold.”

Still, in a tentative sign of returning optimism, US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds recorded inflows of $221 million on Feb. 6 as investors sought to buy the dip following the market's dizzying selloff.

“We expect to see decreased liquidity and nervous markets yielding larger moves in the short term,” said Jeff Anderson, head of Asia at STS Digital. “A dip back below $70,000 is less significant as we wait for the next sustained move either below $62,000 or a break above $76,000.”

February 8, 2026 / 11:03 PM CST
            / CBS Chicago
          

Patricia Martin, a lawyer turned judge who spent 24 years on the bench, rising to become the top judge in Cook County's Juvenile Court, seemed to have the credentials to be trusted handling the finances of Oscar Lawton Wilkerson as he reached his mid-90s. 

She had been related to the former Tuskegee Airman and agreed to help. Instead of helping Wilkerson, court records show Martin instead helped herself to his cash, moving money from his accounts and buying bitcoin.

Eric Puryear has known Wilkerson his entire life, as his grandfather was Wilkerson's best friend. They trusted Martin to manage the money, considering her an adopted family member.

""Every box for trustworthiness seemed to be checked there, and so she seemed to be the perfect person,"" said Puryear. ""She seemed like the perfect person on paper. In hindsight, she was not.""

The first sign of trouble came in August 2020, when the nursing home where Wilkerson was living called to say they had not been paid in months, and $41,000 was owed immediately. Puryear started looking into what happened with Wilkerson's finances.

""Account balances weren't right, checks were being dishonored,"" said Puryear. ""Serious financial problem.""

This didn't make sense to Puryear. Wilkerson had saved plenty and now was facing a new battle after all he sacrificed. 

""He's a Tuskegee Airmen, World War II veteran, just an all-around wonderful person,"" said Puryear. ""Dealing with segregation, dealing with all of that while still also flying, it is amazing.""

Wilkerson made history as one of America's first Black military pilots. Tuskegee Airmen took frontline risks and then took heat as boundary breakers that many didn't like. After the military, Wilkerson flew for fun and became a Chicago-based radio technician. He married, never had kids, and saved for his golden years.

""It was clear Lawton should have had hundreds of thousands of dollars, certainly enough to take care of him for the rest of his life, because he'd worked so hard and saved so hard,"" said Puryear.

Puryear reached out to Martin about the missing funds, but wasn't getting an answer from her.

""She attempted to dodge and evade, like apparently she'd been doing for some number of months at that point, and she didn't seem to have the time to return a phone call over such an important thing,"" said Puryear. ""You'd think, if she was innocent, that would have caused her to want to communicate right away, but she didn't.""  

It was a critical time for Wilkerson since, without paying what he owed the nursing home, he was told he was going to have to move out of the place he called home if things weren't settled.

""She stole the money, we can see from some of the documents we've gotten,"" said Puryear. ""All of her actions, they shock the conscience.""  

Court documents show 11 withdrawals over 18 months, with Martin shutting down accounts and pocketing more than $245,000, moving most of her new wealth into hard-to-track bitcoin. She was arrested and faced various charges, including money laundering and financial exploitation of an elderly person. She pleaded guilty to one felony theft count and was sentenced to four years of probation.

""Probation and a felony conviction for that sort of theft from that sort of a victim just is not quite enough,"" said Puryear. ""It's hard to think of something more evil for her to have done, but she did.""

Puryear, an attorney, filed a lawsuit on Wilkerson's behalf to get his money back, accusing Martin of stealing more than $380,000. During that case, Martin repeatedly failed to show up for court hearings. The judge ordered her to halt all transactions, but court documents show she ignored that, too, and moved more money. In the end, the judge ordered Martin to pay up nearly $1.2 million in damages – triple the amount she stole.

""It makes me wonder what is wrong in Patricia's heart that she would do that to somebody,"" said Puryear. 

Martin appealed the lawsuit judgment and had it overturned, in part because Wilkerson died. Wilkerson's loved ones are planning to file another lawsuit, continuing their fight to get back the money Martin took.

She lost her law license because of all this, admitting: ""… the evidence would clearly and convincingly establish the facts and conclusions of misconduct.""

Wilkerson's care never suffered due to Martin's theft, but for a man whose legacy is etched in history, the moves of Martin are etched in the minds of those who loved him most.

""Lawton was such a fine man; one of the finest people I have ever met in my life,"" said Puryear. ""And Patricia Martin is one of the absolute worst humans, and to see that contrast between them is breathtaking.""

Martin declined to speak with CBS News Chicago for this story. The former judge continues to draw her government pension.

MegaETH, a high-performance blockchain built to make Ethereum applications feel nearly instant, debuted its public mainnet Monday, entering an ecosystem mired in a fundamental debate over how Ethereum should scale.

The project, which had pitched itself as a layer-2 “real-time blockchain” targeting more than 100,000 transactions per second (tps), would make onchain interactions feel closer to traditional web apps than today's crypto networks. Ethereum works at less than 30 tps, according to Token Terminal.

The release caps a rapid rise that has drawn both technical curiosity and major financial backing. The project's development arm, MegaLabs, raised a $20 million seed round in 2024 led by Dragonfly. Last October, it announced a $450 million oversubscribed token sale backed by some of the most recognizable names in crypto, including Ethereum co-founders Vitalik Buterin and Joe Lubin. The sale was one of the largest crypto fundraises of that year.

The native token, MEGA, which underpins the network's economics, is not fully unlocked at launch. According to the team, token distribution and utility will roll out gradually, with certain unlocks tied to network usage milestones.

MegaETH's debut comes as Ethereum's long-standing scaling roadmap is being examined, particularly by Buterin. For years, the second-largest blockchain by market cap relied on layer-2 networks, offchain systems that batch transactions and settle them back on the base layer, to handle most of the ecosystem's growth. 

But in recent discussions, Buterin has suggested that Ethereum may need to invest more heavily in scaling the layer-1 network to reduce fragmentation and simplify the user experience.

Those comments have ignited debate across the ecosystem. Supporters of layer 2s argue that the so-called rollups remain essential and already deliver meaningful performance gains. Critics say an overreliance on them has scattered liquidity and users across dozens of networks. MegaETH's high-speed, low-latency design lands squarely in the middle of that argument, betting that there is still strong demand for chains that push performance far beyond current norms.

The cryptocurrency industry went under intense pressure last week, with Bitcoin and Ethereum leading the crash and multiple cryptocurrencies hitting new multi-month lows. The crash was more pronounced with Bitcoin, though, and the imbalance in selling pressure is quietly shifting the relationship between the two assets. 

The interesting imbalance is relayed in Ethereum's performance relative to Bitcoin. A technical analysis of the ETH/BTC ratio shared on the social media platform X by Jonathan Carter indicates that Ethereum may be approaching a critical breakout point against Bitcoin, following an extended period of compression on the 2-week candlestick timeframe chart.

Long-Term Triangle On The Verge Of Break

According to technical analysis of the ETH/BTC 2-week chart, Ethereum is nearing an important point against Bitcoin after years of consolidation beneath a descending trendline. This long-running pattern originates from a major peak in relative valuation in July 2017, when 1 ETH was worth 0.154 BTC in Bitcoin terms, and has since formed a series of lower highs to form a falling resistance trendline. The lower boundary of this pattern is a long-tested support zone around 0.02 that has repeatedly drawn buying interest for Ethereum in relation to Bitcoin.

At the time of writing, the ETH/BTC ratio is trading around 0.030. However, the most recent 2-week candlestick has flipped green, and this development is important to the bullish outlook of Ethereum's performance against Bitcoin.

The bullish projection is based on a full playout of the green candlestick with a push towards the descending triangle's resistance trendline. If the pair can convincingly break above the descending triangle's upper trend boundary with sustained momentum, then this would allow Ethereum to enter a phase of sustained outperformance against Bitcoin.

How High Could ETH/BTC Go If A Breakout Happens?

Crypto analyst Jonathan Carter outlined a series of potential upside targets should the ETH/BTC pair break free from its downward trend. The first target is around 0.040 BTC, which would represent a clear departure from the compressed range seen across recent months. If momentum continues, higher potential objectives include 0.060, 0.085, 0.105, 0.124, and all the way up to the 2017 peak of 0.154.

Translating these ratio-based targets into absolute price levels is less straightforward, as the projections are based on Ethereum's performance relative to Bitcoin and not standalone price moves. Such a performance can happen in two major ways: either Ethereum receives more inflows than Bitcoin, or Bitcoin could crash more than Ethereum during a market-wide correction.

The former scenario would most likely translate into a sustained rotation into Ethereum and the wider altcoin market, setting the stage for an altcoin season. Nonetheless, both scenarios will see the otherwise strong Bitcoin dominance dropping massively.

Ethereum is leading the development of a new set of standards for the use of AI in crypto.

Ethereum (ETH +1.76%) might be on the verge of making major inroads into being a provider of artificial intelligence (AI) agent infrastructure in crypto. If it succeeds, it would likely see a lot more demand for its coin, and a lot more automated activity on its chain, both of which would boost its price.

But what exactly is in the works here, and does it actually count as a reason to buy the coin as aggressively as some of the evangelists are saying?

Image source: Getty Images.

In the tech world, if an organization can define certain coding practices as the standard for implementing a feature on one of its platforms, it's effectively able to shape the entire ecosystem. Aside from training developers to work on your platform, thereby expanding your talent pool, setting a standard is a prime way to demonstrate technical leadership and build prestige. And that's exactly what Ethereum is angling to do with its new ERC-8004 standard, which is intended to guide the development of AI agents that operate on its chain and others.

Technically speaking, ERC-8004 is a draft Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC) that defines three new data registries for AI agents: one for identity, one for reputation, and one for validation. It also specifies an off-chain file where an agent can report its metadata, as well as a way for third parties to submit feedback that smart contracts can then read. 

Basically, ERC-8004 is a new standard that defines an ID system and review framework for AI agents. That framework calls for gathering data on each AI agent's name, skills, and track record for completing its assigned tasks. The strategic vision here is that once AI agents can discover each other on the blockchain and prove their identity and competence to each other, it will open the door to a flourishing market for AI services that settle in Ethereum.

If ERC-8004 becomes widely adopted, it could bring a lot more traffic to Ethereum, as it will be the network with the clearest framework for AI agents to operate within. More sustained traffic can translate into more transaction fees burned, which can support Ethereum's price, as agents will need to be supplied with Ether (or work to generate it themselves) before they can perform any independent tasks.

But there are two caveats that may mean the rollout of this new standard isn't a slam dunk for holders. First, developers abiding by the practices described in an ERC is optional. Adoption of a new set of standards can take a long time.

Second, Ethereum keeps pushing down its gas fees with each successive upgrade it performs. So Ethereum can get tons more usage while generating lower fees and thus constraining the returns for holders. 

So the new ERC-8004 standard is promising, but it's not exactly a reason to run and buy Ethereum hand over fist. Wait for people to actually start using the standard in a way that demonstrably generates more demand for the coin before getting more aggressive with your purchasing.

Bitmine has 2,873,459 staked ETH, representing $6.2 billion at $2,125 per ETH; MAVAN staking solution on track to launch Q1 2026

Bitmine now owns 3.58% of the ETH token supply, over 72% of the way to the 'Alchemy of 5%' in just 6 months

Bitmine recently closed on initial $200 million investment into Beast Industries

Bitmine Crypto + Total Cash Holdings + ""Moonshots"" total $10.0 billion, including 4.326 million ETH tokens, total cash of $595 million, and other crypto holdings

Bitmine leads crypto treasury peers by both the velocity of raising crypto NAV per share and by the high trading liquidity of BMNR stock

Bitmine is the 107th most traded stock in the US, trading $1.3 billion per day (5-day avg)

Bitmine remains supported by a premier group of institutional investors including ARK's Cathie Wood, MOZAYYX, Founders Fund, Bill Miller III, Pantera, Kraken, DCG, Galaxy Digital and personal investor Thomas ""Tom"" Lee to support Bitmine's goal of acquiring 5% of ETH

LAS VEGAS, Feb. 9, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- (NYSE AMERICAN: BMNR) Bitmine Immersion Technologies, Inc. (""Bitmine"" or the ""Company"") a Bitcoin and Ethereum Network company with a focus on the accumulation of crypto for long term investment, today announced Bitmine crypto + total cash + ""moonshots"" holdings totaling $10.0 billion.

As of February 8th, 2026 at 3:00pm ET, the Company's crypto holdings are comprised of 4,325,738 ETH at $2,125 per ETH (NASDAQ: COIN), 193 Bitcoin (BTC), $200 million stake in Beast Industries, $19 million stake in Eightco Holdings (NASDAQ: ORBS) (""moonshots"") and total cash of $595 million. Bitmine's ETH holdings are 3.58% of the ETH supply (of 120.7 million ETH).

""ETH prices declined -62% from 2025 highs, while Ethereum daily transactions hit an all-time high (ATH) of 2.5mm (per theblock.co) and active addresses soared in 2026 to an ATH of 1 million daily (per theblock.co),"" said Thomas ""Tom"" Lee, Executive Chairman of Bitmine. Crypto prices are highly volatile, and in fact, this is the 8th time since 2018 that ETH prices have fallen 50% or more from a recent high, meaning declines like this are seen annually. In 2025, from January to March, ETH prices fell -64% and yet still surged from $1,600 to $5,000 later in the year.""

""ETH sees V-shaped recoveries from major lows. This happened in each of the 8 prior declines of 50% or more. A similar recovery is expected in 2026. The best investment opportunities in crypto have presented themselves after declines. Think back to 2025, the single best entry points in crypto occurred after markets fell sharply due to tariff concerns,"" said Lee.

""In the past week, we acquired 40,613 ETH,"" continued Lee. ""Bitmine has been steadily buying Ethereum, as we view this pullback as attractive, given the strengthening fundamentals. In our view, the price of ETH is not reflective of the high utility of ETH and its role as the future of finance.""

As of February 8, 2026, Bitmine total staked ETH stands at 2,897,459 ($6.2 billion at $2,125 per ETH). ""Bitmine has staked more ETH than other entities in the world. At scale (when Bitmine's ETH is fully staked by MAVAN and its staking partners), the ETH staking rewards is $374 million annually (using 3.115% CESR), or greater than $1 million per day,"" stated Lee.

""Annualized staking revenues are now $202 million, up +7% in the past week (see chart). And this 2.9 million ETH is about 67% of the 4.3 million ETH held by Bitmine. The CESR (Composite Ethereum Staking Rate, administered by Quatrefoil) is 3.11%. Bitmine's own staking operations generated a 7-day yield of 3.3234% (annualized). We continue to make progress on our staking solution known as The Made in America VAlidator Network (MAVAN). This will be the 'best-in-class' solution offering secure staking infrastructure and will be deployed in early calendar 2026. Bitmine is currently working with 3 staking providers as the Company moves towards unveiling MAVAN in 2026,"" continued Lee.

Bitmine crypto holding reigns as the #1 Ethereum treasury and #2 global treasury, behind Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR), which owns 713,502 BTC valued at $51 billion. Bitmine remains the largest ETH treasury in the world. 

Bitmine is one of the most widely traded stocks in the US. According to data from Fundstrat, the stock has traded average daily dollar volume of $1.3 billion (5-day average, as of February 6, 2026), ranking #107 in the US, behind Arista Networks (rank #106) and ahead of Monolithic Power Systems (rank #108) among 5,704 US-listed stocks (statista.com and Fundstrat research).

The GENIUS Act and Securities and Exchange Commission's (""the SEC"") Project Crypto are as transformational to financial services in 2025 as US action on August 15, 1971 ending Bretton Woods and the USD on the gold standard 54 years ago. This 1971 event was the catalyst for the modernization of Wall Street, creating the iconic Wall Street titans and financial and payment rails of today. These proved to be better investments than gold.

Oops, something went wrong

Crypto analyst Alex Krüger says most tokens have failed by design, arguing that outdated regulation pushes projects to launch assets stripped of enforceable rights.

His comments coincide with a period of elevated token failures in the crypto market. Since 2021, over 13.4 million tokens have ""died.""

According to CoinGecko research, 53.2% of all cryptocurrencies listed on GeckoTerminal had failed as of the end of 2025. 11.6 million tokens collapsed in 2025, representing 86.3% of all failures recorded since 2021, signaling an unprecedented acceleration.

The number of crypto projects listed rose from about 428,000 in 2021 to 20.2 million by 2025. This surge was met with escalating failures: just 2,584 dead coins in 2021, rising to 213,075 in 2022, 245,049 in 2023, and 1.38 million in 2024. Yet, 2025's collapse dwarfed all previous years.

Certain niches experienced even higher failure rates. Music and video tokens failed at rates close to 75%. Crypto analyst Krüger argued that outdated regulations and token structures fueled the crisis.

“​Most tokens ever created are worthless by design because of outdated regulations,” he wrote.

In a detailed post, Krüger argued that the SEC's use of the Howey Test and enforcement-led oversight pushed crypto projects into a corner. For context, US regulators use the Howey Test to determine whether a transaction qualifies as an “investment contract” and therefore a security under federal securities laws.

A transaction is a security if it involves:

an investment of money,

in a common enterprise,

with an expectation of profit,

based on the efforts of others.

If all four are met, US securities laws apply. To avoid being classified as securities, teams systematically stripped tokens of all rights. The result, he said, was an asset class defined by speculation rather than ownership.

This design choice had far-reaching consequences. When token holders have no contractual rights, they also have no legal recourse. At the same time, founders face no enforceable fiduciary duties toward the people funding their projects.

In practice, this created an accountability vacuum. Teams could control large treasuries with or abandon projects entirely, often without facing legal or financial consequences.

“​In any other market, a project offering zero rights and total treasury opacity wouldn't raise a dime. In crypto, it was the only compliant way to launch. ​The result is a decade of tokens designed to soft rug,” he added.

Disillusioned by VC-backed utility tokens, retail traders turned to meme coins, which offered a transparent lack of utility. As Krüger highlighted, this trend increased speculation and intense market behaviors.

“And this only made the rot worse: memecoins are even more speculative and less transparent, accelerating a shift toward predatory PVP trading and zero-sum gambling,” he remarked.

Krüger believes the solution is a new generation of tokens governed by a stronger regulatory framework.

Looking for new social casinos? With many options to choose from, I'll cover Sweep Jungle which launched in October 2025. New players can sign up to get a free no deposit bonus and choose from hundreds of casino-style games, including Megaways slots like Blockchain Megaways.

Like most sweepstakes casinos, Sweep Jungle provides first-time players with a free no deposit bonus. When you sign up via our exclusive link, you'll be eligible for up to 75,000 Gold Coins and 2 Sweepstakes Coins.

Then, you can choose from hundreds of slots. If I play slot games, I usually go for Megaways. These titles provide up to 117,649 ways to win on every spin.

As one of the new social casinos in 2026, Sweep Jungle only offers a handful of Megaways slots. I chose Blockchain Megaways from Booming Games.

When you play games at online sweepstakes casinos, you can choose to wager a free-play currency (like Gold Coins) or redeemable SC. If you're just starting out at Sweep Jungle, I recommend wagering GC by tapping the “Fun Play” button for Blockchain Megaways.

With your free no deposit bonus, you can start with 50,000 GC. Plus, you'll get an additional 25,000 GC for completing a profile and verifying your mobile number. (That will also give you free spin on the Fortune Wheel.)

Top features at Blockchain Megaways include:

Blockchain Megaways begins with a deep, booming voice to announce the game's title. Then, you'll hear some electronic dance music, which pairs well with the symbols of different crypto payments like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other currencies.

Minimum bets start at 20 GC. With the free no deposit bonus at Sweep Jungle, you'll have plenty of Gold Coins to wager at Blockchain Megaways.

When it comes to sweepstakes casino slots, I often test games by wagering at least 50 spins. That usually gives me a decent feel for how the game functions, including payouts.

Per the information (i) tab at Blockchain Megaways, the 200,704 winning ways are well above the standard Megaways mechanic of 117,649.

With six reels, cascading wins are possible to boost win potential. Trigger four or more scatters to get ten free spins with the potential to score five more. Free spins initiate an Unlimited Win Multiplier, which increases for every winning cascade - good for catching a hot streak.

Trigger a Collect symbol to claim all the value symbols on the reels in the base game, including multipliers (ranging from 1x - 50x).

Additional in-game features include randomized Mystery Symbols that act similarly to wilds, which substitute for all other symbols except scatters and value symbols.

The Minors (symbols) at Blockchain Megaways depict traditional currencies, like the USD, while the Majors are associated with crypto. Other than the base game, there are some unique features which keep gameplay exciting.

Up to 200,704 Megaways on every spin offers plenty of chances to win, in addition to wilds, free spins, cascading reels, and multipliers. However, I would've liked to seen some jackpots.

Still, Blockchain Megaways is an innotative slot with simple gameplay. Since Booming Games and Sweep Jungle don't list the game's return-to-player (RTP) average, I recommend sticking with Gold Coins for free-play vibes.

Tap the “Get Bonus” button below to sign up at Sweep Jungle. Claim your free no deposit bonus, simply for creating a new account.

Note: Sweepstakes casinos are not available in the state of Michigan.

Corning, New York, is known for its world-class glassmaking and artistic history. But now, artists, small studios, and even galleries are beginning to explore blockchain technology. They are not taking the place of real art. They are instead adding more ways for art to exist in both real life and online. Some are experimenting with NFT art, smart contracts, and even paying with cryptocurrency. Many creators are also learning how the ETH price can affect them when they sell digital artwork or convert their earnings into cash.

This is not just about technology. It is about giving artists more power, a wider audience, and new ways to reach buyers all over the world. It gives creators who might not be able to get to traditional galleries or collectors more options. It helps them tell their stories, share their work in new ways, and connect with people all over the world on a deeper level.

Corning has always celebrated craftsmanship. From molten glass to fine design, the town knows how to blend art and skill. Now, artists are testing a new kind of craft: digital creativity that lives on the blockchain.

NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are digital certificates that prove ownership. Artists can use them to sell paintings, photos, animations, or music online. Once an artwork is “minted” as an NFT, its ownership, sales history, and royalties are recorded on the blockchain for all to see.

Imagine a local artist creating a digital version of their glass sculpture. They could sell it through a blockchain-based marketplace. If that digital asset later resells, a smart contract could automatically trigger a royalty payment to the artist. No paperwork. No middleman. No delay.

A photographer could do something similar. They might mint photos of Corning's historic streets and offer both digital and physical versions. Collectors could scan a code to confirm that their print is authentic and part of a limited series.

Even craft studios could try this idea. A pottery shop might include blockchain-based certificates with its handmade bowls or vases. That would let buyers prove their piece is original, even years later.

Blockchain is not just for digital ownership. It can also help with payments. Some small studios are curious about accepting ETH as an alternative to credit cards. Why? Crypto payments can be faster and cheaper, especially for international buyers.

Here is how it could work. A studio in Corning could accept ETH for custom glass or ceramic pieces. A buyer from Europe or Japan could pay directly from their digital wallet. There would be no bank transfer delays and fewer foreign exchange fees.

Because payments are tracked on the blockchain, artists and studios would have clear records of every transaction. Some might even watch the ETH price daily to decide when to convert their earnings into traditional money.

This could help small businesses reach new audiences and do it without relying on expensive payment platforms.

Blockchain is not just helping artists make money. It is helping them dream bigger.

Local galleries are thinking about ways to combine traditional and digital art. They could host virtual shows alongside physical exhibitions. People could scan QR codes, look at NFT collections, and even buy digital art right from their phones.

A community art center could offer workshops teaching artists how to mint their work, set up a digital wallet, or track royalty payments. Students might learn how to protect their art online and build a portfolio that reaches beyond Corning.

Maybe, in the future, there could be an art walk where there are both glass sculptures and screens that show animations, digital paintings, and music that is based on blockchain technology. Each piece could come with a digital certificate that proves it is real and unique.

People who like to collect things, tourists who are interested in technology, and people who like to visit new places like these could all be interested in these kinds of projects. It might also help Corning become known for both high-tech and handmade art.

From blown glass to blockchain art, Corning has always been a place where creativity thrives. Now, artists, makers, and small studios are discovering that digital tools can help them protect, promote, and sell their work without losing the heart of craftsmanship.

Blockchain offers more than just hype. It provides transparency for buyers. Protection for creators. And new ways for small towns to connect with global audiences. While the ETH price may rise and fall, interest in digital art continues to grow.

The technology may change. But the purpose stays the same: to help people create, share, and value art in new ways.

Corning may be a small city, but big ideas are taking shape here. And as artists say, the future of creativity is not just handmade. It is also digital, connected, and powered by people who believe that art should never be limited by location.

The bank is building infrastructure to support digital asset offerings

UBS is preparing a gradual expansion into crypto trading and tokenized financial services, as the bank builds core infrastructure to support digital assets and blockchain-based products.

Chief executive Sergio Ermotti confirmed that UBS is developing systems to support crypto access for individual clients as well as tokenized deposit solutions for corporate customers.

The bank plans to prioritize infrastructure and targeted use cases before scaling its digital asset activities over a three-to-five-year timeframe.

The move represents a shift from UBS's earlier stance on cryptocurrencies. In previous years, senior executives expressed skepticism about the role of assets such as Bitcoin, questioning their function as money or a store of value.

As a result, UBS avoided direct crypto trading for an extended period and limited its digital asset efforts to internal blockchain experiments and research projects.

In recent years, however, the bank has steadily expanded its work on tokenization, focusing on applications that align more closely with traditional financial markets.

In 2022, UBS issued a $50 million tokenized note, marking one of its first live uses of blockchain technology for securities issuance. The bank has since continued to test tokenized structures across funds, settlement, and cash-equivalent products.

More recently, in November 2025, UBS executed a live tokenized fund transaction using Chainlink infrastructure, highlighting how blockchain technology can be applied to asset management processes. The bank has also explored tokenized money market funds on Ethereum, offering blockchain-based access to low-risk, short-term assets.

By positioning itself as a “fast follower”,  UBS is aiming to adopt proven models once regulatory and operational risks are better understood, while integrating digital assets into its existing banking framework.

Key Takeaways

OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant designed to automate tasks like managing emails, scheduling, and executing automated strategies for crypto day trading.

It is used for enhancing productivity through customizable plugins, local hosting, and seamless integration with digital workflows.

Running OpenClaw locally ensures privacy, but users must configure it securely to avoid risks like prompt injection attacks.

While OpenClaw complements tools like ChatGPT, it focuses on task execution and automation rather than conversational AI.

You are probably asking yourself, what is OpenClaw? Known previously as Clawdbot, OpenClaw has been making waves in the tech world for its innovative approach to AI-powered tools. With its recent rebranding and growing popularity, it's become a hot topic among tech enthusiasts and professionals alike.

In this article, we'll explore what makes OpenClaw so unique, why it's going viral, and its key features. We'll also dive into how it works, its potential uses, and the security concerns surrounding it. Keep reading to learn more about OpenClaw and discover if it's the right tool for you.



OpenClaw is an evolving project built around AI agents that can operate autonomously across different environments, instead of responding only to direct prompts. Earlier versions of the tool were known as Clawdbot, a name that gained attention for its experimental approach and rapid adoption within developer communities. On January 27, 2026, the project was officially rebranded to Moltbot, marking a deliberate shift in identity, structure, and long term direction. The current name, OpenClaw, reflects a broader push toward openness and extensibility rather than a single, narrowly defined use case.

Beyond its naming history, OpenClaw has been discussed in connection with crypto trading bots for automated strategies in online forums where users explore hands off systems that can monitor data, make decisions, and execute actions without constant oversight. This association has amplified both interest and concern, since tools designed for automation at this level raise questions about control, transparency, and unintended behavior. This background helps explain why OpenClaw continues to attract attention from both curious users and cautious security researchers.

OpenClaw has captured the attention of tech enthusiasts and professionals alike, quickly becoming a trending topic in the AI community. Practical use cases, strong community momentum, and growing interest in autonomous agent tools drive its popularity. Below are the main reasons behind its rapid rise.

 Unlike many traditional AI tools, OpenClaw functions as a personal ai assistant that goes beyond answering questions. It can carry out tasks such as managing emails, organizing calendars, and automating workflows. This hands-on approach makes it useful in everyday work rather than just informational.

OpenClaw's support for automated strategies for crypto day trading has drawn strong interest from traders. Tracking market signals and executing actions automatically, users can save time while maintaining consistent trading activity.

As an open-source platform, OpenClaw gives users full visibility and control. Developers can customize features, extend functionality, and adapt the tool to specific needs, which has accelerated adoption across technical communities.

 A fast-growing community has played a major role in OpenClaw's visibility. Active discussions on platforms like GitHub, Discord, and Reddit have led to shared workflows, experiments, and real world tasks that keep interest high.

The option to run OpenClaw locally appeals to privacy-conscious users. Keeping data on personal devices reduces reliance on third parties and helps address concerns around data security and access.

OpenClaw operates as a highly versatile AI agent internet designed to perform tasks autonomously while keeping users in control. Users typically start by connecting a crypto wallet, allowing Clawdbot to execute predefined actions such as managing transactions or automating trading strategies. This integration ensures that users can streamline their workflows without compromising on oversight or security implications.

The system leverages advanced natural language processing to interpret user commands and execute them across various platforms. Whether it's managing emails, scheduling meetings, or even coding, OpenClaw adapts to the user's needs. However, the agent interactions with external systems also introduces risks, such as prompt injection attacks, where malicious inputs could manipulate the AI systems into performing unintended actions. This highlights the importance of configuring permissions carefully to safeguard sensitive data.

To enhance its functionality, OpenClaw supports customization through plugins and extensions. These tools allow human users to expand its capabilities, from automating repetitive tasks to executing complex workflows. While this flexibility is a major advantage, it also requires users to remain vigilant about the security of third-party integrations. Proper setup and regular monitoring are essential to ensure that OpenClaw remains a powerful yet secure personal AI assistant.



OpenClaw is a versatile tool designed to simplify and automate a wide range of tasks. Here's a breakdown of when you should consider using it and when it might not be the best fit:

OpenClaw's advanced capabilities as a personal AI assistant come with inherent security and privacy challenges. Its ability to execute tasks autonomously, such as smart contract-based automation for crypto transactions, requires users to grant significant permissions. This level of direct access can expose sensitive data, including financial details and personal information, if not properly secured.

The platform's reliance on plugins and extensions, while offering customization, introduces potential vulnerabilities. Malicious or poorly designed plugins could exploit OpenClaw's permissions, leading to unauthorized actions or data breaches. Additionally, the risk of prompt injection attacks remains a concern, as attackers could manipulate the AI into executing shell commands that are harmful without the user's intent.

Running OpenClaw locally provides privacy benefits, but it also shifts the responsibility of security entirely to the user. Misconfigurations or lack of safeguards can result in unintended consequences, such as unauthorized access to write files or compromised smart contract–based automation. Users must implement strict permission controls and regularly monitor the system access to mitigate these risks effectively.

ClawdBot offers a free, open-source solution for users looking to automate tasks without incurring subscription fees. To get started, users can download the software from its official GitHub repository and install it on their local devices. This setup ensures full control over the system while avoiding third-party hosting costs. For those interested in automated strategies for crypto day trading, ClawdBot's free version provides the tools needed to execute trades efficiently without additional expenses.

The platform's free access includes core functionalities such as managing emails, scheduling tasks, and integrating with messaging platforms. Users can also leverage its capabilities to automate workflows, including crypto trading strategies, by connecting their wallets and configuring predefined actions. This allows traders to streamline their operations and focus on decision-making rather than manual execution.

While ClawdBot is free to use, users should be aware of potential costs associated with advanced features. For example, integrating premium AI models or accessing certain plugins may require additional fees. However, the free version remains a powerful option for those seeking to explore its capabilities, particularly for tasks like crypto day trading and other automation needs.

OpenClaw stands out as a powerful personal AI assistant, offering automation, customization, and privacy through local hosting. Its ability to execute tasks like automated strategies for crypto day trading makes it a valuable tool for users seeking efficiency. While it provides significant benefits, users must remain vigilant about security risks and proper configuration to maximize its potential safely.

OpenClaw can manage emails, schedule tasks, automate workflows, and execute automated strategies for crypto day trading, making it a versatile personal AI assistant.

OpenClaw is used for automating repetitive tasks, managing digital workflows, and enhancing productivity through customizable plugins and integrations.

OpenClaw is safe to run locally if configured properly, as it keeps data on personal devices. Users must implement strict security measures to mitigate risks like prompt injection attacks.

OpenClaw cannot fully replace ChatGPT or AutoGPT but complements them by focusing on task execution and automation rather than conversational AI.

In this interview, Ilya Tarutov, founder of Tramplin.io, looks back on a decade in crypto and pinpoints the moment the industry shifted from building long-term value to chasing attention. He unpacks how NFTs, meme coins, and high-leverage trading reshaped user behaviour, often at retail's expense. 

Tarutov also explains why he returned to product building after years as an investor, outlines Tramplin.io's premium staking model on Solana, and shares his view on what crypto must change to rebuild trust and re-engage everyday users.

Invezz: You've been in crypto since 2015. If you had to name one turning point when the industry shifted from building value to extracting attention, what was it, and what did that shift do to everyday users?

The big shift happened around 2020–2021, with the NFT boom, followed by meme coins and perp trading on exchanges. 

Before that, most projects focused on technology and building: new protocols, trustless systems, and providing long-term utility. People genuinely believed they were changing the world.

Then the industry turned into a money-making machine for both the faster, bigger, earlier players, newcomers and small holders. 

Projects have started focusing on liquidity instead of creating value. Memes have become the primary way people get into crypto, expecting 50–100x leverage.

Back then, you could believe in a project and hold it long-term. 

Now, most people just end up becoming exit liquidity for someone quicker. 

I saw this play out cycle after cycle from 2021 to 2025, and that's exactly why I wanted to build something that gives a real chance to any user without putting their hard-earned capital at risk.

Invezz: After years of avoiding building products, what made this idea, to create Tramplin.io, impossible to ignore, and why launch now?

I kept telling myself I wouldn't go back to building my own products again. Investing has become my full-time job, and I was watching startups sort of from the outside. But this idea just kept coming back to me. 

So we built it, and during testing, we received great feedback reaffirming our belief that this product is what the market needs.

Then we realised we'd accidentally recreated the model of the UK's Premium Bonds, which is a popular product with millions of users and billions invested in it in the UK alone. 

We'd found a way to give people a meaningful chance for a reward with no risk to their capital, and crypto really didn't have anything like it. 

People are tired of constant losses, tired of feeling used. Just look at what's going on in the community right now. 

There's a huge demand for something honest and safe, but with the thrill of possibility. Our team came together around the idea and built it. That's why we're doing this now: the timing feels perfect with the disappointments the latest cycles have brought.

Invezz: What is Tramplin.io, and how does it differ from standard native staking on Solana?

Tramplin.io  is a premium staking on Solana. We take native Solana staking and add a layer that redistributes rewards in a different way.

Usually, staking provides a predictable 5–7% APY (shared proportionally), which is basically “coffee money” for small amounts.

At Tramplin.io, all the staking rewards from Solana's inflation go into pools and get randomly redistributed: every 10 minutes into a small pool and monthly into a big pool.

Users don't receive a fixed percentage, but they get a shot at a much bigger win without extra risk to their capital. Their funds stay in their account; we never touch them. There's no custody, no leverage, no DeFi risks.

Invezz: You describe the model as “premium staking.” What does “premium” actually mean in this context, especially for someone staking a small amount?

Premium staking means we add an extra layer on top of standard native staking. This layer introduces an additional opportunity, but it does not work as a VIP service. 

Users still delegate SOL via regular staking and do not put their capital at risk. The only thing that changes is how the already-earned yield is distributed.

In traditional staking, rewards are paid proportionally to stake size, which can feel very insignificant for small accounts with balances. 

With Tramplin.io, a portion of the yield is redistributed as random, larger payouts. This gives even small users a genuine opportunity for a meaningful increase.

But this is a chance, not a guarantee. We make no promises of extra yield or fixed returns. The distribution happens under transparent, verifiable on-chain rules, and every user has access to this data.

The approach does follow the same principle as UK Premium Bonds: there might be some time without any yield, but if there's a reward, it can be significantly higher than standard APY. And I think it's important to mention that the original capital is always preserved.

Invezz: DeFi often promises high APYs without clarity. What does “honest yield” mean in practice for Tramplin.io?

“Honest yield” means the source is clear, transparent, and doesn't rely on endless new money or hidden risks.

In Tramplin.io, rewards only come from Solana's native rewards system, which means no additional token emissions, no risky strategies, and no redistribution from newbies to pros. 

No fake 300% APY promises that collapse later. Just a real chance to get more than standard staking without illusions of fixed returns and without risking users' money.

Invezz: Who controls the stake account, and what happens if the Tramplin.io interface goes down or disappears entirely?

The staking account is 100% under the user's control; it's a standard native Solana staking account. We never have access to the funds; there's no custody.

If, for any reason, the Tramplin.io interface disappears or shuts down, nothing changes for the user. They can open any compatible wallet like Phantom or Backpack, check their stake, and withdraw it, following regular Solana rules. Everything is built so that even in the worst-case scenario, users keep their funds. 

Invezz: You ran a Dune analysis on “sleeping wallets.” What does it say about how retail behaves on Solana today?

We looked at wallets holding 1–100 SOL (that's typical retail size): our data showed about 2 million wallets holding SOL without staking. Only around 560,000 wallets in that range actually stake.

The reason? Regular staking gives tiny rewards of $2-5 a month that don't (usually) motivate people. After what the industry has experienced through 2021-2025, folks are scared of risky alternatives, so they just sit on their SOL.

That's a huge amount of idle capital: millions of people believe in Solana but aren't actually participating in the network. 

Give them a safe, engaging way to join, and they'll start participating.

What we're seeing with Tramplin.io: users start with 1 SOL, try our model, like the experience, and start adding more.

Invezz: From your perspective, what's the most realistic way to bring new users into the Solana ecosystem, and how can products like Tramplin.io help make that onboarding stick?

The most realistic way to attract new people to Solana isn't hype or quick “get-rich” schemes; it's making crypto feel like traditional finance, but faster, easier, more accessible, and more meaningful. 

Newcomers need to have the ability to start with a small amount, test things out without risks, and then they need a reason to stay and continue.

Solana is already leading here: it provides instant transactions, low fees, and user-friendly wallets like Phantom or Backpack, even for total beginners. But to keep people engaged after their first try, you need products with a familiar TradFi-like experience, not casino vibes.

And long-term holders and users are what really support the network.

Invezz: What do you think the crypto industry is missing right now, and what kind of crypto culture are you trying to bring back?

The industry is missing responsibility and real respect for users.

We started with open systems, equal access, and tech that could change the world and improve people's lives. Then crypto became a place where most products either don't solve any real problems or are built to make money quickly and leave.

The culture I want to bring back is to build things that genuinely make everyday lives better. 

The one where the market's decline doesn't mean total losses, where security is built into the architecture of the product and is not just a marketing buzzword. 

The culture where small users don't feel left out and have a real shot to participate. That's what I want to see and build.

Delayed from 19 December 2025 due to the festive season, commencement order number 6 for the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 (DUAA) crept onto the statute books with little fanfare. In case you missed it, 5 February 2026, is the day when most of the remaining provisions of DUAA entered into force.

A swathe of provisions got the green light, including the new approach to ADM, which unless special category data is involved, moves to a permission but with safeguards regime, meaning certain decisions may no longer be subject to the more severe restrictions on automated decision-making. (For more information see the ADM section of our article here).

The new UK test for data bridges (formerly known as ""adequacy"", pre-Brexit) also enters into force, meaning the test is now whether the standards of data protection will be ""materially lower"" than those applicable in the UK. (Previously the test was whether the standards were ""essentially equivalent""). You may want to take advantage of the new test when completing your Transfer Risk Assessments (TRAs) for transfers from the UK but there is no urgency to review existing TRAs as they will remain fit for purpose. (For more information see the Data Transfers section in our article here).

Also in force are the remaining amendments to the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (PECR), including the headline grabbing UK GDPR level fines (i.e. maximum £17.5 million or 4% of global annual turnover, whichever is higher), the extension of the cookie consent rules to anyone who ""instigates"" the storage or access to stored data, wider enforcement powers for PECR breaches, soft opt-in for charities, the relaxation of exemptions for cookie consent where they pose a low risk to user privacy and the ICO's task of encouraging industry to produce codes of conduct. (For more information see our e-Privacy section in our article here). We know the ICO is very active when it comes to PECR breaches so anyone taking a risk based view on PECR requirements particularly in respect of marketing campaigns should be reconsidering their risk profile given the stakes have become significantly higher for non-compliance!

The remaining data rights, bar one, are also commenced, clarifying time limits for responding to data subjects' requests, the information to be provided to data subjects and fees and reasons for responses to data subjects' requests about law enforcement processing. The remaining right, yet to be commenced, is the new ""right to complain"" to controllers regarding general UK GDPR compliance. (For more information see the Data Rights section of our article here). This right will come into force on 19 June 2026 so if you haven't already reviewed your complaints process, worked out how to resource it given the likely increase in direct complaints and revised your privacy notices, the clock is ticking with little over 4 months to get your house in order. Keep an eye out for the ICO's final guidance too, which is still expected Winter 2025/2026 (even if we are now, thank goodness, through the 2025 part of Winter!) .

All the new wide-ranging ICO powers are in force, bringing the ICO into line with other UK regulators. (For more information see the IC's new powers section of our article here). Again, if you haven't already familiarised yourself with the powers, it would be prudent to do so as these will change how the ICO currently conducts its investigations.

Finally, both the new ""recognised legitimate interests"" lawful basis and the purpose limitation clarification are also brought into force. (For more information see the relevant sections of our article here). We don't think either provision will have a huge impact on organisations, rather they provide welcome clarity and for most of us the legitimate interests assessment (LIA) will still be necessary, unless you fall within the narrow scope of the new ""recognised legitimate interests"". If this is the case and you seek to rely on this new lawful basis you will need to update your privacy notices and ROPAs to reflect this. 

We still await the changes to the ICO's structure. (For more information see the IC section of our article here). It remains to be seen when the Information Commission will come into being but with appointments to the new Board well underway it might be sooner, rather than later. 

So what?

As it was third time lucky before data reform was enacted in the UK, many compliance teams preferred to wait until DUAA received Royal Assent and there was certainty about the road ahead. Now with the majority of provisions in force the direction of travel is clear, so if you haven't already refreshed your policies and privacy notices, considered your TRAs for transfers from the UK, discussed what the ADM changes mean for your organisation, what the new PECR reforms mean for your marketing strategy, how the new ICO powers will impact your approach to regulatory investigations etc. etc., now is the time to do so. If you have any questions about these changes, how to implement them for your business or would like training/a workshop for your team please do reach out to your usual LS contact.","{'href': 'https://www.lewissilkin.com', 'title': 'lewissilkin.com'}","cryptocurrency"

India has again shown it prefers strict regulation over market freedom in the cryptocurrency sector. In the Union Budget 2026–2027, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the government will keep its tough tax rules for Virtual Digital Assets (VDAs).

While the private crypto market remains under heavy pressure, the government is simultaneously accelerating the adoption of its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), specifically through a new “Digital Food Currency” pilot.

This dual-track strategy highlights India's intent to harness blockchain technology exclusively within state-controlled frameworks while discouraging speculative private trading.

Even after strong efforts from local exchanges and the Bharat Web3 Association, the 2026 Budget does not give any relief to crypto investors. The tax rules set in 2022 still make it very hard to enter the market:

BREAKING: 🇮🇳 India's Crypto stance, straight from Parliament:

A common belief is:“Crypto isn't regulated in India, so it's basically invisible.”

Parliament says otherwise 👇

What the government has made clear:

➡️ Crypto, VDAs & NFTs are not regulated➡️ But they are very… pic.twitter.com/xtt0SPFFO3

— Sapna Singh (@earnwithsapna) February 7, 2026



The impact of these policies is visible in the data. Recent reports suggest that over 72% of India's crypto trading volume has migrated to offshore platforms.

This flight of capital has resulted in an estimated loss of billions in potential domestic tax revenue, as traders seek jurisdictions with more favorable tax environments.

The Finance Bill 2026 adds new enforcement rules, focusing more on strict reporting than just collecting revenue. From April 1, 2026, anyone who does not report VDA transactions correctly will face serious financial penalties:

Interestingly, the government has balanced these fines with a slight easing of criminal liability. The maximum jail term for TDS defaulters has been reduced from seven years to two years, suggesting a shift toward proportional punishment while maintaining high financial deterrents.

As private crypto faces more limits, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is focusing more on the “e-Rupee.” This month, a new pilot for CBDC-based food coupons will start in Chandigarh and Puducherry.

This program shows the government's position: it supports blockchain for social welfare and government use, but not for decentralized finance (DeFi) or investment speculation.

India's strategy is still a “walled garden” approach. By keeping taxes and penalties high for private crypto, the government is limiting retail speculation. At the same time, by using CBDC in the Public Distribution System (PDS), India aims to lead in state-run digital currency.","{'href': 'https://www.fxleaders.com', 'title': 'FXLeaders'}","cryptocurrency"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cbdc","The Digital Rupee: India's Central Bank Digital Currency Initiative","https://www.indialaw.in/blog/banking-and-finance/digital-rupee-e%E2%82%B9-indias-cbdc-explained-simply/","Mon, 09 Feb 2026 09:46:15 GMT","

The Digital Rupee, designated as e₹, represents a pivotal advancement in India's monetary system, embodying the nation's transition toward a comprehensive Central Bank Digital Currency framework. As a digital manifestation of the traditional Indian Rupee, the e₹ operates under the direct authority and issuance of the Reserve Bank of India, maintaining equivalency with physical currency while leveraging technological innovations to enhance transactional efficiency. 

The implementation of the e₹ constitutes a strategic response to the evolving global financial landscape, wherein central banks worldwide are exploring digital alternatives to conventional monetary systems. This initiative reflects India's commitment to maintaining monetary sovereignty while embracing technological modernization in financial services. 

The Digital Rupee derives its legal authority from Section 26 of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, establishing its status as legal tender throughout the territorial jurisdiction of India. This statutory foundation ensures that e₹ carries the same legal weight and acceptance obligations as traditional currency, creating binding obligations for acceptance by all entities within the Indian financial ecosystem. 

The regulatory framework governing e₹ operations establishes comprehensive oversight mechanisms ensuring compliance with existing monetary laws while accommodating the unique characteristics of digital currency systems. The Reserve Bank of India maintains exclusive authority over issuance, distribution, and regulatory supervision of the Digital Rupee, preserving the integrity of India's monetary policy framework. 

The Digital Rupee operates through a sophisticated technological infrastructure designed to facilitate seamless integration with existing banking systems while maintaining operational independence. Users access e₹ through dedicated applications provided by authorized financial institutions, creating a secure digital environment for currency storage and transaction processing. 

The system architecture ensures continuous availability, enabling users to conduct transactions, load funds, and manage their digital wallets beyond conventional banking hours. This twenty-four-hour operational capacity represents a significant advancement over traditional banking limitations, enhancing user convenience and financial accessibility. 

The technological framework incorporates advanced security protocols to protect user data and financial assets against cyber threats. These security measures include encrypted transaction processing, secure wallet management, and comprehensive fraud prevention systems that maintain the integrity of the digital currency ecosystem. 

The Digital Rupee incorporates several distinctive features that differentiate it from existing payment systems and digital financial instruments. Unlike traditional payment interfaces that merely facilitate fund transfers between bank accounts, e₹ functions as both a payment mechanism and a store of value, providing users with enhanced financial flexibility. 

The system supports fractional denomination transactions, mirroring the divisibility characteristics of physical currency while enabling precise value transfers. This capability ensures that e₹ maintains the practical utility of cash transactions while providing the convenience and efficiency of digital processing. 

A particularly innovative feature of the Digital Rupee involves its programmable characteristics, enabling the implementation of conditional spending parameters. This functionality allows for the establishment of usage restrictions based on temporal, geographical, or purpose-specific criteria, creating opportunities for targeted financial policy implementation and enhanced transaction control. 

The Digital Rupee platform prioritises user experience through intuitive interface design and comprehensive accessibility features. The system supports multiple device platforms, ensuring broad compatibility across various technological environments and user preferences. 

Transaction processing incorporates familiar payment methodologies, including QR code scanning and point-of-sale integration, facilitating smooth adoption by both merchants and consumers. The elimination of minimum balance requirements for e₹ wallets removes traditional banking barriers, promoting financial inclusion across diverse economic segments. 

The platform's design philosophy emphasises simplicity and efficiency, enabling users to perform complex financial operations through straightforward digital interfaces. This approach reduces the learning curve associated with digital currency adoption while maintaining sophisticated underlying functionality. 

The Digital Rupee occupies a unique position within India's financial ecosystem, distinguishing itself from existing payment. While traditional digital payment platforms facilitate transactions between existing bank accounts, e₹ represents actual digital currency holdings that can be stored, transferred, and utilized independently of conventional banking relationships. 

This fundamental distinction creates new possibilities for financial interaction, enabling direct peer-to-peer value transfer without intermediary banking infrastructure. The implications of this capability extend beyond mere transactional convenience, potentially transforming the underlying structure of financial relationships and monetary circulation. 

The Digital Rupee incorporates comprehensive security measures designed to protect user assets and maintain system integrity. Advanced encryption protocols secure all transaction data and wallet information, ensuring that financial activities remain confidential and protected from unauthorized access. 

The security architecture includes provisions for device loss or theft scenarios, maintaining wallet security through multi-factor authentication and remote access controls. These protective measures ensure that user funds remain secure, building confidence in digital currency adoption. 

Regular security audits and continuous monitoring systems identify and address potential vulnerabilities, maintaining the highest standards of digital security throughout the e₹ ecosystem. This proactive approach to security management reflects the critical importance of user trust in digital currency success. 

The implementation of the Digital Rupee carries significant implications for India's monetary policy framework and economic structure. The ability to track digital currency circulation provides enhanced visibility into monetary flows, potentially improving the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policy interventions. 

The programmable nature of e₹ creates opportunities for targeted economic stimulus measures and conditional spending programs, enabling more precise policy implementation than traditional monetary tools. These capabilities may prove particularly valuable in addressing specific economic challenges or promoting particular policy objectives. 

The current pilot phase of the Digital Rupee serves as a foundation for broader implementation and feature development. Ongoing evaluation of user adoption patterns, technological performance, and operational efficiency will inform future expansion decisions and system enhancements. 

The scalability of the underlying technology platform positions the e₹ for potential integration with international digital currency systems, creating possibilities for enhanced cross-border payment efficiency and reduced transaction costs in international trade.

Tom Boggioni is a writer, born, raised and living in San Diego — where he attended San Diego State University. Prior to writing for Raw Story, he wrote for FireDogLake, blogged as TBogg, and worked in banking, marketing and construction.

Donald Trump's relationship with cryptocurrency advocates has deteriorated as digital currency values decline and his administration falters on crypto legislation.

According to Axios reporter Zachary Basu, members of the ""hyper-online, male-dominated crypto space"" who supported Trump's 2024 campaign are experiencing buyer's remorse. Initial enthusiasm has soured following Trump-branded meme coins that generated massive profits for insiders while leaving retail traders with worthless tokens.

Complications intensified after revelations that the Trump family's crypto venture generated hundreds of millions in revenue, including through a secret investment by an Emirati royal. The subsequent cryptocurrency market decline, combined with stalled crypto legislation due to Trump's conflicts with Democrats over his personal dealings, has frustrated investors.

Axios reported, ""Despite multiple factors driving bitcoin's downturn, the president once hailed as crypto's greatest ally has now become one of its most visible scapegoats.""

Crypto evangelist Carl Runefelt expressed regret on social media: ""For everyone who listened to me when I said we go to $300,000 this cycle: I'm terribly sorry… I was wrong. At least I lost more than you… I'm shocked actually about this cycle. WHAT WENT WRONG??? It all seemed so perfect one year ago.""

Runefelt subsequently added, ""Yeah, trump was a reason for me to believe in $300k. At the end he was bad for crypto… Big mistake to have him as president.""

Another crypto investor, Bitcoin Teddy, sarcastically observed, ""When Trump said we wouldn't have to pay taxes on crypto gains, I didn't realize he was removing the gains.""

While evidence remains unclear regarding whether crypto backlash will influence upcoming midterm elections, Axios notes a broader pattern: ""The backlash captures a deeper problem for Trump: Niche and newly mobilized constituencies he courted in 2024 are growing disillusioned with his presidency.""

When Coinbase speaks on regulation, lawmakers pause","https://www.arkrepublic.com/2026/02/09/regulatory-legislation-of-cryptocurrency-is-still-a-squabble-what-is-clear-when-coinbase-speaks-on-regulation-lawmakers-pause/","Mon, 09 Feb 2026 09:00:35 GMT","

For more than a decade, cryptocurrency wrestled with a contradiction. Once a platform that emerged as the darling of shadow banking, it is now the front-facing system in the economic global reset.



Gone are the days of digital currency via a blockchain network being propagated by dark web aficionados. Rather than banner-waving crypto-bros lauded as economic oracles of an underground powerhouse, cryptocurrency has become quite the complicated it girl in market restructuring.

Under the Trump Administration, crypto has been positioned as the future currency of choice. Yet, it currently struggles to coexist with regulatory systems designed for traditional finance. As Congress works to fold in a less volatile digital currency market, it also disrupts a subaltern commerce culture.

Given its original promise of decentralization—which means monetary activities freed from the clutches of centralized banking systems—crypto sits in a political quandary. Because of its salience in the market, the tension in how to shift from an unregulated to regulated monetary system was a theoretical possibility. Today, it is a legislative, cultural, and economic practice. 

At the center of crypto's existential crisis is Coinbase. Initially, Coinbase served as a simple, consumer on-ramp for buying, selling and converting Bitcoin. In the transition to a more regulated cryptocurrency, Coinbase has evolved into something far more consequential: a corporate political actor, a financial infrastructure provider, and increasingly, a cultural platform.

The corporate political actor. Coinbase's recent public break with the passage of the Clarity Act, demonstrated how deep the platform's influence is in the political sphere. If passed, the bill to establish “a regulatory framework for digital commodities,” would be landmark legislation.

While the proposed law passed in the House, hours before the Senate Banking Committee planned to move it forward for a congressional vote, Coinbase pulled its support. The company cited that it disagreed with the amendments made to the Clarity Act when it was sent to the Senate.

“We'd rather have no bill than a bad bill,” Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said, explaining the company's position. After reviewing the draft text, Armstrong added that “Coinbase unfortunately can't support the bill as written.”

One major issue in the Senate's version of the Clarity Act is the limitations placed on Stablecoins. A cryptocurrency backed by Coinbase, Stablecoins aim to reduce the volatility by offering price stability with a digital token backed by the same equivalent in cash or equivalent reserves.

The company's objection was not to oversight itself, but to provisions it argued would lock crypto into a restrictive framework. Armstrong warned that the legislation could be “materially worse than the status quo,” citing limits on tokenized assets, privacy-preserving finance, and especially stablecoin rewards.

Subsequently, Coinbase's withdrawal of its support for the Clarity Act halted the Senate Banking Committee. It also sent a clear message to Washington. As one of the foremost leaders in fintech, its stance said that regulatory clarity alone is insufficient when it comes at the cost of future innovation.

The rise of Base

“A global economy built for all of us” is the motto of Coinbase's software program, Base. Whereas the parent entity deals with fiscal transactions, the tech progeny serves as a social financial layer. By using Base, its cultural arm of digital currency, Coinbase is no longer reacting to regulation and adoption, it actively shapes them with a powerful triumvirate—policy, coded programs and a belief system.

By taking that stance publicly, Coinbase reframed its role. Instead of quietly lobbying for incremental changes, it positioned itself as a long-term steward of the crypto economy, willing to absorb short-term uncertainty to avoid long-term damage.

Nowhere is Coinbase's philosophy clearer than in its defense of stablecoins.

Stablecoins are often treated as background infrastructure, useful but unremarkable. Coinbase sees them differently. In its view, stablecoins are the connective tissue between crypto and everyday economic life, powering payments, savings, payroll, remittances, and on-chain commerce.

One of the company's major concerns with the Clarity Act was what multiple reports described as provisions that could effectively “kill rewards on stablecoins.” For Coinbase, that was not a minor detail. It struck at the heart of how digital dollars can compete with, and improve upon, traditional banking products.

Armstrong has previously argued that consumers deserve better outcomes from financial innovation. “Consumers deserve a bigger piece of the pie,” he said in earlier commentary on stablecoin interest, noting that on-chain yields could “force us all to up our game for the ultimate benefit of consumers.”

In that light, Coinbase's resistance to restrictive stablecoin rules is less about corporate profit and more about defining who benefits from the next financial system, big boy institutions or common folk?

If regulation is the institutional battlefront, Coinbase positions itself to be the cultural frontline. 

Technically, Base is a Layer 2 network. That means it is a secondary framework or protocol built on top of an existing blockchain (Layer 1) to significantly increase transaction speed, scalability, and reduce fees. Yet, in practice, it is becoming a social financial layer where identity, content, and capital intersect. On Base, profiles double as wallets, and posts become assets. Ultimately for users, engagement is no longer measured solely in likes or followers, but in economic participation.

Because it touts itself as the “everything app” much like WeChat, supporting a creator early on Base—including collecting a post, or backing a community—can carry financial meaning. Value no longer flows only upward to platforms. It can accrue sideways, and sometimes directly, to individuals.

This shift introduces a powerful idea: personal market cap.

In crypto-native social environments, a person's reputation, consistency, and community can translate into on-chain demand. Identity itself becomes investable. People are no longer just users generating data for platforms. They are markets with quantifiable value.

Taken together, Coinbase's regulatory posture, its stablecoin advocacy, and its investment in Base suggest a company redefining its mission. Coinbase is not trying to be just another bank with 4 plus percent yield nor simply another instagramish social network. It is building the infrastructure where banking, markets, and social identity converge.

That ambition explains why its decisions now ripple far beyond its own balance sheet. As the Clarity Act is in limbo, now industry persons know when Coinbase enters the regulation area, lawmakers acknowledge how it builds; how it engages developers; and the ways in which Base creators experiment. Then when it draws a line in the sand, the industry recalibrates.

The question is no longer whether crypto will be regulated or adopted. That outcome is inevitable. The real question is who sculpts and formulates the rules, and who captures the value.

As crypto moves from assets to identities, from platforms to people, a new metric begins to matter.

Moving forward, the question will be, “what's your market cap?” And not just the market capitalization (market cap or value) of a company or a token, but your personal valuation in the crypto economy. Whether it involves the Base blockchain or other emerging currencies, your involvement is crucial, whether it pertains to the Base blockchain or other emerging cryptocurrencies.

Cryptocurrency kiosks are found in retail stores, convenience stores, and gas stations.

Daniel Roe, advocacy and community engagement manager for AARP Kentucky, said House Bill 380 requires operators to be licensed, mandates user ID verification, and sets daily transaction limits.

""If someone wanted to deposit $22,000 into a crypto ATM at a gas station, they could do that today,"" Roe pointed out. ""It could very well be fraudulent, scam-related activity, so what the bill proposed, currently, as it stands, is a $500 daily transaction limit.""

As of 2024, there were more than 30,000 crypto kiosks nationwide, according to AARP. The bill has been introduced to the Kentucky House and referred to the Committee on Banking and Insurance.

Roe noted that across the state, those who live and work near crypto kiosk locations often witness scams.

""They have cash, money, or a bank envelope. They're talking on the phone,"" Roe outlined. ""They may look distressed. It could be an older adult.""

The federal Consumer Protection Bureau advised people to never believe anyone who says you need to use a crypto ATM to protect your money or fix a problem, even if they claim to be from a recognized institution or government agency.

The bank is building infrastructure to support digital asset offerings

UBS is preparing a gradual expansion into crypto trading and tokenized financial services, as the bank builds core infrastructure to support digital assets and blockchain-based products.

Chief executive Sergio Ermotti confirmed that UBS is developing systems to support crypto access for individual clients as well as tokenized deposit solutions for corporate customers.

The bank plans to prioritize infrastructure and targeted use cases before scaling its digital asset activities over a three-to-five-year timeframe.

The move represents a shift from UBS's earlier stance on cryptocurrencies. In previous years, senior executives expressed skepticism about the role of assets such as Bitcoin, questioning their function as money or a store of value.

As a result, UBS avoided direct crypto trading for an extended period and limited its digital asset efforts to internal blockchain experiments and research projects.

In recent years, however, the bank has steadily expanded its work on tokenization, focusing on applications that align more closely with traditional financial markets.

In 2022, UBS issued a $50 million tokenized note, marking one of its first live uses of blockchain technology for securities issuance. The bank has since continued to test tokenized structures across funds, settlement, and cash-equivalent products.

More recently, in November 2025, UBS executed a live tokenized fund transaction using Chainlink infrastructure, highlighting how blockchain technology can be applied to asset management processes. The bank has also explored tokenized money market funds on Ethereum, offering blockchain-based access to low-risk, short-term assets.

By positioning itself as a “fast follower”,  UBS is aiming to adopt proven models once regulatory and operational risks are better understood, while integrating digital assets into its existing banking framework.

Japan's Nikkei 225 surged to a record on Monday, breaching the 57,000 level with a 3.4% gain following Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's decisive ""supermajority"" victory in the Sunday general election, according to Nikkei Asia. 

This political mandate signaled a green light for Takaichi's aggressive expansionary fiscal agenda, which includes a massive $135 billion stimulus package aimed at revitalizing the economy through infrastructure spending and tax cuts. 

The ""Takaichi Trade"" sparked a global ripple effect, driving gold prices past the $5,000 per ounce milestone and pushing bitcoin to a brief peak of $72,000, before settling back above $70,000 during Asia morning trading hours. U.S. stock market futures opened higher. 

The market euphoria was further bolstered by international support, with both President Donald Trump and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent congratulating the Prime Minister.

Bitcoin BTC$70,411.45 has retreated by nearly 2.5% in the past 24 hours after failing to hold onto gains made during an end-of-week bounce that pushed it back up to $71,000.

The pullback followed a turbulent few days in which the cryptocurrency plunged to as low as $60,000 before rebounding. BTC is still down more than 11% in the past seven days.

Even so, it's outperforming the wider market, which saw the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index drop 13.5% over 24 hours and 13.7% in a week.

The drop saw institutions move. Speaking to CNBC, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley said late last week that the firm saw significant inflows as prices dropped.

“I think long-time holders are feeling unsure, and I think the new investor set — institutions — are feeling they're getting a new crack at the apple and seeing prices they thought they'd forever missed,” Horsley said.

Spot bitcoin ETFs on Friday reversed a three-day streak of outflows, bringing in a net $371 million, SoSoValue data shows. Still, retail sentiment remained fragile. Julio Moreno, CryptoQuant's head of research, noted on social media that U.S. investors are buying back in, based on the Coinbase Premium Index turning positive for the first time since mid-January.

Online search interest for terms such as “crypto capitulation” spiked during the selloff and stayed elevated, according to crypto analytics firm Santiment, offering an opportunity for value investors to step in.

Meanwhile, capital flowed into traditional safe havens. Gold and silver extended their recovery after a selloff late last month, with gold once again topping $5,000 as investors consider a weaker U.S. dollar and major purchasers continued accumulating. These include Tether, whose gold stash has topped $23 billion, and China's central bank.

Stock market futures are down ahead of the open, after a Japan equities rallied over the ruling party's landslide win in a snap election. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi had campaigned on low interest rates and significant fiscal spending.

The yield on Japanese government bonds kept rising, further unwinding the yen carry trade and affecting risk assets including cryptocurrencies. The unwind could bring nearly $5 trillion of overseas investments back into the country. Stay alert!

Bitcoin miner Cango (CANG) completed the sale 4,451 BTC over the weekend, raising roughly $305 million in USDT as it looks to reduce leverage and reposition its business around artificial intelligence infrastructure.

The company said it raised $305 million from the sale, suggesting an average sale price of about $68,524 per coin, or not far above multi-year low prices for bitcoin.

Shares are little-changed in Monday trading, but are lower by 83% on a year-over-year basis.

The company's bitcoin sales were “based on a comprehensive assessment of current market conditions,” the firm said, as it plans to shift into AI computing infrastructure. Cango plans to deploy modular GPU units across its global network of over 40 sites to serve small and mid-sized businesses needing on-demand AI inference capacity, it said.

The company used the proceeds of its BTC sale to pay down a bitcoin-collateralized loan, bolstering its balance sheet. The company still holds 3,645 BTC worth more than $250 million, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.

“In response to recent market conditions, we have made a treasury adjustment to strengthen balance sheet and reduce financial leverage, which provides increased capacity to fund our strategic expansion into AI compute infrastructure,” the company wrote in a letter to shareholders.

Its move into the AI sector comes as it faces what it framed as a gap between rising compute demand and existing grid capacity. Cango wrote that it's well positioned to take advantage of that gap.

Cango is not alone. A growing group of bitcoin miners is scaling back exposure to pure mining and redirecting capital and infrastructure toward AI data centers and high-performance computing.

Bitfarms (BITF) has said it plans to exit crypto mining entirely by around 2027, and famously declared it's no longer a bitcoin company as it shifts to high-performance computing and AI workloads.

Analysts at KBW have warned that the industry's pivot toward AI workloads is compelling, but that the path to monetization is fraught with execution risks. That led to a downgrade not only on Bitfarms but also in Bitdeer (BTDR) and Hive Digital (HIVE).","{'href': 'https://www.coindesk.com', 'title': 'CoinDesk'}","cryptocurrency"

Crypto markets opened the week under pressure, extending losses after a volatile weekend as bitcoin BTC$70,411.45 showed tentative signs of stabilizing below $70,000.

Even though the largest cryptocurrency dropped more than 2.8% in the last 24 hours, it remains well off its recent lows of around $60,000. Still, it has struggled to regain momentum after last week's steep drop that reignited debate over whether the market has entered a deeper bear phase or is nearing a bottom. 

Bitcoin bulls pointed to slowing downside moves as a sign of exhaustion, even as critics took victory laps. Nevertheless, attention is being paid to software stocks, some of which started to rebound as concerns of a deeper collapse ease.

The CoinDesk 5 Index (CD5) fell 3.4%, with all five of the largest cryptocurrencies declining.

Mathematicians discover new ways to make round shapes

A new proof solves a long-standing problem about the doughnut-shaped torus

By Rachel Crowell edited by Clara Moskowitz

Imagine that you want to know the most efficient way to make a torus—a doughnut-shaped mathematical object—from origami paper. But this torus, which is a surface, looks drastically different than the outside of a glazed bakery doughnut. Instead of seeming almost perfectly smooth, the torus that you envision is jagged with many faces, each of which is a polygon. In other words, you want to construct a polyhedral torus with faces that are shapes such as triangles or rectangles.

Your peculiar-looking shape will be trickier to construct than one with a smooth surface. The complexity of the problem only grows if you decide that you want to envision constructing something similar but in four or more dimensions.

Mathematician Richard Evan Schwartz of Brown University tackled the problem in a recent study by working backward from an existing polyhedral torus to answer questions about what would be needed to construct it from scratch. He posted his findings to a preprint server in August 2025.

Schwartz was able to find a solution to a long-standing question: What's the minimum number of vertices (corners) needed to make polyhedral tori with a property called intrinsic flatness? The answer, Schwartz found, is eight vertices. He first demonstrated that seven vertices aren't enough. He then discovered an example of an intrinsically flat polyhedral torus with eight vertices.

“It's very striking that Rich Schwartz was able to entirely solve this well-known problem,” says Jean-Marc Schlenker, a mathematician at the University of Luxembourg. “The problem looks elementary but had been open for many years.”

Schwartz's finding essentially provides the minimum number of vertices that a polyhedral torus needs so that it can be flattened. But one detail—what it means to be “intrinsically flat” rather than simply “flat”—is a bit complicated to parse. The notion is also central to connecting Schwartz's results to the question of building polyhedral tori from scratch.

Since the 1960s mathematicians have known that intrinsically flat versions of mathematical objects exist. Actually finding those objects is a different beast, Schwartz notes. Describing polyhedral tori as intrinsically flat isn't quite equivalent to simply saying that they're flat like a piece of paper. Instead it means that these surfaces have the same dimensions as (or, as mathematicians say, “are isometric to”) tori that are smooshed flat. “Another way to say it is that if you compute the angle sums around each vertex, it adds up to 2π everywhere,” Schwartz says.

According to Schlenker, Schwartz's finding is very on-brand for his expertise. Yet for many years, Schwartz was so stumped by the problem that he set it aside.

He first heard about the quandary in 2019, when two of his mathematician friends—Alba Málaga Sabogal and Samuel Lelièvre—brought it to him. “They thought I would be interested in this because I had solved this thing called Thompson's problem, which was about electrons on a sphere,” Schwartz says. “They thought [Thompson's problem was] about searching through a configuration space and trying to see which configuration was best amongst an infinite number of possibilities, and these origami tori have a similar kind of flavor.”

But Schwartz wasn't initially convinced. “Basically, they shoved it in my face, and at some point, years passed. I actually thought it was too hard of a problem,” he says. The difficulty stemmed from the large dimensions that seemed to be involved. “Even for just seven or eight [vertices], it seems that you would have to look at 20-some-odd-dimensional space,” he says.

But when the three mathematicians reunited in 2025, Schwartz learned that Lelièvre's roommate, Vincent Tugayé,had found an example that worked with nine vertices. “It was a really pretty thing” that Tugayé, a high school teacher with a Ph.D. in physics, exhibited at math outreach fairs in Paris, Schwartz says. “I thought, ‘Well, this one's got to be the best,'” adds Schwartz, who then set out to settle whether his intuition was correct.

To approach the question of whether the cases with seven or eight vertices would work, Schwartz focused on answering “How do I cut down the dimension?” He generated a lot of ideas about how to do so for the seven vertices case. Yet he ultimately stumbled upon a mathematical gift of sorts: a little known 1991 paper that “goes about 80 percent of the way to proving that you can't do it with seven vertices,” he says. “Then I just finished it off.”

Still thinking that the eight vertices case also wouldn't work, he then tried to use a similar approach to prove that claim. When he found he couldn't rule out some cases, he decided to figure out what properties an eight-vertex torus would need to have to be intrinsically flat. Using an approach that he describes as “heavily supervised machine learning,” Schwartz then found an eight-vertex example that did work.

“What's most striking, I think, is that it's another example of the specific skills that Rich Schwartz has developed, blending traditional mathematical investigation with computational methods,” Schlenker says. “He finds beautiful geometric ideas to prove some results but also writes elaborate programs to search for and find examples. Very few mathematicians are capable of bringing those two strands together so harmoniously.”

How the ‘Quad God' lands impossible jumps

How do figure skaters like Ilia Malinin keep landing harder and harder jumps?

By Allison Parshall edited by Andrea Thompson

Ilia Malinin competes in the Championship Men Free Skating during the 2026 United States Figure Skating Championships at Enterprise Center on January 10, 2026, in St Louis, Mo.

From skating to curling, the thrilling sports of the Winter Olympics have plenty of science behind them. Follow our coverage here to learn more.

For at least a decade, the quadruple axel jump was figure skating's white whale. “It's been this unreachable thing, like the four-minute mile” once was, says Matthew Lind, a technical specialist for U.S. Figure Skating. Throughout the 2010s male skaters kept landing new jumps that rotate four times in the air: the lutz, the loop, the flip. But at 4.5 rotations, the quad axel is a special case, and it remained incredibly risky to attempt, let alone to perfect.

Then came Ilia Malinin. In a video on the U.S. skater's Instagram, he lands two in a row with only a split second between them, like it's nothing. He became the first—and still, the only—skater to land the quad axel in competition in 2022. He calls himself the Quad God, and it's hard to disagree with him.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

“He's a phenom,” says figure skating coach and former Olympian Karen Preston. His jumps “are pretty darn close to perfect.”

Malinin represents the direction in which figure skating has been moving for at least 20 years, rewarding harder and flashier jumps. I spoke with figure skating coaches and biomechanics researchers to learn how these jumps became possible, what makes Malinin special, and whether we're headed toward the era of quintuples.

From a physics perspective, the six main jumps of figure skating are variations on the same theme. Skaters glide along the ice to build momentum, then twist themselves up like springs and push off with explosive muscle movements. They have two goals: to jump high to maximize their time in the air and to rotate fast to complete the turns before their foot comes slamming back to the ice. During takeoff, skaters push off the ice at an angle, which lets them maximize angular momentum, or the ability to rotate quickly.

Each jump accomplishes this differently. The axel is the only jump in which skaters take off while facing forward, which is part of what makes it so difficult—because it is landed backward, skaters must rotate an extra half turn before they land. The five other jumps take off backward and can be launched from the figure skate blade's distinctive toe pick or from either of its two edges.

Amanda Montañez

Though the jumps may be similar physics-wise, for the human body, every jump is different. And they only get harder with more rotations, requiring skaters to propel higher and rotate faster. The margin for error becomes slim. “You're really putting your body at risk,” Lind says. For elite skaters, landing these harder jumps requires strength and conditioning, innate talent, mental focus, great coaches—and a slight body, explains biomechanics researcher Lee Cabell, who coaches figure skating at IceWorks Skating Club in Pennsylvania.

The importance of a narrow body comes down to physics. Because angular momentum must be conserved, skaters can't change their rotation potential once they're in the air. But they can change their spinning speed by pulling their arms close to their body. This movement brings more of the skater's mass closer to their axis of rotation, decreasing what's called their moment of inertia and increasing the speed of their rotation by making it require less force.

Narrower bodies, then, have the capacity to spin faster. “These very slight but muscular athletes really have the advantage for rotating,” says Sarah T. Ridge, a biomechanics researcher at the University of Hartford, who studies figure skating. With his slight body, immense talent, and parents who are former Olympians and double as his coaches, Malinin is a rare skater with the whole package, Cabell says. Another outlier is Nathan Chen, who landed five quads in one program at the 2022 Olympics and took home the gold. Both have dominated the sport, with scores far above the rest of the pack.

For a while, it seemed like quads were taking over women's skating, too. In the early 2020s the field was dominated by young, predominantly Russian teenagers who could land quads, a feat that is easier in narrower, prepubescent bodies. But after one of these young skaters was caught up in a doping scandal at the 2022 Olympics, the International Skating Union (ISU) raised the minimum age to compete to 17. Now the quad's relevance in women's skating has faded. All eyes there are on the triple axel, an element that was once very risky but which skaters are now landing with apparent ease, says Deborah King, who studies biomechanics at Ithaca College. This development is less likely to grab headlines, but it's another example of figure skating moving toward harder and harder jumps.

In some ways, the quad race was born from a massive judging scandal at the 2002 Olympics. At the time, judges awarded skaters a maximum of six points for both artistry and technique. During the Games, a French judge was pressured to inflate the scores for a Russian pairs team. In response to “skategate,” the ISU created a new scoring system that capped artistry scores at 10 points per judge but had no ceiling for technical scores, which are awarded for the difficulty of jumps, spins, and more. This means that, theoretically, skaters can always do more and harder jumps to surpass their competition, Lind says.

That's precisely what has happened. To be competitive, skaters have kept learning harder skills, and both they and their coaches have accumulated expertise along the way.

And like athletes in most sports, skaters have gotten a boost from advances in nutrition science, strength and conditioning practices, physical therapy, and injury prevention. “I think just small increments in all of those things can add up” to a skater that has enough strength and skill to land a quad comfortably, King says.

Technology has also given coaches more resources to teach harder jumps. Pole harnesses, for example, attach around skaters' torsos and connect to a rod their coach holds like a fishing pole. This allows coaches to support some of their students' weight in midair so they can try jumps they couldn't yet land on their own. These harnesses allow skaters to develop muscle memory and also protect them from injury. “We didn't have this when I was a skater. I look at these and I'm like, ‘Oh, that would have been nice,'” says Lind, who progressed to a triple axel before retiring in 2004.

But perhaps the most important technology is video analysis. About 20 years ago coaches started using a software called Dartfish that allows them to play back and overlay videos of their students' jumps in real time, Lind explains. “We're getting more people from different places doing harder skills, just because the information is more readily available and analyzable” for coaches, he says.

Preston specializes in Dartfish video analysis at the Toronto Cricket Skating and Curling Club. “This is where the science also eliminates the frustration,” she says. “Before, when we were learning how to do a jump, we were told, ‘Do it again, again, again.' Now we can break [the jump] down into extremely tangible moments.” The Skating Club of Boston, where Lind coaches, is also experimenting with three-dimensional cameras to give coaches even more valuable information about their skaters' technique.

Amanda Montañez

Scrutinizing every moment of a jump has also allowed coaches to re-think and sometimes change how they teach jump technique. For example, skaters were once told to look in the direction of their jump. “Nowadays, that is forbidden,” Preston says—it throws the head off axis, which decreases rotation speed. Coaches have also learned that higher jumps aren't necessarily better; higher jumps are harder to control.

“There's a lot of variables” in any given jump, Preston says. “Nobody's jumps look the same as anybody else's. And perfection doesn't really exist—unless you're looking at Ilia Malinin.”

Every expert I spoke with gushed about Malinin's technique. Not only does he land seemingly impossible jumps but he also does it with “astounding” ease, Ridge says. “When I'm watching his quads, I'm like, is that a triple or a quad—because it looks so easy.”

To Lind's expert eye, what makes Malinin's technique unique is his patience. He doesn't immediately rush to rotate his quad axel upon takeoff. Instead he waits, allowing him to climb a little higher than he would if he started rotating immediately. This takes a lot of guts, Lind says. “His personality is kind of a daredevil. He likes taking these risks.”

At this point, it seems inevitable that Malinin will land a quintuple jump. “I'm sure that kid has done quints. You cannot tell me that he has not tried it in practice,” Ridge says. “It's freaking amazing how his body works. And I go back and forth: Are there going to be more people like this?”

If history is any clue, we'll see other skaters catch up soon enough, as they eventually did with quadruple jumps. But so long as skate boots and blades do not change, we'll eventually reach a point where more rotations are impossible. “There will be a physical limit,” Cabell says. “And I think that quintuple is the limit.”

Whether this movement toward harder jumps is the right direction for skating's future is fiercely debated, both among the figure skating community and fans. “I do think that quads are here to stay, permanently, in all levels,” Preston says. Yet as jumps get more difficult, it becomes more challenging for skaters to balance technique with artistry.

One of Preston's students, Jason Brown, exemplifies the kind of figure skating that the quad era threatens to squash. Brown, a 31-year-old U.S. skater, is renowned for his artistry but has struggled to land quads. “Having been on Jason Brown's coaching team and knowing the magic that he has brought to the sport, I would hate to lose that,” she says.

Yellowstone's earthquakes spark microbial boom deep underground

Earthquake swarms can supercharge microbial growth

By Damien Pine edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

A swarm of 2,182 earthquakes at Yellowstone National Park was key for a new finding about microbes.

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

With some luck, specialized equipment, a supervolcano and a narrow hole 30 stories deep, researchers demonstrated that earthquakes shake up more than just rocks—they also boost microbe populations living underground.

Up to 30 percent of life on Earth doesn't ever see sunlight; instead these organisms get energy by chowing down on hydrogen generated through chemical interactions between water and rocks. Earthquakes fracture rocks, creating fresh reaction surfaces and shifting the pathways water travels along, which increase hydrogen production. For a study in PNAS Nexus, researchers tracked the effects of such shake-ups on microbes at the bottom of a 100-meter-deep borehole in Yellowstone National Park.

The scientists made a 10-hour round-trip trek to and from the test site seven times over seven months. There they collected samples of rock, dissolved gas and microbes, overcoming equipment malfunctions, logistical difficulties, and more along the way. The group was lucky enough to be taking measurements at just the right time—and in the ideal location—to perfectly catch the rise and fall of a rare “swarm” of 2,182 earthquakes. Yellowstone endures a lot of earthquakes, but swarms this powerful tend to occur every five to 10 years, says Montana State University geomicrobiologist Eric Boyd, the study's lead author.

During the swarm, the amount of microbial life present increased by 6.5 times before dropping back to normal after the tremors subsided. Hydrogen levels also increased, and the types of microbes observed changed. “All the pieces fit together nicely,” Boyd says. “We put all of these data together, and we're like, holy cow!”

The results might offer clues for finding life thriving under otherworldly surfaces, too. “Extrapolation to other planets and moons suggests that subsurface life might be most easily found in seismically active locations,” says Steven D'Hondt, who studies below-seafloor life at the University of Rhode Island and was not involved with the work. “It's a wonderful study,” he adds.

Caroline Freissinet, an astrobiologist at French research institute LATMOS who was not involved with the work, says that although it's a great result for understanding Earth, the study is unlikely to change much about the search for life on our nearest neighboring planet, Mars, because of its “hellish subsurface conditions.”

“Mars in the past was wetter,” she says, “but what would be left today of this temporarily enhanced activity, four billion years later?”

The Yellowstone study was “a really difficult project but a really meaningful one,” Boyd says. “Nobody had done this before.” He's now working on developing an automated sampler triggered by earthquakes to dramatically increase data collection.

Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is the most widespread form of hair loss, affecting millions of people around the world. Medications such as finasteride and minoxidil are widely prescribed, but concerns about side effects and long term use have pushed many patients to look for gentler, more holistic approaches. A new scientific review suggests that Polygonum multiflorum, a root used in traditional Chinese medicine for more than a thousand years to ""blacken hair and nourish essence,"" could be a promising alternative for managing AGA.

Most standard hair loss treatments are designed to act on a single biological pathway. Polygonum multiflorum appears to work differently. According to the review, the herb influences several processes at the same time. It helps reduce the effects of dihydrotestosterone, a hormone linked to follicle shrinkage, while also protecting hair follicle cells from premature cell death. In addition, it activates key growth related signaling systems such as Wnt and Shh and improves blood circulation in the scalp, which may enhance the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to hair follicles.

Ancient Records Meet Modern Biology

""Our analysis bridges ancient wisdom and modern science,"" said Han bixian, the first author of the review published in the Journal of Holistic Integrative Pharmacy. ""What surprised us was how consistently historical texts -- from the Tang Dynasty onward -- described effects that align perfectly with today's understanding of hair biology. Modern studies now confirm that this isn't folklore; it's pharmacology.""

The researchers examined a wide range of sources, including laboratory experiments, clinical observations, and historical herbal writings. Together, these sources paint a picture of a treatment that does more than slow hair thinning.

More Than Slowing Hair Loss

The review emphasizes that Polygonum multiflorum may actively support hair regeneration. Rather than simply delaying further loss, the herb appears to encourage regrowth by influencing multiple growth factors and signaling pathways involved in the hair cycle. This broad mode of action could make it more effective than treatments that focus on only one biological target.

Safety and the Need for Further Research

""When properly processed -- a key step in traditional preparation -- the herb shows a favorable safety profile, making it more acceptable to patients wary of side effects like sexual dysfunction or scalp irritation linked to current medications,"" This article highlights.

The authors caution that more high quality clinical trials are necessary to confirm these findings and determine optimal use. Even so, the review highlights how careful scientific study of traditional remedies can open the door to new treatment strategies for common conditions such as androgenetic alopecia.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists may have found the brain network behind Parkinson's","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260208203013.htm","Mon, 09 Feb 2026 01:38:19 GMT","

Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological condition that affects more than 1 million people in the United States and over 10 million worldwide. The disease causes a wide range of debilitating symptoms, including tremors, difficulty with movement, sleep problems, and cognitive decline. Current treatment options, such as long-term medications and invasive deep brain stimulation (DBS), can reduce symptoms, but they do not stop the disease from advancing or offer a cure.

An international research team led by China's Changping Laboratory, working alongside Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and other partners, has identified a specific brain region linked to the central features of Parkinson's disease. The researchers found that a brain network called the somato-cognitive action network (SCAN) plays a critical role in the disorder. When this network was targeted using a non-invasive experimental technique known as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), patients experienced more than twice the symptom improvement seen when nearby brain areas were stimulated instead.

The findings, published Feb. 4 in Nature, challenge long-standing views of Parkinson's disease and point toward a new era of more precise and targeted treatment approaches.

""This work demonstrates that Parkinson's is a SCAN disorder, and the data strongly suggest that if you target the SCAN in a personalized, precise manner you can treat Parkinson's more successfully than was previously possible,"" said co-author Nico U. Dosenbach, MD, PhD, the David M. & Tracy S. Holtzman Professor of Neurology at WashU Medicine. ""Changing the activity within SCAN could slow or reverse the progression of the disease, not just treat the symptoms.""

Understanding SCAN and Its Role in Movement and Thought

Dosenbach first described the SCAN in Nature in 2023. The network is located within the motor cortex, the area of the brain responsible for controlling body movements. Its job is to translate planned actions into physical motion and then monitor how those actions unfold. Because Parkinson's disease affects far more than movement alone, influencing digestion, sleep, motivation, and thinking, senior author Hesheng Liu, PhD, joined forces with Dosenbach to investigate whether disruptions in SCAN could explain the disease's broad range of symptoms and serve as a treatment target.

To test this idea, Liu's team analyzed brain imaging data from more than 800 participants across multiple research centers in the United States and China. The group included people with Parkinson's disease receiving DBS or non-invasive therapies such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, focused ultrasound stimulation, and medications. Healthy volunteers and individuals with other movement disorders were also included for comparison.

Abnormal Brain Connectivity Revealed

The analysis showed that Parkinson's disease is marked by excessive connectivity between the SCAN and the subcortex, a brain region involved in emotion, memory, and motor control. Across all four therapies examined in the study, treatments worked best when they reduced this overconnection. Restoring a more balanced relationship between these regions helped normalize activity in the brain circuit responsible for planning and coordinating actions.

""For decades, Parkinson's has been primarily associated with motor deficits and the basal ganglia,"" the part of the brain that controls muscle movements, Liu said. ""Our work shows that the disease is rooted in a much broader network dysfunction. The SCAN is hyperconnected to key regions associated with Parkinson's disease, and this abnormal wiring disrupts not only movement but also related cognitive and bodily functions.""

Precision Treatment Shows Early Promise

Building on these insights, the researchers developed a precision treatment system designed to target the SCAN without surgery and with millimeter-level accuracy. The approach uses transcranial magnetic stimulation, which delivers magnetic pulses to the brain through a device placed on the head. In a clinical trial, 18 patients who received SCAN-targeted stimulation showed a 56% response rate after two weeks. By comparison, only 22% of 18 patients who received stimulation to nearby brain regions improved, representing a 2.5-fold increase in effectiveness.

""With non-invasive treatments, we could start treating with neuromodulation much earlier than is currently done with DBS"" because they don't require brain surgery, Dosenbach said.

He noted that more foundational research is still needed to understand how different parts of the SCAN contribute to specific Parkinson's symptoms.

Looking ahead, Dosenbach plans to launch clinical trials with Turing Medical, a WashU Medicine startup he co-founded. These studies will test a non-invasive therapy that uses surface electrode strips placed over SCAN regions to address gait problems in people with Parkinson's disease. He also intends to explore low-intensity focused ultrasound as another non-invasive method for altering SCAN activity using acoustic energy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This popular diet was linked to a much lower stroke risk","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260209064310.htm","Mon, 09 Feb 2026 12:04:47 GMT","

Women who follow a Mediterranean-style eating pattern may face a lower risk of stroke, according to research published on February 4, 2026, in Neurology Open Access, a journal of the American Academy of Neurology. The study found a strong relationship between this diet and reduced stroke risk, though it does not show that the diet directly prevents strokes. Instead, it identifies an association between dietary habits and long-term health outcomes.

Researchers observed lower rates of stroke overall among women who most closely followed the Mediterranean diet. This included both ischemic strokes and hemorrhagic strokes. Ischemic strokes occur when blood flow to part of the brain is blocked and are the most common form of stroke. Hemorrhagic strokes happen when a blood vessel ruptures and causes bleeding in the brain.

What Defines the Mediterranean Diet

The Mediterranean diet centers on eating plenty of vegetables, fruits, legumes, and fish, along with healthy fats such as olive oil. It limits foods like dairy products, meat, and items high in saturated fatty acids.

""Our findings support the mounting evidence that a healthy diet is critical to stroke prevention,"" said study author Sophia S. Wang, PhD, of City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, California. ""We were especially interested to see that this finding applies to hemorrhagic stroke, as few large studies have looked at this type of stroke.""

How the Study Followed More Than 100,000 Women

The study included 105,614 women who had no history of stroke at the beginning of the research and an average age of 53. Each participant completed a detailed diet questionnaire at the start of the study. Researchers then assigned a score ranging from zero to nine based on how closely each person's diet matched Mediterranean diet guidelines.

Participants earned one point for consuming more than the population average of whole grain cereals, fruits, vegetables, legumes, olive oil, and fish, as well as for drinking a moderate amount of alcohol. They also earned a point for eating less red meat and dairy than average. About 30% of participants scored between six and nine -- the highest group. Another 13% scored between zero and two, placing them in the lowest group.

Stroke Outcomes Over 21 Years

Participants were monitored for an average of 21 years. During that period, researchers recorded 4,083 strokes, including 3,358 ischemic strokes and 725 hemorrhagic strokes. Among women in the highest diet score group, 1,058 ischemic strokes occurred, compared with 395 cases in the lowest group. For hemorrhagic stroke, 211 cases were reported in the highest group and 91 in the lowest group.

After accounting for other stroke risk factors such as smoking, physical activity, and high blood pressure, the differences remained significant. Women with the highest Mediterranean diet scores were 18% less likely to experience any stroke than those with the lowest scores. Their risk of ischemic stroke was 16% lower, and their risk of hemorrhagic stroke was 25% lower.

Why the Findings Matter and Study Limitations

""Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability, so it's exciting to think that improving our diets could lessen our risk for this devastating disease,"" said Wang. ""Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to help us understand the mechanisms behind them so we could identify new ways to prevent stroke.""

One limitation of the study is that dietary information was self reported, which means some participants may not have recalled their eating habits accurately.

The research was funded by the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke.

Baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is best known for its role in baking, brewing, and modern biotechnology. Yet this everyday microorganism may also offer insight into a far bigger question: how life might endure the extreme conditions found beyond Earth.

Researchers from the Department of Biochemistry (BC) at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), working with collaborators at the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in Ahmedabad, have discovered that yeast can survive environmental stresses similar to those on Mars. Their findings suggest that even simple life forms may be more resilient to extraterrestrial conditions than previously assumed.

Simulating Mars With Shock Waves and Toxic Soil

To test yeast survival, the research team subjected living cells to intense physical and chemical stress. The experiments included exposure to powerful shock waves comparable to those created by meteorite impacts on Mars, as well as perchlorate salts, which are toxic compounds known to exist in Martian soil.

The shock waves were generated using a High-Intensity Shock Tube for Astrochemistry (HISTA) located in Bhalamurugan Sivaraman's laboratory at PRL. These waves reached speeds of up to Mach 5.6. In addition, yeast cells were treated with 100 mM sodium perchlorate, either on its own or combined with shock wave exposure.

Overcoming Experimental Challenges

Setting up the experiments posed major technical difficulties. According to the researchers, exposing live yeast cells to shock waves at this intensity had never been done before.

""One of the biggest hurdles was setting up the HISTA tube to expose live yeast cells to shock waves -- something that has not been attempted before -- and then recovering yeast with minimum contamination for downstream experiments,"" explains lead author Riya Dhage, a project assistant in the lab of Purusharth I Rajyaguru, Associate Professor in BC.

How Yeast Survived Extreme Stress

Despite the harsh conditions, the yeast cells remained alive after exposure to shock waves, perchlorate salts, and even both stressors combined. While their growth slowed, survival rates remained high.

The researchers believe this resilience comes from the yeast's ability to form ribonucleoprotein (RNP) condensates. These are tiny structures without membranes that help cells protect and reorganize mRNA when under stress. Shock wave exposure caused yeast cells to form two types of RNP condensates known as stress granules and P-bodies. When exposed only to perchlorate salts, the cells formed P-bodies. Yeast strains that lacked the ability to create these structures were much less likely to survive.

Biomarkers for Life Under Alien Conditions

The findings suggest that RNP condensates could serve as biomarkers, or biological indicators, of cellular stress in extraterrestrial environments. This provides scientists with a potential tool for identifying how life responds to extreme conditions beyond Earth.

""What makes this work unique is the integration of shock wave physics and chemical biology with molecular cell biology to probe how life might cope with such Mars-like stressors,"" says Dhage.

Implications for Astrobiology and Space Exploration

The study highlights baker's yeast as a powerful model organism for India's growing astrobiology research efforts. By examining how yeast reorganizes its RNA and proteins when exposed to mechanical and chemical stress, scientists can gain valuable insight into how life forms might survive on other planets.

These insights may also help guide the development of biological systems designed to withstand extreme environments in space.

""We were surprised to observe yeast surviving the Mars-like stress conditions that we used in our experiments,"" says Rajyaguru, the corresponding author of the study. ""We hope that this study will galvanize efforts to have yeast on board in future space explorations.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Forests are changing fast and scientists are deeply concerned","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260208233836.htm","Mon, 09 Feb 2026 07:19:48 GMT","

Trees are essential to life on Earth. They absorb and store CO2, support animals, fungi, and insects, hold soil in place, manage water cycles, and provide people with vital resources such as wood, food, and cooling shade during hot weather.

Despite their importance, forests around the world are undergoing a major shift. New research shows that many forest ecosystems are becoming more uniform, losing biodiversity, and growing less resilient. These findings come from a large international study published in the journal Nature Plants.

By examining more than 31,000 tree species across the globe, scientists were able to map how forests are likely to change in the coming decades. Their analysis focused on shifts in species makeup, long-term stability, and how forests function as ecosystems.

Forests Are Shifting Toward Fast Growing Species

The study found that fast-growing tree species are becoming increasingly dominant. At the same time, slower-growing trees with specialized traits face a growing risk of decline or extinction.

Jens-Christian Svenning, Professor and Director of the Danish National Research Foundation's Center for Ecological Dynamics in a Novel Biosphere (ECONOVO) at the Department of Biology, Aarhus University, and a senior author of the study, says this trend is deeply concerning.

He points especially to the danger faced by tree species that exist only in small, isolated regions of the world.

""We are talking about highly unique species, especially concentrated in tropical and subtropical regions, where biodiversity is high and ecosystems are tightly interconnected. When specialized, native species disappear, they leave gaps in ecosystems that alien species rarely fill, even if those species are fast-growing and highly dispersive,"" says Jens-Christian Svenning.

The Trees That Support Forest Stability Are at Risk

The species under the greatest threat are slow-growing trees that thrive in stable environments. According to Svenning, these trees often have thick leaves, dense wood, and long lifespans, and they are especially common in moist tropical and subtropical forests.

""They form the backbone of forest ecosystems and contribute to stability, carbon storage, and resilience to change,"" says Jens-Christian Svenning.

If climate change and forest exploitation continue at current levels, forests are likely to favor fast-growing trees with lighter leaves and lower wood density. These traits allow rapid growth over short periods. Common examples include species of acacia, eucalyptus, poplar, and pine.

""Although these species establish and grow well, they are more vulnerable to drought, storms, pests, and climatic shocks. This makes forests less stable and less effective at storing carbon over the long term,"" says Jens-Christian Svenning.

Why Non Native Trees Are Spreading

The research also highlights the growing role of naturalized tree species, meaning trees that originated elsewhere but now grow wild in new regions. Nearly 41 percent of these species share traits like rapid growth and small leaves, which help them survive in disturbed environments.

However, Svenning notes that these trees rarely replace the ecological roles of native species.

""Moreover, in landscapes affected by today's and tomorrow's disturbances, naturalized species can make it even harder for native trees to survive, because competition for light, water, and nutrients intensifies,"" he adds.

Tropical Forests Face the Greatest Losses

The study shows that tropical and subtropical regions are likely to experience the most severe impacts from forest homogenization. These areas are expected to see the largest increases in tree species endangerment.

""This is where many slow-growing tree species with naturally small ranges occur. Because they are confined to very limited areas, these species are especially vulnerable and risk disappearing entirely if their habitats are destroyed or taken over by fast-growing species,"" explains the study's first author, young professor Wen-Yong Guo from the School of Ecological and Environmental Sciences, East China Normal University, Shanghai.

Guo also notes that fast-growing and naturalized species are expected to continue spreading worldwide as environmental disturbances increase.

""At the same time, we forecast rising number of naturalized and fast-growing tree species adapted to increasing disturbance throughout the world. Hence, in the colder parts of the Northern Hemisphere, the likely dominant dynamic is the invasion of such species,"" says Wen-Yong Guo.

Human Activity Is Driving Forest Change

According to the researchers, human actions are the main force behind these changes in forest composition.

""Human-driven climate change, deforestation for infrastructure, intensive forestry, logging, and global trade in tree species all play a role. Fast-growing trees are often actively promoted because they produce timber or biomass quickly. But ecologically, they are often fragile and more prone to disease,"" explains Wen-Yong Guo.

Why Forest Management Needs to Change

Using future modeling scenarios, the researchers examined how tree species are likely to spread or decline over time. Their results show that naturalized species already present in forests are expected to become even more dominant in the decades ahead.

This makes protecting slow-growing tree species increasingly urgent, says Jens-Christian Svenning. He emphasizes the need for forest management strategies that actively support these species and prioritize ecosystem restoration.

""When establishing new forests, far more emphasis should be placed on slow-growing and rare tree species. This would make forests more diverse and resilient. These species should also be actively promoted in conservation and restoration efforts, where they often interact positively with the recovery of richer communities of large animals, which themselves are also important for future ecosystem functioning,"" concludes Jens-Christian Svenning.

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-bound tumor peptides can be routinely isolated from cancer samples and identified using mass spectrometry (MS). However, MS approaches can be stochastic or rely on spectral libraries, which are not customarily available for individual-specific peptides, thus limiting the ability to discover novel peptides. Here, we introduce Pepyrus, which generates user-defined, individual-specific or disease-specific peptide libraries in Escherichia coli to improve the sensitivity and confidence of MS peptide identification, including lowly abundant neoantigens. Using Pepyrus-generated peptide libraries paired with an HLA-specific data-independent acquisition strategy, we recover >75% of the expected sequences per single injection for libraries of >10,000 peptides and identify 0.1 fmol of spiked-in peptides in a complex background. We apply Pepyrus to create personalized libraries, facilitating identification of clinically relevant HLA peptides, including several novel peptides from cell lines derived from persons with melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. Pepyrus enables identification of rare HLA-bound peptides and provides the ability to generate large training datasets to improve spectra, retention time and ion mobility prediction tools.

In this study, for the first time, Zn nanoparticles were created using the root peel of Beta vulgaris by a green method. Synthesized Zn nanoparticles have been characterized via UV–Vis spectroscopy, Zeta potential analysis, XRD, FTIR, TEM, and FESEM-EDX techniques. The synthesis of zinc-based nanoparticles was confirmed by spectroscopic techniques. UV-Vis analysis presented a broad absorption peak in the UV region, centered around 300 nm. Furthermore, a zeta potential of − 21.6 mV characterized the particles' negative surface charge and suggested moderate colloidal stability. The XRD pattern of Zn nanoparticles revealed crystalline structures, and FESEM and TEM images of Zn nanoparticles displayed a star-shaped morphology. The photocatalytic activity of NPs for the color degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) and Methylene Blue (MB) dyes has been investigated under UV light, and the results show 97% and 98% degradation, respectively. The antibacterial activity of the Zn nanoparticles was evaluated at a concentration of 1 mg/mL against the gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 1112 and clinical isolates), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC and clinical isolates), and gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli (ATCC and clinical isolates) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1 and S7). The cytotoxic effects of Zn nanoparticles were assessed over a concentration range of 7 to 500 µg/mL on both normal L929 fibroblast cells and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. After 24 h of incubation, the IC₅₀ value for the MCF-7 cell line was determined to be 284 µg/mL, while no significant cytotoxicity was observed on L929 cells. To our understanding, this is the initial report synthesizing star-shaped Zn nanoparticles utilizing B. vulgaris root peel as an eco-friendly reducing and stabilizing agent, highlighting their potential for environmental and biomedical applications.

HDAC inhibition shows promise in cancer treatment but pan-HDAC inhibitors cause gastrointestinal issues in 48% of patients. Understanding HDAC activation mechanisms is crucial to treating diverse diseases beyond cancer. Our study reveals that inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) and inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6 or phytic acid), enriched in vegan diets, play essential roles in activating the HDAC3 epigenetic axis and maintaining intestinal barrier integrity. IPMK binds to HDAC3 and drives InsP6 synthesis, which selectively activates HDAC3 at a 10 nM concentration by recruiting the DAD domain of its corepressor protein. IPMK deletion diminishes HDAC3 activation, leading to histone hyperacetylation and MMP gene transcription that compromise intestinal barrier integrity. InsP6 treatment is sufficient to rescue these effects. In inflammatory bowel disease, diminished IPMK levels exacerbate intestinal permeability, while oral InsP6 treatment mitigates leaky gut effects by restoring the HDAC3 epigenetic axis, highlighting the clinical significance of the IPMK-HDAC3 pathway and the therapeutic potential of phytic acid.

As natural hosts of avian influenza viruses, wild birds pose an increasing threat to public health. Here, using surveillance data from wild bird infections across the United States (2022-2025), we show that HPAI-H5 transmission exhibits strong interspecific variation, seasonality, and spatial heterogeneity linked to migratory flyways. Phylogeographic analysis reveals that viral genotypes evolve from early, limited transmission along single migratory routes to a nationwide dispersal pattern spanning multiple migratory flyways. Anseriformes exhibits the highest number of infections but the lowest transmission risk, whereas Strigiformes demonstrates the greatest transmission risk. The HPAI-H5 transmission in wild birds along migratory flyways exhibits significant spatial heterogeneity and is associated with bird migration. Meteorological conditions are correlated with outbreak timing and may inform early warning efforts; however, these relationships are nonlinear. These findings provide a foundation for risk assessment, early warning systems, and integrated management of avian influenza in wild bird populations.

Analysis of marine fish populations reveals that nonlinear dynamics are widespread and that the degree of nonlinearity is elevated by high temperature variation and for species with fast life histories. These findings support the nonlinear amplification hypothesis and challenge assumptions of stable equilibrium dynamics commonly used in ecology studies and in fisheries management.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Ferrari's New Jony Ive–Designed EV Is Swathed in Glass and Aluminum","https://www.wired.com/story/ferrari-ev-jony-ive-design/","Mon, 09 Feb 2026 13:00:00 GMT","

Despite Ferrari dramatically scaling back its EV plans at the end of 2025, it's no exaggeration to say that the reveal of the Italian automaker's first full electric car is going to be the automotive event of 2026.

While the exterior is still under wraps, Ferrari has unveiled the interior of its upcoming electric vehicle designed by LoveFrom, the creative firm of Apple's former chief designer, Jony Ive. It may not turn out quite like the Project Titan car Apple worked on for a decade then killed in 2024, but it sure does look like it has similar DNA.

“We are entering a new era in Ferrari,” the company's CEO Benedetto Vigna said at the unveiling, which took place last week at San Francisco's pyramid-shaped Transamerica building. Vigna also revealed that Ferrari has changed the EV's name. It is now officially called the Ferrari Luce—the Italian word for “light,” pronounced loo-chay.

“This is a project that will enlighten our future, our road ahead,” Vigna said.

The car previously had the nickname of Elettrica, and the change is apparently an effort to downplay the electrified elements in favor of focusing on more Ferrari-esque features. “There are many other things that are at the core of Ferrari Luce,” Vigna said. “Elettrica would have been a wrong name for our car.”

This interior uncloaking is the second of a three-part reveal process of the Luce. Ferrari shared details about its EV powertrain in October. Ferrari says a full disclosure of the exterior will come in May, but this latest showing was the first look at what Ive and his team at LoveFrom have created for those who sit inside the Luce.

At the event, Ive immediately contrasted the experience of designing the Luce with the 27 years he spent at Apple before leaving in 2019.

“Cars are very complicated,” Ive said. “But I hope that it will be obvious and clear the amount of care that has gone into every little piece.”

Utilizing an office space on an upper floor of the Transamerica pyramid, Ferrari and LoveFrom showed off several of the internal components that will be in the Luce. The team is certainly not ready to show us everything. We didn't see a stereo system, a glovebox, or even floor mats. We saw a front seat (which we weren't allowed to sit in) but not a back seat. We did get assurances from a Ferrari rep that the Luce would indeed have cup holders. Cup holders, after all, are mighty important.

We did get to see and touch the key elements of the cockpit: the steering wheel, the binnacle behind it with speed and odometer dials, a center-dash mounted display, and a center console with a glass gear shifter.

The Luce's steering wheel and binnacle.

The car comes to life when the key fob clicks into the console.

Oddly, none of these pieces were arranged inside an actual vehicle interior but were instead disembodied, separated, and spread out across one big room so people could wander through. One seat over here. A disassembled vent system by the far wall. It was the luxury car equivalent of a Marcel Duchamp exhibition, but instead of a urinal or galvanized-iron snow shovel (which, incidentally, went for $3 million last year), there was a steering wheel.

“Part of my grumpy belligerence now is I'm done working with assholes,” Ive said in his introduction. The line drew a laugh from the audience around him. “I'm so happy that we can just place creative excellence right at the center of what we're doing.”

Ive may wax self-deprecatingly about his salty nature, but when he started explaining the details of all the machined aluminum buttons he had ordered and approved over the course of five years, he was positively chipper. As we wandered through the exhibit, Ive happily responded to WIRED's questions on how things were working with Ferrari.

“It's an important brand,” Ive said. “I like the fact that they weren't lazy, like some other companies I know who just roll around in their success printing money.”

The center console.

If you're hip to Ive's style, the Luce's aesthetics will look familiar. Everything is presented in glass and brushed aluminum. Rounded corners are enforced with ruthless efficiency. The occasional small glass knob on the edge of screens evokes the Apple Watch's crown. The central control panel looks very much like an iPad. Even the sizzle-reel video Ferrari used to unveil the interior was edited like the booming product videos shown at iPhone launches or WWDC.

Ive says that the emphasis on physical buttons, each with a singular purpose, is to let the driver keep their eyes on the road and off the screen. “When you look at this, you are not wondering, ‘How many layers deep am I going to have to go to find something to make my bottom warm?'” he said.

“You don't touch anything but aluminum, glass, or leather,” multiple Ferrari employees said multiple times over the event. (The only bits of plastic they owned up to were a couple of gears in the control panel.)

The result is a truly tactile experience. Everything feels satisfyingly clicky or twisty. The aluminum buttons have, unsurprisingly, an incredible feel. The glass knobs were similarly smooth. We were particularly taken with the air vents, which have aluminum shields that flip around when you twist them open and closed. We fiddled with these over and over until the Ferrari people had to come tell us it was time to leave the room.

Ferrari's glass partner is Corning, the company whose Gorilla Glass has been used on every iPhone model. Corning says there are more than 40 glass parts in the Luce, including buttons, screens, and even the casing of the center console and gear-shift knob.

Ive calls glass a “truthful material.” Compared to a more standard plastic option, glass certainly feels more premium as a knob or gear shifter. But will it shatter in an instant if you get in a wreck? Hopefully not, as Corning says its technicians have done countless crash tests to make sure this version of Gorilla Glass is safe enough.

The steering wheel has the signature three-spoke design Ferrari is famous for. It is almost a circle but has a squished bottom that gives the wheel a shape that evokes a dumpling (or a flat tire). The wheel has a leather grip all the way around, of course, but clicky aluminum buttons right by your fingers let you signal or change music tracks and volume.

Behind the steering wheel is the binnacle, the console where the odometer, speedometer, and other indicators are placed. Taken by itself, the screen looks like a large iPhone in landscape mode with three Apple Watches positioned in the center. Convex lenses with a parallax effect magnify the circular OLED screens supplied by Samsung, which Ferrari has partnered with for the display tech. Additional icons appear in the top-right corner to indicate things like road conditions.

Though the binnacle is dominated by screens, very select bits are entirely analog. Namely, the needles of the speedometer and odometer, which are made of aluminum and polycarbonates. When the car is off, the dials' screens go dark and the needles seem to float in a black void. When the screens come on, they light up the needles as well, making them glow.

Tactile buttons line the bottom of the display, and an aluminum bar serves as a palm rest as well as a handle to reposition the screen.

The dials have digital screens behind analog needles.

To the right of the wheel sits a control panel display, a rectangular screen with smooth curved edges and almost no bezel. In other words, iPad shaped. However, the screen is mounted on a ball-and-socket joint and so can be moved around in a manner that brings to mind another relic of Ive's tenure in Cupertino, the iMac G4.

This screen again is a Samsung OLED, this time a touchscreen. The panel tells you lots of information unique to EVs, such as battery life and which wheels are using the most power.

The idea of the panel being movable is so that the person riding shotgun, instead of the driver, can control the stuff onscreen. Ive pointed out that when the screen is in its neutral position, the driver can rest their palm on the aluminum handle for easier access to the tactile switches and buttons without needing to look directly at the panel.

In the top-right corner of this panel is a cutout for a clock. The background of this clock is digital, so it can be changed to become a stopwatch or compass. The analog hands then move depending on which setting you choose.

Yes, the Luce's key fob looks like a miniature iPhone. It has a glass back, with a Ferrari logo surrounded by yellow E Ink. That digital ink comes into play when you turn the car on.

To demonstrate, Ive fitted the fob into a slot on the center console, where it snapped in magnetically. When Ive pushed it down, the yellow E Ink on the fob dimmed, and the glass knob of the gear shifter beside it lit up with a yellow gleam. The Ferrari logo blinks on, and the dials on the dash spring to attention. It was as if that signature yellow pigment was a serum being injected into the car's body, awakening it from slumber.

“You have this sense that it is really bringing life to the rest of the system,” Ive said.

Corning says the shifter knob has had 13,000 holes, each half the width of a human hair, laser-blasted throughout the glass so that the light can properly diffuse through it for just this purpose.

The front seat. (There is also a back seat, which we didn't see.)

After the main event, our scrum of journalists walked a couple of blocks from the Transamerica building to LoveFrom's headquarters. LoveFrom cofounder Marc Newson and some Ferrari reps were there, but most of the questions over the half hour that followed were directed at Ive. He rumbled out classic Ive-isms in his gentle baritone, such as, “If you can't use something, it's ugly” and “I love learning more than I love being right.”

However, this focus on Ive—plus the multiple echoes to Apple products past and present within the Luce—led to a nagging realization that perhaps this first EV from Ferrari is the closest we will ever get to seeing what the Cupertino company might have produced had its Project Titan ever made it out into the wild.

Ferrari knew exactly what it was buying by bringing in Ive and his team, and he has delivered. The goal of LoveFrom's efforts with the car company is to leave users with a tactile, visceral feeling that they are interacting with something real. Yet this also feels strangely incongruous coming from the man who helped build an empire off the back of beautiful slabs of glass on which everyone now spends all day doomscrolling. (The man is also, of course, designing OpenAI's upcoming physical hardware project that will provide an interface for its chatbot.)

To his credit, Ive seemed to recognize this incongruity and even gestured at some sort of want for atonement for the societal impact of the (very good) designs of his past.

“We've become more and more isolated in our digital worlds,” Ive said. “There is a growing desire to not be isolated, disconnected, whether it's from each other or the real physical world.”

“Every bone in my body tells me some of the things that we've learned, some of the things that I think we've discovered, I'm hoping will have a much broader relevance and implication of value to a broader set of products,” Ive said.

Maybe, someday, connecting with reality will be more easily attainable for everyone and not just those lucky enough to sit inside a Ferrari EV.

Over 160 companies in New York state have filed notices of mass layoffs since last March. None—in a group that includes Amazon, Goldman Sachs, and other employers that are adopting AI tools—attributed their workforce cuts in those filings to “technological innovation or automation.”

That option was added 11 months ago to a required question on paperwork that businesses with 50 or more employees must file with the state to notify of sizable job losses. New York's Department of Labor told WIRED that, as of the end of January, no employer had marked tech as the reason for their workforce reduction.

Over the past couple of years, many companies have celebrated offloading repetitive tasks such as customer service, sales, and accounting to AI systems. But saying that they are dumping human workers in favor of AI agents or robots can risk reputational harm. And economists face challenges tracing layoffs to tech advancements because companies can take decades to fully reorganize around new ways of working.

Enter New York governor Kathy Hochul. To get a better handle on the current reality, she ordered the Department of Labor to begin asking whether AI had been the impetus for layoffs. New York became the first state with an AI option, according to legal experts.

New York businesses can select multiple reasons among a list of 17 in total that also includes “bankruptcy,” “merger,” “relocation,” and “other,” on required Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification, or WARN, filings. If any company were to select the tech and automation option, they would receive an additional question asking them to specify the technology taking over work, such as AI, robotics, or “software modernization.”

Over 750 notices spanning 162 employers and affecting nearly 28,300 workers have followed the rollout without AI coming up. The results suggest that companies may be dodging the AI question. Or it's a sign that workers need not yet fear anything more than the traditional drivers of layoffs.

Some of the filers include caterers and retailers whose staff haven't widely been linked to capable AI replacements. On the other hand, Goldman Sachs led the way with more than 4,100 workers affected by layoffs or location closures, according to New York records. Amazon was among the top 10 with 660 affected workers. Morgan Stanley, another AI adopter, reported 260 workers out of job.

Internally, Goldman Sachs linked its layoffs last year to AI's potential to unlock significant productivity gains. Amazon warned ahead of its latest waves of layoffs, which affected about 30,000 workers in total, that benefits from AI would lead to job cuts. An unnamed source told Bloomberg that a small portion of Morgan Stanley's layoffs reflected AI and automation use. The companies operate around the world, so it's possible that only employees outside of New York were pushed out in favor of AI.

Overall, nearly 55,000 US companies attributed job cuts to adoption of AI last year, according to an analysis of public statements by the job search firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

Still, none of these developments showing up in the unique New York data reinforces the challenge with answering the question on everyone's mind: “Is AI going to take my job?”

Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel says, “AI is not the reason behind the vast majority” of cuts and that instead the goal is “reducing layers, increasing ownership, and helping reduce bureaucracy.”

Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Morgan Stanley didn't respond to requests for comment.

WARN filings are intended to give state agencies advance notice of cuts, so that they can ramp up services to help people quickly find new jobs. Companies face $500 daily fines for noncompliance with filing requirements.

Kristin Devoe, a spokesperson for the governor, says the Department of Labor follows up with every employer to ensure the accuracy of filings. In the case of Amazon, for example, the company listed “economic” as the rationale for layoffs, according to Devoe. It explained to the department that employees hired during the pandemic to meet surges in online shopping were no longer needed.

“The data collected through WARN notices, including the reason for layoff, serves as a valuable indicator of shifts in the labor market,” Devoe says. “Gathering these early indicators allows the state to identify workforce trends and upskill workers who may need retraining to make their skills more compatible with today's changing economy.”

She added that it is crucial for employers to answer “questions in WARN frankly and honestly so New York State can support displaced workers to the greatest extent possible.”

One of the country's largest union groups, the New York State AFL-CIO, applauds Hochul for trying to capture data on AI-related layoffs. It suggests that additional rules and greater focus on the issue could help bring about meaningful information. “We must establish specific regulations that mandate employer accountability and transparency in AI deployment and ensure employers comply,” says Mario Cilento, the federation's president.

Last month, state lawmaker Harry Bronson, who chairs the Assembly Labor Committee, introduced two bills that could expand reporting of AI-fueled job loss. One would require businesses with more than 100 employees to file annual estimates with the state on the number of unfilled roles as a result of increasing use of AI, and how many employees worked more or less hours because of AI.

The other bill would resemble WARN procedures but apply to a wider set of businesses handing over jobs to computers. Notably, failure to report could impair a company's ability to get state grants and tax breaks—a new prod to gather data.

Erica Groshen, a labor economist at Cornell University, which is in New York, says employers will struggle with answering questions about the consequences of new tech. A better requirement, she says, would be for companies to share detailed data with labor agencies on the evolution of skills and occupations.

“Frankly, do we really care if someone is displaced by AI, or just the normal competitive marketplace?” Groshen asks. What lawmakers ought to do is “give people the information they need to make the right transitions.”

For half a century, the world's nuclear powers relied on an intricate and complex series of treaties that slowly and steadily reduced the number of nuclear weapons on the planet. Those treaties are gone now, and it doesn't appear that they'll be coming back anytime soon. As a stopgap measure, researchers and scientists are suggesting a bold and weird path forward: using a system of satellites and artificial intelligence to monitor the world's nukes.

“To be clear, this is plan B,” Matt Korda, an associate director at the Federation of American Scientists, tells WIRED. Korda has written a report at FAS that outlines a possible future for arms control in a world where all the old treaties have died. In Inspections Without Inspectors, Korda and coauthor Igor Morić describe a new way to monitor the world's nuclear weapons they call “cooperative technical means.” In short, satellites and other remote sensing technology would do the work that scientists and inspectors once did on the ground.

Korda says AI could help this process. “Something that artificial intelligence is good at is pattern recognition,” he says. “If you had a large enough and well-curated dataset, you could, in theory, train a model that's able to identify both minute changes at particular locations but also potentially identify individual weapon systems.”

New START, an Obama-era treaty that limited the amount of nuclear weapons the United States and Russia deployed, expired last week, on February 5. (Don't worry, the countries reportedly still plan to maintain the status quo—for now.) Both countries are spending billions to build new and different kinds of nuclear weapons. China is building new intercontinental ballistic missile silos. As America withdraws from the world stage, its nuclear vouchsafes mean less, and countries like South Korea are eyeing the bomb. Trust between nations is at an all-time low.

In this environment, Korda and Morić's pitch is to use existing infrastructure to negotiate and enforce new treaties. No country wants “on-site inspectors roaming around on their territory,” Korda says. So, failing that, the world's nuclear powers can use satellites and other remote sensors to monitor the world's nuclear weapons remotely. AI and machine-learning systems would then take that data, sort it, and turn it over for human review.

It's an imperfect proposal, but it's better than the literal nothing the world has now.

For decades, the US and Russia have worked to reduce the amount of nuclear weapons in the world. In 1985 there were more than 60,000 nukes. That number is down to just over 12,000. Eliminating roughly 50,000 nuclear weapons took decades of dedicated work from politicians, diplomats, and scientists. The death of New START represents the refutation of those decades of work. These on-site inspections fostered trust between Russia and the US and laid the groundwork for a drawdown of tensions during the Cold War. That era is over now, replaced by an age of acrimony and a renewed nuclear arms race.

“The idea we had in this paper was, what if there was a sort of middle ground between having no arms control and just spying, and having arms control with intrusive on-site inspections which may no longer be politically viable?” Korda says. ”What can we do remotely if the countries cooperate with each other to facilitate a remote verification regime?”

Korda and Morić's proposal is to use the web of existing satellites to monitor intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) silos, mobile rocket launchers, and plutonium pit production sites. One big hurdle is that a good implementation of a remotely enforced treaty regime would require a certain level of cooperation. The nuclear powers would still need to agree to participate.

“They could transmit a message saying, ‘Hey, for the purposes of verifying this arms control treaty, we want you to open up silo hatch X on this day, at this specific time, because that's when our satellite is going to be flying over,'” Korda says. “And so that enables you to have this sort of mutual verification using technology that currently exists. It doesn't require anyone on-site, and it doesn't require you to do this persistent spying-style coverage, where you kind of just hope to catch glimpses of things. Instead, you're sort of working together to do a mutual verification.”

AI systems, verified by humans, could watch over it all. There are, of course, many problems with this. One is that competent AI systems need large datasets to be good at a trained task, and there's just not a lot of nuclear-weapon training data. “You have to build these bespoke datasets for each country,” Korda says. “Here's how Russia builds ICBM silos. Here's how the United States builds ICBM silos, that sort of thing. But even within countries, there can be differences.”

Sara Al-Sayed of the Union of Concerned Scientists has built one such dataset as part of a forthcoming study about the use of AI systems for arms control verification. The focus of her study is missiles, but she says that there's a lot more data a hypothetical AI-powered nuclear monitor would need to track. “You could think of all manners of things like missiles, the launchers, the bombers, the submarines, the sites of their production, the testing, the storage, the maintenance, and the dismantlement, including for any and all objects that are present at those sites,” she tells WIRED. “So you really need to think at that granular level of all the objects.”

And then there's the question of what, exactly, these AI systems would be doing. “What is the task?” Al-Sayed says. “Is it that you want to detect the presence or absence of an object? Classify what you're seeing? Or do you want to be identifying and tracking changes over time?”

In a hypothetical world where AI and remote sensing replaces on-site inspections, the parties agreeing to a new treaty regime would need to agree on how the AIs work and what they're tracking. That means new rounds of negotiation and new agreements at a time when countries aren't even honoring their old agreements.

Al-Sayed says that if we get to a place where countries are negotiating the specifics of AI arms control, then the world is already in trouble. “Why would you want to rely on an AI-based verification regime?” she says. “If you believe that automation is necessary, then you are in this paradigm where you feel like you need to catch every instance of your adversary or arms control treaty partner cheating. How is it that two parties or more could come together to even agree to negotiate an arms control agreement or treaty if the assumption is going to be that every single action could be suspicious?”

Al-Sayed's research into AI and arms control has also shown her that these systems are more complex than their boosters would have you believe. “There's an inherent stochasticity of these techniques, starting from the process of curating the data that you are going to use in order to train your model, then the labeling, and then the model itself, and the random performance of that model and its lack of explainability, and then the randomness that comes out,” she says

“How can we make the machines themselves trustworthy?” she asks.

At the moment, we can't. AI systems fail every day. They ship with massive security flaws, and the people who design them often can't explain how they work. The technology would be hard to hang a new nuclear arms control regime on.

But all treaty regimes are imperfect, and no country is going to allow a foreign power to tour its nuclear facilities these days. For Korda, Morić, and others at FAS, it's about triage—using satellites and imperfect AI systems to keep watch on the world's nuclear weapons could be a small bridge to a better world.

“A successor to New START is not going to put us on the path towards disarmament,” Korda says. “It's just going to help us prevent a real spiral into hundreds more additional nuclear weapons being deployed.”

There's been this hand-wave, this assumption, this yada yada at the core of our long-term space programs. If we can return astronauts to the moon, we'll find ice there. And if we find that ice in sufficient quantities, we'll break it down into hydrogen and oxygen, and yada yada, we'll use that fuel to fly deeper into the solar system, maybe even to Mars. And if we get to Mars, we'll find even more ice on the Red Planet. We'll mine that, combine it with the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and yada yada, we'll use that to fly the astronauts back.

It's an idea that's been around since the Apollo era and has been touted in recent years by the likes of former NASA administrator Bill Nelson and SpaceX's Elon Musk. But here's the thing: No one has ever successfully turned water into rocket fuel, not for a spaceship of any significant size. A startup called General Galactic, led by a pair of twentysomething engineers, is aiming to be the first.

This fall, General Galactic plans to fly an 1,100-pound satellite, using water to supply its only propellant in-orbit. If it works, it not only could start to solve the yada yada problem, it could make US satellites more maneuverable at a time when there's a growing possibility of a conflict in space.

“Everybody wants to go build a moon base or a Mars base or whatever. Who's going to pay for it? How does it actually work?” asks Halen Mattison, CEO of General Galactic. “Our vision is to go build a gas station on Mars,” he adds, “but also eventually build out the refueling network” in between.

That's the very, very long-term plan, at least. For starters, Mattison, a former SpaceX engineer, and his CTO, Luke Neise, a veteran of Varda Space, have purchased a spot on a Falcon 9 rocket launch. Scheduled liftoff is October or later in the fall.

There are, to broadly oversimplify, two main kinds of engines that you can use in your spacecraft. You can take a fuel like liquid methane, maybe combine it with an oxidizer, and burn it. That's called chemical propulsion, and every big rocket you've ever seen take off uses some variation of that method, because it provides a lot of thrust, even if it's not terribly efficient.

Or you can take a gas like xenon, zap it with electricity, and shoot it out of the spacecraft, either as an ionized gas or a plasma. That's called electric propulsion—again, I'm way oversimplifying. And “it's very, very low thrust. People jokingly like to call it a burp in space,” Mattison says. “But it lasts forever. The efficiency is crazy.” Enough burps over time can actually be quite effective. Electric propulsion is used to keep satellites in their proper orbit and to power space probes like Dawn, which NASA sent to explore the asteroid belt.

Water isn't ideal for either electrical or chemical propulsion. But it might be just good enough for both. Unlike, say, liquid methane, you don't need to worry about water accidentally blowing up your spacecraft or keeping it cooled at -260 degrees Fahrenheit or having it boil off when your satellite faces the sun.

General Galactic plans to demonstrate the two methods during its Trinity mission. For chemical propulsion, it'll use electrolysis to split the water into hydrogen and oxygen, then burn the hydrogen, with oxygen as the oxidizer. For the electrical propulsion system—this one's called a “Hall thruster”—it'll split the water, then apply enough electrical energy that the oxygen becomes a plasma. From there, you use a magnetic field to shape the plasma and shoot it out.

The idea is to show “we can provide both the long-efficiency maneuver but also sometimes folks need to get somewhere fast or respond really quickly to a dramatic event in the orbital environment,” says Neise, General Galactic's CTO. “Sometimes you need more than a burp in space.”

For example, Chinese and Russian satellites increasingly have been flying in close proximity to American ones. Finding a method for maneuvering away from those rivals in a hurry is something the US Space Force and others are extremely interested in.

The hope, Mattison says, is that “we can give you five or 10 times the mission Delta-V,” using the jargon for the total change in velocity and direction a spacecraft can make over time.

Mattison and Neise met in grad school at Stanford and began riffing on this water-based propellant idea. They started geeking out on the idea—and started their company—even as they worked day jobs for folks like Musk. They hoovered up research papers and called anyone they could who'd worked on similar systems. “We then take it to modeling software. We'll run the equations. We did a lot of Python scripts just looking at different mission cases,” Mattison says. Eventually, they got to a place “where we're like, ‘This is pretty different. This is kind of exciting.' And that's how we knew we had something that was worth putting real money behind.”

So far, Mattison and Neise have raised $10 million in venture capital, a relative pittance in the aerospace sector but more than enough for this mission.

Of course, there are reasons this has never been done before. Ionized oxygen interacts with everything, potentially corroding the electrical propulsion system. “It's not an easy element to work with,” says Ryan Conversano, a former Jet Propulsion Laboratory technologist who is serving as a consultant to General Galactic. “It makes material selection and design of the device or devices very, very challenging.”

As for the chemical propulsion system, it's not clear whether General Galactic's will be competitive enough with more traditional ones, once the added mass for the electrolysis system is added in.

“It could be a pretty, pretty clever way to provide thrust to a small satellite,” says Mark Lewis, CEO of the Purdue Applied Research Institute and the former chief scientist of the US Air Force. “But there are a lot of what-ifs.”

Lewis believes it's very much worth trying, though. If General Galactic can meet or top its expectations for this introductory effort, it could begin to be an answer to that yada yada at the core of tomorrow's missions to the moon and beyond.

On Sunday evening, during Bad Bunny's electrifying halftime performance at Super Bowl LX, a crowd of what appeared to be fewer than 200 people in an undisclosed location were treated to an alternative concert, “The All-American Halftime Show,” presented by the right-wing student organization Turning Point USA.

Conceived as culture-war counterprogramming for a show by a Puerto Rican mega-star who raps and sings in Spanish, and has been a vocal critic of ICE, the event featured four MAGA-aligned country stars and was headlined by Kid Rock, who made his entrance in jorts and trademark fedora. But for all the ideological outrage behind this challenge to globally popular Latin music, TPUSA's star-spangled jamboree wasn't particularly message-driven nor even provocative.

It streamed on platforms including Rumble, DailyWire+, and multiple YouTube channels. Blake Neff, producer of The Charlie Kirk Show, claimed there were over 5 million live viewers on the Turning Point USA YouTube stream; as of publication time, it has been viewed over 16 million times. Shortly before going live, TPUSA announced that it would not be able to air the special on X due to “licensing issues.”

Super Bowl LX, meanwhile, was expected to draw as many as 130 million viewers.

Though largely framed as a memorial to Charlie Kirk, the TPUSA founder killed in September during a campus talk, “The All-American Halftime Show” included no appearance by his widow, Erika Kirk, who has been on an extended media tour since her husband's death. President Trump did not comment directly on the concert, choosing instead to rant about Bad Bunny's performance.

“The Super Bowl Halftime Show is absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER!” Trump wrote on his digital platform, Truth Social. “It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn't represent our standards of Success, Creativity, or Excellence. Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young children that are watching from throughout the U.S.A., and all over the World.” These comments came amid renewed scrutiny of Trump's relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

The Democratic party's official X account screenshotted Trump's post about Bad Bunny, observing: “Guess he wasn't watching Kid Rock then.”

The livestream of the TPUSA event was preceded by a message from defense secretary Pete Hegseth, who said that the so-called Department of War was “proud to support” it. Viewers were also directed to a phone number they could call to “start or join a Turning Point USA chapter.” Comments on the stream were filled with remarks such as “Protect kids,” “No NFL on screen,” “GOD BLESS AMERICA,” and “JESUS.”

Country singer Brantley Gilbert kicked off the concert, heavy on pyrotechnic visual effects throughout, rapping into a microphone with brass knuckles on it and performing the hit “Dirt Road Anthem,” which he cowrote but was originally made famous by Jason Aldean in 2010. It features the line “Better watch out for the boys in blue,” a reference to trouble with police. The crowd, some wearing MAGA hats, then swayed to a couple of tunes by Gabby Barrett, who won the 2021 Female Artist of the Year award at the Academy of Country Music Awards.

Next came Lee Brice, who shouted out Kirk directly. “Charlie, he gave people microphones so they could say what was on their minds,” he declared before launching into a premiere performance of a new song called “Country Nowadays.” The lyrics included an allusion to gender politics. “I turn the TV on and sit and watch the evening news / Be told if I tell my own daughter that little boys ain't little girls / I'd be up the creek in hot water,” he sang. The chorus noted: “It ain't easy being country in this country nowadays.”

Kid Rock, 55, galvanized the audience as he poorly lip-synched to his raucous 1999 single “Bawitdaba,” which was followed by a treacly instrumental by a string duet. Afterward, Rock returned to the stage under his actual name, Robert Ritchie, with a cover of the mournful 2021 Cody Johnson song “Til You Can't,” to which he added an extra verse about the Bible and Jesus Christ.

The livestream concluded with more footage and recorded comments from Charlie Kirk, and a postscript stating that it was produced in “loving memory” of the TPUSA founder and CEO.

“The All-American Halftime Show” was hyped in advance by Trump administration figures including health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who filmed an ad for the event with Kid Rock, and on Sunday night, conservative pundits like Matt Walsh and Megyn Kelly touted it as a massive victory for conservatives. But Trump and other influencers preferred to simply attack Bad Bunny. “Illegal aliens and Latin hookers twerking at the Super Bowl,” Trump ally Laura Loomer posted on X. “This isn't White enough for me.”

At least one Super Bowl attendee, the professional sports gambler Amanda Vance (who has no apparent relationship to Vice President JD Vance), uploaded a video of herself watching the TPUSA show on her phone while Bad Bunny performed on the field at Levi's Stadium below her. “Watching the American halftime performance at the Super Bowl instead of Bad Bunny,” she captioned the clip on X. Vance received a number of mocking replies about how far back she was seated in the stadium.

After the show, Kid Rock's X account announced that his studio recording of “Til You Can't” would be available to stream or purchase at midnight, offering thanks to the original songwriters “for giving me there [sic] blessing to record and release it.”

The musician's lean into MAGA politics in recent years has delivered mixed results. An upcoming multiday concert he was to headline in South Carolina was canceled this month as other bands dropped out of what figured to be an extremely politicized event. The run-up to the TPUSA halftime show also collided with the release of millions of documents pertaining to criminal investigations of Epstein, a coincidence that led to the resurfacing of his lyrics about having sex with underage girls in the 2001 song “Cool, Daddy Cool.”

“Young ladies, young ladies,” Ritchie sings on the track. “I like 'em underage, see / Some say that's statutory / But I say it's mandatory.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Iran's Digital Surveillance Machine Is Almost Complete","https://www.wired.com/story/irans-digital-surveillance-machine-is-almost-complete/","Mon, 09 Feb 2026 11:00:00 GMT","

Over the past four weeks, the Iranian government completely shut down connections to the global internet while its forces killed thousands of anti-regime protesters around the country. The shutdown follows years of Tehran imposing connectivity filtering, digital curfews, and total blackouts as part of previous attempts to quell unrest. Over more than 15 years, the regime has developed technological and systemic mechanisms to fundamentally control connectivity in the country—including an internal Iranian intranet known as the National Information Network (NIN). But last month's shutdown, which is partially ongoing, has shed new light on the Iranian regime's control over internet connectivity and the reach of its digital surveillance capabilities.

Since it imposed an extensive, economically disruptive internet shutdown in 2019, researchers say, the Iranian regime has seemingly worked to refine its digital control playbook so the government can use the NIN to drastically limit and influence the flow of information to Iranians—and even selectively take down some internet access—without the problematic knock-on effects of plunging the entire country into digital darkness. Iran could be disconnected from the outside world, but the internal, state-controlled networks and infrastructure would keep operating.

Surprisingly, the recent shutdown, which started on January 8, took such a crude, blunt-force approach that it seemingly took down the NIN itself for multiple days. This drastic step raises serious questions, researchers say, about what will come next for Iranian connectivity, which is currently still extremely spotty and unstable around the country.

“For some reason, they did not go through their own playbook that has been refined for many years, and they did not execute the shutdown in a way where the NIN domestic network would continue to operate. They basically crippled everything,” a researcher from the internet freedom initiative Project Ainita told WIRED. (They requested anonymity to protect friends and relatives living in Iran.) “We don't know why it was done this way, but from our vantage point looking at the graphs and the connectivity readings, it looked like there was a panic. It looked very impulsive, and it was very reminiscent of what we saw years ago in previous shutdowns to just pull the plug.”

In addition to its economic impacts, near-total connectivity blackouts eliminate the digital activity that the government would otherwise surveil—leaving a blank spot in the government's intelligence about its citizens. But analysts say that the extent of the dragnet when connectivity is live is profound, particularly as the government further restricts the global internet and pushes the NIN.

Researchers from the US–based internet freedom and digital rights nonprofit Holistic Resilience released multiple reports on Monday analyzing the digital centralization, telecom infrastructure, and regulatory and legal mechanisms that allow the Iranian government to access virtually any data on the NIN including all communications.

The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps “either is a shareholder or a part owner of almost all telecom systems, which means that they have full control over how the information is being processed, and what type of information is being gathered,” says Holistic Resilience researcher Alex Moses. “There's been a systematic move to consolidate all of this data into a massive surveillance ecosystem. All of these individual systems together are part of a bigger picture of mass surveillance that's at an unprecedented level because of the total control from top to bottom of the infrastructure.”

The reports from Holistic Resilience spell out in detail how Iranian laws, regulations, technical infrastructure, interception systems, and other mechanisms are designed to assist in the surveillance of citizens and assert state control. These measures are often supported by companies, individuals, and state-affiliated hackers, the researchers found.

“CCTV networks, facial-recognition systems, applications designed to capture or log private user messages, and systems assessing citizens' lifestyle patterns and behavioral profiles collectively provide the Islamic Republic's security agencies with the means for broad and precise monitoring of the population,” the analysis says.

Put another way, Holistic Resilience's Mahdi Saremifar says simply, “They want to have a centralized system that monitors daily life—lifestyle surveillance.”

The NIN was developed as a core component of the Iranian regime's mechanisms for control, designed to provide Iran-specific apps, web services, and digital platforms to monitor Iranians constantly and control the information they can access while simultaneously making it much more difficult to get information out of the country to the international community. The NIN has an isolationist architecture that also prevents connections from outside Iran.

The first days of January's connectivity blackout were so severe, though, that the NIN itself was offline, disrupting government websites and domestic services. Multiple researchers told WIRED that the NIN, landline telephone networks, and even privileged-access SIM cards had no connectivity.

“There's been a lot of stuff in Iran, but I would say the blackout we're in now is without precedent in the country,” says Doug Madory, director of internet analysis at monitoring firm Kentik, “And I think it's arguably one of the biggest communications blackouts in history, not just Iran.”

Filterwatch, a project by internet freedom organization Miaan Group, says that as some connectivity has been restored, including international connections, it believes the Iranian regime is moving to a system of “whitelisting”—restricting internet access to certain organizations and websites or apps. Around the middle of January, the group notes, Iranian state-controlled media published a list of websites available on the NIN, which included Iranian search engines, maps, video services, and messaging apps.

“This architecture utilizes sophisticated service and customer segmentation to transform internet access from a public utility into a government-granted privilege, allowing the state to maintain critical business services while severing the public's connection to the global web,” Filterwatch explains.

Even as connectivity has been partially restored, researchers emphasize that the volatility of the digital landscape is still striking and leaves open the possibility that the current saga could precipitate permanent disconnection—or splintering—of Iran from the global internet.

For now, analyzing signals from the outside does not make the regime's intentions clear. “I'm seeing this kind of chaos in the traffic, and I don't know if that's the objective—they want chaos—or if this is the system not working correctly,” Kentik's Madory says. Maybe “they instituted this internet blocking system that is going haywire or maybe they wanted it to go to haywire. I can't tell, but it's nuts.”

Connectivity shutdowns, selective blocking, and other digital censorship can be appealing to repressive governments when regimes feel that a situation is getting out of control—both domestically and potentially in terms of optics on the global stage. But as researchers who are focused on Iran and other authoritarian governments have often noted, there are very real limitations of control via digital disconnection.

“When you absolutely disconnect everything, even people who may not want to end up coming to the streets, because they can't see what's happening from just sitting in their homes anymore,” another Project Ainita researcher told WIRED. “So in terms of controlling the situation, a bunch of these decisions don't make any sense.”

As Iranians slowly regain connectivity, though, they face the difficult reality that they are returning to a surveillance dragnet as intrusive and comprehensive as it has ever been.

In the technology world, we often talk about “inflection points” — those rare moments when a new product doesn't just improve on the past but renders it instantly prehistoric. We saw it when the iPhone hit the BlackBerry, and we're seeing it again right now in the automotive sector.

For years, I've argued that the transition from internal combustion engines (ICE) to electric vehicles (EVs) would be a messy, decade-long slog defined by compromise. After seeing what Volvo has done with the EX60, it's clear the slog is over. We have reached the cliff, and the ICE age is officially falling off it.

This week, let's discuss why the Volvo EX60 represents the point where electric vehicles stop requiring compromise — and internal combustion engines stop making practical sense. I'll close with my Product of the Week, a new AI tool that not only estimates how much longer you are going to live but also provides custom-tailored advice on how to extend your life.

To understand why this car matters, you must look at how it's changing the behavior of even the most loyal Volvo enthusiasts. My wife, Mary, hasn't exactly been a dedicated fan of the brand until relatively recently. When I took her to test-drive the XC60 Recharge several years ago, she said something to the effect that she wouldn't be caught dead in a Volvo. Then she saw and drove it and was sold. She is the primary driver of our 2021 XC60 Recharge — a fantastic plug-in hybrid (PHEV) that we once thought was the perfect “bridge” technology. It provided the safety of a gas backup and over 500 miles of combined range, while delivering the localized (18-mile electric-only range) efficiency of an electric motor.

In fact, Mary was so satisfied with the platform that she had a brand-new XC60 Recharge on order to replace her current lease. But then Volvo pulled the curtain back on the EX60. The reaction was instantaneous. She didn't just reconsider; she killed the XC60 order immediately.

Why? Because once you see the performance, range, and charging metrics of Volvo's new “born-electric” architecture, the idea of carrying around a heavy, complex, maintenance-prone gasoline engine “just in case” starts to look like carrying a wired rotary phone in your pocket in case the cell towers go down. It's no longer a safety net; it's an anchor.

The primary boogeyman of the EV movement has always been “range anxiety.” It's the fear of being stranded in the middle of a Nevada desert or a snowy pass in the Cascades with a dead battery and a long walk. Most U.S.-available EVs have hovered in the 250- to 300-mile range — fine for commuting, but stressful for the kind of long-haul trips an industry analyst or a busy family takes.

The Volvo EX60 P12 AWD variant effectively nukes this concern. With a massive 112kWh battery and a WLTP-rated range of up to 503 miles, it is one of the few vehicles sold in the U.S. that can compete with the “super-EVs” from China, such as NIO and Zeekr.

When you have 500 miles of range, you aren't looking for a charger every two hours. You're driving from Bend, Ore., where I live, to San Francisco, with maybe one stop — not because the car needs it, but because your bladder does. This isn't simply an incremental update; it's the threshold where an EV becomes objectively more convenient than a gas car.

Range is only half the battle. The other half is how long you're stuck at the “pump.” This is where the EX60's 800-volt architecture — a tech stack previously reserved for $100k+ super-sedans like the Porsche Taycan — changes the game.

The EX60 supports 400kW DC fast charging. In practical terms, that means you can add roughly 173 miles of range in just 10 minutes. Think about that. By the time you've walked into a rest stop, grabbed a coffee, and checked your email, the car has added enough juice to get you another two and a half hours down the road.

This is the final nail in the plug-in hybrid's coffin. The whole “value prop” of a PHEV was that you didn't have to wait to charge on long trips. But if the wait is only 10 minutes, the complexity of a dual-powertrain system (gas and electric) becomes a liability. PHEVs are notoriously less reliable than pure EVs or pure ICE cars because they have “two of everything” to break. With the EX60, the bridge has been crossed.

Visually, the EX60 is a masterclass in what Volvo calls “beauty by subtraction.” It utilizes mega casting — a manufacturing process where large sections of the car's body are cast from a single piece of aluminum. This reduces weight, increases structural rigidity, and — most importantly for consumers — results in a whisper-quiet cabin.

The interior is pure Scandinavian luxury. It moves away from the “screen-slapped-on-a-dash” look and toward a highly integrated, tactile environment. You have a 15-inch OLED center display that feels more like a high-end tablet than a car infotainment system.



A glimpse of Volvo's minimalist interior design, where software and displays take center stage.

But the real “brain” is HuginCore, Volvo's new core computing system. Powered by Nvidia and integrated with Google Gemini, the car not only takes voice commands but also understands context. If I tell the car “I'm feeling a bit tired,” it doesn't just show me nearby coffee shops; it can adjust the ambient lighting, firm up the suspension to keep me engaged, and suggest a 10-minute fast-charge stop where I can stretch my legs.

How does it stack up? This year is going to be a bloodbath for mid-sized luxury SUVs. We have the BMW iX3, the Audi Q6 e-tron, and the Mercedes GLC Electric all hitting the pavement.

While the BMW iX3 offers a slightly more “driver-centric” (read: busy) cockpit, the Volvo wins on pure logic and range. Most of the German competitors are still struggling to break the 400-mile EPA barrier.

Volvo, by leveraging Geely's global supply chain and the new SPA3 platform, is delivering Chinese-level battery performance in a package that actually meets Western safety and aesthetic standards.

We are also seeing a massive shift in the U.S. market. For years, we've looked at the 600-mile range EVs in China with envy. The EX60 is the first sign that the range gap is closing. If you're a domestic manufacturer still planning to launch a 280-mile SUV in 2027, you're already dead in the water.

We are witnessing the end of internal combustion engines' viability. When a car like the EX60 can out-accelerate a sports car (0-60 in 3.9 seconds for the P12), out-range most gas SUVs, and charge in the time it takes to eat a sandwich, the “pro-gas” arguments evaporate.

Through the second half of this decade, expect these metrics to become increasingly aggressive. We are moving toward “megawatt” charging and solid-state batteries that will make a 600 or 700-mile range the new standard. At that point, buying a gasoline car will be a hobbyist's choice, much like owning a horse or a manual typewriter.

The Volvo EX60 isn't just a new car; it's a declaration. By delivering 500 miles of range and 10-minute charging, Volvo has effectively bypassed the “transitional” phase of the EV market. It has made the plug-in hybrid look like a relic and has brought the performance of the high-end Chinese EV market to American shores.

If my wife's immediate pivot from the XC60 to the EX-series is any indication, the consumer has already made their choice. The future isn't coming; it's parked in the driveway.



There is an old saying that “what gets measured gets managed,” but when it comes to our own health, most of us are flying blind. We wait until something breaks before we visit a doctor, and even then, the advice is often generic.

That is why I am fascinated by Death Clock and its new offering, Life Lab. By taking the morbid curiosity of a “death date” and turning it into a proactive, AI-driven management system, they are democratizing the kind of high-end longevity care usually reserved for the billionaire class.



Data-driven longevity tools are turning life expectancy into something measurable, modeled, and managed.

The experience starts with a 29-question assessment that uses clinical-grade AI to estimate a projected lifespan based on current data. But the real “Product of the Week” magic is Life Lab, an internal tool designed to act as a 24/7 private longevity doctor. It allows you to centralize your health data — everything from wearable metrics to uploaded medical records, creating a comprehensive biomarker report.

What makes Life Lab stand out is how it uses AI to bridge the gap between your current projected death date and your “potential” date. This isn't just a static report; it is a living system. The AI, trained on over 1,200 longevity studies, builds a “clinical offensive” against what Peter Attia calls the “Four Horsemen”: heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and dementia.

By gamifying life expectancy, the service encourages you to feed it more data. The more it knows, the more accurate the estimate becomes, and the more tailored the advice feels. It provides specific, evidence-based recommendations on diet, supplements, and screenings you should request from your doctor. This is a far cry from the “eat more kale” advice we usually get; it is a data-driven roadmap for your specific biology.

For those of us in the U.S., the service gets even more serious with integrated blood testing. Depending on your subscription — $99, $199, or $299 per year — you get comprehensive lab work through partners like Labcorp and Quest. This latest update introduces Blood-Based Biological Age, allowing you to see if your body is aging faster or slower than the calendar suggests.

Having this kind of 24/7 AI concierge means you aren't waiting for an annual physical to catch a problem. You are managing your health in real time. If your inflammation markers are elevated or your glucose is rising, the AI identifies the issue and recommends an immediate course of action.

Death Clock's Life Lab is more than just a provocative app; it's a peek into the future of Medicine 3.0. By combining AI's ability to parse massive datasets with personalized biological testing, it gives us the tools to actually extend our lives rather than just watch the clock run out. If you're serious about longevity (trust me, the older you get, the more you care about your expiration date) and like the idea of a private doctor in your pocket, this is a must-try and my Product of the Week.

As millions of users — including large numbers of young people — increasingly turn to AI chatbots as their first-line “counselors” and confidants, Seattle-based startup mpathic is stepping in to ensure those digital agents don't provide dangerous advice when it matters most.

The company, founded in 2021 in a bid to bring more empathy to corporate communication, announced Monday that it is expanding to support foundational model developers and LLM-powered application teams.

The goal is to bring mpathic's software to a broader set of AI developers and enterprise partners as AI becomes more of an interface for mental health and medical support.

“We are essentially producing eval sets or training data sets to make models more safe for vulnerable users, like kids or people with mental health problems, people in crisis,” said mpathic co-founder and CEO Grin Lord, a board-certified psychologist and NLP researcher.

The startup is drawing on its years of work in clinical trials and hospital settings, helping AI teams stress-test model behavior before deployment, evaluate responses, and monitor live interactions with safeguards that can flag, redirect, or intervene when needed.

“It's kind of similar to people that create synthetic data for visual AI,” Lord said. “It's not every day that a child is going to run in front of a Waymo, but we can simulate that 10,000 ways with synthetic data. That's basically what we're doing, but from a psychological angle with language.”

In one early engagement, mpathic said its clinician-led program helped a model builder slash undesired or dangerous responses by more than 70%.

To fuel its expansion, mpathic raised an additional $15 million in 2025, led by Foundry VC. The company says the move toward foundational safety resulted in 5X quarter-over-quarter growth at the end of last year.

While Mpathic got its start building software to analyze conversations happening in corporate texts, emails, audio calls, and more, it has been developing models for high-risk clinical situations since 2021. Today, the scale of the startup's “human-in-the-loop” infrastructure includes a global network of thousands of licensed clinical experts. It is onboarding hundreds more weekly to keep pace with demand.

“It's a lot different company than it was even a few quarters ago,” Lord said.

Lord, a finalist for Startup CEO of the Year at the 2023 GeekWire Awards, calls herself a “techno optimist” and “realist” when it comes to AI, adding that she possesses a “radical acceptance” of the technology's usefulness. 

“It doesn't surprise me at all that if there's something that's available 24/7, that acts like a therapist, you're going to talk to it and use it. And that could be better than nothing,” she said. “I think the potential for this technology to have really positive impact is super high. I think we can train both humans and AI to listen accurately and well and not create harm.”

Without naming specific companies or models, Mpathic confirmed it is working with leading foundational AI model developers serving tens of millions of users. The startup also has clinical partners including Panasonic WELL, Seattle Children's Hospital, Transcend and others.

Mpathic, which employs roughly 34 people and is “hiring like wildfire,” according to Lord, has also grown its leadership team with the addition of chief marketing officer Rebekah Bastian (Zillow, OwnTrail, Glowforge); and chief science officer Alison Cerezo (American Psychological Association AI advisory member).

This one's for Paul.

We were waiting for Seahawks owner Jody Allen to pay homage to her brother, the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, when accepting the Lombardi Trophy on behalf of the team he saved and she preserved for their hometown. It didn't happen, so we'll say it here. 

Jody Allen is getting well-deserved recognition for her role as the franchise leader. As Jerry Brewer wrote in The Athletic, she's been an architect of the team's success, worthy of emulation by other owners in the league. 

“Jody's been fantastic,” Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald said after the win last night, pointing in particular to her role in guiding the team through last season.

What a remarkable family legacy, all the way around.

Up for sale? Ahead of the Super Bowl, reports circulated that the Seahawks would seek a buyer after this season. Adding a championship may not immediately increase the team's value, but as Sportico noted, “it certainly doesn't hurt.” We'll be watching any tech execs that might step up for the 12s as part of new ownership.

Seattle's big win in the Valley: Sure, it was a win over New England, but as the blue and green confetti rained down in the heart of Silicon Valley, it was hard not to see a symbolic victory for the Pacific Northwest over the rival tech hub, especially given the Hawks' trouncing of the 49ers in the playoffs. 

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was among those celebrating the victory and congratulating our hometown champs, which made us remember the time he once told a Seattle crowd, “Every time I go to the Valley, I'm thankful that I'm here.” 

Here are details on the victory parade, set for this Wednesday.

Alexa+ will try to kill you? OK, so maybe only in Chris Hemsworth's imagination, but the premise of Amazon's Alexa Super Bowl ad — that its next-gen AI assistant is “scary good” — seemed to emphasize the “scary” part a bit much. If you missed the upbeat resolution while grabbing another beverage from the fridge, you might have been left with the impression that Alexa is truly AI's killer app.

Maybe Ring is the real threat: In its own ad, the Amazon-owned security camera company said it just wants to help find lost pets via its “Search Party” feature that relies on AI to scan whatever's passing by your house, and tap into neighboring doorbell cams. 

Some viewers on social media shared that they were “creeped out” by the tech, and at least one privacy expert said tugging at our heart strings over a lost dog is a great way to make us willingly trade our personal data.

The “A.I. Bowl”? That's what some are calling Super Bowl LX after nearly a quarter of the commercials featured artificial intelligence. The New York Times' DealBook drew the historical parallel: the Crypto Bowl of 2022 (FTX went bankrupt by year's end) and the Dot-Com Bowl of 2000 (Pets.com and others shut down months after the tech bubble popped). 

The NYT pointed to comments by investment pro George Noble: “When an entire sector floods the most expensive advertising real estate on the planet, it's not a signal to buy.”

See our earlier roundup of Super Bowl tech ads, on the off chance you're not sick of all the AI commercials by now. 

Stop the presses: Especially given the high-tech focus of the ads, it was fun to see an old-school newspaper front page held up in the midst of the celebration. Of course, that was a gimmick by The Seattle Times, with the generic headline, “CHAMPS,” and a stock photo, in the spirit of the pre-printed hats and shirts anticipating a possible victory. 

The actual front-page headline this morning is “REDEMPTION!” — not exactly inspired — but the Sports section came through with an appropriate pun: ‘D'omination!

GeekWire's Kurt Schlosser and Grants Pass (Ore.) Daily Courier editor Scott Stoddard — both former Page One editors at the Seattle Post-Intelligencer — settled on “D-HAWKS” in a post-game text exchange about their dream headline.  

It's such a good feeling to know that the spirit of Mr. Rogers is still alive in the midst of everything going on in our world. Lady Gaga's rendition of “Won't You Be My Neighbor?” for Seattle-based Redfin/Rocket was one example. Later came an NFL ad with current and former players singing the just-as-classic “You Are Special” with kids. 

Both stood out as moments of calm in the commercial chaos.

YouTube on Monday introduced lower-priced YouTube TV plans that will allow subscribers to better tailor their plans to their own interests in areas like sports, news, and entertainment. The company said that it will offer more than 10 different plans to choose from, all priced below the $82.99 per month main YouTube TV plan that has access to more than 100 networks. The new plans will start rolling out this week.

While that main plan will not go away, the new plans will allow customers to pick what matters most and what they could do without in return for cost savings. 

Among the new plans are a $64.99 per month Sports plan, a Sports + News plan for $71.99 per month, a less expensive Entertainment plan for $54.99 per month, and a $69.99 per month News + Entertainment + Family plan, which includes kids' content.

The Sports plans include all major broadcasters, plus networks like FS1, NBC Sports Network, all of the ESPN networks, and ESPN Unlimited. This plan is $18 cheaper per month than the main plan.

YouTube TV's news channels include CNBC, Fox News, CNN, MS NOW, and Bloomberg, along with other national news channels. Combined with Sports, the package is priced $11 lower per month than the main YouTube TV plan.

The entertainment-only plan is $28 cheaper per month than the main plan, and includes major broadcasters as well as FX, Hallmark, Comedy Central, Bravo, Paramount, Food Network, and HGTV. Families with small kids can add other channels like Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, National Geographic, Cartoon Network, and PBS Kids for a bit more.

The company is also offering discounts for new subscribers, which could lower the price of certain plans further for either the first few months or the first year. Subscribers will continue to have access to YouTube TV's unlimited DVR, support for up to six family members on one account, multiview, and more.

Other add-ons like NFL Sunday Ticket + RedZone, HBO Max, and 4K Plus can also be purchased to customize plans further.

The company says all the new plans will roll out over the next several weeks. 

Customized packages are now not a new idea in streaming — à la carte options were a key part of the early streaming pioneer Sling TV's initial offering, for instance. This element of personalization was also one of the factors that was meant to make streaming a better alternative to traditional pay TV, where consumers often ended up paying for channels they didn't want.

But as streamers added more content, networks, and, in particular, sports programming, the cost of streaming inched back up to compete with cable and linear television. Live TV streamers like YouTube TV may have offered convenience and some savings over still more expensive cable, but it wasn't exactly affordable anymore.

These new packages hit the market at a time when consumer confidence is at its lowest in more than 11 years, due to fears about the labor market and higher prices, which have made consumers more cautious about their spending.

Gather AI, a startup that offers an AI platform for warehouse cameras and drones, has raised a $40 million Series B funding round led by Smith Point Capital. That's the VC firm founded by former Salesforce co-CEO Keith Block. 

The Gather team first met Smith Point a year ago at a logistics conference, and “it took Keith and his team five minutes to get what we're doing,” co-founder and CEO Sankalp Arora told TechCrunch. 

What Gather AI is doing is unusual. The three founders met as PhD students at Carnegie Mellon University, where they built one of the first autonomous helicopters and tested it on the FBI training grounds in Quantico. (Block is a trustee for CMU.) 

In 2017, the founders took what they learned about teaching helicopters to fly and land safely and launched Gather AI. Using off-the-shelf cameras placed on strategic moving equipment like forklifts, as well as off-the-shelf drones flying around the warehouse, the cameras watch on-the-floor operations and log what they find into the warehouse management systems.  

But the catch is, the AI isn't being random about what it scans. It is being “curious,” as Arora described it.

“My PhD work focused on how to make different kinds of flying robots curious,” he said. “So they're curious about boxes and bar codes and workflows.” 

In addition to barcodes, they look for lot codes, text, expiration dates, case counts, damages, occupancy, and other items. The idea is that they will discover and predict issues like low inventory, misplaced stock, and workflows that may cause safety issues. 

They also work in environments unfriendly to people, like freezers and cold storage. 

Because Gather's underlying tech was built years before the age of large language models, this is not the kind of AI that an LLM uses. 

“They're not end-to-end neural networks,” Arora explains. “They are classical Bayesian techniques, combined with neural networks.”  

AI vision Bayesian techniques use probability-base methods to teach computers how to interpret visual data. These systems allow the technology to learn by using data and prior knowledge to make decisions — meaning they don't suffer the hallucination problems of LLMs. 

Instead they “get curious,” as Arora put it, to gather information (hence the startup's name) and make a decision on the next action based on what they've learned. 

As old-school as that sounds, Gather AI is sitting at the edge of the next big thing in AI, sometimes called “embodied AI.” These are robots that interact with the real world, as opposed to an LLM interacting via computer chat or web app.  

To that end, in December, the startup won the 2025 Nebius Robotics award for Vision AI and Streaming Video Analytics. (Nebius is a Netherlands company that provides AI infrastructure.)

Gather currently employs about 60 people, Arora said, and customers include Kwik Trip, Axon, GEODIS, and NFI Industries. With this fresh funding, the startup has now raised $74 million total. Other investors include Bain Capital Ventures, XRC Ventures, and Hillman Investments.

Uber has agreed to acquire the delivery business of Turkey's Getir, once one of the biggest success stories of the country's startup ecosystem, the company announced on Monday.

The deal will see Uber paying $335 million at the outset to purchase Getir's food delivery business. The ride-hailing giant will also pay $100 million for a 15% stake in Getir's grocery, retail, and water delivery business, and said it would complete the acquisition of the division over the next few years.

Uber is buying the business from Getir's biggest shareholder, the Emirati sovereign wealth fund Mubadala. The investment firm was reportedly seeking to sell its stake in the company last year.

The deal comes after a turbulent few years for Getir, which once enjoyed a valuation of $12 billion, that saw the startup scale down its operations massively. The company launched to great traction in 2015, and invested aggressively to expand its operations in the U.S. and Europe, both organically and via acquisitions, especially during the pandemic.

But after the pandemic lockdowns eased, broader consumer demand for food and grocery delivery also wavered, and Getir chose to cut its losses in 2024, shutting shop and laying off thousands of staff in the U.S., U.K., and Europe in order to focus on business back home.

Nearly a year ago, the company went through a struggle for control over a restructuring plan proposed by Mubadala. The plan was opposed by one of Getir's co-founders, who eventually sued to fight the “illegal coup,” but a Dutch court rejected the founder's appeals.

The company has raised a total of $2.40 billion so far, according to PitchBook. Documents filed by Getir in court last year show the company valued its group assets at $374 million.

“This transaction reflects the strength of the business and the progress it has made, particularly over the last year,” Waleed Al Mokarrab Al Muhairi, deputy group CEO at Mubadala, said in a statement.

Uber said it would combine the new unit's services with Trendyol Go, a food and grocery delivery service in Turkey that the ride-hail giant bought for $700 million last May. Uber said Getir's food delivery business alone recorded gross bookings of more than $1 billion in 2025, up 50% from a year earlier.

The deal follows a strong showing by Uber's delivery business in the fourth quarter, reporting revenue of $4.89 billion, up 30% from a year earlier. The company said Europe, the Middle East, and Asia proved the fastest-growing regions for the business in 2026.

But... I want to see a photo! Or at least what it looks like in Google Earth, with a red arrow marking the furthest point.It feels like the site is setting you up for the big suspense of the longest line of sight... and then it's just a line on a 2D map.I think it would also really help if the maps themselves were at an angle in 3D with an exaggerated relief, with the line drawn in 3D, so you can get a sense of how it travels between two peaks.It seems like you've put a ton of effort into this project. I think with just a tiny bit more work on the page, you could really put the ""cherry on top"".And with those visualizations, get it picked up by a lot of major news outlets. This is a really fun story, the kind of stuff newspapers and magazines love to run. It's easily understandable, it's a cool new ""record"", it's a story of someone's perseverance paying off, and then you show a Google Earth image simulating the view as the payoff.

It feels like the site is setting you up for the big suspense of the longest line of sight... and then it's just a line on a 2D map.I think it would also really help if the maps themselves were at an angle in 3D with an exaggerated relief, with the line drawn in 3D, so you can get a sense of how it travels between two peaks.It seems like you've put a ton of effort into this project. I think with just a tiny bit more work on the page, you could really put the ""cherry on top"".And with those visualizations, get it picked up by a lot of major news outlets. This is a really fun story, the kind of stuff newspapers and magazines love to run. It's easily understandable, it's a cool new ""record"", it's a story of someone's perseverance paying off, and then you show a Google Earth image simulating the view as the payoff.

So you're saying a better title for the Colombian line of sight could be ""Pico Lagos del Congo to Pico Cristóbal Colón""? We can definitely change that.Thought I'm not sure what you mean about the coordinates being wrong? Are you saying that you should be able to see further from Pico Lagos del Congo?

Well the record for the longest photographed line of sight is in the same region as our #3 longest line, at 483km https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/66661-lon... So not far off. And I think that even takes advantage of some favourable refraction. So not only might it be possible to see the longest view. But there may even be longer lines if we were to take into account extreme cases of refraction. Which is certainly something we'd love to try.

> He monitored weather conditions closely to find the right window and right location. After a lot of travelling he arrived at Aksu village. The village wasn't accessible by car due to snow and ice so he hiked to the summit. After 10 hours of climbing, he stood on the summit with moonlight providing enough light to set up his equipment. At midnight, he recalls that the temperature was around -12°C with winds around 8 m/s. He remained there all night capturing panoramic photos. Before sunrise, the wind picked up to roughly 20-25 m/s and the battle of capturing his world record image began. He planned to capture the image at sunrise to improve contrast and whilst he is pleased with the final result, he is already making plans for his next record-breaking image.But still, that kinda confirms my observation about the pesky atmosphere: even with optimal weather conditions, he still needed the sun lighting up the sky behind the mountains just before sunrise, otherwise they would have blended in with the sky at the horizon...This also applies for much shorter distances: despite what the publicity photos suggest, you can't see the Alps from Munich most of the time (or only as slightly darker shapes on the horizon), although they're ""only"" ~ 75 km away. You need really good weather to see them clearly...

But if we instead quibble over the term ""photograph,"" I'd argue that a photograph of a silhouette of a mountain is absolutely a photograph of a mountain. Similarly, I'd argue that X-ray photography is indeed photography.

So using that, I would say that the longest line of sight in North America is from Mount Rainier, at 390km, looking North West into Canada: https://map.alltheviews.world/longest/-121.76853942871094_46...

That gives a longest in NZ of 365.3 km from Ruapehu, skirting past close by Tapuae-o-Uenuku (in the Inland Kaikoura Range) to a point on the Seaward Kaikoura Range near the peak of Manakau. Clicking on the actual Manakau peak also gives 365.3 km back to Ruapehu.I can't seem to find a peak to get a reverse path back to Mt Ranier. Everything I try gets stuck in the Olympic Peninsular. (I was there once ... 1998 or so ... a place called Hurricane Ridge IIRC)

So this is the NZ longest line right https://map.alltheviews.world/longest/173.61386108398438_-42...One thing to note about finding reverse lines, is that they're not truly mathematically identical because the observer always has a height of 1.65m and the destination is always some point at the surface, therefore 0.0m. It doesn't always make a difference, but it sometimes can.

Mountains can rise higher near equator because you have the least gravity there. The whole Earth bulges along the equator. But I don't think it's measurable.

reply

So that large lines of sight are near the equator on a north south axis (or symmetrically south north) is crazy because the high rates of curvature in that direction at those latitudes should give the shortest distance to the horizon on earth, making those lines of sight even that much more impressive!

It is not about highest point from centre of Earth. That's is related to equatorial bulge but irrelevant to the discussion.

There's two forms of interpolation going on here that I'm not sure you or Dr Dueschle are using. We interpolate a ""band of sight"" of single a degree for our azithmual projection, but uniquely we also rotate the DEM elevations around all the observers rather than the observer around to see all the elevations.The effects of the first can be lessened by lowering the band of sight such that we only process half a degree at a time so that we make sure we get more coverage further away. We plan on running some more experiments by rotating to cover more points.The algorithm is already fairly expensive to run against the whole world so we weren't particularly interested in that level of coverage for the full earth.For total viewshed area, our algorithm comes in at roughly a percent or so difference which was what we used as our benchmark for correctness.All this to say, no, we don't think you both are wrong, we've been looking at making ours more accurate. At a world scale that's quite computationally expensive, so we didn't use that methodology for our initial launch. We see our results as validation of yours, not as something we've disproved.Edit: grammar

I wonder how atmospheric refraction is handled in the calculations for the longest line of sight. Since it (a) strongly affects the line of sight, and (b) depends on temperature and weather, how is a static ""world record"" possible, or even defined? E.g. objects may appear 400m higher in 200km distance under typical conditions.https://hdersch.github.io/Viewing.html

reply

We actually have a plan to aggregate world runs together, so that one run as low refraction and a short observer, then another run with high refraction and tall observer. Then instead of rendering longest lines of sight as those singl triangles, we could render them as 2 triangles that represents the extremes of expected visibility.

That it's not taking into account human construction or distances of tens of meters?Presumably you can walk a little bit and climb on someone's roof to see the claimed 24.7 km. Assuming a sufficiently clear atmosphere, and that there isn't a tall office building in the way or something.

Next curious fact -- the two towers of the Golden Gate Bridge are perfectly vertical, but the top of one tower is 4.6 cm (1.8 inches) farther away from the other, compared to the bottom of the towers -- because there is a small angular tilt between the towers. Guess why ...Okay, it's because the towers are independently vertical with respect the center of the earth, are horizontally separated by 4,200 feet, and each tower is 746 feet tall. These dimensions assure that the towers have a distinct angle with respect to each other. It's a small difference, but it's not zero.I thought about these things (and many others) during my four-year solo around-the-world sail (https://arachnoid.com/sailbook/).

Certainly not.

Most people's desktop computers aren't much better. They are continuously used by others against the interests of the people who paid for them, sometimes explicitly keeping them from doing things they want or limiting what they can install.People are increasingly ignorant of how computers work in ways that were never possible when you had to understand them to use them.

They now have to beg a small number of companies for anything they want (including their own data on the cloud). We're heading toward a future where you'll need a submit to a retinal scan just to view a website.Computing today is more adversarial, restricted, opaque, centralized, controlled, and monitored than it has been in a very long time.

For example, say phones become more and more locked down and invasive. Technically you can choose not to have a phone, but how are you meant to function in today's society without a phone? Basically everything of importance assumes you have a phone. Technically you could make your own phone, I guess, but that's very difficult.I don't think you can reasonably make the argument that because technically everyone can make their own choices, we should be ok with whatever status quo in society.

I don't think we should be ok with the status quo, and I think complaining about issues can be a catalyst for change, but rather than just complain about the state of affairs, I'm pointing out that alternatives exist, so it's on us to enact change.TBH, I'm pessimistic about my words making a difference, but I want to promote independent/DIY mindset anyway. It's ironic that the frontier LLMs are proprietary platforms, yet they're enabling more independence to their users. Regardless, if everything goes to shit, we can still opt out and go back to the previous generation's lifestyle. No mobile phones and moving at the speed of snail mail doesn't sound all that bad, though I'd sure miss Google Maps.

Maybe they made us feel magic, but actual magic is the opposite of what I want computers to be. The “magic” for me was that computers were completely scrutable and reason-able, and that you could leverage your reasoning abilities to create interesting things with them, because they were (after some learning effort) scrutable. True magic, on the other hand, is inscrutable, it's a thing that escapes explanation, that can't be reasoned about. LLMs are more like that latter magic, and that's not what I seek in computers.> We're literally living in the 1980s fantasy where you could talk to your computer and it had a personality.I always preferred the Star-Trek-style ship computers that didn't exhibit personality, that were just neutral and matter-of-fact. Computers with personality tend to be exhausting and annoying. Please let me turn it off. Computers with personality can be entertaining characters in a story, but that doesn't mean I want them around me as the tools I have to use.

The fact that LLMs are based on a network of simple matrix multiplications doesn't change that. That's like saying that the human brain is based on simple physical field equations, and therefore its behavior is easy to understand.

Hostile operating systems. Take the effort to switch to Linux.Undocumented hardware, well there is far more open source hardware out there today and back in the day it was fun to reverse engineer hardware, now we just expect it to be open because we couldn't be bothered to put in the effort anymore.Effort gives me agency.

when someone invents a new scheduling algorithm or a new concurrent data structure, it's usually based on hunches and empirical results (benchmarks) too.  nobody sits down and mathematically proves their new linux scheduler is optimal before shipping it. they test it against representative workloads and see if there is uplift.we understand transformer architectures at the same theoretical level we understand most complex systems. we know the principles, we have solid intuitions about why certain things work, but the emergent behavior of any sufficiently complex system isn't fully predictable from first principles.that's true of operating systems, distributed databases, and most software above a certain complexity threshold.

That doesn't mean complex systems never behaved unexpectedly, but the engineering goal was explicit determinism wherever possible: predictable execution, bounded failure modes, reproducible debugging. That tradition carried through operating systems, compilers, finance software, avionics, etc.What is newer is our comfort with probabilistic or emergent systems, especially in AI/ML. LLMs are deterministic mathematically, but in practice they behave probabilistically from a user perspective, which makes them feel different from classical algorithms.So I'd frame it less as ""determinism is new"" and more as ""we're now building more systems where strict determinism isn't always the primary goal.""Going back to the original point, getting educated on LLMs will help you demystify some of the non-determinism but as I mentioned in a previous comment, even the people who literally built the LLMs get surprised by the behavior of their own software.

I agree, that it would be good. (It is one reason why I wanted to design a better computer, which would include full documentation about the hardware and the software (hopefully enough to make a compatible computer), as well as full source codes (which can help if some parts of the documentation are unclear, but also can be used to make your own modifications if needed).) (In some cases, we have some of this already, but not entirely. Not all hardware and software has the problems you list, although it is too common now. Making a better computer will not prevent such problematic things on other computers, and not entirely preventing such problems on the new computer design either, but it would help a bit, especially if it is actually designed good rather than badly.)

Plus 8 years was just an example, not the furthest back Go will support. I've just pulled a project I'd written against Go 1.0 (the literal first release of Golang). It's 16 years old now, uses C interop too (so not a trivial Go program), and I've not touched the code in the years since. It compiled without any issues.Go is one of the very few programming languages that has an official backwards compatibility guarantee. This does lead to some issues of its own (eg some implementations of new features have been somewhat less elegant because the Go team favoured an approach that didn't introduce changes to the existing syntax).

I think LLMs as a technology are pretty cool, much like crowdsourcing is. We finally have pretty good automatic natural language processing that scales to large corpora. That's big. Also, I think the state of the software industry that is mostly driving the development, deployment, and ownership of this technology is mostly doing uninspired and shitty things with it. I have some hope that better orgs and distributed communities will accomplish some cool and maybe even monumental things with them over time, but right now the field is bleak, not because the technology isn't impressive (although somehow despite how impressive it is it's still being oversold) but because silicon valley is full of rotten institutions with broken incentives, the same ones that brought us social media and subscriptions to software. My hope for the new world a technology will bring about will never rest with corporate aristocracy, but with the more thoughtful institutions and the distributed open source communities that actually build good shit for humanity, time and time again

The scary applications are the ones where it's not so easy to check correctness...

reply

As for things that can actually be incorrect, that has always been impossible, but we accept the human consensus to be a close enough approximation. With that, verifying 'correctness' to the degree that is possible is actually quite easy through validating it across many different LLMs trained on the human consensus. They will not all hallucinate identically. If convergence is found, then you have also found the human consensus. That doesn't prove correctness — we have never had a way to do that — but it is equivalent to how we have always dealt with establishing what we believe is correct.

Furthermore, even if we allow ""very useful"", that's a far cry from ""admitting a large number of uses"". The latter requires a search engine to properly map.Which they've been good at for a while. You could have googled ""word meaning admitting a large number of uses"" back in 2018 and gotten good answers.My point is, the tools you've linked to are useful/versatile, but it's not the thesaurus that makes them so useful, it's the digital query engine built on top of the thesaurus.

Frankly, I have my doubts about the utter efficiency of LLMs writing code unattended; it will take quite some time before whatever comes after the current crop learns to do that efficiently and reliably. (Check out how many years went between first image generation demos and today's SOTA.) But the vector is obvious: humans would have to speak a higher-level language to computers, and hand-coding Typescript is going to be as niche in 10 years as today is hand-coding assembly.This adds some kinds of fun, but also removes some other kinds of fun. There's a reason why people often pick something like PICO-8 to write games for fun, rather than something like Unreal Engine. So software development becomes harder because the developer has to work on more and more complex things, faster, and with fewer chances to study the moving parts to a comfortable depth.

LLMs were trained on public code libraries and unfortunately most pf that OSS code is garbage.There are ofcourse raisins there, but those are far in between.Top it off with hallucinations and suddenly you spend more time debugging messy AI code when you could write the same in a fraction of that time.The easier the task, the better job LLMs do, the harder the task the worse results you get.Source: working with those tools daily.Using your analogy:- by car it will be 30km uphill, coz of how the road is built- walking it will be 1km straight line

There have been wild technological developments but we've lost privacy and autonomy across basically all devices (excepting the people who deliberately choose to forego the most capable devices, and even then there are firmware blobs). We've got the facial recognition and tracking so many sci-fi dystopias have warned us to avoid.I'm having an easier time accomplishing more difficult technological tasks. But I lament what we have come to. I don't think we are in the Star Trek future and I imagined doing more drugs in a Neuromancer future. It's like a Snow Crash / 1984 corporate government collab out here, it kinda sucks.

I've been programming since 1998 when I was in elementary school.  I have the technical skills to write almost anything I want, from productivity applications to operating systems and compilers.  The vast availability of free, open source software tools helps a lot, and despite this year's RAM and SSD prices, hardware is far more capable today at comparatively lower prices than a decade ago and especially when I started programming in 1998.  My desktop computer is more capable than Google's original cluster from 1998.However, building businesses that can compete against Big Tech is an entirely different matter.  Competing against Big Tech means fighting moats, network effects, and intellectual property laws.  I can build an awesome mobile app, but when it's time for me to distribute it, I have to either deal with app stores unless I build for a niche platform.Yes, I agree that it's never been easier to build competing products due to the tools we have today.  However, Big Tech is even bigger today than it was in the past.

Look at how even the Posix ecosystem - once a vibrant cluster of a dozen different commercial and open source operating systems built around a shared open standard - has more or less collapsed into an ironclad monopoly because LXC became a killer app in every sense of the term. It's even starting to encroach on the last standing non-POSIX operating system, Windows, which now needs the ability to run Linux in a tightly integrated virtual machine to be viable for many commercial uses.

It's remarkable that people who think like this don't have the foresight to see that this technology is not a higher level of abstraction, but a replacement of human intellect. You may be working with it today, but whatever you're doing will eventually be done better by the same technology. This is just a transition period.Assuming, of course, that the people producing these tools can actually deliver what they're selling, which is very much uncertain. It doesn't change their end goal, however. Nor the fact that working with this new ""abstraction"" is the most mind numbing activity a person can do.

That's not a higher level of abstraction, it's having someone do the work for you while doing less and less of the thinking as well. Someone might resist that urge and consistently guide the model closely but that's probably not what the collective range of SWEs who use these models are doing and rapidly the ease of using these models and our natural reluctance to take on mental stress is likely to make sure that eventually everyone lets LLMs do most or all of the thinking for them. If things really go in that direction and spread, I foresee a collective dumbing down of the general population.

So, in a sense our ""craft"" no longer matters, but what really happens is that the repetitive know-how has become commoditized. We still need people to do creative work, but what is not clear is how many such people we will need. After all, at least in short term, most people build their career by perfecting procedural work because transferring the know-how and the underlying whys is very expensive to human. For the long term, though, I'm optimistic that engineers just get an amazing tool and will use it create more opportunities that demand more people.

And no, tests are not sufficient for that.Of course, all programs have bugs, but there's a qualitative difference between a program designed to be understood, and a program that is effectively a black box that was generated by an LLM.There's no reason to think that at some point, computers won't be able to do this well, but at the very least the current crop of LLMs don't seem to be there.> and now they can churn out millions of code easily.It's funny how we suddenly shifted from making fun of managers who think programmer's should be measured by the number of lines of code they generated, to praising LLMs for the same thing. Why did this happen? Because just like managers, programmers letting LLMs write the code aren't reading and don't understand the output, and therefore the only real measure they have for ""productivity"" is lines of code generated.Note that I'm not suggesting that using AI as a tool to aid in software development is a bad thing.

If you see your job as a ""thinking about what code to write (or not)"" monkey, then you're safe.

Offloading the LLM-safe stuff frees up your time to focus on the LLM-unsafe stuff (or just chill and enjoy the free time).

Humans rewire their mind to optimize it for the codebase, that is why new programmers takes a while to get up to speed in the codebase. LLM doesn't do that and until they do they need the entire thing in context.And the reason we can't do that today is that there isn't enough data in a single codebase to train an LLM to be smart about it, so first we need to solve the problem that LLM needs billions of examples to do a good job. That isn't on the horizon so we are probably safe for a while.

Because a junior developer doesn't stay a junior developer forever. The value of junior developers has never been the code they write. In fact, in my experience they're initially a net negative, as more senior developers take time to help them learn. But it's an investment, because they will grow into more senior developers.

While I think both sides have an argument on the eventual SWE career viability there is a problem. The downsides of hiring now (costs, uncertainity of work velocity, dry backlogs, etc) are certain; the risk of paying more later is not guaranteed and maybe not as big of an issue. Also training juniors doesn't always benefit the person paying.* If you think long term that we will need seniors again (industry stays same size or starts growing again) given the usual high ROI on software most can afford to defer that decision till later. Goes back to pre-AI calculus and SWE's were expensive then and people still payed for them.* If you think that the industry shrinks then its better to hold off so you get more out of your current staff, and you don't ""hire to fire"". Hopefully the industry on average shrinks in proportion to natural retirement of staff - I've seen this happen for example in local manufacturing where the plant lives but slowly winds down over time and as people retire they aren't replaced.

But I also have no idea how people are going to think about what code to write when they don't write code. Maybe this is all fine, is ok, but it does make me quite nervous!

LLMs benefit juniors, they do not replace them. Juniors can learn from LLMs just fine and will actually be more productive with them.When I was a junior my “LLM” was StackOverflow and the senior guy next to me (who no doubt was tired of my antics), but I would've loved to have an actual LLM - it would've handled all my stupid questions just fine and freed up senior time for the more architectural questions or those where I wasn't convinced by the LLM response. Also, at least in my case, I learnt a lot more from reading existing production code than writing it - LLMs don't change anything there.

I'm not against AI in itself, but the current implementation (read market) can eat my shiny metal … I got kids to feed and bills to pay. Yes AI was all about post scarcity. Hiring in our industry is already feeling the brunt of AI, where is the UBI? Where is our soft landing? I'm too old to learn XYZ skill if I get laid off, it will be life changing, and for what? For some rich person to be richer while simultaneously destroying the climate and my energy bill?I would push back, but I do not know how. Hope for the market to pop I guess.

I have a bridge to sell¹ to everyone who ever believed Sam Altman was serious about and ever cared about UBI. All his “career” was about himself, he couldn't give a rat's ass about anyone else. Only way he'd care about UBI is if that somehow would benefit him even more than the alternatives.¹ Not really. Unlike Sam, I'd feel bad about scamming anyone.

If you're not already retirement aged, how is age stopping you from learning a new skill? This sounds like learned ageism.

There are also mixed people on these forums in different regions, countries, work experiences, etc. For example software in most places in the world had an above average salary but not extremely high (i.e. many other white collar professions would pay similar/more). For those people where it is a standard skilled role it probably hits even harder now than say the ones with lots of stock who can retire early and enjoy the new toy that is AI.

reply

Virtually all other careers that offer similar compensation have an old boys club gatekeeping the profession, requiring you submit many years and hundreds of thousands of dollars before they will consider letting you in. That might pencil out as a reasonable investment when you are 14, but once you are mid-career you'll never get back what you put into it.Learning XYZ skill is something you can do at any age, and doing so will even get you an average paying job with ease. Learning the XYZ skill in the way that keeps the old boys happy is not a realistic option for someone who considers themselves old.

AI isn't what is driving us to slow hiring down in the US. There are other reasons I have brought up multiple times on HN.> I'm too old to learn XYZ skill if I get laid offSadly, you will have to.My dad is in his 60s and has been programming and soldering since ZX Spectrums and apple ][s roamed the earth, yet he still keeps abreast on the latest CNCF projects, prompt engineering, A2A, eBPF, and other modern stacks.Meanwhile I'm seeing people half his age flaming out and kvetching that spending some time further studying A2A, MCP, and other design patterns is insurmountable.Software Engineering is an ENGINEERING discipline. If you do not keep abreast on the changes happening in our industry, you will fall behind.And in fact, having years of experience is a net benefit because newer innovations themselves build on top of older fundamentals.For example, understanding Linux internals helps debug GPUs that communicate via Infiniband that are being used to train models that are being orchestrated via K8s and are operating on segmented networks.Our PortCos and I are not hiring you to be a code monkey writing pretty looking code.

I find it unsettling how many people in the comments say that they don't like writing code. Feels aliens to me. We went into this field for seemingly very different reasons.I do use LLMs and even these past two days I was doing vibe coding project which was noticeably faster to setup and get to its current state than if I wrote in myself. However I feel almost dirty by how little I understand the project. Sure, I know the overall structure, decisions and plan. But I didn't write any of it and I don't have deep understanding of the codebase which I usually have when working on codebase myself.

Honestly all the complaining about dying of a craft is just pathetic. In one of the jobs I worked, there were specific performance rubrics under ""Craft"" and those really annoyed me. Software / Code is just a tool to solve a problem.

reply

Calling it pathetic I think lacks empathy and perhaps an appreciation for what it might mean to other people outside the letters we type. Those letters, the languages we type, compilers that process them, and libraries that enable them were, at the end of the day, made by people.

I do feel a kind of personal loss in the sense that society is in the process of stopping to value or admire the design and coding skill I've cultivated since I was 6yo.  At the same time, I'm kind of thrilled that I can write a detailed readme.md and tell an agent to ""make it so"" and I can iterate to a utility program in 20 minutes instead of an hour.  When I feel a pit in my stomach is when that utility program uses some framework that I haven't learned, and don't need to because their code worked perfectly the first time. Surely that means I'm going to basically stop learning the details, as the details I've accumulated over my life quickly begin to not matter anymore.Honestly I'm planning to use AI to make a kick-ass retro development environment a la ""Sending Modern Languages Back to 1980s Game Programmers"" (https://prog21.dadgum.com/6.html) and spend my retirement having fun in it.

Not everyone has to become a programmer, people at the start of their careers can chooses paths other than programming if they're afraid of the (lack of) future prospects from AI. Where did people work before the ZIRP boom? Those industries are still around. Plenty of STEM related jobs besides programing.

Shell scripting was something that I failed to get any real traction with for decades, and since letting AI help me write dozens of shell scripts, I find that I have gained a basic level of proficiency. (i.e. I found that I had become relatively fluent in writing them even without assistance, which surprised me!)It ties in with the Input Hypothesis of language acquisition. More volume in = more opportunities for brain to find the patterns, and learn them naturally.That doesn't work for the approach where you don't look at the code at all, though. Which seems to depend on your goals for the project.For the boids thing, the math isn't something I enjoy doing manually anyway (I've done that for the last 15 years and it always felt like pulling teeth), so the main learning I'd get there would be at the applied level... How to tweak the Perlin noise to get the result I want, rather than how or why it works in the first place.

Which seems to depend on your goals for the project.For the boids thing, the math isn't something I enjoy doing manually anyway (I've done that for the last 15 years and it always felt like pulling teeth), so the main learning I'd get there would be at the applied level... How to tweak the Perlin noise to get the result I want, rather than how or why it works in the first place.

How many supposed ""10x"" coders actually produced unreadable code that no one else could maintain? But then the effort to produce that code is lauded while the nightmare maintenance of said code is somehow regarded as unimpressive, despite being massively more difficult?I worry that we're creating a world where it is becoming easy, even trivial, to be that dysfunctional ""10x"" coder, and dramatically harder to be the competent maintainer. And the existence of AI tools will reinforce the culture gap rather than reducing it.

Personally, I am not stymied by typing nor chores nor driving. For me, typing is like playing a musical instrument: at some point you stop needing to think about how to play and you just play. The interaction and control of the instrument just comes out of your body. At some point in my life, all the ""need to do things around the house"" just became the things I do, and I'm not bothered by doing them, such that I barely notice doing them. But it's complex: the concept of ""chores"" is front and center when you're trying to get a teenager to be responsible for taking care of themselves (like having clean clothes, or how the bathroom is safer if it's not a complete mess) and participating in family/household responsibilities (like learning that if you don't make a mess, there's nothing to clean up). Can you really be effective at directing someone/something else without knowing how to do it yourself? Probably for some things, but not all.

For sure.I idealize a future where people can spend more time doing things they want to do, whatever those avocations might be. Freedom from servitude.

Implicit in that ideal would be elimination of inequality, and I'm certain there are massive forces that would oppose that elimination.

It was always about making something useful for myself and others. And that has never been easier.

Of course, and if LLMs keep improving at current rates it will happen much faster than people think.Arguably you don't need junior software engineers anymore.  When you also don't need senior software engineers anymore it isn't that much of a jump to not needing project managers, managers in general or even software companies at all anymore.Most people, in order to protect their own ego, will assume *their* job is safe until the job one rung down from them disappears and then the justified worrying will begin.People on the ""right things to build"" track love to point out how bad people are at describing requirements, so assume their job as a subject matter expert and/or customer-facing liaison will be safe, but does it matter how bad people are at describing requirements if iteration is lightning fast with the human element removed?Yes, maybe someone who needs software and who isn't historically some sort of software designer is going to have to prompt the LLM 250 times to reach what they really want, but that'll eventually still be faster than involving any humans in a single meeting or phone call.   And a lot of people just won't really need software as we currently think about it at all, they'll just be passing one-off tasks to the AI.The real question is what happens when the labor market for non-physical work completely implodes as AI eats it all.  Based on current trends I'm going to predict in terms of economics and politics we handle it as poorly as possible leading to violent revolution and possible societal collapse, but I'd love to be wrong.

Likewise, being a podcaster, or ""influencer"" in general, is all about charisma and marketing.So with value destruction for knowledge workers (and perhaps physical workers too once you factor in robotics) we may in fact be moving into a real ""attention economy"" where all value is related to being a charismatic marketer, which will be good for some people for a while, terrible for the majority, but even for the winners it seems like a limited reprieve. Historically speaking charismatic marketers can only really exist through the patronage of people who mostly aren't themselves charismatic marketers.   Without patrons (who have disposable income to share) the charismatic marketers are eventually just as fucked as everyone else.

Microsoft / GitHub have no real limitation to doing better/faster, maybe it's the big company mentality, moving slower, fear of taking risks where you have a lot to lose, or when the personal incentive for a product manager at github is much much lower than the one of a co-founder of a seed stage startup. Co-Pilot was a microscopic line item for Microsoft as a whole, and probably marginal for GitHub too. But for Cursor, this was everything.This is why we have innovation, if mega-corps didn't promote people to their level of incompetence, if bureaucracy and politics didn't ruin every good thing, if private equity didn't bleed every beloved product to the last penny, we would have no chance for any innovation or entrepreneurship because these company have practically close to unlimited resources.So my only conclusion from this is - the moat is sometimes just the will to do better, to dare to say, I don't care if someone has a billion dollars to compete with me, I'll still do better.In other words, don't underestimate the power of big companies to make colossal mistakes and build crappy products. My only worry is, that AI would not make the same mistakes an we'll basically have a handful of companies in the world (the makers of models, owner of tokens e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Amazon, Meta, xAi), if AI led product teams will be able to not make the mistakes of modern corporations of ruining everything good that they got in their hands, then maybe software related entrepreneurship will be dead.

I think this (frequent) comparison is incorrect. There are times when quality doesn't matter and times that it does. Without that context these discussions are meaningless.If I build my own table no one really gives a shit about the quality besides me and maybe my friends judging me.But if I sell it, well then people certainly care[0] and they have every right to.If I build my own deck at my house people do also care and there's a reason I need to get permits for this, because the danger it can cause to others. It's not a crazy thing to get your deck inspected and that's really all there is to it.So I don't get these conversations because people are just talking past one another. Look, no one gives a fuck if you poorly vibe code your personal website, or at least it is gonna be the same level as building your own table. But if Ikea starts shipping tables with missing legs (even if it is just 1%) then I sure give a fuck and all the customers have a right to be upset.I really think a major part of this concern with vibe coding is about something bigger. It is about slop in general. In the software industry we've been getting sloppier and sloppier and LLMs significantly amplify that. It really doesn't matter if you can vibe code something with no mistakes, what matters is what the businesses do. Let's be honest, they're rushing and don't care about quality because they have markets cornered and consumers are unable to accurately evaluate products prior to purchase. That's the textbook conditions for a lemon market. I mean the companies outsource tech support so you call and someone picks up who's accent makes you suspicious of their real name being ""Steve"". After all, it is the fourth ""Steve"" you've talked to as you get passed around from support person to support person. The same companies who contract out coders from poor countries and where you find random comments in another language. That's the way things have been going. More vaporware. More half baked products.So yeah, when you have no cake the half baked cake is probably better than nothing. At home it also doesn't matter if you're eating a half baked cake or one that competes with the best bakers in the world. But for everyday people who can't bake their own cakes, what do they do? All they see is a box with a cake in it, one is $1, another for $10, and another other is $100. They look the same but they can't know until they take a bite. You try enough of the $1 cakes and by the time you give up the $10 cakes are all gone. By the time you get so frustrated you'll buy the $100 cake they're gone too.I don't dislike vibe coding because it is ""building things the wrong way"" or any of that pretentious notion. I, and I believe most people with a similar opinion, care because ""the right things"" aren't being built. Most people don't care how things were built, but they sure do care about the result. Really people only start caring about how the sausage is made when they find out that something distasteful is being served and concealed from them. It's why everyone is saying ""slop"".So when people make this false dichotomy it just feels like people aren't listing to what's actually being said.[0] Mind you, it is much easier for an inexperienced person to judge the quality of a table than software.

But considering that AI will more and more ""build things right"" by default, it's up to us humans to decide what are the ""right things to build"".Once AI knows what are the ""right things to build"" better than humans, this is AGI in my book, and also the end of classical capitalism as we know it. Yes, there will still be room for ""human generated"" market, like we have today (photography didn't kill painting, but it made it a much less of a main employment option)In a way, AI is the great equality maker, in the past the strongest men prevailed, then when muscles were not the main means to assert force, it was the intellect, now it's just sheer want. You want to do something, now you can, you have no excuses, you just need to believe it's possible, and do it.As someone else said, agency is eating the world. For now.

I still think this is a bad comparison and I hoped my prior comment would handle this. Frankly, you're always going to end up in the second situation[0] simply because of 2 hard truths. 1) you're not omniscient and 2) even if you were, the environment isn't static.  > But considering that AI will more and more ""build things right"" by default

And this is something I don't believe. I say a lot more here[1] but you can skip my entire comment and just read what Dijkstra has to say himself. I dislike that we often pigeonhole this LLM coding conversation into one about a deterministic vs probabilistic language. Really the reason I'm not in favor of LLMs is because I'm not in favor of natural language programming[2]. The reason I'm not in favor of natural language programming has nothing to do with its probabilistic nature and everything to do with its lack of precision[3].I'm with Dijkstra because, like him, I believe we invented symbolic formalism for a reason. Like him, I believe that abstraction is incredibly useful and powerful, but it is about the right abstraction for the job.[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46911268[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46928421[2] At the end of the day, that's what they are.

The lack of precision is inherently representable through the language of probability but most people aren't familiar with terms like ""image"" and ""pre-image"" nor ""push-forward"" and ""pull-back"".

Yeah, even if they're made to be 100% deterministic, you've now got a programming language whose rules are deterministic, but hard to understand. You've effectively pinned the meaning of the natural language in some way, but not a way that anyone can effectively learn, and one that doesn't necessarily match their understanding of the actual natural language.

reply

The result of natural language programming is either an extremely limited programming language or an extremely verbose one (again, look at law). Presumably it'll result in both.It's a nice idea but ignores the reason we invented symbolic languages in the first place. They were invented after natural language. It's not like code is some vestigial language raiment. We're trying to replace it because it's hard and annoying. But I'm certain that's mainly due to the level of abstraction we're trying to work with more than due to the language we're using

Not because the tools are insufficient, it's just that the kind of person that can't even stomach the charmed life of being a programmer will rarely be able to stomach the dull and hard work of actually being creative.Why should someone be interested in you creations? In what part of your new frictionless life would you've picked up something that sets you apart from a million other vibe-coders?

reply

This strikes me as the opposite of what I experience when I say I'm ""feeling creative"", then everything comes easy. At least in the context of programming, making music, doing 3D animation and some other topics. If it's ""dull and hard work"" it's because I'm not feeling ""creative"" at all, when ""creative mode"" is on in my brain, there is nothing that feels neither dull nor hard. Maybe it works differently for others.

If I had an LLM generate a piece of artwork for me, I wouldn't call myself an artist, no matter how many hours I spent conversing with the LLM in order to refine the image. So I wouldn't call myself a coder if my process was to get an LLM to write most/all the code for me. Not saying the output of either doesn't have value, but I am absolutely fine gatekeeping in this way: you are not an artist/coder if this is how you build your product.  You're an artistic director, a technical product manager, something of that nature.That said, I never derived joy from every single second of coding; there were and are plenty of parts to it that I find tedious or frustrating. I do appreciate being able to let an LLM loose on some of those parts.But sparing use is starting to really only work for hobby projects. I'm not sure I could get away with taking the time to write most of it manually when LLMs might make coworkers more ""productive"". Even if I can convince myself my code is still ""better"" than theirs, that's not what companies value.

I am not myself a woodworker, however I have understood that part of what makes it ""crafty"" is that the woodworker reads grain, adjusts cuts, and accepts that each board is different.We can try to contrast that to whatever Ikea does with wood and mass production of furniture. I would bet that variation in materials is ""noise"" that the mass production process is made to ""reject"" (be insensitive to / be robust to).But could we imagine an automated woodworking system that takes into account material variation, like wood grain, not in an aggregate sense (like I'm painting Ikea to do), but in an individual sense? That system would be making judgements that are woodworker-like.The craft lives on. The system is informed by the judgement of the woodworker, and the craftperson enters an apprenticeship role for the automation... perhaps...Until you can do RL on the outcome of the furniture. But you still need craft in designing the reward function.Perhaps.

Almost none of the code I wrote in 2015 is still in use today. Probably some percentage of people can point to code that lasted 20 years or longer, but it can't be a big percentage. When I think of the work of a craft, I think of doing work which is capable of standing up for a long time. A great builder can make a house that can last for a thousand years and a potter can make a bowl that lasts just as long.I've thought of myself as a craftsman of code for a long time but maybe that was just wrong.

I do believe directing an LLM to write code, and then reviewing and refining that code with the LLM, is a skill that has value -- a ton of value! -- but I do not think it is coding.It's more like super-technical product management, or like a tech lead pair programming with a junior, but in a sort of mentorship way where they direct and nudge the junior and stay as hands-off as possible.It's not coding, and once that's the sum total of what you do, you are no longer a coder.You can get defensive and call this gatekeeping, but I think it's just the new reality. There's no shame in admitting that you've moved to a stage of your life where you build software but your role in it isn't as a coder anymore. Just as there's no shame in moving into management, if that's what you enjoy and are effective at it.(If presenting credentials is important to you, as you've done, I've been doing this since 1989, when I was 8 years old.

Even though once upon a time both did.Claiming that this isn't coding is as absurd as saying that coding is only what you do when you hook up the wires between some vacuum tubes.The LLM is a very smart compiler. That's all.Some people want to sit and write assembly. Good for them. But asserting that unless I assemble my own code I'm not a coder is just silly.

To me, you sound more utilitarian. The philosophy you are presenting is a kind of Ikea philosophy. Utility, mass production, and unique beauty are generally properties that do not cohere together, and there's a reason for this. I think the use of LLMs in the production of digital goods is very close to the use of automation lines in the production of physical goods. No matter how you try some of the human charm, and thus beauty will inevitably be lost, the number of goods will increase, but they'll all be barely differentiable souless replications of more or less the same shallow ideas repeated as infinitum.

With the code, especially interfaces, the results will be similar -- more standardized palettes, predictable things.To be fair, the converging factor is going on pretty much forever, e.g. radio/TV led to the lots of local accents disappearing, our world is heavily globalized.

It's one thing to have your approach where you're using AI to help w/ the code, but it's totally another to pretend like ""code"" is not something you were ever interested in, so it's okay for the AI to write it while you're busy ""solving problems,"" which doesn't make a lot of sense to me.

Luckily for real programmers, AI's not actually very good at generating quality code. It generates the equivalent of Ali Baba code: it lasts for one week and then breaks.This is going to be the future of programming: low-paid AI clerks to generate the initial software, and then the highly paid programmers who fix all the broken parts.

For me, the act of sitting down and writing the code is what actually leads to true understanding of the logic, in a similar way to how the only way to understand a mathematical proof is to go trough it. Sure, I'm not doing anything useful by showing that the root of 2 is irrational, but by doing that I gain insights that are otherwise impossible to transfer between two minds.I believe that coding was one of the few things (among, for example, writing math proofs, or that weird process of crafting something with your hands where the object you are building becomes intimately evident) that get our brains to a higher level of abstraction than normal mammal ""survival"" thinking. And it makes me very sad to see it thrown out of the window in the name of a productivity that may not even be real.

For 99% of the functions I've written in my life? Absolutely drudgery. They're barely algorithms. Just bog-standard data transformation. This is what I love having AI replace.For the other 1% that actually requires original thought, truly clever optimization, and smart naming to make it literate? Yes, I'll still be doing that by hand, although I'll probably be getting the LLM to help scaffold all the unit tests and check for any subtle bugs or edge cases I may have missed.The point is, LLMs let me spend more time at the higher level of abstraction that is more productive. It's not taking it away!

To the skeptics: by all means, don't use AI if you don't want to; it's your choice, your career, your life. But I am not sure that hitching your identity to hating AI is altogether a good idea. It will make you increasingly bitter as these tools improve further and our industry and the wider world slowly shifts to incorporate them.Frankly, I consider the mourning of The Craft of Software to be just a little myopic. If there are things to worry about with AI they are bigger things, like widespread shifts in the labor force and economic disruption 10 or 20 years from now, or even the consequences of the current investment bubble popping. And there are bigger potential gains in view as well. I want AI to help us advance the frontiers of science and help us get to cures for more diseases and ameliorate human suffering. If a particular way of working in a particular late-20th and early-21st century profession that I happen to be in goes away but we get to those things, so be it. I enjoy coding. I still do it without AI sometimes. It's a pleasant activity to be good at. But I don't kid myself that my feelings about it are all that important in the grand scheme of things.

They can not. They can make some average code. On Friday one suggested an NSI installer script that would never bundle some needed files in the actual installer. I can only imagine that a lot of people have made the same mistake (used CopyFiles instead of File) and posted that mistake on the internet. The true disaster of that being that then testing out that installer on the developer's PC, where that CopyFiles may well work fine since the needed files happen to be sitting on that PC, would then lead on to think it was some weird bug that only failed on the end user's PC. I bet a lot of people posted it with comments like ""this worked fine when I tried it,"" and here we are a decade later feeding that to an LLM.These tools can write average code. That's what they've mostly been fed; that's what they're aiming for when they do their number crunching. The more specifically one prompts, I expect, then the more acceptable that average code will be. In some cases, average appears to be shockingly bad (actually, based on a couple of decades' experience in the game, average is generally pretty bad - I surely must have been churning out some average, bad code twenty years ago). If I want better than average, I'm going to have to do it myself.

Your craft is not my craft.It's entirely possible that, as of now, writing JavaScript and Java frontends (what the author does) can largely be automated with LLMs. I don't know who the author is writing to, but I do not mistake the audience to be ""programmers"" in general...If you are making something that exists, or something that is very similar to something that exists, odds are that an LLM can be made to generate code which approximates that thing. The LLM encoding is lossy. How will you adjust the output to recover the loss? What process will you go through mentally to bridge the gap? When does the gap appear? How do you recognize it? In the absolute best case you are given a highly visible error. Perhaps you've even shipped it, and need to provide context about the platform and circumstances to further elucidate. Better hope that platform and circumstance is old-hat.

    We'll miss creating something we feel proud of, something true and right and good. We'll miss the satisfaction of the artist's signature at the bottom of the oil painting, the GitHub repo saying “I made this.”

I definitely feel this some days.
It used to be that I would nitpick code to death to get it just so, proud of the artistic decisions I made. Not only was it functional, but it was beautiful, crisp, elegant, clever.Just the right abstractions. Complicated problems reduced to perfectly legible structures, easy to read for newcomers, easy to extend when new problems arise.Extracting that from an LLM just doesn't produce the same feeling, even when it produces the same results. And they don't reliably produce the same results yet even, just poor imitations, however functional.On the other hand, when they work, I am empowered to produce code I would have never thought of. I'm empowered to bounce an idea off an oracle that knows all the answers, and can tailor its responses to my exact use case. I'm coming around to finding the joy in that. I have to.

Debugging with LLMs is also a mixed experience; they can identify plenty of hypotheses very well, thanks to millions of dollars spent in RL, but they lack a more profound understanding of causal chains. They will try to change more than one thing at a time, even when doing so will completely invalidate the experiment; they will get into bizarre loops and weird tangents. They can help a lot, but if you want to have good results, it is way better if you strongly take control of the steering wheel.LLMs are basically the average developer, although with way more breadth. But still not much depth.

1. Crafting something beautiful. Figuring out correct abstractions and mapping them naturally to language constructs. Nailing just the right amount of flexibility, scalability and robustness. Writing self-explanatory, idiomatic code that is a pleasure to read. It's an art.2. Building useful things. Creating programs that are useful to myself and to others, and watching them bring value to the world. It's engineering.These things have utility but they are also enjoyable onto themselves. As best I can tell, your emotional response to coding agents depends on how much you care about these two things.AI has taken away the joy of crafting beautiful things, and has amplified the joy of building things by more than 10x. Safe bet: It will get to 100x this year.I am very happy with this tradeoff. Over the years I grew to value building things much more highly. 20yo me would've been devastated.

After ten years of professional coding, LLMs have made my work more fun. Not easier in the sense of being less demanding, but more engaging. I am involved in more decisions, deeper reviews, broader systems, and tighter feedback loops than before. The cognitive load did not disappear. It shifted.My habits have changed. I stopped grinding algorithm puzzles because they started to feel like practicing celestial navigation in the age of GPS. It is a beautiful skill, but the world has moved on. The fastest path to a solution has always been to absorb existing knowledge. The difference now is that the knowledge base is interactive. It answers back and adapts to my confusion.Syntax was never the job. Modeling reality was. When generation is free, judgment becomes priceless.We have lost something, of course. There is less friction now, which means we lose the suffering we often mistook for depth. But I would rather trade that suffering for time spent on design, tradeoffs, and problems that used to be out of reach.This doesn't feel like a funeral. It feels like the moment we traded a sextant for a GPS. The ocean is just as dangerous and just as vast, but now we can look up at the stars for wonder, rather than just for coordinates.

Yes, watching an LLM spit out lots of code is for sure mesmerizing. Small tasks usually work ok, code kinda compiles, so for some scenarios it can work out.. BUT anyone serious about software development can see how piece of CRAP the code is.LLMs are great tools overall, great to bounce ideas, great to get shit done. If you have a side project and no time, awesome.. If your boss/company has a shitty culture and you just want to get the task done, great. Got a mundane coding task, hate coding, or your code wont run in a critical environment? please, LLM that shit over 9000..Remember though, an LLM is just a predictor, a noisy, glorified text predictor. Only when AI reaches a point of not optimizing for short term gains and has built-in long term memory architecture (similar to humans) AND can produce some linux kernel level code and size, then we can talk..

English or any other natural language can of course be concise enough, but when being brief they leave much to imagination. Adding verbosity allows for greater precision, but I think as well that that is what formal languages are for, just as you said.Although, I think it's worth contemplating whether the modern programming languages/environments have been insufficient in other ways. Whether by being too verbose at times, whether the IDEs should be more like databases first and language parsers second, whether we could add recommendations using far simpler, but more strict patterns given a strongly typed language.My current gripes are having auto imports STILL not working properly in most popular IDEs or an IDE not finding referenced entity from a file, if it's not currently open... LLMs sometimes help with that, but they are extremely slow in comparison to local cache resolution.Long term I think more value will be in directly improving the above, but we shall see. AI will stay around too of course, but how much relevance it'll have in 10 years time is anybody's guess. I think it'll become a commodity, the bubble will burst and we'll only use it when sensible after a while. At least until the next generation of AI architecture will arrive.

Mathematicians use LLMs. Obviously, they don't trust LLM to do math. But LLM can help with formalizing a theorem, then finding a formal proof. It's usually a very tedious thing - but LLMs are _already_ quite good at that. In the end you get a proof which gets checked by normal proof-checking software (not LLM!), you can also inspect, break into parts, etc.You really need to look into detail rather than dismiss wholesale (""It made a math error so it's bad at math"" is wrong.)

With woodworking and farming you get as a result some physical goods. Some John Smith that buys furniture can touch nice cherry paneling, appreciate the joinery and grain.

Most jobs don't have the same level of verification and/or repeatability. Some factors include:* Physical constraints: Even the jobs that have productive output if they are physical it will take a long time for AI and more importantly energy density to catch up. Robots have a while to go as well - in the end human hands and your metabolism/energy density will be worth more than your brain/intelligence.* Cost of failure/can't repeat: For things like building the cost of failure is high (e.g. disposal, cleanup, more resources, etc) -> even 70% of a ""building bench"" benchmark would be completely inadequate without low cost to repeat. Many jobs are also already largely automated but scaled (e.g. mining, manufacturing, etc) - they've already gone through the wave.* Human need for its own sake: Other jobs cater not just for productive output, but for some human need where it hasn't been made more efficient ever (e.g. care jobs). There are jobs that a human is more effective in the medium term because the receiver needs it from a human.No -> this just affects white collar STEM based roles. Thinking we are in it together is just another form of ""cope"" sadly. There's a rational reason why others have optimism while we SWE's are now full of anxiety and dread.For the people who it doesn't affect given their current place in many societies (nurses, builders, etc etc) there will be little sympathy.

I'm in consulting now and it's all the same crap. Enterprises want to “unleash AI” so they can fire people. Maximize profits. My nephews who are just starting their careers are blindly using these tools and accepting the PR if it builds. Not if it's correct.I'm in awe of what it can do but I also am not impressed with the quality of how it does it.I'm fortunate to not have any debt so I can float until the world either wises up or the winds of change push me in a new direction.I liked the satisfaction of building something “right” that was also “useful”. The current state of Opus and Codex can only pretend to do the latter.

I would add a nuance from OPs perspective sorta: a close friend of mine works in construction, and often comments on how projects can be different. On some, everyone in the entire building supply chain can be really inspired to work on a really interesting project because of either its usefulness or its craftsmanship (the 2 of which are related), and on some, everyone's, just trying to finish the project is cheaply quickly as possible.It's not that the latter hasn't existed in tech, but it does appear that there is a way to use LLMs to do more of the latter. It's not “the end of a craft”, but without a breakthrough (and something to check the profit incentive) it's also not a path to utopia (like other comments seem to be implying)Craftsmanship doesn't die, it evolves, but the space in between can be a bit exhausting as markets fail to understand the difference at first.

What I do mourn is the reliability. We're in this weird limbo where it's like rolling a die for every piece of work. If it comes up 1-5, I would have been better off implementing it myself. If it comes up 6, it'll get it done orders of magnitude faster than doing it by hand. Since the overall speedup is worthwhile, I have to try it every time, even if most of the time it fails. And of course it's a moving target, so I have to keep trying the things that failed yesterday because today's models are more capable.

It seems in the next few months it could probably do more than that. But is it so bad, I agree that I can't really mold an entire pot by my hand any more. But, if you ask AI to do it, it will create a pot with cracks in it and it would be your job to either plaster it of fill gold in those cracks.I feel coding is going to be similar to kintsugi after this is all over

And for the record, I'm impressed at issues it can diagnose. Being able to query multiple data sources in parallel and detect anomalies, it sometimes can find the root cause for an incident in a distributed system in a matter of minutes. I have many examples when LLMs found bugs in existing code when tasked to write unit tests (usually around edge cases).But complex issues that stem from ambiguous domain are often out of reach. By the time I'm able to convey to an LLM all the intricacies of the domain using plain English, I'm usually able to find the issue myself.And that's my point: I'd be more eager to run the code under debugger till 2am, than to push an LLM to debug for me (can easily take till 2am, but I'd be less confident I can succeed at all)

I agree that it's very destabilizing. It's sort of like inflation for expertise. You spend all this time and effort saving up expertise, and then those savings rapidly lose value. At the same time, your ability to acquire new expertise has accelerated (because LLMs are often excellent private tutors), which is analogous to an inflation-adjusted wage increase.There are a ton of variables. Will hallucinations ever become negligible? My money is on ""no"" as long as the architecture is basically just transformers. How will compiling training data evolve with time? My money is on ""it will get more expensive"". How will legislators react? I sure hope not by suppressing competition. As long as markets and VC are functioning properly, it should only become easier to become a founder, so outsized corporate profits will be harder to lock down.

Question: Have you tried using LLM as a compiler?Well, I sort of did, as a fun exercise. I came up with a very elaborate ~5000 tokens prompt, such that when fed with a  ~500 tokens function, I will get back a ~600 tokens rewritten function.The prompt contains 10+ examples, such that the model will learn the steps from the context. Then, it will start by going through a series of yes/no questions, to decide what's the correct rewrite pattern to apply. The tricky part here is the lack of precision, such that the ""else"" clause has to be reserved for the condition that is the hardest to communicate clearly in English. Then it will extract the part that needs to be rewritten and introspect the formatting, again with a series of simple questions. Lastly, it will proceed, confidently, with the rewrite.With this, I did some testing with 50+ randomly chosen functions, and I could get back the exact same rewritten functions, from about 20 models that are good in coding, down to the newlines and indentations. With a strong model, there might only be 1~2 output tokens in the whole test where the probability was less than 80%, so the lack of batch invariance wasn't even a problem. (temperature=0 usually messes up logprobs, go with top_k=1 or top_p=0.01)So input + English = output, works for multiple models from multiple companies.But what's the point of writing so much English, in hope that it leaves no room for ambiguity? For now, I will stick with mitchellh's style of (occasional) LLM assisted programming, jumping in to write the code when precision is needed.

But I've seen this conversation on HN already 100 times.The answer they always give is that compilers are deterministic and therefore trustworthy in ways that LLMs are not.I personally don't agree at all, in the sense I don't think that matters. I've run into compiler bugs, and more library bugs than I can count. The real world is just as messy as LLMs are, and you still need the same testing strategies to guard against errors. Development is always a slightly stochastic process of writing stuff that you eventually get to work on your machine, and then fixing all the bugs that get revealed once it starts running on other people's machines in the wild. LLMs don't write perfect code, and neither do you. Both require iteration and testing.

I don't see this as a frequent answer tbh, but I do frequently see claims that this is the critique.I wrote much more here[0] and honestly I'm on the side of Dijkstra, and it doesn't matter if the LLM is deterministic or probabilistic  It may be illuminating to try to imagine what would have happened if, right from the start our native tongue would have been the only vehicle for the input into and the output from our information processing equipment. My considered guess is that history would, in a sense, have repeated itself, and that computer science would consist mainly of the indeed black art how to bootstrap from there to a sufficiently well-defined formal system. We would need all the intellect in the world to get the interface narrow enough to be usable, and, in view of the history of mankind, it may not be overly pessimistic to guess that to do the job well enough would require again a few thousand years.
  - Dijkstra: On the foolishness of ""natural language programming""

His argument has nothing to do with the deterministic systems[1] and all to do with the precision of the language. His argument comes down to ""we invented symbolic languages for a good reason"".[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46928421[1] If we want to be more pedantic we can actually codify his argument more simply by using some mathematical language, but even this will take some interpretation: natural language naturally imposes a one to many relationship when processing information.

  It may be illuminating to try to imagine what would have happened if, right from the start our native tongue would have been the only vehicle for the input into and the output from our information processing equipment. My considered guess is that history would, in a sense, have repeated itself, and that computer science would consist mainly of the indeed black art how to bootstrap from there to a sufficiently well-defined formal system. We would need all the intellect in the world to get the interface narrow enough to be usable, and, in view of the history of mankind, it may not be overly pessimistic to guess that to do the job well enough would require again a few thousand years.

It's not about having abstraction levels above or below (BTW, in 21st century CPUs, the machine code itself is an abstraction over much more complex CPU internals).It's about writing a more correct, efficient, elegant, and maintainable code at whichever abstraction layer you choose.AI still writes messier, sloppier, buggier, more redundant code than a good programmer can when they care about the craft of writing code.The end result is worse to those who care about the quality of code.We mourn, because the quality we paid so much attention to is becoming unimportant compared to the sheer quantity of throwaway code that can be AI-generated.We're fine dining chefs losing to factory-produced junk food.

UB is actually a big deal, and is avoided for a reason.I couldn't in my life guess what CC would do in response to ""implement login form"".
For all I know CC's response could depend on time of day or Anthropic's electricity bill last month more, than on the existing code in my app, and the specific wording I use.

Seems to me that people just confuse determinism with soundness.Determinism is just whether the output of the tool (machine code) is determined by the input (source code), i.e., for one input always returns the same output.Soundness means that output is always consistent with the semantics of the input. i.e. returned machine code always does what is specified by the source code.Compilers can be non-deterministic (although usually are deterministic), but they are always sound (ignoring compiler bugs).LLMs can be deterministic (although usually aren't), but they are not sound in general.

When I write a program, I understand the architecture of the computer, I understand the assembly, I understand the compiler, and I understand the code. There are things that I don't understand, and as I push to understand them, I am rewarded by being able to do more things. In other words, Understanding is both beautiful and incentivized.When making something with an LLM, I am disincentivized from actually understanding what is going on, because understanding is very slow, and the whole point of using AI is speed. The only time when I need to really understand something is when something goes wrong, and as the tool improves, this need will shrink. In the normal and intended usage, I only need to express a desire to achieve a result. Now, I can push against the incentives of the system. But for one, most people will not do that at all; and for two, the tools we use inevitably shape us. I don't like the shape into which these tools are forming me - the shape of an incurious, dull, impotent person who can only ask for someone else to make something happen for me. Remember, The Medium Is The Message, and the Medium here is, Ask, and ye shall receive.The fact that AI use leads to a reduction in Understanding is not only obvious, but also studies have shown the same. People who can't see this are refusing to acknowledge the obvious, in my opinion. They wouldn't disagree that having someone else do your homework for you would mean that you didn't learn anything. But somehow when an LLM tool enters the picture, it's different. They're a manager now instead of a lowly worker. The problem with this thinking is that, in your example, moving from say Assembly to C automates tedium to allow us to reason on a higher level. But LLMs are automating reasoning itself. There is no higher level to move to. The reasoning you do now while using AI is merely a temporary deficiency in the tool. It's not likely that you or I are the .01% of people who can create something truly novel that is not already sufficiently compressed into the model. So enjoy that bit of reasoning while you can, o thou Man of the Gaps.They say that writing is God's way of showing you how sloppy your thinking is. AI tools discourage one from writing. They encourage us to prompt, read, and critique. But this does not result in the same Understanding as writing does. And so our thinking will be, become, and remain vapid, sloppy, inarticulate, invalid, impotent. Welcome to the future.

  > why do you not program in assembly?

There's a balance of levels of abstraction. Abstraction is a great thing. Abstraction can make your programs faster, more flexible, and more easy to understand. But abstraction can also make your programs slower, more brittle, and incomprehensible.The point of code is to write specification. That is what code is. The whole reason we use a pedantic and somewhat cryptic schema is that natural language is too abstract. This is the exact reason we created math. It really is even the same reason we created things like ""legalese"".Seriously, just try a simple exercise and be adversarial to yourself. Describe how to do something and try to find loopholes. Malicious compliance. It's hard, to defend and writing that spec becomes extremely verbose, right? Doesn't this actually start to become easier by using coding techniques? Strong definitions? Have we not all forgotten the old saying ""a computer does exactly what you tell it to, not what you intend to tell it to do""? Vibe coding only adds a level of abstraction to that. It becomes ""a computer does what it 'thinks' you are telling it to do, not what you intend to tell it to do"". Be honest with yourself, which paradigm is easier to debug?Natural language is awesome because the abstraction really compresses concepts, but it requires inference of the listener. It requires you to determine what the speaker intends to say rather than what the speaker actually says.Without that you'd have to be pedantic to even describe something as mundane as making a sandwich[1]. But inference also leads to misunderstandings and frankly, that is a major factor of why we talk past one another when talking on large global communication systems. Have you never experienced culture shock? Never experienced where someone misinterprets you and you realize that their interpretation was entirely reasonable?[2] Doesn't this knowledge also help resolve misunderstandings as you take a step back and recheck assumptions about these inferences?  > using temperature 0.0

Because, as you should be able to infer from everything I've said above, the problem isn't actually about randomness in the system. Making the system deterministic only has one realistic outcome: a programming language. You're still left with the computer doing what you tell it to do, but have made this more abstract. You've only turned it into the PB&J problem[1] and frankly, I'd rather write code than instructions like those kids are. Compared to the natural language the kids are using, code is more concise, easier to understand, more robust, and more flexible.I really think Dijkstra explains things well[0]. (I really do encourage reading the entire thing. It is short and worth the 2 minutes. His remark at the end is especially relevant in our modern world where it is so easy to misunderstand one another...)  The virtue of formal texts is that their manipulations, in order to be legitimate, need to satisfy only a few simple rules; they are, when you come to think of it, an amazingly effective tool for ruling out all sorts of nonsense that, when we use our native tongues, are almost impossible to avoid.

  Instead of regarding the obligation to use formal symbols as a burden, we should regard the convenience of using them as a privilege: thanks to them, school children can learn to do what in earlier days only genius could achieve.

In that analogy that would be picking the right library/framework/service vs. vibe coding it.

I don't like this particular phrase, as it suggests that LLMs are just replicating code. As far as I understand, LLMs can also create new code and algorithms (some better than others). When we think of them as copy-paste-maschines, we judge their capabilities unfairly and also underestimate their capabilities.

Sure, maybe it takes me a little while to ride across town on my bike, but I can reliably get there and I understand every aspect of the road to my destination. The bazooka-powered jetpack might get me there in seconds, but it also might fly me across state lines, or to Antarctica, or the moon first, belching out clouds of toxic gas along the way.

I've built a number of team-specific tools with LLM agents over the past year that save each of us tens of hours a month.They don't scale beyond me and my six coworkers, and were never designed to, but they solve challenges we'd previously worked through manually and allow us to focus on more important tasks.The code may be non-optimal and won't become the base of a new startup. I'm fine with that.It's also worth noting that your evidence list (increased CVEs, outages, degraded quality) is exclusively about what happens when LLMs are dropped into existing development workflows. That's a real concern, but it's a different conversation from whether LLMs create useful software.My tools weren't degraded versions of something an engineer would have built better. They're net-new capability that was never going to get engineering resources in the first place. The counterfactual in my case isn't “worse software”—it's “no software.“

Anything that proves that LLMs increase software quality. Any software built with an LLM that is actually in production, survives maintenance, doesn't have 100 CVEs, that people actually use.

And there are studies on this subject, like the MITRE study that shows that development speed decreases with LLMs while developers think it increases speed.

It shows, increased outages, increased vulnerabilities, windows failing to boot, windows task bar is still react native and barely works. And I have spoken to engineers at FANG companies, they are forced to use LLMs, managers are literally tracking metrics. So where is all this amazing new software and software quality or increased productivity from them?

Like iambateman said: for me it was never about code. Code was a means to an ends and it didn't stop at code. I'm the kind of software engineer that learned frontends, systems, databases, ETLs, etc -- whatever it was that was that was demanded of me to produce something useful I learned and did it. We're now calling that a ""product engineer"". The ""craft"" for me was in creating useful things that were reliable and efficient, not particularly how I styled lines, braces, and brackets. I still do that in the age of AI.All of this emotional spillage feels for not. The industry is changing as it always has. The only constant I've ever experienced in this industry is change. I realized long ago that when the day comes that I am no longer comfortable with change then that is my best signal that this industry is no longer for me.

I use these tools every day to be more productive and improve my code but they are nowhere close to doing my actual job, that is figuring out WHAT to do. How to do it is mostly irrelevant, as once i get to that point i already know what needs to be done and it doesn't matter if it is me or Opus producing the code.

As an (ex-)programmer in his late 40s, I couldn't agree more. I'm someone who can be detail-oriented (but, I think also with a mind toward practicality) to the point of obsession, and I think this trait served me extremely well for nearly 25 years in my profession. I no longer think that is the case. And I think this is true for a lot of developers - they liked to stress and obsess over the details of ""authorship"", but now that programming is veering much more towards ""editor"", they just don't find the day-to-day work nearly as satisfying. And, at least for me, I believe this while not thinking the change to using generative AI is ""bad"", but just that it's changed the fundamentals of the profession, and that when something dies it's fine to mourn it.If anything, I'm extremely lucky that my timing was such that I was able to do good work in a relatively lucrative career where my natural talents were an asset for nearly a quarter of a century. I don't feel that is currently the case regarding programming, so I'm fortunate enough to be able to leave the profession and go into violin making, where my obsession with detail and craft is again a huge asset.

Many are calling people like me Luddites for mourning this, and I think that I am prepared to wear that label with pride. I own multiple looms and a spinning wheel, so I think I may be in a better position speculates on how the Luddites  felt than most people are nowadays.And what I see is that the economic realities are what they are - like what happened to cottage industry textile work, making software by hand is no longer the economical option. Or at least, soon enough it won't be. I can fret about deskilling all I like, but it seems that soon enough these skills won't be particularly valuable except as a form of entertainment.Perhaps the coding agents won't be able to make certain things or use certain techniques. That was the case for textile manufacturing equipment, too. If so then the world at large will simply learn to live without. The techniques will live on, of course, but their practical value will be as an entertainment for enthusiasts and a way for them to recognize one another when we see it in each others' work.It's not a terrible future, I suppose, in à long enough view. The world will move on, just like it did after the Industrial Revolution. But, perhaps also like the Industrial Revolution and other similar points in history, not until after we get through another period where a small cadre of wealthy elites who own and control this new equipment use that power to usher in a new era of neofeudalism. Hopefully this time they won't start quite so many wars while they enjoy their power trips.

My whole life I have been reading other people's code to accumulate best practices and improve myself. While a lot of developers start with reading documentation, I have always started with reading code.And where I was previously using the GitHub Code Search to eat up as much example code as I could, I am now using LLMs to speed the whole process up. Enormously. I for one enjoy using it.That said, I have been in the industry for more than 15 years. And all companies I have been at are full of data silos, tribal knowledge about processes and organically grown infrastructure, that requires careful changes to not break systems you didn't even know about.Actually most of my time isn't put into software development at all. It's about trying to know the users and colleagues I work with, understand their background and understand how my software supports them in their day to day job.I think LLMs are very, very impressive, but they have a long way to go to reach empathy.

I feel generative AI is being imposed onto society.  While it is a time-saving tool for many applications, I also think there are many domains where generative AI needs to be evaluated much more cautiously.  However, there seems to be relentless pressure to “move fast and break things,” to adopt technology due to its initial labor-saving benefits without fully evaluating its drawbacks.  That's why I feel generative AI is an imposition.I also resent the power and control that Big Tech has over society and politics, especially in America where I live.  I remember when Google was about indexing the Web, and I first used Facebook when it was a social networking site for college students.  These companies became successful because they provided useful services to people.  Unfortunately, once these companies gained our trust and became immensely wealthy, they started exploiting their wealth and power.  I will never forget how so many Big Tech leaders sat at Trump's second inauguration, some of whom got better seats than Trump's own wife and children.  I highly resent OpenAI's cornering of the raw wafer market and the subsequent exorbitant hikes in RAM and SSD prices.Honestly, I have less of an issue with large language models themselves and more of an issue with how a tiny handful of powerful people get to dictate the terms and conditions of computing for society.  I'm a kid who grew up during the personal computing revolution, when computation became available to the general public.  I fell for the “computers for the rest of us,” “information at your fingertips” lines.  I wanted to make a difference in the world through computing, which is why I pursued a research career and why I teach computer science.I've also sat and watched research industry-wide becoming increasingly driven by short-term business goals rather than by long-term visions driven by the researchers themselves.  I've seen how “publish-and-perish” became the norm in academia, and I also saw DOGE's ruthless cuts in research funding.  I've seen how Big Tech won the hearts and minds of people, only for it to leverage its newfound power and wealth to exploit the very people who made Big Tech powerful and wealthy.The tech industry has changed, and not for the better.  This is what I mourn.

But software engineering is the only industry that is built on the notion of rapid change, constant learning, and bootstrapping ourselves to new levels of abstraction so that we don't repeat ourselves and make each next step even more powerful.Just yesterday we were pair programming with a talented junior AI developer. Today we are treating them as senior ones and can work with several in parallel. Very soon your job will not be pair programming and peer reviewing at all, but teaching a team of specialized coworkers to work on your project. In a year or two we will be assembling factories of such agents that will handle the process from taking your requirements to delivering and maintaining complex software. Our jobs are going to change many more times and much more often than ever.And yet there will still be people finding solace in hand-crafting their tools, or finding novel algorithms, or adding the creativity aspect into the work of their digital development teams. Like people lovingly restoring their old cars in their garage just for the sake of the process itself.And everything will be just fine.

Not sure I agree. I think most programming today looks almost exactly the same as it did 40 years ago. You could even have gotten away with never learning a new language. AI feels like the first time a large percentage of us may be forced to fundamentally change the way we work or change careers.

I'm using a mix of Gemini, grok, and gpt to translate some matlab into c++. It is kinda okay at its job but not great? I am rapidly reading Accelerated C++ to get to the point where I can throw the llm out the window. If it was python or Julia I wouldn't be using an LLM at all bc I know those languages. AI is barely better than me at C++ because I'm halfway through my first ever book on it. What LLMs are these people using?The code I'm translating isn't even that complex - it runs analysis on ecg/ppg data to implement this one dude's new diagnosis algorithm. The hard part was coming up with the algorithm, the code is simple. And the shit the LLM pours out works kinda okay but not really? I have to do hours of fix work on its output. I'm doing all the hard design work myself.I fucking WISH I could only work on biotech and research and send the code to an LLM. But I can't because they suck so I gotta learn how computer memory works so my C++ doesn't eat up all my pc's memory. What magical LLMs are yall using??? Please send them my way! I want a free llm therapist and a programmer! What world do you live in?? Let me in!

I think also they tend to be generating non-C++ code where there are more guardrails and less footguns for LLMs to run into. Eg they're generating Javascript or Python or Rust where type systems and garbage collection eliminates entire classes of mistakes that LLMs can run into. I know you said you don't use it for Python because you know the language but even experienced Python devs still see value in LLM-generating Python code.

My worry about an agent is I'm trying to translate the math with full fidelity and an agent might take liberties with the math rather than full accuracy. I'm already having issues with 0 to 1 indexing screwing up some of the algorithm.But I will try an agent - can't hurt to try

I would also point out that the author, and many AI enthusiasts, still make certain optimistic assumptions about the future role of ""developer,"" insisting that the nature of the work will change, but that it will somehow, in large measure, remain. I doubt that. I could easily envision a future where the bulk of software development becomes something akin to googling--just typing the keywords you think are relevant until the black box gives you what you want. And we don't pay people to google, or at least, we don't pay them very much.

Sure, if you have the money, get a carpenter to build your kitchen from solid oak. Most people buy MDF, or even worse, chipboard. IKEA, etc. In fact, not too long ago, I had a carpenter install prefabricated cabinets in a new utility room. The cabinets were pre-assembled, and he installed them on the wall in the right order and did the detailed fittings. He didn't do a great job, and I could have done better, albeit much slower. I use handsaws simply because I'm afraid of circular saws, but I digress.A lot of us here are like carpenters before IKEA and prefabricated cabinets, and we are just now facing a new reality. We scream “it is not the same”. It indeed isn't for us. But the consumers will get better value for money. Not quality, necessarily, but better value.How about us? We will eventually be kitchen designers (aka engineers, architects), or kitchen installers (aka programmers). And yes, compared to the golden years, those jobs will suck.But someone, somewhere, will be making bespoke, luxury furniture that only a few can afford. Or maybe we will keep doing it anyway because our daily jobs suck, until we decide to stop. And that is when the craft will die.The world will just become less technical, as is the case with other industrial goods. Who here even knows how a combustion engine works? Who knows how fabric is made, or even how a sawing machine works? We are very much like the mechanics of yesteryear before cars became iPads on wheels.As much as we hate it, we need to accept that coding has peaked. Juniors will be replaced by AI, experts will retire. Innovation will be replaced by processes. And we must accept our place in history.

I have to say this reads a bit hollow to me, and perhaps a little bit shallow.If the content this guy created could be scraped and usefully regurgitated by an LLM, that same hack, before LLMs, could have simply searched, found the content and still profited off of it nonetheless.  And probably could have done so without much more thought than that required to use the LLM.  The only real difference introduced by the LLM is that the purpose of the scraping is different than that done by a search engine.But let's get rid of the loaded term ""hack"" and be a little less emotional and the complaint.  Really the author had published some works and presumably did so that people could consume that content: without first knowing who was going to consume it and for what purpose.It seems to me what the author is really complaining about is that the reward from the consuming party has been displaced from himself to whoever owns the LLM.  The outcome of consumption and use hasn't changed... only who got credit for the original work has.Now I'm not suggesting that this is an invalid complaint, but trying to avoid saying, ""I posted this for my benefit""... be that commercial (ads?) or even just for public recognition...is a bit disingenuous.If you poured you knowledge, experience, and creativity into some content for others to consume and someone else took that content as their own... just be forthright about what you really lost and don't disparage the consumer.  Just because they aren't your ""hacks"" anymore, but that middlemen are now reaping your rewards.

Nothing will prevent you from typing “JavaScript with your hands”, from “holding code in our hands and molding it like clay…”, and all the other metaphors.

Except the community of people who, for whatever reason, had to throw themselves into it and had critical mass to both distribute and benefit from the passion of it.  This has already been eroded by the tech industry coopting programming in general and is only going to diminish.The people who discovered something because they were forced to do some hard work and then ran with it are going to be steered away from that direction by many.

If you are arguing that standard of living today is lower than in the past, I think that is a very steep uphill battle to argueIf your worries are about ecology and sustainability I agree that is a concern we need to address more effectively than we have in the past. Technology will almost certainly be part of that solution via things like fusion energy. Success is not assured and we cannot just sit back and say ""we live in the best of all possible worlds with a glorious manifest destiny"", but I don't think that the future is particularly bleak compared to the past

I worry that humanity has a track record of diving head first into new technologies without worrying about externalities like the environment or job displacement.I wish we were more thoughtful and focused more on minimizing the downsides of new technologies.Instead it seems we're headed full steam towards huge amounts of energy use and job displacement. And the main bonus is rich people get richer.I'm not sure if having software be cheaper is beneficial. Is it good for malware to be easier to produce? I'd personally choose higher quality software over more software.I'm not convinced cheaper mass produced clothing has been a net positive. Will AI be a positive? Time will tell. In the short term there are some obvious negatives.

What's much more interesting is looking back 6, 12, 18, or 24 months. 6 months ago was ChatGPT 5, 12 months ago was GPT 4.5, 18 months ago was 4o, and 24 months ago ChatGPT 3.5 was released (the first one). If you've been following closely you'll have seen incredible changes between each of them. Not to get to perfect, because that's not really a reasonable goal, but definite big leaps forward each time. A couple of years ago one-shotting a basic tic tac toe wasn't really possible. Now though, you can one-shot a fairly complex web app. It won't be perfect, or even good by a lot of measures compared to human written software, but it will work.I think the comparison to the internet is a good one. I wrote my first website in 1997, and saw the rapid iteration of websites and browsers back then. It felt amazing, and fast. AI feels the same to me. But given the fact that browsers still aren't good in a lot of ways I think it's fair to say AI will take a similarly long time. That doesn't mean the innovations along the way aren't freaking cool though.

What's happening now is training models for long-running tasks that use tools, taking hours at a time. The latest models like 4.6 and 5.3 are starting to make good on this. If you're not using models that are wired into tools and allowed to iterate for a while, then you're not getting to see the current frontier of abilities.(EG if you're just using models to do general knowledge Q&A, then sure, there's only so much better you can get at that and models tapered off there long ago. But the vision is to use agents to perform a substantial fraction of white-collar work, there are well-defined research programmes to get there, and there is stead progress.)

o1 was something like 16-18 months ago. o3 was kinda better, and GPT 5 was considered a flop because it was basically just o3 again.I've used all the latest models in tools like Claude code and codex, and I guess I'm just not seeing the improvement? I'm not even working on anything particularly technically complex, but I still have to constantly babysit these things.Where are the long-running tasks? Cursor's browser that didn't even compile? Claude's C compiler that had gcc as an oracle and still performs worse than gcc without any optimizations? Yeah I'm completely unimpressed at this point given the promises these people have been making for years now. I'm not surprised that given enough constraints they can kinda sorta dump out some code that resembles something else in their training data.

Eisenhower prophesied when he left office, there is now a permanent power establishment of admirals, generals and corporate CEO's, up against whom us average poor bastards are completely outclassed, although Ike didn't put it quite that way. We are all supposed to keep tranquil and allow it to go on, even though, because of the data revolution, it becomes every day less possible to fool any of the people any of the time. If our world survives, the next great challenge to watch out for will come - you heard it here first - when the curves of research and development in artificial intelligence, molecular biology and robotics all converge. Oboy. It will be amazing and unpredictable, and even the biggest of brass, let us devoutly hope, are going to be caught flat-footed. It is certainly something for all good Luddites to look forward to if, God willing, we should live so long. Meantime, as Americans, we can take comfort, however minimal and cold, from Lord Byron's mischievously improvised song, in which he, like other observers of the time, saw clear identification between the first Luddites and our own revolutionary origins.

Then next month, of course, latest thing becomes last thing, and suddenly it's again obvious that actually it didn't quite work.It's like running on a treadmill towards a dangling carrot or something. It's simultaneously always here in front of our faces but also not here in actual hand, obviously.The tools are good and improving. They work for certain things, some of the time, with various need for manual stewarding in the hands of people who really know what they're doing. This is real.But it remains an absolutely epic leap from here to the idea that writing code per se is a skill nobody needs any more.More broadly, I don't even really understand what that could possibly mean on a practical level, as code is just instructions for what the software should do. You can express instructions on a higher level, and tooling keeps making that more and more possible (AI and otherwise), but in the end what does it mean to abstract fully away from the instruction in the detail? It seems really clear that will never be able to result in getting software that does what you want in a precise way rather than some probabilistic approximation which must be continually corrected.I think the real craft of software such that there is one is constructing systems of deterministic logic flows to make things happen in precisely the way we want them to. Whatever happens to tooling, or what exactly we call code or whatever, that won't change.

I have encountered a lot of people say it will be better in six months, and every six months It has been.I have also seen a few predictions that say 'in a year or two they will be able to do a job completely. I am sceptical, but  I would say such claims are rare.  Dario Amodei has been about the only prominent voice that I have encountered that puts such abilities on a very short timeframe, and he still points to more than a year.The practical use of AI has certainly increased a lot in the last six months.So I guess what I'm asking is more specifics on what you feel was claimed, by whom, and how much did they fall short?Without that supporting evidence you could just be being annoyed by the failure of claims that exist in your imagination.

Reminds me of another ""just around the corner"" promise...[0]I think it is one thing for the average person to buy into the promises but I've yet to understand why that happens here. Or why that happens within our community of programmers. It is one thing for non-experts to fall for obtuse speculative claims, but it is another for experts. I'm excited for autonomous vehicles, but in 2016 is was laughable to think they're around the corner and only 10 years later does such a feat seem to start looking like it's actually a few years away.Why do we only evaluate people/claims on their hits and not their misses? It just encourages people to say anything and everything, because eventually one will be right. It's 6 months away because eventually it will actually be 6 months away. But is it 6 months away because it is actually 6 months away or because we want it to be? I thought the vibe coder's motto is ""I just care that it works."" Honestly, I think that's the problem. Everyone care's about if it works or not and that's the primary concern of all sides of the conversation here. So is it 6 months away because it is 6 months away or is it 6 months away because you've convinced yourself it is 6 months away. You got good reasons for believing that, you got the evidence, but evidence for a claim is meaningless without comparing to evidence that counters the claim.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_predictions_for_autono...

I often have one programming project I do myself, on the side, and recently I've been using coding agents. Their average ability is no doubt impressive for what they are. But they also make mistakes that not even a recent CS graduate with no experience would ever make (e.g. I asked the agent for it's guess as to why a test is failing; it suggested it might be due to a race condition with an operation that is started after the failing assertion). As a lead, if someone on the team is capable of making such a mistake even once, then that person can't really code, regardless of their average performance (just as someone who sometimes lands a plane in the wrong airport or even crashes without their being a catastrophich condition outside their control can't really fly regardless of their average performance). ""This is more complicated than we though and would take longer than we expected"" is something you hear a lot, but ""sorry, I got confused"" is something you never hear. A report by Anthropic last week said, ""Claude will work autonomously to solve whatever problem I give it. So it's important that the task verifier is nearly perfect, otherwise Claude will solve the wrong problem."" Yeah, that's not something a team lead faces. I wish the agent could work like a team of programmers and I would be doing my familiar role of a project lead, but it doesn't.The models do some things well. I believe that programming is an interesting mix of inductive and deductive thinking (https://pron.github.io/posts/people-dont-write-programs), and the models have the inductive part down. They can certainly understand what a codebase does faster than I can. But their deductive reasoning, especially when it comes to the details, is severely lacking (e.g. I asked the agent to document my code. It very quickly grasped the design and even inferred some important invariants, but when it saw an `assert` in one subroutine it documented it as guarding a certain invariant. The intended invariant was correct, it just wasn't the one the assertion was guarding). So I still (have to) work as a programmer when working with coding assistants, even if in a different way.I've read about great successes at using coding agents in ""serious"" software, but what's common to those cases is that the people using the agents (Mitchell Hashimoto, antirez) are experts in the respective codebase. At the other end of the spectrum, people who aren't programmers can get some cool programs done, but I've yet to see anything produced in this way (by a non programmer) that I would call serious software.I don't know what the future will bring, but at the moment, the craft isn't dead. When AI can really program, i.e. the experience is really like that of a team lead, I don't think that the death of programming would concern us, because once they get to that point, the agents will also likely be able to replace the team lead. And middle management. And the CTO, the CFO, and the CEO, and most of the users.

It gets hard to compare AI to humans. You can ask the AI to do things you would never ask a human to do, like retry 1000 times until it works, or assign 20 agents to the same problem with slightly different prompts. Or re-do the entire thing with different aesthetics.

And the problem isn't even the Junior Zoomer devs running circles around seniors. It's the CTO or Engineering VP himself disappearing for a few months and single-handedly consolidating a handful of products into a full rewrite for the company, excluding most of their engineering team from the process, and then laying them off after.The problem is the CEO pretending to be an engineer and thinking they know better because they can write English prompts and spit out a hideous prototype.The problem is Product Owners using LLMs to ""write code"" while their engineering team does zero human review before merging it, because their AI tooling was made solely responsible for code quality. If something's broken, just prompt a sloppy fix full of hidden performance and security bugs that the automated code review step missed.If you think this is hyperbole, I was recently laid off from a company that did exactly the above.Then in 2027, it will be product owners replacing the entire engineering team, including the CTO, because they made their system too reliable to justify their employment, while the ""thinkers"" get to build the product, engineers be damned.People with real skills they acquired over a lifetime are no longer shaping business. Reckless efficiency towards being average will rule the day.

I found I got bigger bucks - and had more fun - the better I got at avoiding rat-hole problems in the first place.* My entire journey creating software from ~1983 to ~2020 was about making a thing that solved someone's problem better, cheaper or faster - and, on a good day, we managed all three at once.

I could not be having a better time.I liked coding! It was fun! But I mourned because I felt like I would never get out 1% of the ideas in my head. I was too slow, and working on shit in my free time just takes so much, is so hard, when there's so little fruitful reward at the end of a weekend.But I can make incredible systems so fast. This is the craft I wanted to be doing. I feel incredibly relieved, feel such enormous weigh lifted, that maybe perhaps some of my little Inland Empire that lives purely in my head might perhaps make it's way to the rest of the world, possibly.Huge respect for all the sadness and mourning. Yes too to that. But I cannot begin to state how burdened and sad I felt, so unable to get the work done, and it's a total flip, with incredible raw excitement and possibility before me.That said, software used to reward such obsessive deep following pursuit, such leaning into problems. And I am very worried, long term, what happens to the incredible culture of incredible people working really hard together to build amazing systems.

And you still need plans.Can you write a plan for a sturdy house, verify that it meets the plan that your nails went all the way in and in the right places?You sure can.Your product person, your directors, your clients might be able to do the same thing, it might look like a house but its a fire hazard, or in the case of most LLM generated code a security one.The problem is that we moved to scrum and agile, where your requirements are pantomime and postit notes if your lucky, interpretive dance if you arent. Your job is figuring out how to turn that into something... and a big part of what YOU as an engineer do is tell other people ""no thats dumb"" without hurting their feelings.IF AI coding is going to be successful then some things need to change: Requirements need to make a come back. GOOD UI needs to make a comeback (your dark pattern around cancelation, is now going to be at odds with an agent). Your hide the content behind a login or a pay wall wont work any more because again, end users have access too... the open web is back and by force. If a person can get in, we have code that can get in now.There is a LOT of work that needs to get done, more than ever, stop looking back and start looking forward, because once you get past the hate and the hype there is a ton of potential to right some of the ill's of the last 20 years of tech.

It's not that impressive that Claude wrote a C compiler when GitHub has the code to a bunch of C compilers (some SOTA) just sitting there.I'm using an LLM to write a compiler in my spare time (for fun) for a ""new"" language.  It feels more like a magical search engine than coding assistant.  It's great for bouncing ideas from, for searching the internet without the clutter of SEO optimized sites and ads, it's definitely been useful, just not that useful for code.Like, I have used some generated code in a very low stakes project (my own Quickshell components) and while it kind of worked, eventually I refactored it myself into 1/3 of the lines it produced and had to squash some bugs.It's probably good enough for the people who were gluing React components together but it still isn't on the level where I'd put any code it produces into production anywhere I care about.

I don't mourn or miss anything. No more then the previous generation mourned going from assembly to high level languages.The reason why programming is so amazing is getting things done. Seeing my ideas have impact.What's happening is that I'm getting much much faster and better at writing code. And my hands feel better because I don't type the code in anymore.Things that were a huge pain before are nothing now.I didn't need to stay up at night writing code. I can think. Plan. Execute at a scale that was impossible before. Alone I'm already delivering things that were on the roadmap for engineering months worth of effort.I can think about abstractions, architecture, math, organizational constraints, product. Not about what some lame compiler thinks about my code.And if someone that's far junior to me can do my job. Good. Then we've empowered them and I've fallen behind. But that's not at all the case. The principals and faculty who are on the ball are astronomically more productive than juniors.

fact of the matter is, being able to churn out bash oneliners was objectively worth $100k/year, and now it just isnt anymore. knowing the C++ STL inside-out was also worth $200k/year, now it has very questionable utility.a lot of livelihoods are getting shaken up as programmers get retroactively turned into the equivalent of librarians, whose job is to mechanically index and fetch cognitive assets to and from a digital archive-brain.

Right now I can think of very few white-collar jobs that I would feel comfortable training 4+ years for (let alone spending money or taking on debt to do so). It is far from a guarantee that almost any 4-year degree you enroll in today will have any value in four years. That has basically never before been true, even in tech. Blue collar jobs are clearly safer, but I wouldn't say safe. Robotics is moving fast too.I really can't imagine the social effects of this reality being positive, absent massive and unprecedented redistribution of the wealth that the productivity of AI enables.

There appears to be no obvious plausible link between the SANs other than very obvious lack of plausibility to each website.

Most domains don't include any valid contact or business information, even a supposed restaurant where you'd want people to find your location easily!There does appear to be heavy use of Google Firebase, and many of the sites share the same IP address(es) for hosting.

“If I can generate a book in a day, and you need six months to write a book, who's going to win the race?”That strange quote is from an extraordinary New York Times article about “Coral Hart,” the pseudonym of a Cape Town, South Africa-based writer granted anonymity by the Times to talk about her use of AI to mass produce “more than 200 romance novels,” which she then sells on Amazon without disclosing that they're the products of AI models like Claude and Grok, and in so doing she has pulled in six-figures, she says, off of about 50,000 sales.

The person known as Hart allowed what seems to be a real photograph of her, smiling face and all, to be used by the Times, apparently in service of a side hustle teaching people how to use AI to manufacture their own novels, courses she markets under the “Hart” name. 

Hart, the story says, “requested anonymity” for what only sound like reasons related to professional expediency. She apparently works as some kind of coach, and has some unnamed role in publishing—work she performs under her real name. But she “fears that revealing her A.I. use would damage her business for that work.”

With her face now out there, how anonymous can she possibly be?

The Times' Alexandra Alter writes that during a Zoom conversation with Hart some unnamed A.I. program churned instructions into a full novel over the course of 45 minutes. The article also claims that through Hart's teaching business, Plot Prose, she's working on a proprietary piece of software that can “generate a book based on an outline in less than an hour, and costs between $80 and $250 a month.” It sounds a great deal like the same piece of software Hart demoed directly to the Times. The PlotProse website advertises something called “The PlotProse Skip-the-Draft Package,” claiming to produce novels that are 90% complete and “fully packaged for publication.”

The section on the “February Launchpad” from PlotProse costs $300, and it's described as a mentorship program “designed to take you from a single idea to a fully published author with a three-book catalogue.” Participants who AI-generate their three books, can expect, “instant momentum in the market,” and “a complete, repeatable production and launch blueprint that allows you to keep scaling up your business in the following months.”

The package, the site claims, “eliminates the blank page, replacing months of drafting with a data-validated manuscript and a clear, proprietary roadmap for rapid publication.” The Times' Alter writes that Hart doesn't disclose the use of AI, even to readers, because Hart claims that “there's still a strong stigma around the technology.”

Hart's odd choice to reveal her face but not her name extends to YouTube as well. Late last year she appeared on the video podcast “Brave New Bookshelf” to talk about what she was at the time calling an experiment to write under 20 different pseudonyms (“Coral Hart” is apparently a discontinued pseudonym when it comes to book bylines). 

In the video, she occasionally slips up and refers to herself and her pseudonyms as “we.”

“When I say ‘we' it's just me and those personalities of pen names, right? My AI pen names are run just by me. That was part of the experiment. See if I could substitute volume of publishing as opposed to throwing ad money into something. So far the answer is yes. I'm still putting out quality books. I just learned how to do it fast and stack and juggle a lot.”

It strikes me that making six-figures per year is both ambitious in a way, and in another way, small potatoes. Even if you have zero qualms whatsoever about secretly selling people AI-generated text, generating millions of words to any sort of specifications at all—even loose ones—and then marketing them on Amazon still involves a whole lot of mouse clicks or iPad finger taps or whatever the case may be. And at the same time, you can almost certainly scam people out of crypto with much less effort and a whole lot more monetary reward.

This has to be one of the stranger cases of doing it for the love of the game I've seen. Whoever Coral Hart is, she doesn't exactly seem greedy in terms of wanting money. She seems like she truly just wants a decent income in exchange for turning the crank on a giant text meat grinder all day long.

According to Bloomberg's Apple scoop-getter Mark Gurman, the iPhone 17e “is due imminently.” The “e” means, as you know, it's the cheaper, entry-level iPhone in the latest numerical series, and Gurman says it's going to set buyers back $599—the same price as the current bottom-end phone from Apple, the iPhone 16e.  Tom's Guide has previously written about rumors that the release will be Thursday, February 19, exactly one year after the release of the iPhone 16e. The 17e will reportedly receive the same A19 chip as the iPhone 17, a formidable processor with better specs—I'm willing to bet—than your laptop: a 6-core CPU configuration and a 6-core GPU configuration. Last year when it came out, it was the absolute top of the line in smartphone processors, but it may soon be surpassed in performance by the Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 in phones like the Samsung Galaxy S26 when those become real.  The iPhone 17e will also, Gurman says, feature additional upgrades in the form of the the newest Apple cellular modem and the newest connectivity chip (presumably meaning the C1X and N1).

It may be just four months or so away, but much of The Mandalorian and Grogu, the first Star Wars film since 2019's The Rise of Skywalker, remains shrouded in mystery. But after we got a very broad teaser that leaned more on Star Wars familiarity than telling us what's up with our titular heroes, people would've expected that our next look at the film would at least give us a little more of an inkling about what's pulling Din and his ward back into the fight. But don't expect that just yet.

During the Super Bowl, Lucasfilm released the latest teaser for The Mandalorian and Grogu. Set after the events of the streaming series' third season, the movie follows up on Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) and the youngling Grogu after their retirement to Navarro in the wake of the re-liberation of Mandalore, and Din's newest job working as a freelance agent of the burgeoning New Republic. This teaser, however? It's still vibes, it's just this time it's in the snow.

The new teaser comes after practically months of silence since the initial trailer, a tactic that The Mandalorian is more than familiar with, maintaining an air of secrecy for as much as possible in the run-up to each season's debut on Disney+. Even as the new film draws even closer, it looks like we're still going to have to wait and see what makes this film worth heading out to theaters for instead of a fourth season on Disney+.

The Mandalorian and Grogu, which also stars Sigourney Weaver as New Republic officer Colonel Ward, and Jeremy Allen White as Clone Wars character Rotta the Hutt, hits theaters May 22.

The Super Mario Galaxy Movie promotion continues with a Super Bowl ad reminding everyone it's just months away and going to hit big when it comes. How big are we talking? If this teaser and the first trailer are any indication, Nintendo and Illumination are thinking as big as the universe.

After showing off Yoshi in the last trailer, we got a short tease that puts a spotlight on the film's action and new worlds. The first is a riff on the T-Rex moment from Super Mario Odyssey, with Yoshi and Toad trying to protect baby versions of Luigi and Mario from a massive dino. But Universal also released a broader advert over the weekend that gives us a bit more.

Like the ad says, there's a big galaxy out there, and if you thought the last movie was good-looking, Illumination's really upped their game for the sequel. We've previously seen the film's version of the Sand Kingdom (from Super Mario Odyssey), where Mario and Luigi find Luigi. This new spot gives us another new location in a massive cyberpunk city Peach and Toad visited that also includes a bar full of classic Mario enemies.

Finally, we get a look at Yoshi doing what he's best known for: swallowing enemies and spitting them out as eggs. Seeing it in movie form is kind of gross and funny, and your kids are sure to love it when The Super Mario Galaxy movie hits theaters on Wednesday, April 1.

Illumination doesn't just have another Super Mario movie hitting theaters this year. The Minions are back, and for their third solo movie, they're making more trouble by calling in some big friends.

Directed by Pierre Coffin—who not only voices them, but directed both the first film and the Despicable Me trilogy from whence they came—Minions & Monsters sees a collection of the yellow guys trying to make a play at being Hollywood actors. They're crushing it, but they've also got dreams of getting behind the camera and making a monster movie. But how to get a monster? Well, there's always using a powerful arcane spellbook to summon one!

Said monster, who looks like a tiny Cthulu, isn't quite what they're looking for. The good news is, he's got some bigger buddies of his own to call on to. As for the bad news…well, these new monsters are bigger and more suited to wreaking havoc, which they love doing. So it now falls on the Minions to save the world since they're the ones who started all this, and maybe make the movie of their dreams along the way.

Look for (or run away from) Minions & Monsters to storm into theaters on July 1.

Intel is reportedly preparing to launch its Arrow Lake refresh, aka 16th Gen, next month with at least three SKUs present at launch. One of those is the Core Ultra 250K Plus, the successor to the existing Core Ultra 245K, with a bumped-up core config and tuned clock speeds. While we've seen benchmarks leaks for other ARL-R chips before, the 250K Plus has just appeared for the first time on Geekbench.

 




This processor ended up scoring 3,113 points in the single-core test and walked away with 15,251 points in the multi-core test. Those are some pretty solid numbers and in line with what we expect from a new Core Ultra 5 desktop processor. For some reason, Geekbench's CPU database doesn't include the 245K so we don't have a direct point of comparison, but we can still search for individual runs on the platform.

Most of the 245K results listings show a single-core score under 3,000, but multi-core is almost always between 17,000-18,000, which means the Core Ultra 250K Plus tested here was ahead in one place but trailing in the other. This leaked run was conducted on an Asus Prime Z890-P WIFI motherboard with 32GB of RAM, and the processor boosted up to 5.3 GHz during testing. That lines up with the previous leak from last year.

The Core Ultra 250K Plus is supposed to be an 18-core processor with 6 P-cores and 12 E-cores (up from 6P+8E on 245K). It features a 100 MHz increase in both of those core boost clocks, along with 100 MHz decrease in the E-core base clock speeds. Like other Arrow Lake refresh chips, it has support for native DDR5-7200 and will use the existing LGA 1851 socket, yet there are new motherboards planned.

This will be Intel's last hurrah in the desktop segment until Nova Lake is expected to debut at the end of this year, marking a true next-gen leap similar to what Panther Lake has done on mobile. Recently, prices and embargo dates for these ARL-R chips leaked out and showed a very enticing picture, while confirming that the Core Ultra 9 SKU is dead for this generation.

Taiwan's government has rejected calls from U.S. officials to shift a large portion of semiconductor manufacturing to America, stating that relocating 40% of the island's chip production is not feasible, reports Reuters. The authorities expect companies like TSMC and UMC to keep expanding their production capacity on the island, even though TSMC is now actively expanding overseas and other countries are looking for the onshoring of chipmaking.

Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun said in an interview with Taiwanese television station CTS that she had clearly told the U.S. government that Taiwan's semiconductor ecosystem cannot simply be transferred elsewhere. The semiconductor sector will continue expanding domestically, while overseas investments — including those that TSMC makes in its U.S. production capacity — will proceed only alongside continued growth at home.

According to Cheng, Taiwan's overall semiconductor capacity — including existing fabs as well as future projects — is expected to exceed investments made in the United States or any other country.

The comments are a response to the recent statements by U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who said that concentrating a large portion of global semiconductor production close to China represented a strategic vulnerability. He also indicated that the goal of the U.S. government is to increase the country's share of the market of leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing to 40% in three years, by the end of President Trump's current term.

How that can be possible, given the fact that it takes three years to build a fab in the U.S. and then about a year to ramp it, is something Lutnick did not disclose. Yet he warned that if such goals are not achieved, tariffs on Taiwan-made goods could potentially increase to as much as 100%.

In earlier remarks, Lutnick also described a scenario in which leading-edge semiconductor production could be split roughly evenly between Taiwan and the United States, which indicates that the U.S. government has a fairly flexible position when it comes to actual market share numbers.

By contrast, Taiwanese officials reiterated that there are no plans to relocate the island's science parks, which form the core of its semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem, and are indispensable parts of the country's so-called silicon shield. Nonetheless, Taiwan authorities have no problems with TSMC expanding overseas as long as its most advanced technologies remain in Taiwan.

AI.com bought its way onto the biggest advertising stage in the world on Sunday night, running a fourth-quarter Super Bowl ad spot that told tens of millions of sports fans worldwide to head to the site and create a handle. Hyped-up viewers arrived in droves, and then the site crashed.

Within minutes of the ad airing, users across social platforms reported that AI.com was either unreachable or stuck in failed sign-up loops, turning what was meant to be the site's big launch moment into an unexpected stress test that failed right before the eyes of millions. The company soon restored its service, but first impressions count.

In a post on X.com, co-founder and CEO Kris Marszalek, best known as the CEO of Crypto.com, said that the company had “prepared for scale, but not for THIS,” later attributing the disruption to external factors outside the company's control. Marszalek later wrote that the website was “hitting Google rate limits (which are at their absolute global maximum).”

That excuse might sound like your typical tech bro attempt to pass the buck to somebody else, but there's some plausibility to his claim given how AI.com's onboarding works. At launch, the site funnels new users through a single “continue with Google” authentication option. Once millions of users suddenly arrived and began attempting to create their AI agents, Google may have begun throttling requests, effectively making the site unusable.

For a company that reportedly spent $70 million to secure the AI.com domain — a level of investment that suggests it's a business that wants to establish itself as a foundational platform — it's arguably inexcusable for its first mass-market test to expose a launch stack that had zero redundancy or meaningful margin for error. When the single point of failure gave way in the form of throttled Google authentication requests, it was lights out.

AI.com is selling itself as a way to create personal AI agents that can execute tasks across apps and operate with verifying levels of access depending on subscription tier. That's an ambitious promise, and that ultimately falls flat when the company behind it can't even get the basics like user authentication squared away right out of the gate.

According to Adweek, AI accounted for 23% of ads shown during this year's Super Bowl — a grim statistic for those of us who are fed up with the force-feeding.

Among patients with haematologic malignancies, faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was associated with an effective decolonisation of carbapenem‑resistant Pseudomonas, was well tolerated, and was linked to fewer severe infections shortly after treatment.

""FMT offers a compelling supportive intervention aimed at MDRO [multidrug-resistant organisms] decolonization, potentially severing the link between gut colonization and subsequent infection in vulnerable cohorts. The procedure is feasible in patients with hematologic diseases, with a favourable safety profile and minimal adverse events,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Aneta Nowicka, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznań, Poland. It was published online on January 31, 2026, in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases.

This study was limited by its retrospective design, the small sample size, and the lack of a control group. Heterogeneity in diagnoses, immune status, and antibiotic exposure among patients potentially confounded the assessment of FMT efficacy, and the absence of digital pharmacologic records prevented a detailed analysis of individual antibiotic exposure.

This study did not receive any grant from any funding agency. The authors reported having no competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have influenced the work.

In adults with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), higher serum levels of interferon (IFN) alfa were linked to greater disease activity and autoantibody positivity; however, IFN-gamma showed no such link, and neither IFN was associated with cardiovascular or metabolic risk characteristics.

""Type I IFN-α [alfa], but not type II IFN-γ [gamma], is significantly associated with seropositivity and disease activity in RA. Accordingly, serum IFN-α levels may serve as a reliable biomarker for monitoring disease activity in this patient population,"" the authors of the study concluded.

This study was led by Fuensanta Gómez-Bernal, Hospital Universitario de Canarias, Tenerife, Spain. It was published online on January 29, 2026, in Rheumatology.

The cross‑sectional design limited the ability to establish cause-and-effect relationships. The study lacked a control group with healthy control individuals. Researchers did not assess IFN gene expression signatures.

This study was funded by a grant from Instituto de Salud Carlos III and co-funded by the European Union.

The effect of body fat on brain health may depend not only on the amount of fat an individual has but also on where that fat is stored, new research revealed.

While previous research has established a link between obesity and brain and cognitive health, particularly in people with higher ratios of visceral fat, the current study focused on the risks associated with specific fat distribution patterns, said co-senior author Kai Liu, MD, PhD, associate professor in radiology at the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University in Xuzhou, China.

The study leveraged MRI and latent profile analysis (LPA), a modeling technique used to identify unobserved subgroups (latent profiles) within a population, to quantify fat in various body compartments, especially internal organs. The result was “a classification system that's data-driven instead of subjective,” Liu told Medscape Medical News.

“The data-driven classification unexpectedly discovered two previously undefined fat distribution types” that carried risks for the brain, he said. One was a pancreatic predominant profile. “This was surprising. Though a small organ with minimal total fat, pancreatic fat played a disproportionately important role in our system and defined the profile with the highest brain risk — a finding that somewhat overturned conventional understanding.”

“The other newly defined high-risk type — ‘skinny fat' — also surprised us,” he said. “It does not fit the traditional ‘very obese' image, yet it still showed strong associations with adverse brain outcomes.”

The study was published online in Radiology.

The researchers conducted a secondary analysis of prospective data from 25,997 participants (mean age, 55 years; 52% female) in the UK Biobank, including health records and MRI scans of the brain, heart, and abdomen.

Participants were included if they had complete data for BMI and nine MRI-derived fat quantification variables from cardiac and abdominal imaging: hepatic proton density fat fraction, pancreatic proton density fat fraction, abdominal fat ratio, muscle fat infiltration, total abdominal adipose tissue index, weight-to-muscle ratio, abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue volume, visceral adipose tissue volume, and mean estimated area of pericardial fat.

Differences in brain volume, white matter properties, cognition, and the risk for neurologic disorders were analyzed across profiles and relative to a benchmark lean profile, and analyses were stratified by sex.

LPA identified six profiles of body fat distribution in both sexes. Of these, compared with the lean profile, “pancreatic predominant” and “skinny fat” profiles were most associated with extensive gray matter atrophy, accelerated brain aging, cognitive decline, and an increased risk for neurological disease, according to the authors. The risks were present in both men and women, with small variations between the sexes.

Specifically, individuals with “pancreatic predominant” distribution patterns showed a proton density fat fraction — an MRI marker that provides a precise estimation of fat concentration in tissue — of around 30% in the pancreas.

“This level is about two to three times higher than that of other fat distribution categories, and it can be up to six times higher than that of lean individuals with low overall fat,” Liu said. “Additionally, this group tends to have a higher BMI and overall body fat load.”

Yet these individuals didn't have significantly more pronounced liver fat than those with other profiles. Thus, high pancreatic fat accompanied by relatively low liver fat emerged as a “distinct, clinically overlooked phenotype,” he said.

“In practice, we routinely diagnose ‘fatty liver,' but our findings suggest that — from a neurological risk perspective — elevated pancreatic fat should be acknowledged as a potentially higher-risk imaging marker,” he said.

In individuals with the “skinny fat” profile, fat tends to be more concentrated in the abdomen. “This type does not fit the traditional image of a very obese person, as its actual average BMI ranks only fourth among all categories,” he noted. “The increase is perhaps more in fat proportion. Therefore, if one feature best summarizes this profile, it would be an elevated weight-to-muscle ratio, especially in male individuals.”

The study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the Construction Project of High Level Hospital of Jiangsu Province, the Qinglan Project of Jiangsu Province of China, and the Key Research and Development Project of Xuzhou. Liu reported having no conflicts.

In a prospective cohort study, the ultrasound-based International Ovarian Tumour Analysis (IOTA) Assessment of Different Neoplasias in the adnEXa (ADNEX) model at a threshold of 10% demonstrated superior sensitivity than the current standard Risk of Malignancy Index 1 in detecting ovarian cancer in premenopausal women.

""Primary care implementation could potentially improve survival through earlier detection in symptomatic premenopausal women, but this requires further research alongside investment in sonographer training and quality assurance,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Sudha Sundar, PhD, Pan-Birmingham Gynaecological Cancer Centre, Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust, Birmingham, England. It was published online on January 29, 2026, in The BMJ.

The recruitment aligned with UK census patterns comprising mainly White patients; therefore, the results had potentially limited applicability to people of different ethnicities. The decision to restrict recruitment to presurgical patients following the observation of low ovarian cancer prevalence led to potential systematic differences between the two cohorts. Additionally, not scheduling additional hospital visits for transvaginal IOTA ultrasound during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in missing data, particularly for ultrasound variables.

Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) is a necrotizing small-vessel vasculitis that can be difficult to recognize due to variable and often subtle early manifestations. Delayed diagnosis may lead to progressive organ damage, underscoring the importance of identifying key clinical patterns that prompt timely evaluation.

MPA can present with constitutional symptoms (eg, fever, fatigue, weight loss, arthralgia/myalgia) plus evidence of small-vessel organ involvement, most commonly affecting the kidneys. It is characterized by “necrotizing inflammation without clinical or pathological evidence of granulomatous involvement.” The presence of pulmonary capillaritis without granulomatous inflammation in the upper respiratory tract can help differentiate MPA from other antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)–associated vasculitides. Renal manifestations of MPA can include pauci-immune glomerulonephritis, microscopic hematuria, proteinuria, and urinary casts; severity ranges from asymptomatic urinary abnormalities to progressive renal dysfunction.

Isolated upper airway disease with chronic sinusitis is more typical of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), which is associated with granulomatous inflammation and a higher frequency of sinonasal and upper airway involvement compared with MPA.

Intermittent claudication of the lower extremities most likely suggests peripheral arterial disease rather than MPA.

Learn more about the presentation of MPA.

Cutaneous small-vessel involvement is common in MPA and might present as palpable lesions, commonly on the lower extremities. Other cutaneous manifestations, including livedo reticularis, urticaria, nodules, and ulcers accompanied by necrosis, might also occur.

Persistent asthma with nasal polyposis is not characteristic of MPA; it is more often seen in eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA).

Large-joint erosive arthritis is more likely suggestive of inflammatory arthritis rather than MPA, while jaw claudication with transient visual loss is typical of giant cell arteritis.

Learn more about the symptoms of MPA.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage can occur in MPA and can present with dyspnea, hemoptysis, and new pulmonary infiltrates, reflecting underlying pulmonary capillaritis. This manifestation may occur with or without concurrent renal involvement. Pulmonary nodules can be seen with MPA, but cavitary nodules are comparatively more often associated with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA).

Pleural effusion and lobar consolidation from bacterial pneumonia may occur in systemic illness but are not characteristic pulmonary manifestations of MPA.

Learn more about the clinical presentation of MPA.

MPA is an ANCA-associated small-vessel vasculitis commonly associated with anti-MPO positivity. MPO-ANCA best supports the diagnosis of MPA and helps distinguish it from other inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. 

Anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies and ANA are associated with connective tissue diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and are generally not specific for MPA.

Low complement levels more likely suggest immune complex–mediated vasculitis. 

Learn more about the workup for MPA.

A positive tissue biopsy strongly supports the diagnosis of vasculitis and, when feasible, is recommended to assist in establishing a new diagnosis of MPA. Tissue biopsy can help evaluate disease activity and provide prognostic and management information for MPA as well. 

Tissue biopsy usually does not replace serologic testing; its primary role is not to guide initial immunosuppressive treatment selection based on histologic subtype, and it should not delay initiation of therapy when MPA is strongly suspected.

Regulatory applications for upadacitinib as a treatment for non-segmental vitiligo in adults and adolescents have been submitted to the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, the manufacturer, AbbVie, announced in a statement on February 3.

The applications for the expanded indication for the oral JAK inhibitor included data from the phase 3 Viti-Up studies in adults and adolescents aged 12 years or older with non-segmental vitiligo eligible for systemic therapy, according to the press release. In October 2025, the company announced results of the studies comparing 15 mg of upadacitinib once a day in 411 patients aged 12 years or older with non-segmental vitiligo and 203 on placebo. The co-primary endpoints were a 50% reduction in the Total Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (T-VASI 50) and a 75% reduction in the Facial Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (F-VASI 75) from baseline to 48 weeks.

At 48 weeks in study 1, 19.4% of patients on treatment achieved T-VASI 50 and 25.2% achieved F-VASI 75 vs 5.9% of those on placebo in both studies. At 48 weeks in study 2, 21.5% of those on upadacitinib achieved T-VASI 50, and 23.4% achieved F-VASI 75 vs 5.9% and 6.9% of those on placebo, respectively.

In both studies, safety was “generally consistent with that observed in approved indications,” and no new safety signals were noted, according to the October press release.

If approved, upadacitinib would be the first systemic medication for treating vitiligo, the company noted in the February release.

Additional phase 3 trials are underway evaluating upadacitinib in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, hidradenitis suppurativa, Takayasu arteritis, and alopecia areata, according to the press release. In the US, upadacitinib (Rinvoq) is currently approved for several indications, including psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis, and rheumatoid arthritis in adults. 

In 2022, topical ruxolitinib (Opzelura), a JAK inhibitor, was approved by the FDA for treating non-segmental vitiligo in people aged 12 years or older.

The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) has rejected the use of sotatercept for improving exercise capacity in adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in NHS Scotland. 

The regulator said the evidence did not demonstrate sufficient cost effectiveness compared with existing therapies.

The decision follows evidence showing that sotatercept improved exercise capacity compared with placebo, but this was not considered sufficient to support approval.

“The company's evidence around the cost effectiveness of the treatment compared to currently available options was not sufficient,” said SMC Chair Dr Scott Muir.

The charity Pulmonary Hypertension Association UK said the decision was disappointing but not unexpected.

For new and specialised drugs, “initial refusal was common,” the charity said. It added that sotatercept is an expensive therapy, “considerably higher than every other treatment that is currently available.” 

In August last year, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) reached the same conclusion for patients.

NICE said sotatercept should not be used to improve exercise capacity in adults in England with World Health Organization (WHO) functional class 2 or 3 PAH.

PAH is caused by the overexpression of vasoconstrictors, abnormal proliferation of endothelial and smooth muscle cells, and thrombosis. 

Sotatercept (Winrevair, MSD) is a first-in-class fusion protein that inhibits activin signalling. It is highly selective for activin-A, which is increased in PAH and drives abnormal vascular cell proliferation. By modulating these pathways, the drug aims to reduce pulmonary artery pressure and right ventricular dysfunction. 

“Rather than just opening up vessels, sotatercept works more directly on the underlying ‘problem proteins' that are causing the disease in the first place,” the Pulmonary Hypertension Association UK said.

The treatment is given every three weeks as a single subcutaneous injection.

The multicentre, double-blind phase 3 STELLAR trial compared sotatercept with placebo in adults who had WHO functional class 2 or 3 disease and were receiving stable background therapy.

At 24 weeks, patients receiving sotatercept had a statistically significant median improvement of 40.8 m in the 6-minute walk distance compared with placebo. The SMC considered this improvement clinically relevant but noted the evidence was limited to short-term outcomes.

Muir said the manufacturer did not submit a sufficiently robust economic analysis to support approval.

The company plans to resubmit evidence to the SMC.

NICE is currently conducting a further appraisal of the clinical and cost effectiveness of sotatercept for treating PAH.

The Australian government should follow the lead of the US and the EU by breaking down silos in digital health through legislation, argues the Australian Medical Association (AMA).

“Those of us who work in the public hospital system are constantly frustrated, certainly in Victoria, about the fact that various health record systems don't easily interact with each other,” Julian Rait, MBBS, the vice president of the AMA, told Medscape News Australia.

An AMA report released at the end of January calls on the government to pass legislation that forces digital health software providers to share data with each other. “Without a nationally agreed regulatory framework with defined regulations and standards — re-enforced and mandated by legislation — the promised benefits of interoperability will never be realized,” the report stated.

Australia's health software vendors have no legal obligation to share data with each other. This situation creates friction, additional work, and a risk for errors when patients move from one service provider to another, the AMA argued.

“There are instances where different departments within a hospital are using software which is incompatible with [that of] other departments,” stated the AMA report. “In an extreme example, clinical notes taken in the emergency department must be printed off and physically carried to other departments, including the intensive care unit , where these notes are then re-typed into the ICU software.”

Interoperability, the seamless flow of data between service providers, would facilitate faster healthcare delivery, reduce the duplication of work, create opportunities for research and improve data access for patients in rural and remote communities or those travelling between states, the AMA argued.

In 2016, the US enacted the 21st Century Cures Act, which prohibits information blocking: the unreasonable restriction of the exchange of health records. Similarly, the EU Data Act went into effect in September last year, establishing enforceable interoperability standards for the EU.

Australia should have penalties like those outlined in these Acts, and software vendors that don't comply with interoperability standards should face fines, the removal from government contracts, and licensing restrictions, the AMA argued.

So far, the Australian government has been taking a gentler approach. Since 2023, it has worked on building interoperability standards through the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) program called Sparked. Within this program, the government has collaborated with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, the Australian Digital Health Agency (ADHA), and the not-for-profit Health Level Seven Australia (HL7).

Everyone in the room at Sparked meetings (including clinicians, regulators, engineers, and business analysts) is in “ferocious agreement that we should share healthcare information,” Grahame Grieve, HL7's product director for the international FHIR upon which the Australian standards are based and a stakeholder in the Sparked program, told Medscape News Australia. But “there's ferocious disagreement about almost every technical detail,” he said.

Sparked is now starting to produce and publish interoperability standards for Australia. Most of the software vendors “have long been on board” with adopting these standards, but a few “haven't played ball,” said Grieve.

Beginning in July, the federal government will require that all pathology and imaging providers upload data to the My Health Record, a repository for health information that is managed by the federal government.

This “share by default” policy could soon be expanded to cover medicines, and doctors could be ineligible for Medicare benefits if they fail to upload the required data to the My Health Record, Peter O'Halloran, the chief digital officer at the ADHA, told Medscape News Australia.

This policy would provide immediate financial incentives for data sharing, whereas overseas interoperability legislation often leaves governments chasing down infringements long after they occur, by which time the consumer has already lost out, said O'Halloran.

Usage of the My Health Record surged following the announcement of the “share by default” legislation. The numbers of weekly clinician views of pathology and diagnostic imaging reports increased roughly threefold to fourfold between May 2023 and August 2025.

As of January, around 3.9 million pathology reports and 370,000 diagnostic imaging reports were being uploaded each week to the My Health Record. These numbers represent a 70% and a 139% increase since May 2023, respectively.

Health professionals have shared around 2 billion documents to the My Health Record since its inception in 2012. Around 4 in 10 specialists have used the platform. “We've seen a dramatic increase in the adoption of My Health Record by both consumers and clinicians,” said O'Halloran.

Once healthcare providers are forced to upload to the My Health Record, software providers will quickly fall in line with the new expectations of their customers and align with interoperability standards, argued O'Halloran.

But the government's focus on mandatory uploading to My Health Record is “deflecting the issue” and “a bit of a cop-out,” according to Rait. “The problem doesn't lie with the doctors, it lies with the systems,” he said.

My Health Record “is a bit clunky” and “doesn't really provide easy access to the full medical history,” said Rait. In emergencies, doctors don't “have all day to search through a pile of PDFs inside the My Health Record to find the history. We think there needs to be much better interoperability between health record systems so that it's easier to see and find information quickly.”

In some hospitals, however, the My Health Record is fully integrated into existing practice software, Clair Sullivan, MBBS (Hons), MD, an endocrinologist and the director of the Digital Health Centre at University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, told Medscape News Australia. Thanks to this integration, Sullivan can easily locate not only a patient's latest pathology report but also every test that has ever been uploaded to the My Health Record.

My Health Record puts patients in control of their own data, she added. “It empowers patients so they can see their results. They can track their results over time. They can also pick up things that we might miss.”

In an emergency, patients could use the 1800Medicare app on their phone to quickly bring up all their blood tests, prescriptions, and scans, said Sullivan. “That is an absolute, once-in-a-generation change in the way that health information is managed.”

The next step will be shifting My Health Record from PDFs to “fluid data” that can be aggregated and analyzed so we can learn from it, said Sullivan.

O'Halloran, Sullivan, and Rait reported having no relevant financial relationships. Grieve reported consulting for the Australian government and worked with the US government on FHIR.

In adults with moderate-to-severe fibromyalgia, duloxetine 120 mg offered greater quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and lower costs than amitriptyline. Pregabalin 450 mg also showed cost benefits over amitriptyline but was less effective than duloxetine 120 mg.

“This analysis demonstrates that optimal [fibromyalgia] treatment from an economic perspective differs from current prescribing patterns and formulary designs,” the authors wrote. “[The study] findings suggest that duloxetine 120 mg offers the greatest economic value for this patient population while highlighting the importance of accounting for societal costs in fibromyalgia treatment decisions. Clinical decisions should additionally consider adverse event profiles, patient comorbidities, and expected variability in treatment response,” they added.

This study was led by Sarah S. Downen, PharmD, MS, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida. It was published online on February 3, 2026, in JAMA Network Open.

A randomized clinical trial of 347 adult survivors of childhood cancer found that survivorship care plan-based counseling did not significantly reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor undertreatment compared to screening results alone. After 1 year, 26% of intervention participants and 30.2% of control participants showed improved risk factor control.

“In this randomized clinical trial of long-term survivors of childhood cancer, the addition of survivorship-based self-management counseling did not reduce undertreatment beyond simply providing CVD risk assessments to survivors and PCCs. Additional strategies to mitigate CVD risk in high-risk survivors should be examined in the future,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Eric J. Chow, MD, MPH, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle. It was published online on February 5 in JAMA Network Open.

According to the authors, while the trial did not meet its prespecified accrual goal, the degree of improvement seen in the control group suggests that even a fully accrued trial would not have had sufficient power to detect a significant difference. The study population was primarily drawn from a long-standing cohort that may not fully reflect the more racially and ethnically diverse contemporary pediatric cancer patient population. Additionally, trial eligibility was limited to English speakers, which excluded more vulnerable populations from minority racial and ethnic groups. The study was also geographically limited to participants living near selected metropolitan areas, potentially affecting generalizability to survivors with less access to primary care or those living in more rural areas.

This study received support through grants CA204378 and CA55727 from the National Institutes of Health and the Unravel Pediatric Cancer Foundation.

Lizette  Borreli

Listening to pink noise, commonly used in sound machines and apps marketed as sleep aids, was associated with a decrease in restorative REM sleep and worse overall sleep recovery than wearing earplugs, a new study showed.

Results of a small clinical trial showed that people exposed to continuous pink noise reduced REM sleep by nearly 20 minutes, while using earplugs actually restored deep sleep typically disrupted by environmental noise.

“REM sleep is important for memory consolidation, emotional regulation, and brain development, so our findings suggest that playing pink noise and other types of broadband noise during sleep could be harmful — especially for children whose brains are still developing and who spend much more time in REM sleep than adults,” lead investigator Mathias Basner, MD, PhD, professor in the Division of Sleep and Chronobiology, Department of Psychiatry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, said in a news release.

The study was published online on February 2 in Sleep.

Sleep cycles occur in multiple stages, including deep sleep and REM sleep. Deep sleep supports physical recovery, memory consolidation, and clearing of neurotoxins, while REM sleep aids emotional regulation, motor skill learning, and neurodevelopment.

Disruption of either stage has been associated with cognitive impairment, mood disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease. 

Since younger populations, including newborns and toddlers, spend a disproportionate amount of their sleep cycle in REM, disturbances in this stage may have neurologic consequences, impacting learning, memory, and emotional regulation, researchers wrote.

Broadband noise, such as pink, white, and brown noise, is widely used in ambient sound machines and sleep aid apps. White noise spreads sound evenly across all frequencies, producing a static-like sound. Pink noise emphasizes lower frequencies to produce a softer sound, such as the sound of rain, wind, or ocean waves. Brown noise boosts the lowest frequencies to create a deep, rumbling sound such as thunder.

Despite their popularity, evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of these sleep aids remains limited. Prior research has demonstrated that intermittent environmental noise, such as aircraft or traffic, can reduce deep sleep.

However, whether continuous broadband noise affects REM sleep architecture had remained unclear prior to this study.

The investigators conducted a randomized, controlled, crossover, polysomnographic sleep laboratory study at the Chronobiology and Isolation Laboratory in the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania between November 2023 and June 2024.

A total of 25 healthy adults aged 21-41 years were enrolled, including 13 women and 12 men. The cohort included approximately 60% White, 24% Black, 12% Asian, and 4% participants from other racial backgrounds. Participants reported no history of sleep disorders, hearing impairment, or prior use of noise sleep aids.

Participants completed seven consecutive overnight laboratory sessions, each with an 8-hour sleep opportunity. During different nights, participants were exposed to four experimental conditions: environmental aircraft noise alone, continuous pink noise at 50 dBA, combined environmental noise plus pink noise, and environmental noise combined with earplug use. Participants wore earplugs throughout the 8-hour sleep session during the environmental noise plus earplug condition.

Environmental aircraft noise was delivered intermittently at varying sound pressure levels designed to mimic real-world nighttime aircraft exposure (approximately 50-60 dBA). Pink noise was delivered continuously at 50 dBA, roughly equivalent to moderate rainfall.

It was not possible to fully blind participants because they could perceive acoustic conditions, which investigators acknowledged as an inherent limitation of acoustic sleep studies.

To assess the primary outcome, sleep architecture, the investigators used full polysomnography, including electroencephalography, electrooculography, and electromyography sensors worn overnight.

They used standardized sleep scoring criteria from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine to measure time spent in deep sleep, REM sleep, periods of wakefulness after falling asleep, and overall sleep fragmentation.

Secondary outcomes included subjective sleep quality, mood, alertness, and neurobehavioral performance measured each morning.

Aircraft noise alone reduced deep sleep by 23.4 minutes per night, compared with noise-free control nights. The use of earplugs restored16.9 minutes of deep sleep loss due to environmental noise, which represents a 72% recovery of noise-related reduction in deep sleep. 

Post hoc contrast analyses showed no statistically significant differences in measured sleep structure, mood, or alertness between earplug nights and control nights.

Pink noise alone reduced REM sleep by approximately 19 minutes compared with control conditions, but it did not significantly alter deep sleep. When combined, pink noise and aircraft noise shortened both deep and REM sleep significantly (P <.01) and increased time awake by 15 minutes.

Participants also reported lighter, more fragmented sleep with increased awakenings during exposure to pink or aircraft noise.

The findings suggest that continuous broadband noise may disrupt REM sleep, whereas earplugs may provide physiologic sleep protection without altering normal sleep architecture.

However, interpretation of the study's findings is limited by its small sample size and controlled laboratory setting. The inability to blind participants to sound exposure may also affect generalizability and potentially introduce reporting bias.

Among commonly used nonpharmacologic sleep aids, earplugs may offer greater protection of sleep architecture than pink noise, based on this study.

“… earplugs emerged as clearly superior in their efficacy to mitigate negative effects of intermittent EN [environmental noise] on sleep in comparison with constant PN [pink noise] exposure,” the investigators wrote.

They noted that broadband sounds are widely encountered in everyday environments, including household appliances such as fans and air conditioners. The investigators emphasized that more research is needed to determine safe acoustic exposure thresholds and optimal sound profiles for sleep.

“Future studies are needed to identify optimal noise color and level of broadband sounds before investigating effects of long-term exposure in the field,” they wrote.

Although sound machines are widely marketed as sleep aids, continuous broadband noise may unintentionally disrupt sleep stages that are most critical for neurodevelopment.

The investigators concluded, “While it is not clear how the findings of this study generalize to younger populations and chronic exposure scenarios, they caution against the use of BN [broadband noise] in newborns and toddlers until confirmatory studies are completed.”

About 60% of adults in the US (representing roughly 148 million) met FDA-approved indications for at least one novel cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) therapy, most often GLP-1 receptor agonists for weight management; many adults were eligible for more than one drug class.

“[The study] data highlight the large potential treatment-eligible population for CKM therapies and the substantial theoretical gains in CKM-related population health with widespread uptake of these therapies. Studies to systematically address barriers to equitable access for these therapies are urgently needed,” the researchers wrote.

This study was led by Louisa A. Mounsey, MD, of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. It was published online on January 28 in JAMA Cardiology.

Eligibility varied across samples because conditions such as chronic kidney disease were captured differently. FDA indication did not always mean a patient should get the drug, and the study could not account for individual contraindications. Baseline data came before these drugs were widely used, and the ambulatory data came from one region, so the study showed potential eligibility rather than real-world use and may not be generalized widely.

Several authors reported receiving grants and support from multiple sources including the National Institutes of Health; the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; and Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute. Multiple authors reported other financial ties such as receiving personal fees, speaker consultancy fees, and/or advisory board service with various pharmaceutical and healthcare companies including AstraZeneca, Novo Nordisk, and Bayer.

Children with hypertriglyceridemia treated with fenofibrate had lower levels of triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total cholesterol than those treated with omega-3 fatty acids.

“This study shows that fenofibrate is a safe and effective treatment for lowering TG [triglyceride] levels in children and adolescents with hypertriglyceridemia, while omega-3 supplementation may increase HDL-C [high-density lipoprotein cholesterol] levels. It addresses the limited options in pediatric lipid management, as fenofibrate enhances TG clearance through PPAR-[alpha] activation,” wrote the authors of the study.

The study was led by Setila Dalili, MD, Pediatric Diseases Research Center, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran. It was published online on February 3, 2026, in the Journal of Pediatric Health Care.

The sample size of the study was small, and it was conducted at a single center. The follow-up duration was short. The fixed dose of fenofibrate was not adjusted for weight, potentially affecting individual responses. Long-term safety data were lacking.

A significant discovery by Case Western Reserve University researchers could change how doctors treat two of the most devastating neurodegenerative diseases.

The team identified a link between gut bacteria and the deterioration of the brain in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). The researchers discovered that certain bacterial sugars cause immune responses that kill cells-and how to prevent it.

FTD mainly affects the brain's frontal and temporal lobes, causing changes in a person's personality, behavior and language. ALS primarily targets motor neurons, resulting in gradual muscle weakness and paralysis.

Most causes of ALS and FTD cases are unknown, although researchers have been examining several potential reasons, including genetics, environmental issues, brain injuries and diet.

The study, recently published in Cell Reports, solves a long-standing question about neurodegenerative diseases. The team discovered a molecular connection that explains why some people with specific genetic mutations acquire FTD and ALS and others don't.

We found that harmful gut bacteria produce inflammatory forms of glycogen (a type of sugar), and that these bacterial sugars trigger immune responses that damage the brain.""

Aaron Burberry, assistant professor, Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve School of Medicine

Burberry, the study's senior investigator, reported that 70% of the 23 ALS/FTD patients examined had dangerous glycogen levels. Of those without the brain diseases, only a third had high levels of glycogen.

The study has immediate implications for patient care by identifying new targets to treat ALS and FTD, while providing biomarkers to identify patients who might benefit from gut-targeted therapies.

This discovery paves the way for testing new treatments that break down harmful sugars in the gut, and it opens doors for developing drugs that work on the connection between the digestive system and the brain-potentially offering new hope for patients suffering from these devasting brain diseases.

Alex Rodriguez-Palacios, assistant professor in the Digestive Health Research Institute at the School of Medicine, said the team used its findings to then reduce the harmful sugars, which ""improved brain health and extended lifespan.""

Their discovery is particularly significant for what is known as C90RF72 mutation carriers-the most common genetic cause of ALS and FTD. The research explains why some people with the mutation develop the diseases while others don't, identifying gut bacteria as a key environmental trigger.

The university's Department of Pathology and Digestive Health Research Institute are leading neurovegetative disease research through their unique ability to conduct studies using germ-free mouse models-mice raised in completely sterile environments with no bacteria, allowing researchers to study exactly how specific gut bacteria affect brain diseases.

Fabio Cominelli, Distinguished University Professor and director of the Digestive Health Research Institute, oversees this program, which relies on an innovative ""cage-in-cage"" sterile housing system developed by Rodriguez-Palacios-a technical capability that few institutions worldwide possess and that made this discovery possible.

The design makes possible the large-scale microbiological studies necessary to understand the complex communication between the gut and brain-research that would be impossible with traditional methods that can only accommodate a few mice at a time, and a technical capability that few institutions worldwide possess.

""To understand when and why harmful microbial glycogen is produced, the team will next conduct larger studies surveying gut microbiome communities in ALS/FTD patients before and after disease onset,"" Burberry said. ""Clinical trials to determine whether glycogen degradation in ALS/FTD patients could slow disease progression are also supported by our findings and could begin in a year.""

Deaths due to synthetic opioids nitazenes have likely been underestimated by up to a third.

King's College London research, published today in Clinical Toxicology, sheds light on the UK's growing synthetic opioid problem.

The presence of nitazenes on the unregulated drug market has risen steeply in the last seven years – prompting UK and international bodies to issue public health warnings about their use.

Nitazenes are a class of synthetic opioids which can have potencies of up to 500 times that of heroin. They can be readily manufactured at low cost. These potent synthetic opioids were originally synthesised for use in humans as analgesics but their development was halted due to extreme potencies.

While the National Crime Agency (NCA) reported 333 fatalities linked to nitazenes in 2024, researchers believe that the number of deaths has been underreported as concerns have been raised by toxicologists regarding their stability in postmortem blood samples. This means they are likely being missed by postmortem toxicology tests.

Testing this theory, researchers used anesthetized animal models to find that on average only 14% of nitazene present at the time of overdose was present when tested under real-world pathology and toxicology sample handling conditions.

The team then used modeling to reveal a 33% excess in drug deaths in Birmingham in 2023, using data from the UK National Programme on Substance Use Mortality (NPSUM) based at King's College London. They believe that a credible explanation for at least some of these excess deaths may be due to the non-detection of nitazene that degraded prior to toxicology testing being performed. It typically takes around a month for blood samples to be analysed by toxicologists.

If nitazenes are degrading in post-mortem blood samples, then we are almost certainly undercounting the true number of deaths that they are causing. That means we're trying to tackle a crisis using incomplete data. When we don't measure a problem properly, we don't design the right interventions – and the inevitable consequence is that preventable deaths will continue.

Understanding how nitazenes degrade, and what they degrade into, is critical. If we can identify these breakdown products and where degradation is occurring, we will be able to detect deaths more accurately and respond more effectively. Better science leads to better surveillance, and better surveillance will save lives.

This research shows that the harm caused by nitazenes is likely being significantly underestimated. Because these drugs degrade in post-mortem blood, we may be missing up to a third of the deaths they are involved in, meaning public health responses are being designed and funded for only two-thirds of the real problem.

Behind this undercount are people dying suddenly from extremely potent opioids, families left without answers, and communities facing a growing but largely hidden toll.""

Small and dense but filled with vitally important neural fibers, the brainstem has been hard for brain imaging technologies to dissect. New software reliably and finely resolves eight distinct nerve bundles in live diffusion MRI scans, revealing signs of injury or disease.

The signals that drive many of the brain and body's most essential functions-consciousness, sleep, breathing, heart rate and motion-course through bundles of ""white matter"" fibers in the brainstem, but imaging systems so far have been unable to finely resolve these crucial neural cables. That has left researchers and doctors with little capability to assess how they are affected by trauma or neurodegeneration. In a new study, a team of MIT, Harvard, and Massachusetts General Hospital researchers unveil AI-powered software capable of automatically segmenting eight distinct bundles in any diffusion MRI sequence.

In the study in the Proceedings of the National Academy Sciences, the research team led by MIT graduate student Mark Olchanyi reports that their BrainStem Bundle Tool (BSBT), which they've made publicly available, revealed distinct patterns of structural changes in patients with Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and traumatic brain injury and shed light on Alzheimer's disease as well. Moreover, the study shows, BSBT retrospectively enabled tracking of bundle healing in a coma patient that reflected the patient's 7-month road to recovery.

The brainstem is a region of the brain that is essentially not explored because it is tough to image. People don't really understand its makeup from an imaging perspective. We need to understand what the organization of the white matter is in humans and how this organization breaks down in certain disorders.""

Mark Olchanyi, doctoral candidate in MIT's Medical Engineering and Medical Physics Program

Added Emery N. Brown, Olchanyi's thesis supervisor and co-senior author of the study: ""The brainstem is one of the body's most important control centers. Mark's algorithms are a significant contribution to imaging research and to our ability to understand the regulation of fundamental physiology. By enhancing our capacity to image the brainstem, he offers us new access to vital physiological functions such as control of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, temperature regulation, how we stay awake during the day and how we sleep at night.""

Brown is the Edward Hood Taplin Professor of Computational Neuroscience and Medical Engineering in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science and the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT. He is also an anesthesiologist at MGH and a professor at Harvard Medical School.

Diffusion MRI helps trace the long branches, or ""axons,"" that neurons extend to communicate with each other. Axons are typically clad in a sheath of fat called myelin and water diffuses along the axons within the myelin, which is also called the brain's ""white matter."" Diffusion MRI can highlight this very directed displacement of water. But segmenting the distinct bundles of axons in the brainstem has proved challenging because they are small and masked by flows of brain fluids and the motions produced by breathing and heart beats.

As part of his thesis work to better understand the neural mechanisms that underpin consciousness, Olchanyi wanted to develop an AI algorithm to overcome these obstacles. BSBT works by tracing fiber bundles that plunge into the brainstem from neighboring areas higher in the brain such as the thalamus and the cerebellum to produce a ""probabilistic fiber map."" An artificial intelligence module called a ""convolutional neural network"" then combines the map with several channels of imaging information from within the brainstem to distinguish eight individual bundles.

To train the neural network to segment the bundles, Olchanyi ""showed"" it 30 live diffusion MRI scans from volunteers in the Human Connectome Project (HCP). The scans were manually annotated to teach the neural network how to identify the bundles. Then he validated BSBT by testing its output against ""ground truth"" dissections of post-mortem human brains where the bundles were well delineated via microscopic inspection or very slow but ultra-high-resolution imaging. After training, BSBT became proficient in automatically identifying the eight distinct fiber bundles in new scans.

In an experiment to test its consistency and reliability, Olchanyi tasked BSBT with finding the bundles in 40 volunteers who underwent separate scans two months apart. In each case, the tool was able to find the same bundles in the same patients in each of their two scans. Olchanyi also tested BSBT with multiple data sets (not just the HCP) and even inspected how each component of the neural network contributed to BSBT's analysis by hobbling them one by one. 

""We put the neural network through the wringer,"" Olchanyi said. ""We wanted to make sure that it's actually doing these plausible segmentations and it is leveraging each of its individual components in a way that improves the accuracy.""

Once the algorithm was properly trained and validated, the research team moved on to testing whether the ability to segment distinct fiber bundles in diffusion MRI scans could enable tracking of how each bundle's volume and structure varied with disease or injury, creating a novel kind of biomarker. Though the brainstem has been difficult to examine in detail, many studies show that neurodegenerative diseases affect the brainstem, often early on in their progression.

Olchanyi, Brown and their co-authors applied BSBT to scores of datasets of diffusion MRI scans from patients with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, MS and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Patients were compared to controls and sometimes to themselves over time. In the scans, the tool measured bundle volume and ""fractional anisotropy"" (FA), which tracks how much water is flowing along the myelinated axons vs. how much is diffusing in other directions, a proxy for white matter structural integrity. 

In each condition, the tool found consistent patterns of changes in the bundles. While only one bundle showed significant decline in Alzheimer's, in Parkinson's the tool revealed a reduction in FA in three of the eight bundles. It also revealed volume loss in another bundle in patients between a baseline scan and a two-year follow-up. Patients with MS showed their greatest FA reductions in four bundles and volume loss in three. Meanwhile, TBI patients didn't show significant volume loss in any bundles, but FA reductions were apparent in the majority of bundles.

Testing in the study showed that BSBT proved more accurate than other classifier methods in discriminating between patients with health conditions vs. controls.

BSBT, therefore, can be ""a key adjunct that aids current diagnostic imaging methods by providing a fine-grained assessment of brainstem white matter structure and, in some cases, longitudinal information,"" the authors wrote.

Finally, in the case of a 29-year-old man who suffered a severe TBI, Olchanyi applied BSBT to scans taken during the man's 7-month coma. The tool showed that the man's brainstem bundles had been displaced but not cut and showed that over his 7-month coma, the lesions on the nerve bundles decreased by a factor of three in volume. As they healed, the bundles moved back into place as well.

The authors wrote that BSBT, ""has substantial prognostic potential by identifying preserved brainstem bundles that can facilitate coma recovery.""

Large-scale Swedish data reveal a female “catch-up” effect in autism diagnoses, reshaping how scientists understand sex differences in when, not whether, autism is identified.

Study: Time trends in the male to female ratio for autism incidence: population based, prospectively collected, birth cohort study. Image credit: Elenka Klimova/Shutterstock.com

A new study published in The BMJ points out that females are more likely to be diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder later in life than males.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by repetitive behaviors, verbal communication difficulties, socialization difficulties, and restrictive interests. The prevalence of this condition has increased significantly since the early 2000s. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data, the prevalence of ASD among 8-year-old children in the United States has increased from 0.7 % in 2002 to 3.3 % in 2022.

Over the past 30 years, the ratio of ASD diagnosis between males and females has mostly remained high, roughly at 4:1. Several theories have been put forward to explain this high male-to-female ratio for ASD diagnosis. Some theories indicate that females require a higher genetic burden than males for noticeable ASD-related behaviors, while others suggest that greater genetic variability in males may make them more likely to meet diagnostic thresholds for ASD.

The possibility of underdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis of ASD in females may be higher than in males, as girls and women typically have better social and communication skills that make symptom identification difficult. This may also contribute to the high male-to-female ratio for ASD diagnosis in childhood among females.

Despite several theories, direct population-level evidence explaining this imbalance has been largely absent. To fill this gap in the literature, researchers conducted a large-scale study in Sweden to examine temporal changes in ASD diagnosis rates among males and females over more than 35 years.

The research team used national registers to analyze ASD diagnosis rates among 2.76 million individuals born in Sweden between 1985 and 2020. Participants were followed up from birth to a maximum of 37 years, with follow-up extending to 2022.

The research team identified clinically diagnosed ASD in 2.8 % of participants over the 35-year follow-up period. The median age at diagnosis was 14.3 years.

Notably, the team found a shift in the diagnosis pattern with age. Specifically, the analysis revealed that the ASD diagnosis rate increased steadily with each five-year age interval throughout childhood. About a 10-fold increase in the ASD diagnosis rate was observed between 2000 and 2022, reflecting changes across calendar periods and birth cohorts, as well as evolving diagnostic practices over time.

Among males and females, the highest rates of diagnosis were observed in the 10–14- and 15–19-year age groups, respectively. The rates decreased afterwards for both males and females.

During the study follow-up period, the research team observed that males were more likely to be diagnosed with ASD in childhood, while females were more likely to be diagnosed during adolescence. This pattern resulted in a declining male-to-female ratio with increasing age, reaching approximately 1.2 by age 20 years in 2022, with statistical modelling projecting a cumulative male-to-female ratio of around 1.0 by around 2024.

The study provides valuable evidence that may refine the long-held belief that autism is more common among males than females. According to the findings, the well-known high male-to-female ratio for ASD diagnosis in childhood could be partly explained by the fact that females are more likely to be misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed with the disorder at younger ages. However, the ratio decreases substantially with increasing age, such that it may no longer be distinguishable by adulthood in Sweden.

The research team identifies a “catch-up” effect by the age of 20 years, when females are nearly as likely to have received an ASD diagnosis as males, based on cumulative incidence estimates and projections, suggesting a potentially similar lifetime rate of ASD diagnosis in both sexes within this population.

Several factors have been proposed in previous research to explain lower rates of ASD diagnosis in females during childhood. Females may exhibit greater biological, genetic, and developmental resilience that could make them less susceptible to earlier clinical identification of neurodevelopmental disorders like ASD.

Greater heritability has also been identified as a potential contributor to the higher prevalence of ASD in males. However, the study notes that higher heritability estimates in males may partly reflect non-genetic influences in females, including diagnostic ascertainment and differences in clinical presentation, rather than a strictly biological sex difference.

Another potential reason is that females are better than males at taking behavioral prompts from their peers, such as mimicking speech or expressions, leading to camouflaging of ASD-related traits and the resulting delay in detecting ASD-like behaviors.

The misattribution of symptoms to a previously identified psychiatric condition may also influence the age of ASD diagnosis and the variation in the male-to-female ratio by age at diagnosis. In this context, evidence indicates that almost 70 % of individuals with a diagnosis of ASD have at least one additional psychiatric condition and that women are more likely than men to have an earlier psychiatric diagnosis before an ASD diagnosis. These factors can potentially delay ASD diagnosis, especially in females.

Overall, the study findings highlight the need for investigating why females are diagnosed with ASD later in life than males. Future research in this field should consider the influence of other conditions linked to ASD, diagnostic practices, changes in diagnostic criteria over time, as well as shared genetic and environmental factors like parental mental health, for a more conclusive interpretation.

A landmark Lancet analysis of more than 150,000 trial participants challenges decades of statin side-effect warnings and calls for updated drug labels grounded in randomized evidence.

Study: Assessment of adverse effects attributed to statin therapy in product labels: a meta-analysis of double-blind randomised controlled trials. Image credit: roger ashford/Shutterstock.com

The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) Collaboration has recently conducted a meta-analysis of individual participant-level data from randomized clinical trials to evaluate the clinical reliability of potential treatment-related health adversities listed in statin product labels. The findings are published in The Lancet.

Statins are a class of medications that prevent heart attack and stroke by lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and reducing cholesterol buildup in blood vessels. Several large-scale randomized controlled clinical trials have highlighted the efficacy of statin therapy in reducing the risk of major cardiovascular events.

The main documented side-effect of statin therapy is myopathy, characterized by muscle injury and weakness, which occurs in approximately one case per 10,000 person-years. Rhabdomyolysis, a rare severe muscle injury caused by rapid skeletal muscle breakdown, has also been identified as a rare adverse effect of statin therapy, occurring in approximately 2–3 cases per 100,000 person-years. In individuals with glycaemic markers close to the diagnostic threshold, statin therapy has been found to increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

In contrast to randomized clinical trials, non-randomized observational studies have linked statin therapy with a range of health adversities, including hepatic dysfunction, depression, cognitive decline, sleep disturbance, acute kidney injury, and pancreatitis. However, these findings may be subject to bias, as the observational study design does not allow for assessing the causality of therapy-related associations.

Statin products mention details of treatment-related adverse effects on their labels, which are mainly based on findings from non-randomised or non-blinded sources of evidence. Such potentially unreliable information can influence both patients' and physicians' ability to make accurate decisions, which in turn may contribute to suboptimal treatment decisions.

In the current study, researchers meta-analyzed individual participant-level data from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) Collaboration to evaluate whether potential health adversities listed in statin product labels are causally associated with statin therapy.

The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) Collaboration conducts individual participant data meta-analyses of large-scale (1000 or more participants), long-term (two or more years), randomized controlled trials.

The research team meta-analyzed participant data from 19 randomized, double-blind trials with 123,940 participants and a median follow-up period of 4.5 years. A total of 66 adverse treatment outcomes listed in statin product labels were included in the reliability assessment.

Among 66 product-listed health adversities related to statin therapy, only four were reported by randomized, double-blinded trials, in addition to well-established muscle outcomes and type 2 diabetes. These adverse events included abnormal liver transaminases, other liver function test abnormalities, alterations in urinary composition, and edema.

The comparative analysis of different therapy intensities revealed that the risks of abnormal liver transaminases and other liver function test abnormalities are associated with high-intensity statin therapy, with the strongest signal observed for atorvastatin 80 mg. However, no such dose-dependent association was observed for alterations in urinary composition or edema.

This meta-analysis of participant data from randomized trials revealed that the majority of health adversities listed in product labels (cognitive impairment, depression, sleep disturbance, peripheral neuropathy, and many more) are not causally associated with statin therapy.

These findings indicate that most side-effect information listed in statin product labels is not supported by causal evidence from randomized trials, and that such labelling and other official sources of health information may require revision so that patients and their physicians can make appropriately informed decisions regarding statin therapy. Importantly, the absence of evidence for most outcomes does not prove that very rare adverse effects cannot occur, but indicates a lack of reliable causal support from blinded randomized data.

The study finds a dose-response effect for liver enzyme and liver function test abnormalities. However, no significant impact of high-intensity statin therapy on severe liver outcomes (cholestasis and jaundice, hepatic failure or damage, or hepatitis) has been observed.

Regarding urinary composition alteration and edema, the study identified small excess risks in statin-treated participants compared with placebo, reflecting laboratory changes in urine test measures, but could not detect a dose-response effect, suggesting uncertain clinical relevance of these treatment-related adverse events.

Although the meta-analysis included randomized data from more than 150,000 participants across 23 statin trials, the statistical power to detect very rare adverse events remains limited. Furthermore, the meta-analysis lacks some adverse event data from randomized trials due to privacy concerns among some companies providing the data. However, this missing data accounted for less than 1% of all participants and is unlikely to have any significant modulating effect on the findings.

Overall, the findings confirm that statin therapy increases hepatic transaminase levels and other liver function test abnormalities in a dose-dependent manner, although the absolute excess risks and clinical consequences appear low.

The findings reinforce previous conclusions that the cardiovascular benefits of statin therapy outweigh its known side effects. Regulatory authorities should consider revising and updating statin product labels and other official sources of health information to facilitate accurate risk–benefit analyses of statin therapy.

Pancreatic cancer has a lot of nerve. Notoriously tricky to detect, the disease also often resists traditional therapy. So, researchers are urgently looking for new ways to disrupt tumor formation. Though scientists know that the nervous system can help cancer spread, its role in the disease's earliest stages remains unclear. ""One phenomenon that is known is called perineural invasion,"" says Jeremy Nigri, a postdoc in Professor David Tuveson's lab at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL). ""This means cancer cells will migrate within the nerve and use the nerve as a way to metastasize.""

Now, Nigri and his colleagues at CSHL have discovered that the nervous system plays an active part in pancreatic cancer development, even before tumors form. Using 3D imaging, they found that tumor-promoting fibroblasts called myCAFs send out signals to attract nerve fibers. The myCAFs and nerve cells then work together within pancreatic lesions to create a favorable environment for cancer to grow. The findings are reported in Cancer Discovery, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research.

A technique called whole-mount immunofluorescence enabled Tuveson's team to take 3D photographs of the lesions and surrounding cells. Where standard 2D images show thin nerve fibers as scattered tiny dots, the 3D images reveal a dense network of nerves snaking through and around the myCAFs and lesions. ""When we first saw this picture, I was shocked,"" Nigri says. ""I couldn't even imagine the lesion like this. I'd only ever seen it in 2D.""

Nigri and his colleagues ran a series of experiments on mice and human cells that uncovered a vicious cycle between myCAFs and nerves. They found myCAFs give off signals that attract nerve fibers from the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for our fight-or-flight response. These nerve fibers release the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which binds to the fibroblasts and triggers a calcium spike that further activates myCAFs. This spike not only promotes pre-cancerous growth, but also pulls in even more nerve fibers, locking the system into a dangerous self-reinforcing loop.

In one experiment, we use a neurotoxin to disable the sympathetic nervous system. We show reduced fibroblast activation and a nearly 50% reduction in tumor growth.""

Jeremy Nigri, postdoc, CSHL

Because the myCAF-nerve loop happens so early, disrupting this cycle could lead to potential new therapies. The findings suggest that clinically available drugs, including doxazosin, may be effective when combined with standard treatments like chemotherapy or immunotherapy. ""The next step will be to study this more in detail and try to find a way to block the crosstalk between fibroblasts and nerves,"" Nigri says. ""With support from groups like the Lustgarten Foundation and Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, we hope to one day help improve patient outcomes.""

New evidence suggests AI-assisted auscultation may help clinicians detect hidden valvular heart disease earlier, potentially reshaping frontline cardiac screening while raising important questions about implementation and diagnostic balance.

In a recent prospective study published in the European Heart Journal Digital Health, researchers compared the diagnostic accuracy of primary care providers using standard stethoscopes with that of a relatively novel artificial intelligence (AI) enabled digital stethoscope. The study aimed to determine whether the latter could improve the accuracy of current diagnoses of valvular heart disease (VHD).

The study found that the AI system demonstrated a sensitivity of 92.3% for detecting audible VHD, compared with 46.2% for standard care (P = 0.01). Although the AI tool showed slightly lower specificity, it identified twice as many cases of previously undiagnosed moderate-to-severe disease, suggesting a role as a screening adjunct rather than a replacement for clinical assessment.

Valvular heart disease is a serious cardiac condition in which one or more heart valves, including the aortic, mitral, tricuspid, or pulmonary valves, fail to open or close properly, disrupting blood flow.

Common symptoms include shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, and palpitations. Disease prevalence increases with age and is estimated to affect more than half of adults over 65 to some degree, although moderate-to-severe disease is substantially less common.

Diagnosis remains challenging because more than half of patients with clinically significant disease are asymptomatic.

Traditionally, diagnosis relies on clinician-performed auscultation. However, prior research suggests that even experienced general practitioners achieve limited sensitivity when screening asymptomatic patients, contributing to delayed diagnosis and disease progression.

The study explored whether deep learning algorithms, combined with digital acoustic recordings, could help detect cardiac abnormalities that may be missed during routine examinations.

This was a prospective single-arm diagnostic accuracy study conducted across three primary care clinics between June 2021 and May 2023. The cohort included 357 patients aged 50 years and older who were at elevated cardiovascular risk but had no prior diagnosis of VHD or known cardiac murmur.

Risk factors included hypertension, body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, atrial fibrillation, prior myocardial infarction, stroke or transient ischemic attack, coronary revascularisation, or other established cardiovascular disease.

Participants underwent two independent screening protocols.

In standard-of-care (SOC) screening, primary care providers (PCP) performed four-point cardiac auscultation using conventional stethoscopes.

In AI-augmented screening, study coordinators recorded phonocardiogram (PCG) data using a digital stethoscope. Recordings were analysed by an AI algorithm cleared by the FDA to detect heart murmurs.

All participants underwent echocardiography to confirm structural heart disease. An independent expert panel reviewed the digital audio recordings to verify the presence of audible murmurs and was blinded to AI results.

Audible VHD was defined as moderate-to-severe disease confirmed on echocardiography, together with an expert-confirmed audible murmur, recognising that some structurally significant disease may not produce a clearly audible murmur.

The AI-augmented system substantially outperformed standard auscultation when detecting audible VHD. Sensitivity was 92.3% for AI compared with 46.2% for SOC screening (P = 0.01).

Among confirmed cases, standard examination missed seven of thirteen patients, whereas the AI system missed only one. For previously undiagnosed moderate-to-severe VHD, the AI identified 12 cases, compared with 6 detected by PCPs.

This increased sensitivity was accompanied by reduced specificity. The AI system demonstrated a specificity of 86.9 percent, compared with 95.6 percent for clinicians (P < 0.001), resulting in more false-positive findings.

Using echocardiography alone as the reference standard for moderate-to-severe disease, regardless of murmur audibility, the AI system still outperformed standard care, with a sensitivity of 39.7 percent versus 13.8 percent for clinicians (P = 0.01).

This study suggests that integrating AI-enabled digital stethoscopes into primary care may substantially improve the detection of VHD compared with traditional auscultation. These tools may function as a second layer of screening support, enabling earlier identification and referral.

Earlier detection does not automatically translate into improved clinical outcomes, as this study evaluated diagnostic accuracy rather than downstream management or prognosis.

Several authors reported affiliations with the device manufacturer, which should be considered when interpreting the findings despite disclosed conflicts of interest.

Lower specificity may increase echocardiography referrals and healthcare utilisation, underscoring the need for future cost-effectiveness analyses.

Limitations include a modest sample size, limited geographic scope, incomplete demographic detail, and lack of systematic symptom assessment. Despite these constraints, the findings indicate that AI augmentation may represent a meaningful advance in point-of-care cardiac screening.

Panic attacks are sudden bouts of intense fear without an obvious cause. An estimated 10% of people experience at least one panic attack in their lifetime. But between 2% and 3% of the population have such frequent and severe panic attacks that they meet the criteria for the debilitating condition 'panic disorder'.

The current standard of care for panic disorder is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), with or without antidepressants. A technique of CBT with proven efficacy is 'interoceptive exposure', where therapists trigger common symptoms of panic attacks like chest pain, sweating, rapid respiration, and a racing heart in a safe, controlled environment. Its aim is to raise tolerance to these symptoms by teaching patients that they aren't dangerous.

Typically, interoceptive exposure works through office-based exercises such as voluntary hyperventilation or spinning on a chair. But now, researchers have shown that a less artificial and more intense form of interoceptive exposure – brief intermittent intense exercise – is more effective. The results are published in Frontiers in Psychiatry.

Here we show that a 12-week program of brief intense intermittent exercise can be used as an interoceptive exposure strategy to treat panic disorder patients.""

Dr. Ricardo William Muotri, postdoctoral fellow at the Anxiety Disorders Program, University of São Paulo Medical School, Brazil

In this randomized controlled trial, Muotri and colleagues compared the effect of brief, intense intermittent exercise with a form of relaxation therapy commonly used in CBT, in 102 adult women and men diagnosed with panic disorder over a period of 12 weeks.

The participants were divided across two parallel arms and did three sessions every week of their allocated exercise. No drugs were administered to either group throughout the trial.

Patients in the experimental arm began each session with a bout of muscle-stretching, followed by 15 minutes of walking and one to six 30-seconds-long bouts of high-intensity running alternating with 4.5-minutes of active recovery, and ending with additional 15 minutes of walking. Patients in the control arm did segmental muscle contraction exercises in the brachial, scapular, cervical, facial, dorsal, abdominal, and lower limb regions, followed by localized muscle relaxation. All patients wore biometric monitoring devices during the exercises.

The primary endpoint was any change over a period of 24 weeks in a patient's score on the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (PAS), which rates the severity of panic symptoms from answers to 13 questions in a questionnaire. Secondary endpoints were analogous changes in scores on questionnaires for anxiety and depression, as well as the self-reported frequency and severity of panic attacks. A psychiatrist, blinded to treatment allocation, assessed outcomes on the endpoints.

The average PAS score, as well as the scores for anxiety and depression, decreased over time in both arms, but more steeply in the brief intense intermittent exercise arm. Similarly, the frequency and severity of panic attacks decreased more in the brief intense intermittent exercise arm.

The authors concluded that brief, intense intermittent exercise is a more effective method for interoceptive exposure than relaxation therapy for the treatment of panic disorder, with positive effects that last for at least 24 weeks. Because patients reported enjoying this method treatment more than relaxation therapy, engagement and compliance with the treatment are likely to be high.

""Healthcare professionals can adopt brief intermittent intense exercise as a natural and low-cost interoceptive exposure strategy. It doesn't need to take place in a clinical setting, so that exposure to the symptoms of a panic attack is brought closer to the patient's daily life. It could also be integrated into care models for anxiety and depression disorders,"" summarized Muotri.

Cellares, the first Integrated Development and Manufacturing Organization (IDMO), today announced a collaboration with the Stanford Center for Definitive and Curative Medicine (CDCM) and Stanford Innovative Medicines Accelerator (IMA) to automate manufacturing and release testing for gene-edited hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) therapies, expanding the application of Cellares' automation platforms beyond T cell therapies into a new cell modality.

Gene-edited HSCs are being developed as durable, potentially one-time treatments that rebuild the blood and immune system with corrected cells for patients with HIV and rare inherited diseases. Many of these conditions currently lack effective treatment options, highlighting the need for scalable, reliable manufacturing approaches that can support patient access as programs advance.

Under the collaboration, Cellares will establish a standardized platform manufacturing process on the Cell Shuttle™ and platform release assays on the Cell Q™, designed to apply across multiple indications. Automation efforts are already underway with the HARBOR KNOCK (safe harbor knock-in) gene-editing approach.

The effort is supported by the Stanford Innovative Medicines Accelerator (IMA) and Stanford Medicine Center for Definitive and Curative Medicine (CDCM). The collaboration aims to reduce hands-on variability and create a scalable foundation to help move academic innovation toward clinical development.

Matthew Porteus, MD, PhD, Director of the CDCM at Stanford University School of Medicine, and his lab, have developed an HSC gene-editing approach that can be applied across HIV and a wide range of monogenic diseases. One of their goals is to identify a manufacturing process that is consistent and scalable. Cellares' technology in automation could remove the barrier to making therapies more cost effective and accessible.

Gene-edited hematopoietic stem cells have the potential to address the root cause of disease for patients who today have limited or no treatment options, With Stanford Medicine, we're building a manufacturing and analytical foundation that can be applied across many rare disease programs to improve patient access.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","This Ballad hospital, flooded by Hurricane Helene, will be rebuilt for $44M in a flood plain","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260209/This-Ballad-hospital-flooded-by-Hurricane-Helene-will-be-rebuilt-for-2444M-in-a-flood-plain.aspx","Mon, 09 Feb 2026 10:50:00 GMT","

A small Tennessee hospital that was destroyed by a surging river during Hurricane Helene will soon be rebuilt on low-lying farmland that could face several feet of flooding in a much smaller storm, risking another disaster if the new facility is not built to withstand extreme weather, according to a KFF Health News analysis.

Ballad Health announced in January that it would spend about $44 million to rebuild the 10-bed Unicoi County Hospital in a field behind a Walmart in Unicoi, Tennessee, about 7 miles from the shuttered hospital that was the site of catastrophic flooding and a daring helicopter rescue on Sept. 27, 2024.

But the new location also faces significant flood risk, according to a KFF Health News review of information from Fathom and First Street, two climate data companies whose flood modeling is considered more sophisticated than outdated flood maps published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Both Fathom and First Street estimate that a 100-year flood — a weather event more common and less intense than Helene — could cover much of the hospital site with more than 2 feet of water.

""The proposed site is so obviously a flood plain geomorphologically,"" said Oliver Wing, chief scientific officer at Fathom. ""You don't need a model to see that.""

Wing said the new hospital site was actually more likely to flood than the old site and ""very risky"" for development due to a nearby creek and potential storm runoff from mountains to the west. But the flooding would be less powerful than at the old site, Wing said, and its impact could be lessened by elevating the hospital or building earthen embankments.

Ballad Health confirmed the new hospital location but did not respond to questions about flood risk or defenses planned for the site. In a brief written statement, spokesperson Molly Luton said Ballad was working with geotechnical professionals, Zurich Insurance Group, and a high-profile architecture firm in Nashville, Earl Swensson Associates, to ""plan and build a safe hospital for the Unicoi County community."" Luton said Ballad is also working with FEMA, which is providing about $7.4 million for the rebuild.

FEMA has served as the nation's de facto authority for estimating flood risk for half a century, and its flood maps generally determine which buildings must be designed to withstand a flood. But those maps are often incomplete and do not account for the impacts of climate change. FEMA's flood maps of Unicoi, last updated in 2008, do not identify the new hospital site as a flood hazard zone.

Nationwide, FEMA maps don't capture much of the flood risk identified by Fathom and First Street, which use sophisticated computer models and detailed terrain data to create flood simulations that are relied on by major developers, insurance companies, and government agencies. First Street publishes much of its modeling online, while Fathom shared data with KFF Health News through a data-use agreement.

Chad Berginnis, executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers, said that while the hilly terrain of northeastern Tennessee may limit Ballad's options to rebuild, it should not ignore the data from Fathom and First Street or rely purely on FEMA's maps, which suggest the hospital could be built with minimal flood protections.

If Ballad builds behind the Walmart, Berginnis said, it should follow the latest standards from the American Society of Civil Engineers, which recommend elevating hospitals enough to withstand a 1,000-year flood — like the one caused by Helene.

According to those standards and Google Earth elevation data, that could require earthwork to raise the ground of the Unicoi site by at least 8 feet and as much as 18 feet before construction.

""It's going to require some elevation, and there is going to be some cost,"" Berginnis said. ""But, my God, you just lost your dang hospital.""

The destruction of Unicoi County Hospital in 2024 prompted a KFF Health News investigation into hospital flood risk, which used Fathom data to identify more than 170 hospitals across the nation that face the greatest risk of significant or dangerous flooding. Of those hospitals, at least 39 faced circumstances similar to Unicoi's: Nearby rivers or creeks were predicted to swell beyond their banks and engulf the facility.

Ballad Health, which owns Unicoi and 19 other hospitals in Tennessee and Virginia, is the nation's largest state-sanctioned hospital monopoly and the only option for hospital care for most residents in a 29-county region of Appalachia.

In a news release announcing the Unicoi reconstruction, Ballad said it was finalizing a land purchase for the new hospital site and expected construction to begin in the spring and last two years. Ballad Health Chief Operating Officer Eric Deaton said the reconstruction announcement was ""a long-awaited step toward healing.""

""Rebuilding Unicoi County Hospital is about more than bricks and mortar,"" Deaton said in the release. ""It's about keeping care close to home for people who have been through so much.""

Tennessee state Rep. Renea Jones, a Republican whose district includes both the old and new Unicoi hospital sites, praised the reconstruction plan in Ballad's news release. The release did not mention that Ballad would buy about 15 acres of land for the new hospital from Jones' family, which was first reported by local television station WJHL and later confirmed by Tennessee public records.

Jones did not agree to be interviewed about the sale of the property or its flood risk.

The destroyed Unicoi County Hospital, which cost $30 million, was built along a bend of the Nolichucky River even though FEMA had labeled that area a flood zone for decades. Mountain States Health Alliance began construction in 2017, then later became Ballad Health, which opened the hospital in 2018.

Alan Levine, who was the CEO of Mountain States and now leads Ballad, told KFF Health News in a 2024 interview that Mountain States was aware of the flood risk when Unicoi was built but believed levees could protect the facility.

""I feel like everything we did when we built it was done the right way,"" Levine said.

Helene proved too much to handle. As the hurricane carved a deadly path across Southern states and into Appalachia, heavy rainfall caused the Nolichucky to overspill its banks and engulf the hospital in as much as 12 feet of water.

Floodwater pushed inside the hospital and cut the power, forcing patients and staff to evacuate to the roof in hopes of rescue. Ultimately, helicopters plucked 70 people from the roof and the rushing water, narrowly avoiding fatalities.

Angel Mitchell, a Unicoi survivor who was airlifted to safety with her ailing mother, said she was appalled that the hospital would be rebuilt in an area vulnerable to another flood.

But the worst part, Mitchell said, was that locals would have little choice but to tolerate the risk because of Ballad's monopoly.

""It's ridiculous,"" Mitchell said. ""We want to go somewhere to heal, not somewhere to worry.""

Rebekah Stewart, a nurse at the U.S. Public Health Service, got a call last April that brought her to tears. She had been selected for deployment to the Trump administration's new immigration detention operation at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.

This posting combined Donald Trump's longtime passion to use the offshore base to move ""some bad dudes"" out of the United States with a promise made shortly after his inauguration last year to hold thousands of noncitizens there. The naval base is known for the torture and inhumane treatment of men suspected of terrorism in the wake of 9/11.

""Deployments are typically not something you can say no to,"" Stewart said. She pleaded with the coordinating office, which found another nurse to go in her place.

Other public health officers who worked at Guantánamo in the past year described conditions there for the detainees, some of whom learned they were in Cuba from the nurses and doctors sent to care for them. They treated immigrants detained in a dark prison called Camp 6, where no sunlight filters in, said the officers, whom KFF Health News agreed not to name because they fear retaliation for speaking publicly. It previously held people with suspected ties to al-Qaida. The officers said they were not briefed ahead of time on the details of their potential duties at the base.

Although the Public Health Service is not a branch of the U.S. armed forces, its uniformed officers — roughly 5,000 doctors, nurses, and other health workers — act like stethoscope-wearing soldiers in emergencies. The government deploys them during hurricanes, wildfires, mass shootings, and measles outbreaks. In the interim, they fill gaps at an alphabet soup of government agencies.

The Trump administration's mass arrests to curb immigration have created a new type of health emergency as the number of people detained reaches record highs. About 71,000 immigrants are currently imprisoned, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement data, which shows that most have no criminal record.



Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has said: ""President Donald Trump has been very clear: Guantanamo Bay will hold the worst of the worst."" However, several news organizations have reported that many of the men shipped to the base had no criminal convictions. As many as 90% of them were described as ""low-risk"" in a May progress report from ICE.

In fits and starts, the Trump administration has sent about 780 noncitizens to Guantánamo Bay, according to The New York Times. Numbers fluctuate as new detainees arrive and others are returned to the U.S. or deported.

While some Public Health Service officers have provided medical care to detained immigrants in the past, this is the first time in American history that Guantánamo has been used to house immigrants who had been living in the U.S. Officers said ICE postings are getting more common. After dodging Guantánamo, Stewart was instructed to report to an ICE detention center in Texas.

""Public health officers are being asked to facilitate a man-made humanitarian crisis,"" she said.

Seeing no option to refuse deployments that she found objectionable, Stewart resigned after a decade of service. She would give up the prospect of a pension offered after 20 years.

""It was one of the hardest decisions I ever had to make,"" she said. ""It was my dream job.""

One of her PHS colleagues, nurse Dena Bushman, grappled with a similar moral dilemma when she got a notice to report to Guantánamo a few weeks after the shooting at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in August. Bushman, who was posted with the CDC, got a medical waiver delaying her deployment on account of stress and grief. She considered resigning, then did.

""This may sound extreme,"" Bushman said. ""But when I was making this decision, I couldn't help but think about how the people who fed those imprisoned in concentration camps were still part of the Nazi regime.""

Others have resigned, but many officers remain. While they are alarmed by Trump's tactics, detained people need care, multiple PHS officers told KFF Health News.

""We do the best we can to provide care to people in this shit show,"" said a PHS nurse who worked in detention facilities last year.

""I respect people and treat them like humans,"" she said. ""I try to be a light in the darkness, the one person that makes someone smile in this horrible mess.""

The PHS officers conceded that their power to protect people was limited in a detention system fraught with overcrowding, disorganization, and the psychological trauma of uncertainty, family separations, and sleep deprivation.

""Ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE,"" said Tricia McLaughlin, chief spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, in an emailed statement to KFF Health News.

Adm. Brian Christine, assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the Public Health Service, said in an email: ""Our duty is clear: say ""Yes Sir!"", salute smartly, and execute the mission: show up, provide humane care, and protect health."" Christine is a recent appointee who, until recently, was a urologist specializing in testosterone and male fertility issues.

""In pursuit of subjective morality or public displays of virtue,"" he added, ""we risk abandoning the very individuals we pledged to serve.""

In the months before Stewart resigned, she reflected on her previous deployments, during Trump's first term, to immigration processing centers run by Customs and Border Protection. Fifty women were held in a single concrete cell in Texas, she recalled.

""The most impactful thing I could do was to convince the guards to allow the women, who had been in there for a week, to shower,"" she said. ""I witnessed suffering without having much ability to address it.""

Stewart spoke with Bushman and other PHS officers who were embedded at the CDC last year. They assisted with the agency's response to ongoing measles outbreaks, with sexually transmitted infection research, and more. Their roles became crucial last year as the Trump administration laid off droves of CDC staffers.

Stewart, Bushman, and a few other PHS officers at the CDC said they met with middle managers to ask for details about the deployments: If they went to Guantánamo and ICE facilities, how much power would they have to provide what they considered medically necessary care? If they saw anything unethical, how could they report it? Would it be investigated? Would they be protected from reprisal?

Stewart and Bushman said they were given a PHS office phone number they could call if they had a complaint while on assignment. Otherwise, they said, their questions went unanswered. They resigned and so never went to Guantánamo.

PHS officers who were deployed to the base told KFF Health News they weren't given details about their potential duties — or the standard operating procedure for medical care — before they arrived.

Stephen Xenakis, a retired Army general and a psychiatrist who has advised on medical care at Guantánamo for two decades, said that was troubling. Before health workers deploy, he said, they should understand what they'll be expected to do.

The consequences of insufficient preparation can be severe. In 2014, the Navy threatened to court-martial one of its nurses at Guantánamo who refused to force-feed prisoners on hunger strike, who were protesting inhumane treatment and indefinite detention. The protocol was brutal: A person was shackled to a five-point restraint chair as nurses shoved a tube for liquid food into their stomach through their nostrils.

""He wasn't given clear guidance in advance on how these procedures would be conducted at Guantánamo,"" Xenakis said of the nurse. ""Until he saw it, he didn't understand how painful it was for detainees.""

The American Nurses Association and Physicians for Human Rights sided with the nurse, saying his objection was guided by professional ethics. After a year, the military dropped the charges.

A uniformed doctor or nurse's power tends to depend on their rank, their supervisor, and chains of command, Xenakis said. He helped put an end to some inhumane practices at Guantánamo more than a decade ago, when he and other retired generals and admirals publicly objected to certain interrogation techniques, such as one called ""walling,"" in which interrogators slammed the heads of detainees suspected of terrorism against a wall, causing slight concussions. Xenakis argued that science didn't support ""walling"" as an effective means of interrogation, and that it was unethical, amounting to torture.

Torture hasn't been reported from Guantánamo's immigration operation, but ICE shift reports obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by the government watchdog group American Oversight note concerns about detainees resorting to hunger strikes and self-harm.

""Welfare checks with potential hunger strike IA's,"" short for illegal aliens, says an April 30 note from a contractor working with ICE. ""In case of a hunger strike or other emergencies,"" the report adds, the PHS and ICE are ""coordinating policies and procedures.""

""De-escalation of potential pod wide hunger strike/potential riot,"" says an entry from July 8. ""Speak with alien on suicide watch regarding well being.""

Inmates and investigations have reported delayed medical care at immigration detention facilities and dangerous conditions, including overcrowding and a lack of sanitation. Thirty-two people died in ICE custody in 2025, making it the deadliest year in two decades.

""They are arresting and detaining more people than their facilities can support,"" one PHS officer told KFF Health News. The most prevalent problem the officer saw among imprisoned immigrants was psychological. They worried about never seeing their families again or being sent back to a country where they feared they'd be killed. ""People are scared out of their minds,"" the officer said.

The PHS officers who were at Guantánamo told KFF Health News that the men they saw were detained in either low-security barracks, with a handful of people per room, or in Camp 6, a dark, high-security facility without natural light. The ICE shift reports describe the two stations by their position on the island, Leeward for the barracks and Windward for Camp 6. About 50 Cuban men sent to Guantánamo in December and January have languished at Camp 6.

A Navy hospital on the base mainly serves the military and other residents who aren't locked up — and in any case, its capabilities are limited, the officers said. To reduce the chance of expensive medical evacuations back to the U.S. to see specialists quickly, they said, the immigrants were screened before being shipped to Guantánamo. People over age 60 or who needed daily drugs to manage diabetes and high blood pressure, for example, were generally excluded. Still, the officers said, some detainees have had to be evacuated back to Florida.

PHS nurses and doctors said they screened immigrants again when they arrived and provided ongoing care, fielding complaints including about gastrointestinal distress and depression. One ICE monthly progress report says, ""The USPHS psychologist started an exercise group"" for detainees.

Doctors' requests for lab work were often turned down because of logistical hurdles, partly due to the number of agencies working together on the base, the officers said. Even a routine test, a complete blood count, took weeks to process, versus hours in the U.S.

DHS and the Department of Defense, which have coordinated on the Guantánamo immigration operation, did not respond to requests for comment about their work there.

One PHS officer who helped medically screen new detainees said they were often surprised to learn they were at Guantánamo.

""I'd tell them, 'I'm sorry you are here,'"" the officer said. ""No one freaked out. It was like the ten-millionth time they had been transferred."" Some of the men had been detained in various facilities for five or six months and said they wanted to return to their home countries, according to the officer. Health workers had neither an answer nor a fix.

Unlike ICE detention facilities in the U.S., Guantánamo hasn't been overcrowded. ""I have never been so not busy at work,"" one officer said. A military base on a tropical island, Guantánamo offers activities such as snorkeling, paddleboard yoga, and kickboxing to those who aren't imprisoned. Even so, the officer said they would rather be home than on this assignment on the taxpayer's dime.

Transporting staff and supplies to the island and maintaining them on-base is enormously expensive. The government paid an estimated $16,500 per day, per detainee at Guantánamo, to hold those accused of terrorism, according to a 2025 Washington Post analysis of DOD data. (The average cost to detain immigrants in ICE facilities in the U.S. is $157 a day.)

Even so, the funding has skyrocketed: Congress granted ICE a record $78 billion for fiscal year 2026, a staggering increase from $9.9 billion in 2024 and $6.5 billion nearly a decade ago.

Last year, the Trump administration also diverted more than $2 billion from the national defense budget to immigration operations, according to a report from congressional Democrats. About $60 million of it went to Guantánamo.

""Detaining noncitizens at Guantanamo is far more costly and logistically burdensome than holding them in ICE detention facilities within the United States,"" wrote Deborah Fleischaker, a former assistant director at ICE, in a declaration submitted as part of a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union early last year. In December, a federal judge rejected the Trump administration's request to dismiss a separate ACLU case questioning the legality of detaining immigrants outside the U.S.

Anne Schuchat, who served with the PHS for 30 years before retiring in 2018, said PHS deployments to detention centers may cost the nation in terms of security, too. ""A key concern has always been to have enough of these officers available for public health emergencies,"" she said.

Andrew Nixon, an HHS spokesperson, said the immigration deployments don't affect the public health service's potential response to other emergencies.

In the past, PHS officers have stood up medical shelters during hurricanes in Louisiana and Texas, rolled out covid testing in the earliest months of the pandemic, and provided crisis support after the deadly shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School and the Boston Marathon bombing.

""It's important for the public to be aware of how many government resources are being used so that the current administration can carry out this one agenda,"" said Stewart, one of the nurses who resigned. ""This one thing that's probably turning us into the types of countries we have fought wars against.""

Expanded physician-led air ambulance services are improving access to advanced prehospital care across the UK, yet important regional and overnight gaps highlight ongoing challenges in delivering equitable lifesaving treatment.



Study: Access to physician-based Helicopter Emergency Medical Services in the UK: a service analysis in 2024. Image Credit: Jaromir Chalabala / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the Emergency Medicine Journal, researchers evaluated national access to physician-based Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS) in the United Kingdom and assessed how availability and advanced interventions vary across regions and time.

When a person suffers severe trauma or sudden critical illness, minutes can mean the difference between life and death. In the United Kingdom, advanced lifesaving interventions, such as prehospital emergency anesthesia, can be delivered only by physician-based prehospital teams; however, access to this level of care is often inconsistent across regions.

A national review in 2009 revealed that round-the-clock physician-led HEMS services were extremely rare. Since then, trauma networks, training pathways, and service delivery models have evolved substantially. This raises a critical question: has access to physician-based prehospital care improved for patients regardless of where or when emergencies occur? Evaluating whether progress has translated into equitable and reliable national coverage remains essential.

A national service analysis was conducted using an online survey distributed to all HEMS services operating across the United Kingdom. The survey was circulated between January and March 2024 to medical and operational leads within each service. One response per service was permitted, with follow-up clarification obtained where discrepancies arose. Participation was voluntary and uncompensated.

For classification purposes, a physician-based HEMS team was defined as one in which a physician was present on more than 95 percent of operational shifts. Teams that did not meet this threshold were included in overall service counts but excluded from analyses of advanced prehospital care capability. Data collected included funding structures, staffing models, dispatch operations, working hours, and the range of interventions provided.

To enable regional comparisons, respondents reported service availability at standardized weekday and weekend time points during both daytime and overnight hours. Population density data were used as a proxy for clinical demand, based on publicly available national statistics. Primary outcomes focused on the number and operational coverage of physician-based teams, while secondary outcomes examined intervention availability and the presence of additional prehospital critical care resources.

All 21 HEMS services operating in the United Kingdom responded to the survey, providing complete national coverage.

The analysis estimated an increase from 11 physician-based teams in 2009 to approximately 30 teams in 2024, representing a roughly 2.7-fold increase, including services in Scotland. This reflects a substantial expansion in potential access to advanced prehospital care.

Despite this progress, round-the-clock availability remained uneven. In 2024, approximately half of the services provided continuous 24-hour physician-based coverage. This marked an improvement from 2009, when only one service operated at this level, yet significant regional gaps persisted. The East of England demonstrated the highest overnight availability, while Northern Ireland, South West England, and parts of Northern England lacked consistent overnight physician coverage.

Some services ceased operations in the early evening, whereas others remained active into the early morning. Not all services routinely operated aircraft overnight; some relied instead on ground-based response vehicles.

Population-adjusted access also varied significantly. Nationally, the ratio was approximately 0.63 HEMS teams per million people, including all teams, not only physician-based units. Availability tended to be higher in less densely populated regions and lower in major urban centers such as London. These disparities highlight how geography, population distribution, service configuration, and dispatch practices shape real-world access.

All physician-based teams were capable of delivering advanced Level 3 prehospital interventions, including prehospital emergency anesthesia, surgical airways, thoracostomies, amputations, resuscitative thoracotomies, and resuscitative hysterotomies. However, the availability of other advanced procedures varied. Most teams carried blood products; many provided regional anesthesia and arterial line placement; fewer offered dried plasma; and only one service reported the capability to perform resuscitative balloon occlusion of the aorta.

Beyond HEMS, all regions reported access to additional prehospital critical care assets. These included paramedic-led teams capable of delivering intermediate-level interventions and volunteer physician responders affiliated with the British Association for Immediate Care. Funding models differed substantially, with most services relying partly or entirely on charitable funding, whereas only one service was fully supported by government funding. The study did not directly test causal links between funding structure and service availability.

Access to physician-based HEMS in the United Kingdom has improved markedly over the past decade, with more teams and greater overnight coverage than previously reported. Nevertheless, access to advanced prehospital care continues to depend strongly on geography and time of day.

Persistent variation in operating hours, intervention availability, and funding models raises concerns about equity of access. Given evidence suggesting potential survival benefits in some contexts, alongside acknowledged uncertainty, these findings highlight the need for coordinated national policy, sustainable funding mechanisms, and system-wide planning to ensure that advanced prehospital critical care is available to all patients who need it, regardless of location or timing. The authors note that this survey alone cannot fully characterize access to all prehospital critical care resources nationwide.

Announcing a new article publication for BIO Integration journal. Soft and sustainable wearable bioelectronics are emerging as key platforms for personal health monitoring and digital healthcare.

These systems can continuously acquire electrical, mechanical, and biochemical signals during daily life by integrating skin-like soft materials, hydrogel-based interfaces, and environmentally conscious device architectures with wireless communication and data analytics and in some cases, deliver closed-loop interventions.

Recent advances have enabled multimodal skin-interfaced patches for chronic disease management, soft cardiovascular and neural interfaces for long-term regulation, and intelligent hydrogel dressings for wound monitoring and therapy. At the same time, concepts of biodegradability, self-healing, and reduced electronic waste are being incorporated to align device lifetimes with therapeutic needs.

This article summarizes key material and system-level strategies, highlights representative applications in chronic diseases, cardiovascular and neural regulation, and wound care, and discusses the remaining challenges in long-term biocompatibility and stability, data governance and regulation, and the integration of artificial intelligence and miniaturized architectures for future soft bioelectronic systems.

Chronic alcohol consumption profoundly alters gene expression in key brain regions involved in reward, impulse control, and decision-making, according to a study led by researchers at the Institute for Neurosciences, a joint center of Miguel Hernández University of Elche (UMH) and the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC). Published in the journal Addiction, the work provides new insight into the biological basis of alcohol addiction and points toward potential therapeutic targets.

Alcohol use disorder is one of the leading causes of disease and death worldwide, yet despite its enormous social and health impact, available treatment options remain limited. Understanding what changes in the brain after decades of alcohol consumption is essential for developing more effective therapies.""

Jorge Manzanares, senior author of the study, UMH professor

To address this question, the researchers analyzed post-mortem brain tissue from individuals who had consumed alcohol chronically for an average of 35 years. The study focused on the endocannabinoid system, a key neurobiological network involved in reward, motivation, and addictive behaviors.

The endocannabinoid system regulates fundamental brain functions such as pleasure, mood, memory, and stress response. It consists of receptors-including CB1 and CB2-their endogenous ligands, and enzymes responsible for ligand degradation, such as FAAH and MGLL. ""This system acts as a fine-tuned modulator of brain activity and plays a central role in reward and motivation,"" Manzanares explains.

Previous studies had shown that alcohol interacts with the endocannabinoid system, but evidence from human brain tissue was scarce. This study provides a detailed picture of how chronic alcohol use alters the expression of key endocannabinoid genes in brain regions critical to addiction.

Researchers examined two core components of the mesocorticolimbic system: the prefrontal cortex, involved in judgment, planning, and decision-making, and the nucleus accumbens, a central hub for reward processing and habit formation.

Compared with control samples from individuals without addiction, brain tissue from people with alcohol use disorder showed marked gene expression imbalances. Expression of the CB1 receptor gene increased by 125% in the prefrontal cortex and by 78% in the nucleus accumbens. ""CB1 is closely linked to reinforcement of addictive behaviors and relapse risk,"" explains UMH professor María Salud García-Gutiérrez, first author of the study.

In contrast, expression of the CB2 receptor gene decreased by approximately 50% in both regions. ""Because CB2 has neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory functions, its reduction suggests a weakening of the brain's defenses against alcohol-induced damage,"" García-Gutiérrez notes.

The study also revealed striking alterations in GPR55, a receptor long considered 'orphan' due to uncertainty about its natural ligand. GPR55 expression increased by 19% in the prefrontal cortex but dropped by 51% in the nucleus accumbens. This is the first study to document changes in GPR55 gene expression in humans with alcohol use disorder.

In addition, the researchers detected region-specific changes in FAAH, the enzyme responsible for degrading anandamide, an endocannabinoid involved in anxiety and reward. FAAH gene expression was reduced in the prefrontal cortex but increased by 24% in the nucleus accumbens, potentially altering endocannabinoid availability and signaling.

A major strength of the study is the use of brain tissue samples from the New South Wales Tissue Resource Centre in Australia. All samples came from individuals with chronic alcohol use disorder who did not consume other illicit drugs, allowing the researchers to isolate the specific effects of alcohol on the human brain. ""This approach provides a much clearer picture of how alcohol alone reshapes gene expression in brain regions central to addiction,"" García-Gutiérrez explains.

According to the authors, these findings help explain why individuals with alcohol use disorder show increased relapse vulnerability and impaired executive control. Identifying which components of the endocannabinoid system are altered, and where in the brain these changes occur, opens the door to more targeted and personalized therapeutic strategies.

In addition to Jorge Manzanares and María Salud García-Gutiérrez, the study was authored by Abraham Bailén Torregrosa, Francisco Navarrete, and Auxiliadora Aracil, members of the Translational Neuropsychopharmacology of Neurological and Psychiatric Disorders group at the Institute for Neurosciences and affiliated with the Primary Care Addiction Research Network of the Carlos III Health Institute and the Alicante Institute for Health and Biomedical Research (ISABIAL). Gabriel Rubio, researcher at the Hospital 12 de Octubre Health Research Institute (i+12), also contributed to the study.

The research was funded by the Carlos III Health Institute, the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, and the Spanish Ministry of Health, through national research networks in addiction and health, with additional support from ISABIAL. The Institute for Neurosciences is accredited as a Severo Ochoa Centre of Excellence.

...

Something special is unfolding in France's top soccer division, and at the heart of it stands the Alabama-born godson of a famous college football coach.

Tanner Tessmann — on pace to make the U.S. World Cup squad this summer after captaining the 2024 U.S. Olympic team — was in the lineup again Saturday as Olympique Lyonnais won at Nantes 1-0 for its 12th consecutive victory across all competitions.

Lyon has won six straight in Ligue 1 to ascend to third place — the final UEFA Champions League berth — along with three in a row to reach the French Cup quarterfinals and three straight in the Europa League, the continent's second-most important club competition, to clinch first place in the 36-team opening stage.

Going unbeaten in a dozen matches is a feat, but to avoid not only defeats but draws is staggering. The streak seemed in peril this weekend when a red card left Lyon with 10 men for the last half-hour, but resolute defending and a Nantes shot off the post preserved the run, which began Dec. 11.

Lyon finished sixth each of the previous two Ligue 1 seasons and hasn't ended in the top three since 2019.

Tessmann missed the first two games of the streak with a thigh injury and came off the bench in the subsequent two. Since then, he has started six of eight and substituted into the other two. Overall, the FC Dallas homegrown has appeared in 19 of 21 Ligue 1 matches, tying him for third on the squad, and started 16.

The 24-year-old defensive midfielder is in his second season in France after three with Italian club Venezia. Tessmann's godfather is Clemson football coach Dabo Swinney, who has been best friends with Tessmann's father P.J. since high school. P.J. runs Swinney's charitable foundation.

To Tanner, Swinney is “Uncle Bo.”

A talented soccer player and football kicker, Tessmann planned to play both sports at Clemson. Before enrolling, however, he signed a homegrown contract with FC Dallas.

His soccer path has taken him to two of Europe's top five leagues — Italy's Serie A in 2021-22 before relegation and France's Ligue 1 the past two seasons — and up the U.S. ladder. Since playing every minute of four Olympic matches in France, he has integrated into Mauricio Pochettino's senior squad. Last fall, he started twice and came off the bench twice, scoring in the 5-1 rout of Uruguay in Tampa.

With World Cup veteran Tyler Adams recovering from a knee injury, Tessmann's role could grow this spring. Pochettino is expected to summon him for the friendlies in late March against Belgium and Portugal in Atlanta — just a two-hour drive from Uncle Bo.

Elsewhere in France, striker Folarin Balogun's scoreless streak reached seven during his 90-minute effort in Monaco's 0-0 draw at Nice.

Wing back Tim Weah (90 poor minutes) was part of fourth-place Olympique Marseille's 5-0 embarrassment against the new front-runner, Paris Saint-Germain. Center back Mark McKenzie entered in the 81st of Toulouse's 1-0 loss at Angers, ending his string of nine straight 90-minute stints.

With a 59th-minute header, midfielder Weston McKennie scored his fourth Serie A goal and seventh overall to spark Juventus' two-goal rally for a 2-2 home draw with Lazio.

Forward Christian Pulisic and second-place AC Milan were off this weekend and, with the Winter Olympics leaving their home stadium unavailable, they will play their third consecutive away match Friday at Pisa.

Midfielder Yunus Musah and Atalanta will host Cremonese on Monday.

In the second division, Jonathan Klinsmann earned his first clean sheet since Nov. 28, a span of 10 matches, as Cesena defeated Pescara 2-0.

In his first start since late November, winger Alex Zendejas scored a marvelous goal on his 28th birthday as Club América edged Monterrey 1-0. A leg injury had sidelined him for the first four Liga MX Clausura matches before entering as a sub in the CONCACAF Champions Cup on Wednesday.

Center back Chris Richards went the distance as Crystal Palace won at Brighton 1-0, ending a 12-game winless streak in all competitions since mid-December.

Left back Antonee Robinson didn't play in Fulham's 2-1 loss to Everton, the first match he has sat out since his long-awaited return from injury in mid-December. Presumably he will return for Wednesday's visit to second-place Manchester City.

Midfielder Brenden Aaronson logged 78 minutes as Leeds rebounded from a four-goal loss at front-running Arsenal with a 3-1 victory over Nottingham Forest, staying six points above the relegation zone.

Striker Haji Wright's scoreless streak hit three during a 90-minute effort in Coventry City's 0-0 home draw with Oxford. Atop the second-tier table much of the campaign, the wobbling club is in danger of yielding the top spot Monday, when Middlesbrough visits Sheffield United. Nevertheless, with two teams assured promotion, Coventry holds a five-point cushion over third-place Ipswich Town.

Midfielder Aidan Morris is expected to start for Middlesbrough, which will visit Coventry next Monday.

Forward Patrick Agyemang made his 21st consecutive start for Derby County in a 2-1 loss to Ipswich Town. The Rams slipped from seventh to ninth place, two points off the pace for a spot in the promotion playoffs.

Midfielder Malik Tillman played 90 in Bayer Leverkusen's 1-1 draw at Mönchengladbach, leaving the club sixth in the Bundesliga and three points from the last Champions League slot next season.

Mönchengladbach midfielder Gio Reyna missed his third consecutive match with a muscle injury, while right wing back Joe Scally was a 79th-minute substitute.

Midfielder James Sands made his 16th straight start as next-to-last St. Pauli surprised Stuttgart, 2-1. Defender Noahkai Banks played the first half of Augsburg's 2-0 loss at Mainz.

Forward Damion Downs' scoreless streak since joining Hamburg on loan from Southampton hit 271 minutes after playing the second half of a 2-0 victory at Heidenheim.

In the second division, left back John Tolkin logged 90 in Holstein Kiel's 3-1 loss at Hannover, its third straight setback to leave it two points safe of the relegation playoffs.

Right back Sergiño Dest played all of PSV Eindhoven's 2-1 comeback victory at Groningen, stretching the leaders' streak in the Eredivisie to 16-0-2 since Sept. 13 and 19-1-2 overall.

U.S. men's national team attacker Tim Weah says a middle-of-the-night FaceTime call from manager Roberto De Zerbi and a quick embrace have helped him feel at home with Marseille, following a testing time with Serie A giants Juventus. 

Weah, 25, recalled De Zerbi's pursuit of him in the summer, using a relatively untraditional method in the modern game, in order to land the American forward. 

“The coach really believed in me,” Weah told Téléfoot. “He called me at four in the morning in my pyjamas, on FaceTime. He was smoking, and he said, ‘Tim, you have to come here. You'll see, this is your home.' And at the airport, I was received as if I were at home.”

Since arriving in Marseille, Weah has become a key player in De Zerbi's side and been embraced by the fanbase, going on to add that he is starting to feel “a bit like a Marseillais,” after just six months with his new club. 

This season, he has been a versatile attacking force, racking up two goals and two assists across 17 games in Ligue 1 action, while adding a goal and an assist in the UEFA Champions League. All told, it's given him a sense of belonging, after admitting that he was a “broken player” by the time he stepped away from Juventus. 

“When I arrived here, they took on a player who was a bit broken, lacking in confidence,” he added. “Getting up in the morning was hard for me, going to training. Because things weren't going well for me. So they took a chance on me.”

Given his success this season with Marseille, Weah, the son of former Ballon d'Or winner and Liberian Prime Minister, George Weah, hopes to translate his success at the 2026 World Cup when he dons the Stars and Stripes. 

Before that, he will keep his focus on the Ligue 1 season as Marseille look to find their way back into the automatic top three spots for Champions League qualification, currently sitting fourth with 39 points, behind Lyon on 42 points through 21 games each following a 5–0 defeat to Paris Saint-Germain.

While the club didn't advance to the knockout phase of the Champions League, there is still hope in the French Cup, where they are among the eight quarterfinalists after a round of 16 win over Rennes. 

""I want to stay at Olympique Marseille for a long time,” Weah added. “I give my all for this club, I want to win something here, and I hope to start this year. It would be a dream to win a trophy in my first season.”

For two Americans Abroad, it had been way too long since the last time they started a soccer game.

Kevin Paredes and Daryl Dike both made their first starts of the season over the weekend. The pair has seen injuries in recent years derail promising careers in Europe and with the U.S. men's national team.

At 22 and 25, both players have time on their side. But they also are playing on expiring contracts and have plenty of work to do over the next few months to prove to their sides (or another team) that they are worth the investment.

The return of Paredes and Dike headlines this week's Five.

Kevin Paredes started for Wolfsburg on Saturday, Feb. 7 against Borussia Dortmund. It was a win before the match even began.

Paredes hadn't started for 10 months prior to the match against Dortmund, having dealt with a foot injury for the better part of the last two years.

The injury limited Paredes to just two appearances last season. After a setback in preseason, the 22-year-old underwent surgery on the same troublesome foot in August.

Paredes put in a strong 65-minute shift in a 2-1 defeat to Dortmund, showing some incisive passing and a strong work-rate.

The Virginia native came up through D.C. United's academy as a wingback/winger who flew up and down the flanks. How much will his persistent foot injury change his trajectory? That could be the key to whether Paredes reaches his lofty potential.

Much like Paredes, Daryl Dike made his first start of the season over the weekend after battling his own injury hell.

The West Brom striker went 62 minutes in a 0-0 draw with Stoke City, nearly doubling his total of league minutes for the season.

It wasn't an especially impactful display for Dike but after several muscle injuries and two torn Achilles over the past few years, making a league start was an accomplishment in and of itself.

“I was really happy to get the nod,"" the 25-year-old said after the game. ""My performance was all right. Naturally, as a striker, you always want to score and help the team win. We didn't do that today, but I think the point is a good building block for us as a team and today is a good building block for me personally.

“I felt great physically and I really surprised myself. I was running around and felt fine. When they subbed me off I was a little bit annoyed because I wanted to keep going. I showed myself that I can still do everything that I can do. I know I have a lot to improve on.""

The most in-form goalscorer among Americans Abroad is an unlikely candidate for the title.

Weston McKennie isn't known as a prolific scorer, but the Juventus midfielder is on an absolute tear. McKennie's latest goal helped Juve secure a comeback 2-2 draw against Lazio, giving him a career-high seven goals on the campaign.

McKennie has five goals in 2026, more than any other Juventus player. In a contract year, the 27-year-old is ensuring he'll be getting paid next season no matter where he ends up.

Inter Miami midfielder Benjamin Cremaschi made a loan move to Parma in September, hoping to prove himself in a top European league.

But as the clock starts to wind down on his loan, Cremaschi can only be given an incomplete grade.

The 20-year-old has hardly featured for Parma, making five late-game cameos in Serie A this season for a total of less than 30 minutes.

Embroiled in a relegation battle, Parma boss Carlos Cuesta has decided that the untested U.S. international can't be trusted with so much at stake.

Cremaschi is faced with an uncertain club future. Parma has a purchase option at the end of the season which feels increasingly unlikely to be activated. Inter Miami may have moved on as well, winning a MLS Cup without him last season and making several midfield signings since his departure.

Aside from Paredes making the start, there was another major development during the Dortmund-Wolfsburg match — and it involved a player who didn't even see the field.

Mathis Albert, 16, made the bench for Dortmund for the first time. The winger has been fast-tracked through Dortmund's youth system, having established himself as one of the best prospects in all of Germany.

Dortmund may be dealing with a few injuries, which has seen Albert as well as fellow top prospects Luca Reggiani and Samuele Inacio called up to the senior side faster than expected. But head coach Niko Kovač said all three may be staying with his team for a while.

""We will be doing this more and more in the coming weeks,"" Kovač said. ""There is a reason the three of them are playing for BVB. The boys are internationals at youth level, so they have quality.”","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

Independent. Since 2003

February 9, 2026 10.40 Europe/London By Julian Clover

DAZN's agreement to exclusively distribute GRUP MEDIAPRO's dedicated 2026 FIFA World Cup channel on pay-TV in Spain will not remove the tournament entirely from free-to-air television, with key matches still protected by national regulations.

While the deal gives DAZN access to all 104 matches of the expanded FIFA World Cup 2026 via a linear World Cup channel and on-demand coverage, Spanish legislation requires listed events to be broadcast free-to-air. This is expected to include Spain's matches, the final and selected later-stage games, most likely shown by RTVE on La 1 and RTVE Play.

The Spanish model mirrors arrangements in other major European markets, where pay-TV and streaming operators hold comprehensive rights but public broadcasters retain access to protected fixtures.

In the UK, the World Cup is listed under Ofcom's “Group A” events, meaning live coverage must be available free-to-air. Recent tournaments have been shared between BBC and ITV, even where pay-TV operators have held broader FIFA rights portfolios.

Germany follows a similar approach, with public broadcasters ARD and ZDF guaranteed access to matches involving the national team and the final, alongside wider commercial exploitation by pay-TV and digital platforms.

In France, World Cup matches involving Les Bleus and the final are protected for free-to-air broadcast, typically via TF1, despite increasing competition from subscription-based sports services for full tournament coverage.

DAZN's Spanish deal underlines a broader European trend as streamers and pay-TV platforms secure end-to-end tournament coverage and dedicated channels, while free-to-air broadcasters maintain a reduced but high-impact role focused on national interest matches and major finals.

Further details on sublicensing and match allocations in Spain are expected closer to the start of the tournament, which runs from 11 June to 19 July 2026 across the United States, Canada and Mexico.

Cristiano Ronaldo is yet to win a major trophy since arriving in Saudi Arabia, and Al-Nassr will be hoping the 41-year-old Portuguese star returns to action on Wednesday to help the Riyadh club move closer to silverware.

Al-Nassr takes on Arkadag of Turkmenistan with a place in the quarterfinals of the Asian Champions League Two on the line.

Ronaldo hasn't played any part in Al-Nassr's most recent two games in the Saudi Pro League amid reports he was unhappy with the way the club is being funded, particularly after watching rival Al-Hilal sign Karim Benzema in last month's transfer window.

Al-Nassr, Al-Hilal, Al-Ittihad and Al-Ahli are all majority owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.

In a statement, the SPL outlined that no player is bigger than the club or the league.

“The Saudi Pro League is structured around a simple principle: every club operates independently under the same rules,” the league said. “Cristiano has been fully engaged with Al-Nassr since his arrival and has played an important role in the club's growth and ambition. But no individual — however significant — determines decisions beyond their own club.”

Despite the absence of the five-time Ballon d'Or winner, Al-Nassr beat reigning champion Al-Ittihad 2-0 on Friday.

Ittihad is the only one of three Saudi teams in the top-tier AFC Champions League Elite not to have secured a place in the round of 16, with two group games remaining.

Despite losing star striker Karim Benzema last week to Al-Hilal, which has a history of making high-profile signings, including Neymar from Paris Saint-Germain in 2023, Ittihad will advance to the next round if it defeats Al-Gharafa of Qatar on Tuesday.

The top eight in each of the tournament's two 12-team groups — divided geographically into East and West Asia — qualify for the second round.

Al-Hilal leads the western zone and is the only team with a perfect record of six wins from six, meaning coach Simone Inzaghi can choose to rest players. Al-Ahli, which won its first Champions League title in May, is also guaranteed a spot in the knockout stage.

In the eastern zone, only Vissel Kobe has clinched qualification, but Japan will have three teams in the round of 16 if both Sanfrecce Hiroshima and Machida Zelvia win this week.

The pressure is on China's three representatives, which occupy the bottom three positions.

Chinese champion Shanghai Port is in last place and on the verge of being ousted from the tournament. Wins for Chengdu Rongcheng and Shanghai Shenhua would keep both teams in contention.

Pundits have lambasted plans to hold three-minute hydration breaks in each half of the 104 games to be played at the 2026 FIFA Men's World Cup.

FIFA say the process for the drinks breaks will be a “streamlined and simplified” version of those used at previous tournaments, including the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup.

“The referee will stop the game 22 minutes into each half to allow players to rehydrate,” FIFA said.

“There will be no weather or temperature condition in place, with the breaks being called by the referee in all games, to ensure equal conditions for all teams, in all matches.”

Main photo: The All Whites and other participating teams will get two mandatory hydration breaks during their games.

Total A-Leagues show panellists Daniel McBreen and Tommy Oar have criticised the move, saying it will halt the flow of games.

“I think it's a disgrace,” McBreen said.

“Let's not beat around the bush. It's not about a drink break. It's about commercial income.”

The three-minute drink breaks will provide international broadcasters with the opportunity to insert commercials midway through each half of football.

“A lot of the American sports are very stop-start sports,” McBreen said.

Time-outs and team changes interrupt the flow of games.

“Momentum isn't a key feature [in those sports] as much as in football. It is completely different in football.

“This is just all about finances; it's got nothing to do with drinks breaks.”

Oar asked: “Where do you draw the line with this?

“I think it's an absolute disgrace, and people who have no feeling or understanding for the game are the ones who make these decisions, unfortunately.

“At the moment, it's just a little drinks break, and then next year it might be an extra minute, and all of a sudden the game's not two halves, it's four quarters.”

The 48-nation FIFA Men's World Cup will be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada.

Manolo Zubiria, chief tournament officer, United States, for the FIFA World Cup, said: “For every game, no matter where the games are played, no matter if there's a roof, (or) temperature-wise, there will be a three-minute hydration break. It will be three minutes from whistle to whistle in both halves,” he said.

“Obviously, if there's an injury (stoppage) at the moment of the 20th or 21st minute and it's ongoing, this will be addressed on the spot with the referee.”

FIFA say the use of hydration breaks is part of a focused effort to ensure the best possible conditions for players, drawing on the experiences of previous tournaments.

February 9 – Streaming giant DAZN's increasing influence within the sports broadcasting industry has another mainstream step with the announcement that it will become Spain's pay-television home of the World Cup in 2026.

Ever since partnering with FIFA on the Club World Cup, DAZN's relationship with the governing body has grown significantly and will include the relaunch of FIFA's own broadcast channel FIFA+ on the DAZN platform later this year.

Spanish public broadcaster RTVE will retain a free-to-air presence with one match per day, while DAZN will exclusively distribute the Grup Mediapro World Cup channel, carrying every game live and on demand.

According to Superdeporte, all 104 matches will be on the platform, and live behind a DAZN login. For the Club World Cup in the US last summer matches in Spain were free to watch but required a log-in. No detail of commercialisation of the World Cup broadcast has been announced, or the rights fee DAZN is paying.

RTVE's role remains significant in the big picture of free-to-air, but will now be selective. Spain's matches will be prioritised, alongside the opening game on June 11 at the Estadio Azteca, key knockout fixtures, both semi-finals, the third-place play-off, and of course, the final on July 11 at MetLife Stadium in New York.

Spanish broadcast regulation mandates that all Spanish matches plus the World Cup final have to be aired on free-to-air television.

For DAZN the objective is to gain subscribers beyond the traditional base, and with the expanded World Cup, match inventory is at an all-time high. The platform plans to give subscribers wall-to-wall coverage, analysis, storytelling, and the promise that fans won't miss a moment.

DAZN has a similar World Cup 2026 streaming deal in Brazil.

Óscar Vilda, DAZN's CEO for Spain and Portugal, said the partnership is about “democratising the spectacle” – accessibility through flexibility, innovation through streaming.

Emergency Information for American Citizens

As many as 10 million visitors will head to 11 U.S. cities this summer, helping to turn the FIFA World Cup 2026™ into the largest sporting event in history. While U.S. host cities like Los Angeles, Miami, New York and San Francisco are world-famous, lesser-known U.S. cities are primed to host soccer fans. In Kansas City, Missouri, for instance, Café Corazón owner Dulcinea Herrera says that people underestimate the Midwestern city of 500,000 (in a larger metro area of 2 million). Herrera and other local business owners are preparing for 650,000 visitors for FIFA World Cup 2026™. In addition to coffee, an American staple, Café Corazón serves yerba mate, a tea popular with South American soccer stars, including Lionel Messi, who will lead Argentina in an early round match scheduled for Kansas City. One of Herrera's three locations is in the downtown area where officials plan a massive viewing party near the stadium. White House World Cup Task Force Executive Director Andrew Giuliani calls it “a tremendous privilege” to host the FIFA World Cup 2026™ during the year the United States celebrates its 250th anniversary, and says the federal government is working with host cities to ensure a safe and welcoming tournament. “Hosting the world during this historic year … gives us a chance to show the very best of America — our hospitality and our innovation — while also showcasing the America spirit of which we're so proud of,” Giuliani said. Here is an introduction to the 11 U.S. cities that will host international soccer fans: Atlanta Famous for peaches, pecans and Southern hospitality, the Georgia state capital is a cultural and economic hub of the South. It boasts the country's busiest airport and was home to famed Civil Rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. Atlanta is home to numerous industries, including aerospace and financial technologies, as well as soft drink giant Coca-Cola. The city has several professional sports teams and has hosted three Super Bowls, as well as the 1996 summer Olympics.

International visitors who are in the city during the July 4th Independence Day celebrations can experience the Boston Pops , a fireworks show over the Charles River set to live music from the Boston Symphony Orchestra. FIFA and the U.S. Soccer Foundation are building soccer fields around Boston to turn the excitement of the city's seven matches into lasting participation in the sport.

As many as 10 million visitors will head to 11 U.S. cities this summer, helping to turn the FIFA World Cup 2026™ into the largest sporting event in history.

While U.S. host cities like Los Angeles, Miami, New York and San Francisco are world-famous, lesser-known U.S. cities are primed to host soccer fans. In Kansas City, Missouri, for instance, Café Corazón owner Dulcinea Herrera says that people underestimate the Midwestern city of 500,000 (in a larger metro area of 2 million). Herrera and other local business owners are preparing for 650,000 visitors for FIFA World Cup 2026™.

In addition to coffee, an American staple, Café Corazón serves yerba mate, a tea popular with South American soccer stars, including Lionel Messi, who will lead Argentina in an early round match scheduled for Kansas City. One of Herrera's three locations is in the downtown area where officials plan a massive viewing party near the stadium.

White House World Cup Task Force Executive Director Andrew Giuliani calls it “a tremendous privilege” to host the FIFA World Cup 2026™ during the year the United States celebrates its 250th anniversary, and says the federal government is working with host cities to ensure a safe and welcoming tournament.

“Hosting the world during this historic year … gives us a chance to show the very best of America — our hospitality and our innovation — while also showcasing the America spirit of which we're so proud of,” Giuliani said.

Here is an introduction to the 11 U.S. cities that will host international soccer fans:

Famous for peaches, pecans and Southern hospitality, the Georgia state capital is a cultural and economic hub of the South. It boasts the country's busiest airport and was home to famed Civil Rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.

Atlanta is home to numerous industries, including aerospace and financial technologies, as well as soft drink giant Coca-Cola. The city has several professional sports teams and has hosted three Super Bowls, as well as the 1996 summer Olympics.

The birthplace of the American Revolution, the city of Boston will be fully in celebration mode for the 250th anniversary when the fans arrive. International visitors who are in the city during the July 4th Independence Day celebrations can experience the Boston Pops , a fireworks show over the Charles River set to live music from the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

FIFA and the U.S. Soccer Foundation are building soccer fields around Boston to turn the excitement of the city's seven matches into lasting participation in the sport. Boston previously hosted three FIFA championships: the 1994 FIFA World Cup USA™, and the FIFA Women's World Cup™ in 1999 and 2003.

With its frequent rodeos, Dallas offers an up-close look at America's cowboy culture. Pioneer Plaza in downtown honors this Western tradition. Even the name of the city's pro football team, the Dallas Cowboys, references this distinct Western culture.

Airbnb is projecting that around 17,000 visitors will book its rentals during the FIFA World Cup 2026, creating what it estimates to be $167 million in regional economic impact, write Alex Barreira and Emma Dooling for the Philadelphia Business Journal.

These visits are expected to generate 126,000 room nights throughout Greater Philadelphia during the six World Cup matches planned for Lincoln Financial Field. According to the report, direct guest spending should reach about $52 million, while additional indirect and induced spending will likely push the total impact to roughly $167 million.

The 17,000 projected visitors make up only a fraction of the 149,000 tourists the report anticipates will travel to Philadelphia and require lodging during the World Cup. 

Airbnb guests are expected to spend around $109 per night on their stays and put about $411 toward transport. Local Airbnb hosts are projected to earn close to $1,900 per visit, which will average about $160 per night.

Additionally, the World Cup will have a long-term impact on local tourism, as, according to FIFA, 65 percent of World Cup visitors will often make a return visit to see the host cities after the competition has concluded.

Next summer, the FIFA World Cup is going to be held in over a dozen other cities across the United States, Canada and Mexico, including a semi-final in Mercedes-Benz Stadium. However, actions from the federal government and FIFA have caused anxieties about the event being held in the U.S.

The U.S. has hosted the World Cup once before, in 1994, and it caused an explosion in the popularity of soccer in the U.S. It paved the way for the formation of the MLS and the modern status of soccer as America's fifth major sport. The impending 2026 World Cup was hoped to be the same, injecting a fresh wave of enthusiasm and cash into the United State's continually growing soccer culture and economy Unfortunately, the Trump administration's policies have been affecting the World Cup both indirectly and directly. 

During the Club World Cup in July, FIFA President Gianni Infantino and President Trump colluded to hold the group draw for next year's World Cup in Washington D.C, where Trump would have easy access to the massive event to bring public attention to himself. FIFA itself is no stranger to corruption. In 2015, seven FIFA higher ups were arrested in Switzerland on corruption charges, which kicked off a year long saga where five more FIFA officials were arrested and the then President of FIFA, Sepp Blatter, resigned. 

Infantino has described Trump as his “great friend”, as well as gifting Trump a gold replica of the World Cup trophy, claiming it was “for winners only”. Infantino also tested the waters of Trump doing the group stage draw himself, calling it the “MAGA-FIFA World Cup Draw”. This would prove to be true, as during the draw on Dec. 5, Trump was awarded the brand-new “FIFA Peace Prize”. Trump was gifted a medal and gold trophy for the honor, claiming he had stopped 8 wars in 10 months. 

Infantino has visited Trump publicly more than he has visited any other national leader or soccer official. In contrast, he only visited Trump's successor/predescessor Joe Biden twice, and he has not yet visited Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, and met with Mexican President Claudia Finebaum for the first time in August. FIFA has even set up a headquarters in Trump Tower in New York City. Infantino claimed that Trump will present the World Cup trophy to the victor, further appealing to the current president.

Trump's political actions have caused an indirect impact on the world cup. African media and fans have expressed nervousness about attending the World Cup in America due to the recent immigration raids by ICE also causing problems for tourists. Trump has indefinitely frozen visas from 14 qualifying nations, including Brazil, the most successful team in World Cup history, and 2022 semi-finalist Morocco. While Trump has promised that teams and media will get exemptions from these restrictions, no indication has been given about whether spectators will be afforded the same luxury. Additionally, Trump's belligerent foreign policy has turned nations away, with Germany saying that if the U.S. invades Greenland the 4-time world champions will pull out of the tournament.

Infantino's close relationship with Trump can easily be a cause for concern as an additional issue looming over the head of the World Cup is Trump's crackdown on crime across numerous major cities in America. The federal government has deployed national guard troops to several cities across the nation, including World Cup host city Los Angeles. Trump has claimed that he can move the games of the World Cup away from cities he has deemed dangerous, such as Seattle, Boston and Los Angeles. While FIFA Vice President Victor Montagliani initially pushed back against these claims, FIFA later stated that they would leave matters of safety and security wholly to the governments of the three host nations. Moving games on such a short notice would be extremely detrimental to any travelling fans, as well as teams and officials who make the journey across the world to compete in the World Cup.

The World Cup both was and will be one of the most important sporting events to occur in the United States, promising to bring in over $47 billion dollars to The American, Canadian and Mexican economies. The federal government, on the other hand, is overstepping its hand and trying to control elements of the tournament that are traditionally run by FIFA, and it is likely that FIFA will let them.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Michael Carrick told which two big-name managers would stop him getting Man Utd job permanently as former Red Devils star urges club to 'ride the wave' with interim boss","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/michael-carrick-told-which-two-big-name-managers-would-stop-him-getting-man-utd-job-permanently-as-former-red-devils-star-urges-club-to-ride-the-wave-with-interim-boss/blt09d98f13f260c27e","Mon, 09 Feb 2026 13:55:12 GMT","

A former Manchester United midfielder believes the club would be mad to not make Michael Carrick manager on a permanent basis following his incredible start to the job since succeeding Ruben Amorim - unless they can lure one of two Champions League-winning coaches to Old Trafford. Carrick has won all four of his matches since being named United boss for the remainder of the season in January.

United have already begun the process of hiring a permanent boss, according to Gary Neville, and they will wait until near the end of the season before coming to a decision. Oliver Glasner and Andoni Iraola are set to be free agents, while England boss Thomas Tuchel could be free after the World Cup. But with each United victory, the case to make Carrick the permanent boss becomes ever more convincing.

Carrick has made the best start of any United manager since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who was also initially appointed on an interim basis until the end of the 2018-19 season, only to be given a longer contract following a run of 14 wins in his first 19 matches after succeeding Jose Mourinho. Carrick has said the club will not make a ""knee-jerk"" decision like they did back then.

Former United midfielder Owen Hargreaves believes his old team-mate Carrick should be the frontrunner, unless the club can convince either Tuchel or Paris Saint-Germain boss Luis Enrique to take the job.

Hargreaves, a commentator and pundit for TNT Sports, told GOAL: ""I don't see how you couldn't give it to him. I know they had the experience with Ole but he finished second and did great right up to a point. In the end in football you get the highs and lows. When it's good, you've got to enjoy it. Right now, Man United have it good. So if he [Carrick] finishes third or fourth, from where they were and all the noise, how could you not?

""The only thing you could throw at it was experience, and if you could get a Luis Enrique or Tuchel, maybe. But right now, the most important thing is not the manager or the players, it's a football club winning, and the football club is winning, and Carras is the architect of that. So why would you change that?""

Hargreaves, who formed a productive midfield partnership with Carrick as United won the Premier League title and the Champions League in the 2007-08 season, warned that big-name managers do not always succeed at Old Trafford, pointing to Louis van Gaal and Mourinho's ultimately disappointing tenures. He believes United's best bet is to build long-term under Carrick, who has formed a strong bond with the players in less than a month in charge.

Hargreaves explained: ""They already had two of the greatest managers in the last decade, you know, outside of Carlo Ancelotti and Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola, in Van Gaal and Mourinho. Names don't guarantee you success. If anything, names bring more expectation, and they'll say, 'I want this' and 'I want that'. So they can really build with somebody like Carras. And obviously, stop making it so short-term. Ride the wave while it's good, the football's good. Fans are happy, all the players are happy.""

Hargreaves first met Carrick when playing for the England Under-21 side in 2001. ""I would say he's always been the same,"" he added. ""I just think there's such a compliment to him, because he never gets too up or too down. He's just himself. It's so hard to just be yourself in this space where everybody's trying to make you into somebody. He's so comfortable in his own skin. 

""He carries himself with class. He treats everybody with respect. And he's a smart guy. He doesn't have to shout or yell. He's always watching. People think, 'Oh, I've got to shout as a coach' but you're there to help people get better. One of the things people forget is it's about people. It's not about you. You know, a lot of these guys are trying to make it about them. 

""Yeah, you've got to be in charge, you've got to make decisions in big moments. But ultimately you've got people trying to follow you, and you've got to inspire them to help you, help the team do well. And I think the more people you can reach and connect to, the better they're going to play for you. He's got to feel what United need and he's finding solutions, and everybody's playing well.""

Carrick has already overseen a longer winning streak in less than a month in the United job than Amorim did in 14 months in charge and the coach can match the club's longest run of victories in two years when his side visit his former club West Ham on Tuesday, which is live on TNT Sports.

TNT Sports is showing all 10 Premier League games this week. As well as United's trip to the London Stadium, fans can catch Chelsea vs Leeds, Tottenham vs Newcastle and Everton versus Bournemouth on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, Manchester City host Fulham looking to capitalise on their incredible comeback win over Liverpool, who will be hoping to pick up the pieces from their late collapse when they visit Sunderland. Also on Wednesday, Crystal Palace host Burnley, Aston Villa play at home to Brighton and Hove Albion while Nottingham Forest host Wolves.

Then, on Thursday, Premier League leaders Arsenal visit Brentford.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Pep Guardiola urges his Man City players to 'have a coffee' as he points out key area of improvement in dramatic comeback victory at Liverpool","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/pep-guardiola-man-city-players-have-a-coffee-points-out-key-area-improvement-dramatic-comeback-victory-liverpool/blt1616157a6279db87","Mon, 09 Feb 2026 09:23:01 GMT","

Pep Guardiola called on his Manchester City stars to ""have a coffee"" to find more composure in front of goal after a breathless 2-1 comeback win at Anfield. Despite securing a vital victory that cuts Arsenal's lead at the summit to six points, the City boss was critical of his side's frantic nature in both boxes. Erling Haaland's late penalty eventually sealed a dramatic turnaround against the reigning champions.

City's victory on Sunday was a significant one for Guardiola, as it was his first win at Anfield in front of a capacity crowd since joining the club in 2016. While City famously won 4-1 on Merseyside in 2021, that fixture was played behind closed doors due to the pandemic, leading Guardiola to joke that it ""doesn't count"" compared to the intensity of a full stadium. The result serves as a massive boost to City's title aspirations, moving them to within six points of league leaders Arsenal while inflicting a major blow on Liverpool's hopes for Champions League qualification.

The match itself was a tale of two halves. City dominated the opening 45 minutes with 10 shots to Liverpool's three but failed to capitalise on their chances, eventually falling behind to a spectacular 30-yard free-kick from Dominik Szoboszlai in the second period. Facing a daunting atmosphere and a one-goal deficit, City showed remarkable resilience. A late equaliser from Bernardo Silva set the stage for the 93rd-minute winner, as Erling Haaland converted from the penalty spot after Matheus Nunes was fouled by Alisson Becker.

Despite the elation of the late turnaround, Guardiola was characteristically focused on the areas where his side fell short. He expressed frustration at a lack of composure when his players reached the opponent's area, suggesting they were too rushed in their decision-making. The manager noted that his side's ""exceptional"" first-half display was undermined by a failure to remain calm in the final third, which allowed Liverpool to stay in the game and eventually take the lead.""

""The first half was exceptional but many times we are not composed enough in the final third, a little bit more calm to take the right decisions,"" Guardiola said. ""In the boxes you have to take a coffee, as a defender and as a striker, and we are so all the actions, always arrive one metre before or one metre later, never in the spot.

""But we are so young in many, many things and second half, we knew that they would push a little bit more, in the first half we played some long balls and we fought and Omar (Marmoush) and Erling they were there because I know it's an incredibly difficult task [dealing with Ibrahima] Konate and [Virgil] van Dijk, to win those balls, but the second half not even try.""

The catalyst for City's survival in a hostile environment was captain Bernardo Silva, whom Guardiola hailed as ""one of the best players I ever trained"". While other stars struggled with the aforementioned lack of composure, Silva remained the team's guiding light, following up his equaliser by providing the crucial pass that led to the match-winning penalty. Guardiola emphasised that the entire squad, including himself, follows the example set by the Portuguese midfielder's work rate and intelligence.

Guardiola highlighted how Silva's leadership helped the team navigate the moments after Szoboszlai's goal, which had threatened to derail City's afternoon. ""Being guided by our incredible player, our captain Bernardo, we follow him, I follow him too,"" the manager added. ""Because when a player always puts the team in front of him and does things through his own example, everybody follows him. Me the first, and he scored the first one and made the assist for the penalty to Matheus (Nunes), and yeah we won finally I would say at Anfield, always it's so difficult and I'm happy for the result for the guys, because we were there.""

The match concluded in extraordinary fashion as Liverpool's Szoboszlai was sent off in the 100th minute following a controversial VAR review. The incident occurred as Rayan Cherki rolled the ball into an empty net for City on the break; however, the goal was disallowed after officials ruled that Szoboszlai and Haaland had fouled each other in the build-up. The Hungarian midfielder was dismissed for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity, leaving Liverpool to finish the game with 10 men and a mounting injury crisis.

For City, the three points are transformative. With 13 games remaining, the six-point gap to Arsenal feels bridgeable, particularly with a Carabao Cup final and Champions League fixtures on the horizon. Guardiola acknowledged the difficulty of the task ahead, stating: ""It is still a lot considering how strong Arsenal are in all departments. It is better to have. I said the same, 13 games is a lot in the Premier League.

""The final of the Carabao Cup is coming, the Champions League is here... so many games,"" Guardiola added. ""Injuries and many things and every team play for something - Champions League qualification, Europa League, Conference League or not being relegated.

""Every game, the last 10 games from my experience, not drama but it is so difficult. The important thing is to try to be there, improve because the second half was not good enough again, and the game we did against Spurs was not good enough to win three points.

""Today it could happen the same. But it is a young team and maybe in the recent future we can improve on that.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Kylian Mbappe is “on track” to emulate Cristiano Ronaldo at Real Madrid, claims Los Blancos boss Alvaro Arbeloa, with the French superstar being backed to chase down a record-breaking tally of goals at the Bernabeu. Mbappe was on target in his latest appearance - a 2-0 victory over Valencia - and has reached 82 efforts in total for the Spanish heavyweights.

That tally, while being impressive, leaves the 27-year-old forward some way short of Ronaldo's stunning haul. The Portuguese GOAT, across nine memorable years in the Spanish capital, found the target on 450 occasions through 438 appearances.

CR7 passed the 40-goal mark in all but one of his memorable campaigns in Madrid, topping 50 on four occasions. Mbappe registered 44 goals in his debut season with Los Blancos and has already reached 38 across 31 games this term. He is desperate to land major honours in 2026.

Arbeloa, who is working as interim boss at the Bernabeu, sees no reason why Mbappe should not be setting his sights on Ronaldo and a place in the history books. He told reporters after witnessing another impressive performance against Valencia: “We thought we wouldn't see anything like Cristiano, but [Mbappe] is on track. Right now he's the best player in the world for sure.

“What Cristiano did looked like something out of this world and impossible to match, as if nobody could come close. Kylian has a long path, because Cris was here for many years. But Kylian has the qualities to follow his path. You never know. If anyone can do it, it's Kylian.”

Mbappe joined Real as a free agent in the summer of 2024 after reaching the end of his contract at Paris Saint-Germain. He is the all-time leading scorer for the Ligue 1 giants, with 235 goals being recorded for them.

Ronaldo told La Sexta after seeing Mbappe follow in his footsteps by taking the No.9 jersey in Madrid: “Take care of him. Take care of him. I'm telling the Real Madrid fans... Take care of the kid. Mbappe is very good and Real Madrid has to help him and protect him. I have no doubt that Mbappe will bring a lot of joy to Real Madrid fans.”

Mbappe has spoken of his admiration for CR7 on a regular basis, but insists that he feels under no pressure to try and emulate the iconic Portuguese. He has said: “I don't feel the pressure. I don't think about Cristiano, with all due respect to him. Cristiano is my idol, yes. But no, I don't want to follow anything. I don't want that pressure. I want to be Kylian. I only have the pressure of having to adapt to the team.”

While Mbappe is trying to be himself in Spain, avoiding inevitable comparisons with Ronaldo, CR7 has advised the World Cup winner to take inspiration from how he played under the brightest of spotlights - with confidence required in order to be a success in Madrid.

The five-time Ballon d'Or winner added when asked for the advice that he would offer to a fearsome French frontman that now fills the No.10 shirt, with Mbappe having arrived at Real as more of a left winger than a central striker: “The forward position makes things a bit complicated for Mbappe, because he doesn't know how to play as a forward in my opinion... It's not that he doesn't know how, it's not his position.

“If I were at Real Madrid I would teach him to play as a nine. Because I wasn't a striker. I got used to playing as a striker. I used to play on the wing and people forget. Kylian shouldn't be a typical striker. If I were him, I would play more or less like Cristiano Ronaldo plays as a striker.”

Mbappe has won the UEFA Super Cup and Intercontinental Cup with Real, but is still waiting on his first piece of domestic silverware. Arbeloa's side are just one point adrift of Clasico rivals Barcelona in La Liga at present, with a thrilling fight to the finish being lined up there.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Erling Haaland has brutally assessed his own recent performances for Manchester City, refusing to use burnout as an excuse for his ongoing goal drought from open play. The Norwegian striker fired City to a dramatic victory at Anfield to reignite the title race but insists he must be ""sharper"" and deliver goals rather than looking for easy outs regarding the schedule.

Haaland has issued a scathing review of his own recent form, insisting that he has ""no excuse"" for his lack of potency in front of goal since the turn of the year. Despite playing the hero in City's victory over Liverpool at Anfield, the Norwegian superstar rejected suggestions that a congested fixture list is to blame for a dry spell that has seen him fail to score from open play in his last eight Premier League outings.

The City number nine was the catalyst for a stunning turnaround on Merseyside this weekend. With Pep Guardiola's side trailing late on, Haaland turned provider to set up Bernardo Silva's equaliser before keeping his nerve to slot home an injury-time penalty.

However, the euphoria of the result has not blinded Haaland to his own dipping standards. While his goal tally remains elite, his overall contribution during January and early February has drawn scrutiny. Speaking after the game, the 25-year-old was visibly self-critical, acknowledging that his output has fallen below the stratospheric bar he set upon his arrival in England.

""I haven't scored enough goals since the start of this year, you can say, and I know that I need to improve,"" Haaland told reporters. ""I know I need to be more sharp, better at all of this and this is something that I have to work on. I have to keep going because this is what everyone deserves and expects.""

City's recent wobble has coincided with a punishing schedule and the absence of key attacking partner Omar Marmoush, who was away with Egypt at the Africa Cup of Nations. The lack of rotation options placed a heavy physical burden on Haaland, leading many pundits to suggest that the striker is suffering from burnout.

Haaland, however, has little time for such narratives. When offered the chance to blame fatigue for his sluggish displays, he firmly shut it down.

""I don't want to speak about why I haven't performed. I don't think there's any excuse,"" he asserted. ""Fatigue is a lot is in the head. It's a lot of games. Look at the schedule, it's not easy, and for me, it's about staying fit, don't get injured. That's the most important thing. And try to be ready to help the team.""

It speaks volumes about Haaland's quality that even amidst a ""crisis"" of confidence, he remains the Premier League's most lethal marksman. His penalty at Anfield took him to 21 league goals for the 2025-26 campaign, keeping him four clear of Brentford sensation Igor Thiago in the race for the Golden Boot.

The penalty against Liverpool was a welcome relief, breaking a psychological dam, but the fact remains that open-play goals have been unusually hard to come by.

The victory at Liverpool feels like a potential turning point in the season. Having seemingly drifted out of contention, Guardiola's men are now six points behind Arsenal. For Haaland, the focus is now singular: turning this ""clutch"" performance into a sustained run of form.

City face a relentless run of fixtures in February, taking on Fulham on Wednesday before a weekend FA Cup clash against Salford. Matches against Newcastle and Leeds follow to close out the month. If Haaland can truly banish the ""fatigue"" from his head and rediscover his sharpness, City's pursuit of silverware on multiple fronts is very much alive. The rest of the league has been warned: the sleeping giant is awake, and he is not looking for excuses.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Our expert offers his best Everton vs Bournemouth predictions and betting tips as the hosts aim to leapfrog their Merseyside rivals Liverpool.

Bournemouth have won only two of their 12 away games this season. Meanwhile, Everton's key creative player, Jack Grealish, will miss the rest of 25/26.

Everton return to the Hill Dickinson Stadium on Wednesday to face AFC Bournemouth. A victory would allow the hosts to move ahead of their local rivals, Liverpool, in the league standings.

The Toffees are unbeaten in their last five Premier League matches, winning two and drawing three. This run has eliminated any relegation concerns for David Moyes' team, allowing them to focus on finishing the season as strongly as possible.

However, they've only won a third of their home games in their new stadium, recording four draws and four defeats. Regarding player availability, Moyes' squad is nearly at full strength. The main absentee is loan winger Jack Grealish, who is set to miss the rest of the season due to ankle surgery. It's a big setback considering Grealish has contributed eight goals and assists in 17 appearances.

Andoni Iraola's Bournemouth started the season with exceptional form before experiencing a decline during the autumn, which removed them from the race for European qualification. The Cherries have since recovered and are on a five-game unbeaten streak.

Bournemouth's home form has been the reason for their current top-half position. They average just 0.92 points and conceded a staggering 30 goals in just 12 away matches. Despite these defensive struggles, they are difficult to defeat away from home, having drawn 42% of those fixtures, in line with the 1xBet Promo Code.

Everton expected lineup: Pickford, Mykolenko, O'Brien, Tarkowski, Keane, Gueye, Garner, Armstrong, Dewsbury-Hall, Ndiaye, Barry

AFC Bournemouth expected lineup: Petrovic, Truffert, Jimenez, Senesi, Hill, Cook, Scott, Rayan, Adli, Kroupi, Evanilson

Statistically, 37.50% of Everton's home matches and Bournemouth's away games have resulted in draws. Despite this, the betting markets suggest there's only a 29.41% chance of a draw on Tuesday night. Therefore, this is the value play from our trio of Everton vs Bournemouth predictions, in line with the 1xBet App Download for users accessing the platform.

Although Bournemouth are prolific on home soil, they've found scoring more difficult on the road. They've netted just 17 goals in 12 away games. Similarly, Everton have scored just 15 goals in 12 home games, while conceding only 16.

Both teams have scored in six of Everton's last seven EPL games. Meanwhile, that trend is even stronger for Bournemouth, with nine of their last ten EPL matches resulting in both teams scoring.

Although both teams are likely to score, Everton are expected to prevent the match from becoming the high-tempo, end-to-end contest that Bournemouth prefer. An entertaining draw appears to be the most likely result.

Everton have conceded the opening goal in four of their last four EPL games. Given that the Toffees have struggled to control games in their new stadium, there is a strong possibility that this trend will continue.

Bournemouth have scored first in their last three away games. This includes opening goals in challenging away trips to Chelsea and Brighton, as well as against bottom-placed Wolves. In fact, they've scored first in 58% of their away games this season, significantly higher than the league average of 38%. Everton have also trailed at halftime in 50% of their home games.

Iraola's men will aim to score early to silence the Hill Dickinson crowd. The likes of Kroupi, Adli, and Evanilson have the pace and agility to test a relatively slow Everton defence.

Although Bournemouth have scored in 92% of their away games this season, Everton have kept clean sheets in 33% of their home matches. Following the loss of Jack Grealish, Moyes is already working hard to develop new offensive strategies.

One team has scored three goals in three of their last four match-ups at Everton. However, Everton's current defence may be more difficult for Bournemouth to break through. Moyes' tall and aerially dominant backline has proven effective against other creative teams this season.

Everton restricted Albion—a team with an attacking style similar to Bournemouth's—to just 1.44 xG. They also kept a clean sheet at Aston Villa last month, preventing Unai Emery's in-form side from creating any big chances. Backing Under 2.5 goals at a probability of just 52.63% seems like another smart play.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Just when you thought Manchester City were dropping out of this Premier League title race for good, Bernardo Silva and Erling Haaland pulled them back in, leaving Liverpool shell-shocked and Arsenal nervously checking over their shoulders. City have never enjoyed playing at Anfield, but Sunday's was a performance like no other, and with an outcome not seen since all the way back in 2003.

The last time City won at Anfield in front of fans, Maine Road was still their home stadium, Kevin Keegan was their manager and Peter Schmeichel was their goalkeeper. It is the only arena that Pep Guardiola fares worse at than the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, and this might have been the coach's last-ever visit there if rumours that this is to be the coach's final season at City are to be believed.

If that turns out to be the case, then Guardiola could not have wished for a better final act. City played far better than they usually do when visiting the red half of Merseyside, but after bossing the first half, the visitors seemed to lose their grip on the game as the Reds rallied and took the lead through Dominik Szoboszlai's sizzling free-kick. 

It was the latest example of City fading in the second half, and their title hopes were disappearing too. But, inspired by a captain in Bernardo who never stopped believing and who pulled them back into contention with his 82nd-minute equaliser, City staged a late siege, sealed by a Haaland penalty and preserved by a wonder save from Gianluigi Donnarumma. And that's without mentioning the bedlam at the end which saw Rayan Cherki's goal from the halfway line ruled out and Szoboszlai subsequently sent off.

Guardiola was taunted by Liverpool fans in his last visit to Anfield, feeling the need to put six fingers up in response so as to remind his detractors how many Premier League titles he has won. He had the last laugh this time, though, and so too did Haaland, who scored for the first time at Liverpool's home in a City shirt. On a day of firsts for City, the club also did the double over Liverpool in the league for the first time since 1937.

Although the Reds might have forgotten what it was like to lose at home to City (apart from in the coronavirus-affected season), there was plenty of deja-vu about the manner of this defeat. It was the fourth time this season that Arne Slot's side have conceded a 90th-minute winner, already the joint-most by a team in a single Premier League campaign, and it leaves the Reds needing to stage a big turnaround of their own to prevent them ending up in the Europa League next season. 

GOAL breaks down the winners & losers from Anfield...

The last time Haaland scored at Anfield he was almost an unknown figure, a baby-faced 19-year-old with a military haircut, playing for Red Bull Salzburg. A lot has changed in his life since he scored in a 4-3 defeat for the Austrians back in the Champions League in September 2019, but Anfield must have felt like a fortress he would never penetrate again.

Haaland had lost on two of his three previous visits with City without scoring, and the game seemed to be following a familiar script when he missed an early one-vs-one with Alisson before his side fell behind with 16 minutes to go. But Haaland did not become the best striker in the world without being resilient, and he kept his faith and kept on fighting for every ball.

He out-jumped Ibrahima Konate to lay on the equaliser for Bernardo, and when he picked the ball up to take the penalty, he banished all thoughts of his previous trips to Anfield with City from his mind before firing into the bottom corner to spark wild celebrations.

Hugo Ekitike went into this game as the in-form striker after his double against Newcastle the previous week earned him comparisons to Fernando Torres in his Anfield pomp. His name was also sung throughout by the home fans, but unfortunately for Ekitike, he failed the big test. 

The France international was given a rough ride by Marc Guehi and thus struggled in the first half. He did, however, look reinvigorated for the second period as he emerged as the Liverpool player must likely to find a breakthrough. But he never did.

Ekitike missed two of Liverpool's best chances, curling wide of goal after the ball was worked to him at the back post before he got his angles wrong when Mohamed Salah set him up for a free header, nodding just wide of the far post.

Ekitike has had a strong first season at Liverpool, especially compared to his fellow new arrival Alexander Isak, but he has fallen short in the big games, having failed to score against any of Manchester United, Arsenal, Real Madrid and now twice against City.

In early September, Guehi underwent a medical ahead of a transfer to Liverpool. Six months later, he was playing at Anfield, but received boos every time he touched the ball from the home fans for ultimately joining City instead of the Reds.

Guehi's change of destination was not his choice, as his proposed move to Liverpool fell apart due to Crystal Palace blocking his exit. But Guehi always felt that he belonged on the biggest stages, and it was in this environment, in a pressure-cooker atmosphere and with the Premier League title still on the line, that he utterly thrived.

Guehi knocked away Liverpool's through-balls with ease from start to finish, frustrating Ekitike, Cody Gakpo and above all Florian Wirtz, from whom he made a brave diving block to keep out the German's shot. He also frustrated Mohamed Salah and the 57,000 Liverpool fans when he hauled the Egyptian down just outside the box, earning a yellow card when the crowd demanded a red.

It was the one occasion in which the England international made a misjudgement, and Guehi's near flawless performance underlined exactly what City have gained by signing him - and exactly what the Reds have missed out on.

Alisson's consistency had been one of the big reasons why City had only won once at Anfield under Guardiola, and never with fans present. But in the end, it was an uncharacteristic lapse from the Brazil goalkeeper which changed this game's trajectory.

Alisson had performed as we have all come to expect, smothering Haaland in the first minute of the game before later getting across his goal to catch Antoine Semenyo's effort.

His usual presence of mind, however, went out the window in added time when he came flying out of his goal and took out Matheus Nunes. The City right-back had an almost impossible angle and all Alisson had to do was stand up to him and let him touch it out of play. Instead, he made a reckless decision to challenge Nunes for the ball, which was on its way off the pitch, and got there hopelessly late.

It gave Liverpool the last thing they wanted: a free shot at goal from 12 yards out for Haaland, and the striker duly punished Alisson.

Most Manchester United fans would find it hard to pick a side in this fixture between their two biggest rivals, but the late drama at Anfield would have been quietly celebrated by Red Devils supporters. In the space of eight minutes, United's two-point gap over Liverpool in the race for Champions League football widened to five.

Those of a Chelsea persuasion will also have been pleased by the outcome, as their one-point advantage over Arne Slot's side suddenly became a four-point difference. 

Liverpool's late collapse should give United and Chelsea more belief that they can finish above the Reds and among the Premier League's top five, behind Arsenal, City and Aston Villa. United are in unstoppable form under Michael Carrick while Chelsea also seem refreshed by their change in manager, with Liam Rosenior having won all four of his Premier League matches since succeeding Enzo Maresca, too.

Last month, Slot brought up the fact that Liverpool were in the Europa League just two years in an attempt to show how far the Reds had come under his watch by securing their passage to the last 16 of the Champions League for the second year running. But on current evidence, his side are heading back into Europe's secondary competition.

Arsenal's players have shown few signs that they are feeling the heat from City, responding to their recent defeat to United by easing to 4-0 and 3-0 wins over Leeds and Sunderland, respectively. Sunday's late show from City at Anfield does not necessarily mean that the Gunners are less likely to win their next league games at Brentford or Wolves, or even Tottenham.

But spare a thought for all those Arsenal fans who have recurring nightmares of City closing the gap on their team and overhauling them in the title races of 2022-23 and 2023-24. All Gunners supporters want is a little reassurance that this is going to be their year at last and that there are going to be no more nasty surprises. 

City's last-gasp heroics, then, are only going to bring back bad memories and do bad things for their blood pressure.

Three Tottenham Hotspur vs Newcastle United predictions for their Premier League clash on Wednesday night, including value on a goalscorer pick.

Our betting expert expects both teams to deliver. However, there is a strong possibility points will be shared.

Both teams are struggling for form in their respective Premier League campaigns. While they're flying in the Champions League and into the knockout phase, there have been struggles on the domestic front.

Tottenham sank to new lows over the weekend, as they were beaten 2-0 by Manchester United. The result left them 15th in the league, just six points above 18th-placed West Ham. The worst part is that they're one point worse off than they were at the same stage last season.

Judging by Ange Postecoglou's fate, Thomas Frank's job isn't safe, regardless of his team's excellence in Europe. There's certainly pressure on the manager to deliver victories for the home fans, who haven't celebrated a win since December.

Eddie Howe isn't under the same kind of pressure in the Newcastle dugout, but there is now added scrutiny. The Magpies suffered a damaging 3-2 defeat at home to Brentford over the weekend. This means they enter this midweek clash in 12th place and four points ahead of the hosts.

The Toon must try to turn things around, as they're only six points behind Liverpool in sixth. As a result, qualifying for Europe again isn't impossible. Still, Howe's charges need to end their current poor run to make it happen.

Tottenham Hotspur expected lineup: Vicario, Palhinha, Dragusin, Van de Ven, Gray, Gallagher, Sarr, Spence, Simons, Odobert, Solanke

Newcastle United expected lineup: Pope, Tripper, Thiaw, Botman, Hall, Willock, Guimaraes, Tonali, Murphy, Wissa, Barnes

Tottenham's home form has been surprisingly poor for a Premier League club. The North London outfit have only won two out of 12 league games in their backyard, losing six (50%) in that run. The weekend's 2-0 defeat made it seven games on the trot without a win. They drew four of those.

Newcastle's results are more in line with what's expected of a team in this league. They've excelled at home, winning seven of 13 games. On the road, the Magpies have won just two of their 12 away games. They have lost six of those fixtures.

Howe's charges are on a three-game losing run, which means both teams are out of form heading into this fixture. The reverse fixture in December ended in a pulsating 2-2 draw, with all four goals arriving in the second half. A similar outcome is expected on Tuesday night.

When Tottenham and Newcastle meet, there's hardly ever a shortage of goals and drama. Spurs have failed to win any of their last four home games. They couldn't keep a clean sheet in any of them. Additionally, they've conceded at least two goals in each of the last five league outings.

Surprisingly, Newcastle's struggles on the road have stemmed from their front line. Despite having all the talent up front, only Sunderland (6) and Wolves (5) have scored fewer goals away from home (11). However, considering how poor Spurs' back line have been and Cristian Romero suspended, the visitors should get some joy here.

Five of Tottenham's last six games in the league saw both teams score on the day. Meanwhile, 13 of Newcastle's previous 18 games in the Premier League produced goals at both ends. All three of their most recent head-to-heads in this competition saw both Spurs and Newcastle get onto the scoresheet.

It's also notable that this fixture holds the Premier League record for the most games without a 0-0 draw. It's happened 61 times already, and this one should see some goals scored. You can keep up with the action and place bets conveniently using the 1xBet App.

Two weeks ago, Solanke scored a brace to help Tottenham earn a point against Manchester City. However, Man United kept him relatively quiet, as he failed to register a single shot, despite having six touches in their box.

Solanke hopes to get back onto the scoresheet against a team he has a good record against. The former Bournemouth man has scored four goals in his last three personal head-to-heads with Newcastle.

With four goals in his last five club appearances, the forward is likely to get some joy for the hosts on Tuesday night, and you can enhance their game day experience by using our 1xBet Promo Code for exclusive betting offers.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

No. 97 Luca Nardi, +7
Nardi is back in the Top 100 following victories against Nikoloz Basilashvili and Flavio Cobolli in Montpellier.

No. 120 Titouan Droguet, +30 (Career High)
Droguet has jumped to a career-high No. 120 after he came through qualifying in Montpellier to reach his first tour-level semi-final in Montpellier. The 24-year-old beat seed Tallon Griekspoor in the quarter-finals but couldn't overcome Auger-Aliassime in the semis.

No. 130 Martin Damm, +30 (Career High)
Like Droguet, Damm has moved 30 places after reaching the Montpellier semis as a qualifier. The 22-year-old American saved a match point in qualifying and then defeated former Top 10 stars Hubert Hurkacz and Roberto Bautista Agut to advance to the last four at a tour-level event for the first time.

The world's biggest celebrities often gather at the Super Bowl. On Sunday, Roger Federer was one of the global icons in attendance for the Seattle Seahawks' win against the New England Patriots.

This was not the first time the ATP No. 1 Club member has been at the biggest NFL game of the year. Federer also attended the Super Bowl while he was the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings in 2008. 

“I was at the Super Bowl in '08 in Arizona when Tom Brady was going for the perfect season and then we had the catch, I remember, on the helmet, from the Giants to win the game that Eli Manning passed,” Federer said in a social media interview with the NFL. “So that was my favourite memory obviously of being in the stadium.”

Other celebrities in attendance include Bon Jovi, Chris Pratt, Justin Bieber, Kendall Jenner, Lewis Hamilton and Kim Kardashian. Bad Bunny headlined the halftime show. 

Before the game, Federer was asked which Super Bowl halftime show has been his favourite.

“From YouTube, everything I saw, [it] was Michael Jackson, the moment when he comes and he shows up, that was awesome. Then I liked Eminem and 50 Cent and Dr. Dre,” Federer said. “That's music I also grew up with.”

Novak Djokovic is no stranger to excellence, and on Sunday evening he found himself appreciating it from a different perspective.

Just seven days after reaching his 11th Australian Open final, where he fell to World No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz, the 38-year-old Serbian attended the figure skating team event at the Winter Olympic Games in Milano Cortina.





Djokovic, sitting alongside his wife Jelena, was visibly captivated by 21-year-old phenom Ilia Malinin after he had helped the United States to Olympic gold.

“I did see Djokovic, it's so unreal,” Malinin said after his skate. “I heard that after I landed my backflip, he had his hands over his head. That's incredible. That's a once-in-a-lifetime moment: Seeing a famous tennis player watching my performance… I'm absolutely blown away.”

A post shared by TNT Sports (@tntsports)

The Olympic Games hold special meaning for Djokovic. In Paris in 2024, he completed one of the final missing pieces of his resume, defeating Lexus ATP Head2Head rivals Rafael Nadal and Alcaraz en route to his first gold medal. It was a victory he has since called one of the most important of his illustrious career.

Indeed, rumors have swirled since last fall that Serena Williams is planning a return to tennis, having re-entered the World Anti-Doping Authority's testing pool. She was even rumored to be making a major announcement during this weekend's Super Bowl.But though the 23-time Grand Slam champion is yet to confirm a comeback, she could be cleared to return as early as this spring, meaning Mboko could find herself on the court with Williams sooner than she could have ever imagined.In the meantime, the Canadian is getting plenty of exposure to elite athletes, competing alongside Coco Gauff in women's doubles this week in Doha and taking on former world No. 2 Vera Zvonareva in her second-round singles match.

At 28 years old, Michael Mmoh is entering an important phase of his career, and he's chosen a special place to be a part of it. This fortnight, the American is playing the Tenerife Challenger for the first time; taking place across two tournaments at the Abama Tennis Academy in Guía de Isora, it offers players an ideal early-season platform. While winter still dominates much of Europe and North America, Tenerife—located in the Atlantic Ocean—provides mild temperatures, sunshine, and excellent outdoor hard courts, creating perfect conditions to train and compete at a high level.With its reliable weather, professional facilities, and relaxed atmosphere, the biggest of the Canary Islands has become a popular stop on the ATP Challenger Tour and an ideal destination for top-level tennis in February.Career highlights and a strong start to 2026Mmoh, who turned professional in 2016, is currently world No. 238 and reached a career-high ranking of No. 81 in September of 2023. Mmoh is a seven-time ATP Challenger Tour champion, with all of his titles coming on hard courts and all on home soil in the United States. His last triumph came in 2022, and he enjoyed his best season in 2023 by reaching the fourth round at both the Australian Open and the US Open.He opened the 2026 season strongly with a quarterfinal run at the ATP 250 Hong Kong Tennis Open, highlighted by a victory over No. 4 seed Karen Khachanov, one of the biggest wins of his career.

First impressions of TenerifeHis first impressions of Tenerife could hardly be more positive.“It's a beautiful place,"" Mmoh said. ""It's my first time here in Tenerife.

Staying healthy, building momentumAfter being sidelined from the court many times, Mmoh is focused on building momentum.“I had a couple of injuries the last two years, which was tough,"" he said. ""But that's part of being a professional tennis player. There're ups and downs. At the end of the day, I did everything to stay healthy. I was happy to start the year the way I did, beating Khachanov and other great players. That gives me confidence that this is going to be great year for me.""I've got what it takes, and I feel like staying healthy. There's no reason I can't do that.""Asked about his goals, the Washington Commanders fan was clear and realistic.""The biggest target for sure is to stay healthy and play a full calendar year,"" he said. ""I haven't done that in some time. Ranking-wise, I want to see myself back in the Top 100, and then go from there. I can definitely go for more, but I want to do one step at a time.”

The conditions in Tenerife seem to suit his game well.“The courts here are unique. They are on the slower end for sure, but it suits me. I am a good athlete. I can play physical tennis. The rallies are going to be a bit longer here. I have the ability to play well on these courts,” Mmoh said, underlining why the island is such an attractive stop for players looking to compete outdoors in February.An eye on the big stageEven while focusing on his own season, Mmoh keeps a close eye on the biggest stages. Reflecting on recent Grand Slam action at the Australian Open, he added: “Both matches, [Carlos] Alcaraz vs. [Alexander] Zverev and [Jannik] Sinner vs. [Novak] Djokovic, were incredible level. It was great for the fans to have these two matches on the same day. It was a treat for tennis.”For Mmoh, Tenerife is more than just another tournament stop. It's a chance to build confidence, stay healthy, compete in ideal outdoor conditions, and, as he put it himself, to enjoy a “spectacular place” that might just be the perfect office for the next two weeks.

While Serena's appearance was virtual, Federer was in-person at Levi's Stadium, and he didn't just get camera time along the pre-game sideline.The Swiss great was also featured on the NFL's social media, where he recalled his favorite Super Bowl memory.Federer detailed how he was on hand, in-person in Arizona, for one of the Patriots' most infamous appearances back in 2008, when they entered the game against the New York Giants with an undefeated 18-0 record. While New England led for much of that game, Giants quaterback Eli Manning famously connected with his receiver David Tyree as time was winding down for the game-winning touchdown, with Tyree famously keeping the play alive by catching the ball on his helmet.“That was my favorite memory, obviously, of being in the stadium,"" he said.

Oscar Piastri reflects on 'tough lessons' and his goals for 2026

Lando Norris 'proved to myself that I have what it takes' after title success

While the pecking order is unknown ahead of 2026, McLaren CEO Zak Brown is hopeful about how the team will perform.

Zak Brown believes that the early signs indicate McLaren will be “competitive” in 2026, with the CEO also expecting that there could be some “fascinating” effects from this season's new technical regulations.

While the papaya squad arrive into the campaign as the reigning champions in both titles – marking back-to-back Teams' crowns following their 2024 triumph – the pecking order remains uncertain given the introduction of a rules reset.

However, following the Barcelona Shakedown, Brown feels that the team look in good shape for the season ahead – though cautioned that it is still too soon to predict what could happen.

“I think it's very early days – very risky to judge [the Barcelona Shakedown],” Brown explained in a media session amid McLaren's season launch on Monday.

“What I would say is we feel like we'll be competitive. The top four teams all seemed very competitive, so very early days but the indication's that we'll be strong.

“But I think it would be premature to make any predictions beyond an initial few days of testing. Obviously things will start to become a little bit clearer over the next two weeks.”

Pushed for his thoughts on the driving aspect of the new cars following the regulation changes – with Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri having both gained their first mileage of the 2026 challenger in Barcelona – Brown responded: “I think the drivers like to drive the cars.

“Understanding the energy deployment and how to maximise a lap, I think it's starting to become clear to the drivers how they're going to race.

“I think until we get into racing conditions we ultimately won't know, so I think, given that two weeks ago was a shakedown and get going, we need some more days under our belt to really understand how these cars are going to race best.

“As Lando said, it could get quite exciting because I do think you can get it right or you can get it wrong, and I think the consequences of getting it wrong, you could potentially be freight-trained if you run out of deployment in certain parts of the track, so it could be fascinating. We need to wait and see.”

McLaren's drivers will next have the opportunity to experience the MCL40 when official pre-season testing gets underway in Bahrain, with a first test taking place from February 11-13 before a second follows on February 18-20.

Lando Norris 'proved to myself that I have what it takes' after title success

It's almost Super Bowl time, so there's no better time to break down all the crossovers between F1 and American football, including investors, collaborations and a special livery reveal round the corner...

It's Super Bowl Sunday! Across the world, millions will be tuning in to watch the Seattle Seahawks take on the New England Patriots for the Vince Lombardi Trophy, along with a blockbuster halftime show from Bad Bunny. Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara is hosting Super Bowl LX, leaving many viewers facing a tough time zone difference, but racing fans planning to stay up will get a special Formula 1 treat partway through the game...

Our newest team Cadillac are fully leaning into their American roots, announcing their 2026 livery during a Super Bowl television advert. The first look of the design that Sergio Perez and Valtteri Bottas' will be driving is sure to be a highlight of the evening, but it's far from the first time that American football and F1 have crossed paths.

Whether it's the Miami Grand Prix's incorporation of the NFL stadium, the various investments from drivers and players in each other's sports, or the many cameos made by NFL stars at race weekends, the two sports have more in common than ever before. Let's explore all the connections between the two as we approach kick-off in the NFL season finale...

Back in early December, Cadillac announced that they were revealing their debut livery during one of the coveted Super Bowl commercial breaks – another fresh idea to reveal a design. With this reveal, the American team are continuing to build their North American fan base that came with the hiring of Mexican Perez and test driver Coltan Herta.

We will get to see their 2026 contender during Bahrain testing in the coming weeks, having seen it adorned in the special shakedown livery in Barcelona, as they build up to their maiden F1 season.

American football and racing are never closer than during the Miami Grand Prix race weekend. Debuting in 2022, the Miami International Autodrome was designed around the Hard Rock Stadium, home of the NFL's Miami Dolphins.

There are two paddocks at the track – one near the pit lane and another situated inside the stadium itself. The field becomes home to media facilities and team buildings, but the grass still sees footballing action, as Dolphins players regularly come down to teach the grid some skills.

Kicking, throwing and catching drills are a highlight for the drivers, despite their consistent struggles, but they'll feel better seeing some of the NFL players reactions to speed. McLaren's Oscar Piastri flexed some of his racing muscles when giving Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa a hot lap – an experience that certainly thrilled if not scared the American!

Given the size of both sports, it was inevitable that big players in both worlds would see opportunity in the other. Lewis Hamilton has a diverse range of interests, but recently American football has been at the forefront of his mind.

In 2022, the seven-time World Champion became part owner of the three-time Super Bowl-winning Denver Broncos. Since then, Hamilton has attended several games and followed the Broncos' journey to the AFC Championship game religiously, as they agonisingly fell to the Patriots 10-7.

In 2023, this time it was the turn of some of the NFL's biggest stars to invest in motorsport. Kansas City Chiefs' Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce, winners of three Super Bowls as team mates, joined Otro Capital's consortium that invested into Alpine. Quarterback Mahomes checked out his new favourite team at last year's Miami Grand Prix, and he'll be hoping the French outfit improve from last year's struggles thanks to the new regulations.

We couldn't mention the NFL without bringing up eight-time race winner Daniel Ricciardo. The Australian was looking for a franchise to follow, but after meeting Buffalo Bills quarterback and future NFL MVP Josh Allen in 2019, his heart was set.

The pair became good friends, and Ricciardo has been a superfan ever since, eventually making it to his first Bills game in Buffalo in 2024. The 36-year-old even got the chance to catch a football from the legendary Tom Brady in 2019, with the American launching a ball from yacht to yacht in Monaco – a memorable moment for Daniel!

Elite athletes love getting a taste of the action at some huge sporting events, and it's no different when it comes to NFL and F1 stars. The introduction of the Las Vegas Grand Prix in 2023 was a golden opportunity for the grid to take advantage of the city and catch some NFL action, with Lando Norris, Carlos Sainz, and Alex Albon all visiting the Las Vegas Raiders last year at the start of race week. Elsewhere, Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson visited the Los Angeles Rams in 2024, even getting on the pitch for some pictures with the players!

There have been countless NFL icons who have been drawn to the spectacle of F1 over the years. Dallas Cowboys duo Dak Prescott and CeeDee Lamb paid a visit to the Red Bull garage in Miami in 2023, while last year, former LA Rams champions Jalen Ramsey and Odell Beckham Jr made it to the grid in Florida, along with legendary running back Derrick Henry.

Brothers T.J. and J.J. Watt, who have four NFL Defensive Player of the Year awards between them, were invited to the Haas garage for the 2022 Miami Grand Prix – even finding time to take on some pitstop challenges! Another guest of Red Bull in Miami last year, 2022 NFL Offensive Player of the Year Justin Jefferson also had a go with the wheel gun, although he looked slightly bemused by the technology.

Some older players have also made appearances in days gone by – including seven-time Super Bowl champion Brady, who caught up with Nico Rosberg at the 2016 Monaco Grand Prix. His former Patriots team mate Rob Gronkowski was seen in Miami last year, and former Cincinnati Bengals receiver Chad Ochocinco Johnson was in Vegas for Max Verstappen's 2025 win. Hall of Famer Michael Strahan was a guest of McLaren for last year's Dutch Grand Prix, while Hamilton and 2014 Super Bowl champion Russell Wilson met up before the 2018 Canadian Grand Prix.

Actor and television host Terry Crews has become a regular in the paddock over the past few seasons, with the ‘White Chicks' star even becoming a member of the post-race interviews line-up in Vegas. The pairing has become a natural fit given Crews' charisma and the ever-growing flair of the North American race weekends.

But did you know that Crews is a former professional football player? Between 1991 and 1997, he played in the NFL as a defensive end and linebacker for several teams, including the Green Bay Packers and San Diego Chargers, before heading into acting and presenting. And we're pretty glad he made the switch!

Not only has Crews captivated the F1 audiences – he's provided some pretty unforgettable viral moments – who could forget when he chaperoned Verstappen, Norris and George Russell to the Las Vegas podium in the pink Lego Cadillac?

Netflix's Drive to Survive and America's Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders have been two of the biggest shows on the platform, and the two came together at the 2024 United States Grand Prix in Texas. Based not far from the Circuit of The Americas, the NFL team's cheerleaders were everywhere during the race weekend, getting pictures with drivers, performing on the grid, and even waving the flag as Ferrari claimed a one-two with Charles Leclerc and Sainz.

Lando Norris 'proved to myself that I have what it takes' after title success

With Adrian Newey's maiden Aston Martin design emerging at the end of the Barcelona Shakedown, its dramatic looks have gotten plenty of people talking.

The Aston Martin AMR26 certainly caused a stir when it emerged from the garage on the fourth day of the Barcelona Shakedown, ahead of the team's official launch tonight. As the first Adrian Newey-conceived Aston Martin it has been perhaps the most eagerly anticipated of all the new 2026 cars but, in its dramatic looks and extreme engineering solutions, it exceeded even the wildest expectations.

From the tip of its ‘pelican' nose to the tail of its rear wing pillar-mounted suspension arms, it's radically different to any other car. The heavily downward-ramped sidepods, housed around tiny radiator horizontal inlets look more like tubes than pods – and are similar in this respect to the Red Bull RB22.

However, in this case they do not run down to the floor edge, leaving a huge expanse of floor to feed between the diffuser wall and rear wheel. A big cooling exit duct is incorporated just below the cockpit between the sidepod tubes and engine cover.

As with the Red Bull, the sidepod shape implies that a big proportion of the radiator area – including probably the intercooler – may in fact be sited upwards and in the centre of the car.

The front pushrod suspension has its upper rearwards wishbone mounted even further back than on the McLaren, giving the upper wishbone layout an enormous offset triangular shape in plan view. In profile the arms appear to form an aerodynamic cascade to boost the airflow.

But the most radical part of the car is at the rear. The upper arms of the pushrod layout are mounted incredibly high and attach to the centre where the rear wing mount runs.

Structurally, this isn't new; several teams – notably Williams and Red Bull – designed cars in the early 2010s with the wishbones attached to a super-strong central mount, with the wing support running around it. But they were not mounted anywhere near as high as this.

Not only does it create a clear unobstructed space for the diffuser exit but it could potentially even serve as a part-replacement for the now-banned beam wing.

Although the arms cannot by regulation be aerofoil shaped in profile, they way they are mounted, together with a degree of rake in the car itself could certainly induce at least part of that beam wing function of connecting up the flow exiting the diffuser and that being fed to the rear wing underside.

The front wing looks much plainer than those seen on other cars and is probably not the final version.

The nose is as wide as the Red Bull's. This wide nose/narrow sidepod combination is shared with the Red Bull and could be about maximising the high-pressure area behind the front wheels to direct the wheel wake outward far enough to clear the front of the sidepod and thereafter be pulled into that expanse of exposed floor feeding the rear.

Little is known about the new Honda power unit which drives through Aston Martin's own gearbox (a first) but the progress of this incredible-looking design is sure to be monitored very closely by everyone as the season gets underway.

The Seahawks beat out the New England Patriots 29-13, while Bad Bunny served as the halftime headliner. 


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



	Hollywood is reacting to the Seattle Seahawks winning Super Bowl LX.


	After dominating the majority of the big event, the Seahawks triumphed over the New England Patriots on Sunday at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. The win marks their second Super Bowl championship ever; this was also their fourth time playing in the big game. 




Chris Pratt, an avid supporter of the Seahawks, shared a series of videos and photos celebrating the team's win. In his post, he appeared on the field with the team and also in the locker room with quarterback Sam Darnold.

	“What a season! So endlessly proud to be one of the 12s! This team showed such grit and faith through the whole season. It's gonna be a while before my voice comes back,” Pratt wrote in the caption of his post. “Super Bowl Champions! Nobody can ever take that away from these men. What an awesome experience. Thanks to the whole @seahawks organization for the access! Go hawks!”


	The Guardians of the Galaxy actor notably introduced the Seattle-based team just before kickoff. (Jon Bon Jovi introduced the Patriots.)


Joel McHale merely posted a photo of the aftermath following the Seahawks win on Instagram, with the Levi's Stadium being flooded by blue and green confetti. Former President Barack Obama shared a celebratory X post, where he wrote, “Congratulations to the Super Bowl champion @Seahawks! This defense was special. MVP Kenneth Walker was dominant. And Sam Darnold gave us one of the best comeback stories in a long time. Enjoy the celebration.”


	Russell Wilson, who formerly played with the Seattle-based team from 2012-21, commemorated their win on X, writing, “Go Hawks!”

	











	Plenty of stars were inside Levi's Stadium to watch the 2026 Super Bowl, including the likes of Jay-Z, Adam Sandler, Travis Kelce, Travis Scott, Keke Palmer, Jon Bon Jovi, Chris Pratt, Justin and Hailey Bieber, Kendall Jenner, 21 Savage, Tracy Morgan, Daniel Radcliffe and Rob Lowe, among others.


	Several notable artists were in the building to perform during the big championship game, including Bad Bunny, who headlined the Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show. Ahead of the game, Green Day led the pre-game performance, while Charlie Puth sang the National Anthem, Brandi Carlile performed “America the Beautiful,” and Coco Jones sang “Lift Every Voice and Sing.”


	And that certainly wasn't the end of the star-studded Super Bowl performances, as celebrities dominated the commercials in between breaks. Sabrina Carpenter starred in an ad for Pringles, while George Clooney backed Grubhub, Emma Stone repped Squarespace, and Adrien Brody suited up for Turbo Tax. (See more celebrity Super Bowl ads here.)

Go Hawks! 🏆🏆

Congratulations to the Super Bowl champion @Seahawks! This defense was special. MVP Kenneth Walker was dominant. And Sam Darnold gave us one of the best comeback stories in a long time. Enjoy the celebration.

It seems the president didn't agree with the Grammy winner's message of love during the 2026 Super Bowl.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


	While Bad Bunny was expressing love during his 2026 Super Bowl halftime show, Donald Trump decided to react with hate.


	Shortly after the Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show wrapped Sunday night, the president quickly took to Truth Social to share his thoughts on the performance. And to no surprise, as Trump has been outspoken about his disdain for the Grammy winner, he called it “absolutely terrible” and “disgusting.”




	“The Super Bowl Halftime Show is absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER! It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn't represent our standards of Success, Creativity, or Excellence,” Trump wrote. “Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young children that are watching from throughout the U.S.A., and all over the World.”

	The president continued, “This “Show” is just a “slap in the face” to our Country, which is setting new standards and records every single day — including the Best Stock Market and 401(k)s in History! There is nothing inspirational about this mess of a Halftime Show and watch, it will get great reviews from the Fake News Media, because they haven't got a clue of what is going on in the REAL WORLD — And, by the way, the NFL should immediately replace its ridiculous new Kickoff Rule. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! President DONALD J. TRUMP.”

	











	Videos circulated on social media showing Bad Bunny's halftime show playing inside Trump's Super Bowl party at his Mar-a-Lago golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida — instead of Turning Point USA's MAGA-friendly “All American” Halftime Show” alternative with Kid Rock.


	Trump's comments were quite the contrast to the message Bad Bunny shared at the end of his performance: “The only thing more powerful than hate is love.”


	The Puerto Rican rapper and singer not only brought a bit of his culture to the global stage to share with everyone, with a set inspired by his hometown community in Puerto Rico, but he also told a love story throughout his show on football's biggest night.


	Ever since Bad Bunny was announced as this year's Super Bowl headliner, Trump has been critical of the decision, as the “DtMF” singer has been very outspoken against his administration's aggressive immigration enforcement. 


	Most recently, Bad Bunny slammed ICE at the 2026 Grammys during his acceptance speech. He also opted out of holding U.S. stops on his Debí Tirar Más Fotos World Tour due to worries of potential ICE raids at his concerts.


	On Sunday, the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots were battling it out inside Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, for Super Bowl LX, with the Seahawks ultimately taking home the Vince Lombardi Trophy. Check out all the celebrities in attendance here.

From Google to Meta to Microsoft, we were handed a world in which all our cares have been whisked away. Except for all the new ones that have come to take their place.


							By 

	Steven Zeitchik


Senior Editor, Technology and Politics


	Are you feeling like your football-scouting operation has been taking a beating lately?Do you sometimes wonder why your spreadsheets can't get generated fast enough? Or perhaps your software coding is going slower than you always thought it would?Most of all, does your kid struggle with not being able to imagine the decor of his bedroom in your new home?If any of these problems resonate — and really, what could be more universal? — has Silicon Valley got an AI product for you.You may have noticed Sunday night that these four instances were prime AI use cases per a series of Super Bowl ads from the industry's biggest players (Microsoft Copilot, unicorn startup GenSpark, OpenAI‘s Codex and Google Gemini, respectively), either solving challenges that don't exist day-to-day for most Americans or, in the last case, solving a challenge that may actually be a good thing. Any parenting expert will tell you that temporary uncertainty or disappointment can healthily prepare a child for adulthood. But why risk that brief bout of questioning when AI can Magic Erase it from their lives?Of course, we're acting like the removal of a childhood-development moment is a byproduct of AI adoption and not the whole point. While these ads and the dozen or so more that aired during the game— from both established players like Meta and Anthropic and upstarts like Ramp AI and Artlist — have different visions for how machine thinking will help us, they are nearly all united by a common ideology. Namely: Everyday life is unruly, unknown, hard. Wouldn't it be nice if a computer happened along to make it easy and guaranteed?If you arrived unformed into the techno-capitalist parade that is the current iteration of the Super Bowl telecast, you would come to at least one very specific conclusion: technology will soon offload so much of our current toil. “It'll be whatever we want it to be,” the Gemini mother says to her son about their house — AI is apparently manna now — as onscreen a message flashes “A new kind of help from Google.” A more encapsulating set of credos I cannot imagine. Whatever we want! No limitations or consequences! And new help! Who doesn't want that? Well, compared to the current kind of Googling — the kind that requires critical thinking — it certainly is new. Better? Less clear.Tech revolutions at heart change the mechanisms by which humans live. The automobile lessened our reliance on the horse. This new revolution will lessen our need for a brain. Whether we want what this digital Che will wreak is another matter. Yes, on the surface, this ad spate is about AI products, which is about massive capitalizations, and Wall Street valuations, and many other -ations you hear on CNBC. But such talk of companies and products abstract, purposefully, what's really being sold.The abstracting reached its pinnacle (nadir) with an insidious Alexa ad featuring Chris Hemsworth and wife Elsa Pataky. He insisted the smart speaker could go sentient in various wildly extravagant ways and kill him — a classic straw man of painting anyone worried about AI Safety as some kind of tinfoil alarmist while cleverly ignoring the actual dangers, like Alexa's new policy of nonconsensual constant uploading. (See also under Amazon‘s Super Bowl Ring ad for how it saves all the lost dogs while, oh yes, turning on some kind of Big Brother camera for mass surveillance.)“I would never. I'm just here to help,” Alexa tells Hemsworth, which confoundingly seeks to have it both ways: “An AI can't have murderous feelings; that's silly. But it can have feelings of help and love!” (Literally an Alexa ad from earlier this football season starring Pete Davidson has him vulnerably telling a computer screen “I like you, too.”)To think about any of these tech company ads for more than five seconds is to realize how little they stand up to scrutiny. Which is exactly how the brands want it generally: feeling more, thinking less.Of course matters aren't that simple; we're just not that naive anymore. By now too many of us are wary of what's being sold — sensitized by two years of deepfakes and soft slop, chastened by two decades of social media and rage-farming. And indeed, in-between the shiny sales pitches came little glimpses of self-own. Anthropic went after OpenAI for how the latter's ad-based chatbot could be compromised without appearing to realize that asking sensitive information from a chatbot could be dangerous even when it wasn't trying to sell you something. I'm not sure relying on an LLM to tell you how to navigate your relationship with your mother is so wise even if it refrains from pushing a cougar dating site.And Artlist.io, a little-known video-generation platform, pitched its tools to NY and LA markets with an ad the company told us that as a result of those tools took less than a week to create — or rather, a polar bear reading a voiceover script told us that while, on screen, dogs roasted marshmallows, horses ate from craft services and a person in a banana costume surveyed a rocker-destroyed stage, all in an attempt to show how our content landscape will be transformed.

					How Bad Bunny's Super Bowl Halftime Show Put Boricua Culture on the World's Stage		
			









	“Artlist's Big Game debut proves that high-end video production is no longer gated by time, budget, or access,” an accompanying press release touted. No doubt such efficiency boasts land with Madison Avenue beancounters, but the rest of us may find ourselves busier trying to recover from the retinal burning brought on by these proto-assaults of slop. Some 25 million people viewed the spot, by the way, but only 15 commented on it, and most were critical. These ads may not have fooled as many of us as their makers seemed to think. Some brands, at least, respected human intelligence. One standout came from Volkswagen — which went back to its “90's “Drivers Wanted” slogan and the deeply human vibes of its seminal Nick Drake spot from that era (directed by a pre Little Miss Sunshine Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris!) — with a beautifully on-point third-quarter ad. Soundtracked by House of Pain's 90's staple “Jump Around,” the spot showed a young professional guy leaving his laptop life behind to play with his dog; a Gen Z woman dancing in the rain and getting her friends to exit the car to join her; a driver making a U-turn to follow an ice cream truck; and a group in a schoolyard cheering on a besuited corporate worker to kick back their soccer ball over the fence, Messi penalty-kick style, which he eventually does, incurring sweet release.Hardly a smartphone appears in the spot, let alone any AI,  and the whole vibe blissfully shrugs its shoulders at the “let a computer tell you what to do” low-key enslavement of so many of the other spots that aired Sunday night (and at the slop; it was shot on film).“Being so programmed puts us in handcuffs, and we wanted to push back on that,” Rachel Zaluzec, Volkswagen's chief marketing officer, told me in an interview Friday. The company didn't even set out to make a Super Bowl ad, she said; it simply wanted to react to all the automation out there before soon realizing that it had a newly relevant “Drivers Wanted” campaign capturing the essence of those refreshing pre-tech days.“We see this as a recruiting campaign for an invitation to participate,” she said. “All this tech has its place of course but we should be asking, ‘are we controlling it or is it controlling us?'” Even driving, she added, could be a human act compared to the shut-offery of our Uberized and Waymoified world. “There's nothing like putting your hands on the wheel and deciding where you want to go,” she said.One of the slop-makers was trying to temper their message, too. Beverage company Sazerac, which during the game had the first-ever national Super Bowl ad generated by AI, said that its revival of the Fembot and Brobot characters to sell Svedka vodka was meant to show the folly of turning over so much power to the algorithm. “The entire idea of the campaign is that the robots have returned to remind the humans to be more human,” Sazerac chief marketing officer Sara Saunders told THR before the game.The best AI ad didn't mention the technology at all: Ben Affleck/90's sitcom Good Will Dunkin' spoof used de-aging to some nifty effect, even if it dipped into the uncanny valley a few times. Of course this was AI as tool for human vision, not as replacement for human creativity, skill and decision-making.

	It has become fashionable to rag on AI, and for some brands and public pronouncers this is, as you might warily suspect, a pose — a cheap monetization of hipster skepticism more than a carefully thought-out ideology. But a kernel of meaning sits at the heart of even the most blithe pushbacks — that we should ask what all this technology that has come to automate and convenientize our lives will take away with it.AI is coming and technology can't be stopped; about that Bob Iger, who recently made the point to David Muir, is right. But that doesn't tell the whole story. Sure, as a broad concept the idea of AI is moving forward; there are too many stakeholders for it not to. And too many unassailably positive use cases for it not to. If you as a medical researcher could know a drug's effects on the genome better, why wouldn't you? If you're a climate activist and can push for models that will limit waste, why wouldn't you do that too? But AI as a consumer deployment is far from assured; AI as something we'll use to replace or at least seriously augment teachers and writers and designers and therapists is not necessarily an inevitability. We have no idea if people will want to use Sora en masse to animate characters on Disney+, as Iger is betting it will, or will be deemed safe enough to become all of our assistants, or trustworthy enough to give advice on our how to talk to our mothers.


	Most important of all — and this was decidedly hidden by the brands on NBC Sunday night — we can do something about the onslaught. If we reject slop, AI video-generation tools get marginalized; if we evince skepticism about using a chatbot for mental health, Claude and ChatGPT see their reach curbed.It's telling that even as Google was making the case for how Gemini can think a house into existence and dispel the worry of its new inhabitants it used a very real Randy Newman singing “Feels Like Home” to make the point, and not, say, an AI trained on “the greatest living songwriters.” A more ironic undercutting of a tech company's message you will not find: “Machines can address all of our emotional needs, and to convince you of that we'll draw on the most human of artists.” But Big Tech leaders don't really do irony, and they're not worried about undercutting. Just keep pushing products that will make life more efficient, they believe, and hope that, faced with a world made so exhausting and overwhelming (by tech), consumers will grasp at any product that brings them momentary relief — the executives unaware, it seems, that we can simply be recruited not to participate.

	Bad Bunny made history with a unique and unforgettable performance at the Super Bowl 2026 Halftime Show. The show featured high-profile guests like Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin, a celebration of Puerto Rican culture, and special appearances by major stars such as Karol G, Cardi B and Pedro Pascal. It was full of iconic moments: a live wedding, the gifting of a Grammy, and a powerful inspirational message.


	Jessica Roiz: We've arrived at the Benito Bowl, I mean, the Super Bowl, from Levi's Stadium here in Santa Clara, California. And this is our halftime show recap show presented by Lexus. Never before had there been a halftime show like Bad Bunny's. Dressed in white, Benito brought the little house of Puerto Rico to California and started with his big hit, “Titi Me Preguntó.” Puerto Rican culture was well represented: Coco Fríos, dominoes, boxers, even a child asleep in a chair. He danced in a little house full of stars: Karol G, Cardi B, Pedro Pascal, and made time to send a direct message to the camera:


	Bad Bunny: It's because I never, I never stopped believing in myself! You should too. You should also believe in yourself. You're worth more than you think. Believe me.


	Jessica Roiz: The first surprise guest? Lady Gaga, performing a salsa version of her hit “Die With a Smile.” Another surprise? Ricky Martin, who sang “Lo Que Le Pasó a Hawaii.” A couple got married, Bad Bunny climbed a light post, and as a symbolic gesture, he gave a Grammy to what might be his inner child. The fans' passion was palpable in the stadium and even backstage. A few days before, during the press conference, journalists showed their love and support. Bad Bunny reminded everyone, “I know I told everyone they had four months to learn Spanish, but it's better if you learn to dance.” Benito ended the halftime show with a powerful message of unity: “God bless America!” He also reminded us all to take more photos. What a historic moment in Latin music! I'm Jessica Roiz, and this was our recap of the Benito Bowl. As always, stay connected to Billboard. Bye!

Pedro Pascal & Young Miko were also among the A-listers vibing out on the field.

	Hannah Dailey



Bad Bunny‘s highly anticipated Super Bowl halftime show is in the books, with the Puerto Rican superstar bringing light, love, music and dance to the country at a time when it's needed more than ever — and he didn't do it alone.


	As previously speculated, Benito brought out some guests during his Sunday (Feb. 8) performance at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, sharing the field with Lady Gaga — who treated fans to a surprise salsa rendition of her Billboard Hot 100-topping hit “Die With a Smile,” sans duet partner Bruno Mars — and Ricky Martin, who had his own solo moment singing “Lo Que Le Pasó a Hawaii.” But what no one could have predicted was the crop of A-listers who joined Bad Bunny for the show simply to vibe and hang out in the back, from Cardi B to Pedro Pascal, Karol G, Jessica Alba and Young Miko, each of whom stood out amid a joyous crowd of partiers on the singer/rapper's elaborate Puerto Rico-inspired set and danced along to the music.


	The array of celebrities showing a united front with Benito's other backup performers further drove home the point of his showcase: that “together, we are America,” a message he held up on a football shortly before making his exit. Despite many conservatives taking issue with the choice of a predominantly Spanish-speaking performer for the 2026 halftime program — something that culminated in Turning Point USA hosting an alternate mid-game show — the hitmaker made it clear that his only agenda is to cultivate community, a message his guest stars endorsed just by being there.

The superstar's 13-minute performance celebrated Puerto Rican culture on a global stage.


													By
												

	Isabela Raygoza


Associate Editor, Billboard Español


	After a momentous Grammys night on Feb. 1 — where he became the first artist to win album of the year with an all-Spanish-language LP, Debí Tirar Más Fotos — Bad Bunny ignited the Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. on Sunday (Feb. 8) with a headlining Super Bowl Halftime Show destined to go down in history.


	As the Seattle Seahawks soared to a 9-0 lead over the New England Patriots by halftime, anticipation was high for El Conejo Malo to take over. He kicked off his electrifying set with “Tití Me Preguntó” while donning an off-white football jersey emblazoned with his last name, Ocasio, and the number '64. Striding across the field, he passed workers in traditional pava (straw) hats, setting the tone for a celebration steeped in Puerto Rican culture.

	











	As he belted out the anthem, Bad Bunny made his way through scenes bursting with cultural pride — field workers, people playing dominoes, women getting their nails done, snow-cone makers preparing piraguas, and even boxers training under a spotlight. Meanwhile, cameos from stars like Karol G, Jessica Alba, and Cardi B added extra star power to the spectacle. In a moment Billboard predicted, he brought out his famous casita — a vibrant replica of a traditional Puerto Rican home — bringing it all full circle.




	Then he segued into “Yo Perreo Sola” and “Voy a Llevarte Pa' PR” as he climbed onto the roof of a pickup truck — with “perreo” emblazoned on the plates — surrounded by dozens of girls dancing in sync. With brief samples of Tego Calderón's “Pa Que Te Lo Gozen,” Don Omar's “Dale Don Dale” and Daddy Yankee's “Gasolina,” the hard-hitting, Grammy-winning hit “EoO” pulsed through the stadium. “This is the music of Puerto Rico,” he shouted in Spanish, and a full-blown reggaetón party erupted.


	The iconic toad, Coquí — a signature of his tour — made an appearance, delighting fans. Suddenly, violinists emerged, adding a dramatic flair to the moment introducing “Monaco.”


	“Buenas tardes, California, mi nombre es Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio,” he declared, voice brimming with emotion, “y si ahora estoy en el Super Bowl LX, es porque nunca, nunca dejé de creer en mí.” Then, looking straight into the camera, he delivered a heartfelt message: “Tú también nunca dejes de creer en ti.“


	Then, with an unexpected twist, Lady Gaga made a glorious entrance, dressed in a baby blue dress, singing “Die With A Smile” over a vibrant salsa rhythm. The performance transformed into a full-blown tropical reverie, with brass blaring and an infectious energy radiating through the stadium. Adding to the magic, the beloved Toñita — owner of Brooklyn's Caribbean Social Club, famously shouted out in “NuevaYol” — appeared on stage to hand Bad Bunny a drink. Appropriately, the opening notes of the latter Hot 100 hit began.


	The camera focused on the cuatro player as they began strumming the opening notes of “Lo Que Pasó en Hawaii.” Suddenly, superstar Ricky Martin emerged to deliver the song. As the melody transitioned, the rhythm of “El Apagón” took over. The moment shone a spotlight on the island's ongoing electricity issues in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, critiqued the privatization of its power grid under LUMA Energy and highlighted the displacement of its residents.

	











	Toward the end of the song, Bad Bunny took a moment to shout out every country from the Americas, one by one, as the crowd roared in support. Holding up a football emblazoned with the words “Together We Are America,” he delivered a poignant response to criticism he has faced, reinforcing his message of unity and empowerment.


	Despite the artist's attempts to steer clear of politics, this year's halftime performance has sparked significant discourse, becoming one of the most talked-about and debated shows in recent memory.


	When asked about his intentions for the show, Bad Bunny humbly reflected on the power of his music in a Friday (Feb. 6) interview with Access Hollywood's Scott Evans: “I'm just a normal guy that makes music. I want people to feel happiness and joy. I want to make people dance. I want to make them feel proud and think that everything is possible.”


	If the night proved anything, it's that Bad Bunny is redefining what's possible on the world's biggest stages.

The conservative organization offered counterprogramming against Bad Bunny's Super Bowl Halftime Show.


													By
												

	Melinda Newman



	The Turning Point USA All-American Halftime Show promised to celebrate “faith, family and freedom” via performances by Kid Rock, Brantley Gilbert, Lee Brice and Gabby Barrett.  


	The TPUSA website didn't feature information about the show until fairly far down on its homepage. Instead, it's soliciting donations through promoting the late founder Charlie Kirk's last book, Stop, in the Name of God, and his vision, which includes recruiting high school and college students to raise the next generation to support his movement “rooted in faith, freedom and love of country.”

	











	The TPUSA quartet is counterprogramming to the Super Bowl LX halftime, featuring another famous American, Bad Bunny. Kid Rock, promoting the show on Fox (which, interestingly, is not streaming the TPUSA halftime show) on Friday (Feb. 6) promised a “classic rock, in your face” opener, but then pledged to perform “one of the best written songs in a long time.” He didn't give away the title, but elaborated that it's a “pretty current, last few years country song. It's one of the greatest written songs I've heard in a long time.”


	Not one to miss an opportunity and being the good capitalist he is, Kid Rock will then release that song at midnight. (He does not mention whether he's donating the proceeds to TPUSA). His hints eliminate the song being “Cool Daddy Cool,” his 2001 collaboration with Joe-C that has resurfaced for its the notable lyrics about “hoes” and the couplet, “Young ladies, young ladies, I like 'em underage/ Some say that's statutory (But I say it's mandatory)” — lyrics that are much more in line with the Epstein files than supposed family values.

	











	Rock declared the TPUSA halftime is for people “who love America, love football, love Jesus.” He also stressed that neither he nor any of the other performers are “approaching this with any hate in our hearts.” (A sentiment that Gilbert also stressed in a social media post he made on Friday, though President Trump went out of his way to add that he felt both Bad Bunny and Green Day, who played a rousing opening slot, were not his cup of tea. “I'm anti-them. I think it's a terrible choice,” Trump told Page Six. “All it does is sow hatred. Terrible.”


	Rock also said that if the NFL wanted to take care of its fanbase, it would have picked local performers from the Bay Area such as Metallica (he's not alone in that thought), given the game is taking place in Santa Clara, Calif. (But Green Day — who is from the Bay Area — did perform during the pre-show opening ceremony.)


	Below, Billboard recaps TPUSA's halftime show in real time. 


4:49 p.m. PT: The seven-minute countdown to the halftime starts with a salute to Charlie Kirk, which is also a promo for conservative Christian Hillsdale College in Michigan, before returning to a countdown and a scroll to text for TPUSA merch and to text “freedom” to the same number to get “involved in the movement.”


4:53 p.m. PT: A commercial plugging adoption as an option, a key conservative pro-life message, is abruptly cut off for a commercial for tickets to the Olympics in Los Angeles and AI transcription service Otter. That seems like a missed opportunity to spread that message.


4:55 p.m. PT: With less than a minute left, Dept. of Defense head Pete Hegseth comes on to say “God bless our warriors and God bless our republic,” before tossing a football toward the camera.

	











5:04 p.m. Nearly 10 minutes after the countdown clock ended, more than 1.9 million people are waiting on TPUSA's YouTube channel. (The halftime was also supposed to air on TPUSA's X channel, but due to licensing restrictions, it could not stream there, the organization announced earlier in the day.) The live chat is very active, with people posting American flags memes and hailing where they're watching from. Maybe they are officially waiting until the first half ends to start.The actual Super Bowl performance is around 12-13 minutes because it takes about six minutes to load on and six minute to load off, but, obviously, TPUSA's halftime show has no such concerns.


5:11: p.m. PT What seems to be Brantley Gilbert's backing band comes out and his lead guitarist is shredding on an instrumental version of  “The Star Spangled Banner.” 


5:12 p.m. PT: Gilbert comes out and welcomes the audience and says, “This is real America” before launching into “Real American,” singing into a microphone that has brass knuckles on the top. He's playing before a small but ardent live audience in an undisclosed location. The song praises everything “USA,” as pyro goes off behind him.


5:15: p.m. PT Gilbert introduces “Dirt Road Anthem,” the song he cowrote with Colt Ford that became a monster hit for Jason Aldean in 2011. Gilbert starts singing, accompanied only by an acoustic guitar before going into the song's rap … one of the first songs that incorporated rap and country. It's a slowed down, lovely version that has the crowd swaying its arms.


5:20 p.m. PT:  Gilbert quickly ends and it switches to Gabby Barrett singing her massive hit, 2020's “I Hope.” It looks like the same set and there is an audience, but there was no visible switchover, so my hunch is it's not live and each act taped separately or TPUSA didn't want to waste time by showing the handoff.

	











5:23 p.m. PT: Barrett switches to “The Good Ones,” her follow-up about a good guy, as opposed to the louse in “I Hope.” The American Idol alum sounds great.


5:27 p.m. PT: Lee Brice suddenly appears on stage and breaks into his 2014 hit, “Drinking Class,” and the crowd cheers when he sings “When you knock us down we'll get up again and again.”


5:29 p.m. PT In the first comments to the audience so far and the only performer to mention Charlie Kirk, Brice says, “Charlie gave people microphones so they could say what's on their minds. This is what's on mind,” before launching into “Country Nowadays,” a song that will be on his next album about how hard it is to be “country in this country these days.” He talks about just wanting to shoot deer and mow his lawn, but he also doesn't think it's OK for a little boy to dress like a little girl (which gets a rousing cheer) and he resents that “I'm some right wing devil … because I was Jesus raised … because I have my morals and a small-town point of view.” It's the night's only outwardly political song.


5:33 p.m. PT:  Now Brice is out of political territory and back to the more familiar “Hard to Love” from 2012's album, Hard 2 Love. Like all the performers, he sounds good and the production minimal, but gets the job done. He leaves his tribute to Charlie Kirk, “When the Kingdom Comes,” left undone, perhaps because he didn't want to do a sad ballad.


5:34 p.m. PT: Kid Rock is introduced and the light show is amped up 1000% as he comes out in denim shorts, a fur jacket that he quickly sheds and a fedora before going hard into “Bawitdaba,” his breakthrough 1998 song. Unlike the other artists who seemed to be singing live, he appears to be lip-synching and focused more on dancing than singing, but it's high energy and infectious.

	











5:37 p.m. PT: In a 180-degree shift, the song ends and a cellist and violinist appear at the edge of the stage in front of a black backdrop, and Kid Rock is reintroduced by his real name, Robert Richie. It becomes very clear this is the recent country song he said he was going to remake — and he's right — it is one of the best country songs to come out in recent years: It's Cody Johnson's poignant “Til You Can't,” which Kid Rock covered in November and which won single of the year at the 2022 CMA Awards. Kid Rock is playing acoustic guitar in front of his drummer whose drum head has the Preamble to the Constitution on it. It's a sweet, emotional version.


5:42 p.m. PT: Kid Rock says he woke up recently and felt the song needed a new verse, which he debuts. “There's a book that is sitting in your house somewhere that could use some dusting off/ There's a man that died for all our sins  hanging on the cross,” he speaks before giving a shout-out to Jesus. (We thought it might be Charlie Kirk for a minute.) “In remembrance of Charlie Kirk” and photos of Kirk with wife Erika splash on the sides of the venue.


5:44 p.m. PT: A taped video with photos of Kirk and his family plays as KIrk speaks about getting involved and TPUSA's mission.


5:45 p.m. PT: And with that, it's over. It was a respectful, enjoyable presentation that, as Kid Rock had promised, appealed to the conservative base, but there's no flame-throwing rhetoric, few speeches, no mention of Trump. It's largely just music. Brice's song was as pointedly political as it got. For the MAGA crowd (and likely Trump), it undoubtedly didn't go far right enough (other than Brice's song). For the far left, there weren't really any moments to ridicule except for generally not liking the talent involved. It was a solid 15-minute presentation. They played it safe, and sometimes, that's OK.

International TV Co-Editor


HBO Max‘s Harry Potter TV series will be “the biggest streaming event in the history of HBO Max and arguably in streaming, period,” Warner Bros. Discovery‘s streaming chief said today in London.


	J.B. Perrette, CEO and President of Global Streaming and Games at WBD, waxed lyrically about the series, which will star Dominic McLaughlin as child wizard Harry Potter at an event announcing the launch date of HBO Max in the UK and Ireland.


	“[Harry Potter] producer David Heyman will tell you the scope of the production, the detail, the meticulousness of what they are going through and what they are building,” said Perrette. “It takes theatrical to a whole different level.

	“In the series you can go deeper, and tell more of the pieces that you didn't capture in a two-hour movie. Casey [Bloys, Chairman and CEO of HBO and HBO Max Content] doesn't like me saying this, but I really think this is the streaming event of the decade.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Anticipation over the series, which will retell JK Rowling's ‘Harry Potter novel series' as a multi-season television drama, has been significant ever since it was announced back in April 2023.


	HBO Max is set to launch in the UK and Ireland on March 26, completing the streaming service's rollout in Europe. The Harry Potter series – which comes from Warner Bros. Television, HBO Entertainment, Brontë Film & TV and Heyday Films – is set to launch next year and will undoubtably be among the most significant series debuts on 2027 around the world.

	











	“The team have been waiting for so long to deliver this in a market as big as important as the UK, said Perrett adding it would be “the biggest streaming event in the history of HBO Max and arguably in streaming, period. It's number one, two and three in many ways.”


	Child actor McLaughlin will star in the show alongside Alastair Stout, who will play Ron Weasley and Arabella Stanton, who will be Hermione Granger. The likes of John Lithgow, Janet McTeer, Paada Essiedu and Nick Frost will also have significant roles.


	The original film series made stars of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, and grossed billions of dollars at the box office for Warners.

I don't think the largest streaming platform should be allowed to acquire a competitor that's going to have the streaming event of the decade. Netflix buying Warner Brothers is a monopoly plain simple and it should be denied in a just court system. It should not be allowed to go through.

Seems like they're trying to maxhype a show that probably less people want than they initially thought.

I've personally definitely wanted HP as a show, one to two seasons per book – but the rumors around it have certainly been a negative. Now you might be right, they may be trying to hype train a potential wreck that even people like me have started getting skeptical about.

					By Greg Evans 

NY & Broadway Editor


EXCLUSIVE: A stage musical adaptation of best-selling novel and hit film Practical Magic is being developed by author Alice Hoffman, Grammy winners Norah Jone and Gregg Wattenberg, and Merrily We Roll Along director Maria Friedman.


	Peter Duchan, who wrote the book for the 2013 musical Dogfight, is writing the book for Practical Magic with Hoffman.


	“I'm so excited to be working with my amazing collaborators on bringing Practical Magic to the stage,” said Hoffman, whose 1995 novel was followed up with three other “Owens family saga” books: The Rules of Magic (2017), Magic Lessons (2020), and The Book of Magic (2021). “This story of love and sisterhood is meant for the theater. Music is the heart and soul of Practical Magic, you can hear it as you read the book, even though it isn't there. Now you will finally hear the story as I always imagined it. You will hear magic.”

	











	The original novel was adapted for a Warner Bros 1998 film directed by Griffin Dunne and starring Sandra Bullock, Nicole Kidman, Dianne Wiest, Stockard Channing and Aidan Quinn. A film sequel reuniting Bullock and Kidman, directed by Susanne Bier, is set to premiere in cinemas on September 11.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Casting and a production timeline for the musical have not been announced. The musical is being produced by special arrangement with Warner Bros. Theatre Ventures. Mark Kaufman, Executive Vice President and Chief Content Officer of WBTV, will serve as creative consultant.


	The musical adaptation was announced today by producers Stephanie and Nicole Kramer and Brian and Dayna Lee. The project marks the first stage musical by Jones, who broke onto the world stage with her multiple Grammy-winning 2002 album Come Away With Me. She has since become a 10-time Grammy-winner, selling more than 52 million albums with songs streamed more than 10 billion times worldwide.

	











	The Practical Magic synopsis: For more than two centuries, the Owens women have been feared, blamed, and whispered about in their small Massachusetts town. Orphaned as children and raised by their eccentric aunts, sisters Sally and Gillian Owens grow up determined to escape the ancestral curse they inherited. Choosing opposite paths, the sisters try to outrun their past, until love, loss, and long-buried secrets pull them back together. Forced to confront their family legacy, Sally and Gillian must decide whether the past can be overcome – and how much they are willing to risk for love.


	Wattenberg, who will write the music and lyrics with Jones, has co-written and/or produced eight Billboard #1 songs and numerous multi-Platinum singles, including Five For Fighting's “Superman (It's Not Easy)” and “100 Years,” Daughtry's “It's Not Over,” O.A.R.'s “Shattered,” and Train's global smash “Hey, Soul Sister,” which won a Grammy Award and ASCAP Song of the Year. He also co-wrote and produced Phillip Phillips' hit “Gone, Gone, Gone,” featured in The Amazing Spider-Man 2. He is the founder and Co-CEO of New York's Artist House, the largest music studio complex on the East Coast.


Practical Magic will mark the stage endeavor involving Warner Bros. Theatre Ventures, whose upcoming projects include adaptations of Crazy Rich Asians and the soon-to-arrive Broadway bound The Lost Boys and Dog Day Afternoon.

					By Andreas Wiseman 

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: Emma Roberts (American Horror Story) is set to star in horror A Body In The Woods, from producer Dave Caplan, whose credits include Longlegs and The Monkey.


	The project marks the debut film from new U.S. sales firm Manifest Pictures, led by Yvette Zhuang and Zach Glueck, with pre-sales getting underway at this week's European Film Market in Berlin.


Scream 4 and American Horror Story actress Roberts will play Alice Lincoln, “a woman at the turn of the century living deep in the Marshall Woods, a place long-plagued by legends of a menacing witch. When Alice is left alone at her remote cabin to keep vigil over the body of an unidentified mine worker, unsettling disturbances in the dark lead Alice to fear the corpse may not be fully at rest. The appearance of a silent woman at the edge of the forest road traps Alice in a waking nightmare between the growing evil within and the nameless terror waiting beyond her door.”

	The “nightmarish folklore tale” is written and to be directed by Stephen Cognetti, creator of the Hell House franchise. Production is set to begin in September and Caplan of C2 Motion Picture Group will finance.




			Watch on Deadline		







	As we revealed last month, Manifest is the new sales firm from former Miramax and WME Independent execs Zhuang and Glueck. The company is backed by QC Entertainment and Gramercy Park Media.


	Said: Caplan: “Stephen has consistently proven he can create terrifying, elevated immersive horror experiences. With Emma in the lead, A Body in the Woods is an undeniable package.”

	











	“Emma brings an intelligence and emotional fearlessness that elevates everything she touches,” added writer-director Stephen Cognetti. “She understands horror on a cellular level—how to balance vulnerability, strength, and terror. My goal with A Body in the Woods is to deliver an elevated horror film that tests the limits of fear—not just for our lead character, but for the audience sitting in the dark with her. I want people to leave the theater unsettled, questioning what they saw, and feeling like they survived something.”


	Manifest commented: “We're honored to be working with a producer that has the pedigree of Dave Caplan and a director with a consistent track record of terrifying audiences around the world.”


	Roberts' credits also include Holidate, Scream Queens, and box office hit We're the Millers. She is a co-producer on Hulu series Tell Me Lies.


	Roberts is repped by Sweeney Entertainment; Cognetti is repped by Anonymous Content.

					By Max Goldbart 

International TV Co-Editor


EXCLUSIVE: For Zai Bennett, 2026 is “the year of delivery.” 


	The BBC Studios production chief, who has a new job title (more on that anon), has been in post for just over 12 months and while it's been something of a rocky ride, he certainly can't be accused of twiddling his thumbs. Now, with one final piece to his BBC Studios jigsaw soon falling into place, Bennett is trying to free up his key lieutenants to birth the next generation of hits, nurture the current ones and invest in a new wave of talent.


	“I look around my top table and I'm pretty happy,” the executive tells Deadline in his first interview since joining BBC Studios from Sky. “So now it's about delivery. This is the year of getting our nose to the grindstone, getting some commissions and converting those developments into orders.”

	BBC Studios is the commercial arm of the BBC, a production and distribution powerhouse that beams Strictly Come Dancing, Doctor Who, Bluey, Baby Reindeer and Blue Planet to the world. It holds a unique place in the British TV landscape, being able to operate and think with a “ruthlessly commercial” hat on, according to Bennett, and yet ultimately putting funds back into the public service BBC, its “one shareholder,” which has of course fallen on somehwat tricky inancial times in recent years.




			Watch on Deadline		







	When Bennett took over from his predecessor Ralph Lee, he felt there was a part of this story that BBC Studios was failing to tell. “We were not vocal and proud about the totality of what we do,” he explains. “We would be individually proud about certain shows but we didn't come together and say, ‘You are part of a collective studio that has creative experience you can learn and share from.' We're a huge distributor and the most awarded producer in the UK, but we're not always mentioned first.”


	Telling that holistic story is what Bennett, an affable executive who appears younger than his fifty-something years, is laser-focused on doing. After spending his first six months getting the lie of the land, he clicked into gear at the start of 2025, merging factual with entertainment under Kate Ward, bringing in former Channel 4 youth boss Karl Warner to focus on formats, reforming global productions under Matt Forde and revamping scripted, with the hire of Gangs of London EP Jamie Hall to run drama out of the UK and veteran executive Mark Linsey shifting to focus solely on L.A. He even hired an artificial intelligence supremo from Disney, Alice Taylor, who is probing interesting areas like drama reconstruction in documentaries and using AI functionality in formats.

	











Merging production and sales


	Bennett's final play for now, Deadline can reveal, is a merger of production and sales under what is now called BBC Studios Global Content. Bennett, a former BBC and Sky commissioner whose past credits include Chernobyl and Patrick Melrose, has a new title: CEO and Chief Creative Officer, BBC Studios Global Content. Once he finds a replacement for departing U.S.-based content sales chief Janet Brown, that role will relocate to London and the sales team will operate in lockstep with production, aiding Bennett with his ultimate goal.


	“It all just gives us a view of the end-to-end monetization of the business,” he adds. “So I can talk to Jamie [Hall] or Kate [Ward] and ask what we are concentrating on, what we are developing and how can we monetize and exploit things? The creative bones in this place are awesome. I want to make sure we have the same drive and energy in the commercialism.”


	Bennett wants to shout from the rooftops about the success of the labels that BBC Studios owns. He is even tinkering with individual labels' branding. Where outfits such as Baby Reindeer maker Clerkenwell Films, Steve Coogan's Baby Cow and Conclave indie House Productions don't have BBC Studios in their name, they have now added ‘part of BBC Studios' to their logos and end slates. 


	“When Clerkenwell won Emmys for Baby Reindeer, we were suddenly hot, and we needed to capitalize on that,” he adds. “We've got individual labels and creatives who are brilliant and my job is to make that feel more than the sum of its parts.”


	He leans on the example of Clerkenwell, which is making Netflix surfing drama Breakers and has “moved into the ‘really mainstream'” with Channel 4 thriller Deadpoint, according to Bennett, which will comprise a cornerstone of the BBC Studios Showcase catalog later this month. Bennett likens the thriller starring It's a Sin breakout Callum Scott Howells to Sylvester Stallone's 1993 movie Cliffhanger, if it was set in Wales.


	Where talent and Clerkenwell is concerned, however, things haven't all gone BBC Studios' way. Half Man, the highly-anticipated next project from Baby Reindeer creator Richard Gadd, a BBC-HBO series about estranged brothers starring Gadd and Jamie Bell, comes from Banijay label Mam Tor, with Banijay Rights distributing. “You have long and interesting creative relationships and people move around a bit,” says Bennett. “That's completely normal.”


	With UK scripted boss Hall getting his feet under the table, Bennett wants to be aggressive in the UK drama market. He reveals he is aiming to make three to four talent deals or minority investments in indies per yer in the UK and U.S. for at least the next two years, with one announcement imminent. “This isn't a ‘one and done', this is a drumbeat,” says Bennett. Recent deals of this ilk include tie-ups with Barbie star Jamie Demetriou, The Ballad of Wallis Island writer Tom Basden, Ted Lasso alum Nick Mohammed and Cunk on Earth creator Diane Morgan. Forde's global production team, meanwhile, is “definitely” looking to acquire majority stakes in indies outside of the UK, Bennett says.


	Former Pulse and Vice Studios boss Hall, who Bennett described as the “real deal” and someone who joined BBC Studios from a “very hard company to work for in recent times,” has been tasked with unearthing the “next wave of creatives.” “Is it buying companies that are a bit more established? Probably not. This is about going the next layer down, with writers, directors and producers, and telling them we can set them up in some form of IP partnership where they get to share in the success of their show and we'll bankroll some of that.”

	











	In a market where funding drama is becoming harder and harder, Bennett says BBC Studios can occupy an interesting place, embracing some “economic risk” when it comes to funding shows for broadcasters like the BBC – still by far and away BBC Studios' biggest customer occupying around half of its order book – and taking big risks mixed with surefire bets. 


	“We can give [BBC drama boss] Lindsay [Salt] a range of editorial choices and say to her that commerically we will solve problems,” says Bennett. “If we want to do, say, an action adventure show costing £5M ($6.8M) per hour, we will take a bigger risk than normal because we can see the opportunity of selling that around the world. The risky ones are often the shows that pop.”


	Big swings upcoming outside of the BBC drama stable include Netflix's versions of Pride and Prejudice (Lookout Point) and Bella Mackie's How to Kill Your Family (Sid Gentle), along with BritBox's Agatha Christie series Tommy & Tuppence (Lookout).


Funding the Time Lord


	No decision more neatly demonstrates the nasty headwinds facing scripted than Disney pulling out of the Doctor Who deal with the BBC, BBC Studios and Bad Wolf after just two seasons. For the show to continue long beyond its 2026 Christmas special, which is being penned by showrunner Russell T. Davies, the BBC now needs to replace some of that lost budget, which totals millions of pounds per hour. 


	Bennett avoids directly answering the question of whether BBC Studios will stump up some of the lost cash to give the show a long-term future – noting that he “won't speak for the BBC” – but says “we're all in it together” when it comes to keeping the Time Lord on the small screen for years to come.


	“We're a big important part of Doctor Who and are all motivated to make sure Doctor Who has a long and flourishing life,” he says. “We've got the Christmas special coming. After that, it's time for us all to work on it.”


	The BBC and BBC Studios may have lost their American co-production partner on Doctor Who but Bennett brims with confidence over BBC Studios' standing in the States, and he is still riding high over the success of the CBS version of Ghosts, which emerged from a deal with Lionsgate that elapsed two years ago.


	He reveals that BBC Studios has seven paid developments with U.S. networks and streamers, including an American version of BBC family comedy Here We Go with Universal Television and Amy Poehler's Paper Kite Productions, and a U.S. remake of Mike Bubbins' Mammoth about a 1970s PE teacher who comes back to life in 2024, which is in with Fox.


	Striking another Lionsgate-style exclusive partnership isn't a priority – Bennett wants BBC Studios to “own the economics” of American greenlights by remaining the lead studio on projects – but he is enthused by opportunities across the Atlantic.


	This extends to unscripted, where Dancing with the Stars, ABC's version of Strictly Come Dancing, has just come off the back of one of its best ever years, due in no small part to a revamped social media strategy that focused on leveraging TikTok.


	Bennett says the American unscripted team is now sharing these learnings with other territories in which Strictly is produced. “There's some amazing stuff about casting and TikTok and it was really about making lots of native content,” he says.


New era for ‘Strictly Come Dancing'


Strictly in the UK is entering a new era and is currently seeking not one but two hosts following the shock exits of Claudia Winkleman and Tess Daly. Could the BBC look to the world of TikTok – mirroring what Amazon is doing with The Grand Tour – for its next Strictly presenters? Bennett won't be drawn on speculation. “That news will come out of the BBC,” he says. “It's ultimately up to them.” 

	











	With shows like Bravo's Ladies of London and Prime Video's 1% Club doing the business in the States, Bennett is delighted with his L.A. formats team. 


	Next up on his unscripted docket is Secret Genius, a UK format developed by BBC Studios-owned Mothership that just launched to more than one million viewers on Channel 4 – no mean feat. That show, which sees Celebrity Traitors winner Alan Carr travel the country seeking the most extraordinary minds, will be a big talking point at the BBC Studios Showcase in London.


You can't “smush us together”


	Returning to industry chatter and no doubt set to dominate the gossip mill at the Showcase and concurrent London TV Screenings will be industry consolidation. Banijay and All3Media are reportedly merging, Sky wants to buy ITV and, across the pond, the biggest industry deal of the millennia, Netflix and Warners, rumbles on. 


	Bennett, for what it's worth, can't see BBC Studios getting caught up in a consolidation play anytime soon.


	“Our industry was disrupted by streaming and you can see how during disruption there is often consolidation,” ponders Bennett. “[Companies like] Banijay and All3Media are thinking whether they can crash together a load of back office and make things a bit cheaper. You could up the margin by 1% or 2% and at that scale that makes a difference. The important thing for us is we are at a scale, and it's an important scale. We want to grow ideally as much as humanly possible but we're not in a position where you can smush us together with another company with any level of ease.” 


	Instead, Bennett once again returns to BBC Studios' USP, “not being all things for everyone but selling a very specific thing, British storytelling, exported around the world. It's in the name.”


	BBC Studios delivered strong financial returns to the public service BBC last year. With the stakes high, Bennett is at the coalface of the work making sure these big numbers aren't a one off. In the face of what could be deemed a great deal of pressure, he remains sanguine. 


	“We want commercial returns, don't get me wrong, and we will be ruthlessly commercial about the business, but we will always take a longer term view,” he adds. “In this market, you have to.”

			By Dominic Patten, Natalie Oganesyan 


	Tan condenadamente bueno!


	On Saturday, Gov. Gavin Newsom declared Super Bowl Sunday to be Bad Bunny Day in California. Today, Bad Bunny himself took center field at the Super Bowl LX halftime show and made the day for everyone, Spanish-speaking and otherwise.


	Aside from all the MAGA foot stamping & NFL audience ambitions Bunny had to endure on the way to Sunday's big show, the recently minted Album of the Year winner faced a very high bar to meet or surpass last year's tour de force from Kendrick Lamar. Yet, rising to a challenge, and the moment, has often been one of the major flexes of Bunny a.k.a. Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio's success.

			Watch on Deadline		







	Coming to a conclusion with Bunny proclaiming “God bless America” in English and tossing a “Together, We Are America” engraved football, tonight's performance was a complex and compelling success.


	Joined by Lady Gaga (singing a salsa rendition of “Die with a Smile”) and Ricky Martin (covering the artist's “LO QUE LE PASÓ A HAWAii”) at different points, Bunny exclaimed to the crowd at home and in Levi's Stadium to “dance without fear, speak without fear” as a Puerto Rican flag waved behind him.

	Under the last vestiges of the California afternoon sun, a phalanx of dancers, fruit vendors, piragua sellers, boxers, power line repairmen (highlighting the constant outages on the island territory), that trademark Concho toad, a string section, a real-life wedding, flags of the hemisphere's nations and migrant workers clad in the emblematic pavas, the global superstar was blunt in his mantra of the day that “the only thing more powerful than hate is love.” His signature Casita (which he exuberantly crashed through the roof of at one prerecorded point) housed an awards show VIP table of celebs, including Pedro Pascal, Jessica Alba and collaborators Young Miko, Karol G and Cardi B.

	











	If the cheers from the more than 60,000 in the home of the San Francisco 49ers were any indication, there was a lot of love in the house – and not just the aforementioned casita, if you know what I mean? When Bunny handed his Best Album Grammy to a young boy who was reminiscent of Liam Conejo Ramos — the 5-year-old recently freed after being kidnapped and detained by ICE — the whole place picked up what he was really putting down and went wild. Which is why, in an America torn apart by gaping ideological, racial and wealth divides, the proud puertorriqueño Grammy winner nailed it today by transforming the cavernous concrete Santa Clara stadium into a sweat soaked San Juan nightclub for 13 hip-shaking minutes.

😂😂😂 @sanbenito #AppleMusicHalftime pic.twitter.com/bc603uJuF5


	Certainly, with NBC taking a breather for a few hours from its thorough Winter Olympics coverage, the vibe and groove laid down by Bad Bunny were welcome reliefs after the low-scoring and low-energy first half of the latest Super Bowl clash between the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots. 


	In many ways, the Super Bowl halftime show has a greater life span than the Super Bowl itself. 


	For one thing, on average, most NFL matches only see 11-minutes of actual play over a whole game, whereas the halftime show is a jam-packed 13-minutes usually. Few remember that the Indianapolis Colts beat the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI, but almost everyone knows that Prince delivered the Gold standard of halftime shows that night in 2007. Yet, while the cultural and political significance of Bad Bunny's performance cannot be denied, up until the actual halftime show this year, the potency and nuance of his music seemed to get short shrift.


	However, with the opening notes of the reggaeton and rhythm-infused hit “Tití Me Preguntó” today, Bunny effortlessly shifted and raised the energy, launching into what he promised would be a true blowout for the Super Bowl. His triumphant and ebullient block party-esque rave-up of Latinidad featured a medley of songs old and new, spanning albums Un Verano Sin Ti and history-making Debí Tirar Más Fotos.


	Clad in a structured white suit featuring his last name and the number 64 on his back, Bunny shimmied through his deep bench of bangers like “Yo Perreo Sola,” “Party,” “VOY A LLeVARTE PA PR,” “EoO,” “Monaco,” “BAILE INoLVIDABLE,” “NUEVAYoL,” “El Apagón” and a pulsating house remix of “CAFé CON RON” (as well as the few distinct rump-shaking notes of Daddy Yankee's “Gasolina”). Ever the showman, the King of Latin Trap stage-dived into the hands of his energetic dancers, before the scenery shifted from the Jíbaro fields to the Nuevayol locales of a local bodega and barbershop.


	His performance took place in front of attendees including Netflix's co-CEO Ted Sarandos, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Adam Sandler, Range Media chief Peter Micelli, tennis legend Roger Federer, Mark Wahlberg, Gov. Newsom, Jon Bon Jovi (who intro'd the Patriots), Chris Pratt (who intro'd the Seahawks), Justin Bieber and Hailey Bieber, Travis Scott, Hall of Fame NFL icons, avowed Bunny fan Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, Kendall Jenner, Apple Music's Zane Lowe, Rob Lowe, J Balvin and no Donald Trump.


	Even with protests outside and a brief message transmitted via the jumbotron, there was no explicit “ICE out” from Bunny like at last week's Grammys. It may disappoint some supporters, but he didn't need to go there and let an already-rabid MAGA froth all over the night. Instead, as a lame ass Kid Rock-led “All-American” alternative halftime played out far away on far-right media, the rap-pop superstar put on a celebration of excellence and love of Latino USA. A self-styled “Benito Bowl” celebration that resulted in deftly spotlighting some of the best of 21st century America — with an unsentimental look at some of the worst.


RELATED: Super Bowl LX Kicks Off With Knockout Performances From Green Day, Coco Jones, Brandi Carlile & Charlie Puth












	Casting all the virtue and vice signaling on the political spectrum aside with his straightforward embrace of America,  Bunny then gave viewers a geography lesson by listing the countries that make up the Americas. Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Cuba, Republica Dominicana, Jamaica, Haiti, Antillas, United States, and Canada, all got name checked. Finally shouting out Puerto Rico in the hemisphere league of nations, Bunny lifted up that “Together, we are America” football and launched into his “DtMF” tune — a nostalgia-tinged crowd- pleaser that begs to be chanted from the pricey seats to the cheap(er) seats.

	Surrounded by palm trees, bamboo and foliage on the field where the 9-0 Seahawks-leading game had been minutes before, the global musician's decision to center resilience, culture and delight proved to be the biggest and most poignant middle finger to the cruel abductions, deportations and killings by federal immigration agents.

	For all the huffing, puffing and controversary in MAGA circles over Bunny being picked by the NFL and Jay-Z to be the inaugural Spanish-speaking solo halftime show headliner, the Happy Gilmore 2 actor's stint on stage tonight was a bit of a rerun. Six years ago, Bad Bunny made a guest appearance at Super Bowl LIV with Jennifer Lopez and Shakira (who wished him good luck tonight on social media) for a verse from “I Like It” and “Chantaje.”


	Today — with the rest of the world looping American music back to us in its own colors and themes the way the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin harnessed the Stateside Blues back in the 1960s from the UK to the USA — unleashed his rise to marquee act. Watching tonight's halftime show, which is often hailed for the exposure it brings to its stars, it should come as no surprise that Bunny has been one of the most successful and streamed artists on the planet the past five years.


	Honed by his 30+ show No Me Quiero Ir de Aqui (I Don't Want to Leave Here) residency back home in Puerto Rico last year, Bunny leaned a bit on the tried-and-true, and, like Lamar last year, pivoted into the now. In that vein, both popular and subversive in the tradition of Louis Armstrong, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Edith Piaf, Fela Kuti and the “Not Like Us” rapper, Bunny has been playing the long game since the beginning — which is what brought him to the big game today.


	Earlier this week in a sit-down with halftime show sponsors Apple Music and even earlier via his teaser trailer, the “Otro Atardecer” crooner told fans and foes alike what to expect tonight. “It's better if they learn to dance,” he said, cutting to the chase. After the Spanish-language spectacle that went down Sunday, if friend and foe weren't dancing they really missed the point of the biggest picture of all in America 2026.


	Like the man said, “God bless America.”

Bad Bunny's performance show was electrifying and alluring. The only qualm that I had was that he failed to mentioned the Virgin Islands, Guam, Samoa and the Marianna islands as Americas. It was extraordinary to view a person of color captivated not only the Americas stages but the entire world stage as well. He was bloody fantastico!!!!

Give me the USC marching band any day.

The future is here.

The future is Bunny.

Vive\a Americas!

My Spanish is poor. So I didn't understand a word, but the dancing was great. Trump is an embarrassing idiot. The show was. Great! Thank you NFL. for putting it on.

Chris Brown is not a fan of Big Bunny's Super Bowl LX halftime performance. 

“I think it's safe to say… they need me,” Brown wrote on his Instagram Stories, followed by a winking face emoji.

The post came minutes after Bad Bunny gave an electric performance during the prestigious halftime show, which celebrated his native Puerto Rico.

The rapper, who performed entirely in Spanish, thrilled the crowd with songs like “Monaco,” “Yo Perreo Sola,” and “Tití Me Preguntó,” while celebrities including Cardi B, Pedro Pascal, Alix Earle, Jessica Alba and Karol G danced around him.

The performance honored many aspects of Puerto Rican culture, like the food, games and dancing.

Lady Gaga delivered a surprise rendition of her and Bruno Mars' ballad, “Die With a Smile,” and Puerto Rican-born Ricky Martin sang “Lo Que Pasó a Hawaii.”

Fellow Puerto Rican Ricky Martin also surprised the crowd, as he sang “Lo Que Pasó a Hawaii.”

The Grammy winner's appearance at the Super Bowl outraged some NFL fans who took offense to a Spanish-language performer.

He has also been critical of the Trump administration and the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Brown has never performed at a Super Bowl halftime show.

In 2009, the “Kiss Kiss” singer notoriously pleaded guilty to felony assault of his then-girlfriend, Rihanna.

He was sentenced to five years' probation and six months of community service.

The singer has been in trouble with the law since then.

In 2017, Brown's ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran was granted a five-year restraining order against him.

Brown allegedly became aggressive toward the “Claws” alum for not returning money and gifts he had given her during their relationship.

Last year, the “No Guidance” singer was arrested in Manchester, England, for allegedly hitting music producer Abe Diaw with a tequila bottle at a London nightclub in 2023.

In October 2023, Diaw filed a lawsuit against Brown, claiming the singer had assaulted him eight months prior.

The producer alleged Brown “inflicted severe and lasting injuries” on him after “beating him over the head” with a bottle of Don Julio 1942 in February 2023 at the Tape London nightclub.

Travis Kelce's ex-girlfriend, Kayla Nicole, shaded the NFL player and his fiancée, Taylor Swift, in a 2026 Super Bowl commercial Sunday.

In an ad for the sports app Sleeper, Tiffany Haddish and Ben Simmons played the role of two emotional injury specialists called “The Ex-communicators.”

“Have you or someone you know been injured emotionally in a high-profile relationship?”Haddish asked, before Simmons inquired, “Are your exes snubbing you in commercials?”

Notably, Simmons' ex-girlfriend, Kendall Jenner, just poked fun at him in a Fanatics Sportsbook commercial last week.

“If so, you may be entitled to retribution,” Haddish said, before Simmons corrected her, saying, “Compensation.”

“That's what I said!” Haddish exclaimed before Simmon introduced their alleged clients.

“Don't get me started on these two,” Nicole, wearing a pink suit, said with sass, adding of Haddish and Simmons, “They have no idea what they're doing at all.”

In the caption, she is described as the “ex of a certain NFL player.” 

Ace Greene from “Love Island” Season 7 agreed, telling viewers not to call them if they need help, before Offset admitted he doesn't “know what [he's] doing here.”

“I'm great at relationships,” added the Migos rapper, whose ex-wife Cardi B is currently dating Stefon Diggs. (Diggs is playing for the New England Patriots against the Seattle Seahawks in the championship game.)

“Simmons & Haddish promised me that they could put an end to this whole ex-girlfriend fiasco quickly,” Nicole said.

The ad then jumped to Simmons, who claimed, “That doesn't sound right.”

Nicole then tried, “rapidly,” with Simmons saying, “That's not what I said.”

“Okay, pronto,” Nicole offered, before Simmons interjected, “I said swiftly!” — a clear reference to the pop star.

The video ends with Haddish saying that picking the right love interest “is hard.”

“Picking the right athletes doesn't have to be,” the comedian said, with Simmons adding, “Pick players. Choose more. Choose less. Make cash.”

“Download Sleeper in the app store today,” Haddish concluded.

Nicole, 34, dated Kelce, 36, on and off from 2017 to 2022 and has since talked openly about her former relationship with the Kansas City Chiefs tight end.

Swift, for her part, snubbed Nicole in her 2025 song, “Opalite.” 

The “Fortnight” singer and Kelce started dating in 2023 and got engaged two years later. They are expected to tie the knot this summer.

Love was in the air during Bad Bunny's epic Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show.

The bride and groom featured in the performance reportedly got married — for real — on the field at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif, Page Six can confirm. 

The couple even invited the singer to their wedding.

A NBC News reporter was the first to report the news, writing on X, “This is incredibly cool — A source familiar with Bad Bunny's performance tonight tells me that the couple in the halftime show got married for real.

“They invited Bad Bunny to their wedding and in turn he invited them to get married during his performance.”

The singer's rep also confirmed the news to Variety. 

Fans on X gushed over how “freaking cool” and “awesome” that detail was.

The bride and groom were seen throughout the show, at one point dancing and at another point there was an officiant.

The bride wore a design by embattled designer Hayley Paige featuring a strapless sweetheart neckline and all-over lace.

“Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine one of my wedding dresses making a cameo at the Super Bowl. Seeing [the dress] during Bad Bunny's halftime show is, well, loco. But what makes it truly special is that it's worn by a real bride on her wedding day,” the designer told Page Six in a statement.

The musician, 31, also celebrated his native Puerto Rico during the lively and celeb-packed performance. 

Different aspects of his culture were highlighted throughout the show such as the dancing and the food.

Lady Gaga delivered a surprise rendition of her and Bruno Mars' “Die with a Smile” while second musical guest, Ricky Martin, sang “Lo Que Pasó a Hawaii.”

Other stars seen dancing to his hit tunes on the field included Cardi B, Jessica Alba, Alix Earle, Karol G and Pedro Pascal.

Bad Bunny also incorporated his historic Grammys win from last week's awards show into the performance, as his album “Un Verano Sin Ti” is the first Spanish-speaking album to be nominated for best album of the year.

Bad Bunny, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, exclaimed, “God bless America,” and held up a football that read, “Together, we are America” in a powerful conclusion.

On Thursday, the rapper teased there would be a “huge party” during his 2026 Super Bowl performance while speaking at the Apple Music Halftime Show press conference — though no one could have guessed he would be celebrating a couple's union.

“I just want to have fun, it's going to be a huge party … I don't want to give spoilers, people only need to worry about dancing,” he said.

“They don't even have to learn Spanish; it's better if they dance, but there's no better dance that comes from the heart. … Of course, choose your team at the game.”

Kim Kardashian and Lewis Hamilton hard launched their relationship at Super Bowl LX.

The new couple was spotted enjoying the big game at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. on Sunday.

Photos of the pair went viral on X after they appeared on the screen of an international broadcast of the game between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks.

In a video, Kardashian, 45, could be seen smiling while talking to Hamilton, 41.

The Skims founder wore a black coat and large diamond choker necklace. She also switched up her hair by rocking bangs.

Kardashian's hairstylist, Chris Appleton, shared a photo of her full look on Instagram before the game, writing, “Super Bowl bangs.”

Kardashian and Hamilton have been friends for years, but recently took their relationship to the next level by enjoying a romantic European excursion.

The duo stayed at the luxury UK hotel Estelle Manor in the Cotswolds last weekend, where they enjoyed a couples massage and had a private, upscale dinner.

The stars then traveled to London where they stayed at the luxurious Rosewood Hotel.

They ended their trip with a stop in Paris.

“Kim and Lewis have such intense working schedules, so they're keen to spend as much time together as possible,” a source told the US Sun about the couple.

“Right now, they're inseparable and are fitting their dates around Kim's work commitments,” the insider added.

Before their European vacation, the pair both attended Kate Hudson's New Year's Eve party in Colorado, but they weren't photographed together.

Kardashian and Hamilton both have a star-studded list of exes.

The reality star was linked to Odell Beckham Jr. and dated Pete Davidson following her divorce from her third husband, Kanye West, with whom she shares four children.

Hamilton, for his part, has been linked to Nicki Minaj, Rihanna, Gigi Hadid and even Kardashian's sister Kendall Jenner.

Kardashian most recently opened up about her dating life on her sister Khloe Kardashian's “Khloé In Wonder Land” podcast last month, sharing the qualities she wants in her next partner.

“Good morals and values, a calm person, dependable,” the “All's Fair” actress said. “Takes accountability. I think that's my number one thing.”

Kardashian also claimed she hasn't been secretly dating anyone in the past year.

“I just feel like my kids need me. It's really hard when I have to put them to bed every night. I get them up. I take them to school,” she explained “I get them ready. They sleep in my bed. I haven't had time — and I'm okay with that. 

“I thought, ‘You know what? I'm going to be studying. I won't have time. When I'm done, I'll open myself up.'”

More than 20 years after fellow video game adaptation auteur Uwe Boll last adapted House Of The Dead, Paul W.S. Anderson is taking a crack at the property. Initially announced in 2024, Anderson's version of Sega's classic first-person zombie shoot-'em-up is still showing signs of life, casting Isabela Merced, who is well-versed in adaptations of popular zombie games. Merced recently starred in Superman and, more relevantly, The Last Of Us, HBO's Emmy-nominated zombie TV show that seems to be bringing the genre back from the dead. 

Unlike Boll, who directed an adaptation of Sega's hit video game in 2003, Anderson, as his wont, finds himself drawn to the games' elaborate mythology, which could serve as the basis for an entire run of films, not unlike his billion-dollar-grossing Resident Evil movies. To wit, Anderson envisions “this as the start of a tentpole franchise which can explore the rich world and lore that Sega has created over a whole series of films” with “Isabela at its heart.” According to Deadline, the series is a “top Sega priority,” along with facilitating Sonic the Hedgehog's crippling chilidog addiction. 

It is nice to see the old boys of schlocky 2000s video game adaptations crossing paths yet again. Back in 2003, less than a decade after Anderson revolutionized the genre with Mortal Kombat, the first game-to-screen movie people didn't completely hate, Boll dragged the genre back to the depths. It shouldn't be too much of a lift for Anderson to overcome Boll's legacy, especially considering how efficient a blockbuster director Anderson has become over the intervening years. But what we'd really like to see, even more than another version of House Of The Dead, is Uwe Boll getting back to what matters: Challenging people to boxing matches. Boll vs. Anderson would raise a lot of money for charity.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Whether or not you speak Spanish, there's no misunderstanding what Bad Bunny meant","https://www.avclub.com/bad-bunny-super-bowl-lx-halftime-show","Mon, 09 Feb 2026 03:49:43 GMT","

Being a fan of Bad Bunny who doesn't speak more than the most rudimentary Spanish means you miss a lot of the nuance of what he's saying. He knows this; in an appearance on the New York Times Popcast earlier this week, he said that even a lot of his fellow Latinos miss out on what he's saying because he often raps in Puerto Rican slang. When asked how he felt about that, he trilled, “I don't care!” Besides, even if you miss the lyrics, there's plenty to enjoy within the music, the arrangements, the visual storytelling, the stagecraft. In closing his Super Bowl LX halftime performance, Bad Bunny issued a statement impossible to misunderstand. 

In the final moment of his set on February 8, Bad Bunny, holding a football that read “Together, we are America,” said “God bless America” before listing the countries of South America, North America, and some of the Caribbean. He was flanked by flags of all of these countries as the Jumbotron behind him displayed the message, in English, “THE ONLY THING MORE POWERFUL THAN HATE IS LOVE.” By virtue of his birth in Puerto Rico, Bad Bunny is American, just like someone born in Canada, or Mexico, or Cuba, or Bolivia, or Chile is American. America is not the United States; America isn't even contained in one continent. 

This is not a new thought, but it is one that deserves to be repeated, especially as the MAGA wing of U.S. politics pushes for an increasingly narrow definition of who gets to claim to be an American. These are people who were upset that Bad Bunny was selected to be the halftime performer, and upset again by his plain refusal to sing in English for the event. Turning Point USA was angry enough to plan a rival halftime set that it streamed on YouTube. (It was also supposed to stream on right-wing slop trough X, but the organizers flubbed that one.) Absurdly dubbed “The All-American Halftime Show,” TP's starred Kid Rock, Brantley Gilbert, Lee Brice, and Gabby Barrett. Talk about a narrow definition of American. 

Of course, the crowd who would willingly tune into something like that is not the crowd that Bad Bunny is trying to woo. For as long as Bad Bunny has been famous in the United States, he has stubbornly refused to water down his identity as a Puerto Rican or to stop singing in Spanish. From the first big hit he was part of in the continental U.S., Cardi B's “I Like It,” he has always maintained that he performs in Spanish. But as we saw at halftime, he isn't against bringing in English when there's something he wants to be sure is understood by people too incurious to use Google Translate. In the music video for the ebullient “NUEVAYoL,” one scene features the voice of a Trump impersonator on the radio, saying, “I made a mistake. I want to apologize to the immigrants in America—I mean the United States. I know America is the whole continent.” 

These views shouldn't be alienating, nor should Bad Bunny's set. There were other parts of the performance, too, where he spelled out what he meant for the non-Spanish speakers. The sole English segment featured Lady Gaga singing a salsa-style rendition of “Die With A Smile” at, tellingly, a wedding. It wasn't just a (real!) union between two people but a union of cultures and musical styles. We then got the image of Bad Bunny handing his recently won Album Of The Year Grammy to a little boy in Puerto Rico watching on TV. Then, we saw him waving the Puerto Rican flag, shot from below to frame him almost as a general, a leader on a mission. America is bigger than you might think, the performance says. It's a call for community, but one that insists upon respect, not just for citizens of the United States, but for Americans. The statement is clear, but Bad Bunny isn't going to force anyone to listen.

We're ever-so-slightly closer to finding out what Brad Pitt's Cliff Booth got up to after he helped Rick subdue those hippie intruders at the end of Once Upon A Time… In Hollywood. A trailer for the long-gestating sequel to Quentin Tarantino's 2019 film debuted during the Super Bowl, with a healthy dose of censorship for the film's cigarettes, booze, nudity, and who knows what else. The trailer didn't even feature the film's title (The Adventures Of Cliff Booth, as far as we know), much less a release date. 



This film was first confirmed back in April, and is speculated to be based on what existed of The Movie Critic, a film that Tarantino had at one point intended to be his tenth feature but apparently abandoned. As far we know, that's the extent of Tarantino's involvement in the picture. At the time, it was reported that Pitt's Once Upon A Time co-star Leonardo DiCaprio was unlikely to appear in the sequel, which the trailer seems to validate. However, Variety reports that Scott Caan, Elizabeth Debicki, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Carla Gugino, Holt McCallany, and JB Tadena are all in the cast, as well as Timothy Olyphant, who returns from the first movie. David Fincher, who has an exclusive deal with Netflix, will direct. The film doesn't yet have a release date, either, but hopefully this can be one of those movies that gets one of those theatrical windows, of which the city slickers are so fond.

Staff Picks makes its 2026 return courtesy of News Editor Drew Gillis, who found a Broadway show that has its cake and eats it too, and Games Editor Garrett Martin, who recently got reacquainted with one of DC Comic's oldest superheroes. 



I'll admit I was a little skeptical going into Two Strangers (Carry A Cake Across New York) when it opened on Broadway last November after a successful run in London. If you know anything about the show, it's probably the opening number “New York,” an entry into the “greatest city on Earth!” subgenre of musical theater songs and the show's most viral moment. I had heard the song, along with a couple of others, at a press preview event earlier in the fall, and didn't expect to like the show very much when I was invited to a full performance. I'm happy to admit that I was wrong. 

As is generally the case with musicals, hearing the songs in the context of the story is a totally different experience than hearing them in isolation. On its own, I found “New York” a bit eye-rolly; in a packed theater, it was fairly thrilling. Two Strangers features only two actors: Christiani Pitts as Robin and Sam Tutty as Dougal, who originated the role in London and makes his Broadway debut in the part. Tutty's energy and enthusiasm, not just in that opening scene but throughout the show, was a huge source of my enjoyment. When he sang about how excited he was to be in New York, it hardly felt like a performance. He really was just that happy to be here. 

Two Strangers has the kind of title that seems to share the basic premise of the show. In truth, there's a little bit more to it. Dougal is in New York for the first time for the wedding of his father, whom he's never really met before. His father is marrying Robin's sister which, despite being more or less the same age, will legally make Robin Dougal's aunt. Dougal doesn't know anyone in New York, and begs Robin to show him around the city; she is reluctant but ends up letting him come with her to pick up the cake for the wedding. If you've ever seen any romantic comedy, you can probably tell where this is going. 

Fortunately, Two Strangers is legitimately quite funny, and having a fairly predictable plot is not a bad thing for a Broadway musical comedy. Though the score and the set and even the two-person cast feel like distinctly modern musical theater elements, there's something fundamental about the type of show that Two Strangers is. It's an original show, not based on some recognizable piece of IP, with songs that don't come from the radio and actors that aren't already famous. Seeing something like that on such a major stage feels increasingly rare. Two Strangers is the kind of throwback that makes me feel the slightest bit more optimistic about the future of this art form.

Doctor Fate (Image: DC Comics)

So you don't believe that there's a love in this world pure and powerful enough to bring a smile to the face of Darkseid, the cosmic despot devoted to enslaving the universe in a state of antilife? Well, Doctor Fate's love is higher than your assessment of what love could be—at least in J.M. DeMatteis and Shawn McManus' fairly obscure late '80s epic starring the DC Comics superhero. The full 24-issue run was collected into a single paperback edition last year, along with an annual and the Keith Giffen-drawn miniseries that preceded it; it's a curious and fascinating echo of a comics industry that bears little resemblance to today's.

Doctor Fate is one of DC's oldest characters, debuting in early 1940, but was never one of its most popular. That made him ripe for modernization in the second half of the '80s, during a company-wide period of reinvention after the Crisis On Infinite Earths miniseries. J.M. DeMatteis and his frequent collaborator Keith Giffen rebuilt the Golden Age sorcerer in a 1988 miniseries, introducing two new characters who shared Fate's bright yellow helmet: Eric Strauss, a 10-year-boy instantly aged into adulthood by the mystic Lord of Order known as Nabu, and his stepmom Linda, the young widow of Eric's rich, abusive father. Soulmates, the two unite to form Doctor Fate, with Nabu mentoring them from inside the reanimated corpse of the original 1940s Doctor Fate. Shawn McManus took over the art duties when a monthly ongoing series was launched a year after the limited series; with the addition of a talking demon dog sidekick, Doctor Fate was set with the specific characterization and supporting cast typically found in a standard superhero comic.

DeMatteis wasn't interested in the standard superhero comic, though. He used Doctor Fate as a vehicle for expounding on his own spiritual views, inspired heavily by the 20th-century spiritual leader Meher Baba—the same self-proclaimed “Avatar” that The Who's “Baba O'Riley” is named after. Baba even appears, unnamed, as a recurring character in the collection's second half, an ineffably wise, always silent guide to the afterlife who makes the mystical warrior Doctor Fate cry tears of joy with a single kiss. Eric and Linda Strauss, whose deeply uncomfortable, incest-bordering love for each other is justified as a millennia-old synergy between two souls who lived thousands of lives together, aren't characters so much as sounding boards for DeMatteis' Baba-influenced ideas: That the path to a better world and personal enlightenment lies in a love for everyone, an overriding sense of selflessness, and being at peace with the universe—at peace with fate, essentially. The late '80s and early '90s probably weren't the only times in history a creator could write a personal spiritual treatise in the guise of a legacy superhero who hung out with Superman and Batman and was owned by a massive corporation, but it's almost definitely the only time he'd be able to do so for 29 straight issues.

Doctor Fate sheds whatever subtlety it might've started with by the halfway point, before Doctor Fate is able to escape (and win the respect of) Darkseid by showing him the power of love. It becomes a little too blunt and didactic, but that also just means that it's the rare superhero comic with a strongly-held, personal point-of-view. Between that, the focus on Western spirituality, and McManus' heavily stylized, frequently psychedelic art, Doctor Fate recalls a number of DC comics from that era that preshadowed the creation of the Vertigo label, books like Grant Morrison and Richard Case's Doom Patrol, Morrison and Chas Trugo's Animal Man, and Peter Milligan and Chris Bachalo's Shade the Changing Man. It's not a surprise that one of the editors of Doctor Fate was Karen Berger, the longtime DC editor who spearheaded the launch of Vertigo two years after DeMatteis and McManus's time on the book came to an end.

Rarely mentioned since ending in 1990, the art's probably the main reason to read Doctor Fate today (unless you're a burgeoning Baba acolyte). McManus is as adept at expressing emotion in a character's face (or helmet, even) as he is at creating hallucinatory imagery from the spiritual plane. Still, DeMatteis' take on Doctor Fate gives modern comic fans a sense of just how weird DC was willing to get after Crisis. It wasn't just a handful of books still revered today as laying the groundwork for Vertigo that gave creators more freedom than superhero comics ever had before, but Justice League-adjacent titles like Doctor Fate, as well, as this collection proves across its 775 pages.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Relooted challenges who gets to own and tell African history","https://www.avclub.com/relooted-game-review","Mon, 09 Feb 2026 15:05:19 GMT","

Have you ever heard of Benin ivory masks? They are stunning works of craftsmanship typically carved from ivory with inlaid iron and copper, traditionally worn at the hip or around the neck. They depict the face of Idia, the first Iyoba (Queen Mother) of the Benin Empire that existed in what is now Nigeria. The masks are believed to have been carved to celebrate Idia's numerous political and military victories, including her role in elevating her son Oba Esigie to the throne of Benin ahead of his half-brother in the 16th century. When the British ransacked the Benin Empire in February 1897, several of these masks were looted and dispersed across the world thereafter. Two nearly identical masks are held separately at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the British Museum in London. 

History lessons like this abound in Relooted, from the Johannesburg-based studio Nyamakop. The Afrofuturist heist game offers engaging puzzles, a memorable cast, and a sharp answer for how to start fixing colonizers' centuries of wrongdoing. Nomali, an All-African freerunning champion whose speed has earned her the nickname Lightning, gets roped into her grandmother Professor Grace's plan to reclaim stolen African artifacts from private collections and auction houses across the world, returning them to the people they were taken from. 

What heist can be pulled off without a team? Alongside Nomali and Professor Grace are Nomali's brother and locksmith Trevor, the inventor Fred, Professor Grace's mentee Etienne, and later additions like the acrobat Ndedi, former MMA fighter Luso, and teen hacker Cryptic. While the full crew isn't immediately available from the beginning, this is the team players will use for their series of heists. 

These heists essentially have three phases. After an initial briefing that shares artifact and location details, players will case an area using Fred's robot Nunu to identify where artifacts and security traps are laid out. This is also where players assign locations for each teammate to use their abilities, like Trevor's skill for cracking open safe vaults or Cryptic's knack for hacking robots and security cameras. Next, as Nomali, players will prop open doors and shutters, bust windows, activate pressure plates, and move a lot of tables, all to craft the best escape route—one that ensures every artifact can be picked up on the way out without Nomali getting nabbed. Finally, once it's time to dash, players will use Nomali's exceptional speed and parkour skills to follow the escape route and use real-time, button-prompted speed boosts to beat a countdown that promises jail if Nomali doesn't get out in time. 



The heists aren't just puzzles to be cracked; they're also informative, including virtual exhibits of some of the most ancient and fascinating real-world relics across the African diaspora. In addition to the artifacts that are mission targets, there are other relics the team can learn about spread across the high-rises, mansions, and museums they're breaking into. These bonus relics are explained via short crash courses, the equivalent of the info one might find etched into plaques when visiting physical museums. These detours don't feel out of place given how they're woven into pre-escape exploration, leveraging these slower-paced moments as opportunities to share even more history that you'd rarely find outside of an elective class setting. 

In addition to its history lessons, what makes Relooted special is its uncompromising framing of how African artifacts left their homes. Before each heist, Professor Grace and Etienne will give background on an artifact's history that reveals not only its cultural importance, but also its often violent theft. Story after story features the triumphs and tragedies of African communities and civilizations that were so beautiful, so rich, and so layered in their various modes of life, that Western civilizations couldn't stop themselves from stealing everything in sight during bloody invasions, colonizations, and wars. The sheer volume of tales from all parts of the continent is a true testament to Africa's diversity, a refusal to let any player view the continent or its people as a monolith. 

Not once is the violence of these artifacts' displacement shied away from, nor is the illegal nature of Nomali and her family's nighttime activities. It's a clever choice that makes their mission a clear matter of justice—a challenge to anyone who believes all laws, the very ones that allowed these stolen cultural works to be on indefinite “loan” and hidden away when repatriation parties come knocking, are moral and must be obeyed despite their authors' intent and actions. The mission of the Afrika Appropriations Association (the best of several names Trevor gives the team) asks players to consider what constitutes a crime, as well as who are the real criminals. 

﻿

Relooted isn't just notable for its unflinching artistic statement, though. The heists are well-designed puzzles that smartly repurpose the tables and safes littered across their environments. By increasingly adding new security elements and options of escape, a successful getaway really does feel like pulling off a meticulously-planned scheme. This is helped by the fact that these heists aren't a Sunday stroll for Nomali. More than once I found myself restarting a level after realizing a teammate's abilities were better used on the roof instead of the basement, or after neglecting to find a method for keeping a shutter door open once the alarms start blaring, or after telling the wrong lie to an incredibly gullible robotic security guard. 

No puzzle is too difficult, but all require active engagement and attention to be cleared. Plus, should a player feel up to a harder challenge, there are a few ways to customize the experience, including four difficulty modes that affect the complexity of a heist and three modes for how much information is shared while casing a joint. It all coalesces in a way that ensures success primarily comes from a thorough understanding of a location's layout and the team's abilities—including the protagonist Nomali's. I was initially worried that she might get overshadowed by her peer's flashier skillsets, but her speed is an element that players must become intimately familiar with for more daring trips. By the time credits roll, there is no question why these expeditions would be almost impossible without her specifically.

In fact, the whole team grows to feel special over time, not just for their skills but also their strong personalities. Professor Grace carries the weight of someone who wishes they'd ushered in more change earlier in life. Etienne is a walking encyclopedia who isn't afraid to build a wishlist of optional targets. Trevor has massive little brother energy, which makes him both a nuisance and a lovable fool. Fred has a stern but warm personality that can comfort an entire room. Ndedi's honesty ranges from reassuring to outright funny, making him one of my favorites in the bunch. Cryptic has a refreshing confidence and adventurous spirit that steers her away from being just another tech-savvy teen. Even Luso, while a bit underdeveloped due to being a later entry, leaves an impression nearly as big as her muscles due to her straight talk and soft spot for animals and children. 



There's a bit of a Fast and Furious feel to the whole affair—also in part because of the camerawork for group shots and a few groan-worthy lines, from Trevor mostly. Family carries a more serious weight here in comparison to Dominic Toretto's memed-into-oblivion use of the word, though. The tone, while often upbeat, isn't afraid to get serious and explore the character's personal issues as individuals and with each other. Much like the artifacts being reclaimed, these folks have a history with each other. 

While these characters are a joy to be around, the linear story featuring them is less impressive. It is Relooted's biggest weak spot, further highlighted by the more interesting tales held by the artifacts being rehomed. In a weird way, this allows the artifacts' stories to take center stage, which pairs well with the game's central focus on Africa's history and who gets to tell it, but that doesn't mean these characters don't deserve a better-realized story of their own. 

Additionally, the villains read more like set dressing, excuses for the team to reclaim another artifact, rather than actual characters with strong motivations. Plot developments and twists would've benefitted from more breathing room, as currently they feel a bit rushed and lack the emotional impact they're reaching for. It is a story largely carried by the charisma of Team A Looting (my least favorite of Trevor's names), who, individually and collectively, are far more interesting than the plot.

Despite its narrative shortcomings, Relooted makes a deep impression. It's a history lover's dream, offering factual glimpses into a vibrant continent that Western civilizations have long been groomed to view as backward and conflict-ridden, while offering thoughtful puzzle designs, fast-paced action, and a charming cast of characters. It demands a fundamental change in how people view Africa and its place in the world, one that resonates more with every reclaimed artifact. 



Relooted was developed and published by Nyamakop. Our review is based on the PC version. It is also available for the Xbox Series X/S.

A former Pima County Homicide Detective shared his devastating take on the latest video plea released by Savannah Guthrie and her siblings as the search for their missing mother continues. 

“I saw the message last night,” the retired detective told Brian Entin on Sunday, February 8, in a video interview shared via YouTube. “Being from the outside, but using my training and experience, thinking back on the number of homicides that I've investigated…I don't think it's going to have a positive outcome of Nancy being returned alive.”

Savannah Guthrie and her siblings, Annie Guthrie and Camron Guthrie, released a video plea to their mother's alleged captors to “bring her home” on Saturday, February 7. As the reported ransom letter deadline looms, the former Pima County detective dissected the siblings' video.

“I think it was more of, this is just a guess, thinking it was more of, you know, ‘We intended to bring her back to you. Unfortunately, circumstances happened, but we still need to get paid and we'll return her remains to you or let you know where they are for x amount of money.'”

The unnamed retiree reiterated that his theory was “just [his] feeling on” the video shared via Instagram. 

“I'm praying and have been praying that she is returned whole and healthy, but last night's video from Miss Guthrie scared and caused me some concern about that happening,” he added. “I've never seen anything like this in my seven years in homicide, 20 years as a cop.”

Despite claims that the alleged captors would not be communicating with investigators or the Guthries, the “Today” host seemingly confirmed a new message was received. 

“We received your message, and we understand,” Savannah said in her Sunday video. “We beg you now to return our mother to us so that we can celebrate with her. This is the only way we will have peace. This is very valuable to us, and we will pay.”

Nancy Guthrie has been missing for more than a week. The 84-year-old is without her life-saving medication, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos revealed last week. 

According to a ransom letter received by TMZ, the Guthrie family was given two deadlines. The first, Thursday, February 5, at 5 p.m. passed. The outlet reported that the second deadline, Monday, February 9, at 5 p.m., “has more to do with consequences.” 

“I think everybody kind of knows the way this plays out when people write ransom notes,” TMZ's Harvey Levin told CNN's Anderson Cooper.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Sheriff Announces Major Decision in Nancy Guthrie Disappearance Case","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/nancy-guthrie-home-sheriff-presence/","Mon, 09 Feb 2026 02:34:54 GMT","

The Pima County Sheriff's Department shared a major update in the investigation surrounding Nancy Guthrie's disappearance. 

“At the request of the Guthrie family, PCSD will maintain a presence at Nancy Guthrie's residence for security,” the department shared via Twitter on Sunday, February 8. “Media & the public are reminded to follow all traffic & private property laws. No trespassing is allowed on the Guthrie property. Violations are subject to enforcement.”

The update comes as the search for the 84-year-old enters its second week with a ransom deadline looming. 

Moments before the Pima County Sheriff's Department shared its latest update, reports began circulating on Twitter as two marked vehicles appeared to be parked in Guthrie's driveway. 

According to the department, the security move comes at the request of Nancy Guthrie's family. 

Guthrie's Tucson, Arizona, home has been swarmed with reporters and independent journalists alike for more than a week. After detectives' initial search for evidence, a video began circulating online showing what appeared to be blood drops on the front porch of Guthrie's home. 

 Sheriff Chris Nanos later revealed during a Thursday, February 5, press conference that DNA results determined the blood belonged to the 84-year-old victim.

Nancy Guthrie's children, “Today” host Savannah Guthrie, daughter Annie Guthrie, and son Camron Guthrie, have made numerous pleas to their mother's alleged captors to “bring her home.”

“We received your message. And we understand,” Savannah said in a video plea shared to Instagram on Saturday, February 7. “We beg you now to return our mother to us so that we can celebrate with her.  This is the only way we will have peace. This is very valuable to us and we will pay.”

Guthrie's plea was addressed to their mother's alleged kidnappers after ransom notes were received by multiple news outlets. 

According to TMZ's Harvey Levin, who was the first to report receiving such a letter, the abductors included two deadlines in their demands. The first, which was Thursday, February 5, at 5 p.m., has passed. However, Levin told 

“So, the deadline that just passed had to do with the demand,” Levin told CNN on Thursday. “The Monday deadline has more to do with consequences, and Anderson, that's … about as much as I can say. I think everybody kind of knows the way this plays out when people write ransom notes.”

The second deadline has been reported as Monday, February 9, at 5 p.m. local time.

I would be terrified if you pay you may not see her again. If you don't you may never see her again. My prayer is that the Lord would have mercy. And move on their hearts to let this lady go home.

I find it strange someone wanting millions won't show proof of life. Doesn't look good for a safe return.

I believe if Trump gave baxk the president of Venenzuela to venenzuela they will let ber go its not about the money never the less god bless her and have mercy upon her soul

While there has been controversy surrounding the selection of Bad Bunny to be the halftime performer by the NFL, we have finally arrived at the big night. Yes, tonight is supposed to be about the Seattle Seahawks taking on the New England Patriots for Super Bowl LX, but we all know what tonight's truly about: the commercials and the halftime show!

WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD: THIS LIVE POST WILL BE UPDATED THROUGHOUT THE SUPER BOWL, SO DO NOT KEEP READING IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO READ SPOILERS.

KEEP REFRESHING THE PAGE FOR THE LATEST SUPER BOWL HALFTIME SHOW UPDATES.

The first half of Super Bowl 2026 is complete. While the game has been all about defense (Seattle leads 9-0 at the half), Bad Bunny is going to try to heat things up during this halftime show. Not going to lie, the first half had me falling asleep almost, so we all need the energy of Bad Bunny to wake us up!

8:15 p.m. – We have Maria Taylor and the guys talking about the first half of the game. Of course, they need some time to set up the stage for Bad Bunny. We are waiting patiently, but it should start soon. We'll get updates and the video posted soon.

We are finally on the football field, and we have some celebrity sightings, as Cardi B and Alix Earle are underneath him, doing some dancing. Then we see Jessica Alba and Pedro Pascal. Lots of grinding and dancing, and the energy is on fire. The crowd is pumped.

We have a fake wedding, then Lady Gaga takes over. She is singing “Die With a Smile,” but they definitely put some Latin flair to it. Lovin' it.

As we all knew, this show is almost entirely in Spanish. Do I know anything being said? For the most part, no. However, it's still so fun to watch. It's entertaining and fun to watch. Then we see a touching moment, as it's set up to make it look like Bad Bunny as a kid. Grown Bad Bunny shows up and gives him a Grammy!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","SEE: Drew Barrymore & Valerie Bertinelli Reveal Stunning Gray Hair Transformations","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/drew-barrymore-valerie-bertinelli-gray-hair/","Mon, 09 Feb 2026 02:34:35 GMT","

You might be used to seeing Drew Barrymore and Valerie Bertinelli as brunettes. However, when the two got together on Barrymore's show, they both tried a new look that involved gray hair.

“The Drew Barrymore Show” took to Instagram to share a video of Bertinelli's appearance, and added a caption that noted, “Celebrity hairstylist [Chris Appleton] pulls off the most unexpected hair transformation for Drew and [Valerie Bertinelli]! 😍”

In the video, Bertinelli first emerges in a gray wig before Barrymore also tries one on. Both ladies look amazing and absolutely slay the silvery shades.

Following her appearance on Barrymore's show, Bertinelli hopped onto Instagram to share a photo of herself in the gray wig. She also had a few questions for her followers, which she included in the caption of her post, writing, “Should I do it? Should I grow out my grey? 🤔😝 … But what is the real question—­the one lurking in the shadows—­ is it about something deeper? Does it have more to do with identity?”

“Who do I see when I look at myself? There's the version the world sees and the me that only I know,” she added. “No one else, just me. The inside me and the outside me. Is one more important than the other? Should they sync up? What if they don't?”

Noting that she “think[s] it's a little about self-­perception and the friction between how we feel and how we appear,” she went on to say that “[i]t's about the version of ourselves we feel comfortable showing. It's about how much of ourselves we choose to see in the mirror. What are we reflecting upon and what is reflecting back to us?”

Wondering if she's perhaps not alone in her thinking and questions, she continued, “I see so many beautiful women who gloriously grow out their grey and if I can be completely honest, I'm a little envious. I'm not quite sure I'm there yet.”

If Bertinelli does decide to let her gray hair grow, then she'll have a lot of support. Her friends and fans made that clear when they left encouraging messages on her Instagram post.

Appleton wrote, “You are so beautiful you can do it all.”

Actress Jennifer Love Hewitt also left a comment, saying, “You look hot.”

“One of the best things you'll ever do for yourself. Freedom,” came from another follower.

Someone else wrote, “Yes!! … it's the best decision I ever made. It's a process that will help you grow so much. 🙌”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘Below Deck Mediterranean' Star Malia White Welcomes First Baby","https://entertainmentnow.com/bravo/malie-white-baby-below-deck/","Mon, 09 Feb 2026 00:48:39 GMT","

Bravo family and fans have something joyful to celebrate: “Below Deck Mediterranean” alum Malia White has confirmed she's officially a mom after welcoming her first child with her longtime partner, Robert. 

The reality TV star — best known for her time on “Below Deck Med” as both a deckhand and later as bosun — kept the pregnancy largely private but shared the special news via Instagram in early February 2026.

In a meaningful photo carousel, White documented moments from her journey and concluded with an image of a tiny baby foot, captioned with a reflection on how far life has come.

The sweet post was captioned, “How it started versus how it's going.”

While White didn't originally publicly disclose her pregnancy timeline, the Instagram post served as her confirmation that parenthood has begun for her and her partner.

Friends and followers of the Bravo personality reacted with outpourings of love and excitement.

Comments from fellow “Below Deck” alum and fans poured in. 

Bugsy Drake wrote, “Best news ever!! So excited for you.”

Daisy Kelliher also sent her congrats for the new mom. 

“This lil girl has no idea how lucky she is to have a Mumma like you, watch out world,” chief stew Katie-Maree Flood wrote. 

It's a milestone that comes after years of White carving out a dedicated and adventurous life both on and off screen.

Fans of “Below Deck Med” might remember White for her unforgettable presence — she first appeared in Season 2 as a deckhand and went on to earn the respect of viewers by working her way up to bosun on several later seasons.

She also went on the appear on season 3 of “Winter House” in 2023. 

Off camera, she has consistently kept her personal life relatively private, though she's occasionally shared glimpses of her relationship with her partner, Robert, including travel and holiday photos. 

Although White didn't officially tag Robert in her baby announcement, her longtime bond with him had been documented previously — including appearances together in vacation photos and captions expressing joy and closeness. 

White also made a subtle pregnancy announcement just days prior to letting fans know she welcomed her first child. 

In another post that featured a carousel of images, White wrote, “Finally posting Sweden & a few ends of 2025 bits.”

In one image, White could be seen showing off her bump in front of a sign that read “She is future you.”

Stand-up comedian Chris Fleming recently joked that while other people are worried about the Olympics coming to Los Angeles in 2028, he's more concerned about the imminent release of Emerald Fennell's “Wuthering Heights” — in theaters from Warner Bros. on February 13. 

“I don't think the infrastructure we have in place can withstand the release of ‘Wuthering Heights,'” Fleming deadpanned in a viral clip, suggesting the box office would soon collapse under the weight of “pent-up erotic readers” demanding a twisted take on a classic period piece. 

 










It's a timely joke (with a regrettably short shelf life for Fleming) that nevertheless feels like a strong thesis amid growing excitement and even brewing resentment for Fennell's bold film adaptation of Emily Brontë's historic novel. A revisionist reframing of the tragic 1847 romance, the new “Wuthering Heights” has been a lightning rod for controversy from the start. 

Related Stories Timothée Chalamet's Box Office Worth as a Leading Man? A Cool 2 Billion Dollars Utopia Launches New Membership on Patreon, Complete with Online Screenings, Special Events, and More 

Allegations of racism emerged months ago when Fennell chose Jacob Elordi (a white actor) as her Heathcliff (an explicitly dark-skinned character). Now, amid an increasingly messy global press tour, that debate and several others are being hashed out — on and off the red carpet. Between Fennell, Elordi, and star/producer Margot Robbie, the result is a stunning media frenzy caught somewhere between a U.K. royal engagement and the “It Ends with Us” PR crisis. 

That clash could be the point. After making her fiery feature debut with the rape-revenge thriller “Promising Young Woman,” Fennell sharpened her public reputation as a provocateur during the promotion of her sophomore feature, “Saltburn.” The writer/director had a notoriously nonchalant interview style that made some fans question Fennell's core understanding of the script she wrote, while others pointed out that paradox as proof her buzz-building had worked. 

 










Now, cross-multiplying that evasive, unapologetic persona with the ever-confrontational literary audience, Fennell is betting big on “Wuthering Heights” to sustain enough conversation to become a genuine, money-making hit. With an estimated $80 million budget, it's LuckyChap's biggest commercial gamble on Fennell to date — and whether this wild press tour is a real mistake or just clever marketing, the film's rollout is officially high risk, high reward.  

It's not every day a 179-year-old ghost story lights up Instagram and TikTok, but “Wuthering Heights” has long been a volatile, obsession-worthy tale that readers struggle to get over. With Robbie name-dropping the mega-viral “A Court of Thorns and Roses” fantasy series (by Sarah J. Maas) in a recent interview for Bustle, the film's producers know the literary-minded audience they want for the opening weekend. But will the so-called “book girlies” turn on Fennell before then? 

“Wuthering Heights” readership is famously intense and unusually willing to litigate not just the original text's meaning but the fidelity and feeling of every film and TV adaptation since. Way before production on Fennell's movie even started, fans were taking to social media to argue about the casting, tone, and potential changes to the book. That speculation has only accelerated as the director, Robbie, and Elordi have promoted the project on the world stage. 

 










Fennell has been cagey about what she is and isn't adapting, insisting she isn't making “Wuthering Heights” so much as “a version of it.” Even the stylized quotation marks that frame the title on the film's official posters have been parsed for deeper messaging, effectively forcing baseless fan theories and more serious-minded cultural critique into an online scrum that's as overwhelming as the baroque fashion we've already seen the trio wear on several red carpets. 

Promoting a novel about the pitfalls of material wealth through obscene displays of luxury sounds a bit like hosting a “Great Gatsby” party at Mar-a-Lago. But there's precedent for this type of chaos. In 2023, following Fennell's Oscar win for Best Original Screenplay with “Promising Young Woman”, “Saltburn” arrived as a sneaky eat-the-rich saga dripping with irony. 

Starring Elordi and Barry Keoghan, Fennell's dark comedy about class resentment and covetous destruction was sold on the promise of erotic excess. The infamous grave scene. The even more infamous bathtub scene. These moments weren't just shocking; they were explosive choices that demanded explanation — particularly from a female filmmaker. And yet, Fennell broadly refused clarity, forcing viewers to decide for themselves what the strange script meant and if they liked it.

 










In her freshman feature, fronted by the straight-shooting Carey Mulligan) Fennell was more open to dissecting “Promising Young Woman” as a feminist allegory. But “Saltburn” saw the writer/director lean further into interpretive slipperiness and double down on her willingness to be disliked. That ambiguity didn't hurt Fennell's film but fueled its reputation. Teaming with LuckyChap again, Fennell seems to be taking that same approach with “Wuthering Heights” for a precarious, scaled-up version of a beloved story some people already feel they own.

Brontë purists don't have to love Fennell's “Wuthering Heights” for the movie to make its money back, but the idea that literary audiences don't matter to an adaptation once it's released misunderstands how fandoms still impact theaters today. From Harry Potter nostalgics to “Fifty Shades” converts, reading communities can be just as argumentative and influential as video gamers. Talking about a movie, good or bad, is free marketing, and Fennell seems to understand better than most that enraging potential ticket-holders is a promotional strategy. 

When questions surfaced about Elordi's casting as Heathcliff and the novel's racial implications, Fennell's response, rooted in her childhood perception, felt clumsy. The critique is valid, especially at a time when white supremacy threatens so much of Western culture. But the fallout from that incident demonstrates how outrage compounds — often in unexpected ways. Now, Fennell's loyalty to the book isn't just about plot; it's about identity politics and authorship.

 










That same week, Robbie attended the world premiere of “Wuthering Heights” in Los Angeles, wearing a necklace associated with Elizabeth Taylor. It was gifted to the actress by Richard Burton (he played Heathcliff in 1958), but it's widely known as the Taj Mahal diamond because of its historic ties to India. When Robbie told a reporter the necklace “was Elizabeth Taylor's” in a viral clip, a fly-by fashion fact became a heated debate about British colonialism and white-washed glamour. No one invented the outrage because the conditions were already there. 

There's discomfort in realizing that Fennell's interpretation is ironically faithful to the feel of the original material. In the novel, Catherine (Robbie) and Heathcliff (Elordi) are cruel, obsessive, and corrosive lovers whose attraction is more warning than inspiration. Introducing the pair through a press tour that intoxicates but doesn't welcome fans in feels, if nothing else, honest.

There's a punk-rock feminist streak to the film's promotional campaign so far. High fashion. Impenetrable confidence. An attitude that suggests women directors don't need your approval — because they are the ones in charge. With Charli XCX contributing the soundtrack, and both Robbie and Elordi leaning into “method dressing” for the red carpet, the extravagant rollout for Fennell's interpretation mirrors the book's warped fixation on prioritizing wealth over happiness. 

 










The luxury reads as alienating, but maybe it was always supposed to. For the Los Angeles world premiere, Robbie wore special rings (designed by CeCe Fein-Hughes) with Elordi, and the pair then did an interview about them in British Vogue. When “Wuthering Heights” debuted in London, Robbie wore a one-of-a-kind gown (designed by Dilara Findikoglu) modeled on Charlotte Brontë's Victorian mourning bracelet for her late sister. In a moment of profound economic anxiety, jewelry myth-making and couture symbolism can feel out of step. But the “Barbie” and Nate from “Euphoria” know better than most that celebrities can sell tickets. 

Audiences bring their own baggage to movie theaters, and Fennell's gambling that their fascination with her work will outpace any resentment they feel for how she treats the “Wuthering Heights” text. That bet extends to timing with Warner Bros. courting lonely hearts and contrarians alike with a Galentine's Day release that feels sort of off… but also not at all. 

When Robbie joked to Fandango that Fennell wanted viewers to “cry so hard they vomit” after seeing the film, she conveyed both caution and promise. Repeat viewings aren't guaranteed — but conversation almost certainly is. Professional reviews will set the tone as they always do. But the movie has already gone viral without them. Not only is social media overflowing with speculation, dissecting everything from elements of the trailer to the stability of Robbie's real-life marriage, but the press tour has also become its own sordid mystery framed by infinite perspectives. 

 










So, is it messy performance art or genius rage bait? The answer is yes. Fennell's refusal to explain herself turns maybe-manufactured marketing into an extension of the source material theme. In an industry that rarely grants filmmakers enough artistic latitude, the spectacle of a woman's creativity spiraling out of control becomes a statement unto itself. 

From Warner Bros. Pictures, “Wuthering Heights” is in theaters Friday, February 13.

During Super Bowl LX, a mysterious teaser for Netflix's long-anticipated “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” sequel made its explosive debut. A blink-and-you'll-miss-it flex for the streamer, the here-untitled film from director David Fincher and writer Quentin Tarantino brings back Brad Pitt as Cliff Booth: the sunburnt stuntman who helped the A-list actor walk away with his second Oscar, and the heart of Tarantino's Best Picture nominee, in 2019.

The project is rumored to be called “The Adventures of Cliff Booth,” and it's the first time since the mid-'90s that someone other than Tarantino has directed one of his screenplays. The surprise teaser leans into the film's overall sense of unexpected provocation, but the release time frame and plot details are still maddeningly opaque.

In the teaser, Cliff lounges at a bar, drifts through a few film sets, and tears around a dirt track in a derby car. The scenes are set to retro needle drops and punctuated by cheeky censorship gags (a scribbled-onto-celluloid effect) that blur out implied nudity, profanity, and violence with faux film damage. Elizabeth Debicki and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II flash by, and we see an Oscar statuette being placed on Cliff's desk — you know, in case anyone forgot just how beloved this particular character became.

Tarantino's story jumps forward into the 1970s, with Leonardo DiCaprio's Rick Dalton notably absent but a new ensemble (including Scott Caan, Carla Gugino, Holt McCallany, JB Tadena, and more) joining the returning Timothy Olyphant, who's back as real-life “Lancer” actor James Stacy.

 










A buzz-building roll-out makes strategic sense for the filmmakers and Netflix. Tarantino continues to expand Cliff Booth's mythology without counting another film toward his self-imposed ten-movie limit, and Fincher is deepening his already long-standing relationship with the streaming platform at a critical time for them. Shot in Los Angeles, the sequel went into production last summer.

From Netflix, “The Adventures of Cliff Booth” is coming soon. Tarantino joins Pitt, David Heyman, Ceán Chaffin, and Stacey Sher as a producer, with frequent Fincher collaborator Erik Messerschmidt on board as director of photography. 

Watch the teaser below.

Change is in the air for the “Star Wars” franchise. After 14 years of overseeing the I.P., Kathleen Kennedy stepped down as president of Lucasfilm last month, with Dave Filoni and Lynwen Brennan taking over the reins for Disney's galaxy far, far away. The shakeup also coincides with the first new “Star Wars” film to hit theaters since “The Rise of Skywalker” came out to mixed reception in 2019. A new “Star Wars” movie is always a monumental pop culture event, so it's fitting that “The Mandalorian and Grogu” debuted it first full trailer during Super Bowl LX. 

 










The new film sees Pedro Pascal reprise his eponymous role from the Disney+ series, with his adorable friend, nicknamed “Baby Yoda,” now receiving top billing, too. (Just think of the merchandising opportunities!) Other cast members include Sigourney Weaver, Jonny Coyne, and Jeremy Allen White.

“The Mandalorian and Grogu” is directed by Jon Favreau. It's his first film behind the camera since 2019's remake of “The Lion King,” though Favreau has spent much of those seven years working on “Star Wars” TV projects. He created both “The Mandalorian” and “The Book of Boba Fett,” served as an executive producer on “Ahsoka” and “Skeleton Crew,” as well as co-wrote the new film with Filoni, who also serves as an executive producer. 

 










It won't only be Disney+ subscribers watching when the popular show continues on the big screen. In a shifting entertainment industry, “The Mandalorian and Grogu” could be an inflection point for the entire “Star Wars” franchise. With the property torn between crowd-pleasing nostalgia and more innovative fare like “Andor,” this next film could be an indicator of the direction Filoni plans on going longterm. 

Disney will release “The Mandalorian and Grogu” in theaters on Friday, May 22. Watch the first trailer, which premiered during Super Bowl LX, below.

Got five dollars? Love movies? Maybe don't want to leave your house too much? Then indie studio and distributor Utopia has got a real treat for you. Today, Utopia has announced the launch of its Utopia Screening Room, a direct-to-consumer membership channel hosted on Patreon. 

For just five bucks a month, members can access “exclusive screenings of newly released films, fan favorite library titles, and new surprises each month.” Utopia, co-founded by Robert Schwartzman and Cole Harper, is the first independent film label to launch content on Patreon, the media and community platform for creators to connect with their biggest fans. This new venture continues their mission of getting movies in front of the people who most want to see them.

Utopia Screening Room will host and produce live online screening events and Q&As during the theatrical window for all upcoming releases. It will kick off this month on Thursday, February 19 with Nastasya Popov's acclaimed feature debut “Idiotka,” produced by Camila Mendes and Rachel Matthews' Honor Roll, and starring Anna Baryshnikov, Benito Skinner, Saweetie, Julia Fox, and Mendes. 

Imagined as a digital component to the more traditional theatrical release rollout strategy, Utopia will schedule each new Patreon screening events as “a digital stop on each film's release tour,” hoping to connect “audiences nationwide who love and appreciate independent filmmaking to some of the most exciting, emerging creative talents working in the industry today.”

 










Members will have the chance to watch each film live and engage directly with the filmmakers and participating cast in an intimate online setting. Can't commit to the set screenings? A recording of the live screening and Q&A broadcast will also be available to members for 24 hours.

“Our team has been building towards a membership program for many years and we're excited to give both our fans and filmmakers new ways to connect,” said Harper in an official statement. “While global viewership of film has never been higher, a huge majority are watching online. Launching the Utopia Screening Room will expand our reach to audiences wherever they are, giving people new ways to not only view films, but to interact with the creative teams behind each.”

Harper added, “Additionally, we will be offering real-world experiences and perks for our members through our premieres and theatrical releases as well as through events and social gatherings that give people a reason to leave home. The real opportunity is in strengthening the film-loving community to rally around independent film both online and in person.”

The Utopia Screening Room will launch with just one membership (“Cinephile”) tier for the very reasonable price of $5 a month. “Cinephiles” will aslo have access to virtual screening bonus content, ticket giveaways, special event pre-sales, exclusive party and event invites, a private Discord channel, exclusive company news and updates, home video bonus features, and more rare or never-before-seen content from the Utopia film library. 

 










Additional premium tiers are planned to launch throughout 2026, alongside upcoming content releases that will be announced at a later date.

The Utopia Screening Room is now up and running, right here.

There are plenty of box office milestones to attach to Timothée Chalamet's name. Over 3 billion bucks in overall box office take? He did it in 2025. Leading the top-two domestic box office winners in the space of eight months? He did it in 2024. Giving A24 its highest-grossing film of all time? Happened just this weekend, when Josh Safdie's “Marty Supreme” crossed $147 million at the global box office.

There's little doubt that the actor and three-time Best Actor nominee is a major box office draw, but Chalamet's resume is dotted with not just films in which he's very much the lead (“Marty Supreme,” “A Complete Unknown,” “Wonka,” the “Dune” franchise), but features that boast quite starry ensembles.

Just how big is Chalamet's own star power as a leading man, we wondered? Not to worry, Chalamaniacs, it's still quite big: over 2 billion bucks in global returns. Yes, we did the math.

While box office tracking site The Numbers counts 13 films in which Chalamet is the lead, we hewed down the list to nine titles in which he's easily and obviously the lead or co-lead (in five of those films alone, he plays the titular character). 

 










That means we didn't count films like “Little Women,” “Lady Bird,” “The French Dispatch,” “Don't Look Up,” “A Rainy Day in New York,” or “Hostiles,” in which the actor is one part of a big ensemble and couldn't reasonably be considered the lead (yes, we're sure there will be arguments that rebuff this thinking, and we're open to them).

But that still means that in films that most people would call “a Timothée Chalamet” movie, the just-turned-30-year-old has helped pull in over 2 billion dollars at the box office. We even made a chart!

And this total will only go up (duh) and fast, as “Marty Supreme” has yet to open in a number of international markets, and Denis Villeneuve's much-anticipated “Dune: Part Three” is gearing up for a December release (a slot that has previously earned the prior two “Dune” films over a billion dollars alone at the box office).

And while this 2-billion-dollar take doesn't yet place Chalamet in the tippy-top tier of his money-making acting brethren, consider this: of the current crop of top 10 earners, nine have made major money in traditional superhero roles (save for Tom Cruise, though we could all make the argument for Ethan Hunt as his own brand of superhero). Chalamet has yet to go that route, and still made plenty of money (and earned the kind of accolades that don't need to be sparked by Marvel or DC gigs) along the way.

Jonny Greenwood and Paul Thomas Anderson have accused Universal of breaching Greenwood's composer agreement for the Phantom Thread score, by licensing a piece of music from the film for Melania. Brett Ratner's controversial documentary on the first lady, Melania Trump, includes a long excerpt of “Barbara Rose,” a song the Radiohead guitarist composed for Anderson's film. They have requested its removal.

A statement released on their behalf reads:

It has come to our attention that a piece of music from Phantom Thread has been used in the Melania documentary. While Jonny Greenwood does not own the copyright in the score, Universal failed to consult Jonny on this third-party use which is a breach of his composer agreement. As a result Jonny and Paul Thomas Anderson have asked for it to be removed from the documentary.

Pitchfork has emailed Universal for comment.

The beauty of being a bedroom artist starts with privacy. When I listen to fakemink's early SoundCloud cuts and his 2023 debut, London's Saviour, I think of the blackout curtains that were on his windows, the sense of security that must've come from performing to an audience of none. Thanks to his singular ear for melody, the drug-tinged reverie that mink has crafted constitutes a world of its own in a landscape where “world-building” has been reduced to a buzzword. Each listen to “Just Kitten” or “Truffle” or “Shampoodle” reminds me of the strange sort of lucid dreams that don't overwhelm you as much as they trickle into your nervous system and stay there. It's intimate and intoxicating, spliced with enough playfulness—just look at the song titles—to offset the gloom.

On the opposite side of the coin, the Essex-born rapper-producer presents himself in contradictory ways. You can tell his approach is meant to be open and diaristic because of the way he gestures towards emotion. “Tryna get high, man, I really feel too low,” he spits on his new track “Young Millionaire.” “Turn the other cheek 'cause I know something that you don't.” But he remains elusive. The trite, unadorned depiction of anguish and the woozy psychedelia it's packaged in are as deep as the music gets. But that's also the point. The Boy who cried Terrified ., a short prelude to mink's upcoming album, Terrified, carries his double-edged sword into slightly new territory. The question is, how much does it really work? The hazy ambiance still feels enthralling, and the goofy asides and luxury vices that provide levity do too. But fakemink finds himself on the other side of fame without much to say about how it makes him feel.

Last year, in the wake of some internet hype from his SoundCloud loosies, a smash hit called “LV Sandals” shot fakemink's trajectory to the moon. Alongside Britain's most popular new hotheads, EsDeeKid and Rico Ace, mink rapped the simplest four bars he probably ever will in his life: “Louis V sandals/Crazy, hoes act scandalous/Yeah, these supermodel bitches be fans/Dropped the pack off to her man, and then I go hold hands with her.”

Between this and his solo electroclash breakout “Easter Pink,” fakemink was catapulted onto TikTok algorithms and festival stages and magazine covers with haste. Goes without saying how many times that “industry plant” conspiracy has been thrown around since. He's performed alongside Drake and Carti, received plaudits from Timothée Chalamet, and counts Frank Ocean as both a fan and a friend. Not to say he's suddenly become a household name, but The Boy who cried Terrified . feels like fakemink's first shot to establish himself in the same canon.

On opener “Blow the Speaker,” mink lies on a bed of thespian strings that cushion his signature pitched-up wail. The mix is cleaner than it has ever been; his voice is pushed to the front. “Running through the night, I feel alone,” he begins, at which I let out a sigh. “I only got my keys, no I ain't got my phone/Lookin' for the truth, you say that I'm not alone.” It's the kind of dull, cookie-cutter scene-setting that'd make the whole track feel like a missed opportunity if the eventual beat drop wasn't so lively. For better or worse, mink seems more spiritually aligned with (a young) Kid Cudi than he is any other musician: His preternatural knack for genreless ingenuity and alien melody is at risk of being bogged down by his pen at any point.

Thankfully, most of the songs here have too much juice to falter. The boy who cried terrified is ultimately just that—terrified—but he rides the high of his power trip without looking back. He's between L.A. and New York throwing guap, eating ice cream cake, and holding sexual tension with doe-eyed girls. At its peak, the music is as madcap as it is nervy, a hyperactive alloy of piercing melodies and whirring bass. The scumbag gusto that mink carries now screams, “I just got rich and you can't tell me shit,” like on “Dumb,” with razorblade synths that slice through scathing barbs aimed at someone he can't stand now. But tracks like “The Mercer” maintain that verve while undercutting it with the industry-induced paranoia he's faced with now. As geeked as he is to make his money, fakemink's acute fear of failure or selling out is apparent. “I'd kill myself before they ever clone me,” he trills on “Mr. Chow.”

In a way that feels aligned with his past work, the most forlorn elements of the production–the ambling countermelodies of “Mr. Chow,” the sweeping currents that wash over “The Mercer”–are buoyed by agile drumbeats and flows that command movement. (I'm glad that mink worked with close collaborators like cranes, Wraith9, and Moustafax2 to land on a sound that still feels like his own.) On the last song, “fml,” a Burial sample that conjures feelings of loss and regret is met with snaps and fuzzy 808s that provide a sense of warmth. “Maybe I'm a animal, maybe half-human/Life feel like a TV show, Truman,” mink declares on “Young Millionaire,” an undeniably corny opening line that still lands because of what you hear around it: kicks and snares in gleeful lockstep with each other, the resonant strings you'd hear on an early New Order record, plus mink's boyish vocal harmonies.

Back in 2009, on “Soundtrack 2 My Life,” a then-25-year-old Kid Cudi punctuated his last verse with “‘I am happy'/That's just the saddest lie,” a line that cut much deeper when I'd play it as an 11-year-old walking through the aisles at Michael's with my mom than it does now. But despite now being aware of how contrived the song looks on paper, the urgent conviction baked into the production and the performance still resonates with me. “Much of his songwriting is emotionally naked,” The New York Times' Jon Caramonica wrote of Cudi's Man on the Moon: The End of Day. “[The] star is reduced to a gaseous nonentity.” To some degree, fakemink's writing feels similar, as though the immediacy that makes him endearing also makes his sentiment too saccharine to really take seriously. Entertainment Weekly saw MOTM differently: “Cudi turns out to be that rarest of rap phenomena: a hyped upstart who really does represent a promising new phase in the genre's evolution.” fakemink seems to be cut from that same cloth, flaws and all.

Joshua Chuquimia Crampton's Anata proudly wears the disclaimer “Un-Mastered” on its sleeve, and is it ever. After a few tentative low-end thumps on the bombo italaque drum to introduce “Chakana Head-Bang!,” Crampton's guitar rends the sky, the motion of his hand across the fretboard finding a visual synchronicity with a meteor sweeping overhead, or a crack opening in the earth. This is some of the most elemental, in-the-red music ever recorded.

Crampton's indifference to mastering is inspiring on two levels. Firstly—as on Los Thuthanaka, last year's epochal culmination of his longtime recording partnership with sibling Chuquimamani-Condori—it's refreshingly indifferent to the streaming-era business model, where music is a lifestyle accoutrement meant to dissolve into an unobtrusive blur in the background. One cannot simply slot the songs on Anata into a playlist, not least because they'll probably be so much louder than anything else. The only way to experience Anata is to let it crash over you.

Secondly, it aims to capture the way the ceremonies of the Great Pakajaqi Nation of Aymara people—of which Crampton is a member—might be heard through a “phone camera,” flattened and crushed down to a few harsh bytes. This curious approach at first feels like an extension of a trend among underground guitar heroes like ML Buch (for whom Crampton has opened) and Klein, who find spiritual truth in the flat sounds of the post-analog era. But for Crampton, it's just as much about expressing the inexpressible, of acknowledging that some things are too alive and spontaneous to be done justice by a mere recording. And though this music might sound more scouring than celebratory to Western ears at first, Crampton, speaking to Tone Glow, proudly cites a review from a Bolivian critic who argued his music “wouldn't be out of place in an urban ceremony because it is a representation of ‘activated ceremonial music.'”

As far as newly coined genres go, that's not too bad. Electricity gives Crampton's music life, and it's hard to think of another guitarist working right now for whom the live current feels like such a fluid language. His music feels like it's guided by what Crampton is feeling more than by any audible compositional principle, alternating righteous heavy-metal riffage and harsh-noise shrieks (“Chakana Head Bang!”) with lustrous, stripped-down ambient pieces (“Jallu,” the second half of “Convocación ‘Banger/Diffusion'”). Crampton has been performing more regularly of late, and more than his previous four solo albums, Anata feels guided by the spontaneity and communal spirit of live performance.

At 25 minutes, Anata is Crampton's shortest solo album under his own name, but his most musically expansive. Though mostly focused on solo guitar and featuring none of the DJ-tag spam and baroque keyboard washes of Los Thuthanaka, Anata nonetheless finds room for Bolivian instrumentation, including the aforementioned bombo italaque as well as charango and ronroco lutes. The rhythms of Andean styles like salay and huayno have always been an undercurrent in Crampton's music, often played through palm-muted guitar riffs. On lead single and standout “Ch'uwanchaña ~El Golpe Final~,” the sweetness of the charango and ronroco provide the dominant sounds. It's like one of the huayno opuses of Los Thuthanaka shrunk down, well, to phone-screen size.

Crampton's tone has a lustrous quality, as if it's been filtered through sheets of gold leaf before finding its way to record. Jimi Hendrix is the primordial godfather of this stuff, as with any other music where the daisy-chain of effects feels like a tenacious and raging entity coexisting with the guitarist, even as Crampton's musical vocabulary largely bypasses the blues in favor of his Andean influences. There's DNA from any number of metal and J-rock riffers, and anyone who recognizes names like Flying Saucer Attack, Roy Montgomery and Sunroof! might find themselves swept up in a Terrastock flashback.

Yet listening to Anata, musical history falls to the wayside in favor of pure expression. In all of Crampton's work, there's the sense that the artist is grabbing you by the shoulder and demanding you feel what he feels; this time around the spirit of celebratory ecstasy is so strong that you might find yourself jumping to your feet when the huayno rhythm returns on “Mallku Diablón,” just as you might during a well-timed beat switch in a DJ set. This is the anti-colonial, anti-complacency guitar album of the very young year so far.

Bad Bunny performed the Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show tonight, February 8, at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. The reggaeton star brought out Lady Gaga, Ricky Martin, and more for a joyous set that paid homage to Puerto Rico and his desire to unite people around the globe. Watch clips from the show below or on YouTube.

Bad Bunny first took the field in a literal sense, rapping the Un Verano Sin Ti single “Tití Me Preguntó” inside a sugar cane farm while people in pava hats harvested the crop. Clutching a football to his chest and wearing an all-white outfit—including a football jersey emblazoned with the number 64 and his mother's last name, Ocasio, on the back—Bad Bunny walked through the field, passing people going about their daily lives: men playing dominos, women painting their nails, two athletes boxing, and stands selling coconut water, tacos, and piraguas.

Singing YHLQMDLG's “Yo Perreo Sola,” Bad Bunny then emerged in front of a traditional pink house—a staple of his shows, it's affectionately labeled La Casita—while dozens of dancers performed a synchronized routine on its front yard. Cardi B, Karol G, Pedro Pascal, Jessica Alba, Young Miko, and more hung out on the building's porch as Bad Bunny scaled its roof, occasionally rapping to a top-down camera hanging above him before sneaking in a bit of “Voy a Llevarte Pa' PR.” After crashing through the house's roof and landing in a family's living room, Bad Bunny exited to a brief sample of Daddy Yankee's classic “Gasolina” before launching into his own Grammy-winning single “EoO.”

“Everybody, believe in yourselves!” Bad Bunny called out in Spanish. Costa Rican conductor Giancarlo Guerrero—sporting a brown suit adorned with a sequined flor de maga, the national flower of Puerto Rico—led over a dozen string players in a romantic rendition of “Monaco” while a couple got married (for real!) on a courtyard. Dancers then stepped back to reveal Lady Gaga in a blue dress as she launched into a salsa take on her Bruno Mars duet “Die With a Smile” with Bad Bunny's backing band Los Pleneros de la Cresta. While wedding guests danced in circles and the happy couple sliced into an enormous tiered cake, Benito sang “Baile Inolvidable” then took Gaga in his arms and salsa danced with the pop star.

Bad Bunny later performed the Debí Tirar Más Fotos cut “Nuevayol.” Then, while everyone paced before a barbershop and corner mart, the reggaeton star called out “San Francisco!” and took a shot poured by Toñita, who oversees Brooklyn's last Puerto Rican social club. Off to the side, a family watched Bad Bunny's viral Grammy Award acceptance speech on a small, old-school TV set before the star himself approached them, handing the young boy his actual trophy.

The camera then panned to a musician playing the Puerto Rican cuatro as Ricky Martin popped up to sing “Lo Que Paso a Hawaii”—a song in which Bad Bunny considers the gringo-ification of Puerto Rico gaining U.S. statehood, akin to Hawaii's experiences. Riding that high, Bad Bunny picked up a Puerto Rican flag and bust out “El Apagón,” his Un Verano Sin Ti song, while three dancers twirled from power lines in pavas. Soon Benito joined them up there, scaling one of the utility poles—a reference to Puerto Rico's ongoing power grid struggles, a years-long reality the star documented in a short film.

When the jubilant beat of “Cafe con Ron” kicked in, Bad Bunny took off across his maze of a stage setup while all of the performers followed behind him playing instruments, waving Latin American flags, and jumping around. “God bless America,” he yelled, staring at the football in his hands. Bad Bunny then turned to the camera and, as if clarifying what that statement truly meant, proceeded to name every country in North and South America. Behind him, the football stadium's billboard displayed giant letters: “The only thing more powerful than hate is love.” He lifted up the football, emblazoned with the words “Together we are America,” and spiked it into the ground. At last, Bad Bunny allowed himself to experience the joy of it all, ripping out his in-ear monitors to sing “DtMF” while pogoing in the air and hugging his friends.

Technically, this wasn't the first time Bad Bunny performed at a Super Bowl halftime show. Back in 2020, he sang “I Like It” and “Chantaje” with Shakira, who co-headlined that year alongside Jennifer Lopez in Miami.

Earlier in the evening, Green Day performed a medley of American Idiot songs during the pregame Super Bowl LX segment. Afterward, Charlie Puth sang “The Star-Spangled Banner” while also playing keys, Brandi Carlile performed “America the Beautiful” with acoustic guitar, and Coco Jones sang “Lift Every Voice and Sing.”

The halftime show marked Bad Bunny's only stateside performance for the foreseeable future. His Debí Tirar Más Fotos World Tour, which kicked off last November and runs through May, includes no stops in the U.S. or Canada. In an interview with i-D, he explained, “there was the issue of—like, fucking ICE could be outside [my concert].” After Bad Bunny was announced as this year's halftime show performer, Corey Lewandowski, Donald Trump's former campaign manager, said during a podcast appearance “ICE will have enforcement at the Super Bowl.”

Last weekend, at the 2026 Grammy Awards, Bad Bunny took home the evening's top honor of Album of the Year, as well as Best Música Urbana Album, for Debí Tirar Más Fotos. He also picked up Best Global Music Performance for “Eoo.” At the beginning of the year, Bad Bunny was sued by a woman claiming that a recording of her voice was sampled on “Eoo”—the sample first appeared on “Solo de Mi,” from his 2018 debut X 100pre—without her permission

Jessica Pratt sings in a voice as gentle as unspun wool, but her stories feel deeply rooted, like they were born from a collective subconscious to reveal fundamental truths about human longing. Experimental pop musician Asher White gets at similarly heady ideas: leaving your city to seek reinvention, wondering whether your fate is predetermined. But where Pratt works primarily in the folk tradition, White's approach is decidedly contemporary, drawing from Palberta and 100 gecs' internet-laden glitchiness. Her music has the jangling, intentionally constructed commotion of an artist who synthesizes new sounds to understand something essential about the world she lives in.

As timeless as Pratt's songs have always been, she's followed a clear evolution since 2012's self-titled debut that's led her to glimmering pop songs like 2015's “Back Baby” and the haunted bossa nova of 2024's “By Hook or by Crook.” It makes sense that an artist as dynamic and freewheeling as White would be drawn to revisit Pratt's earliest work, when these ideas were first taking shape. On a track-by-track cover of Jessica Pratt, White leans into the spontaneity of this music with the jubilance of an ardent fan who sees the project as “an album of American standards [in which] every single song is a true classic.”

White fell in love with Jessica Pratt on the cusp of her 21st birthday, walking the streets of Providence in the blistering cold. Fittingly, there's a fluorescent sense of momentum to her renditions. Pratt's “Night Faces” is a song of remembrance. The guitar twinkles like the notes from a grandparent's music box, and Pratt elongates her words until they feel like a chant or a spell. Pratt didn't incorporate drums into her music until her fourth album, but White hits the ground running on her version of “Night Faces.” A drum kit and chugging bass lead in a guitar line as colorful and bright as a handful of marbles catching sunlight in your hands. Her layered vocal harmonies come in at acute angles that are just as odd as they are appealing. White's energy moves the song into the future—the chorus, “cry no tears,” becomes a rallying cry.

White's arrangements don't always sound so euphoric or neatly resolved. “Hollywood” is a song about the simultaneous allure and decay of Los Angeles and the singer's coming of age as she realizes a world she once idolized is less rosy than it seemed. The modulated, drooping vocals on White's version evoke melting Dali clocks and the unsettling psychedelia of “Strawberry Fields Forever.” It's the sound of a worldview dissipating. But the propulsion is there, too, in the way the synth pulses and glimmers. When White sings about Hollywood tumbling down, she relays the sense of freedom, in knowing that change is inevitable no matter how uncomfortable it is to witness or experience.

At times, the grandiosity of the arrangements can feel distracting. On the original version of “Casper,” the restraint of Pratt's delivery feels inextricable from the emotion she conveys. Over just a fingerpicked guitar, she sings, “You know I walk the streets of gold/And I can't find my baby's bones.” Her voice gently warbles and dips, carrying the ache of a woman “blossoming down” into her deepest sadness. I'm reminded of Hannah Horvath's lip quiver in the final season of Girls during a scene where she realizes the relationship she dreamed of no longer aligns with the person she wants to become. It's a moment of a loss so searing that a quiet gesture is the only way to represent it. The meandering guitar that begins White's version works beautifully alongside her falsetto. But halfway through, the song erupts into a vortex of reverb and electronic screeching. It presents the heartache too explicitly, overwhelming the subtle devastation of the lyrics.

White tells the story of making this album with characteristic irreverence—she jokes that she started the project as a means of procrastinating on other work and then exaggerated her progresses to label representatives. When asked to present the songs, White spent a frantic month finishing them. The results do sound chaotic, and at times haphazardly created, but they also allow White's best qualities to shine through. Her sprawling imagination, sense of self, and creative ambition push these covers into captivating forms. It's also a testament to the durability of Pratt's melodies and ideas that they resonate so well in a completely new environment. “I am calling out to you/From another place” she croons on “Bushel Hyde.” White sings from another place too, and it's one she's made all her own.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:rollingstone.com","All of the Hidden Symbols and Meanings You May Have Missed in Bad Bunny's Super Bowl Set","https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-latin/bad-bunny-super-bowl-meaning-1235513218/","Mon, 09 Feb 2026 14:52:11 GMT","


Bad Bunny is no stranger to making history, and last night, he conquered another first when he became the first artist to perform only in Spanish at the Super Bowl halftime show. Up until the big day, the only hint we had about potential themes for the show came from the Apple Music trailer that showed Bad Bunny dancing to his hit song “Baile Inolvidable” with a diverse cast of dancers. The vibe was unity and fun. But Bad Bunny always finds a way to get many complex messages into his performances, just as he does with his songs. 


	The performance had been even more anticipated because of the conservative backlash he received (to the point of Turning Point USA organizing an alternative halftime show). Additionally,  because of Bad Bunny's highly political Grammy acceptance speeches (he started one by declaring, “ICE out”), many people couldn't wait to see what Bad Bunny might say or do during his 13-minute halftime set. 


	But in true Bad Bunny fashion, everything was a surprise. The show featured many symbols of Puerto Rican history and culture, as well as gestures to the broader Latino community, and a strong reframing of U.S. notions of what it means to be American. Here are some of the significant symbols and history lessons that were wrapped up in the show that you just might have missed.

	











	The halftime show began with a wide shot of people working in sugar-cane fields before the camera panned down to Bad Bunny singing “Tití Me Preguntó” as he walked past people cutting cane with machetes. Sugar cane was the economic engine for many Caribbean countries in the 19th and early-20th centuries, including Puerto Rico. Sugar plantations have also long been symbols of the legacy of colonialism and slavery in the region. Enslaved Africans worked the sugar plantations until 1873, when Puerto Rico under Spanish colonial rule ended slavery. After the U.S. took over in 1898, U.S. sugar companies gobbled up Puerto Rican lands while reaping enormous profits off Puerto Rican labor and land. The laborers in the halftime show wore all-white clothes and straw “pava” hats, referencing the figure of the iconic Puerto Rican countryman, or jíbaro. Beginning the halftime show with sugar-cane fields and the agricultural laborers who harvested them both references a common image associated with rural Puerto Rican life, and nods to the history of colonialism that continues to impact life in the Caribbean.

	As Bad Bunny walked through the sugar-cane fields during “Tití Me Preguntó,” he passed various scenes: friends at a coco frío stand, a group of older men playing dominoes, young women getting their nails done, and then a piragua (Puerto Rican shaved ice) stand where Benito is served the treat before he keeps walking. The piragua stand is an icon of Puerto Rican culture that signals community and nostalgia. Piragua stands can be found all over Puerto Rico and the diaspora. In piraguas, the shaved ice is usually topped with tropical flavored syrups that are displayed in glass bottles on the piragua cart. During Bad Bunny's halftime performance, each glass bottle of piragua syrup on the cart featured a different flag, including Colombia, Spain, Puerto Rico, and Mexico. Besides the fact that the lyrics to “Tití Me Preguntó” reference women from each of those countries, the flags were yet another representation of Latino unity during the show. 


	On a screen above the halftime stage, viewers saw the animated character “Concho,” who is a key figure in Bad Bunny's DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS short film and album. Concho is a sapo concho, a crested toad endemic to Puerto Rico that is now critically endangered due to invasive species and the rapid development that is destroying its habitat. Just days before DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS came out, Bad Bunny released a short film of the same name. That film featured Puerto Rican actor Jacobo Morales playing an elderly Bad Bunny who reminisces with his friend Concho as they looked through photos. At one point, Morales' character heads to the center of town to purchase quesitos (a Puerto Rican puff-pastry roll filled with sweet cream cheese). He wanders down the street and encounters an American cashier trying to sell him cheese-less vegan quesitos. The short film, and the album as a whole, is a meditation on the dangers of gentrification that is rapidly transforming Puerto Rico. The endangered sapo concho is the perfect embodiment of the potential destruction of Puerto Rican life via U.S. colonialism and gentrification.

	Bad Bunny performed several songs, including “Yo Perreo Sola,” “Safaera,” “Party,” and “Voy a Llevarte Pa' PR” from the rooftop of the famed “Casita” (Spanish for “little house”). Bad Bunny fans were first introduced to the casita in the short film Debí Tirar Más Fotos. In the film, actor Jacobo Morales lives in a traditional cement house in the countryside of Puerto Rico. The house is very typical of the Puerto Rican midcentury homes that were built to better withstand hurricanes, in comparison with the much-older-style wooden homes. This home was pink, in the Puerto Rican tradition of painting homes a bright color, with shuttered windows and a carved wood door. These are the kinds of homes that are becoming less common with new development in Puerto Rico. Bad Bunny turned the casita into one of his stages during his 2025 “No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí” residency in San Juan. At the residency concerts, Bad Bunny performed on the porch and on the rooftop, bringing a different group of celebrity guests to the casita to party with him. On Super Bowl Sunday, the casita welcomed a host of important Latino celebrity guests such as Cardi B, Pedro Pascal, Young Miko, Karol G, and Jessica Alba.    

	











	The portion of the halftime show that featured a wedding, plus Lady Gaga and Bad Bunny singing “Baile Inolvidable,” was a partial replica of Castillo San Felipe del Morro, more commonly known as El Morro. This 16th-century Spanish-built stone fort borders part of the coast of the historic areas of Puerto Rico's capital city, San Juan. El Morro is now a national symbol of Puerto Rico so much so that it often appears on license plates, in addition to being a U.S. National Park and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. One of the most iconic elements of El Morro are the small stone turrets, or garitas, that were used as shelter for soldiers who were on the lookout for enemy ships. A small garita was featured on the back right corner of the El Morro-inspired set. 


	During Bad Bunny's performance of Nuevayol, he took a shot given to him by Maria Antonia “Toñita” Cay, or Toñita, a pillar of the Puerto Rican community in New York City and a link between the island and its diaspora. In the lyrics for “Nuevayol,” Bad Bunny shouts her out, saying, “Un shot de cañita en casa de Toñita/PR se siente cerquita” (A shot of rum in Toñita's house/Puerto Rico feels close). Toñita has run the Caribbean Social Club in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Williamsburg for more than 50 years. She has famously refused to sell her property, despite mass gentrification in the area. Given the issues Bad Bunny focuses on in DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS, it makes sense that he shouts out Toñita as an example of how the Puerto Rican community looks out for one another.


	As Bad Bunny performed his political-party track “El Apagón,” viewers saw the same cane workers from the start of the show hanging from electric poles. “El Apagón” literally means “blackout.” The song talks about both Puerto Rican pride and the frustrations of dealing with the frequent blackouts that plague the country. The longest blackout in American history was the nearly yearlong blackout Puerto Rico suffered after Hurricane María. This was a result of Puerto Rico's poorly maintained power grid, the severity of the storm, and massively inadequate and inhumane response by the U.S. government to the hurricane. The situation was so dire that many citizens taught themselves basic electrical skills and began risking their lives climbing electrical poles in order to begin reconnecting loose or damaged power lines and restoring power, sometimes to entire towns. This poignant moment in the show demonstrated the continuity between colonial exploitation of Puerto Ricans across centuries.  

	











	At the end of the show, Bad Bunny shouted “God bless América!” and proceeded to list nearly every country in the Americas from Chile in the south to Canada in the north. Then, hordes of people carrying flags of every country and territory in the Americas surrounded him. This celebration of the Americas follows a long line of Latin musicians — including Panamanian Rubén Blades, Puerto Rican Residente, and Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, among many others — who have written songs uniting the Americas against U.S. imperial interests. After listing all of the countries, Bad Bunny held out the football he carried off and on throughout the performance to the camera to show the words “Together we are America,” and said, “Seguimos aquí” (“We're still here.”). The phrase “Seguimos aquí” comes from a poignant moment in his short film about gentrification in Puerto Rico, but in the context of the halftime show, the phrase took on a new meaning. This was a powerful rebuke to the exclusionary rhetoric coming from conservatives that Bad Bunny was not American enough to perform at the halftime show, and that Latinos in general are suspicious foreigners who aim to destroy “real American” ways of life. Instead, Bad Bunny proudly declared that America is much more than the United States, and that the United States would not be what it is without Latino and Caribbean immigrants.

	For weeks people have wondered who Bad Bunny would bring out for the halftime show, with Cardi B as a clear frontrunner. Ricky Martin was another. Martin is familiar to U.S. mainstream audiences from his crossover in the late-Nineties Latin boom. At the time, Martin, already an established Latin pop star, began singing in English, and embodied a Latin-lover stereotype with songs like “Livin' la Vida Loca” and “Shake Your Bon-Bon.” But at the Super Bowl, we saw a different Ricky: Not only did he sing in Spanish, but he also sang “Lo Que le Pasó a Hawaii,” arguably the most politicized song on DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS. The song itself is a call to arms that Puerto Ricans should hold onto their culture and their land in the face of rampant gentrification and displacement that stems from centuries of colonial rule. During Bad Bunny's residency in Puerto Rico, a different guest sang this song every week. This was a full-circle moment: Rather than adapting to the tastes of mainstream U.S. for Latin-lover masculinity, Martin performed a Spanish-language defense of his homeland and a direct rebuke to the U.S. 

	











	There were various touches of light blue during the halftime show, a color associated with Puerto Rican independence. One notable pop of light blue was Lady Gaga's dress, which was adorned with the red flor de maga, the national flower of Puerto Rico. As the song “El Apagón” started, Bad Bunny emerged carrying a large Puerto Rican flag. Rather than the dark blue of the officially recognized Puerto Rican flag, Bad Bunny's flag had a light-blue triangle, referencing the island's original flag prior to U.S. takeover The U.S. later changed the shade of blue on the Puerto Rican flag to match that of the U.S. flag. As a territory of the United States, Puerto Rico has no sovereignty nor voting representation in the U.S. government. In this context, the azul clarito has become associated with movements advocating for Puerto Rican independence. On his song “La Mudanza,” Bad Bunny raps, “Aquí mataron gente por sacar la bandera/Por eso es que ahora yo la llevo dondequiera” (They killed people here for having the flag/That's why now I take it with me everywhere). This references the Ley de la Mordaza, or Gag Law, which banned Puerto Ricans from having a Puerto Rican flag, let alone criticize colonialism, from 1948 to 1957. So, Bad Bunny clutching his flag with azul clarito on the halftime show set was a powerful anti-colonial statement.

	From the good to the Bad Bunny to the cringe, Super Bowl LX had it all. And while the Seattle Seahawks trounced the New England Patriots, the real ones know that it doesn't matter who wins or loses on the field. And no, it also doesn't even matter how you play the game. The most important part of the night is, for many, the commercials. For the 2026 edition, the Big Game went big on the Backstreet Boys, butts (you read that right), and mushy ads that would warm up even a zero-degree day in New York City. And lest we forget AI: because before it's guaranteed to destroy humanity, at least we can make some entertainment out of it. Here are some of the most notable ads of the night. 


	Cue John Williams' famed fanfare! One of the most easily rewatchable movies of all time, everybody knows that the major crux of Jurassic Park happens when the power goes out on the island and hell breaks loose. In this Xfinity spot, which reunites Jurassic stars Sam Neil, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum, they get the park up and running again, no problemo, in a clever spot that combines the fan-favorite movie and the brand itself. And of course, they had to throw in some modern allusions, including selfies with dinosaurs. Say roar! I mean, cheese.


	Let us get this straight: it's a commercial for OpenAI, yet everything in it is analog? If you asked an artificial intelligence platform the main takeaway from this ad, it'd be hypocrisy wins. With images of people reading books, playing games, and faces like Einstein flashing on the screen, one would never think it's all meant to promote a product that bastardizes years of human ingenuity. Then again, it makes sense considering A.I. probably made the whole thing.


	Forget about A.I.: asses and butts are a trend this Super Bowl. And Novartis blew Kellogg's out of the water (no pun intended). Depicting zenned-out football players who are tight ends (get it?) doing yoga and relaxing on hammocks (listening, naturally, to Enya's classic “Only Time”), the ad promotes an early detection prostate cancer screenings. Considering the amount of fellas watching the game, it's silly while saving lives.


	Put on a red cardigan and tie your shoes in preparation to hear a sentiment America needs right now coupled with the powerhouse voice of a superstar and one of the most endearing songs, well, ever. Rocket and Redfin managed to recruit Halftime surprise guest Lady Gaga for their Super Spot where she lushly sings the iconic theme to Mr. Roger's Neighborhood. Teased in a black and white preview video dripping with saccharine and sincerity. As for the actual commercial for an otherwise unexciting mortgage company, was it covered with a bit too much smaltz, not to mention a little tone deaf — it takes a lost dog to get the white family to pay attention to their new neighbors? Perhaps let's just focus on the music.


	First they collaborated on The Favourite, then the deliciously twisted Poor Things, followed by the mindbending Kinds of Kindness, and then Bugonia. Their next project? Well, it's for SquareSpace. You read that right: visionary and eccentric director Yorgos Lathimos and Emma Stone teamed up for this unique spot for the website building platform complete with the duo's typical cinematic trademark, combining eye-popping cinematography and a dramatic performance in a commercial that's both dark and dryly hilarious. Is it too late to add a Best Commercial category to next month's Oscars?


	It's not that we have anything against this commercial. It's just that seeing the Mayor of Flavortown himself, Guy Fieri, dressed like a normal guy is downright freaky. When Fieri first posted a portrait of him without his trademark frosted tips and goatee (leaving out the fact that it was part of an ad campaign), the collective public let out a gasp. Will this get people talking? Yes. Will it sell Bosch appliances? Well, maybe not. What's Fieri without his flavor?


	Pass the chips.. and, the tissues. Snack brands are typically known for their asinine ads and catchy slogans. (Once you pop you can't stop, anyone?) Lay's went in the complete opposite direction for their latest Super Bowl ad, emphasizing the potatoes that make up those addictable chips and the folksy farmers who grow them. Designed to not only strike up a craving but tug at your heartstrings, the commercial is almost inconceivably directed by Taika Waititi, the visionary director behind out-of-the-box flicks like 2019's JoJo Rabbit (where Hitler himself serves as a boy's imaginary friend). It also gives us another reason to cry: Knowing Waititi was behind the lens, it couldn't have been at least a little bit kooky? It's like hiring Guy Fieri to make a meal without any spice.


	Sing it with me: “Instacart lets you choose your bananas!” We all knew Benson Boone is a man of many talents, from singing to backflipping. But who knew he could be this funny? In this retro-style spot from director Spike Jonze, Boone holds his own with Ben Stiller in a series where they play an Eighties-era singing duo that, in another dimension, could easily be a feature-length, made-for-streaming movie. Added bonus: a bona fide Boone flip. Would you expect anything less?


	We all know that Sabrina Carpenter has her share of boy trouble (looking at you, all you manchilds out there). But Super Bowl LX, she's trading steaming espresso for crunchy chips. In this admittedly funny commercial, Carpenter is seen dating a Frankenstein-esque man made entirely of Pringles. Featuring vivid CGI and some funny gags along the way, what earns this commercial WTF status is the fact that Lay's improbably switched up their iconic “Once you pop, you can't stop” logo to a refreshed “Once you pop, the pop don't stop.” Is nothing sacred? You can bet there were dozens of meetings about swapping their famed verbiage, grammatical incorrectness and all.


	Who wouldn't want to have a beer with Peyton Manning, Post Malone and Shane Gillis? Known for their perennial blockbuster Super Bowl ads, the Bud Light assembled a dream team of beer bros who convene at a wedding and tragically see a runaway keg. Cue Whitney Houston's timeless “ I Will Always Love You” as the poor keg rolls down a cliff, with the guys scrambling to chase it. From its personalities to music placement, humor and action, it all gives Bud Light a big reason to have one of the best ads of the Big Game.


	If you think about it, Charli XCX is brilliant at having it both ways. On one hand, she tears down and pokes fun at corporate America and packaged pop stars with albums like brat and her new movie The Moment, a feature-length commentary that skewers the idea of selling out. Yet at the same time, she happily inserts herself in the middle of the machine, cashing in with collabs like a pop-up performance for H&M, (from Times Square, no less), to her Big Game ad for UberEats last year. For 2026, Charli teamed up with the probiotic soda brand Poppi, where she and fellow It girl Rachel Sennott goof on “vibes, vibes and vibes,” complete with Poppi taking on the strobe-visuals Charli uses in much of her recent work (which, it bears repeating, lambastes selling out). Then again, is there anything more brat than saying one thing and doing another?


	It's a bubbly question as old as time itself that amounts to apples or oranges: Pepsi or Coke? For the latest shot in the so-called cola wars, Pepsi used Coca-Cola's imagery of their iconic polar bears for their own advantage by depicting a snow-white bear experiencing a crisis of identity who sips Pepsi and… likes it? Also directed by Taika Waititi, the rest of the spot plays out with bears seeing therapists and taking sad walks through the city. Bonus points for the allusion to the Coldplay couple, who went from cuddling at a concert to fodder for a commercial during the biggest game in the world.


	FA rap force since the early 2000s, 50 Cent is known for his gruff persona in and out of da club. For Doordash, the man with the half-dollar-moniker shows that he's actually a big softie, getting silly about beef. No, not the rap kind. The kind you can get delivered. Is there comedy in 50's future? To paraphrase a wise man: Get rich or die laughing.


	When it comes to William Shatner deciding to do this commercial, we have to assume he cashed the check first and asked questions later. Yes, Kellogg's Raisin Bran really spent the going rate of a reported $8 to 10 million to air a Big Game ad where they proudly announce to America that the cereal makes people… well, you know. And the legendary Star Trek Shatner allowed his last name to be associated with it? Pack it up, folks. We're done here.


	For the past couple years, the Dunkin' commercials with Ben Affleck and Matt Damon have been the hit of the Super Bowl. (Remember the orange suits and those wild cameos from Jennifer Lopez and Tom Brady?) So how do the boys from Boston top themselves for 2026? By recruiting a baker's dozen of throwback sitcom stars, reimagining their breakout Good Will Hunting as a Nineties-era comedy with the likes of Jennifer Aniston, Jaleel White, Jason Alexander, Alfonso Ribeiro, and Matt LeBlanc. Reminding one of a cross between Al Pacino's parody ad for Dunkaccino and Adult Swim's Too Many Cooks, aside from what appeared to be some weird de-aging, Dunkin' once again brewed one of the most memorable ads of the night. Extra points for a return of Brady, too.


	Backstreet's back, literally. The Nineties boy-banders made two appearances in the game: First in a surprise performance for a T-Mobile ad, and then in the form of the karaoke version — blue screen and everything — of their American classic, “Everybody” in which the entire country had a singalong. It was so realistic, it freaked viewers out, thinking a feed was crossed or a channel accidentally changed. But let this be a lesson: the more people complain, the more it'll happen. Remember the Tubi spot in 2023 when the screen turned into the menu from a smart TV? Now for better or worse, “everybody's” paying attention to Coinbase.


	What do you get when you combine Danny McBride, Keegan Michael-Key, Hailee Steinfeld, and a bona fide Bon Jovi classic? This deeply absurd ad for an otherwise dull insurance company known for their long-running series of ads with spokesperson Jake from State Farm. In years past, they've done everything from teaming him up with “look-alike” Drake to Arnold Schwarzenegger. This year, they doubled down on the splash with an all-star sing-along, with help from (cue the screams from their dutiful fan army) KATSEYE. Like a good neighbor, State Farm knows how to deliver the commercial goods. Now, about those premiums…

	With their comeback year in the books, Cross Canadian Ragweed are ready to embrace a once unlikely frontier: simply being a band again. “I told everybody, let's take advantage of our second chance, because we probably don't get a third one,” frontman Cody Canada says.


	Ragweed's run of sold-out stadium shows last year enabled Canada to cross off a bucket-list item this morning. Rolling Stone has confirmed the band will play its first headlining concert at the venerable Red Rocks Park and Amphitheatre outside of Denver on July 24, with an official announcement set for this morning. Tickets will go on sale Friday to the public, and the band will share pre-sale information on its website and via social media.


	When Canada and bandmates Jeremy Plato, Randy Ragsdale, and Grady Cross returned to the stage in 2025 following a 15-year hiatus, Red Rocks was not just a goal for Canada, it was the goal. “We have to play Red Rocks” was the first thing he recalls telling his agent, Jon Folk, when they discussed a possible reunion.

	











	“The first time I went, we opened for Dierks Bentley, and it was supposed to be us and Dierks doing High Times and Hangovers,” Canada recalls of Ragweed's first and only time at the venue on a 2008 tour with Bentley. “Then, they put a guy in the middle — we don't have to say his name — because he had a song on the radio. We got bumped to the first set, which was about 30 minutes, and man, I was pretty sore about it. I don't want to be a jerk, but it was kind of bullshit. I always kind of wanted to come back and do a full set just to redeem that moment.”


	The concert marks the third date in 2026 with Ragweed alone atop the bill. The band will headline the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo for the first time on March 16 and played the opening night of January's annual Mile 0 Fest in Key West, Florida, capping off a block party on Duval Street.


	Ragweed and the Turnpike Troubadours will co-headline at least four Boys From Oklahoma concerts this year, following last year's sold-out shows in Stillwater, Oklahoma, and Waco, Texas. The bands will play back-to-back evenings at Akins Ford Arena in Athens, Georgia, on Feb. 27 and 28 (they added a second night after announcing one and selling it out). The Castellows and Shelby Stone will open nights one and two, respectively.

	Ragweed's last show before Mile 0 happened in late August at Robert Earl Keen's Applause for the Cause flood benefit in New Braunfels. Canada says he spent the layoff obsessing over what to play in Athens, to the point that he enlisted Ragsdale, the drummer, to ease the pressure.


	“You want to know what I'm just really focused on in Athens?” Canada says. “The setlist. I've been wrestling with the setlist for a month, and I finally just gave it over to Ragsdale. He likes making it anyway, because of the tempos in the songs.”


	The Athens concerts are a prelude to a return to stadiums for Ragweed and Turnpike this year. They will play Stillwater's Boone Pickens Stadium again on April 11, with support from Stillwater resident Wyatt Flores, along with Shane Smith and the Saints, and the Great Divide. They will also bring the Boys From Oklahoma to Memorial Stadium in Lincoln, Nebraska, on Aug 22, with Cody Jinks, Flatland Cavalry, and American Aquarium joining.


	The full Red Rocks lineup will mark a poignant departure from those bills, which have been loaded with high-profile artists from the Red Dirt and Americana scenes. This one will be a family affair and feature a pair of second-generation Ragweed acts. Waves in April, a New Braunfels, Texas-based metalcore band featuring Canada's sons Dierks and Willy alongside lead singer Elle Gorman is one opener. The Smokin' Oaks, a Red Dirt four-piece that includes Cross's son, Slaid, and nephew, Colton Blake, is the other.

	“I remember Jon telling me, ‘If you get the Red Rocks offer, I don't see why you couldn't put all your boys on it,” Canada says. “So, it's gonna be Grady's boy and our boys, and I'm probably gonna cry more that night than I did the first night in Stillwater.”


	Unlike Turnpike, which has consistently played in arenas and amphitheaters since its 2022 comeback, shows of this scale are still new ground for Canada. Ragweed's initial run was as a club band and festival headliner until its 2010 breakup. Since reuniting, though, Mile 0 Fest has been the only Ragweed-headlined event not in a stadium or arena.

	“Smaller rooms are more nerve-wracking than stadiums, because there's no forgiveness. People can hear better and there's no chatter if you mess up,” Canada says. “When you play these big places, the energy is so full. You'd have to try really hard to blow it, both because it's so energetic and because it's like a dream.”

	When Bad Bunny was first announced as this year's Super Bowl halftime-show performer, President Donald Trump claimed not to know who he was. But after the Puerto Rican artist delivered an instantly iconic, unapologetic display of his Puerto Rican heritage, Latino unity, and the resilience of a unified community, the president has learned exactly who Benito is, and he is — to no one's surprise — crashing out. 


	Trump, who has long made Latinos and Hispanics central scapegoats of his political project, has spent the better part of the last year terrorizing immigrant communities — both documented and undocumented — with mass deportations, arbitrary detention, and racial profiling. Not to mention the unfettered abuses of a hyper-militarized Department of Homeland Security, ICE, and border patrol. Bad Bunny — who performed entirely in Spanish — did not explicitly mention Trump or his personal anti-immigration army, but the halftime show had a clear message for the president: Latinos are here, and they are America. 

	











	In a lengthy message posted to Truth Social shortly after the halftime show ended, Trump wrote that the performance was “an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn't represent our standards of Success, Creativity, or Excellence.” 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting,” Trump added, “This ‘Show' is just a ‘slap in the face' to our Country […] There is nothing inspirational about this mess of a Halftime Show and watch, it will get great reviews from the Fake News Media, because they haven't got a clue of what is going on in the REAL WORLD.” 

	











	“And, by the way, the NFL should immediately replace its ridiculous new Kickoff Rule,” he concluded. 


	The furious response came after the White House had publicly declared that Trump would not be watching the halftime show, and would instead tune in to Turning Point USA's alternate “Real American Halftime Show,” headlined by Kid Rock. 


	Just a week before the performance, Bad Bunny had used his speech during the Grammy Awards — where his most recent album, Debí Tirar Más Fotos, won Album of the Year — to draw attention to ICE's violent, frequently unlawful targeting and abuse against immigrant communities.

	“Before I say, ‘Thanks to God,' I'm going to say, ‘ICE out,'” Bad Bunny declared in his Album of the Year acceptance speech. The artist had previously excluded American cities from his album tour, citing concerns that his concerts — popular among all demographics but particularly by Hispanics and Latinos — would be targeted by ICE and the Trump administration's immigration-enforcement surge. 


	It seems the president — like many right-wingers who claimed to be boycotting the halftime show — couldn't resist the temptation of seeing one of the most popular artists on the planet, even if it was just to farm outrage bait.

	Turning Point USA may have tried to lead a boycott and counter-program the Super Bowl halftime show, but somehow nearly every right-wing influencer managed to watch Bad Bunny bring down Levi's Stadium — and they are furious. 


	The annual meltdown by conservative influencers and activists over the halftime show is about as predictable as death and the sunrise, a Super Bowl tradition alongside buffalo chicken dip and weird commercials. But this year the hysterical MAGA masses are in rare form. 


	As Immigration and Customs Enforcement continues to terrorize migrants around the country, Puerto Rico's very own Bad Bunny became the first Latino male artist to not only headline the halftime show, but perform entirely in Spanish. Bad Bunny used the national stage to celebrate Latino culture, focusing on his Puerto Rican roots. The star ripped through some of his biggest hits and brought out surprise guests, including Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin. He also invited a cast of celebrities to dance in his famed La Casita stage set. 

	











	During his 13-minute show, Bad Bunny was not overtly political but he did send a message of unity as he paraded flags from all over Latin America. Unsurprisingly, his set was the most exciting part of the night. Neither the Seahawks nor the Patriots scored a touchdown until the fourth quarter.


	Bad Bunny's hater-in-chief remains President Donald Trump who, despite statements from the White House asserting that he would not be watching Bad Bunny and would instead support TPUSA, immediately posted an angry rant about the performance. 


	The president wrote that the performance was “an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn't represent our standards of Success, Creativity, or Excellence,” and a “a ‘slap in the face' to our Country.” Trump also echoed the chief complaint of many right-wing detractors, that the performance was delivered in Spanish, the second-most spoken language around the world and in the United States.

	Megyn Kelly shared a similar sentiment. “Nah, I like my half time shows in English from ppl who love America,” she wrote in response to a political science professor telling her she missed out on the halftime show for opting to watch the Turning Point USA's version.

	











	Daily Wire host Matt Walsh — who claimed he hadn't watched the performance and only seen social media clips — complained on X that “having the halftime show for your biggest game of the year in a language almost none of your lifelong fans can understand, while waving the flags of countries that none them are from, is the biggest fuck you that l've ever seen a corporation give to its own.” 


	Walsh, like many others in his cohort, is apparently unaware that the NFL enjoys a global audience. Games are available in over 185 countries and over 25 languages. The league regularly hosts sold out games in non-English predominant destinations including Mexico City, Rio, Madrid, Munich, and Paris. Bad Bunny is one of if not the most popular artist in the world, dethroning Taylor Swift last year as the most-streamed artist on Spotify.


	Trump stan account “Catturd” wrote that “the Super Bowl in the USA just had a halftime all in Spanish. I'm dead serious, I will never watch a NFL game again as long as I live. Not one second.” In 2020, Catturd declared that he was “never watching the NBA, NFL, MLB, or NASCAR again — and I won't miss it one damn bit.” We'll see you next year, sir. 


	Right-wing filmmaker Robby Starbuck whined that “having Bad Bunny do the Super Bowl halftime show ENTIRELY in Spanish, in the United States is like playing the national anthem in Chinese at the World Series or replacing hot dogs on the 4th of July with tofu. It's just not right [the] NFL disrespected the fans and the country.”

	The national anthem was performed at the Super Bowl, in English, by Charlie Puth. Rolling Stone could not immediately confirm the presence of hot dogs in Levi's Stadium (we assume they were there), but we do know that Super Bowl attendees could purchase a braised veal shank burger topped with cheese fondue for $180 — and what's more American than corporations price-gouging a hunk of meat at an already ridiculously expensive sporting event? 


	Meanwhile, right-wing conspiracy theorist and Trump confidant Laura Loomer had a full-on meltdown as soon as Bad Bunny took the stage. “What the hell is this illegal alien farm worker non English shit on my TV,” she wrote in an X post. As a Community note informed Loomer, Bad Bunny is Puerto Rican and U.S. citizen, since Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory. That didn't stop Loomer from begging for an ICE raid to stop the halftime show in multiple posts. “SOMEONE CALL IN AN ICE RAID AT THE SUPER BOWL!” At one point, she even said the quiet part aloud. “This isn't White enough for me,” she wrote in a different post.

	Before the Super Bowl even kicked off, influencer Logan Paul let out an emphatic “no” when asked if he was excited about the halftime show. His lack of enthusiasm seemed to match his brother, Jake. Earlier in the night, Jake called on his followers to turn off the halftime show, describing Bad Bunny as “a fake American citizen performing who publicly hates America.” But it seems the Paul brothers weren't exactly on the same page. “I love my brother but I don't agree with this,” Logan wrote on X. “Puerto Ricans are Americans & I'm happy they were given the opportunity to showcase the talent that comes from the island.”


	Bad Bunny ended the halftime show with a cry of “God bless America!” and named list of the nations that comprise the American continents. Before a parade of flags, he held out a football emblazoned with the words “TOGETHER, WE ARE AMERICA.” Behind him, the stadium jumbotrons flashed the phrase “THE ONLY THING MORE POWERFUL THAN HATE IS LOVE.” It was some of the only English featured in the program. It's a message the right has had trouble understanding.

""Are they people?"" ""No."" Another creepy reveal to give you the chills. Universal Pictures has launched their 60-second Super Bowl TV spot for Steven Spielberg's new sci-fi movie titled officially Disclosure Day, set for release in June 2026 this summer. Still the only brief intro available (from the teaser trailer) is this vague sci-fi synopsis: If you found out we weren't alone, if someone showed you, proved it to you, would that frighten you? This summer, the truth belongs to 7 billion people... We are coming close to... Disclosure Day. The footage in this trailer reminds me of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, with Spielberg showing us many humans & animals being taken over by aliens. What comes next? Disclosure Day stars Emily Blunt, Josh O'Connor, Colin Firth, Eve Hewson, and Colman Domingo, with Wyatt Russell, Henry Lloyd-Hughes, Michael Gaston, and Elliot Villar. There's a few more interesting shots, and one final jaw-drop ""holy crap"" moment when an alien ship starts to break through the clouds at the end. What a tease! I'm sure this Super Bowl spot made tons of people sit right up & go ""WTF?!"" What you do make of this new footage?

Here's the full Super Bowl TV spot for Steven Spielberg's sci-fi movie Disclosure Day, from YouTube:









You can rewatch the first teaser trailer for Spielberg's Disclosure Day sci-fi movie right here to see more.

Sudha Chandran recalled a terrifying paranormal experience during a Gujarat shoot, claiming she sensed an energy pressing on her chest until prayer saved her. She also described eerie sounds on another set and a past trance at a Mata Ka Jagrata





Sudha Chandran




Veteran television actor and acclaimed Bharatanatyam dancer Sudha Chandran recently opened up about a harrowing paranormal experience she says she faced during a shoot in Gujarat, describing how it left her frozen and fearful until she turned to her faith for strength. The 60-year-old, who has long maintained she is sensitive to unusual energies, said she can “sense paranormal activity very quickly” and recounted the unsettling night in vivid detail.

Sudha explained that after a long day of filming, she reached her motel room around 11:30 pm, ate dinner and went to sleep beside her mother. She said she woke up suddenly to find a cupboard open and “could sense an energy moving towards me.” As the presence seemed to approach, she described it feeling like “a heavy weight pressing down on my chest.” She recalled desperately trying to speak or move, but “no sound was coming out.” Even though her mother was right next to her, she said she couldn't lift her hands.

Sudha said the energy seemed to grow stronger and “growling,” giving her the terrifying sense that it was “entering my body.” In that moment, she said her only recourse was prayer: “I took the name of Lord Kartik, somehow struck my mother with my hand, and suddenly my voice came back.” The heavy pressure, she said, lifted from her chest, leaving her shaken but relieved. Her mother then applied vibhuti, sacred ash, which helped her calm down.

In the same interview, Sudha also shared another eerie experience from a shoot in South India, where she said she often heard unexplained sounds at night, “the sound of anklets and the sound of a woman crying.” When she asked those around her about the noises, she said the reply was simply, “This place itself is like this.”

Sudha's accounts combine personal belief with spiritual interpretation. She believes her sensitivity to unseen energies guides her understanding of such experiences and underscores how deeply her faith and spiritual grounding shape her responses when confronted with what she perceives as the inexplicable.

Earlier, there was an incident at Mata Ka Jagrata where Sudha was seen dancing in trance, fans wondered whether she was possessed by the spiritual energies around.

An astrophysics column on big questions and our universe.

The grandest cosmic question remains unanswered: “Are we alone?“

Earth stands alone as a definitively inhabited world.

Although claims of alien life abound, they lack independent support.

“Canals on Mars” were merely optical illusions.

The Viking mission's promising Labeled Release experiment failed replication.

Microfossils in the Allen Hills Martian meteorite remain inconclusive.

Phosphine's presence on Venus, hotly debated, admits volcanic origins.

And extraterrestrial messages, including 1977's Wow! signal, allow natural explanations.

The challenge is confirming biological activity while eliminating non-biologic explanations.

The 7 Confidence of Life Detection (CoLD) steps outline how we'll get there.

1.) Detecting a biogenic signal.

This part's easy; ruling out non-biological alternatives is hard.

2.) Ruling out contamination.

Terrestrial life must be eliminated as the culprit.

3.) Demonstrating biological signal production in situ.

Determining plausible biological pathways represents a necessary step.

4.) Ruling out non-biological sources.

Like seasonal methane on Mars, chemical pathways often duplicate biogenic signatures.

5.) Confirming independent biological signatures.

We require additional, independent, supporting evidentiary lines for biosignatures.

6.) Eliminating all alternative hypotheses.

New discoveries always spur unconventional hypotheses; all must be ruled out.

7.) Independent follow-ups must confirm biological activity.

Robust biogenic indicators must be predicted, measured, and observationally validated.

Thus far, no claim has yet reached level 4.

Spielberg's 'Disclosure Day' Trailer Sparks Real Life Alien Theory Buzz","https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/what-sine-wave-language-spielbergs-disclosure-day-trailer-sparks-real-life-alien-theory-buzz-1777418","Mon, 09 Feb 2026 09:25:00 GMT","

Steven Spielberg's upcoming sci-fi thriller 'Disclosure Day' has already become one of the most talked-about Super Bowl trailer drops, with fans now connecting its mysterious alien themes to real-world conspiracy discussions.

The film, starring Emily Blunt and Josh O'Connor, revealed fresh footage during Sunday's broadcast, teasing a story centred on hidden government material and proof of extraterrestrial life. According to Variety's report on the Super Bowl trailer, the plot remains tightly under wraps, though the new scenes suggest a global shock over alien existence.

The new footage opens with a broadcast warning of a threat to release long-secret government information. Soon after, O'Connor's character appears to confirm that the discovery is not human at all, raising immediate tension about what exactly is being revealed.

Spielberg then leans into spectacle, showing action sequences on moving vehicles and a looming ship-like object emerging through the clouds. The director's return to blockbuster sci-fi has instantly reignited speculation online, especially among viewers drawn to alien disclosure narratives.

One phrase that has resurfaced in fan discussions is 'sine wave language', a concept sometimes referenced in UFO circles as a possible method of extraterrestrial communication based on sound frequencies and wave patterns.

While there is no verified scientific evidence supporting the existence of an alien 'sine wave language', the idea has gained traction in online communities that blend pop culture with conspiracy theories. The trailer's themes of hidden messages and secret material have made it fertile ground for those conversations.

Following the Super Bowl spot, social media and Reddit threads quickly filled with jokes and speculation. In one discussion on the r/movies teaser thread, users joked about filmmakers predicting alien language tropes decades ago, showing how quickly audiences link sci-fi storytelling with broader internet myth-making.

This kind of reaction is familiar territory for Spielberg, whose past films like 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' helped shape modern alien imagery.

'Disclosure Day' also marks Spielberg's first summer release since 2016's 'The BFG', signalling a return to the season he helped define with 'Jaws'. USA Today noted that the film's marketing began with cryptic billboards reading 'ALL WILL BE DISCLOSED', adding to the atmosphere of secrecy surrounding the project.

The film reunites Spielberg with screenwriter David Koepp, known for collaborations including 'Jurassic Park' and 'War of the Worlds'. Longtime composer John Williams is also returning to score the movie, strengthening expectations for a classic Spielberg-scale event.

The renewed interest in 'sine wave language' highlights how blockbuster sci-fi often spills into real-life speculation, even when the movie itself is purely fictional. Spielberg's trailer does not claim to be based on real encounters, yet its themes overlap with long-running alien disclosure myths that thrive online.

As 'Disclosure Day' heads toward its summer release, it is already shaping up to be more than a film trailer moment. It has become a cultural spark, blending Hollywood spectacle with the internet's endless appetite for extraterrestrial theories.

OHIO — Unidentified flying objects (UFOs) have been documented for centuries, with the first well-known sighting being documented in 1947, when businessman Kenneth Arnold claimed to see a group of nine high-speed objects near Mount Rainier in Washington, according to History.com.

Across the U.S. and other countries, several UFO sightings are documented each year. 

One study from the Canada Sports Betting shows the likelihood of being abducted by aliens, with Ohio ranking high on the list. 

The Alien Abduction Odds Index 2026 used data from the following sources to build its ranking: The National UFO Reporting Center, the Canadian UFO Survey, the U.S. Census Bureau, Statistics Canada, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Google Trends.

The study analyzed how often UFO sightings are reported, how many reports mention abduction-related details such as missing time and physical encounters, and whether reports appear consistently over time. 

Each location is then scored on a 0-100 scale, and then it is converted into an implied probability.

""The implied probability is not a prediction,"" analysts wrote in the study. ""It doesn't mean an abduction is likely to happen. It simply shows how often abduction-style reports have appeared in one region compared with others.""

In the U.S., Ohio ranks No. 21 on the list for probability, with a 1 in 89 chance (1.13%). 

New Hampshire took the top spot, have the most UFO sightings in the country. The study states New Hampshire has documented 24.34 UFO reports per 100,000 residents since 2019. 

For those looking for the state with the least probability of being abducted, New Mexico takes the cake, with just .23% probability (1 in 431).

While the dust has barely settled on 2026's Big Game, the Super Bowl logo for next year has already been unveiled.

Speculation is rife as usual as the Super Bowl logo's conspiracy theories are already ramping up. For those not in the know, the theory is that the colours in each year's Super Bowl logo, announced months before the actual game, reflect the teams that will make it to the Super Bowl, as well as who will win.

This year's LXI logo features orange and light blue, with the lower half of it looking like a wave. The logo is displayed on a purple background for the first time, which has also led to speculation. So which teams are going to win, according to this 'theory'?

 




Some are saying it'll be Dolphins vs Bears, perhaps the Eagles vs Broncos. ""Guys it's the bengals it's clearly a tiger eye,"" said one person on Facebook, while another person said: ""Yellow and red...Chiefs. Silver, dark blue and that aqua....closest nfc resemblance is Seahawks.""

So, let's be honest, with the number of potential teams in the mix, this theory doesn't really help us.

 




It was also incorrect for this year's game. Based on the logo, people thought last year that it was going to be Lions vs Ravens, Chargers vs Vikings or Bills vs Rams. When of course it was actually Patriots vs Seahawks who ended up in the final of 2026.

Some people who are really into the conspiracy theory think the colour at the bottom of the logo denotes who will win, in which case it'd be a team that plays in light blue.

Funds have continued to pour in to support workers affected by layoffs at The Washington Post, raising more than $700,000 across two GoFundMe campaigns.

The layoffs were announced last Wednesday, and within one day, a GoFundMe page had raised $350,000 for laid-off staff. Five days on, and around 4,700 supporters have donated over $520,000 to this page.

The GoFundMe, which launched just a few hours after company executives began cutting workers, was organized by Post reporter Rachel Siegel and other members of the newsroom's union.

A separate GoFundMe page for the Post's international employees has also raised almost $200,000 with about 2,100 donations.

According to the newsroom's union, the cut has affected hundreds of jobs at the organization.

A spokesperson for The Washington Post told Business Insider that it ""is actively supporting employees impacted by last week's restructuring, including transition support for our international employees.""

Post owner and Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, has drawn significant criticism over his stewardship of the company in the last few days. In a statement this weekend, he said: ""The Post has an essential journalistic mission and an extraordinary opportunity.""

""Each and every day our readers give us a roadmap to success. The data tells us what is valuable and where to focus.""

Kara Swisher, the tech journalist and ex-Post employee, gave $10,000 to the page set up for laid-off staff.

The former Washington Post executive editor, Martin Baron, appeared to have donated $9,000 in total, comprising $4,000 for the international staff GoFundMe and $5,000 for the general one.

Other top donors appeared to include longtime former and current staffers Dan Balz, Eugene Robinson, and Lois Romano.

Business Insider's Dan Whateley and Sydney Bradley previously reported that the amount of money in the fundraisers and the speed at which they hit six figures make them outliers among media layoff fundraisers.

Laid-off staffers at Vox Media pulled in about $7,000 in their January GoFundMe, while Teen Vogue got about $41,000 after November layoffs.

""Post Guild members have come together to support their colleagues with this GoFundMe,"" said a spokesperson for the Washington Baltimore News Guild last week.

The spokesperson blamed ""inexcusable business decisions of top Post leadership"" for the cuts.

""The Washington Post is taking a number of difficult but decisive actions today for our future, in what amounts to a significant restructuring across the company,"" a Post spokesperson said last week in a statement on the layoffs.

""These steps are designed to strengthen our footing and sharpen our focus on delivering the distinctive journalism that sets The Post apart and, most importantly, engages our customers.""

In this article

Monday.com's stock plummeted more than 21% on Monday after the project management platform issued weak guidance as it grapples with rising concerns that artificial intelligence is disrupting the software business model.

The Israel-based company called for revenue between $338 million and $340 million in the current quarter, short of the $343 million expected by analysts polled by FactSet. For the full year, Monday.com forecasted between $1.452 billion and $1.462 billion in revenue, versus a FactSet estimate of $1.48 billion.

Software stocks have sold off in recent weeks on rising AI disruption fears and worries that new agentic tools can replace them. 

So far this year, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) has plummeted 22%, while shares of Monday.com have already lost half their value.

During an earnings call with analysts, management defended the company's market position and highlighted new AI capabilities being implemented, such as agents and a vibe feature, to improve conversion and engagement.

""We don't see any impact currently from any AI company, and we're shifting our product, regardless, to be more AI native,"" said co-CEO and co-founder Eran Zinman. 

He said the company has pivoted messaging around ads and on its homepage to become more AI focused. 

However, management said it expects ongoing choppiness in the market this year due to near-term margin pressure from foreign exchange rates.

The software company reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.04 per share, excluding items, beating the 92 cents per share LSEG expectation. Revenue grew 25% from a year ago to $333.9 million, above the $329.6 million expected by analysts.

Monday.com forecasted operating income of $165 million to $175 million for the year, versus a FactSet estimate of $220.2 million.

Trump officials have repeatedly met with secessionist leaders from the province, which has large oil and gas deposits.

A separation movement in the Canadian province of Alberta claims to be gaining steam, and its leaders say they now have a meeting booked with U.S. Treasury Department officials. They will be asking for a line of credit worth $500 billion in U.S. currency to help transition Alberta from a Canadian province into a U.S. state.

Led by businessman Mitch Sylvestre, the Alberta Prosperity Project has launched a petition through a campaign called Stay Free Alberta to build support for a referendum to separate from Canada. The group has no official support from any of the elected parties in Alberta.

Behind its rallying cry of faith, family, and freedom, the Alberta Prosperity Project wants a new constitution for Albertans — one “that recognizes the Supremacy of God as foundational to Civil Society and the Rule of Law.”

Unlike in the province of Quebec, where separatist leaders hold elected office, Alberta's separatist movement has no formal foothold in its province's politics. Quebec, an overwhelmingly French-speaking province, is the only jurisdiction in Canada with a sizable sovereignty movement. That province had referenda in 1980 and 1995 that asked whether or not Quebecers wanted to separate from Canada, the latter narrowly failing. The separatist political party, Parti Québécois, is expected to form the next provincial government, and has promised a referendum in its first mandate.

Officially, the governing United Conservative Party of Alberta (UCP) is not advocating for sovereignty. Alberta Premier Danielle Smith says she wants Alberta to remain in Canada. However, the idea of sovereignty has been used by the UCP to try to push forward policies that the government of Alberta supports, especially related to oil and gas. On February 4, Smith issued a letter demanding that Alberta be given more say over judicial appointments. She also questioned why three judges of the nine on the nation's Supreme Court came from Quebec (Quebec is governed under the Civil Code and not Common Law. As such, it has more representation at the Supreme Court for when Civil Code matters arise).

Smith is using the sovereigntist movement to try to extract gains from Ottawa but is not formally supporting the movement. When pressed by journalists about members of her caucus having signed the pro-separation petition, Smith told the Canadian press that she doesn't “police” members of her caucus and they're free to sign whatever petitions they would like.

At the end of 2022, the UCP passed an act called the Alberta Sovereignty within a United Canada Act. It allows the Alberta government to challenge federal laws that it believes are an overreach into provincial jurisdiction (though the Canadian Constitution already allows for this). The UCP has also lowered the threshold of signatures required to trigger a referendum and extended the period of time to collect signatures. The separatists would need to have almost 178,000 signatures by May for a referendum to go ahead. There are 5 million people who live in the province.

The separatists would need to have almost 178,000 signatures by May for a referendum to go ahead.

Jeremy Appel, author of a forthcoming book about Smith, says there has been a sovereignty movement in Alberta going back to when the province first joined Canada in 1905. From the beginning, the movement was mostly concerned with fighting to maintain provincial control over Alberta's resources. Then, the federal government created the National Energy Program in the 1980s, which gave Ottawa more control over oil and gas in Alberta, to the chagrin of many Albertans.

Appel believes that the sovereignty movement has its roots in this history but projects its discontent on the ruling status quo. “Canada's state institutions have been completely hollowed out by neoliberalism and Smith is responding to this wave of anger and discontent stemming from that by … displacing the causes onto ‘woke' liberals in Ottawa and Montreal,” he explained.

Separatist sentiment rises when Liberal Party politicians are elected in Ottawa, and they tend to be calmed when Conservative Party politicians are in office, he added.

While polls show that popular support for sovereignty in Alberta is on the rise, there is also considerable opposition. Former Progressive Conservative provincial representative for Alberta, Thomas Lukaszuk, recently filed a petition to remain part of Canada. His petition collected 438,568 signatures and was submitted to the legislative assembly on December 1, 2025, one month before the deadline. If it meets the deadline with the required number of signatures, the question about separatism will be put to Albertans in a referendum. 

Alberta Prosperity Project leaders have met with U.S. State Department officials at least three times.

The Financial Times reports that Alberta Prosperity Project leaders have met with U.S. State Department officials at least three times.

Prime Minister Mark Carney reacted to the news that Trump officials had met with the sovereignty activists, saying, “I expect the U.S. administration to respect Canadian sovereignty.”

Appel points to the fact that it isn't just separation activists who are meeting with U.S. officials. Premier Danielle Smith travelled to Mar-a-Lago in January 2025, 10 days before Donald Trump's inauguration. Smith's current Chief of Staff Rob Anderson is a former member of the province's legislative assembly and an Albertan separatist who has an undergraduate degree from Brigham Young University in Utah. On social media, Anderson said the current movement to secede was triggered by Albertans' hatred for former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

British Columbia Premier David Eby reacted to this news by saying this to CBC: “If you are crossing a border to seek the support of a foreign government to break up our country because you don't have the support and the resources and the ability within our own country to advance that conversation, and you're asking the Americans or any other government, I mean that is the definition of treason.”

Trump has consistently referred to Canada as the 51st state, and this group of separatist activists might give the president some of what he wants. With the U.S. administration already meddling in Venezuela over access to oil reserves, Alberta could serve a similar purpose for Trump, giving the United States access to another large deposit of oil and gas. Appel believes that this movement could easily serve as a toehold for the Trump administration to get into Canada.

Trump has consistently referred to Canada as the 51st state, and this group of separatist activists might give the president some of what he wants.

Canada and the United States have a deeply intertwined energy market. In 2023, 21 percent of all Canadian hydrocarbon exports went to the United States, worth some $163 billion in Canadian currency. Of the crude oil that the United States imported, nearly 60 percent came from Canada and almost 100 percent of the natural gas came from Canada.

Alberta produces around 84 percent of Canada's crude oil. More than any other province, Alberta relies on the United States to purchase its oil.

First Nations leaders have been outspoken against the Alberta sovereignty movement. At a press conference, Trevor Mercredi, grand chief of Treaty 8 First Nations of Alberta, said: “Our treaties are with the imperial crown, not with the province of Alberta. Alberta has never been party to the treaties and has no jurisdiction over our lands.”

“I'm calling on all international nations and communities to support the First Nations movement in Alberta, to tell the Alberta government that what they are doing is unconstitutional, and that the foreign interference has to stop,” said Chief Allan Adam from the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation.

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Russia's military is scrambling to find alternatives to Starlink satellite internet after access to the network was curtailed, disrupting a key communications system that its forces had been using illicitly on the battlefield.

Ukraine said last week that Starlink terminals being used by Russian troops had been deactivated after talks between its defence minister and Elon Musk, whose company SpaceX operates the satellite network.

Ukrainian officials said the move had already begun to affect Russian operations, including the use of drones.

Moscow had come to rely on thousands of contraband Starlink terminals smuggled into Russia, often through central Asia, to keep units connected along the frontline. The system allowed Russian forces to coordinate movements and drone strikes in areas where military radios were unreliable or easily jammed.

Russia has no homegrown alternative that comes close in terms of speed, coverage or ease of use. Ukraine says Russian units had started fitting drones with Starlink terminals, improving their accuracy and making them harder to disrupt electronically.

Musk said last week that efforts made to block Russian use of Starlink had had an effect. “Looks like the steps we took to stop the unauthorised use of Starlink by Russia have worked,” he wrote on X.

The move was an early victory for Ukraine's new defence minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, given Musk's past reluctance to be drawn too deeply into the conflict and comments often seen as favourable to Moscow.

Ukrainian officials said they had introduced a “whitelist” system, allowing only verified Starlink terminals to connect to the network, in effect locking out devices believed to be in Russian hands.

It remains unclear how far the change will affect Russian forces on the battlefield. The shutdown, however, has prompted anger and frustration among pro-war Russian military bloggers who are closely embedded with frontline units.

“What everyone feared for a long time has happened,” wrote Yuriy Podolyaka, a Crimea-based video blogger with a following of almost 3 million on Telegram. “Elon Musk flipped the switch … our communications are in chaos.”

Another large pro-war Telegram channel, Dva Mayora, said the loss of Starlink had already been felt. “The deactivation of Starlink terminals used by Russian forces has had a negative impact on communications in our units,” it posted, adding that troops were rushing to set up backup systems that were “less convenient”.

Analysts say alternatives exist but fall well short of Starlink. For short-range links, units can rely on fibre-optic lines, wifi-based radio bridges or digital radio modems, all of which are slower to deploy and harder to use in mobile operations.

Russia also has its own satellite communications, including systems run by Gazprom Space Systems, which have been used on a limited scale during the war. But the company operates only a small number of geostationary satellites, meaning patchy coverage and lower data capacity.

Russian forces appear to be seeking workarounds to continue using Starlink, turning to intermediaries inside Ukraine and civilians prepared to register terminals in their own names.

“For the enemy, Starlink is so important that they are trying to build an entire network of people willing to register terminals for them,” Ukraine's defence ministry said on Telegram, alongside screenshots it said showed Russians advertising for Ukrainian nationals to activate the devices.

The issue has fuelled anger in Moscow that, four years into the war, the Russian army remains heavily dependent on western technology. “It is important to understand that relying on anything western in the current situation is dangerously overconfident,” said Aleksey Zhuravlyov, a State Duma lawmaker. “Even taking into account the active negotiations we are currently holding with the United States, that does not stop them from being our adversary.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The DOJ has withheld evidence from state investigators examining Good's killing.

Top Trump administration officials derailed an investigation into an ICE agent's fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good last month, fearing that a probe by federal agents in Minnesota would undermine the White House's narrative about the killing, according to a New York Times report.

Per the report, which cites anonymous sources with knowledge of the inner workings of the inquiry, just hours after Good was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent Jonathan Ross, federal agents within the U.S. attorney's office in Minnesota began preparations to investigate her killing as a potential civil rights violation. However, just after the office obtained a warrant to search Good's car — a process that would include examining blood splatters and bullet holes — they were instructed to halt the inquiry immediately by senior Department of Justice (DOJ) officials, including FBI director Kash Patel. 

Those senior officials were apparently concerned that the investigation, led by then-Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson, could contradict President Donald Trump's official (and demonstrably false) statements on Good's death, in which he wrongly claimed Good “ran over” the ICE agent, despite concrete video evidence demonstrating that never happened. 

DOJ heads then demanded that the Minnesota U.S. attorney's office shift its focus to different types of inquiries, including determining whether Good assaulted Ross prior to the shooting, or investigating her partner over her comments to ICE agents before the killing. No future order to investigate Good's killing as a civil rights violation was ever given, and the DOJ has indicated it will not pursue criminal charges against Ross. 

Thompson and five other prosecutors within the U.S. Attorney's Office resigned in mid-January, due in large part to the orders to investigate other angles of Good's death. After their departure, Attorney General Pam Bondi falsely claimed on Fox News that she had fired the officials because “they didn't want to support the men and women at ICE” any longer.

The feds have also blocked Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension from performing its duties, with the state agency alleging that the DOJ has withheld access to files and evidence from the case for its own inquiry. 

Many state officials have expressed frustration with federal investigators over their refusal to cooperate.

“I expect the federal government to provide the requested information, documents and physical items to our office. The federal government has been clear that they are not conducting an investigation into Renee Good's death. But we are,” Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said earlier this month. 

Several polls indicate that most Americans disagree with the administration's official stance on Good. 

A Marquette University Law School poll published last week, for example, shows that only 37 percent of respondents felt Good's killing was “justified,” as the administration alleges, with 62 percent saying it was not justified. Separate polling from CNN/SSRS last month found that only 17 percent of Americans would trust the federal government to conduct its own investigation into Good's killing, with 62 percent saying they would trust an inquiry conducted solely by the feds to “some” degree or “not at all.”

NEW YORK (AP) — The operator of roughly 180 Eddie Bauer stores across the U.S. and Canada has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, blaming declining sales and a litany of other industry headwinds.

The bankruptcy filing marks the third time in a little over two decades for the storied-but-now-tired brand that began as a Seattle fishing shop, later outfitted the first American to climb Mount Everest and made thousands of newfangled down jackets and sleeping bags for the military during World War I.

Eddie Bauer LLC said Monday it had entered into a restructuring pact with its secured lenders as it made the filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey.

Most Eddie Bauer retail and outlet stores in the U.S. and Canada will remain open as the company winds down certain locations. It noted that it will conduct a court-supervised sales process, and if a sale can't be executed, it will begin a wind-down of its U.S. and Canadian operations.

“This is not an easy decision,” said Marc Rosen, CEO of Catalyst Brands, which maintains the license to operate Eddie Bauer stores in the U.S. and Canada. “However, this restructuring is the best way to optimize value for the retail company's stakeholders and also ensure Catalyst Brands remains profitable and with strong liquidity and cash flow.”

Eddie Bauer's stores outside of the U.S. and Canada are operated by other licensees, are not included in the Chapter 11 filings, and will stay open, according to the release.




Authentic Brands Group continues to own the intellectual property associated with the Eddie Bauer brand and may license the brand to other operators, the company said. The operations of other brands in the Catalyst Brands portfolio are not affected by this filing and will continue in the normal course, according to the company.

Eddie Bauer's e-commerce and wholesale operations will also not be impacted by the wind down, as they are operated by a company called Outdoor 5, LLC. That was a transition it made in January and became effective Feb. 2.

Eddie Bauer joins a growing list of U.S. retailers this year that are closing stores, as companies reorganize under bankruptcy protection or pare down their operations to focus on the most profitable businesses.

The parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue said last month that it was seeking bankruptcy protection, buffeted by rising competition and the massive debt it took on to buy its rival in the luxury sector, Neiman Marcus, just over a year ago. A few days later, the parent company said it was closing most of its Saks Off 5th stores.

Amazon said earlier this month that it was closing almost all of its Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh locations within days as it narrows its focus on food delivery and its grocery chain, Whole Foods Market.

Eddie Bauer's namesake founder — an avid outdoorsman — started the company in Seattle in 1920 as Bauer's Sports Shop, according to the brand's website. In 1945, after making more than 50,000 jackets for the military, it launched a mail-order catalog.

“Bauer's Sports Shop was not just a place where people purchased clothing and gear, it was a community hub where folks gathered to share their wisdom, learn, and talk about their experiences in the outdoors,” the website says.

The company created an American goose-down insulated jacket, known as the “Skyliner,” in 1936, and it became the company's first patented jacket. It also outfitted the first American to climb Mount Everest — James W. Whittaker — with an Eddie Bauer parka in 1963.

After Bauer retired in 1968 and sold the business to his partner, the outdoor brand shifted more toward casual apparel and was bought by General Mills Inc. in 1971 and then by Spiegel Inc. in 1988. After Spiegel filed for bankruptcy in 2003 and most of its assets were sold, the remainder of the company was reorganized in 2005 as Eddie Bauer Holdings Inc.

In June 2009, Eddie Bauer filed bankruptcy and was acquired by Golden State Capital, the following month. In 2021, it was acquired by Authentic Brands and SPARC Group LLC.

A year ago, Catalyst was formed by the merger of SPARC and JCPenney, which Simon Property Group and fellow mall landlord Brookfield bought out of bankruptcy.

Rosen noted that even prior to the inception of Catalyst Brands last year, Eddie Bauer was in a “challenged situation.” 

“Over the past year, these challenges have been exacerbated by various headwinds, including increased costs of doing business due to inflation, ongoing tariff uncertainty, and other factors,” he said. 

He noted that while Catalyst's leadership was able to make improvements in product development and marketing, those changes could not be implemented fast enough to fully address the problems created over several years. 

Eddie Bauer had nearly 600 stores at its peak in 2001, according to CoStar Group Inc., a commercial real estate data firm. 

In a note published earlier this month, Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, wrote that while the Eddie Bauer name is “well known”, the brand hasn't kept pace with rivals like Swedish outdoor brand Fjallraven and Canadian label Arc'teryx. He also cited issues with quality deteriorating, which, for an outdoor brand measured by the performance of its products, is very problematic.

“And for many younger shoppers, the brand is seen as somewhat old-fashioned and a bit irrelevant, ” he noted.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt hit back at media outlets questioning the FBI seizing ballots and other documents related to the 2020 election in Fulton County, Georgia.

A federal judge in Georgia has ordered the unsealing of documents tied to an FBI raid that seized 2020 election ballots from a Fulton County facility, potentially shedding new light on the bureau's investigation.

Judge J.P. Boulee, who was nominated by President Donald Trump in 2019, gave the government until Tuesday to file the documents, including the search warrant affidavit with redactions.

""Although Petitioners originally filed this case under seal, both parties have now indicated to the Court that they do not oppose unsealing the docket or the motions filed by Petitioners,"" Boulee wrote in the order. 

""Moreover, Respondent has stated that it does not oppose the unsealing of the search warrant affidavit and any other papers associated with the warrant subject to the redaction of the names of nongovernmental witnesses,"" the order continued.

Rep. Thomas Massie's (R-KY) fight for political survival is bleeding into Kentucky's Senate race after two of the Republican contenders endorsed his challenger to curry favor with President Donald Trump.

Rep. Andy Barr (R-KY) and entrepreneur Nate Morris endorsed Ed Gallrein in quick succession on Thursday, leaving former Attorney General Daniel Cameron as the only major candidate to stay on the sidelines in Massie's race.

Massie, a libertarian and six-term House member, has embraced his status as a pariah in Trumpworld, owing to his opposition to the president's tax law and role in forcing the release of the Epstein files.

But Republicans, especially those seeking Trump's endorsement, want nothing to do with his candidacy and see Gallrein's entry into the race at Trump's urging as an opportunity to signal their loyalty to the president.

In announcing the endorsement, Barr's campaign said he would be hosting a meet-and-greet with Gallrein in Kentucky on Friday and dubbed Morris as “Late Nate” for offering his endorsement later the same afternoon.

Gallrein, a former Navy SEAL and state Senate candidate, touted their backing as a sign that “MAGA conservatives” are uniting behind him.

The endorsements mark the latest wrinkle in what has become a bitter race to succeed retiring Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY). Early on, that meant distancing themselves from McConnell, himself a foe of the president, and promising to be a reliable Trump defender in Congress.

Yet all three candidates have since turned to other Trump critics to cement their standing with the White House.

In this latest dust-up, Barr and Morris are pointing to donations the other gave to Massie in past election cycles. Morris, a Lexington businessman, donated to Massie in 2020 and 2022, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Barr, meanwhile, made a donation in 2020 through his leadership PAC.

(Trump first called for Massie to be “thrown out” of the GOP in 2020, but later endorsed him in 2022.)

The falling out between Trump and former Rep. Liz Cheney is another feud shaping the campaign, with Morris citing donations Barr gave through his leadership PAC to Cheney and three other House Republicans who voted to impeach the president in 2021.

Barr, in turn, notes that Morris donated to former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley two years before she challenged Trump for the presidential nomination.

“Those guys endorsing Woke Eddie isn't about my race. It's about their campaigns,” Massie told the Washington Examiner in a statement.

The Cameron campaign did not respond to a request for comment, but his team has largely stayed out of the mud-slinging between Morris and Barr as they seek to overtake him in polling. Until recently, Cameron had a comfortable lead over both competitors, but two independent polls released this week showed them siphoning off support, with Cameron now in a close second and Morris roughly 10 points behind.

A Trump endorsement could fundamentally reshape the race, given he won the state by a whopping 30 points in 2024. One poll from Quantus Insights found that almost half of Republican primary voters would be more likely to support a candidate who gets Trump's backing. A large percentage of voters are also still undecided.

For that reason, each candidate is not simply trying to signal their MAGA bona fides to Kentucky's voting electorate. They are appealing to Trump himself in the hope that he wades into the race, or at least decides not to back a challenger.

“I don't think that these guys endorsing Massie's challenger is really aimed at Kentucky politics,” said John Feehery, a Republican strategist. “It's probably more aimed at the White House.”

“I think that Trump has two things that he cares about – No. 1, are you loyal to him? And No. 2, can you win?” Feehery added.

Cameron lost a 2023 bid for governor to Democrat Andy Beshear despite a Trump endorsement and has struggled to keep up with fundraising in his Senate race. But his strong polling position is due in part to his name ID in the state and endorsements from a number of Kentucky officials.

Of the candidates, Barr has the largest campaign war chest and the backing of several House members aligned with the president, including former White House physician Ronny Jackson (R-TX), Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA), and Elise Stefanik (R-NY), the chairwoman of House Republican leadership.

But Morris is newly touting a $10 million cash infusion from tech mogul Elon Musk and has steadily pumped his own wealth into the campaign. In addition to Musk, Morris has endorsements from the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk, multiple Trump-aligned senators, and former White House strategist Steve Bannon.

Trump is not the only litmus test on the ballot. Morris is attempting to make the border a mainstay of his campaign, advocating a freeze on immigration until everyone in the country illegally is deported.

All three are also painting one another as too “woke” for Kentucky, a message that has seeped into Massie's race as well.

In a new ad, Massie claimed that Gallrein supports a “comeback” for diversity initiatives after “Trump crushed the woke agenda.” The ad, which flashes Trump on the screen, suggests that Massie understands the president's sway in the state, even as he bucks him on Capitol Hill.

Just this past week, Trump called Massie a “moron” at a prayer breakfast in Washington, prompting Massie to accuse him of being upset because “I'm still fighting for what he promised the American people.”

The two have had an on-and-off-again relationship for years, with Massie notoriously holding up pandemic-era spending over Trump's objections during his first term as president.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","The Mark Kelly Case Is Bigger Than It Seems","https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/02/pete-hegseth-mark-kelly-court/685911/","Mon, 09 Feb 2026 11:00:00 GMT","

A decision against the senator could affect all military retirees.

Of the many questions posed by those gathered in U.S. District Judge Richard Leon's courtroom last week, the most obvious one of all never came up: Why on earth was anyone here in the first place?

Until now, the military has pursued only a tiny number of criminal cases against retirees for actions that occur after military service has ended. Until now, the idea that the secretary of defense would accuse a lawmaker of treason simply for disagreeing with him would be laughable. Until now, any free-speech debates concerning sitting members of Congress have led to the conclusion that lawmakers ought to have—to borrow from former Chief Justice Earl Warren—the widest possible latitude to express themselves.

And yet there we all were anyway, gathered to see Mark Kelly—the fighter pilot turned astronaut turned U.S. senator—defend his First Amendment rights against an attempt by the Pentagon chief, Pete Hegseth, to silence him and knock down his military retirement rank and pay.

As someone who's covered 10 secretaries of defense, I've never seen anything like what Hegseth is doing—not even close. If Hegseth gets his way, he won't just be punishing Kelly; he will succeed in dramatically curbing the First Amendment rights of all military retirees, some of the very people who have fought to defend such freedoms.

At the heart of the case is a November video in which Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers—all veterans of the military or intelligence agencies—address U.S. troops, reminding them that they “can and must refuse illegal orders.” Their goal with the video was to push back against the president's domestic troop deployments, a trend his critics feared might lead to clashes with ordinary Americans or be used to interfere in upcoming elections. At the time the video was posted, Democrats were also assailing the administration over the legality of its air campaign against suspected Latin American drug boats. The lawmakers did not specify which problematic orders they had in mind.

Read: ‘An example MUST BE SET' 

The Trump administration's response was swift. Adviser Stephen Miller called the video an attempted “insurrection.” Donald Trump declared that the “traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL,” and reposted suggestions that they be hanged. Hegseth ordered the Navy to look into Kelly's “potentially unlawful” comments, something he was able to do because Kelly is the only one in the video who receives benefits as a military retiree. (Although some 18 million military veterans are living in the U.S., according to the Pew Research Center, a much smaller share of those people reach retirement status.) Kelly now receives lifelong retirement pay and is subject to rules, including the Uniform Code of Military Justice. In early January, Hegseth issued Kelly a letter of censure over his “seditious statements and his pattern of reckless misconduct,” which, Hegseth said, had harmed military discipline and undermined the chain of command. He also asked Navy Secretary John Phelan (a Republican donor and billionaire art collector with no naval experience) to begin a review of Kelly's retirement rank and pay.

The Trump administration's attempts to go after Kelly are, several legal experts told me, straightforwardly outrageous and without merit. But even if the judge rules in Kelly's favor, it's worth paying attention to this fight, because it underscores the degree to which the Trump administration is seeking to expand executive power in novel ways. Far more is at stake than the retirement benefits of one man.

The U.S. military has sought legal action against its own retirees only in a rare few cases—and those cases have typically involved egregious crimes, such as sexual assault. And although the military can prosecute sitting service members for prohibited speech—to make sure troops stay in line and follow orders, the military has strict rules prohibiting them from insulting public officials or making statements that undermine “good order and discipline”—several former military lawyers told me that no cases have previously been brought against a military retiree for something said after they hung up their uniform. “It's important for the public to understand the extraordinary power that the administration is asking the courts to bless,” Ryan Goodman, a former Pentagon lawyer who teaches at the NYU School of Law, told me.

If the government prevails against Kelly, it will establish a precedent for punishing retirees for statements perceived as out of line by whoever is in charge at the time. (The Trump administration denies that this case has any First Amendment issues to consider, saying that even as a retiree, Kelly has no right to undermine military discipline by encouraging others to question orders.)

Even before the Kelly episode, I had heard from numerous veterans about the chilling effect that Hegseth has had. The defense secretary—who insists on being called the “war secretary”—has used social media and speeches to vilify opponents, including former service members. Those who have worn the uniform are now less likely to criticize the administration's policy or personnel moves, because they fear for their benefits or worry about getting in hot water with current employers skittish about backlash from the administration.

During his first term, Trump mused about bringing senior officers whom he disliked, including Stanley McChrystal and William McRaven, back onto active duty and court-martialing them, but Pentagon officials talked him out of it, former Defense Secretary Mark Esper wrote in his memoir. Trump once insinuated that retired General Mark Milley, who served as his second chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, should be executed. Shortly after taking office, Hegseth stripped Milley of his security detail.

Expanding the military's ability to control veterans' speech would be a major and historic reversal of basic freedoms. Retired service members turned public officials have a long history of criticizing Pentagon leaders in ways those leaders might find objectionable. Dwight D. Eisenhower famously warned Americans about the corruption that would come from the unchecked growth of the military-industrial complex, focusing on the power of the people in mitigating “the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power” that would “endanger our liberties or democratic processes.” John F. Kennedy beat back the A bomb–loving generals he believed were as dangerous as Nikita Khrushchev. Veterans have often been some of the harshest (and most clear-eyed) analysts of the military's shortcomings.

I was thinking about this history as I watched Kelly stand at attention when Judge Leon entered the courtroom on Tuesday, a combat veteran who was doing just as new recruits are taught: holding his spine ramrod straight, fists curled back, thumbs aligned with the seam of the pants.

Leon, who kept his eyebrows positioned in a skeptical V for much of the hearing, seemed to be focused on that history too. How are veterans on Congress's Armed Services Committees, he asked, supposed to do their job if they can't criticize the military without fear of prosecution? Leon was visibly wary of the government's arguments, at times tipping into what appeared to be barely contained bewilderment. At one point, when the Justice Department attorney John Bailey conceded that there were “a few unique things” about the government's First Amendment–related claims, Leon barked back, “You think?”

Dan Maurer, a former Army lawyer and combat engineer, told me that Hegseth's decision to pursue administrative disciplinary steps against Kelly—rather than an attempt to court-martial him—was likely because a trial would leave Kelly's fate to a military jury. When I asked whether such a jury would convict Kelly, he laughed dismissively. “Absolutely not,” he said. Maurer, who teaches law at Ohio Northern University, said he believes that the administration's objective is more about demonstrating punitive action and appealing to the base than winning in court. “They don't care what the courts say, because they're going to depict them as liberal, woke courts,” he said. (Judge Leon was appointed by George W. Bush.)

Tim Parlatore, Hegseth's personal lawyer who now serves as an adviser in his office, suggested that the Pentagon might not pursue a criminal case against Kelly, because doing so would require him to be called back to active duty in the executive branch. This would effectively remove Kelly from his Senate seat and force litigation. “The Constitution prohibits somebody from holding office in two branches at the same time,” he told the Trump ally and Joseph McCarthy enthusiast Laura Loomer in December.

This brings up a second way that Hegseth's orders would expand Pentagon leaders' powers over military retirees. According to Maurer, who signed a letter from a group of retired military lawyers expressing concern about the actions against Kelly, the administrative procedure for reviewing and possibly reducing a retiree's rank and pay has never been understood to apply to actions that occur after retirement.

Read: Hundreds of generals try to keep a straight face 

Hegseth, who did not attend the hearing, has long expressed his disdain for the military justice system, advocating for lenient treatment of troops convicted of war crimes and deriding judge advocate generals, or JAGs, as pencil-necked “jagoffs.” The Pentagon spokesperson Kingsley Wilson said in an emailed statement that can only be interpreted as a non sequitur that Hegseth and his team would “do everything in our power to stop those who seek to harm Americans and the brave men and women defending our Homeland.”

But the government's lawyer seemed to stumble at times, struggling to defend Hegseth's actions. Leon noted that the cases the government had cited as precedent weren't a perfect fit; they were either First Amendment cases involving currently serving troops or cases about other kinds of crimes involving retired military personnel. (Bailey argued that they were relevant because retirees can be recalled to active duty to be court-martialed.) Bailey asserted that retiree speech could still undermine good order and discipline, and denied that Hegseth's actions would extend the reach of the military's punitive powers over retirees. (“I know you don't view it that way, but that's what you're doing,” Leon responded.)

Kelly's attorney, Benjamin Mizer, urged the judge to shut down the Navy's review because Hegseth's public statements had put his thumb on the scales. “He's not a decision maker who has kept an open mind,” Mizer told Leon. Federal courts have had a history of deferring to the military on national-security matters. Leon will issue a decision by Wednesday.

If the government prevails, the silencing of longtime service members would be like barring retired doctors from opining on health policy, Maurer said. When debating matters of war and peace, he said, it serves the public to hear from the very people who have served on the front lines—and lived through the consequences.

PwC is cutting down the number of US locations where entry-level consultants can start their careers with the firm.

The Big Four firm has limited hiring for new associates in the advisory division to 13 offices, Yolanda Seals-Coffield, chief people and inclusion officer for PwC US, told Business Insider in an interview.

Previously, entry-level consulting hires could join any of PwC's 72 US office locations. But since fall 2025, advisory associates have been assigned to one of 13 offices, which include key markets like New York, San Francisco, and Washington, DC.

Tax and assurance recruits can still apply to all of PWC's US offices, a firm spokesperson told Business Insider.

""The idea is that we want to bring people together in a connected way for those first couple of years,"" she said. PwC declined to provide the list of locations that will continue to hire entry-level consultants.

The isolation of the COVID years, combined with the way that AI is changing the nature of work, has chipped away at some of PwC's sense of connection around learning and development, especially for younger employees, said Seals-Coffield.

By consolidating junior consultants into fewer offices, PwC hopes to build a greater sense of community and encourage new recruits to grow together in their first two years, said Seals-Coffield. After that, they may move to different offices.

""You may start in Atlanta and then say, great, I've got my two years of experience. I want to go work in Alabama, which is where I'm from and where I really want to work,"" said Seals-Coffield.

Limiting the number of offices they can join will not impact overall hiring numbers, a PwC spokesperson told Business Insider. The firm continues to evaluate hiring goals annually to account for business needs and considerations, they added.

The decision to bring consultants together in their first years in the firm is part of PwC's broader push towards collaborative learning.

On Thursday, the firm launched the Learning Collective, a new workplace learning strategy focused on everyday, collaborative knowledge-sharing and developing the mix of human and AI skills needed for the future.

""Getting our people to spend more time together, learning and growing in an intentional way, is the goal of the experience,"" she added.

Upskilling the workforce for the AI future has become a top priority across all industries, but the pressure is particularly acute among the Big Four professional services firms and other consulting leaders such as McKinsey and Boston Consulting Group because of how rapidly the new technology is changing the nature of the work they do.

Straight advisory projects are being replaced with building, implementing, and maintaining tools for companies, requiring technology expertise over research skills. As consultants begin working with AI agents, they also need to sharpen their ""human"" skills, such as empathy and critical thinking.

The Food and Drug Administration said Novo Nordisk's TV advertisement for its newly launched Wegovy pill for obesity included ""false or misleading"" claims about the medicine's abilities and benefits to patients.

In a letter to Novo dated Feb. 5, the FDA said the ad misbrands the oral drug, making its distribution a violation of federal law. The agency requested that the drugmaker take immediate action to address the violations, which could include ceasing all ads containing misleading claims. 

In a statement Monday, Novo Nordisk confirmed that it received the letter and clarified that the ad has been running since the pill's launch, but is not the company's Super Bowl spot. 

""We take all regulatory feedback seriously and are in the process of responding to the FDA to address their concerns regarding the advertisement's presentation,"" Liz Skrbkova, Novo's head of U.S. media and stakeholder relations, said in the statement. 

It adds to the mounting hurdles the Danish drugmaker is facing as it scrambles to win back market share from chief rival Eli Lilly and cheaper compounded copycats in the booming GLP-1 market. 

The company's Wegovy pill is key to those efforts. It was the first-ever GLP-1 pill for obesity to enter the market in January, and Novo last week said more than 170,000 American patients are already taking the drug. 

Bloomberg first reported on the FDA letter on Monday. 

In the letter, the FDA said Novo's ad misleadingly suggests its pill offers superior benefits to other approved GLP-1 weight loss drugs. The agency said phrases used in the spot, including ""live lighter"" and ""a way forward,"" imply greater weight loss than other treatments and added benefits beyond that, despite no evidence to support those claims. 

The ad's statements ""misleadingly imply benefits beyond physical weight loss such as emotional relief, reduced psychological burden, hope, or direction for patients' lives, positioning the drug as a solution to broader life challenges rather than a treatment for a specific condition, when this has also not been demonstrated,"" the FDA said in the letter. 

The FDA also flagged the ad for failing to properly present risk information in both audio and text, a requirement for television drug advertising. 

Also on Monday, Novo Nordisk sued Hims & Hers, asking the court to stop the telehealth company from mass marketing compounded versions of its Wegovy pill and injections.

Bitcoin BTC$70,411.45 plunged early this month to nearly $60,000, wiping out large chunks of value across the crypto market and vaporizing some trading funds.

Most observers pinned the slide on macro forces, including the capitulation of spot ETF holders (and potential rumors of funds blowing out their positions). Yet another, quieter force, one that typically keeps trading running smoothly, likely played a major role in crashing the spot price lower.

That force is the market makers, or dealers, who continuously post buy and sell orders in the order book when you trade, keeping liquidity strong so trades happen smoothly without significant delays or price jumps. They are always on the opposite end of investors' trades and make money from the bid-ask spread, the small gap between the buy price (bid) and the sell price (ask) of an asset, without gambling on whether prices will rise or fall.

They hedge their exposure to price volatility by buying and selling actual assets (such as bitcoin) or related derivatives. And sometimes, these hedging activities end up accelerating the ongoing move.

That's what happened between Feb. 4 and Feb. 7 as bitcoin fell from $77,000 to nearly $60,000, according to Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research.

This episode shows bitcoin's options market increasingly swaying its spot price, mirroring traditional markets where market makers quietly amplify volatility.

According to Thielen, options market makers were ""short gamma"" between $60,000 and $75,000, meaning they held bags of short (call or put) options at these levels without enough hedges or protective bets. This left them vulnerable to price volatility around these levels.

As bitcoin fell below $75,000, these market makers sold BTC in the spot or futures markets to rebalance their hedges and stay price-neutral, injecting extra selling pressure in the market.

""The presence of approximately $1.5 billion in negative options gamma between $75,000 and $60,000 played a critical role in accelerating Bitcoin's decline and helps explain why the market rebounded sharply once the final large gamma cluster near $60,000 was triggered and absorbed,"" Thielen said in a note to clients Friday.

""Negative gamma means that options dealers, who are typically the counterparties to investors buying options, are forced to hedge in the same direction as the underlying price move. In this case, as Bitcoin declined to the $60,000–$75,000 range, dealers became increasingly short gamma, which required them to sell bitcoin as prices fell to remain hedged,"" he explained.

In other words, hedging by market makers established a self-feeding cycle of falling prices, forcing dealers to sell more, which further pushed prices lower.

Note that market makers' hedging isn't always bearish. In late 2023, they were similarly short options above $36,000. As Bitcoin's spot price rose past that level, they bought BTC to rebalance, sparking a rapid rally above $40,000.

Breaking a familiar pattern, bitcoin BTC$70,411.45 is on the rise during the U.S. session, climbing to $70,800 after falling to just above $68,000 earlier in the day.

Bitcoin is now higher by 0.5% over the past 24 hours, with ether ETH$2,063.57, XRP XRP$1.4281 and solana SOL$85.45 ahead closer to 1.5% over the same time frame.

Risk assets are generally in the green on Monday, with the Nasdaq up 1% and the S&P 500 up 0.5%. Gold is ahead 1.9% to $5,075 per ounce, and silver is up 7.4% to $82.50 per ounce.

""What we are experiencing is the weakest bitcoin bear case in its history,"" wrote Bernstein's Gautam Chhugani, reiterating the firm's $150,000 year-end price target on bitcoin. 

""When all stars are aligned, [the] Bitcoin community manufactures a self-imposed crisis of confidence,"" Chhugani continued. ""Nothing blew up, no skeletons will unravel; [the] media is back again to write an obituary.""

""Time,"" said Chhugani, ""remains a flat circle on Bitcoin.""

Getting a bit more technical, Schwab's Jim Ferraioli said it is helpful to look to bitcoin miners to determine when the bottom is in.

“Previous selloffs have usually bottomed near bitcoin's cost of production,"" said Ferraioli. ""Miners with less efficient equipment will often shut down operations temporarily ... We can see this in real time by watching the mining difficulty adjustment — as more miners leave the network, difficulty falls. Once it starts to rise again, that is confirmation the bottom may be in.""

Indeed, CoinDesk reported earlier that bitcoin mining difficulty just dropped by its largest amount since 2021 as at least some miners did capitulate to plunging prices.

Crypto platform Bullish (BLSH) is leading the sector higher on Monday with a 14..2% gain. Other big advancers include Galaxy Digital (GLXY), up 8.2% and Circle Financial (CRCL), up 5.1%. Strategy (MSTR) is up 3% and Coinbase (COIN) 1%.

Bitcoin miners who have pivoted to AI infrastructure are posting large gains as well as Morgan Stanley initiated positive coverage on TeraWulf (WULF) and Cipher Mining (CIFR) — both are up 14%. Hut 8 (HUT), IREN (IREN) and Bitfarms (BITF) are each ahead about 7%.","{'href': 'https://www.coindesk.com', 'title': 'CoinDesk'}","cryptocurrency"

Oops, something went wrong

Publicly traded Ethereum treasury firm BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) added another 40,613 ETH valued around $83.2 million to its industry-leading Ethereum stash last week, despite its unrealized losses currently sitting near $7.5 billion. 

The firm now holds 4,325,738 Ethereum worth more than $8.8 billion, representing about 3.58% of the circulating ETH supply. 

“BitMine has been steadily buying Ethereum, as we view this pullback as attractive, given the strengthening fundamentals,” Chairman Tom Lee said in a statement. “In our view, the price of ETH is not reflective of the high utility of ETH and its role as the future of finance.""

The firm has remained committed to acquiring Ethereum as it falls further from its August all-time high mark of $4,946. The second-largest crypto asset by market cap has now dropped 10% in the last seven days of trading, recently changing hands at $2,123 after falling as low as $1,824 last week. 

That rebound might be the start of a major recovery effort though, according to Lee. 

“ETH sees V-shaped recoveries from major lows. This happened in each of the eight prior declines of 50% or more. A similar recovery is expected in 2026,” he said, adding that the “best investment opportunities” come after declines.

The Most Surprising Bitcoin and Crypto Stories in the Epstein Files

The token will need a massive rebound in order to put BitMine back into the black on its purchases. The firm garnered an average acquisition cost of more than $4,000 per ETH on its first 3.7 million tokens, according to data from its latest quarterly report filed with the SEC.  

Adding in estimates from its acquisitions since November 30, BitMine currently sits on unrealized or paper losses of almost $7.5 billion, according to data from analytics platform DropStab.

Shares of BMNR are up around 3.5% on Monday, changing hands around $21.18 despite ETH showing only a 1.5% gain in the last 24 hours. Shares in the top ETH treasury firm are now down around 59% in the last six months.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

Investors withdrew $187 million from digital asset products last week, but the pace of outflows has slowed significantly. Historically, these changes reveal crucial inflection points in investor sentiment.

CoinShares stated that the deceleration suggests that panic selling may be subsiding, which may imply that the market could be stabilizing and that a potential low point in crypto prices might be forming.

In its latest edition of Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report, CoinShares revealed that the latest price correction pushed total assets under management (AuM) down to $129.8 billion, the lowest level since the announcement of US tariffs in March 2025, which also coincided with a local low in asset prices. Trading activity surged last week, which drove exchange-traded product (ETP) volumes to a record-breaking $63.1 billion.

This figure exceeded the previous peak of $56.4 billion recorded in October of the prior year. The strong activity indicates increased investor interest and momentum.

Investor sentiment was negative for Bitcoin, which experienced $264 million in outflows, alongside $11.6 million moving out of short positions. On the other hand, altcoins attracted fresh capital, as XRP led with $63.1 million, Solana $8.2 million, and Ethereum $5.3 million. XRP continues to dominate year-to-date inflows, recording $109 million. Chainlink and Litecoin saw more modest gains of $1.5 million and $1 million.

Additionally, multi-asset products raked in $9.3 million over the past week.

Outflows were concentrated in the US at $214 million, with Sweden at $135 million, and Australia at just $1.2 million. Despite this, other regions experienced meaningful inflows. For instance, Germany received $87.1 million, Switzerland $30.1 million, Canada $21.4 million, Brazil $16.7 million, and Hong Kong $6.8 million. The data highlights a mixed global picture.

Price weakness continues as Bitcoin slipped to $69,000 on Sunday and has hovered near that level into Monday. Despite this, Bitget CMO Ignacio Aguirre Franco said that the crypto asset has a path to the $150,000-$180,000 range this year if ETF flows stabilize and macro conditions improve. Ongoing Layer 2 development and growing DeFi activity strengthen Ethereum's outlook, the exec said while predicting a potential target of $5,000-$6,000 with increased traditional finance participation. Franco added,

“Regulatory developments like the recent Clarity Bill and advancing market-structure legislation will also positively impact crypto markets by providing clearer compliance frameworks that reduce uncertainty and make these assets more attractive to institutions and traditional funds. As institutional capital finds easier entry points and global regulatory alignment improves, overall market stability and innovation are reinforced.”

About us

Copy link

Dan Romero and Varun Srinivasan have joined Tempo, the upcoming stablecoin-focused blockchain, fresh off the acquisition of their previous venture Farcaster. 

The pair, who created the crypto-based social network in 2020, announced the move on their respective X accounts on Monday. It's not clear what specific roles the pair will fill at Tempo.

“Stablecoins are a generational opportunity,” Romero said on X. “I'm excited to work with Matt Huang, Georgios Konstantopoulos and the rest of the team to make them mainstream.” 

“Tempo is working on the most important problem in finance: building a global payments network that is fast, inexpensive and transparent,” Srinivasan said on X. 

Farcaster, which Romero and Srinivasan led for the past five years, was acquired last month by Neynar, a startup that builds tools for Farcaster developers, as it struggled to get the product to catch on with users.

As part of the deal, Neynar took over the protocol's smart contracts, code repositories, mobile app and Clanker, an AI token launchpad. Romero, Srinivasan, and several employees at Merkle Manufactory, the firm behind Farcaster, stepped away from day-to-day development.

After the acquisition, Romero said he plans to return all $180 million Farcaster raised to investors.

For Romero and Srinivasan, the move to Tempo keeps the pair at the pinnacle of the crypto industry.

Before founding Farcaster, they both worked at Coinbase. Romero ran consumer business and international expansion as a vice president, while Srinivasan directed the crypto exchange's engineering and product teams.

Tempo has been stacking talent in recent months.

The project, backed by fintech giant Stripe and crypto venture firm Paradigm, added former Ethereum Foundation researcher Dankrad Feist to its ranks in October. 

Former Optimism Labs CEO Liam Horne and Rice University Professor Mallesh Pai also joined late last year.

Tempo already counts over a dozen firms as partners, including Anthropic, Coupang, Deutsche Bank, DoorDash, Lead Bank, Mercury, Nubank, OpenAI, Revolut, Shopify, Standard Chartered, Visa, and Klarna.

In December, the project rolled out its testnet ahead of a full launch scheduled for later this year.

Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) added to its ether ETH$2,063.57 holdings amid last week's crypto crash, bringing its stack to more than 4.3 million tokens worth about $8.7 billion at the current price just above $2,000.

Led by Chairman Tom Lee, the company, which is the world's largest holder of ETH, purchased another 40,613 tokens over the past week, though it didn't disclose the average buy price. ETH began the week above $2,300 and plunged to as low as $1,700 before closing out the week just above $2,000.

BMNR shares are flat in early trading on Monday, though lower by 34% year-to-date.

""Bitmine has been steadily buying Ethereum, as we view this pullback as attractive, given the strengthening fundamentals,” said Lee in a press release. “In our view, the price of ETH is not reflective of the high utility of ETH and its role as the future of finance.”

Two-thirds of the firm's ETH, around 2.9 million tokens, are already staked, generating an annualized yield of $202 million.

For years researchers have tried to unlock the impressive underwater abilities of the diving bell spider, and new study details their best attempt yet.

Here's what you'll learn when reading this story: 

The natural world is humanity's greatest inspiration, and its influence can be seen all throughout our modern society. The nose of a bullet train slopes just like the beak of a kingfisher. Honeycomb-inspired architecture maximizes storage while minimizing building materials. Velcro closely mimics the hooked barbs of the common burdock plant. So, it comes as no surprise that in the pursuit of creating an unsinkable ship, scientists have once again ripped a page from nature's playbook.

This time, the engineering inspiration was drawn from one of the most fascinating arachnids in the animal kingdom: the diving bell spider (Argyroneta aquatica). This spider is the only member of the genus Argyronetidae and the only species of spider to live almost entirely underwater. However, it still does have to breathe air, so it creates a dome-shaped web known as a “diving bell.” Then, using its superhydrophobic (SH) arms and abdomen, it fills those webs with breathable air bubbles carried in from elsewhere in the environment.

“That was a very interesting inspiration,” Chunlei Guo said in a press statement back in 2019. For more than a decade, Guo has investigated ways to leverage the superhydrophobic abilities of the diving bell spider to create a material that's essentially unsinkable. In a new paper published in the journal Advanced Functional Materials, Guo and his team from the University of Rochester have created the most advanced prototype yet by simplifying and improving the technology in multiple ways.

In 2019, the team outlined a technique that etched complicated nano- and microscale patterns into metal so that they trapped air and created a superhydrophobic surface. Two treated parallel plates were then arranged facing inward, trapping enough air to maintain flotation while creating a waterproof compartment. After submerging this material under load for two months, the structure immediately resurfaced when the load was removed. The team published that outline in the journal ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces.

While this design proved promising, it wasn't perfect, as the structures lost buoyancy when turned at extreme angles.

“Importantly, we added a divider to the middle of the tube so that even if you push it vertically into the water, the bubble of air remains trapped inside and the tube retains its floating ability,” Guo said in a press statement about the new 2026 study, referencing improvements made over the 2019 study. “We tested them in some really rough environments for weeks at a time and found no degradation to their buoyancy. You can poke big holes in them, and we showed that even if you severely damage the tubes with as many holes as you can punch, they still float.”

It doesn't take much imagination to understand why “unsinkable” materials could be of significant benefit. Guo said that these superhydrophobic tubes can be rafted together to handle large loads or serve as the flotation bedrock of emerging green energy technologies like wave energy generators.

Vaccines to prevent herpes zoster have been associated with reduced dementia risk. We conducted a retrospective matched cohort study of Kaiser Permanente Southern California members aged ≥65 years who received two doses of RZV 4 weeks–6 months apart between 01 April 2018 and 31 December 2020, with no dementia diagnoses or dementia medications prior to or within 6 months of their second RZV dose. Cox regression with inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs). The study included 65,800 RZV-vaccinated individuals and 263,200 unvaccinated matches. Vaccination with two doses of RZV was associated with a 51% lower risk of dementia (aHR: 0.49 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.46–0.51]); aHRs were comparable across age, and racial and ethnic groups, but the risk reduction was stronger in females compared to males. In an evaluation of potential healthy vaccinee bias, the aHR of dementia for RZV compared to Tdap was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.67–0.79). Vaccination with two doses of RZV is associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of dementia in adults aged ≥65 years. After accounting for healthy vaccinee bias, RZV vaccination remains associated with a statistically significant lower risk of dementia.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Inside Bad Bunny's Historic Super Bowl Halftime Show","https://www.wired.com/story/bad-bunny-super-bowl-halftime-show-behind-the-scenes/","Mon, 09 Feb 2026 02:55:37 GMT","

Each time in its nearly 60-year history, putting on the Super Bowl halftime show gets harder. Sometimes the logistics get complicated by concerns about protecting the turf. On other occasions, some aspect of the show leaks online, as happened last year ahead of Kendrick Lamar's performance. In the lead-up to Bad Bunny's performance at Super Bowl LX, I wondered if worries about the possible presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at the Big Game would be the King of Latin Trap's biggest hurdle.

It wasn't. It was trying to fulfill Bad Bunny's wish to transform the field at Levi's Stadium into his home of Puerto Rico.

That one was Bruce and Shelley Rodgers' problem to solve. Their company, Tribe Inc., has been producing the show for nearly two decades, and the pair have become de facto experts in how to pull off increasingly elaborate stage productions during the allotted 26 or so minutes of the halftime show.

For Sunday's performance, situated in the middle of the Seattle Seahawks' rematch against the New England Patriots, the issue was horticultural. Bad Bunny, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, wanted his show to have the same look and feel as his recent Puerto Rico residency, which covered stages in palm trees and sugar cane to re-create the environs of Vega Baja, where he grew up.

In a different stadium, that could be done by rolling carts covered in those plants onto the field. But Santa Clara's Levi's Stadium, home of the San Francisco 49ers, uses natural grass; the National Football League's guidelines don't allow that many carts onto the field, as they'd tear up the grass. The max the team could use was 25, and they needed those for the stages and other props.

Bruce Rodgers' fix was simple: dress people up like plants.

As viewers saw at halftime, Bad Bunny, who performed in an all-white outfit with a number and “Ocasio” on the back like a football jersey, did get to dance around the set he wanted—the casita, the vintage truck, the wedding stage—but the plants were alive in a way he might not have imagined. Some 380 people donned costumes to make them look like tall stalks of grasses. The stationary palm trees and poles, if you're wondering, were rolled out much in the same way the streetlights were placed for Lamar's street scene from Super Bowl LIX. On Sunday, they hit their limit of 25 carts, equipped with so-called “turf tires,” and got everything safely on and off the field.

The tall grass was actually people.

There were other obstacles, too. For instance, there's only one main field tunnel at Levi's Stadium—and the venue is open-air. Lamar was able to use the darkness provided by the Caesars Superdome for dramatic effect during his 2025 show, but Bad Bunny couldn't do the same.

“It's all done in daylight,” says Shelley Rodgers, who serves as the show's art director and won Emmys for her work on Rihanna's halftime show in 2023 and the one that Dr. Dre headlined in 2022. “You don't get the theatricality of nighttime.”

As viewers saw on Sunday, the plan worked. Starting at the casita (where Pedro Pascal, Cardi B, and Colombian singer Karol G made cameos) and performing his way through the field, Bad Bunny sang a litany of hits, from “NUEVAYoL” to “Monaco.” He also danced with surprise guest Lady Gaga, who performed “Die With a Smile” during an elaborate wedding scene. (If you're wondering, yes, that couple was real and about to get married. Benito has gotten hundreds of wedding invites from fans over the years, and he wanted to oversee at least one couple's nuptials, Bruce Rodgers says.) He ended by carrying a football through the end zone followed by a parade of people carrying the flags of countries from throughout the Americas while the message “The only thing more powerful than hate is love” lit up the screen behind him.

“It ties together the music and sports aspects,” says Shelley Rodgers. “It's saying, ‘We're all the same, and we're all on this journey together.”

Bob Ross, the effects consultant who orchestrated the pyrotechnic display during the finale, says Sunday's fiery arsenal was the biggest of any Super Bowl halftime show in the past two decades or so. All told, Bad Bunny's set required 9,852 of what Ross calls “theatrical pyrotechnics,” like colored smoke and fireworks. This includes the finale's massive Puerto Rican flags, which lit up the sky as the performers left the field. The point of the big ending was to build on the energy of the music, dancers, and Bad Bunny himself to make something “extremely dynamic,” Ross says. “We're an exclamation mark to a performance.”

For Bruce Rodgers, the institutional knowledge necessary to give artists what they want is hard-won. It all goes back to the first Super Bowl halftime show he ever worked on: Prince. That 2007 performance, which Prince famously performed in the Miami rain, brought the traditional theatrics of a stadium rock show to a football game. As the roster of halftime performers has expanded to include the likes of Rihanna and Lady Gaga, and concert tours have evolved into massive Vegas-style productions, Rodgers has had to push the limits of what can be done on the playing field in 26 minutes, while also managing the dreams of artists about to play for roughly 100 million people worldwide.

Lady Gaga was there.

“We're in a frenzy of a world now show-business-wise, where everybody knows that artists can pull off great things,” Bruce Rodgers says. “It makes our world a little tougher, because we still have seven-and-a-half minutes to get it in, a 12- or 13-minute show, and then six minutes to get it off.”

Not only was Rodgers, who calls Bad Bunny a “sweetheart,” trying to not “squash any dreams” for the show, he and his wife were also working on a much more truncated timeline than in years past. Generally, the artists' concept for the halftime show gets approved around Thanksgiving. Then the team has a couple of months to fabricate, source set pieces, and figure out all the logistics. This time around, it wasn't approved until around the new year—partially because of negotiations between what Bad Bunny was hoping for (those carts full of vegetation) and the solution the Rodgers' provided (hundreds of costumed extras).

“It was very dramatic and intense,” Bruce Rodgers says. But ultimately it made a better show. Nick Pappas, the NFL's field director, says that if you look at the total footprint of the show—carts, stages, costumed humans—”this might be our biggest one yet.”

Bad Bunny's performance comes at a markedly fraught time for America and American sports. When the NFL announced in September that the superstar would be headlining the Super Bowl halftime show, MAGA influencers went on a social media campaign decrying the fact that he “doesn't sing in English.” The artist, who took home three trophies at last weekend's Grammys, has not performed in the continental US as part of his current world tour over fears of ICE raids happening at his concerts. As a longtime supporter of the LGBTQ+ community, there was speculation—and even betting lines—he would wear a dress during Sunday's show. (He clearly didn't.)

A week before the Big Game, Bad Bunny became the first artist to win the Grammy for Album of the Year for an all-Spanish record. Earlier in the night, when DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS won Best Música Urbana Album, he took the stage and said, “Before I say thanks to God, I'm going to say ‘ICE out.' We're not savage; we're not animals; we're not aliens. We are humans and we are Americans.” He got a standing ovation.

A few days after the NFL's announcement last fall, Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem's chief adviser, Corey Lewandowski, went on the conservative podcast The Benny Show to say Game Day attendees could be subject to scrutiny from border patrol agents. “There is nowhere that you can provide safe haven to people who are in this country illegally,” Lewandowski said. “Not the Super Bowl and nowhere else.”

The NFL stuck by its decision to have Bad Bunny headline. “Not everyone has to like everything we do,” the league's chief marketing officer, Tim Ellis, told The Athletic. “Bad Bunny is fucking awesome.”

Months later, the situation has only grown more tense. The Trump administration has beefed up ICE's presence in several US cities, particularly Minneapolis. In January, ICE agents shot and killed US citizens on two separate occasions. Their deaths have sparked demonstrations across the country calling for the end of ICE actions.

On the other side of the world in Italy, as Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo were preparing to host the 2026 Winter Olympics, protesters took to city streets to decry ICE's presence at the Games. US officials claim ICE agents are only in the country to aid in security—not perform immigration operations—but still hundreds of people showed up in Milan's Piazza XXV Aprile on January 31 to demand they leave. Since the Games began, several American Olympic athletes have expressed conflicted feelings about competing for the US.

According to the show's visual effects consultant Bob Ross, Bad Bunny's set required 9,852 of what he calls “theatrical pyrotechnics.”

Many of the pyrotechnics were placed around the perimeter of Levi's Stadium.

Though President Trump attended Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans, he told the New York Post he will not attend this year's game in the San Francisco Bay Area because it's “just too far away.” He was also irked at the inclusion of pregame performers Green Day, claiming the vocally anti-Trump band will “sow hatred.”

Last Monday, Turning Point USA, the right-wing student organization cofounded by the late Charlie Kirk, announced the lineup for its own All-American Halftime Show, headlined by Trump supporter Kid Rock. The organization teased the event for months, billing it as an alternative to Bad Bunny's set. In a press release, Kid Rock said he was approaching the show like David vs. Goliath (he's David in this scenario): “[Bad Bunny] said he's having a dance party, wearing a dress, and singing in Spanish? Cool. We plan to play great songs for folks who love America.”

Whatever backlash the NFL faces for Sunday's performance, the league is poised to come out ahead, says Jared Bahir Browsh, the director of the Critical Sports Studies Program at the University of Colorado Boulder. The league has been growing its international audience of late, and Bad Bunny is a worldwide phenomenon. “As much as we have seen complaints about the conservatism of the NFL, their bottom line is still focused on revenue, and the publicity behind the pick (both good and bad) for Bad Bunny—and to a lesser extent Bay Area locals Green Day—is worth it,” he says.

As folks gathered to watch one of the biggest American sports events on Sunday, excitement for Game Day was mixed with anxiety. To ensure safe viewing, the Working Families Party planned Super Bowl watch events in several US cities, including Los Angeles, Atlanta, Jersey City, Philadelphia, and Columbus, Ohio. “Events like these where fans can safely gather, organize, and celebrate together are becoming more and more vital,” organizers wrote in their announcement of the “Bad Bunny Bowl” watch parties.

On Sunday, there was significant security in place for the game, and there were no reports of ICE immigration activities near Levi's Stadium. Earlier in the week California governor Gavin Newsom said on Thursday that he had been assured there would be “no immigration enforcement tied to the game.”

The goal of Bad Bunny's performance, Shelley Rodgers says, wasn't to be overtly political or to respond directly to the response from the right. “It's more about unity,” she says.

Bruce Rodgers notes that a lot of the statements Bad Bunny wanted to make about inclusiveness around the show were made with the teaser he released last month. “It's a really fucking cool message,” Rodgers says. “I think he knows that people are going to make news out of whatever he does; the illuminati guys on YouTube will make illuminati stories,” so the point was to keep the show's message straightforward. Bad Bunny performed in Spanish. Fans danced. More than 100 million people watched. Then the game resumed, and the internet got flooded with commentary and hot takes.

Prior to the game, pro boxer/influencer Jake Paul posted on X that he was “purposefully turning off the halftime show,” calling Bad Bunny a “fake American citizen … who publicly hates America.” As a Puerto Rican, Bad Bunny is a US citizen. Paul and his brother Logan both have posted videos from their multimillion-dollar homes in Puerto Rico.

President Trump critiqued the halftime show on Truth Social, calling it “absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER.” About Bad Bunny, he posted: “Nobody understands a word this guy is saying.”

Several folks on X seemed to think Bad Bunny's “Ocasio” jersey was for US representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez rather than the artist's last name. Others, meanwhile, noted that Bad Bunny was the only one performing well at the Super Bowl given the relatively low score at halftime (the Patriots ended the half without scoring a single point).

When we spoke before the Super Bowl, Bruce Rodgers brought up Left Shark, the awkward dancer in a shark suit who upstaged Katy Perry during her 2015 performance and became an internet talking point for weeks after. Tribe Inc., of course, also designed that show. He wonders if Sunday's plant costumes will take off in the same way.

“Our team designed Left Shark, but as soon as that thing went viral, Katy Perry said she did it all,” Bruce Rodgers says, somewhat jokingly. “If these costumes are a success, I want my name on 'em, because it was my idea. If they're not a success and a meme, then it was all Shelley's idea. No, I'm kidding.”

A hacktivist has scraped more than half-a-million payment records from a provider of consumer-grade “stalkerware” phone surveillance apps, exposing the email addresses and partial payment information of customers who paid to spy on others. 

The transactions contain records of payments for phone-tracking services like Geofinder and uMobix, as well as services like Peekviewer (formerly Glassagram), which purport to allow access to private Instagram accounts, among several other monitoring and tracking apps provided by the same vendor, a Ukrainian company called Struktura.

The customer data also includes transaction records from Xnspy, a known phone surveillance app, which in 2022 spilled the private data from tens of thousands of unsuspecting people's Android devices and iPhones. 

This is the latest example of a surveillance vendor exposing the information of its customers due to security flaws. Over the past few years, dozens of stalkerware apps have been hacked, or have managed to lose, spill, or expose people's private data — often the victims themselves — thanks to shoddy cybersecurity by the stalkerware operators.

Stalkerware apps like uMobix and Xnspy, once planted on someone's phone, upload the victim's private data, including their call records, text messages, photos, browsing history, and precise location data, which is then shared with the person who planted the app. 

Apps like uMobix and Xnspy have explicitly marketed their services for people to spy on their spouses and domestic partners, which is illegal.

The data, seen by TechCrunch, included about 536,000 lines of customer email addresses, which app or brand the customer paid for, how much they paid, the payment card type (such as Visa or Mastercard), and the last four digits on the card. The customer records did not include dates of payments. 

TechCrunch verified the data was authentic by taking several transaction records containing disposable email addresses with public inboxes, such as Mailinator, and running them through the various password reset portals provided by the various surveillance apps. By resetting the passwords on accounts associated with public email addresses, we determined that these were real accounts.

We also verified the data by matching each transaction's unique invoice number from the leaked dataset with the surveillance vendor's checkout pages. We could do this because the checkout page allowed us to retrieve the same customer and transaction data from the server without needing a password.

The hacktivist, who goes by the moniker “wikkid,” told TechCrunch they scraped the data from the stalkerware vendor thanks to a “trivial” bug in its website. The hacktivist said they “have fun targeting apps that are used to spy on people,” and subsequently published the scraped data on a known hacking forum.

The hacking forum listing lists the surveillance vendor as Ersten Group, which presents itself as a U.K.-presenting software development startup. 

TechCrunch found several email addresses in the dataset used for testing and customer support instead reference Struktura, a Ukrainian company that has an identical website to Ersten Group. The earliest record in the dataset contained the email address for Struktura's chief executive, Viktoriia Zosim, for a transaction of $1. 

Representatives for Ersten Group did not respond to our requests for comment. Struktura's Zosim did not return a request for comment.

But the inward-looking point is correct: git itself is a distributed technology, and development using it is distributed and almost always latency-tolerant.  To the extent that github's customers have processes that are dependent on services like bug tracking and reporting and CI to keep their teams productive, that's a bug with the customer's processes.  It doesn't have to be that way and we as a community can recognize that even if the service provider kinda sucks.

reply

Not on the 2-4 hour latency scale of a GitHub outage though.  I mean, sure, if you have a process that requires the engineering talent to work completely independently on day-plus timescales and/or do all their coordination offline, then you're going to have a ton of trouble staffing[1] that team.But if your folks can't handle talking with the designers over chat or whatnot to backfill the loss of the issue tracker for an afternoon, then that's on you.[1] It can obviously be done!  But it's isomorphic to ""put together a Linux-style development culture"", very non-trivial.

As an alternative, I thought mainly as a secondary repo and ci in case that Github stops being reliable, not only as the current instability, but as an overall provider.

Not who you're responding to, but my 2 cents: for a popular open-source project reliant on community contributions there is really no alternative. It's similar to social media - we all know it's trash and noxious, but if you're any kind of public figure you have to be there.

It has been a pretty smooth process. Although we have done a couple of pieces of custom development:1) We've created a Firecracker-based runner, which will run CI jobs in Firecracker VMs. This brings the Foregjo Actions running experience much more closely into line with GitHub's environment (VM, rather than container). We hope to contribute this back shortly, but also drop me a message if this is of interest.2) We're working up a proposal[1] to add environments and variable groups to Forgejo Actions. This is something we expect to need for some upcoming compliance requirements.I really like Forgejo as a project, and I've found the community to be very welcoming. I'm really hoping to see it grow and flourish :D[0]: https://lithus.eu, adam@[1]: https://codeberg.org/forgejo/discussions/issues/440PS.

One solution I see is (eg) internal forge (Gitlab/gitea/etc) and then mirrored to GH for those secondary features.Which is funny. If GH was better we'd just buy their better plan. But as it stands we buy from elsewhere and just use GH free plans.

Forgejo became a hard fork in 2024, with both projects diverging. If you're using it for local hosting I don't personally see much of a difference between them, although that may change as the two projects evolve.[1] https://forgejo.org/compare-to-gitea/

I doubt policymakers in the early 1900s could have predicted the impact of technology and globalization on the corporate landscape, especially vis a vis “vertical integration”.Personally, I think vertical integration is a pretty big blind spot in laws and policies that are meant to ensure that consumers are not negatively impacted by anticompetitive corporate practices. Sure, “competition” may exist, but the market activity often shifts meaningfully in a direction that is harmful consumers once the biggest players swallow another piece of the supply chain (or product concept), and not just their competitors.

If a company can build a monopoly (or oligopoly) in multiple markets, it can then use these monopolies to build stability for them all. For example, Google uses ads on the Google Search homepage to build a browser near-monopoly and uses Chrome to push people to use Google Search homepage. Both markets have to be attacked simultaneously by competitors to have a fighting chance.

Just when open source development has to deal with the biggest shift in years and maintainers need a tool that will help them fight the AI slop and maintain the software quality, GitHub not only can't keep up with the new requirements, they struggle to keep their product running reliably.Paying customers will start moving off to GitLab and other alternatives, but GitHub is so dominant in open source that maintainers won't move anywhere, they'll just keep burning out more than before.

Elon Musk built SpaceX on his dream of colonizing Mars. For decades, he kept the company on a strict path toward achieving that goal, arguing just last year that using the Moon as a stepping stone to the Red Planet would be a “distraction.” Now, he's singing a very different tune.

In an X post on Sunday, Musk said SpaceX has “shifted focus toward building a self-growing city on the Moon.” Achieving this new goal, he said, will potentially take less than a decade, whereas colonizing Mars would take more than 20 years.

“The mission of SpaceX remains the same: extend consciousness and life as we know it to the stars,” Musk insisted. “That said, SpaceX will also strive to build a Mars city and begin doing so in about 5 to 7 years, but the overriding priority is securing the future of civilization and the Moon is faster.”

For those unaware, SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years. 

The mission of SpaceX remains the same: extend consciousness and life as we know it to…

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 8, 2026



This pivot comes as SpaceX is racing against Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin to deliver a lunar lander for NASA's Artemis 3 mission, which will be the first to land astronauts on the surface of the Moon in over 50 years. NASA awarded SpaceX the contract in 2021, but that never stopped Musk from criticizing the agency's Moon-to-Mars trajectory.

NASA originally planned to launch Artemis 3 in 2024 but has since pushed the mission to 2028, partly due to uncertainty over when a crew lander will be ready. SpaceX's Starship Human Landing System (HLS) has faced significant developmental delays in recent years, prompting the agency to reopen the contract in October. Now, Musk has apparently gotten on board with the whole Moon-to-Mars thing.

Blue Origin has emerged as the top competitor for the contract and is actively prepping its Blue Moon Mark 1 (MK1) cargo lander for its first test flight. MK1 will pave the way for the MK2 crew lander, which could win Blue the Artemis 3 contract if it's ready to fly before the Starship HLS.

The decision to shift SpaceX's guiding mission toward the Moon may be a response to this mounting pressure—at least in part. Blue has also decided to go all-in on the Moon, announcing in late January that it would pause space tourism flights aboard New Shepard for two years to “accelerate development of the company's human lunar capabilities.”

The value of being the first commercial launch provider to land astronauts on the lunar surface clearly isn't lost on either SpaceX or Blue Origin. Whichever company loses this race would have to coordinate with the winner over future landing zones and resource usage and could face diminished support from NASA and investors. Both have sent plans to NASA aimed at achieving a crewed lunar landing before 2030, which is China's target year for its own landing.

At the same time, Musk's ambitious Mars timelines have caught up to him. In 2020, he said he was “highly confident” that SpaceX would land humans on Mars by 2026. The company was planning to send its first uncrewed mission to Mars this year, but Starship V3—the rocket needed to launch it—hasn't even made its debut yet.

Redirecting SpaceX toward building a Moon city would be a clever way to cover up the fact that Musk simply is not delivering on his Red Planet promises. Under this guise, a 2026 Mars mission would appear to fall to the bottom of the priority list rather than succumb to the technical shortcomings of the Starship program.

But this pivot is no mere cover-up. There are real reasons for SpaceX to align its strategic vision with NASA's, especially now that one of its biggest rivals is closer than ever to challenging the company's lunar ambitions.

The U.S. Air Force has banned the use of smart glasses for all its personnel, and it also limited the use of earphones and other Bluetooth devices while in uniform for official duties. According to its dress and personal appearance policy announcement, “It is unauthorized to wear mirrored lenses or smart glasses with photo, video, or artificial intelligence capabilities while in uniform.” Furthermore, the use of earbuds — specifically earpieces, headphones, or any Bluetooth wireless technology — is now limited to personnel who have been authorized for official duties.

The announcement did not give the reason why these gadgets were banned from use while in uniform, except saying that it was “designed to uphold military professionalism” and to support “a more effective and mission-ready force.” However, while not specifically mentioned, there's also the fact that smart glasses often record photos and videos automatically, which are then uploaded to the cloud. This is a nightmare situation for operational security, as it could unintentionally reveal sensitive information, especially for those working at or near top secret bases.

Aside from that, it also prohibited uniformed personnel from using earbuds, both wired and wireless, unless authorized to do so for official duties. The ban even extended to using personal electronic media devices, including earpieces, speaker phones, or text messaging, while walking, unless in an emergency or as part of necessary official notifications. Nevertheless, the regulation introduced a couple of exemptions — uniformed personnel can use them while traveling on public transport or while wearing physical training gear during individual or personnel fitness training.

Public tracking technology has long been a problem for military forces. This first came to light in 2018, when exercise apps, like Strava and Polar, started showing where their users were taking their runs. This unintentionally revealed the location and layout of several U.S. bases — even the secret ones. Even though the users remained anonymous, jogging paths that seemingly appeared out of nowhere indicated that there was an installation there. Matching the publicly available exercise data makes it so much easier to confirm open-source intelligence, increasing the base's operational risks.

Smart glasses are seemingly becoming a significant threat, too, especially as they have become more subtle and sophisticated. For example, Tom's Hardware's review of the Ray-Ban Meta Glasses show that they look like a perfectly normal pair of glasses, but still have the ability to capture what the user sees and hears. And while the Ray-Bans have a white LED light on the frame to indicate that they are recording, some users were able to deactivate it. This meant that they can be used for secretly recording.

This threat also extends beyond bad actors within the U.S. Air Force. The service currently has over 300,000 active-duty personnel — so, even if just 1% of them use smart glasses, that's 3,000 smart devices that need to be monitored and hardened against cyberattacks. So, to make things simple, it just decided to completely ban the smart devices for those in uniform.

After serious injuries, burns, fractures, or major surgeries, the body normally repairs damaged tissues and restores movement. However, in some patients, the healing process takes an unexpected and harmful turn. Instead of rebuilding healthy muscle and tendon, new bone begins to form inside soft tissues, causing pain, stiffness, and long-term disability. This condition, known as heterotopic ossification (HO), often develops after trauma, joint replacement surgery, or combat-related injuries and may require additional surgery. Despite its serious impact on patients' lives, the biological processes behind it have remained poorly understood.

In a new study, a team of researchers led by Dr. Benjamin Levi from Center for Organogenesis, University of Texas Southwestern, United States, revealed how two key proteins, thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) and thrombospondin 2 (TSP2), contribute to abnormal bone growth after injury by reshaping damaged tissue. The findings help explain how injured tissue becomes ""reprogrammed"" to support bone formation and suggest new ways to prevent this serious complication. The study was published in Volume 14 of the journal Bone Research on January 19, 2026.

""Our study shows that these proteins play a central role in shaping the healing environment after injury. When their activity is reduced, abnormal bone growth drops dramatically,"" says Dr. Levi

Previous research suggested that changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM) may influence how tissues heal. However, the molecular signals that guide these changes were unclear. The new study set out to identify the specific factors that shape this healing environment after injury.

To investigate this, the researchers used a well-established mouse model involving burn and tendon injury, a type of trauma known to trigger HO. The team then followed how cells and tissues changed over time using advanced genetic and imaging tools. They combined several techniques, including single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics. In addition, high-resolution imaging was used to analyze collagen fibers and three-dimensional scans to analyze bone formation.

The analyses showed that TSP1 was mainly produced by immune cells known as macrophages at the center of the injury, with lower levels also detected in mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs), early-stage cells that can develop into bone-forming cells. In contrast, TSP2 was produced mainly by MPCs around the edges of the damaged area.

The researchers also found that these proteins influenced how collagen fibers were arranged. In normal healing, collagen is flexible and loosely organized. In injured tissue with active thrombospondin signaling, the fibers became tightly aligned, creating a structure that supported bone growth. To test whether these proteins were essential, the team studied mice that lacked both TSP1 and TSP2. In these animals, collagen fibers were disorganized, and abnormal bone growth was greatly reduced.

""When we removed both proteins, the tissue no longer formed the supportive framework needed for ectopic bone to develop. As a result, we saw much less harmful bone formation,"" says Dr. Levi

Scans confirmed that these mice had far smaller bone deposits in tendons and surrounding tissues, while their normal skeleton remained unaffected. This suggests that targeting these proteins may reduce abnormal bone growth without interfering with healthy bone development.

The study also identified a regulatory protein called FUBP1 that helps control TSP2 production. When FUBP1 levels were reduced in laboratory-grown cells, TSP2 levels also dropped, weakening the signals that promote tissue remodeling. Additionally, the authors caution that their findings are based mainly on animal models. Further research is needed to confirm whether the same mechanisms operate in humans and how safely they can be targeted. Taken together, the study provides insights into how thrombospondin signaling contributes to HO after injury.

""HO can be life-altering for many patients. By understanding the roles of TSP1 and TSP2 in HO formation, we hope to develop therapies that target these proteins and prevent HO before it causes permanent damage,"" concludes Dr. Levi.

In nanoscale particle research, precise control and separation have long been a bottleneck in biotechnology. Researchers at the University of Oulu have now developed a new method that improves particle separation and purification. The promising technique could be applied, for example, in cancer research.

Separating nanosized particles remains a persistent challenge in biotechnology. Once particle size drops below a few hundred nanometres, their behaviour becomes dominated by diffusion – the random walk of particles. This weakens the forces used to guide them, causing separation accuracy to collapse.

A microfluidics research group led by Professor Caglar Elbuken at the University of Oulu has developed a new solution to the problem. The method significantly improves the separation and purification of both small synthetic particles and nanoscale vesicles secreted by living cells.

Particle separation is crucial because many biological processes occur precisely at the nanoscale. Extracellular vesicles isolated from biological samples can reveal early changes in the body. If impurities cannot be removed, valuable information may remain undetected. An efficient yet gentle purification method is therefore essential for both diagnostics and basic research.

In the new method, the researchers combined two physical phenomena: lift generated by electrophoretic slip and the lateral forces that arise in a viscoelastic fluid. In the slip phenomenon, an electric field does not pull the particle directly but sets the surrounding fluid in motion. A viscoelastic fluid behaves partly like a conventional liquid and partly like an elastic material, resulting in lateral forces that do not emerge in water-based solutions.

The study was recently published in the respected journal Analytical Chemistry. The article's lead author, doctoral researcher Seyedamirhosein Abdorahimzadeh from the University of Oulu, explains the significance of the work:

“Controlled separation of nanoparticles is essential in both biological research and many clinical applications, yet existing methods are often slow, complex or unreliable. Our separation and purification method enables surprisingly efficient sorting of particles in an ordinary microchannel. Until now, particles of this size required nanofluidic channels, which clog easily and demand high operating pressures. Compared to earlier techniques, the new method is faster, more accurate and easier to scale.”

The study demonstrated that the method improves the separation and purity of polystyrene particles by roughly 30–50%. Polystyrene particles are commonly used as model particles in research because their size, shape and surface properties can be manufactured with high precision. This makes them ideal test material for various separation techniques, such as those used in microfluidics. The researchers also succeeded in enhancing the purity of vesicles secreted by cancer cells by more than one fifth – a significant improvement at this scale.

According to the researchers, the method could be applied in the future in blood sample analysis, cancer research, studies of cellular communication and nanomedicine more broadly.

The research forms part of Abdorahimzadeh's doctoral thesis, which examines electroviscoelastic and electroinertial methods for controlling and separating micro- and nanoscale particles. He will defend his dissertation on Friday, 13 February 2026, at the University of Oulu.

U.S. men's national team boss Mauricio Pochettino revealed he assured President Donald Trump that the Stars and Stripes can win the 2026 FIFA World Cup, unfolding largely on home soil.

The Argentine manager, who took over the USMNT in September 2024, sat down on the High Performance Podcast and opened up about a brief encounter with President Trump at the 2026 World Cup draw back in December.

“At the draw of the World Cup, I met Donald Trump for a few minutes. He asked me, ‘What do you think, coach. Can you win the World Cup?' ” Pochettino recalled. 

“I said, ‘Of course, Mr President.' Because it's the USA. The American dream is there. It is about being first. Being the number one. We really believe we can win. We are in a place where, after a year and a half, people are starting to feel that we can win.”

The Stars and Stripes received a favorable draw for the competition, matching up against Paraguay, Australia and one of Türkiye, Romania, Slovakia or Kosovo in Group D. With the “massive boost” of the home crowd, Pochettino is confident in his team's chances of making a deep run in the tournament.  

After initial struggles under the new leadership of Pochettino, the USMNT hit its stride to close out 2025. The Stars and Stripes ended the year on a five-game unbeaten run, tallying victories over Japan, Australia, Paraguay and Uruguay. Even more impressive is that the team accomplished the streak without some of its best players.

The opponents waiting for Pochettino's men in March and June, though, present an entirely different challenge. During the March international window, the USMNT is set to face off with Belgium and reigning UEFA Nations League winners Portugal. 

Then in June, the Stars and Stripes' final two matches before the World Cup come against newly crowned AFCON champions Senegal and Germany.  

Going against such top competition will be the real barometer of the USMNT's title credentials. Sure, the team has proven it can defeat Concacaf, CONMEBOL and Oceania opposition, but it will likely need to get past European and African giants if it wants to make history this summer.  

Poor results in the build-up to the tournament could rip up Pochettino's promise to President Trump before the World Cup even begins. A few victories or even hard-fought draws, though, could be the confidence boost the team needs to excel on the grandest stage in the sport, even if they realistically are not ready to defeat the tournament favorites; Spain, Argentina and France.

When Pochettino took charge of the USMNT, he signed a two-year contract that will take him through the 2026 World Cup. Should the Stars and Stripes perform well this summer, U.S. Soccer would likely want to lock down his future.

Yet the 53-year-old teased a potential return to European soccer on the podcast, revealing the trophy he would most like to win is the Champions League. Pochettino quickly added he “doesn't know” for which club.

The desire to hoist the most prestigious trophy in Europe is no surprise considering it alluded him during his time at Spurs, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea. But it also poses the question: Does Pochettino have plans to return to Europe following the World Cup? 

The only person who knows the answer is Pochettino, but the fact that the question even has to be asked paints questions marks around the manager's future with the USMNT. A poor performance at the World Cup on home soil could propel the Argentine back to Europe, leaving the Stars and Stripes once again in another transitional period.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Alexi Lalas pours cold water on Noahkai Banks' USMNT World Cup hopes","https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/usmnt/2026/02/09/alexi-lalas-on-noahkai-banks-usmnt-world-cup-hopes/88591776007/","Mon, 09 Feb 2026 19:08:00 GMT","

Noahkai Banks may be making a big impression in the Bundesliga this season, but the young defender won't be making a trip to the World Cup this summer, according to Alexi Lalas.

Banks has become a regular starter this season for Augsburg at age 19. The 6-foot-4 defender is considered one of the best American defensive prospects in many years and has earned one U.S. men's national team call-up.

""I saw him playing in Germany, and he's a massive talent,"" USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino said after naming Banks to his roster for September friendlies against South Korea and Japan.

""You never know how he can explode — maybe at the end of the season he can be the best center back in Europe or in Germany.""

Banks did not participate in either match and wasn't called up for the USMNT's remaining four matches last fall.

That lack of experience may end up proving costly for Banks' World Cup hopes. As the USMNT prepares for two final matches in March before the World Cup roster is named, Lalas thinks it may already be too late for the talented teenager.

""Mauricio Pochettino just recently said that we are going to treat the March window as if it's the start of the World Cup,"" Lalas said on his ""State of the Union"" show.

""So we're going to start the World Cup with somebody that doesn't have a single minute playing for the U.S. men's national team? I don't think that's off base for me to be wary of that, or me to be skeptical of that actually happening.""

Lalas was responding to co-host Stu Holden, who tipped Banks for a potential World Cup spot.

""He has great size,"" the former USMNT midfielder said. ""I know he's 19 years old, but his experience that he's picking up right now, it's such a high level. He has a lot of tools that I don't see anywhere else in the center back pool.""

But Lalas said the March games against Belgium and Portugal won't be the time for experimenting.

""According to Pochettino, it's as if the World Cup just started,"" he said. ""So I want the best 11 playing in whatever formation it is that you believe we are going to play in the World Cup.

""And so I don't understand what leads Stu or others to believe that Pochettino is going to have this player that nobody has seen actually play for the U.S. before not only be there, but in many cases start.""

Lalas added: ""I'm excited about Noahkai Banks, don't get me wrong. ... Starting consistently over there for a young player is a good thing for the future.""","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

Foxborough vs. FIFA and the Kraft Group is underway.

The Town of Foxborough reaffirmed Monday morning that it is not going to front the $7.8 million it will cost to provide necessary safety and security measures for the seven World Cup games coming to Kraft family-owned Gillette Stadium this summer.

“We've spent the last year planning for the security and safety of the stadium and the event, but the issue comes down to one of the town not being responsible for the costs associated with that security — it really falls to either the Kraft Sports and Entertainment Group or FIFA to cover those costs,” said Bill Yukna, chair of the town's select board.  

Yukna said the town was supposed to learn on Jan. 30 about its grant request but is still waiting.

FEATURED VIDEO

The hammer Foxborough holds over FIFA and the Kraft Group is the granting of an entertainment license that will allow the games to be held in the Patriots' and Revolution's home stadium, which is to be known as “Boston Stadium” during the event.

Because the Kraft Group is subletting the venue to FIFA, the existing entertainment license does not cover this summer's tournament and a new one is required, said Yukna.

The town has set a March 17 deadline to receive its full security request before granting a license.

“Our issue quite honestly is grants don't really work for us in the sense of timing,” said Yukna. “We obviously would have to pay all the officers and any of the [new capital] purchases before the grant would reimburse us.”

Yukna said the town is not allowed to discuss specific security measures and requirements from FIFA and security partners the town is working with, other than to say they are “enhanced” needs and are not used for standard security operations for sports events and concerts.

“We told them that if we don't have a completed lease resolved and signatures on both sides by March 17, then the town will not issue a license,” said Yukna.

The end of the town's fiscal year falls on June 30, the day after the sixth match and nine days before the seventh.  

In a statement sent to the Globe, the town reiterated that the World Cup is not an event that its taxpayers can subsidize.

“Foxborough supports the World Cup and wants to be a successful host community,” read the statement in part. “However, the taxpayers of Foxborough cannot and will not be responsible for funding an international sporting event. We believe it is reasonable and appropriate that FIFA and/or event partners provide the funding necessary to support the public safety and operational requirements that come with hosting these matches.”

The town's 2026 fiscal year operating budget is $102,338,412, with $13 million budgeted for public safety.

The funds from the $47 million federal grant earmarked to Massachusetts for World Cup security matters exceeds the 2026 total outlay of $6.4 million for its police department.

FIFA, soccer's governing body, estimates revenues from the expanded 48-country event to be held in 16 North American cities will top $11 billion.

FIFA reported $4.76 billion in assets at the end of 2024, when it generated $483 million in revenues.

Based on FIFA's revised 2024 budget, its expenses and investments this year will total close to $6.4 billion.

Last year, CNBC ranked the Kraft Group as the eighth-most-valuable sports conglomerate, worth an estimated $11 billion.

The Boston 26 committee charged with staging the event is a nonprofit that does not receive funding from FIFA. Its approximately $100 million budget is funded through state, federal, and private investments.

Foxborough and Boston are expected to apply for and receive a large portion of the $47 million allocated to Massachusetts. The grant approval process is complex, involving first the state and then federal review, which is handled through FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security, which makes the final funding decisions.

The Globe reached out to FIFA for comment and was told to redirect inquiries to the Boston host committee, which did not immediately respond. Last Friday, the committee conveyed in a statement that it was “working closely with FIFA, the stadium, and the Town of Foxborough to reach an agreement.”

Foxborough's statement said that it is working “collaboratively with FIFA, Boston Soccer, Kraft Sports and Entertainment, the Commonwealth, and our public safety partners to prepare for the 2026 FIFA World Cup” and that the games represent an “exciting opportunity for the region.

“At the same time, hosting an event of this scale creates significant public safety, operational, and infrastructure demands on the host community. Our police, fire, emergency communications, public works, and municipal staff will be responsible for ensuring the safety of tens of thousands of visitors while also maintaining essential services for our residents and businesses.”

The town has spent many months working with event organizers and public safety professionals to identify the resources required to host these matches. Those efforts have made clear that the associated municipal costs are substantial.

 

The town emphasized that it is working toward a solution: “Our goal is to ensure that the event is safe, well managed, and successful for visitors, the region, and most importantly, the residents and businesses of Foxborough.”  

Last Friday, a spokesperson for Governor Maura Healey said, in part: “We are committed to ensuring that municipalities, especially Foxborough, have the support they need to make this a successful event through state, federal, and private funds.”

The less said about last night's game, the better? After a season that exceeded almost everyone's expectations, the Patriots lost Super Bowl 60 to the Seattle Seahawks by a score of 29-13. Drake Maye and the Pats' offense struggled to get anything going against Seattle's relentless defense. ""I'd like to go back to the beginning and redo it,"" Maye said after the game, adding that the tough loss will be motivation for next year.

""The biggest thing about life is you're going to have times like this, and it's how you bounce back,"" said the 23-year-old, who got emotional at times during the post-game press conference as he reflected on the loss and the season as a whole.

In between the action, Bad Bunny's much-anticipated halftime show was a festive homage to Puerto Rico — with nearly as many celebrity cameos as Dunkin's ""Good Will Hunting"" parody commercial. (You can watch the performance in full here.)

Now, to the news:

Meanwhile back in Foxborough: Just over four months from the start of the World Cup, town officials in Foxborough are threatening to withhold a necessary entertainment license for matches at Gillette Stadium — unless they get their money first. During a meeting last week, Foxborough Select Board Chair Bill Yukna said they've requested $7.7 million to pay for local security costs, and they want it all upfront before they grant the license. ""This event is not Foxborough's event,"" Yukna said. ""This is a national — international — event, and it's not up to the town of Foxborough to support or pay for any of this.""

In other local news: The Pentagon is cutting ties with Harvard University, as the Trump administration's ongoing standoff with the university continues.

On the T: The Green Line has resumed normal service this morning after a trolley derailed yesterday afternoon at Park Street and ripped up a bit of the platform.  Service between Park Street and Government Center was suspended until late last night due inspections and repairs, according to the MBTA.

                        With the FIFA World Cup expected to bring a surge of tourists to Philly, the restaurant and bar industry wants Pennsylvania to extend last call beyond 2 a.m. Above, a countdown clock to the World Cup at Dilworth Park in Center City. 
                    

More than 500,000 tourists are expected to visit Pennsylvania when the World Cup comes to Philly for a three-week stretch this summer.

The bar and restaurant industry sees this as a golden opportunity for Philly's nightlife to capitalize on a swell of soccer fans and others coming to town to mark the United States' 250th anniversary. Bars want the option stay open past the state's 2 a.m. curfew for serving alcohol. 

""We want to make sure that Philly is competitive with the other host cities,"" said Ben Fileccia, senior vice president of strategy and engagement at the Pennsylvania Restaurant and Lodging Association, a trade group based in Harrisburg. ""We know people are going to be coming from all over the world, and their drinking schedule doesn't necessarily stop at 2 a.m. I would much prefer that liquor is being sold and provided by businesses that do this on a regular basis and know how to protect their guests.""

Lincoln Financial Field is hosting six World Cup matches, including one on the Fourth of July. The international soccer tournament is at the heart of a packed summer schedule that has made Philadelphia a global travel destination in 2026. The Philadelphia Convention & Visitors Bureau estimates more than 1 million international travelers will be in town this year. 

""We're going to be hosting a huge crowd, anyway,"" Fileccia said. ""We would rather capture that extra revenue and help our restaurants and our liquor licensees. It will also drive more tax revenue to the city and state.""

Other World Cup host cities, like New York and Miami, allow alcohol service until 4 a.m. or later. Kansas City is hosting six matches this summer, and lawmakers in Missouri recently passed legislation allowing bars and restaurants to stay open up to 23 hours straight during the World Cup. Kansas lawmakers are considering a similar bill. 

Any temporary changes to Philly's bar curfew would need to be authorized by a state law. The bill would need to spell out how and when the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board should administer permits for businesses that want to adjust their hours. 

The city is interested in entertaining ways to grant bars more leeway to take advantage of the tourism boom. 

""Exploring extended business hours is one of many economic strategies that is being discussed as cities around the country prepare to host large-scale global events in 2026 and beyond,"" Karen Fegely, acting director of the Philadelphia Department of Commerce, said in a statement. ""... If the State advances legislation, the City is ready to engage and partner to ensure any policy is thoughtful, and centered on public safety, neighborhood quality of life, and economic benefit for all.""

The last time Philly was granted a window to extend its bar curfew happened during the Democratic National Convention in 2016. Less than two weeks before the political convention that July, the state passed a law narrowly defining how Philly bars could participate during a period of about a week.

PLCB accepted applications for a $5,000 ""national event permit"" allowing approved businesses to stay open until 4 a.m., but only if they hosted events sanctioned by the DNC. The response was underwhelming, partly because of the time crunch and confusion about the rules. 

Thirty bars ended up with permits, including Center City sports bar Ladder 15 and Gayborhood hotspot Woody's. More than half of the participating bars were at hotels, and applications from 17 other businesses were denied. 

The PLCB is required to follow strict rules in any laws granting time-limited changes to the liquor code, spokesperson Shawn Kelly said. Many questions will need to be answered in Harrisburg, including how many bars could stay open late, whether the extended curfew would be restricted to certain neighborhoods and if there would be a cost to participate.

""If and when the law is changed, PLCB will respond accordingly,"" he said. 

Zakary Pyzik, leader of the restaurant and lodging association's public affairs efforts in Harrisburg, said there has been ""enthusiastic"" support from a handful of state lawmakers based in Philly. Several of them, including Democrats and Republicans, declined to comment on plans to introduce legislation concerning bar hours this summer, or answer questions about the potential scope of extended service. 

At a minimum, PRLA wants bars to have the option to stay open past 2 a.m. for the entirety of the World Cup — a 39-day stretch from June 11 to July 19. 

""We want operators and owners of all restaurants and bars of different sizes, ranging from small mom-and-pops to bigger chains and even beyond that, to have the opportunity to get involved if they want to,"" Pyzik said. ""It would be different for everybody. There are a lot of questions operators would have to ask if they do get involved. They'll want to make sure they can do it responsibly and safely.""

Philadelphia Soccer 2026, FIFA's World Cup host committee for the city, did not respond when asked whether it has been involved in discussions about extended bar service or if it would partner with businesses for late-night events should a law get passed. 

Of the six World Cup matches scheduled in Philly, the latest start time is the 9 p.m. group stage contest between Brazil and Haiti on Friday, June 19. Another group stage match between Ivory Coast and Ecuador on June 14 starts at 7 p.m. All of the other matches have 4 p.m. or 5 p.m. start times. 

Group stage games last about two hours. Knockout round games could be three hours long if they end on penalty kicks.

How much demand there will be for World Cup-related nightlife past 2 a.m. in Philly is difficult to predict. FIFA says its match times are optimized to enable the ""widest-possible global audience"" to follow the tournament. Several matches, all broadcast on FOX-owned networks, are scheduled to begin as late as midnight on the East Coast.

Philadelphia Soccer 2026, which will hold the free FIFA FanFest at Fairmount Park's Lemon Hill for the duration of the World Cup, has not yet revealed its daily hours of operation. Watch parties at the festival are expected to draw as many as 25,000 people each day, and they may want to keep festivities going afterward, including at hotels contracted for the 39-day event. 

""I think there's a lot of different restaurants and bars in Philly that not only already operate with significant late-night demand, but would welcome the opportunity to explore extended hours,"" Pyzik said. 

The Pennsylvania Licensed Beverage & Tavern Association, another trade group in Harrisburg, is ""supportive"" of legislation to extend service hours but has some doubts about how successful it would be with businesses and customers. 

""Part of the problem with the 4 a.m. concept will be getting employees to work that late,"" Executive Director Chuck Moran said. ""The second issue with the 4 a.m. concept will be that the late-night bar crowds have disappeared. At least that's what bar owners tell me across the state. So I'm not sure how popular it would be with bar owners. Nonetheless, it would be worth giving bar owners that option.""

Moran said he expects lawmakers to address a range of regulatory issues for bars statewide this year due to the boost in tourism and major events. He noted the NFL Draft coming to Pittsburgh and the MLB All-Star Game in Philly as occasions that merit flexibility for venues that serve alcohol.

""It's a much bigger issue that goes beyond the World Cup,"" he said. 

Pyzik said he's hopeful state lawmakers will get on board with a sensible plan to make Philadelphia an attractive nightlife destination for World Cup travelers, but he expects it will be a battle that's going to take bipartisan leadership. 

""Obviously, they've got divided government up (in Harrisburg) and it's an election year, so you've got partisan politics that will be on full display,"" he said. ""We're mindful of the fact that even bridge naming resolutions in Harrisburg right now are uphill battles.""

U.S. men's national team boss Mauricio Pochettino revealed he assured President Donald Trump that the Stars and Stripes can win the 2026 FIFA World Cup, unfolding largely on home soil.

The Argentine manager, who took over the USMNT in September 2024, sat down on the High Performance Podcast and opened up about a brief encounter with President Trump at the 2026 World Cup draw back in December.

“At the draw of the World Cup, I met Donald Trump for a few minutes. He asked me, ‘What do you think, coach. Can you win the World Cup?' ” Pochettino recalled. 

“I said, ‘Of course, Mr President.' Because it's the USA. The American dream is there. It is about being first. Being the number one. We really believe we can win. We are in a place where, after a year and a half, people are starting to feel that we can win.”

The Stars and Stripes received a favorable draw for the competition, matching up against Paraguay, Australia and one of Türkiye, Romania, Slovakia or Kosovo in Group D. With the “massive boost” of the home crowd, Pochettino is confident in his team's chances of making a deep run in the tournament.  

After initial struggles under the new leadership of Pochettino, the USMNT hit its stride to close out 2025. The Stars and Stripes ended the year on a five-game unbeaten run, tallying victories over Japan, Australia, Paraguay and Uruguay. Even more impressive is that the team accomplished the streak without some of its best players.

The opponents waiting for Pochettino's men in March and June, though, present an entirely different challenge. During the March international window, the USMNT is set to face off with Belgium and reigning UEFA Nations League winners Portugal. 

Then in June, the Stars and Stripes' final two matches before the World Cup come against newly crowned AFCON champions Senegal and Germany.  

Going against such top competition will be the real barometer of the USMNT's title credentials. Sure, the team has proven it can defeat Concacaf, CONMEBOL and Oceania opposition, but it will likely need to get past European and African giants if it wants to make history this summer.  

Poor results in the build-up to the tournament could rip up Pochettino's promise to President Trump before the World Cup even begins. A few victories or even hard-fought draws, though, could be the confidence boost the team needs to excel on the grandest stage in the sport, even if they realistically are not ready to defeat the tournament favorites; Spain, Argentina and France.

When Pochettino took charge of the USMNT, he signed a two-year contract that will take him through the 2026 World Cup. Should the Stars and Stripes perform well this summer, U.S. Soccer would likely want to lock down his future.

Yet the 53-year-old teased a potential return to European soccer on the podcast, revealing the trophy he would most like to win is the Champions League. Pochettino quickly added he “doesn't know” for which club.

The desire to hoist the most prestigious trophy in Europe is no surprise considering it alluded him during his time at Spurs, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea. But it also poses the question: Does Pochettino have plans to return to Europe following the World Cup? 

The only person who knows the answer is Pochettino, but the fact that the question even has to be asked paints questions marks around the manager's future with the USMNT. A poor performance at the World Cup on home soil could propel the Argentine back to Europe, leaving the Stars and Stripes once again in another transitional period.

SAN FRANCISCO — With a Super Bowl in the books and the FIFA men's World Cup around the corner, the Bay Area Host Committee has already set its aim on the next marquee sporting event it wants to bring to the region.

As part of the U.S. bid for the 2031 Women's World Cup, the Bay Area submitted Levi's Stadium and Oracle Park as potential venues. FIFA officials were in town this week for the Super Bowl, and host committee CEO Zaileen Janmohamed said she was “hopeful” about the region's chances.

“Personally, I want to bring a women's event here — that would be really meaningful to me,” Janmohamed said after Monday morning's news conference passing the Super Bowl torch to next year's host, Los Angeles. “We'll see how that goes, but we saw what happened this week when an event comes into this market. This place is awesome in hosting an event.”

NFL commissioner Roger Goodell echoed the sentiment, calling the Bay Area a “very special place” and saying that the league “could not have had a better week.” While Super Bowl 60 took place Sunday at Levi's Stadium, events throughout the week were spread between San Francisco, the East Bay and Silicon Valley.

“The innovation, the strength that you all have, the diversity, the creativity, the can-do atmosphere showed itself incredibly well this week,” Goodell said, crediting the mayors of San Jose and San Francisco, 49ers executives Jed York and Al Guido, as well as Janmohamed. “She just pulled it all together. This is a very complicated event, and she did it. So we are eternally grateful to her.”

According to York, the 49ers' CEO, the Super Bowl generated “about $500 million” in economic impact around the region and brought in visitors who accounted for more than 100,000 room nights in local hotels. The 49ers also donated close to $10 million into the community this week, York said.

“If we can't host a Super Bowl next year, we might as well keep it on the best coast,” York said. “The season starts today. The Niners are ready to get after it. Hopefully we'll be there.”

With Super Bowl 61 coming to Los Angeles, it will mark the fourth time in NFL history that separate cities in the same state have hosted the game in consecutive years. The Men's World Cup will also play matches at two venues in California, and Los Angeles is set to host the Summer Olympics in 2028.

“We know there is a lot of misinformation out there about our state,” Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis said. “But what we know is that there is a reason why we have two back-to-back Super Bowls. … Because California has the people, the cities, the sports teams, the sports fans, the incredible infrastructure, the hotels and the ability to continue to invest in all these things as the fourth-largest economy in the world.”

Janmohamed intends to keep the Bay Area as a prominent player for big events. When the Men's World Cup arrives in June, with six matches at Levi's Stadium, it will become the first time a venue has hosted a Super Bowl and the World Cup in the same calendar year.

“We're going to take a couple days to regroup; otherwise my team is going to fall over,” Janmohamed said. “Close some things off with the NFL, make sure we transition really well, and by next week, we'll be back at it and starting to go full-steam ahead on the World Cup.”

Janmohamed said she met with FIFA officials on Saturday.

The U.S., along with proposed co-hosts Mexico, Costa Rica and Jamaica, was the sole bid for the 2031 Women's World Cup when FIFA released proposals in November. A formal announcement awarding the tournament is expected in April, with cities and venues announced after that.

“I think what FIFA wants to make sure of is that the Women's World Cup isn't necessarily just a replication of the Men's World Cup,” Janmohamed said. “There's different cities in the country that might not have been considered for a Men's World Cup. San Diego is a great example. So I actually have no idea how it's going to play out. Obviously, the Bay is an important market for them. They have a lot of sponsors that are based out here. So I'm hopeful.”

Academics from the University of Sheffield are warning that current gambling advertising rules may be insufficient after new research revealed that television gambling ads significantly influenced betting activity during the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The study examined betting behavior among men aged 18–45 in England during the tournament in Qatar, to see how exposure to gambling advertising on television influenced the likelihood of placing bets.

The findings, published in Addictive Behaviors Reports, show that the frequency of football betting was between 16% and 24% higher during matches broadcast on channels carrying gambling advertising, compared with games shown on channels without such ads. Participants were also between 22% to 33% more likely to place a bet during matches that included television gambling advertising.

Although participants reported no personal history of gambling problems, men and individuals aged 18–44 are known to disproportionately make up the largest group of sports bettors in the U.K. and are also at the greatest risk of gambling-related harm.

Sports betting, particularly football, remains one of the most common forms of gambling in Great Britain, with the rapid growth of in-play and micro-betting intensifying both the speed and frequency of opportunities to place bets.

Gambling is widely recognized as a public health issue, with associated health, social and economic costs in England alone estimated at between £1.05 and £1.77 billion per year.

As the U.K. approaches the 2026 World Cup, the rules governing the timing of gambling advertisements on television remain unchanged since 2022. Existing restrictions are largely voluntary and industry led, raising fresh concerns about whether current rules are sufficient to protect viewers.

Lead author of the study, Ellen McGrane, Research Associate at the University of Sheffield's School of Medicine and Population health, said, ""These television ads may be acting as powerful triggers during live games, encouraging betting even among people who had no prior intention to gamble.

""One of our key findings was that this advertising doesn't simply shift people between betting platforms, it increases the overall amount of gambling taking place. A substantial body of evidence shows that when gambling participation rises at a population level, gambling-related harm also increases, suggesting that the current restrictions in place may not be effective enough.

""Despite the scale of this issue, advertising rules are not being strengthened. Tighter regulation of gambling advertising during live sport may be needed, particularly ahead of highly televised events such as the World Cup, to better protect those most at risk.""

Recent reviews of gambling law in the U.K. have introduced measures such as adjustments to gambling taxation, a new compulsory industry levy to fund prevention, research and treatment, and limits on stakes for certain gambling products. However, no changes have been made to gambling advertising regulations.

The research points to approaches already in place in several European countries, where policies restrict gambling advertising around live football broadcasts, as potential models for reform.

Portugal superstar ready to end strike as Al-Nassr pencil in comeback date","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/cristiano-ronaldo-to-return-portugal-superstar-ready-to-end-strike-as-al-nassr-pencil-in-return-date/blt51ce6b772e8bc203","Mon, 09 Feb 2026 16:30:00 GMT","

Cristiano Ronaldo is reportedly ready to end his strike at Al-Nassr as he prepares to return for the Saudi Arabian club. The former Real Madrid and Manchester United superstar had refused to play for his side in protest at their transfer dealings in January, missing the team's last two matches, but Al-Nassr have now pencilled in the date for their superstar's return.

Per A Bola, Ronaldo is already back in training with Al-Nassr after missing their last two fixtures in protest at their January transfer dealings. Nassr have now pencilled in his return date, against Al-Fateh next weekend. Nassr play Arkadag in Turkmenistan in the Asian Champions League 2 in midweek, but Ronaldo is not set to play in that fixture. 

Reports suggested Ronaldo was affronted by Nassr's lack of activity in the winter window, as they only signed a youth player, while title rivals Al-Hilal were allowed to sign Karim Benzema from Al-Ittihad. PIF owns all three clubs, and Ronaldo was left furious, though A Bola also claims he was angry about payments to workers at Nassr being delayed. Now, Nassr are said to have agreed to pay up, with the power struggle ending with a victory for the forward.

Ronaldo has reportedly threatened to leave Nassr but it is unclear if new political machinations behind the scenes will convince him to stay. A Bola report that two Portuguese executives, Jose Semedo and Simao Coutinho, had seen their powers reduced ahead of the transfer window, impacting their ability to sign new players, but those responsibilities are now said to have been returned to them. 

Saudi Pro League bosses have taken to reminding Ronaldo that every club in their division operates independently, meaning that the all-time great should raise any issues with his own employers - rather than potentially damage the reputation of the league as a whole.

“The Saudi Pro League is structured around a simple principle: every club operates independently under the same rules,"" they said in a statement.

“Clubs have their own boards, their own executives and their own football leadership. Decisions on recruitment, spending and strategy sit with those clubs, within a financial framework designed to ensure sustainability and competitive balance. That framework applies equally across the league.

“Cristiano has been fully engaged with Al Nassr since his arrival and has played an important role in the club's growth and ambition. Like any elite competitor, he wants to win. But no individual - however significant - determines decisions beyond their own club.

“Recent transfer activity demonstrates that independence clearly. One club strengthened in a particular way. Another chose a different approach. Those were club decisions, taken within approved financial parameters.

“The competitiveness of the league speaks for itself. With only a few points separating the top four, the title race is very much alive. That level of balance reflects a system that is working as intended.

“The focus remains on football - on the pitch, where it belongs - and on maintaining a credible, competitive competition for players and fans.”

Ronaldo's strike has not gone down particularly well with onlookers at home and abroad, with Premier League legend Alan Shearer shocked by his behaviour. 

The league's all-time leading goalscorer said: “There's not many people on over £400,000 a day and go on strike. It must be a nice position to be in to say I'm not coming to work despite being on that amount of money. It's bizarre when you think about it. He's a superstar but going on strike at that level doesn't look good.”

Al-Nassr are currently second in the SPL table, and are just one point behind Al-Hilal, even though their title rivals have yet to lose this season. Ronaldo has yet to win the biggest prize in Saudi and is continuing his quest to do so, ahead of the 2026 World Cup this summer. He will, of course, want to be in the best possible shape for that tournament. ","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Promises are hard to keep, but one Manchester United fan has held up his end of a viral bargain for well over a year and he is in it for the long haul, for better or worse...

By now, you've probably heard about the hapless Manchester United fan who vowed never to cut his hair until the Red Devils won five games in a row.

He certainly couldn't have imagined the impact his promise would have on football fan culture, or, indeed, the trajectory of his life, with millions of people now following him on social media and the biggest names in the sport fully aware of who he is.

Here is everything you need to know about The United Strand - one fan's hairy viral journey to football notoriety:

The United Strand is the name of an online sensation that came to life following a public declaration issued by long-suffering Manchester United fan Frank Ilett.

Growing frustrated with the on-field inconsistency of his beloved Red Devils, Mr Ilett vowed in October 2024 that he would not cut his hair until they won five games in a row. Little did he - or,  indeed, those who follow him - realise that he would still be bound by that solemn declaration 16 months later.

Ilett's ever-expanding afro soon became a running gag among football fans as a hirsute barometer of United's inconsistency, with various national and international news outlets acknowledging the effect his viral pact was having on football fan culture.

""It just started as a bit of fun, really,"" Illett told Sky Sports. ""I thought it would be a fun thing to do, to bring some humour into what was a painful time for Manchester United fans.""

Unfortunately for Ilett, however, not everyone has seen the funny side and he was actually assaulted by another supporter while attending United's 2-1 victory against Chelsea at Old Trafford in September 2025.

""My intention was never to highlight the flaws of Man United, but to spread positivity and humour,"" Ilett has insisted.

The United Strand hair cut challenge officially began on October 5, 2024.

That means that Ilett's hair has been draped across the tenures of three different Manchester United managers so far (Erik ten Hag, Ruben Amorim and now Michael Carrick).

As of publication on February 9, 2026, the hair challenge has been going for 492 days - that's one year, four months and seven days.

A very good question. In simple terms, the challenge will be complete as soon as Manchester United win five games in a row. 

Following their victory over Tottenham on February 7, the team's fourth win in a row, there is a possibility that Ilett's hairy nightmare will be over should the Red Devils win their next match against West Ham on Tuesday, February 10, 2026.

Indeed, plans have been confirmed for a 'watchalong' video and Ilett appears to be relieved that the end is potentially near, saying: ""Carrick is at the wheel, this hair is going soon, West Ham next, four out of five done – this is the first time it's been four in a row since I started the challenge. This time it's happening! Thank you so much to Carrick – thank you, thank you, thank you.""

For those so inclined, Manchester United's game against West Ham is being broadcast live on TNT Sports 1 and TNT Sports Ultimate in the United Kingdom, while fans in the United States can watch the game live on Peacock.

As much as Aston Villa fans mocked The United Strand as the Villans notched 11 successive victories during the 2025-26 season, winning five games in a row is a tough task for even the best teams, especially in an elite-level league such as the Premier League. 

You have to go back to February 2024 for the last time Manchester United managed a five-game winning streak.

The five-game run began with a win over Newport County in the FA Cup, which was followed by victories against Wolves, West Ham, Aston Villa and Luton Town.

Mikel Merino has undergone surgery on the foot injury that he suffered at the end of Arsenal's 3-2 defeat to Manchester United. The Spain international could well return before the end of the season, but he faces a race against time to feature in the conclusion of what could be an immensely tight title race. Arsenal currently top the table and are six points clear of Manchester City.

Per Football.London, Merino underwent surgery on the foot injury sustained against United and he now faces a race against time to return before the end of the campaign. The 29-year-old has scored four goals and registered three assists thus far this season but he is now set to spend the next eight weeks unable to put serious weight on the affected foot. He can still work in the gym, and there is an optimism he will be able to return before the end of the season, as the Gunners look to win their first Premier League title since 2004. 

Arteta has said on Merino potentially coming back this term: “Well, we hope so. I don't know. Obviously, he needs to go through a procedure, which is never always positive. He's a big player for us.

“An athlete that has such a versatility and capacity to compete in various positions. Yeah, that's a big blow.”

Merino has fractured his foot, and Arteta claims the extent of the injury is ""rare"". 

He added:  “Let's see. It's a very rare injury, so we have to wait and see once we have the surgery. How that reacts daily.

“Obviously, monitor it throughout the week for the surgery. I know Mikel is going to do absolutely everything that he possibly can to come back as quick as possible.

“But, as well, he has to respect the healing process and the fact that, obviously, it's an injury that is quite rare.”

Merino will also hope to return before the end of the season as he aims to represent Spain at the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Mexico, and Canada.

It is a blow for a player who was revelling in his side's fine form earlier this term, telling the club's website: ""Obviously, football is not only about results. It's the main thing, but when you can enjoy playing with these teammates, it's just a joy, and I'm enjoying it every time I'm on the pitch.

""I think everyone is giving their best and enjoying as well, and that's the best mix we can have, so performing and enjoying is the magic recipe, so yeah, very happy.""

Merino was signed as a midfielder but has developed into a real option for the Gunners up front, with Arteta marvelling at his versatility. 

He added: “Yes, as a striker certainly not [something he ever dreamt he could do] but that's the thing as well that you learn when you sign a player – I knew he could offer much more than what he had, and especially after I met him for the first time because a player that has that amount of curiosity, the way he loves his profession and football, it's difficult to put limits to that.”

The Gunners currently sit six points clear of Manchester City at the top of the league but, along with Merino, are without Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard amid a rash of injury issues this term.

Arteta's side play Brentford in a tricky looking away trip in midweek. The Bees currently sit seventh in the Premier League table and are only five points behind fourth-placed Manchester United, with potential ambitions of qualifying for the Champions League. Arsenal will then take a break from their nerve-jangling title race, as they take on Wigan Athletic in the fourth round of the FA Cup.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","USWNT Abroad: Alyssa Thompson boosts Chelsea back to winning ways as Emily Fox and Arsenal ruin Sam Coffey and Man City's 13-match run","https://www.goal.com/en-au/lists/uswnt-abroad-alyssa-thompson-boosts-chelsea-emily-fox-arsenal-sam-coffey-man-city/blt1f6d9218bf941e09","Mon, 09 Feb 2026 19:04:54 GMT","

GOAL breaks down the key moments from USWNT players abroad, including Thompson getting back in form. 

Manchester United Women's quiet climb toward the top of the Women's Super League continued this weekend with a tidy 2-0 win over Leicester, but once again it was USWNT goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce who stole the spotlight. The shot-stopper made six saves to secure another clean sheet and underline her growing importance for the Reds.

Across Manchester, Sam Coffey earned more league minutes off the bench for Manchester City, though the Blues suffered a rare defeat at the hands of Arsenal. While the result itself was headline-worthy, Coffey's increased involvement stood out, as her developing chemistry alongside Yui Hasegawa added a new American dimension to City's midfield.

In west London, Alyssa Thompson continued her breakout WSL campaign, scoring in Chelsea's 2-0 rebound win over Tottenham to keep her scoring streak alive. And while Chelsea rediscovered their footing, Emily Fox and Arsenal set the weekend's tone, handing Manchester City a surprising loss. Fox delivered a composed defensive performance, helping keep the Sky Blues off the scoresheet.

From highlight-reel saves to goals, growing roles, and statement results, it was a weekend that showcased the expanding impact of USWNT players across the WSL. GOAL takes a closer look at how USWNT players fared across Europe over the weekend.

Thompson was on the scoresheet again as Chelsea earned a weekend win, adding to what has been a productive WSL campaign for the American attacker. Across all competitions for Chelsea, Thompson now has eight goals to her name. 

The goal against Tottenham marked her sixth league goal of the season, continuing a run of consistent output in the final third. Thompson's movement and finishing have made her a regular difference-maker for the Blues, and her ability to convert chances in tight matches is becoming a defining part of her impact in England.

Arsenal's statement win over Manchester City came with plenty of talking points, and Fox was quietly central to the result and all of the points.

Tasked with managing one of the league's most dangerous attacks, from Khadija Shaw to Kerolin,Fox delivered a composed, disciplined performance on the outside back spot. She managed to limit City's space in transition, and picked her moments to get forward without leaving Arsenal exposed. It was the kind of performance that doesn't always dominate highlight reels but absolutely shapes outcomes - a reminder of why Fox has become such a trusted presence in Arsenal's back line.

If Manchester United's push near the top of the table is going to hold, Tullis-Joyce is making a strong case that she'll be one of the main reasons why. The American goalkeeper delivered another assured performance in United's weekend victory over Leicester City, producing six saves to preserve a clean sheet and reinforce the defensive confidence in her backline. 

Tullis-Joyce's command of the box, shot-stopping ability, and growing composure under pressure turned what could have been a tricky afternoon into a controlled one and another victory for United this year.

Man City didn't get the result they wanted, but Coffey's latest WSL minutes continued to show why her arrival matters a lot in the middle. In a high-leverage matchup against Arsenal, Coffey brought steadiness to City's midfield moments. She was ultimately tidy in possession, positionally sharp, and took on the not-so-glamorous part of the game, bodying up Kim Little and Mariona Caldentey. 

This defeat felt less like a midfield collapse and more like a day when City's usual edge never fully surfaced. Even so, Coffey's presence offered another snapshot of what she can add to the middle. ","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Lando Norris 'proved to myself that I have what it takes' after title success

Cadillac presented their first ever F1 livery to the world with a pair of launches in the United States.

Cadillac made headlines on Sunday night when the F1 newcomers showcased their 2026 livery with simultaneous launches at Times Square and around coverage of the Super Bowl.

As the team's debut season edges ever closer, Cadillac combined a presentation at the famous New York spot with a television advert during the annual championship game of the National Football League (NFL) – this year held in Santa Clara, California.

It was the latest step in a momentous journey for the American-led operation, whose CEO Dan Towriss took a moment to reflect while speaking to selected media, including F1.com, in the hours after the launch.

“It was a tremendous event for us last night, to be able to show the car to the world, and to launch this team,” he commented.

“I think for us, as a team, it's a moment to reflect on all the hard work that's been done to get to this point, but I think also launching the livery, our racing livery, is an inflection point. Now, it's all about racing. We've spent a lot of time in the press talking about the entry process and building a team from scratch, but now, it's all about racing.

“Even as we speak, the car is on track doing promotional days in Bahrain. Again, a very momentous day for us, and it was great to go right from the livery launch to the car being on track just a few hours later.”

As well as explaining what went into the dual launch, Towriss opened up on why Cadillac ended up with their split black-and-white livery design.

“We see real meaning in the colours,” he stressed. “For us, black represents this bold attitude of the car. I think when you see the black side it looks a little mean, and it has some attitude. Then white, which is the actual racing colour of America… We wanted to have white on the car. It's fresh, it's clean, it's optimistic. It's really the balance of those two.

“The livery is the identity of the team, and so this represents us. Some people look to the Cadillac badge, and see the red, yellow and blue, but when you get into high performance, Cadillac goes monochromatic in their badging. It's an element of the brand that we wanted to lean into for F1, the pinnacle of motorsport.”

Cadillac will be back in action at the Bahrain International Circuit on Wednesday, when the first of two official pre-season tests gets under way.

Chris Pratt returns as the title character in the animated film that Universal releases this spring.

	Ryan Gajewski


Senior Entertainment Reporter


	Mario and his friends are going for gold in the Super Bowl trailer for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie.


	Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic serve as directors for the animated sequel feature that Universal Pictures is set to release theatrically April 1. Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Day, Jack Black, Keegan-Michael Key, Benny Safdie, Kevin Michael Richardson and Brie Larson round out the voice cast. 




The Super Mario Galaxy Movie centers on Mario (Pratt) and Luigi (Day) getting to know dinosaur pal Yoshi as they accompany Princess Peach (Taylor-Joy) and Toad (Key) on a voyage to outer space.

	This latest trailer teases the heroes butting heads with Bowser Jr. (Safdie), who declares, “The great battle of my life draws near!” A later moment features Yoshi eating Kamek (Richardson). 


	Horvath and Jelenic, the directors of 2023's The Super Mario Bros. Movie, return to helm the sequel from a script by Matthew Fogel, who also penned the original. Hailing from Illumination and Nintendo, the new movie counts Chris Meledandri and Shigeru Miyamoto as producers. 


The Super Mario Bros. Movie surpassed $1.3 billion at the global box office, becoming the year's second-highest-grossing title (behind Warner Bros.' Barbie). The films adapt Nintendo's long-running Mario video game franchise.


	In his review of The Super Mario Bros. Movie for The Hollywood Reporter, critic Frank Scheck wrote that it “feels like a labor of love that should easily weather any nitpicking from purists.” He added that the film “features one jam-packed sequence after another.”

Singer-songwriter Charley Crockett offered up his support to Bad Bunny's Super Bowl Halftime Show performance, and took aim against Elon Musk and Donald Trump.


													By
												

	Jessica Nicholson



	As much of the country geared up for this year's Super Bowl on Sunday (Feb. 8), Americana-country singer-songwriter Charley Crockett offered up his support for Bad Bunny‘s Super Bowl halftime show performance, and took aim against Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, President Donald Trump and the “country music establishment” in an Instagram post.


	“They keep saying I'm a cosplay cowboy but they love a cosplay president,” Crockett wrote on Instagram. “Some folks have been on here calling Muhammad Ali a draft dodger when yall got one in the White House. When I was at the Grammys the other night I saw a guy get up and talk about Jesus, and then I saw Bad Bunny get up there and talk like Jesus. The country music establishment should be taking notes on a Puerto Rican American who hasn't forgotten his heritage and brought his culture's traditional music back to the front, showing the world something new with it. The President is a grifter who bankrupted 6 casinos. That's pretty extraordinary considering it's a rigged business in favor of the house. The only thing he's good at is filing lawsuits and portraying a successful business man as a reality TV actor. Last time I checked Elon Musk was an immigrant from South Africa but there he is standing in the White House buying our elections. Let's deport his a– and send Peter Thiel back with him since they both openly believe in a post democratic society where men of their class are above the law.”

	











	Crockett continued, “Forgive me if I have a problem with a 34 time convicted felon running this country when I lost the right to vote or own a weapon for years over marijuana. As long as you're hating the oppressed and loving your oppressor you'll never know why our generation is poorer than our parents and grandparents. As a great man once said it's welfare for the rich and rugged individualism for the poor. If you can sleep at night licking their boots that's between you and yours, but that type of thinking isn't freedom. It's mental slavery. Every single right we have as a people wasn't handed to us. We had to fight and take it.”




	Crockett ended by writing, “Judge a man by how he treats the poor and those who he views as being able to do nothing for him. Don't forget why Muhammad Ali said ‘I am America.' Remember the coal miners of Harlan County, Kentucky. I believe in what we can be. Ride on.”


	Last year, Crockett signed with Island Records, releasing his first album via the label, Lonesome Drifter, in March 2025. At the 2025 Americana Music Awards, Lonesome Drifter was nominated for album of the year, while Crockett was nominated for artist of the year.


	To date, Crockett has earned two Grammy Grammy nominations, including best traditional country album (for A Dollar a Day) and best Americana album (for $10 Cowboy). This year, he will headline the Music City Rodeo, alongside Miranda Lambert and Jon Pardi.

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Editor-In-Chief


EXCLUSIVE: In one of those “This is Hollywood, land of dreams” stories the aspirational epilogue in Pretty Woman is about, a spec script by a 20-something British actor with one produced episodic writing credit triggered a heated bidding war among top TV producers, networks and streamers, landing at A24 in a seven-figure deal with Nicole Kidman among A-listers in talks to star, Deadline has learned.


	The writer's name is Dylan Brady, and the spec script is an untitled erotic thriller. (The project was originally titled Discretion; it will undergo a name change, in part not to be confused with the legal thriller drama series Discretion A24 has at Paramount+ with Nicole Kidman and Elle Fanning starring).

	The untitled drama centers on a struggling actor who takes a nannying job with a high-flying producer and her movie-star husband, plotting to seduce his employers and exploit their industry connections only to find himself ensnared in a far more dangerous game.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The spec ranked second on the 2025 The Brit List — the British and Irish equivalent of The Black List, featuring top unproduced film and TV scripts — which came out in early November. At the time, Deadline profiled Brady, who didn't have U.S. representation, and Discretion, which had been optioned by Kudos. (The British production company will remain attached.)


	By the end of 2025, Brady was signed by a U.S. agency, UTA, after being identified by a young agent and an assistant there. He is repped by UTA's co-head of TV Lit Dan Erlij, the architect behind the big auction last fall over another spec, Joshua Zetumer's supernatural drama Pagans, which was won by Netflix with a straight-to-series order after some 15-18 studios, platforms and producers bid for it.

	











	Brady's Discretion also sparked a bidding war when it was sent out last month, with nine offers on the table from the likes of Netflix, Amazon, Apple, FX, Peacock and others, sources said. There has been great curiosity about Brady, a virtual unknown as a writer, and some 27 meetings have been set up for him with producers, studios and networks.


	He flew in from the UK Friday night for the meetings, in which he was to lay out his ideas for the rest of the series. By Saturday morning, before Brady had a chance to start the process and while Netflix and Amazon were still making bids, A24 took the project off the market preemptively after a 24-hour blitz with a substantial seven-figure offer, sources said. Conversations started with Kidman and other top actors for lead roles.


	This has become a signature MO for A24. Last year, the company won a seven-way bidding war for Trigger Point, a spec script by Harrison Query. A24 developed the project internally and attached Joel Edgerton to star and Jeremy Saulner to direct before taking it out, sparking a bidding won by Netflix with a straight-to-series order.


	Similarly, A24 acquired the rights to Chandler's Baker's yet-to-be-published short story Discretion in a highly competitive situation with a 7-figure purchase price and additional million dollars in script/development fees. After attaching Nicole Kidman and Elle Fanning and writer Susannah Grant, the package was taken out and, in a bidding war, went to Paramount+ with a straight-to-series order. Both series are produced by A24-based Joe Hipps.


	Brady told Deadline in November that inspiration for the series came from a real-life friend who took on a job as home-help to a high-powered couple, before becoming entwined in their lives. The project takes references from Fatal Attraction, Eyes Wide Shut, and Sunset Boulevard while aiming to subvert storytelling conventions. 


	“Erotic thrillers have historically always been very heterosexual, and it's the marital unit that is the hero that has to be preserved at all costs from an evil slut, who threatens that unity,” he said. “I thought about what this looks like in 2025. What if the slut is the hero and there is something rotten in the marriage? I wanted to break form and put a queer lens on it.”


	In addition to the title change, the drama is expected to undergo creative tweaks as it moves forward.


	As an actor, Brady has appeared on such series as The Diplomat, Andor, Tell Me Everything and Coronation Street. As a writer, his sole produced credit to date is an episode of the short-lived 2023 British YA series for Netflix Everything Now. He is working on his self-funded short Anon starring Con O'Neill, shot entirely on dash cam in his home city of Derby, and has another series project in development with Kudos for the BBC, an adaptation of Charlotte Vassell's novel The Other Half. Brady, who was mentored by All of Us Strangers director Andrew Haigh through the BFI Flare x BAFTA Cohort scheme, is also repped by Charlotte Knight of Knight Hall Agency in the UK.


	The erotic thriller genre has been enjoying a major comeback, with at least 10 TV and film projects in the works. The untitled Brady project is joining such series in development as Hancock Park at Netflix and Fifth Season starring Regé-Jean Page, Teach Me at Peacock starring Mandy Moore, and two more projects at Fifth Season, Night Float starring Nina Dobrev and Dangerous Liaisons.

A24 can no longer get favorable talent deals as they did when they were starting.  The budgets are getting higher, the packages more expensive.  Can they transition to play against larger companies and remain profitable?

Additionally, can they or anyone outperform the mean long-term?  Feige couldn't, Nexfix TV couldn't, Pixar reverted, perhaps it is impossible.

Kidman? Please no. Choose someone else

high sale spec script.  same movie we have seen before

Good for him. Love hearing stories like this. Make your dreams come true….

Sorry but oh please. Haven't we seen this before?

yes and starring Nicole Kidman!

Uh, not really. This is a solid logline that got my attention. I think it sounds cool. As someone who grew up watching movies like Sliver, I'm here for it. (I like all movie genres).

					By Matt Grobar 

Senior Film Reporter


	After taking notice of the use of a piece of music from their 2017 film Phantom Thread in Amazon MGM Studios‘ Melania Trump documentary Melania, filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson and composer Jonny Greenwood are requesting its removal.


	“It has come to our attention that a piece of music from Phantom Thread has been used in the Melania documentary,” said the duo in a statement issued by Greenwood's camp.


	They noted that while “Jonny Greenwood does not own the copyright in the score, Universal failed to consult Jonny on this third-party use which is a breach of his composer agreement. As a result Jonny and Paul Thomas Anderson have asked for it to be removed from the documentary.”

	











	A cultural lightning rod released in theaters January 30 with a global rollout, Melania follows the current First Lady during the 20 days leading up to President Donald Trump's second inauguration in January 2025. While the doc has already grossed far more than many docs do, with over $13 million in its first two weekends, it's been the subject of controversy ever since it was announced by Amazon MGM in January 2025.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Reportedly, the studio paid a staggering $40M for the doc, along with a forthcoming docuseries, and spent around $35M on marketing efforts, which would make Melania one of the most expensive docs ever, all things considered. Some have speculated the investment was politically motivated. Then, there's the fact that the film is directed and produced by Brett Ratner, who was accused of sexual misconduct in 2017 and has more or less flown under the radar ever since.

	











	Marking Radiohead guitarist Greenwood's fourth collaboration with Anderson following There Will Be Blood, The Master and Inherent Vice, Phantom Thread was a psychological drama centered on a haute couture '50s London dressmaker (Daniel Day-Lewis) and the young waitress (Vicky Krieps) he takes as his muse, leading to a twisted love affair. The film earned myriad Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Score, following its release through Focus Features.


	Greenwood and Anderson have more recently teamed on One Battle After Another, the darkly comedic thriller starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Teyana Taylor, Chase Infiniti, Benicio Del Toro and Regina Hall, which has picked up 13 Oscar nominations, with Greenwood in the running once again for Score. Anderson is looking likely to finally break through — in Best Picture, Director and/or Adapted Screenplay — with 14 nominations but no wins to date.


	Amazon MGM couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

International TV Co-Editor


EXCLUSIVE: BBC Studios is developing U.S. versions of sleeper hit family comedy Here We Go and time travel series Mammoth, with Universal Television and Amy Poehler's Paper Kite attached to the former and Fox to the latter.


BBC Studios has seven developments with American platforms and streamers in place, productions boss Zai Bennett revealed to Deadline, as the team looks to unearth the next Ghosts, a British show that was remade for CBS to acclaim.


Here We Go is being penned by Emmy-winning The Good Place writer Matt Murray with Poehler exec producing for Paper Kite. Created by Tom Basden and starring Katherine Parkinson, Alison Steadman and Jim Howick, it was recently recommissioned for a fourth season. Set in the town of Bedford, it follows the dysfunctional and eccentric trials of the Jessop family. It first emerged in Covid-19 under the working title Pandemonium and takes a shaky camera approach to filming, which could work well in the States.

	Meanwhile, Mammoth, which recently launched Season 2 on the BBC, stars and is created by Welsh comic and actor Mike Bubbins. The well-received show follows a Welsh PE teacher who is trapped by an avalanche in the late 1970s on a ski trip and wakes up on New Year's Day 2024. After his initial period of fame ends, Mammoth – technically a man in his nineties, but with a body of a man in his forties – returns to his job at school. Fox Entertainment is co-producing the U.S. version with BBC Studios.

	











	Along with versions of This Country and Miranda, Ghosts emerged from a successful BBC Studios partnership with Lionsgate, which elapsed two years back. 


	BBC Studios productions boss Bennett said Ghosts provides a blueprint for what can be done with American comedy and “it would be nice to have some of those where we are the lead studio.” “You want to own the economics,” he added.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Sony's sports cartoon Goat knows just enough ball","https://www.avclub.com/goat-review","Mon, 09 Feb 2026 17:02:42 GMT","

Sony Animation went through a number of styles before landing on what has become their belated signature. They're now closely associated with the juddery, angular, splash-page artistry of the Spider-Verse movies and KPop Demon Hunters, but at one time Sony was reliably unreliable, sometimes purveying CG squash-and-stretch throwbacks (the Hotel Transylvania and Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs series), barely-distinguishable cuteness (Surf's Up), and outright garbage (movies featuring various emojis and Angry Birds). Their new project, Goat, is a chance to see whether the studio's new, and newly influential, house style can be equally compatible with a boilerplate talking-animal story lacking the fantastical, gravity-defying, zeitgeist-friendly visions of superheroes and girl groups.

Well, a little bit of gravity still gets defied; Goat is a basketball cartoon in all but name, focusing on an animal world where creatures of all shapes and sizes (but mostly big ones) play “roarball,” which looks a lot like basketball, but with some additional, videogame-like environmental challenges. (How is it not called beastketball?!) Will Harris (Caleb McLaughlin)—a scrappy little goat, not the equally scrappy A.V. Club contributor—aspires to play pro roarball, despite the fact that he's constantly told he's too small to compete with the likes of Jett Fillmore (Gabrielle Union), the possibly-fading star of his local team, the Thorns. But when a video of Will holding his own against the towering superstar Mane Attraction (Aaron Pierre) goes viral—finally, a movie that offers the chance for characters to repeatedly say “going viral!”—he's recruited to join the Thorns and play alongside his hero Jett, as well as a small ensemble of potentially great but currently scattershot misfits. Nick Kroll playing a zany, Uno-dealing Komodo dragon; things of this nature.

McLaughlin, best known as Lucas on Stranger Things, is joined by several of his costars from that show: David Harbour voices a rhino teammate, while Eduardo Franco (also known as Argyle) joins Sherry Cola as Will's pair of supportive besties. Maybe even more of that cast should have been recruited, just to give this grab bag of vocalizations a little more unity. It's always a little weird to hear someone who has previously given a perfect voiceover performance in a top-tier cartoon, as Patton Oswalt did in Ratatouille, demoted to jostling around in a supporting role amidst up-and-comers (Pierre), veteran actors not known for their animation work (Union), and assorted stunt-casters (Jelly Roll; producer Stephen Curry).

There are dozens of ways in which Goat plays very much like a generic animated sorta-comedy that could have come from any number of second-to-fourth-tier studios. (At least this attempt to capitalize on vaguely urban youth culture doesn't feature talking sneakers.) Even the distinguishing feature of its basketball roots largely breezes by in a series of montages, with attempted jazz-ups via the natural world's intrusions upon the court (falling rocks, ice formation, etc.). It seems to want some free-throw points for being somewhat more respectful of the game than the alternately prank-based and cornily reverential treatment seen in the Space Jam duology.

But two things keep Goat from becoming the Sing of animated sports movies. One is that Sony animation style, even if this version looks more like Diet Spider-Verse than KPop Demon Ballers. Though the visual and joke density doesn't match the best recent Sony cartoons, the character designs make the characters' size disparities fluid and appealing, like the whole movie is taking place during that scale-shifting chase scene from the original Zootopia. The second is the degree to which director Tyree Dillihay appears to trust both the animation style and his story, and doesn't push too hard to pack the movie with nonstop yammering. It's antic, sure, and has plenty of middling jokes. But Will makes a sweet-natured and earnest hero, and it's particularly nice to see a movie where a young male unabashedly hero-worships a female athlete. Roarball is both a mixed-species and coed professional sport, true to the movie's unforced sense of inclusivity.

That's all to say that Goat seems self-evidently unembarrassed to admit that it is, in fact, a movie for kids. At the same time, it's not relentlessly pandering to that audience; it just trusts that younger kids will become invested in a zippy little sports story, and their parents can enjoy the playful craft of the animation, or perhaps let their minds harmlessly wander. The movie is a little more fun in its early stretches, as it explores the ramshackle jungle-canopy-style city of Vineland. (Somehow, its name is not changed to One Basketball After Another.) The actual sports stuff feels a little sweatier, with too much clamor for each animal teammate to really pop. But Goat still leaps over the worst pitfalls of big-studio kid-centric animation. Where it counts, the movie knows just enough ball.

In the wake of Bad Bunny's momentous halftime show at Super Bowl LX on February 8, musicians, politicians, and many others are giving the Puerto Rican artist his flowers.

On X, New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani wrote, “NUEVAYoL” alongside the Puerto Rican flag emoji, while Mavi remarked: “this shit hard im finna stop speaking English actually fuck English.” The Marías expressed some Puerto Rican pride, writing: “boricuaaaa.” Rauw Alejandro posted about the many Latin genres and dance styles Bad Bunny included in the show. He wrote, in Spanish: “Long live the BOMBA, the PLENA, the SALSA, the HIPHOP and above all LONG LIVE REGGAETON.” Ben Stiller also congratulated him, posting: “Incredible Half time show Bad Bunny.”

Kacey Musgraves pointedly called out the conservative non-profit Turning Point USA's “All-American Halftime Show,” which streamed on YouTube at the same time as Bad Bunny's performance and featured Kid Rock. “Well. That made me feel more proudly American than anything Kid Rock has ever done,” Musgraves wrote.

Doechii, who made her own appearance at the Super Bowl in an ad for Levi's jeans, posted on X: “Bad Bunny WOW ! Fucking, WOW. History.” On Threads, Kerry Washington echoed the sentiment, sharing: “I don't know if I'll ever recover from that… WHAT👏🏾A👏🏾SHOW👏🏾.” SG Lewis said: “Holy shit that was the best half time show I've ever seen” and Monte Booker concurred, posting: “one of the best half times.” Nick León also supported the artist, writing: “Love bad bunny forever.” Nancy Sinatra felt similarly, quoting a post from Lynda Carter about Bad Bunny with: “Love him.” John Mellencamp added, “I don't know what Bad Bunny is saying, however, I do know he is standing up for Puerto Rico and I am standing up for him. His half time show was great.”





Bad Bunny's halftime show was a love letter to Puerto Rico and Latinx communities around the world with ambitious set design and many, many special guests. Artists who joined him included Lady Gaga (with whom he salsa danced), Ricky Martin, Karol G, Young Miko, and Cardi B. The performance capped off a huge week for Bad Bunny, who also won Album Of The Year for Debí Tirar Más Fotos at the Grammys on February 1.

Backup dancers, some dressed as grass and others in head-to-toe Puerto Rican jíbaro regalia—traditional all-white clothes topped with a straw pava hat—crowded the stage. The iconic pink casita that has played a central role in Bad Bunny's Debí Tirar Más Fotos live show was being put together. The man himself was rubbing his hands together, hyping himself up as all around him a miniature Borikén was being built in the middle of Levi's Stadium in San Francisco, transporting him back home before bringing the flavor of his island to the world yet again.

Pre-show reports of Bad Bunny's long-awaited Super Bowl halftime show said it would be a “big party”—and it was. The man of the hour appeared in an all-white jersey emblazoned with “Ocasio 64” and opened with Un Verano Sin Ti standout “Tití Me Preguntó.” He ran through the grass toward the casita's rooftop, running into boxers, baddies at a makeshift nail salon, a piragua stand, and a jeweler who gave him a ring, which he promptly gave away to a dancer: “Muchacho deja eso” (Man, leave that).

The perreo medley raged on, mashing together hits from across Bad Bunny's discography, including “Yo Perreo Sola,” “Safaera,” “Party,” “VOY A LLeVARTE PA PR,” and a nod to OG marquesina parties that featured bits of songs by Daddy Yankee and Tego Calderón before seguing into “EoO.” After violin-tinged “MONACO,” he looked into the camera and almost whispered to the viewer: “Nunca dejé de creer en mí, y tu también deberías creer en ti.” He never stopped believing in himself, so maybe you should believe in yourself.

Bad Bunny's massive global fanbase is drawn to this authenticity. With 19.8 billion streams in 2025 and a historic Grammy win for the first Spanish-language Album of the Year, keeping it real has meant downing Smashburgers and having his therapist on speed dial. It wasn't Bad Bunny's first time on the field (real ones remember Benito in an all-silver getup playing second fiddle to Shakira during her co-headlined Super Bowl performance with Jennifer Lopez six years ago), but Bad Bunny's headlining slot for Super Bowl LX was the first time in the NFL Championship's 60-year history where the main performance was done entirely in Spanish.

Talking to Zane Lowe on the Thursday before, wearing big sunglasses, a gray fur coat, and a bunny-eared beanie, Benito seemed visibly tired. He said he wanted to think of this latest career milestone, performing on the most-watched TV event of the year, as “13 minutes doing something that [he loves].” It's a sweet way to process the moment, and it showed in how he went about the affair—with fun, love, pleasure, and unabashed joy.

You can't say the man didn't have a ball. Watching him crowdsurf to “NUEVAYoL” and run around in his Sunday best, paying homage to Boricuas on the island and the rich Nuyorican culture thriving in New York City, was extremely satisfying. Latinxs who have found refuge in Williamsburg social club Toñitas will have been moved to see the legendary Nuyorican stronghold's namesake matriarch where she is usually found: behind a bar, with a kind word to give, squeezing liquid courage into Benito's hand.

In true Bad Bunny fashion, there was also a lot of tenderness and righteousness to balance out the shots of rum. In a heartwarming and time-bending set piece, Benito bequeathed his Grammy award to a small child who was just watching his acceptance speech on an old TV. Ricky Martin, one of the first Puerto Rican entertainers to go mainstream in a big way, sang the anti-colonial warning song “LO QUE LE PASÓ A HAWAii,” voice trembling. Nearby, dancers on telephone poles were electrified as the opening notes of “El Apagón” began, one of Bad Bunny's most overtly political songs about the ongoing blackouts on the island.

Bad Bunny's performance was not just a big party or a reminder to the mainland that La Isla del Encanto is, in a sense, a part of the United States. As a Latinx viewer watching during a particularly fraught point of U.S. history, I also wouldn't say it's a performance that saves the world. (Donald Trump certainly didn't get it.) “God bless America,” Bad Bunny shouted, waving the Puerto Rican flag, backed by dancers holding the flags of every country in North, Central, South America, and the Caribbean. As the a capella strains of “DTMF” played, he spiked the football at the goal line, proclaiming “Puerto Rico, seguimo' aqui.” Puerto Rico, we still here.

	From the good to the Bad Bunny to the cringe, Super Bowl LX had it all. And while the Seattle Seahawks trounced the New England Patriots, the real ones know that it doesn't matter who wins or loses on the field. And no, it also doesn't even matter how you play the game. The most important part of the night is, for many, the commercials. For the 2026 edition, the Big Game went big on the Backstreet Boys, butts (you read that right), and mushy ads that would warm up even a zero-degree day in New York City. And lest we forget AI: because before it's guaranteed to destroy humanity, at least we can make some entertainment out of it. Here are some of the most notable ads of the night. 


	Cue John Williams' famed fanfare! One of the most easily rewatchable movies of all time, everybody knows that the crux of Jurassic Park is when the power goes out on the island and hell breaks loose. In this clever Xfinity spot which links fan-favorite IP to the company's goals, Jurassic stars Sam Neil, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum reunite to get the park up and running again, no problemo. And of course, they had to throw in some modern-day references, including selfies with dinosaurs. Say roar! I mean, cheese.


	Let us get this straight: It's a commercial for OpenAI, yet everything in it is analog? If you asked an artificial intelligence platform the main takeaway from this ad, it'd be hypocrisy wins. With images of people reading books, playing games, and faces like Einstein flashing on the screen, one would never think it's all meant to promote a product that bastardizes years of human ingenuity. Then again, it makes sense considering AI probably made the whole thing.


	Forget about A.I.: asses and butts are a trend this Super Bowl. And Novartis blew Kellogg's out of the water (no pun intended). Depicting zenned-out football players who are tight ends (get it?) doing yoga and relaxing on hammocks (listening, naturally, to Enya's classic “Only Time”), the ad promotes early-detection prostate cancer screenings. Considering the number of fellas watching the game, it's saving lives with silliness.


	Put on a red cardigan and tie your shoes in preparation to hear a sentiment America needs right now coupled with the powerhouse voice of a superstar and one of the most endearing songs, well, ever. Rocket and Redfin managed to recruit halftime surprise guest Lady Gaga for their Super spot where she lushly sings the iconic theme to Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood. Teased in a black and white preview video dripping with saccharine and sincerity. As for the actual commercial for an otherwise unexciting mortgage company, was it covered with a bit too much schmaltz, not to mention a little tone deaf — it takes a lost dog to get the white family to pay attention to their new neighbors? Perhaps let's just focus on the music.


	First they collaborated on The Favourite, then the deliciously twisted Poor Things, followed by the mindbending Kinds of Kindness, and then Bugonia. Their next project? Well, it's for Squarespace. You read that right: Visionary and eccentric director Yorgos Lathimos and Emma Stone teamed up for this unique spot for the website-building platform complete with the duo's typical cinematic trademark, combining eye-popping cinematography and a dramatic performance in a commercial that's both dark and dryly hilarious. Is it too late to add a Best Commercial category to next month's Oscars?


	It's not that we have anything against this commercial. It's just that seeing the Mayor of Flavortown himself, Guy Fieri, dressed like a normal guy is downright freaky. When Fieri first posted a portrait of him without his trademark frosted tips and goatee (leaving out the fact that it was part of an ad campaign), the collective public let out a gasp. Will this get people talking? Yes. Will it sell Bosch appliances? Well, maybe not. What's Fieri without his flavor?


	Pass the chips… and the tissues. Snack brands are typically known for their asinine ads and catchy slogans. (Once you pop you can't stop, anyone?) Lay's went in the complete opposite direction for their latest Super Bowl ad, emphasizing the potatoes that make up those addictive chips and the folksy farmers who grow them. Designed not only to strike up a craving but to tug at your heartstrings, the commercial is almost inconceivably directed by Taika Waititi, the visionary director of outside-the-box flicks like 2019's JoJo Rabbit (where Hitler himself serves as a boy's imaginary friend). That gives us another reason to cry: Knowing Waititi was behind the lens, it couldn't have been at least a little bit kooky? It's like hiring Guy Fieri and not letting him go to Flavortown.


	Sing it with me: “Instacart lets you choose your bananas!” We all knew Benson Boone is a man of many talents, from singing to backflipping. But who knew he could be this funny? In this retro-style spot from director Spike Jonze, Boone holds his own with Ben Stiller in a series where they play an Eighties-era singing duo that, in another dimension, could easily be a feature-length, made-for-streaming movie. Added bonus: a bona fide Boone flip. Would you expect anything less?


	We all know that Sabrina Carpenter has her share of boy trouble (looking at you, manchildren). But for Super Bowl LX, she's trading steaming espresso for crunchy chips. The amusing spot features Carpenter dating a Frankenstein-esque man made entirely of Pringles. Featuring vivid CGI and some funny gags along the way, what earns this commercial WTF status is the fact that Pringles improbably switched up its iconic “Once you pop, you can't stop” logo to a refreshed “Once you pop, the pop don't stop.” Is nothing sacred? You can bet there were dozens of meetings about swapping their famed verbiage, grammatical incorrectness and all.


	Who wouldn't want to have a beer with Peyton Manning, Post Malone, and Shane Gillis? Known for their perennial blockbuster Super Bowl ads, Bud Light assembled a dream team of beer bros who convene at a wedding and tragically see a runaway keg. Cue Whitney Houston's timeless version of “I Will Always Love You” as the poor keg rolls down a cliff, with the guys scrambling to chase it. From its personalities to music placement, humor, and action, it all gives Bud Light a big reason to have one of the best ads of the Big Game.


	If you think about it, Charli XCX is brilliant at having it both ways. On one hand, she tears down and pokes fun at corporate America and packaged pop stars with albums like brat and her new movie The Moment, a feature-length commentary that skewers the idea of selling out. Yet at the same time, she happily inserts herself in the middle of the machine, cashing in with collabs like a pop-up performance for H&M, (from Times Square, no less), to her Big Game ad for UberEats last year. For 2026, Charli teamed up with the probiotic soda brand Poppi, where she and fellow It girl Rachel Sennott goof on “vibes, vibes and vibes,” complete with Poppi taking on the strobe-visuals Charli uses in much of her recent work (which, it bears repeating, lambastes selling out). Then again, is there anything more brat than saying one thing and doing another?


	It's a bubbly question as old as time itself that amounts to apples or oranges: Pepsi or Coke? For the latest shot in the so-called cola wars, Pepsi used Coca-Cola's imagery of their iconic polar bears for their own advantage by depicting a snow-white bear experiencing a crisis of identity who sips Pepsi and… likes it? Also directed by Taika Waititi, the rest of the spot plays out with bears seeing therapists and taking sad walks through the city. Bonus points for the allusion to the Coldplay couple, who went from cuddling at a concert to fodder for a commercial during the biggest game in the world.


	FA rap force since the early 2000s, 50 Cent is known for his gruff persona in and out of da club. For Doordash, the man with the half-dollar-moniker shows that he's actually a big softie, getting silly about beef. No, not the rap kind. The kind you can get delivered. Is there comedy in 50's future? To paraphrase a wise man: Get rich or die laughing.


	When it comes to William Shatner deciding to do this commercial, we have to assume he cashed the check first and asked questions later. Yes, Kellogg's Raisin Bran really spent the going rate of a reported $8 to 10 million to air a Big Game ad where they proudly announce to America that the cereal makes people… well, you know. And the legendary Star Trek Shatner allowed his last name to be associated with it? Pack it up, folks. We're done here.


	For the past couple years, the Dunkin' commercials with Ben Affleck and Matt Damon have been the hit of the Super Bowl. (Remember the orange suits and those wild cameos from Jennifer Lopez and Tom Brady?) So how do the boys from Boston top themselves for 2026? By recruiting a baker's dozen of throwback sitcom stars, reimagining their breakout Good Will Hunting as a Nineties-era comedy with the likes of Jennifer Aniston, Jaleel White, Jason Alexander, Alfonso Ribeiro, and Matt LeBlanc. Reminding one of a cross between Al Pacino's parody ad for Dunkaccino and Adult Swim's Too Many Cooks, aside from what appeared to be some weird de-aging, Dunkin' once again brewed one of the most memorable ads of the night. Extra points for a return of Brady, too.


	Backstreet's back, literally. The Nineties boy-banders made two appearances in the game: First in a surprise performance for a T-Mobile ad, and then in the form of the karaoke version — blue screen and everything — of their American classic, “Everybody” in which the entire country had a singalong. It was so realistic, it freaked viewers out, thinking a feed was crossed or a channel accidentally changed. But let this be a lesson: the more people complain, the more it'll happen. Remember the Tubi spot in 2023 when the screen turned into the menu from a smart TV? Now for better or worse, “everybody's” paying attention to Coinbase.


	What do you get when you combine Danny McBride, Keegan Michael-Key, Hailee Steinfeld, and a bona fide Bon Jovi classic? This deeply absurd ad for an otherwise dull insurance company known for their long-running series of ads with spokesperson Jake from State Farm. In years past, they've done everything from teaming him up with “look-alike” Drake to Arnold Schwarzenegger. This year, they doubled down on the splash with an all-star sing-along, with help from (cue the screams from their dutiful fan army) KATSEYE. Like a good neighbor, State Farm knows how to deliver the commercial goods. Now, about those premiums…

	After performing the national anthem at the 2026 Super Bowl, Charlie Puth shared that his particular arrangement was a tribute to Whitney Houston. The hitmaker put an choral spin on “The Star-Spangled Banner,” showcasing the song on a Rhodes keyboard with a choir and orchestra backing him.


	“Thank you everyone for your kind words,” Puth wrote on X after the event. “It was an honor to sing The National Anthem. I wrote the arrangement in a very specific way to honor Whitney Houston – I hope that was heard.” 


	He added, “Thank you to the Oakland Interfaith Gospel Choir, the Sainted Choir, the Color of Noize Orchestra, Steve Hackman, and Kenny G for joining me on stage. And thank you Adam Blackstone for writing such a beautiful choir part. I love music so much.”

Thank you everyone for your kind words. It was an honor to sing The National Anthem. I wrote the arrangement in a very specific way to honor Whitney Houston- I hope that was heard. Thank you to the Oakland Interfaith Gospel Choir, the Sainted Choir, the Color of Noize Orchestra,…


	Performing the national anthem was a long-held dream for Puth. “I've actually always wanted to do this,” Puth revealed while participating in the Rolling Stone Interview earlier this year. “I just want to show people that I can do it,” he added. “I feel like people don't really think of me as a standalone vocalist at times… It'll be pressure the week leading up to it and the hour leading up to it. But once I'm there, it's going to feel so comfortable and it's going to sound so good.”

	Earlier this week, Puth joined Bad Bunny and the rest of the Super Bowl LX performers for the Apple Music halftime show press conference. “The arrangement is everything for me. I always reverse engineer how I hear my own music in my head, and then it's just pulling it apart and making it a feasible product to to hold,” Puth told Apple music's Zane Lowe. 


	When asked what he hoped fans would take away from his performance of the national anthem, the singer responded, “I want them to feel inspired. I want everybody to know that music is such an amazing thing and can change so many people's lives.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Middle East on the brink of war: Why US-Iran talks may be the last chance for peace","https://www.rt.com/news/632204-middle-east-on-brink-of-war/","Mon, 09 Feb 2026 17:55:00 GMT","

Another round of talks between the US and Iran is expected to be held in the upcoming days. With regional allies on edge and militant groups warning of escalation, the outcome of the negotiations could determine whether diplomacy holds or whether the Middle East slides toward a broader war.

Iran and representatives of the Trump administration are expected to hold another round of talks in the coming days, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Friday.

The announcement follows a six-hour marathon of talks in Muscat, the capital of Oman, where Araghchi and his team met with Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Steve Witkoff, the US special representative for the Middle East, and Gen. Brad Cooper, chief of staff of US Central Command (CENTCOM).

The venue for the next round has yet to be finalized. Oman may be replaced by another Gulf country or possibly Türkiye, but the focus of the discussions is expected to remain unchanged: Iran's military capabilities.

At the center of the agenda is Tehran's nuclear program, which Iran insists is designed solely for civilian energy and research purposes. 

Washington, however, remains deeply skeptical, arguing that Iran's enrichment levels, stockpiles, and technological advances point toward potential military use. The US wants the program either sharply curtailed or dismantled entirely.

But the nuclear issue is only one of several major fault lines separating the two adversaries.

Speaking at a press conference last Wednesday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio outlined what he described as the minimum conditions for the talks to succeed. In addition to nuclear restrictions, Rubio said Iran's ballistic missile program must be addressed, and Tehran must halt its support for armed Islamist groups across the Middle East.

Those demands reflect long-standing US concerns. Iran's missile program is viewed in Washington as a delivery system for a future nuclear weapon, while Iranian backing of groups such as Hezbollah, the Houthis, and various Iraqi militias is seen as a destabilizing force across the region.

Iran, however, has consistently rejected such conditions. Officials in Tehran argue that their missile program is defensive and non-negotiable, especially given the country's experience with war, sanctions, and isolation. Likewise, Iranian leaders have repeatedly framed support for allied groups as a legitimate response to Israeli and Western influence in the Middle East.

For that reason, expectations for a breakthrough remain low.

Iran is unlikely to make meaningful concessions on its ballistic missile program, nor is it expected to abandon its long-standing allies, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. If those positions remain unchanged, analysts warn that the path toward military confrontation becomes increasingly narrow.

Experts have repeatedly cautioned that a direct conflict between Iran and the United States would almost certainly spiral beyond bilateral fighting. Instead, it could ignite a region-wide war, particularly if Iranian-backed groups enter the fray.

A Hezbollah official, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity, echoed those fears, warning that the entire Middle East could be dragged into a full-scale confrontation.

“All countries in the region are prepared for this confrontation,” the official said. “That is why Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Jordan, and others issued statements saying they will not allow their airspace to be used to strike Iran. The Iranian Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, has also stated that any war on Iran will be a regional one. For Tehran, it would be a war of survival. The repercussions will affect all countries in the region.”

Despite the dire warnings, the official stopped short of confirming whether Hezbollah would actively intervene if Iran were attacked.

“We may or may not intervene,” he said. “Sheikh Naim Qassem [Hezbollah's chief – ed.] emphasized the right of resistance and the defense of Lebanon. Our position is that we will not accept the Israelis, or anyone else, striking us while we stand idly by.”

Such statements underline Hezbollah's attempt to maintain strategic ambiguity. Yet analysts note that even if the group wished to intervene decisively, its capacity has been significantly degraded following its most recent confrontation with Israel.

Before the war that erupted in October 2023, Hezbollah was widely believed to possess one of the largest rocket and missile arsenals in the world, estimated at more than 150,000 projectiles. After months of sustained Israeli airstrikes and targeted operations, that stockpile is believed to have shrunk dramatically, by as much as 70 to 80%, according to several assessments. Rocket launchers have also been severely degraded, with some estimates suggesting they have been reduced to a small fraction of their pre-war levels.

The damage has not been limited to weapons. Hezbollah has also suffered heavy personnel losses. Senior figures such as Hassan Nasrallah, Hashem Safieddine, Fuad Shukr, Ali Karaki, and others have been killed. Tunnel systems, storage depots, and command centers have been destroyed, while financial networks that once funneled money to fighters and supporters have been disrupted or crippled.

Still, the Hezbollah official insists the group remains capable of resisting Israel.

“The Israelis know that even after the war ended, resistance rockets were falling in many parts of the entity [Israel], especially in Tel Aviv,” he said.

“They know the war did not end with the resistance losing its capabilities. Quite the opposite is true. This is why the Israelis and Americans are trying to pressure Hezbollah to disarm.”

According to the official, such pressure will not succeed.

“We are a group that refuses to live in humiliation. In our conviction and belief, we are the people of dignity, and we will not accept our country being occupied, aggressions being perpetrated, innocent people being killed, while we stand idly by.”

Similar defiant rhetoric has also emerged from Yemen. Speaking from Sanaa, Houthi spokesman Mohammed al-Bukhaiti told RT that the group has “no concerns at all” when it comes to confronting Israel or the US.

“In fact, we prefer direct confrontation with the American and Israeli enemy over indirect confrontation with their tools in the region or their mercenaries at home,” he said.

We view martyrdom in the cause of God as a victory, not a loss.

Al-Bukhaiti said Iran has “sacrificed a lot” for the Yemeni people and that the Houthis intend to respond “to loyalty with loyalty.”

Yet, as with Hezbollah, the Houthis face serious constraints. Even before the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel that triggered the current regional escalation, Yemen's economy was in dire condition after years of civil war. Israeli strikes on ports and key infrastructure carried out in response to Houthi missile and drone attacks have only worsened the situation, with estimated direct and indirect damages exceeding $1 billion.

Despite these setbacks, al-Bukhaiti claims the group's “military capabilities have increased and developed significantly” and says the Houthis are “more prepared to engage in the coming rounds.” He declined to specify what those capabilities are or what actions the group would take if Iran were attacked.

In the past, Houthi responses have included missile and drone launches toward Israel, attacks on international shipping, disruptions to oil flows, and even interference with undersea internet cables. Should tensions escalate again, analysts believe similar tactics could be employed.

As negotiators prepare to meet again, the gulf between US demands and Iranian red lines remains wide. Whether diplomacy can still rein in the crisis, or whether the region edges closer to a multi-front war, may depend not only on what is said at the negotiating table, but on how far Iran's allies are willing, and able, to go once words give way to action.

U.S. Vice-President JD Vance's trip comes just six months after the Armenian and Azerbaijani leaders signed an agreement at the White House seen as the first step toward peace after nearly 40 years of war.Jonathan Ernst/Reuters

Armenia and the United States agreed on Monday to co-operate in the civil nuclear sector as Washington sought to bolster ties with a former close ally of Russia, months after Washington brokered a peace agreement in the South Caucasus. 

A statement on the nuclear sector deal was signed by Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and U.S. Vice-President JD Vance, who is on a two-day visit to the country.

The two said they had completed negotiations on what is known as a 123 Agreement, which allows the U.S. to legally license nuclear technology and equipment to other countries.

The agreement will allow up to US$5-billion in initial U.S. exports to Armenia, plus an additional US$4-billion in longer-term fuel and maintenance contracts, Vance said.

“This agreement will open a new chapter in the deepening energy partnership between Armenia and the United States,” Pashinyan said at a joint press conference with Vance.

Long heavily dependent on Russia and Iran for its energy supplies, Armenia is now reviewing proposals from U.S., Russian, Chinese, French and South Korean companies to construct a new nuclear reactor to replace its sole, aging Russian-built nuclear power plant, Metsamor.

No choice has yet been made, but Monday's announcement paves the way for an American project to be selected. That would deal a blow to Russia, which traditionally has viewed the South Caucasus as its sphere of influence but whose clout there has diminished as a result of its invasion of Ukraine.

“Considering Armenia's multiplicity of dependencies on Russia, it is a political priority to diversify partners when it comes to nuclear co-operation,” said Narek Sukiasyan, a political scientist in Yerevan.

“The United States seems to be the preference now.”

Vance's visit comes just six months after the Armenian and Azerbaijani leaders signed an agreement at the White House seen as the first step toward peace after nearly 40 years of war.

Vance was also seeking to advance the “Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity (TRIPP)”, a proposed 43-kilometre corridor that would run across southern Armenia and give Azerbaijan a direct route to its exclave of Nakhchivan and in turn to Turkey, Baku's close ally.

The route would better connect Asia to Europe while – crucially for Washington – bypassing Russia and Iran at a time when Western countries are keen on diversifying energy and trade routes away from Russia due to the Ukraine conflict.

The TRIPP corridor, which envisages new or updated rail infrastructure, oil and gas pipelines and fibre-optic cables, would transform the South Caucasus, a region riven by closed borders and longstanding ethnic conflicts.

“We're not just making peace for Armenia,” Vance said. “We're also creating real prosperity for Armenia and the United States together.”

He is set to visit Azerbaijan on Wednesday and Thursday, according to the White House.

Oops, something went wrong

(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin was trading on either side of $70,000 on Monday following a roller-coaster ride at the end of last week.

The original cryptocurrency was little changed at that level following the wide daily swings of more than 13% that undercut investors confidence. Bitcoin on Thursday plunged to $60,033, its lowest since October 2024, before rallying back above $70,000 on Friday.

Traders remain on edge.

“While cryptocurrency prices have managed to bounce from last week's lows, there still seems no rush to pick up coins on the cheap,” said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at investing and trading platform IG. He added that “cryptocurrencies need bullish momentum, and despite the recovery last week that is still lacking.”

Last week's selloff saw Bitcoin volatility surge. The Bitcoin Volmex Implied Volatility Index jumped above 97% in the largest intraday increase since the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX in 2022.

Extreme volatility is nothing new to cryptocurrencies, but Bitcoin's slump from a peak of $126,000 in October last year comes despite the backdrop of a crypto-friendly White House and surging institutional adoption. Its failure to act as a safe haven during a period of heightened geopolitical uncertainty has raised doubts that it functions as a kind of “digital gold.”

Still, in a tentative sign of returning optimism, US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds recorded inflows of $221 million on Feb. 6 as investors sought to buy the dip following the market's dizzying selloff.

“We expect to see decreased liquidity and nervous markets yielding larger moves in the short term,” said Jeff Anderson, head of Asia at STS Digital. “A dip back below $70,000 is less significant as we wait for the next sustained move either below $62,000 or a break above $76,000.”

Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek's goal with ai.com is to build “a decentralized network of autonomous, self-improving AI agents that perform real-world tasks for the good of humanity.”

 Cointelegraph in your social feed 

Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek has officially launched his new website, ai.com, to the public, allowing users to create personal AI agents that can perform everyday tasks on their behalf.

The ai.com commercial aired during Super Bowl 60 on NBC on Monday, leveraging the sporting event's massive audience — over 100 million viewers in previous years — to promote the beta launch of the AI platform.

For now, users can register their ai.com username handles, but must then wait in a queue to have their private, personalized AI agents spun out for them.

Marszalek said the AI agents can perform anything from managing emails and scheduling meetings to canceling subscriptions, carrying out shopping tasks and planning trips. 

Marszalek said his mission with ai.com is to accelerate artificial general intelligence “by building a decentralized network of autonomous, self-improving AI agents that perform real-world tasks for the good of humanity.”

ChatGPT creator OpenAI launched an enterprise-focused AI agent platform, Frontier, last week, while software engineer Peter Steinberger released AI agent OpenClaw in November 2025, which gained popularity in January.

Marszalek said he bought the AI-themed domain in April for $70 million —  the largest publicly disclosed domain sale in history — and has since built a team to bring the product to market.

Pseudonymous crypto and AI researcher 0xSammy said the move resembles how Marszalek scaled Crypto.com to over 150 million customers by buying a popular domain and investing heavily in marketing:

Marszalek said ai.com had “insane traffic” in the first few hours after launch, which briefly caused the website to crash before it came back online.

Google ran a 60-second Gemini AI advertisement during Super Bowl 60, while Anthropic also ran a commercial promoting its Claude chatbot.

Anthropic is in the final stages of raising $20 billion in new capital at a valuation of $350 billion, Bloomberg reports, with investor demand leading the company to raise twice the funding it set out to obtain. The company raised $13 billion in equity funding just five months ago, but intense competition between frontier labs and the ongoing cost of compute has made it eager to raise as quickly as possible.

Firms expected to participate in the round include Altimeter Capital Management, Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Menlo Ventures, Coatue Management, Iconiq Capital, and Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, but the bulk of the funding is said to come from the company's strategic partners Nvidia and Microsoft.

Anthropic is building on recent successes, most notably the deployment of its coding agents, which have software engineers raving about increased coding productivity. Last week, the company's release of new models focused on legal and business research rattled the share prices of publicly traded data firms as investors worried about the ability of AI to disrupt their businesses.

Anthropic's rival, OpenAI, is reportedly assembling a new $100 billion fundraising round, and both companies are thought to be preparing IPOs ahead of a blockbuster summer in the markets, with xAI, recently acquired by SpaceX, also tapping public equity as part of the rocket maker's IPO.

Portugal superstar ready to end strike as Al-Nassr pencil in return date","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/cristiano-ronaldo-to-return-portugal-superstar-ready-to-end-strike-as-al-nassr-pencil-in-return-date/blt51ce6b772e8bc203","Mon, 09 Feb 2026 16:07:30 GMT","

Cristiano Ronaldo is reportedly ready to end his strike at Al-Nassr as he prepares to return for the Saudi Arabian club. The former Real Madrid and Manchester United superstar had refused to play for his side in protest at their transfer dealings in January, missing the team's last two matches, but Al-Nassr have now pencilled in the date for their superstar's return.

Per A Bola, Ronaldo is already back in training with Al-Nassr after missing their last two fixtures in protest at their January transfer dealings. Nassr have now pencilled in his return date, against Al-Fateh next weekend. Nassr play Arkadag in Turkmenistan in the Asian Champions League 2 in midweek, but Ronaldo is not set to play in that fixture. 

Reports suggested Ronaldo was affronted by Nassr's lack of activity in the winter window, as they only signed a youth player, while title rivals Al-Hilal were allowed to sign Karim Benzema from Al-Ittihad. PIF owns all three clubs, and Ronaldo was left furious, though A Bola also claims he was angry about payments to workers at Nassr being delayed. Now, Nassr are said to have agreed to pay up, with the power struggle ending with a victory for the forward.

Ronaldo has reportedly threatened to leave Nassr but it is unclear if new political machinations behind the scenes will convince him to stay. A Bola report that two Portuguese executives, Jose Semedo and Simao Coutinho, had seen their powers reduced ahead of the transfer window, impacting their ability to sign new players, but those responsibilities are now said to have been returned to them. 

Saudi Pro League bosses have taken to reminding Ronaldo that every club in their division operates independently, meaning that the all-time great should raise any issues with his own employers - rather than potentially damage the reputation of the league as a whole.

“The Saudi Pro League is structured around a simple principle: every club operates independently under the same rules,"" they said in a statement.

“Clubs have their own boards, their own executives and their own football leadership. Decisions on recruitment, spending and strategy sit with those clubs, within a financial framework designed to ensure sustainability and competitive balance. That framework applies equally across the league.

“Cristiano has been fully engaged with Al Nassr since his arrival and has played an important role in the club's growth and ambition. Like any elite competitor, he wants to win. But no individual - however significant - determines decisions beyond their own club.

“Recent transfer activity demonstrates that independence clearly. One club strengthened in a particular way. Another chose a different approach. Those were club decisions, taken within approved financial parameters.

“The competitiveness of the league speaks for itself. With only a few points separating the top four, the title race is very much alive. That level of balance reflects a system that is working as intended.

“The focus remains on football - on the pitch, where it belongs - and on maintaining a credible, competitive competition for players and fans.”

Ronaldo's strike has not gone down particularly well with onlookers at home and abroad, with Premier League legend Alan Shearer shocked by his behaviour. 

The league's all-time leading goalscorer said: “There's not many people on over £400,000 a day and go on strike. It must be a nice position to be in to say I'm not coming to work despite being on that amount of money. It's bizarre when you think about it. He's a superstar but going on strike at that level doesn't look good.”

Al-Nassr are currently second in the SPL table, and are just one point behind Al-Hilal, even though their title rivals have yet to lose this season. Ronaldo has yet to win the biggest prize in Saudi and is continuing his quest to do so, ahead of the 2026 World Cup this summer. He will, of course, want to be in the best possible shape for that tournament. ","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
