Top Trump administration officials derailed an investigation into an ICE agent's fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good last month, fearing that a probe by federal agents in Minnesota would undermine the White House's narrative about the killing, according to a New York Times report. However, just after the office obtained a warrant to search Good's car — a process that would include examining blood splatters and bullet holes — they were instructed to halt the inquiry immediately by senior Department of Justice (DOJ) officials, including FBI director Kash Patel. Those senior officials were apparently concerned that the investigation, led by then-Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson, could contradict President Donald Trump's official (and demonstrably false) statements on Good's death, in which he wrongly claimed Good “ran over” the ICE agent, despite concrete video evidence demonstrating that never happened. No future order to investigate Good's killing as a civil rights violation was ever given, and the DOJ has indicated it will not pursue criminal charges against Ross. After their departure, Attorney General Pam Bondi falsely claimed on Fox News that she had fired the officials because “they didn't want to support the men and women at ICE” any longer. Many state officials have expressed frustration with federal investigators over their refusal to cooperate. The federal government has been clear that they are not conducting an investigation into Renee Good's death. But we are,” Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said earlier this month. Several polls indicate that most Americans disagree with the administration's official stance on Good. A Marquette University Law School poll published last week, for example, shows that only 37 percent of respondents felt Good's killing was “justified,” as the administration alleges, with 62 percent saying it was not justified. Separate polling from CNN/SSRS last month found that only 17 percent of Americans would trust the federal government to conduct its own investigation into Good's killing, with 62 percent saying they would trust an inquiry conducted solely by the feds to “some” degree or “not at all.” As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump officials have repeatedly met with secessionist leaders from the province, which has large oil and gas deposits. Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! A separation movement in the Canadian province of Alberta claims to be gaining steam, and its leaders say they now have a meeting booked with U.S. Treasury Department officials. Behind its rallying cry of faith, family, and freedom, the Alberta Prosperity Project wants a new constitution for Albertans — one “that recognizes the Supremacy of God as foundational to Civil Society and the Rule of Law.” Unlike in the province of Quebec, where separatist leaders hold elected office, Alberta's separatist movement has no formal foothold in its province's politics. Quebec, an overwhelmingly French-speaking province, is the only jurisdiction in Canada with a sizable sovereignty movement. The separatist political party, Parti Québécois, is expected to form the next provincial government, and has promised a referendum in its first mandate. Officially, the governing United Conservative Party of Alberta (UCP) is not advocating for sovereignty. On February 4, Smith issued a letter demanding that Alberta be given more say over judicial appointments. As such, it has more representation at the Supreme Court for when Civil Code matters arise). Smith is using the sovereigntist movement to try to extract gains from Ottawa but is not formally supporting the movement. When pressed by journalists about members of her caucus having signed the pro-separation petition, Smith told the Canadian press that she doesn't “police” members of her caucus and they're free to sign whatever petitions they would like. It allows the Alberta government to challenge federal laws that it believes are an overreach into provincial jurisdiction (though the Canadian Constitution already allows for this). There are 5 million people who live in the province. Jeremy Appel, author of a forthcoming book about Smith, says there has been a sovereignty movement in Alberta going back to when the province first joined Canada in 1905. “Canada's state institutions have been completely hollowed out by neoliberalism and Smith is responding to this wave of anger and discontent stemming from that by … displacing the causes onto ‘woke' liberals in Ottawa and Montreal,” he explained. Separatist sentiment rises when Liberal Party politicians are elected in Ottawa, and they tend to be calmed when Conservative Party politicians are in office, he added. Former Progressive Conservative provincial representative for Alberta, Thomas Lukaszuk, recently filed a petition to remain part of Canada. Alberta Prosperity Project leaders have met with U.S. State Department officials at least three times. Appel points to the fact that it isn't just separation activists who are meeting with U.S. officials. Premier Danielle Smith travelled to Mar-a-Lago in January 2025, 10 days before Donald Trump's inauguration. Smith's current Chief of Staff Rob Anderson is a former member of the province's legislative assembly and an Albertan separatist who has an undergraduate degree from Brigham Young University in Utah. On social media, Anderson said the current movement to secede was triggered by Albertans' hatred for former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Trump has consistently referred to Canada as the 51st state, and this group of separatist activists might give the president some of what he wants. With the U.S. administration already meddling in Venezuela over access to oil reserves, Alberta could serve a similar purpose for Trump, giving the United States access to another large deposit of oil and gas. Appel believes that this movement could easily serve as a toehold for the Trump administration to get into Canada. Trump has consistently referred to Canada as the 51st state, and this group of separatist activists might give the president some of what he wants. Canada and the United States have a deeply intertwined energy market. More than any other province, Alberta relies on the United States to purchase its oil. First Nations leaders have been outspoken against the Alberta sovereignty movement. As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iran and representatives of the Trump administration are expected to hold another round of talks in the coming days, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Friday. The announcement follows a six-hour marathon of talks in Muscat, the capital of Oman, where Araghchi and his team met with Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Steve Witkoff, the US special representative for the Middle East, and Gen. Brad Cooper, chief of staff of US Central Command (CENTCOM). Oman may be replaced by another Gulf country or possibly Türkiye, but the focus of the discussions is expected to remain unchanged: Iran's military capabilities. At the center of the agenda is Tehran's nuclear program, which Iran insists is designed solely for civilian energy and research purposes. Washington, however, remains deeply skeptical, arguing that Iran's enrichment levels, stockpiles, and technological advances point toward potential military use. Speaking at a press conference last Wednesday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio outlined what he described as the minimum conditions for the talks to succeed. In addition to nuclear restrictions, Rubio said Iran's ballistic missile program must be addressed, and Tehran must halt its support for armed Islamist groups across the Middle East. Iran's missile program is viewed in Washington as a delivery system for a future nuclear weapon, while Iranian backing of groups such as Hezbollah, the Houthis, and various Iraqi militias is seen as a destabilizing force across the region. Officials in Tehran argue that their missile program is defensive and non-negotiable, especially given the country's experience with war, sanctions, and isolation. Likewise, Iranian leaders have repeatedly framed support for allied groups as a legitimate response to Israeli and Western influence in the Middle East. Iran is unlikely to make meaningful concessions on its ballistic missile program, nor is it expected to abandon its long-standing allies, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. If those positions remain unchanged, analysts warn that the path toward military confrontation becomes increasingly narrow. Experts have repeatedly cautioned that a direct conflict between Iran and the United States would almost certainly spiral beyond bilateral fighting. Instead, it could ignite a region-wide war, particularly if Iranian-backed groups enter the fray. A Hezbollah official, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity, echoed those fears, warning that the entire Middle East could be dragged into a full-scale confrontation. “That is why Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Jordan, and others issued statements saying they will not allow their airspace to be used to strike Iran. The Iranian Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, has also stated that any war on Iran will be a regional one. For Tehran, it would be a war of survival. Our position is that we will not accept the Israelis, or anyone else, striking us while we stand idly by.” Such statements underline Hezbollah's attempt to maintain strategic ambiguity. Yet analysts note that even if the group wished to intervene decisively, its capacity has been significantly degraded following its most recent confrontation with Israel. Rocket launchers have also been severely degraded, with some estimates suggesting they have been reduced to a small fraction of their pre-war levels. Senior figures such as Hassan Nasrallah, Hashem Safieddine, Fuad Shukr, Ali Karaki, and others have been killed. Tunnel systems, storage depots, and command centers have been destroyed, while financial networks that once funneled money to fighters and supporters have been disrupted or crippled. According to the official, such pressure will not succeed. “We are a group that refuses to live in humiliation. In our conviction and belief, we are the people of dignity, and we will not accept our country being occupied, aggressions being perpetrated, innocent people being killed, while we stand idly by.” Speaking from Sanaa, Houthi spokesman Mohammed al-Bukhaiti told RT that the group has “no concerns at all” when it comes to confronting Israel or the US. “In fact, we prefer direct confrontation with the American and Israeli enemy over indirect confrontation with their tools in the region or their mercenaries at home,” he said. Al-Bukhaiti said Iran has “sacrificed a lot” for the Yemeni people and that the Houthis intend to respond “to loyalty with loyalty.” Yet, as with Hezbollah, the Houthis face serious constraints. Even before the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel that triggered the current regional escalation, Yemen's economy was in dire condition after years of civil war. Despite these setbacks, al-Bukhaiti claims the group's “military capabilities have increased and developed significantly” and says the Houthis are “more prepared to engage in the coming rounds.” He declined to specify what those capabilities are or what actions the group would take if Iran were attacked. In the past, Houthi responses have included missile and drone launches toward Israel, attacks on international shipping, disruptions to oil flows, and even interference with undersea internet cables. Should tensions escalate again, analysts believe similar tactics could be employed. As negotiators prepare to meet again, the gulf between US demands and Iranian red lines remains wide. Whether diplomacy can still rein in the crisis, or whether the region edges closer to a multi-front war, may depend not only on what is said at the negotiating table, but on how far Iran's allies are willing, and able, to go once words give way to action.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• DHS funding: Lawmakers are returning to Washington with just days to find a funding solution on the Department of Homeland Security or see an agency shutdown. • Super Bowl reaction: Trump — who skipped the Super Bowl and attended a watch party in Florida — called last night's Bad Bunny's halftime performance “a slap in the face” and claimed “nobody understands a word” said by the Puerto Rican music star. The deadline for funding the Department of Homeland Security is Friday at midnight, but Republican and Democratic negotiators have yet to make significant progress, sources tell CNN. The lack of serious progress over the weekend raises the stakes that funding for the department could lapse in just a matter of days as Democrats have sought to make major reforms to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection practices as part of these talks. Democrats sent some legislative text to Republicans over the weekend that crystalized their list of demands, a source briefed on the matter told CNN. One source characterized it as a car stuck in neutral but sort of rolling down a hill – so not totally stalled out. It's possible that Senate Majority Leader John Thune may need to begin the process of filing cloture on another short-term funding stopgap, known as a continuing resolution, but again, it's not clear that Democrats would back that plan barring significant progress on Republicans meeting their demands on ICE reforms. His jailed associate Ghislaine Maxwell invoked the Fifth Amendment during a virtual deposition as her attorney made an extraordinary overture. She is currently serving time at a minimum security prison in Bryan, Texas. CNN's MJ Lee, Annie Grayer, James Frater, Caitin Danaher and Billy Stockwell contributed to this report. Vice President JD Vance on Monday became the first sitting US vice president (or president) to visit Armenia, where he touted partnerships between the two nations — including US drone technology sales and a civil nuclear cooperation agreement. “Tonight marks a new beginning for Armenia and the United States and the partnership that our country can have together,” Vance said, standing beside Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, whom he endorsed ahead of upcoming elections. Vance praised that Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity, saying it'll ensure “private capital is going to flow into building railroads, into building pipelines, again, to building the interconnectedness that would create real prosperity for the region, but also allow the peace agreement to stick.” Pashinyan, for his part, said he hopes Trump will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2026 and discussed his role on the Board of Peace, confirming he plans to attend an upcoming meeting. Maxwell is prepared to speak fully and honestly if granted clemency by President Trump,” attorney David Oscar Markus said in a statement during the deposition, which he later posted on X. Some may not like what they hear, but the truth matters. Maxwell alone can explain why, and the public is entitled to that explanation.” Trump has not ruled out the possibility of offering Maxwell a pardon or commutation. Trump and Clinton, who appear throughout the files released by DOJ, have denied any wrongdoing related to Epstein. House Oversight Chair James Comer called Maxwell's decision to plead the Fifth “very disappointing” and said lawmakers “had many questions to ask about the crime she and Epstein committed, as well as questions about potential co-conspiracy.” “We will not allow this silence to stand,” Democratic Rep. Melanie Stansbury said. The Clintons are expected to appear behind closed doors later this month for depositions. Jeffrey Epstein survivors urged members of the House Oversight Committee to treat Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell's testimony “with the utmost skepticism” before she appeared for a virtual deposition with the panel, according to a letter shared with CNN. “We urge the Committee to approach Ms. Maxwell's testimony with the utmost skepticism, to rigorously scrutinize any claims she makes, and to ensure that this process does not become another vehicle through which survivors are harmed or silenced,” according to the letter, signed by a group of survivors, including multiple Jane Does and family members of Virginia Giuffre. The group writes that many of them were “harmed” by Maxwell over the course of decades, and that they worry her deposition is “becoming another opportunity for deception rather than truth.” They accused her of repeatedly lying under oath and declining to identify powerful men who were involved in Epstein's sex trafficking operation. She was a central and indispensable architect of Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking enterprise,” they wrote. “Despite this, she has refused to meaningfully cooperate with law enforcement or provide credible, complete information about the scope of the trafficking network.” Ghislaine Maxwell has invoked her Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination in her ongoing deposition with the House Oversight Committee, according to a person familiar with the matter. Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's accomplice, is appearing before the panel virtually. She is currently serving time at a minimum security prison in Bryan, Texas. Jeffrey Epstein's accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell's virtual deposition before the House Oversight Committee has begun, per a source familiar. Another lawyer, Leah Saffian, is with Maxwell in person. Maxwell is currently serving time at a minimum security prison in Bryan, Texas. Markus, who was first to speak at the deposition, has let lawmakers know that Maxwell intends to invoke the Fifth Amendment. He also said she will speak if granted clemency by President Donald Trump. A possible Department of Homeland Security shutdown by the end of the week hinges on a showdown over a DHS funding bill — with Democrats looking to impose limits on ICE agents after the killing of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, and Republicans refusing their key demands. Last week, Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters that efforts to find agreement over the Department of Homeland Security funding bill would “continue through the weekend.” While Thune said he preferred a full-year funding extension as a backup, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries yesterday said he was not willing to accept anything less than Democratic leaders' demands. Jeffries cast blame on Republicans for stalled negotiations on a deal to fund DHS, which includes FEMA and TSA, ahead of the February 13 deadline. Democrats have put forward their list of requirements for a bill to fund DHS and reform ICE, including requiring immigration enforcement agents to wear body cameras and remove face masks and to use judicial warrants, an issue that has been a nonstarter for Republicans. “Either they're going to agree to dramatically reform the way in which ICE and other immigration enforcement agencies are conducting themselves, so that they're behaving like every other law enforcement agency in the country, or they're making the explicit decision to shut down the Coast Guard, shut down FEMA and shut down TSA,” he warned. CNN's Stephen Collinson and Alison Main contributed to this reporting. President Donald Trump arrived back at the White House after midnight, after attending a Super Bowl watch party in Florida last night. This is what's listed on Trump's schedule for today: Several victims of Jeffrey Epstein appeared in an ad released yesterday that demands more transparency from the government as it continues to post documents related to the late sex offender. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer described the video in a social media post as “the most important ad you will see on Super Bowl Sunday.” Jeffrey Epstein's accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell is set to appear for a closed-door deposition on Capitol Hill today, while the Prince and Princess of Wales are speaking out about Epstein as the scandal has engulfed the palace and UK parliament in recent weeks. Maxwell deposition: Maxwell, who convicted of the sex trafficking of a minor and other charges in 2021, will appear before the House Oversight Committee this morning. It is important to note however, that committee chair James Comer expects she will assert her Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination and not actually testify. In the UK: Meanwhile, Prince and Princess of Wales have been “deeply concerned” by revelations from the trove of new documents related to Epstein, a Kensington Palace spokesperson told journalists in Riyadh ahead of Prince William's visit to Saudi Arabia today. Back in the US: GOP Rep. Thomas Massie is calling for Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to resign. Asked on CNN's “Inside Politics” if Lutnick, who appeared to have corresponded with Epstein multiple times, should testify, the Kentucky lawmaker responded, “No, he should just resign.” Documents revealed that Lutnick sought to meet with or call Epstein several times since 2005, including after Epstein pleaded guilty to procuring a minor for prostitution in 2008. And yesterday, several victims of Jeffrey Epstein appeared in an ad that demanded more transparency from the government as it continues to post documents related to the late sex offender. The ad demands that Attorney General Pam Bondi release all files pertaining to various investigations into Epstein, who died in 2019. CNN's Max Foster, Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Annie Grayer, and Micheal Williams contributed to this reporting. In an exclusive interview with CNN's Manu Raju, Kentucky Congressman Thomas Massie says it's time for Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to resign following the latest release of the Jeffrey Epstein files. Here's a round-up of our reporting on the Trump administration's latest foreign policy developments. Talks between Greenland and the United States are not currently where Greenland would like them to be — and it is too early to say what the outcome will be, the Arctic island's foreign minister said yesterday. A key point of contention remains Iran's demand to enrich uranium – a nuclear fuel that can be used to make a bomb if purified to high levels – which the US and its allies reject. CNN's Sophie Tanno, Isabelle D'Antonio, Eugenia Yosef, Max Saltman and Laura Sharma contributed to this post. Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman said yesterday he does not expect Democrats and Republicans to come to an agreement ahead of the February 13 government funding deadline for the Department of Homeland Security. “I absolutely would expect that it's gonna shutdown,” Fetterman, who sits on the Homeland Security Committee, said in an interview with Fox News.“We, the Democrats, we provided, I think it was 10, 10 kinds of basic things, and then the Republican(s) pushed back quickly, saying that that's like a Christmas wish list and that they're non-starters,” he said, adding later: “If I had to say now, I would probably expect that there is going to be a shutdown.” If an agreement to fund DHS is not met, a partial shutdown is on the horizon, which would affect operations in that department. Agencies such as TSA, FEMA and the Coast Guard would all be impacted. Fetterman is one of eight Democrats who broke with their party at the end of last year to vote with Republicans to reopen the government after a 43-day shutdown. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries also raised doubts about the prospect that Democrats and Republicans will come to an agreement on DHS. President Donald Trump — who skipped the Super Bowl and instead attended a watch party in Florida — denounced Bad Bunny's halftime performance as “a slap in the face” and said “nobody understands a word” the Puerto Rican rapper was saying. It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn't represent our standards of Success, Creativity, or Excellence,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. “This ‘Show' is just a ‘slap in the face' to our Country, which is setting new standards and records every single day.” Bad Bunny, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, rocked the stage Sunday night with many of his biggest hits, powerful imagery and theatrical nods to songs and symbols from throughout his Spanish-language catalog. “God bless America, whether it's Chile, Argentina,” Bad Bunny said as he proceeded to list more than 20 nations in North and South America, and displayed the flags of many of them. Lawmakers will have access to computers in a reading room at DOJ where they cannot bring outside electronic devices but can take notes, according to the letter. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced last month upon the department's latest public release of Epstein files that members would be able to schedule appointments to view the unredacted versions. Massie was interviewed by CNN's Manu Raji on Sunday. Jeffrey Epstein's accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of the sex trafficking of a minor and other charges in 2021, is expected to appear for a closed-door deposition on Capitol Hill today. House Oversight Chair James Comer announced last month that he expects Maxwell to assert her Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination and not actually testify. “We have nailed down a date, February 9, where Ghislaine Maxwell will be deposed by this committee. Her lawyers have made it clear that she's going to plead the Fifth. President Donald Trump drew swift condemnation from Democrats and Republicans for a since-deleted racist video posted to his Truth Social account depicting former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama as apes in a jungle. The video Trump shared largely contained debunked claims about fraud in voting machines. Trump said that neither he nor his staff had seen all of the video before it was posted to Truth Social.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The film outpaced expectations over its first weekend, taking in $7.2m domestically and leading Amazon to expand their rollout from around 1,500 venues to just over 2,000. But indications are that appetite had already been sated, with Sunday projections standing at $2.3m, meaning a drop from No 3 to No 10 in the US box office charts. Amazon pre-empted this disappointment with a statement on Saturday, flagging the film's already healthy performance, as well as what they hope will be long streaming legs. “Melania's strong theatrical performance is a critical first moment that validates our holistic distribution strategy, building awareness, engagement and provides momentum ahead of the film's eventual debut on Prime Video,” said Amazon MGM distribution chief Kevin Wilson. A streaming release date has not yet been announced. Although international statistics are hard to source, the film has performed markedly less well across its some 3,000 overseas screens. Top performing territories include the UK, where it opened at No 29 in the chart, taking £32,974 for a £212 per screen average, as well as Australia and Melania Trump's native Slovenia. But audiences appear to have felt otherwise, leading to a record-breaking gap between the aggregate critics' score and audience members' equivalent on reviews curation site Rotten Tomatoes. On that site its official reviews rating is just 8%, yet it has a 99% score from cinemagoers on the “Popcornmeter”, with one user praising “the best documentary I've seen in years. They added: “Reviews displayed on the Popcornmeter are VERIFIED reviews, meaning that it has been verified that users have bought a ticket to the film through Fandango”. However, there appears to be a striking disparity between the warmth of those reviews labelled “verified” because the users have bought a ticket through a particular site and those collected in “all audience reviews” – which do not count towards its rating. Critiques in the “all audience reviews” section tend to derive from accounts with a deeper prior engagement on the site, and include assessments such as “I thought it would have been based on her actual life, good and bad. It's just a bad reality show,” and “Hot garbage.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk's SpaceX curbs illicit use of satellite internet network, which Ukraine says is already affecting operations Ukraine said last week that Starlink terminals being used by Russian troops had been deactivated after talks between its defence minister and Elon Musk, whose company SpaceX operates the satellite network. Moscow had come to rely on thousands of contraband Starlink terminals smuggled into Russia, often through central Asia, to keep units connected along the frontline. The system allowed Russian forces to coordinate movements and drone strikes in areas where military radios were unreliable or easily jammed. Ukraine says Russian units had started fitting drones with Starlink terminals, improving their accuracy and making them harder to disrupt electronically. The move was an early victory for Ukraine's new defence minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, given Musk's past reluctance to be drawn too deeply into the conflict and comments often seen as favourable to Moscow. The shutdown, however, has prompted anger and frustration among pro-war Russian military bloggers who are closely embedded with frontline units. “Elon Musk flipped the switch … our communications are in chaos.” Another large pro-war Telegram channel, Dva Mayora, said the loss of Starlink had already been felt. “The deactivation of Starlink terminals used by Russian forces has had a negative impact on communications in our units,” it posted, adding that troops were rushing to set up backup systems that were “less convenient”. Analysts say alternatives exist but fall well short of Starlink. For short-range links, units can rely on fibre-optic lines, wifi-based radio bridges or digital radio modems, all of which are slower to deploy and harder to use in mobile operations. Russia also has its own satellite communications, including systems run by Gazprom Space Systems, which have been used on a limited scale during the war. But the company operates only a small number of geostationary satellites, meaning patchy coverage and lower data capacity. “For the enemy, Starlink is so important that they are trying to build an entire network of people willing to register terminals for them,” Ukraine's defence ministry said on Telegram, alongside screenshots it said showed Russians advertising for Ukrainian nationals to activate the devices.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The main suspect in the attempted assassination of Russian General Vladimir Alekseyev has confessed to investigators that he acted on orders from Ukraine, according to an interview video released Monday. Alekseyev, the first deputy chief of Russia's military intelligence agency GUR, was shot on Friday in a communal hall of his residence in Moscow. Kiev has denied involvement in the crime. In footage published by Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), the 65-year-old Ukrainian-born Russian citizen said he was already on Kiev's payroll and was promised $30,000 for killing the general. Korba stated he was recruited by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) last August and sent to Moscow to surveil several targets, receiving $2,000 monthly from Ukraine. He said the order to prepare a hit on Alekseyev came in December. In Dubai there was a ticket to Romania. My group of handlers led by a general was supposed to meet me in Kiev,” he said. Korba's acquaintance Viktor Vasin, who helped him rent an apartment, was arrested in Russia and confessed to knowingly aiding the Ukrainian plot, per another FSB video. A third suspect, Zinaida Serebritskaya (née Antonyuk), also born in Soviet Ukraine, has fled Russia. Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) claimed on Feb. 9 that suspects in the assassination attempt on Lieutenant General Vladimir Alekseev, the first deputy head of Russian military intelligence (GRU), had pleaded guilty, Russian state-run media outlet RIA Novosti reported. The FSB earlier said Alekseev's attackers were two individuals, Lyubomyr Korba and Viktor Vasin, who allegedly acted on Ukraine's orders. According to the FSB, Korba and Vasin were allegedly recruited by Ukraine's Security Service (SBU), which promised $30,000 for the assassination of General Alekseev. The FSB also claimed that Polish intelligence was involved in Korba's recruitment, using his son, Lubosz Korba, who lives in Katowice. He then underwent training at a facility in Kyiv before traveling to Moscow via Tbilisi, Georgia, FSB said. Another co-conspirator, Vasin, rented the apartment where Korba lived and provided him with public transportation tickets. All three suspects are reportedly facing charges that could result in life imprisonment. Bulgarian investigative journalist and head of investigations at The Insider, Christo Grozev, suggested on X that one of the suspects, Vasin, works for an FSB-linked company that manufactures surveillance tools. "At least through August 2025, Viktor Vasin was employed as 'chief expert' at NTC Atlas, launched by FSB and now part of military-industrial behemoth Rostec," Grozev wrote. According to him, Vasin also graduated from Russia's military command communications academy, which was listed on his CV in 2014. Alekseev was then involved in suppressing the mercenary uprising and was reportedly seen meeting with the group's leader, Yevgeniy Prigozhin, before Prigozhin died in a plane crash widely suspected of being orchestrated by Russia's intelligence services. Alekseev was shot multiple times in Moscow by an unknown assailant, the Kremlin said on Feb 6. The following day, on Feb. 7, Russian state media reported that Alekseev had regained consciousness after successfully undergoing surgery. He was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2016 for organizing "malicious cyber activities" during the U.S. presidential election of that year which saw Donald Trump win his first term in office. Alekseev has also been accused by the U.K. and EU of orchestrating the chemical weapons attack in Salisbury in 2018 that targeted Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter. Russia launched 11 Iskander-M ballistic missiles and 149 drones at Ukraine overnight, the Air Force said. "It seems that they proposed it and we were ready — and now they are not," Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said. Ukraine targeted a Russian drone warehouse in Rostov-on-Don, located in Rostov Oblast, destroying three containers filled with FPV drones and their components, according to the report. "We are moving from supplies to joint production and long-term solutions that systematically strengthen our defense," Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said. Mazda's Russian subsidiary has publicly introduced two crossover models — the CX-5 and CX-50 — sourced from a plant in China and sold with official warranties.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused the Trump administration of refusing to implement alleged Russia–U.S. agreements on Ukraine and pursuing a policy of "economic domination," in comments to Russian-registered TV BRICS published on Feb. 9. The remarks mark a sharper turn in Moscow's rhetoric toward Washington, with Lavrov claiming the U.S. has backtracked on what he described as "Anchorage agreements" allegedly reached in 2025 that envisioned Ukraine surrendering the entire Donbas region to Russia without fighting. "They tell us that the Ukrainian issue needs to be resolved. "They made an offer, we agreed, and the problem should have been resolved. Lavrov said that despite declarations about moving toward "full-scale, broad cooperation," Washington continues to pursue what he described as an anti-Russian policy. He pointed to new sanctions and Western actions against Russia's shadow fleet of oil tankers as evidence. Russia has long demanded that Ukrainian forces withdraw from Donbas and has increasingly tied any future peace deal to such a move after more than a decade of fighting in the region. Ukraine has ruled out a withdrawal, though Ukrainian officials have said alternative arrangements, including a demilitarized zone, could be considered. Washington has reportedly told Kyiv that security guarantees would follow only after a peace agreement with Russia, a deal widely expected to involve territorial issues related to Donbas. A U.S. source familiar with the matter told the Kyiv Independent that Washington "is not trying to force any territorial concessions upon Ukraine," adding that "both sides must agree to a peace deal, but the contents of the peace deal are up to Russia and Ukraine." Lavrov also criticized the Trump administration for not repealing laws adopted under former U.S. President Joe Biden that imposed sanctions on Russia after the start of its full-scale invasion. President Volodymyr Zelensky has said Washington is pushing for the war to end before the start of summer and may apply pressure on the parties in line with that timeline. Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker pushed back on that characterization, saying on Feb. 9 that the United States has not set any deadline for ending the war. "That June deadline was mentioned by President Zelensky," he said. Tim Zadorozhnyy is the reporter for the Kyiv Independent, specializing in foreign policy, U.S.-Ukraine relations, and political developments across Europe and Russia.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian President Vladimir Putin's initiative to build a Eurasian security architecture is gaining momentum and attracting increasing interest from other countries, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in an interview with TV BRICS. Meanwhile, the United States is reluctant to follow through with its own proposals on Ukraine from the Anchorage summit. TASS has compiled key statements from Russia's top diplomat. The United States is now reluctant to follow through with proposals it put forward on Ukraine in Anchorage, and Russia sees "no promising future in economic terms" with the American side. The US position on Ukraine "was important" to Russia, regardless of what Kiev or Russophobic leaders in the European Union might have said. Not only has the administration of US President Donald Trump challenged the laws enacted by his predecessor Joe Biden "to punish Russia," it has imposed additional sanctions. The core of this "is sanctions against Russia, including the freezing of our gold and foreign currency reserves." The United States has been using unfair methods to suppress its competitors, including by imposing sanctions on Russian oil majors: "Unfair methods have been used against us —banning Russian oil companies like Lukoil and Rosneft." Also, the United States is attempting to control Russia's "military-technical ties with major strategic partners," such as India and other BRICS members. Russia is not advocating for the abolition of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank (WB) or the World Trade Organization (WTO), instead it is has sought to reform those institutions so BRICS can "receive proportional votes and rights in all Bretton Woods institutions, commensurate with their actual weight in the global economy, trade, and logistics." The BRICS grouping can contribute to harmonizing comprehensive development plans across countries of the global majority: "BRICS provides, in effect, an overarching framework for integration across continents." Russia should ensure its security in a situation where some Europe "threaten war against our country:" "Security also requires preventing the continued existence on our borders of a Nazi state created by the West out of Ukraine and used once again to wage war against Russia." The West has unleashed a global war on Russia and is making "frantic attempts" to punish its partners. Russia will reject the deployment in Ukraine of any weapons that may threaten its security interests: "We will, without any doubt, safeguard our security interests by preventing the deployment on Ukrainian territory of any weapons that pose a threat to us." Putin's initiative "to strengthen Eurasian security and build a continental security architecture, is gaining momentum" and increasingly attracting interest from other countries. The initiatives put forward by BRICS, including regarding payments and investments, are not meant to counteract the United States, but rather to establish mechanisms that are independent on Washington's strict control: "These initiatives are not intended as a provocation against anyone, primarily the United States, but rather arise from the fact that the United States places strict control over all processes in these areas and demands unilateral concessions."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>‘Not easy mode' – Exercise Red Flag pits allied pilots against each other in preparation for deadly combat Based in Washington, he has broken a series of world exclusives and covered the defining moments of Donald Trump's administration. Based in Washington, he has broken a series of world exclusives and covered the defining moments of Donald Trump's administration. Two US Marine F-35 B Lightning fighter jets break the clouds and glide into position alongside an RAF Voyager air-to-air refuelling tanker. As the jets swallow 70 tonnes of fuel, four British Typhoons appear from below, their canopies glistening in the sun as they wait for their turn to refuel. The fifth-generation fighters are using state-of-the-art war fighting technology that is so secret that The Telegraph is barred from taking pictures of them. This is Exercise Red Flag – the annual wargame where US, British, and Australian pilots face off against each other in a two-week-long simulation aimed at preparing for war. “This is where war fighters get to practice advanced warfighting,” says Col Tony May, of the US Air Force, who is responsible for running the live wargame. Red Flag, which is held at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, began in 1972 out of the realisation that pilots were not ready for combat when they took to the skies of Vietnam. Where once the pilot's sights may have been set on taking out insurgents in Afghanistan or Iraq, the 2026 simulation is all about preparing for combat bad-actors with a “high technological capability”. Some 12,000 square miles of airspace are turned into a giant “sandbox” which is used to simulate every enemy and mission scenario imaginable in both day and night. “We take all adversary aircraft and we're able to pretend to be them no matter who it is,” says Lt Col Ryan “Chip” Young, commander of the 65th aggressor squadron, which plays the enemy. I am executing tactics as a person would as an adversary, making mistakes, trying to figure out what the blue side is doing. There's a lot of close and long-range fights.” The timing of this year's exercise could not be more significant. Beijing has accelerated its military development to historical levels across land, sea, air, and space. The US's annual report revealed that China expects to be able to fight and win a war on Taiwan by the end of 2027. Last week, it unveiled plans for a space carrier that can deploy unmanned fighter jets capable of firing missiles from the edge of the Earth's atmosphere. Under Nevada's winter sun, allied forces are tasked with striking the enemy's critical infrastructure before taking down radar and air defences. This is where the RAF Voyager, an Airbus A330 fitted with a strengthened airframe and extra fuel tanks, comes in. It was scrambled around 1pm to keep the allied strike force, made up of American and Australian F-35s and British Typhoons, in the air. The tanker's role is one of the most crucial in modern warfare, allowing the jets to fly longer distances and loiter over targets for longer without having to return to base. It climbs high and begins a series of loops in the air, far from the hostile red forces, but close enough for its more than 111 tonnes of fuel to keep the allies' aircraft in battle. “These are some of the best pilots in the US forces here to train against, and they mean business. It's not easy mode,” Voyager captain Flt Lt Winwood says. Somewhere above us is our escort of fighters whose job it is to watch over the vulnerable Voyager while it carries out the refuelling. An enemy fighter, thought to be a fifth-generation F-35B, gets within 50 miles of the Voyager's “danger zone” – the point at which it must start retreating. But it is shot down by our guardian. We survive, oblivious to how close the enemy came. Afterwards, officials debrief and watch a simulated replay of the day's warfare. “That's why we are so keen to train with partners and why training in this kind of environment is very important.” As we arrive back at base, the blue team colours are on top.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eight women call for full transparency from Trump administration in advert ahead of America's most-watched TV event Iona Cleave is a Foreign Breaking News Reporter at The Telegraph. Iona Cleave is a Foreign Breaking News Reporter at The Telegraph. “After years of being kept apart we're standing together,” the women said, while holding photos of their younger selves at the ages they were abused by Epstein. In unison, they added: “Because we all deserve the truth.” Earlier this week, Mr Trump – whose second term has been marred by his one-time friendship with Epstein – told Americans it was time to “move on” from the sex offender. On January 30, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) released three million pages related to their investigation into Epstein, including 2,000 videos and 180,000 images, under the Epstein Files Transparency Act. However, the DoJ's decision to hold back the other half of the approximate six million files has renewed concerns that some of Epstein's accomplices will not be held accountable and sparked further allegations over a cover-up. Their video ended with a call for the public to “stand with us” and “tell Attorney General Pam Bondi it's time for the truth”. His longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell was jailed in 2022 and is serving a 20-year prison for her role in helping him recruit underage victims. Members of Congress will be able to review the un-redacted files on computers at the justice department starting on Monday, according to a letter obtained by NBC News. The sporting spectacle's half-time show was performed by Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny completely in Spanish, despite fury from inside Maga at both his selection and refusal to bow to their demands to sing in English. The Latino artist, who has been vocal in his opposition to the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign, instead emphasised unity in a dance-filled spectacle that featured Lady Gaga as a surprise guest. He finished the show by holding up a football that said: “Together we are America”. The show also featured a young boy hugging Bad Bunny's Grammy Award, which he won three of last week. The child's involvement is believed to be a reference to five-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos, whose detainment by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Minnesota sparked a national outcry.</p>
