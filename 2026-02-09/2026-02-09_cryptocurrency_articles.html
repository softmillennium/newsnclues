                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin is now higher by 0.5% over the past 24 hours, with ether ETH$2,063.57, XRP XRP$1.4281 and solana SOL$85.45 ahead closer to 1.5% over the same time frame. "What we are experiencing is the weakest bitcoin bear case in its history," wrote Bernstein's Gautam Chhugani, reiterating the firm's $150,000 year-end price target on bitcoin. "When all stars are aligned, [the] Bitcoin community manufactures a self-imposed crisis of confidence," Chhugani continued. "Nothing blew up, no skeletons will unravel; [the] media is back again to write an obituary." "Time," said Chhugani, "remains a flat circle on Bitcoin." “Previous selloffs have usually bottomed near bitcoin's cost of production," said Ferraioli. "Miners with less efficient equipment will often shut down operations temporarily ... We can see this in real time by watching the mining difficulty adjustment — as more miners leave the network, difficulty falls. Once it starts to rise again, that is confirmation the bottom may be in." Indeed, CoinDesk reported earlier that bitcoin mining difficulty just dropped by its largest amount since 2021 as at least some miners did capitulate to plunging prices. Crypto platform Bullish (BLSH) is leading the sector higher on Monday with a 14..2% gain. Bitcoin miners who have pivoted to AI infrastructure are posting large gains as well as Morgan Stanley initiated positive coverage on TeraWulf (WULF) and Cipher Mining (CIFR) — both are up 14%.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's not clear what specific roles the pair will fill at Tempo. “Stablecoins are a generational opportunity,” Romero said on X. “Tempo is working on the most important problem in finance: building a global payments network that is fast, inexpensive and transparent,” Srinivasan said on X. Farcaster, which Romero and Srinivasan led for the past five years, was acquired last month by Neynar, a startup that builds tools for Farcaster developers, as it struggled to get the product to catch on with users. As part of the deal, Neynar took over the protocol's smart contracts, code repositories, mobile app and Clanker, an AI token launchpad. Romero, Srinivasan, and several employees at Merkle Manufactory, the firm behind Farcaster, stepped away from day-to-day development. Romero ran consumer business and international expansion as a vice president, while Srinivasan directed the crypto exchange's engineering and product teams. The project, backed by fintech giant Stripe and crypto venture firm Paradigm, added former Ethereum Foundation researcher Dankrad Feist to its ranks in October. Former Optimism Labs CEO Liam Horne and Rice University Professor Mallesh Pai also joined late last year. Tempo already counts over a dozen firms as partners, including Anthropic, Coupang, Deutsche Bank, DoorDash, Lead Bank, Mercury, Nubank, OpenAI, Revolut, Shopify, Standard Chartered, Visa, and Klarna. In December, the project rolled out its testnet ahead of a full launch scheduled for later this year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Publicly traded Ethereum treasury firm BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) added another 40,613 ETH valued around $83.2 million to its industry-leading Ethereum stash last week, despite its unrealized losses currently sitting near $7.5 billion. “BitMine has been steadily buying Ethereum, as we view this pullback as attractive, given the strengthening fundamentals,” Chairman Tom Lee said in a statement. The firm has remained committed to acquiring Ethereum as it falls further from its August all-time high mark of $4,946. The second-largest crypto asset by market cap has now dropped 10% in the last seven days of trading, recently changing hands at $2,123 after falling as low as $1,824 last week. That rebound might be the start of a major recovery effort though, according to Lee. A similar recovery is expected in 2026,” he said, adding that the “best investment opportunities” come after declines. The token will need a massive rebound in order to put BitMine back into the black on its purchases. The firm garnered an average acquisition cost of more than $4,000 per ETH on its first 3.7 million tokens, according to data from its latest quarterly report filed with the SEC. Adding in estimates from its acquisitions since November 30, BitMine currently sits on unrealized or paper losses of almost $7.5 billion, according to data from analytics platform DropStab. Shares of BMNR are up around 3.5% on Monday, changing hands around $21.18 despite ETH showing only a 1.5% gain in the last 24 hours.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump's relationship with cryptocurrency advocates has deteriorated as digital currency values decline and his administration falters on crypto legislation. According to Axios reporter Zachary Basu, members of the "hyper-online, male-dominated crypto space" who supported Trump's 2024 campaign are experiencing buyer's remorse. Initial enthusiasm has soured following Trump-branded meme coins that generated massive profits for insiders while leaving retail traders with worthless tokens. Complications intensified after revelations that the Trump family's crypto venture generated hundreds of millions in revenue, including through a secret investment by an Emirati royal. Axios reported, "Despite multiple factors driving bitcoin's downturn, the president once hailed as crypto's greatest ally has now become one of its most visible scapegoats." Runefelt subsequently added, "Yeah, trump was a reason for me to believe in $300k. At the end he was bad for crypto… Big mistake to have him as president." Another crypto investor, Bitcoin Teddy, sarcastically observed, "When Trump said we wouldn't have to pay taxes on crypto gains, I didn't realize he was removing the gains." While evidence remains unclear regarding whether crypto backlash will influence upcoming midterm elections, Axios notes a broader pattern: "The backlash captures a deeper problem for Trump: Niche and newly mobilized constituencies he courted in 2024 are growing disillusioned with his presidency."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Investors withdrew $187 million from digital asset products last week, but the pace of outflows has slowed significantly. Historically, these changes reveal crucial inflection points in investor sentiment. In its latest edition of Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report, CoinShares revealed that the latest price correction pushed total assets under management (AuM) down to $129.8 billion, the lowest level since the announcement of US tariffs in March 2025, which also coincided with a local low in asset prices. Trading activity surged last week, which drove exchange-traded product (ETP) volumes to a record-breaking $63.1 billion. The strong activity indicates increased investor interest and momentum. XRP continues to dominate year-to-date inflows, recording $109 million. Additionally, multi-asset products raked in $9.3 million over the past week. Price weakness continues as Bitcoin slipped to $69,000 on Sunday and has hovered near that level into Monday. Despite this, Bitget CMO Ignacio Aguirre Franco said that the crypto asset has a path to the $150,000-$180,000 range this year if ETF flows stabilize and macro conditions improve. Ongoing Layer 2 development and growing DeFi activity strengthen Ethereum's outlook, the exec said while predicting a potential target of $5,000-$6,000 with increased traditional finance participation. “Regulatory developments like the recent Clarity Bill and advancing market-structure legislation will also positively impact crypto markets by providing clearer compliance frameworks that reduce uncertainty and make these assets more attractive to institutions and traditional funds. As institutional capital finds easier entry points and global regulatory alignment improves, overall market stability and innovation are reinforced.” Chayanika has been working as a financial journalist for seven years.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The cryptocurrency industry went under intense pressure last week, with Bitcoin and Ethereum leading the crash and multiple cryptocurrencies hitting new multi-month lows. The interesting imbalance is relayed in Ethereum's performance relative to Bitcoin. A technical analysis of the ETH/BTC ratio shared on the social media platform X by Jonathan Carter indicates that Ethereum may be approaching a critical breakout point against Bitcoin, following an extended period of compression on the 2-week candlestick timeframe chart. According to technical analysis of the ETH/BTC 2-week chart, Ethereum is nearing an important point against Bitcoin after years of consolidation beneath a descending trendline. This long-running pattern originates from a major peak in relative valuation in July 2017, when 1 ETH was worth 0.154 BTC in Bitcoin terms, and has since formed a series of lower highs to form a falling resistance trendline. The lower boundary of this pattern is a long-tested support zone around 0.02 that has repeatedly drawn buying interest for Ethereum in relation to Bitcoin. However, the most recent 2-week candlestick has flipped green, and this development is important to the bullish outlook of Ethereum's performance against Bitcoin. If the pair can convincingly break above the descending triangle's upper trend boundary with sustained momentum, then this would allow Ethereum to enter a phase of sustained outperformance against Bitcoin. Crypto analyst Jonathan Carter outlined a series of potential upside targets should the ETH/BTC pair break free from its downward trend. Translating these ratio-based targets into absolute price levels is less straightforward, as the projections are based on Ethereum's performance relative to Bitcoin and not standalone price moves. Such a performance can happen in two major ways: either Ethereum receives more inflows than Bitcoin, or Bitcoin could crash more than Ethereum during a market-wide correction. Nonetheless, both scenarios will see the otherwise strong Bitcoin dominance dropping massively. CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc. All rights reserved.

("Bitmine" or the "Company") a Bitcoin and Ethereum Network company with a focus on the accumulation of crypto for long term investment, today announced Bitmine crypto + total cash + "moonshots" holdings totaling $10.0 billion. As of February 8th, 2026 at 3:00pm ET, the Company's crypto holdings are comprised of 4,325,738 ETH at $2,125 per ETH (NASDAQ: COIN), 193 Bitcoin (BTC), $200 million stake in Beast Industries, $19 million stake in Eightco Holdings (NASDAQ: ORBS) ("moonshots") and total cash of $595 million. "ETH prices declined -62% from 2025 highs, while Ethereum daily transactions hit an all-time high (ATH) of 2.5mm (per theblock.co) and active addresses soared in 2026 to an ATH of 1 million daily (per theblock.co)," said Thomas "Tom" Lee, Executive Chairman of Bitmine. Crypto prices are highly volatile, and in fact, this is the 8th time since 2018 that ETH prices have fallen 50% or more from a recent high, meaning declines like this are seen annually. The best investment opportunities in crypto have presented themselves after declines. "In the past week, we acquired 40,613 ETH," continued Lee. "Bitmine has staked more ETH than other entities in the world. At scale (when Bitmine's ETH is fully staked by MAVAN and its staking partners), the ETH staking rewards is $374 million annually (using 3.115% CESR), or greater than $1 million per day," stated Lee. "Annualized staking revenues are now $202 million, up +7% in the past week (see chart). The CESR (Composite Ethereum Staking Rate, administered by Quatrefoil) is 3.11%. We continue to make progress on our staking solution known as The Made in America VAlidator Network (MAVAN). Bitmine is currently working with 3 staking providers as the Company moves towards unveiling MAVAN in 2026," continued Lee. According to data from Fundstrat, the stock has traded average daily dollar volume of $1.3 billion (5-day average, as of February 6, 2026), ranking #107 in the US, behind Arista Networks (rank #106) and ahead of Monolithic Power Systems (rank #108) among 5,704 US-listed stocks (statista.com and Fundstrat research).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>India has again shown it prefers strict regulation over market freedom in the cryptocurrency sector. This dual-track strategy highlights India's intent to harness blockchain technology exclusively within state-controlled frameworks while discouraging speculative private trading. Recent reports suggest that over 72% of India's crypto trading volume has migrated to offshore platforms. This flight of capital has resulted in an estimated loss of billions in potential domestic tax revenue, as traders seek jurisdictions with more favorable tax environments. The Finance Bill 2026 adds new enforcement rules, focusing more on strict reporting than just collecting revenue. From April 1, 2026, anyone who does not report VDA transactions correctly will face serious financial penalties: Interestingly, the government has balanced these fines with a slight easing of criminal liability. The maximum jail term for TDS defaulters has been reduced from seven years to two years, suggesting a shift toward proportional punishment while maintaining high financial deterrents. As private crypto faces more limits, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is focusing more on the “e-Rupee.” This month, a new pilot for CBDC-based food coupons will start in Chandigarh and Puducherry. By keeping taxes and penalties high for private crypto, the government is limiting retail speculation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this interview, Ilya Tarutov, founder of Tramplin.io, looks back on a decade in crypto and pinpoints the moment the industry shifted from building long-term value to chasing attention. He unpacks how NFTs, meme coins, and high-leverage trading reshaped user behaviour, often at retail's expense. Tarutov also explains why he returned to product building after years as an investor, outlines Tramplin.io's premium staking model on Solana, and shares his view on what crypto must change to rebuild trust and re-engage everyday users. People genuinely believed they were changing the world. Projects have started focusing on liquidity instead of creating value. Memes have become the primary way people get into crypto, expecting 50–100x leverage. Back then, you could believe in a project and hold it long-term. Now, most people just end up becoming exit liquidity for someone quicker. I saw this play out cycle after cycle from 2021 to 2025, and that's exactly why I wanted to build something that gives a real chance to any user without putting their hard-earned capital at risk. Invezz: After years of avoiding building products, what made this idea, to create Tramplin.io, impossible to ignore, and why launch now? Investing has become my full-time job, and I was watching startups sort of from the outside. But this idea just kept coming back to me. So we built it, and during testing, we received great feedback reaffirming our belief that this product is what the market needs. Then we realised we'd accidentally recreated the model of the UK's Premium Bonds, which is a popular product with millions of users and billions invested in it in the UK alone. Just look at what's going on in the community right now. There's a huge demand for something honest and safe, but with the thrill of possibility. Our team came together around the idea and built it. Invezz: What is Tramplin.io, and how does it differ from standard native staking on Solana? Usually, staking provides a predictable 5–7% APY (shared proportionally), which is basically “coffee money” for small amounts. Invezz: You describe the model as “premium staking.” What does “premium” actually mean in this context, especially for someone staking a small amount? This layer introduces an additional opportunity, but it does not work as a VIP service. Users still delegate SOL via regular staking and do not put their capital at risk. In traditional staking, rewards are paid proportionally to stake size, which can feel very insignificant for small accounts with balances. With Tramplin.io, a portion of the yield is redistributed as random, larger payouts. We make no promises of extra yield or fixed returns. The distribution happens under transparent, verifiable on-chain rules, and every user has access to this data. The approach does follow the same principle as UK Premium Bonds: there might be some time without any yield, but if there's a reward, it can be significantly higher than standard APY. And I think it's important to mention that the original capital is always preserved. Invezz: DeFi often promises high APYs without clarity. What does “honest yield” mean in practice for Tramplin.io? “Honest yield” means the source is clear, transparent, and doesn't rely on endless new money or hidden risks. Just a real chance to get more than standard staking without illusions of fixed returns and without risking users' money. We never have access to the funds; there's no custody. They can open any compatible wallet like Phantom or Backpack, check their stake, and withdraw it, following regular Solana rules. Everything is built so that even in the worst-case scenario, users keep their funds. We looked at wallets holding 1–100 SOL (that's typical retail size): our data showed about 2 million wallets holding SOL without staking. Only around 560,000 wallets in that range actually stake. Regular staking gives tiny rewards of $2-5 a month that don't (usually) motivate people. After what the industry has experienced through 2021-2025, folks are scared of risky alternatives, so they just sit on their SOL. That's a huge amount of idle capital: millions of people believe in Solana but aren't actually participating in the network. Give them a safe, engaging way to join, and they'll start participating. Invezz: From your perspective, what's the most realistic way to bring new users into the Solana ecosystem, and how can products like Tramplin.io help make that onboarding stick? The most realistic way to attract new people to Solana isn't hype or quick “get-rich” schemes; it's making crypto feel like traditional finance, but faster, easier, more accessible, and more meaningful. Solana is already leading here: it provides instant transactions, low fees, and user-friendly wallets like Phantom or Backpack, even for total beginners. But to keep people engaged after their first try, you need products with a familiar TradFi-like experience, not casino vibes. Invezz: What do you think the crypto industry is missing right now, and what kind of crypto culture are you trying to bring back? The industry is missing responsibility and real respect for users. Then crypto became a place where most products either don't solve any real problems or are built to make money quickly and leave. The culture where small users don't feel left out and have a real shot to participate. That's what I want to see and build.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum (ETH +1.76%) might be on the verge of making major inroads into being a provider of artificial intelligence (AI) agent infrastructure in crypto. If it succeeds, it would likely see a lot more demand for its coin, and a lot more automated activity on its chain, both of which would boost its price. In the tech world, if an organization can define certain coding practices as the standard for implementing a feature on one of its platforms, it's effectively able to shape the entire ecosystem. Aside from training developers to work on your platform, thereby expanding your talent pool, setting a standard is a prime way to demonstrate technical leadership and build prestige. And that's exactly what Ethereum is angling to do with its new ERC-8004 standard, which is intended to guide the development of AI agents that operate on its chain and others. It also specifies an off-chain file where an agent can report its metadata, as well as a way for third parties to submit feedback that smart contracts can then read. Basically, ERC-8004 is a new standard that defines an ID system and review framework for AI agents. That framework calls for gathering data on each AI agent's name, skills, and track record for completing its assigned tasks. The strategic vision here is that once AI agents can discover each other on the blockchain and prove their identity and competence to each other, it will open the door to a flourishing market for AI services that settle in Ethereum. If ERC-8004 becomes widely adopted, it could bring a lot more traffic to Ethereum, as it will be the network with the clearest framework for AI agents to operate within. More sustained traffic can translate into more transaction fees burned, which can support Ethereum's price, as agents will need to be supplied with Ether (or work to generate it themselves) before they can perform any independent tasks. But there are two caveats that may mean the rollout of this new standard isn't a slam dunk for holders. First, developers abiding by the practices described in an ERC is optional. Second, Ethereum keeps pushing down its gas fees with each successive upgrade it performs. So Ethereum can get tons more usage while generating lower fees and thus constraining the returns for holders. So the new ERC-8004 standard is promising, but it's not exactly a reason to run and buy Ethereum hand over fist. Wait for people to actually start using the standard in a way that demonstrably generates more demand for the coin before getting more aggressive with your purchasing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Digital Rupee, designated as e₹, represents a pivotal advancement in India's monetary system, embodying the nation's transition toward a comprehensive Central Bank Digital Currency framework. This initiative reflects India's commitment to maintaining monetary sovereignty while embracing technological modernization in financial services. This statutory foundation ensures that e₹ carries the same legal weight and acceptance obligations as traditional currency, creating binding obligations for acceptance by all entities within the Indian financial ecosystem. The regulatory framework governing e₹ operations establishes comprehensive oversight mechanisms ensuring compliance with existing monetary laws while accommodating the unique characteristics of digital currency systems. The Digital Rupee operates through a sophisticated technological infrastructure designed to facilitate seamless integration with existing banking systems while maintaining operational independence. Users access e₹ through dedicated applications provided by authorized financial institutions, creating a secure digital environment for currency storage and transaction processing. The system architecture ensures continuous availability, enabling users to conduct transactions, load funds, and manage their digital wallets beyond conventional banking hours. This twenty-four-hour operational capacity represents a significant advancement over traditional banking limitations, enhancing user convenience and financial accessibility. The technological framework incorporates advanced security protocols to protect user data and financial assets against cyber threats. These security measures include encrypted transaction processing, secure wallet management, and comprehensive fraud prevention systems that maintain the integrity of the digital currency ecosystem. Unlike traditional payment interfaces that merely facilitate fund transfers between bank accounts, e₹ functions as both a payment mechanism and a store of value, providing users with enhanced financial flexibility. This functionality allows for the establishment of usage restrictions based on temporal, geographical, or purpose-specific criteria, creating opportunities for targeted financial policy implementation and enhanced transaction control. The Digital Rupee platform prioritises user experience through intuitive interface design and comprehensive accessibility features. The system supports multiple device platforms, ensuring broad compatibility across various technological environments and user preferences. The elimination of minimum balance requirements for e₹ wallets removes traditional banking barriers, promoting financial inclusion across diverse economic segments. The platform's design philosophy emphasises simplicity and efficiency, enabling users to perform complex financial operations through straightforward digital interfaces. This approach reduces the learning curve associated with digital currency adoption while maintaining sophisticated underlying functionality. The Digital Rupee occupies a unique position within India's financial ecosystem, distinguishing itself from existing payment. While traditional digital payment platforms facilitate transactions between existing bank accounts, e₹ represents actual digital currency holdings that can be stored, transferred, and utilized independently of conventional banking relationships. This fundamental distinction creates new possibilities for financial interaction, enabling direct peer-to-peer value transfer without intermediary banking infrastructure. The Digital Rupee incorporates comprehensive security measures designed to protect user assets and maintain system integrity. These protective measures ensure that user funds remain secure, building confidence in digital currency adoption. This proactive approach to security management reflects the critical importance of user trust in digital currency success. The ability to track digital currency circulation provides enhanced visibility into monetary flows, potentially improving the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policy interventions. The programmable nature of e₹ creates opportunities for targeted economic stimulus measures and conditional spending programs, enabling more precise policy implementation than traditional monetary tools. These capabilities may prove particularly valuable in addressing specific economic challenges or promoting particular policy objectives. By entering the email address you agree to our Privacy Policy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In case you missed it, 5 February 2026, is the day when most of the remaining provisions of DUAA entered into force. A swathe of provisions got the green light, including the new approach to ADM, which unless special category data is involved, moves to a permission but with safeguards regime, meaning certain decisions may no longer be subject to the more severe restrictions on automated decision-making. (For more information see the ADM section of our article here). You may want to take advantage of the new test when completing your Transfer Risk Assessments (TRAs) for transfers from the UK but there is no urgency to review existing TRAs as they will remain fit for purpose. (For more information see the Data Transfers section in our article here). Also in force are the remaining amendments to the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (PECR), including the headline grabbing UK GDPR level fines (i.e. maximum £17.5 million or 4% of global annual turnover, whichever is higher), the extension of the cookie consent rules to anyone who "instigates" the storage or access to stored data, wider enforcement powers for PECR breaches, soft opt-in for charities, the relaxation of exemptions for cookie consent where they pose a low risk to user privacy and the ICO's task of encouraging industry to produce codes of conduct. We know the ICO is very active when it comes to PECR breaches so anyone taking a risk based view on PECR requirements particularly in respect of marketing campaigns should be reconsidering their risk profile given the stakes have become significantly higher for non-compliance! The remaining data rights, bar one, are also commenced, clarifying time limits for responding to data subjects' requests, the information to be provided to data subjects and fees and reasons for responses to data subjects' requests about law enforcement processing. (For more information see the Data Rights section of our article here). This right will come into force on 19 June 2026 so if you haven't already reviewed your complaints process, worked out how to resource it given the likely increase in direct complaints and revised your privacy notices, the clock is ticking with little over 4 months to get your house in order. Keep an eye out for the ICO's final guidance too, which is still expected Winter 2025/2026 (even if we are now, thank goodness, through the 2025 part of Winter!) (For more information see the IC's new powers section of our article here). Again, if you haven't already familiarised yourself with the powers, it would be prudent to do so as these will change how the ICO currently conducts its investigations. (For more information see the relevant sections of our article here). We don't think either provision will have a huge impact on organisations, rather they provide welcome clarity and for most of us the legitimate interests assessment (LIA) will still be necessary, unless you fall within the narrow scope of the new "recognised legitimate interests". (For more information see the IC section of our article here). It remains to be seen when the Information Commission will come into being but with appointments to the new Board well underway it might be sooner, rather than later. As it was third time lucky before data reform was enacted in the UK, many compliance teams preferred to wait until DUAA received Royal Assent and there was certainty about the road ahead. Now with the majority of provisions in force the direction of travel is clear, so if you haven't already refreshed your policies and privacy notices, considered your TRAs for transfers from the UK, discussed what the ADM changes mean for your organisation, what the new PECR reforms mean for your marketing strategy, how the new ICO powers will impact your approach to regulatory investigations etc. If you have any questions about these changes, how to implement them for your business or would like training/a workshop for your team please do reach out to your usual LS contact.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gone are the days of digital currency via a blockchain network being propagated by dark web aficionados. Rather than banner-waving crypto-bros lauded as economic oracles of an underground powerhouse, cryptocurrency has become quite the complicated it girl in market restructuring. Yet, it currently struggles to coexist with regulatory systems designed for traditional finance. As Congress works to fold in a less volatile digital currency market, it also disrupts a subaltern commerce culture. Given its original promise of decentralization—which means monetary activities freed from the clutches of centralized banking systems—crypto sits in a political quandary. Because of its salience in the market, the tension in how to shift from an unregulated to regulated monetary system was a theoretical possibility. Today, it is a legislative, cultural, and economic practice. At the center of crypto's existential crisis is Coinbase. Initially, Coinbase served as a simple, consumer on-ramp for buying, selling and converting Bitcoin. If passed, the bill to establish “a regulatory framework for digital commodities,” would be landmark legislation. “We'd rather have no bill than a bad bill,” Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said, explaining the company's position. A cryptocurrency backed by Coinbase, Stablecoins aim to reduce the volatility by offering price stability with a digital token backed by the same equivalent in cash or equivalent reserves. The company's objection was not to oversight itself, but to provisions it argued would lock crypto into a restrictive framework. Armstrong warned that the legislation could be “materially worse than the status quo,” citing limits on tokenized assets, privacy-preserving finance, and especially stablecoin rewards. It also sent a clear message to Washington. As one of the foremost leaders in fintech, its stance said that regulatory clarity alone is insufficient when it comes at the cost of future innovation. By using Base, its cultural arm of digital currency, Coinbase is no longer reacting to regulation and adoption, it actively shapes them with a powerful triumvirate—policy, coded programs and a belief system. By taking that stance publicly, Coinbase reframed its role. Instead of quietly lobbying for incremental changes, it positioned itself as a long-term steward of the crypto economy, willing to absorb short-term uncertainty to avoid long-term damage. Nowhere is Coinbase's philosophy clearer than in its defense of stablecoins. Stablecoins are often treated as background infrastructure, useful but unremarkable. In its view, stablecoins are the connective tissue between crypto and everyday economic life, powering payments, savings, payroll, remittances, and on-chain commerce. One of the company's major concerns with the Clarity Act was what multiple reports described as provisions that could effectively “kill rewards on stablecoins.” For Coinbase, that was not a minor detail. It struck at the heart of how digital dollars can compete with, and improve upon, traditional banking products. Armstrong has previously argued that consumers deserve better outcomes from financial innovation. “Consumers deserve a bigger piece of the pie,” he said in earlier commentary on stablecoin interest, noting that on-chain yields could “force us all to up our game for the ultimate benefit of consumers.” In that light, Coinbase's resistance to restrictive stablecoin rules is less about corporate profit and more about defining who benefits from the next financial system, big boy institutions or common folk? That means it is a secondary framework or protocol built on top of an existing blockchain (Layer 1) to significantly increase transaction speed, scalability, and reduce fees. Yet, in practice, it is becoming a social financial layer where identity, content, and capital intersect. On Base, profiles double as wallets, and posts become assets. Value no longer flows only upward to platforms. It can accrue sideways, and sometimes directly, to individuals. This shift introduces a powerful idea: personal market cap. In crypto-native social environments, a person's reputation, consistency, and community can translate into on-chain demand. People are no longer just users generating data for platforms. Coinbase is not trying to be just another bank with 4 plus percent yield nor simply another instagramish social network. It is building the infrastructure where banking, markets, and social identity converge. As the Clarity Act is in limbo, now industry persons know when Coinbase enters the regulation area, lawmakers acknowledge how it builds; how it engages developers; and the ways in which Base creators experiment. The question is no longer whether crypto will be regulated or adopted. Moving forward, the question will be, “what's your market cap?” And not just the market capitalization (market cap or value) of a company or a token, but your personal valuation in the crypto economy. Whether it involves the Base blockchain or other emerging currencies, your involvement is crucial, whether it pertains to the Base blockchain or other emerging cryptocurrencies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Instead of helping Wilkerson, court records show Martin instead helped herself to his cash, moving money from his accounts and buying bitcoin. They trusted Martin to manage the money, considering her an adopted family member. "Every box for trustworthiness seemed to be checked there, and so she seemed to be the perfect person," said Puryear. "She seemed like the perfect person on paper. The first sign of trouble came in August 2020, when the nursing home where Wilkerson was living called to say they had not been paid in months, and $41,000 was owed immediately. Puryear started looking into what happened with Wilkerson's finances. Wilkerson had saved plenty and now was facing a new battle after all he sacrificed. "He's a Tuskegee Airmen, World War II veteran, just an all-around wonderful person," said Puryear. Wilkerson made history as one of America's first Black military pilots. After the military, Wilkerson flew for fun and became a Chicago-based radio technician. He married, never had kids, and saved for his golden years. Puryear reached out to Martin about the missing funds, but wasn't getting an answer from her. "She attempted to dodge and evade, like apparently she'd been doing for some number of months at that point, and she didn't seem to have the time to return a phone call over such an important thing," said Puryear. "You'd think, if she was innocent, that would have caused her to want to communicate right away, but she didn't." "All of her actions, they shock the conscience." Court documents show 11 withdrawals over 18 months, with Martin shutting down accounts and pocketing more than $245,000, moving most of her new wealth into hard-to-track bitcoin. "Probation and a felony conviction for that sort of theft from that sort of a victim just is not quite enough," said Puryear. Puryear, an attorney, filed a lawsuit on Wilkerson's behalf to get his money back, accusing Martin of stealing more than $380,000. During that case, Martin repeatedly failed to show up for court hearings. The judge ordered her to halt all transactions, but court documents show she ignored that, too, and moved more money. "It makes me wonder what is wrong in Patricia's heart that she would do that to somebody," said Puryear. Martin appealed the lawsuit judgment and had it overturned, in part because Wilkerson died. She lost her law license because of all this, admitting: "… the evidence would clearly and convincingly establish the facts and conclusions of misconduct." Wilkerson's care never suffered due to Martin's theft, but for a man whose legacy is etched in history, the moves of Martin are etched in the minds of those who loved him most. "Lawton was such a fine man; one of the finest people I have ever met in my life," said Puryear. "And Patricia Martin is one of the absolute worst humans, and to see that contrast between them is breathtaking." Martin declined to speak with CBS News Chicago for this story. The former judge continues to draw her government pension.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek's goal with ai.com is to build “a decentralized network of autonomous, self-improving AI agents that perform real-world tasks for the good of humanity.” Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek has officially launched his new website, ai.com, to the public, allowing users to create personal AI agents that can perform everyday tasks on their behalf. For now, users can register their ai.com username handles, but must then wait in a queue to have their private, personalized AI agents spun out for them. Marszalek said his mission with ai.com is to accelerate artificial general intelligence “by building a decentralized network of autonomous, self-improving AI agents that perform real-world tasks for the good of humanity.” ChatGPT creator OpenAI launched an enterprise-focused AI agent platform, Frontier, last week, while software engineer Peter Steinberger released AI agent OpenClaw in November 2025, which gained popularity in January. Pseudonymous crypto and AI researcher 0xSammy said the move resembles how Marszalek scaled Crypto.com to over 150 million customers by buying a popular domain and investing heavily in marketing: Related: Crypto PACs secure massive war chests ahead of US midterms These tech companies reportedly paid around $8 million to run 30-second advertisements during the Super Bowl.
