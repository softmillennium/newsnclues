                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Banks has become a regular starter this season for Augsburg at age 19. The 6-foot-4 defender is considered one of the best American defensive prospects in many years and has earned one U.S. men's national team call-up. "I saw him playing in Germany, and he's a massive talent," USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino said after naming Banks to his roster for September friendlies against South Korea and Japan. Banks did not participate in either match and wasn't called up for the USMNT's remaining four matches last fall. That lack of experience may end up proving costly for Banks' World Cup hopes. "So we're going to start the World Cup with somebody that doesn't have a single minute playing for the U.S. men's national team? Lalas was responding to co-host Stu Holden, who tipped Banks for a potential World Cup spot. "He has great size," the former USMNT midfielder said. He has a lot of tools that I don't see anywhere else in the center back pool." "According to Pochettino, it's as if the World Cup just started," he said. "So I want the best 11 playing in whatever formation it is that you believe we are going to play in the World Cup. "And so I don't understand what leads Stu or others to believe that Pochettino is going to have this player that nobody has seen actually play for the U.S. before not only be there, but in many cases start." Lalas added: "I'm excited about Noahkai Banks, don't get me wrong.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GOAL breaks down the key moments from USWNT players abroad, including Thompson getting back in form. While the result itself was headline-worthy, Coffey's increased involvement stood out, as her developing chemistry alongside Yui Hasegawa added a new American dimension to City's midfield. From highlight-reel saves to goals, growing roles, and statement results, it was a weekend that showcased the expanding impact of USWNT players across the WSL. GOAL takes a closer look at how USWNT players fared across Europe over the weekend. Thompson was on the scoresheet again as Chelsea earned a weekend win, adding to what has been a productive WSL campaign for the American attacker. Across all competitions for Chelsea, Thompson now has eight goals to her name. Arsenal's statement win over Manchester City came with plenty of talking points, and Fox was quietly central to the result and all of the points. Tasked with managing one of the league's most dangerous attacks, from Khadija Shaw to Kerolin,Fox delivered a composed, disciplined performance on the outside back spot. It was the kind of performance that doesn't always dominate highlight reels but absolutely shapes outcomes - a reminder of why Fox has become such a trusted presence in Arsenal's back line. The American goalkeeper delivered another assured performance in United's weekend victory over Leicester City, producing six saves to preserve a clean sheet and reinforce the defensive confidence in her backline. Tullis-Joyce's command of the box, shot-stopping ability, and growing composure under pressure turned what could have been a tricky afternoon into a controlled one and another victory for United this year. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Man City didn't get the result they wanted, but Coffey's latest WSL minutes continued to show why her arrival matters a lot in the middle. In a high-leverage matchup against Arsenal, Coffey brought steadiness to City's midfield moments. She was ultimately tidy in possession, positionally sharp, and took on the not-so-glamorous part of the game, bodying up Kim Little and Mariona Caldentey. Even so, Coffey's presence offered another snapshot of what she can add to the middle.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Academics from the University of Sheffield are warning that current gambling advertising rules may be insufficient after new research revealed that television gambling ads significantly influenced betting activity during the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The findings, published in Addictive Behaviors Reports, show that the frequency of football betting was between 16% and 24% higher during matches broadcast on channels carrying gambling advertising, compared with games shown on channels without such ads. Although participants reported no personal history of gambling problems, men and individuals aged 18–44 are known to disproportionately make up the largest group of sports bettors in the U.K. and are also at the greatest risk of gambling-related harm. Gambling is widely recognized as a public health issue, with associated health, social and economic costs in England alone estimated at between £1.05 and £1.77 billion per year. Lead author of the study, Ellen McGrane, Research Associate at the University of Sheffield's School of Medicine and Population health, said, "These television ads may be acting as powerful triggers during live games, encouraging betting even among people who had no prior intention to gamble. "One of our key findings was that this advertising doesn't simply shift people between betting platforms, it increases the overall amount of gambling taking place. A substantial body of evidence shows that when gambling participation rises at a population level, gambling-related harm also increases, suggesting that the current restrictions in place may not be effective enough. "Despite the scale of this issue, advertising rules are not being strengthened. Tighter regulation of gambling advertising during live sport may be needed, particularly ahead of highly televised events such as the World Cup, to better protect those most at risk." However, no changes have been made to gambling advertising regulations. The research points to approaches already in place in several European countries, where policies restrict gambling advertising around live football broadcasts, as potential models for reform.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Foxborough vs. FIFA and the Kraft Group is underway. The Town of Foxborough reaffirmed Monday morning that it is not going to front the $7.8 million it will cost to provide necessary safety and security measures for the seven World Cup games coming to Kraft family-owned Gillette Stadium this summer. Yukna said the town was supposed to learn on Jan. 30 about its grant request but is still waiting. “Our issue quite honestly is grants don't really work for us in the sense of timing,” said Yukna. Yukna said the town is not allowed to discuss specific security measures and requirements from FIFA and security partners the town is working with, other than to say they are “enhanced” needs and are not used for standard security operations for sports events and concerts. “We told them that if we don't have a completed lease resolved and signatures on both sides by March 17, then the town will not issue a license,” said Yukna. We believe it is reasonable and appropriate that FIFA and/or event partners provide the funding necessary to support the public safety and operational requirements that come with hosting these matches.” The town's 2026 fiscal year operating budget is $102,338,412, with $13 million budgeted for public safety. FIFA, soccer's governing body, estimates revenues from the expanded 48-country event to be held in 16 North American cities will top $11 billion. Based on FIFA's revised 2024 budget, its expenses and investments this year will total close to $6.4 billion. The Boston 26 committee charged with staging the event is a nonprofit that does not receive funding from FIFA. Its approximately $100 million budget is funded through state, federal, and private investments. Foxborough and Boston are expected to apply for and receive a large portion of the $47 million allocated to Massachusetts. Foxborough's statement said that it is working “collaboratively with FIFA, Boston Soccer, Kraft Sports and Entertainment, the Commonwealth, and our public safety partners to prepare for the 2026 FIFA World Cup” and that the games represent an “exciting opportunity for the region. “At the same time, hosting an event of this scale creates significant public safety, operational, and infrastructure demands on the host community. Our police, fire, emergency communications, public works, and municipal staff will be responsible for ensuring the safety of tens of thousands of visitors while also maintaining essential services for our residents and businesses.” The town has spent many months working with event organizers and public safety professionals to identify the resources required to host these matches. Those efforts have made clear that the associated municipal costs are substantial. Last Friday, a spokesperson for Governor Maura Healey said, in part: “We are committed to ensuring that municipalities, especially Foxborough, have the support they need to make this a successful event through state, federal, and private funds.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA officials were in town this week for the Super Bowl, and host committee CEO Zaileen Janmohamed said she was “hopeful” about the region's chances. “Personally, I want to bring a women's event here — that would be really meaningful to me,” Janmohamed said after Monday morning's news conference passing the Super Bowl torch to next year's host, Los Angeles. “We'll see how that goes, but we saw what happened this week when an event comes into this market. This place is awesome in hosting an event.” This is a very complicated event, and she did it. According to York, the 49ers' CEO, the Super Bowl generated “about $500 million” in economic impact around the region and brought in visitors who accounted for more than 100,000 room nights in local hotels. “If we can't host a Super Bowl next year, we might as well keep it on the best coast,” York said. The Niners are ready to get after it. With Super Bowl 61 coming to Los Angeles, it will mark the fourth time in NFL history that separate cities in the same state have hosted the game in consecutive years. The Men's World Cup will also play matches at two venues in California, and Los Angeles is set to host the Summer Olympics in 2028. Janmohamed intends to keep the Bay Area as a prominent player for big events. “Close some things off with the NFL, make sure we transition really well, and by next week, we'll be back at it and starting to go full-steam ahead on the World Cup.” Janmohamed said she met with FIFA officials on Saturday. A formal announcement awarding the tournament is expected in April, with cities and venues announced after that. “I think what FIFA wants to make sure of is that the Women's World Cup isn't necessarily just a replication of the Men's World Cup,” Janmohamed said. “There's different cities in the country that might not have been considered for a Men's World Cup. So I actually have no idea how it's going to play out. Obviously, the Bay is an important market for them. They have a lot of sponsors that are based out here.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Next summer, the FIFA World Cup is going to be held in over a dozen other cities across the United States, Canada and Mexico, including a semi-final in Mercedes-Benz Stadium. During the Club World Cup in July, FIFA President Gianni Infantino and President Trump colluded to hold the group draw for next year's World Cup in Washington D.C, where Trump would have easy access to the massive event to bring public attention to himself. In 2015, seven FIFA higher ups were arrested in Switzerland on corruption charges, which kicked off a year long saga where five more FIFA officials were arrested and the then President of FIFA, Sepp Blatter, resigned. This would prove to be true, as during the draw on Dec. 5, Trump was awarded the brand-new “FIFA Peace Prize”. Trump was gifted a medal and gold trophy for the honor, claiming he had stopped 8 wars in 10 months. Infantino has visited Trump publicly more than he has visited any other national leader or soccer official. In contrast, he only visited Trump's successor/predescessor Joe Biden twice, and he has not yet visited Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, and met with Mexican President Claudia Finebaum for the first time in August. Trump's political actions have caused an indirect impact on the world cup. African media and fans have expressed nervousness about attending the World Cup in America due to the recent immigration raids by ICE also causing problems for tourists. Trump has indefinitely frozen visas from 14 qualifying nations, including Brazil, the most successful team in World Cup history, and 2022 semi-finalist Morocco. While Trump has promised that teams and media will get exemptions from these restrictions, no indication has been given about whether spectators will be afforded the same luxury. Infantino's close relationship with Trump can easily be a cause for concern as an additional issue looming over the head of the World Cup is Trump's crackdown on crime across numerous major cities in America. The federal government has deployed national guard troops to several cities across the nation, including World Cup host city Los Angeles. Trump has claimed that he can move the games of the World Cup away from cities he has deemed dangerous, such as Seattle, Boston and Los Angeles. While FIFA Vice President Victor Montagliani initially pushed back against these claims, FIFA later stated that they would leave matters of safety and security wholly to the governments of the three host nations. Moving games on such a short notice would be extremely detrimental to any travelling fans, as well as teams and officials who make the journey across the world to compete in the World Cup. The federal government, on the other hand, is overstepping its hand and trying to control elements of the tournament that are traditionally run by FIFA, and it is likely that FIFA will let them.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. men's national team boss Mauricio Pochettino revealed he assured President Donald Trump that the Stars and Stripes can win the 2026 FIFA World Cup, unfolding largely on home soil. The Argentine manager, who took over the USMNT in September 2024, sat down on the High Performance Podcast and opened up about a brief encounter with President Trump at the 2026 World Cup draw back in December. “At the draw of the World Cup, I met Donald Trump for a few minutes. He asked me, ‘What do you think, coach. The Stars and Stripes received a favorable draw for the competition, matching up against Paraguay, Australia and one of Türkiye, Romania, Slovakia or Kosovo in Group D. With the “massive boost” of the home crowd, Pochettino is confident in his team's chances of making a deep run in the tournament. After initial struggles under the new leadership of Pochettino, the USMNT hit its stride to close out 2025. The Stars and Stripes ended the year on a five-game unbeaten run, tallying victories over Japan, Australia, Paraguay and Uruguay. Even more impressive is that the team accomplished the streak without some of its best players. The opponents waiting for Pochettino's men in March and June, though, present an entirely different challenge. During the March international window, the USMNT is set to face off with Belgium and reigning UEFA Nations League winners Portugal. Then in June, the Stars and Stripes' final two matches before the World Cup come against newly crowned AFCON champions Senegal and Germany. Going against such top competition will be the real barometer of the USMNT's title credentials. Sure, the team has proven it can defeat Concacaf, CONMEBOL and Oceania opposition, but it will likely need to get past European and African giants if it wants to make history this summer. When Pochettino took charge of the USMNT, he signed a two-year contract that will take him through the 2026 World Cup. Should the Stars and Stripes perform well this summer, U.S. Soccer would likely want to lock down his future. Pochettino quickly added he “doesn't know” for which club. The desire to hoist the most prestigious trophy in Europe is no surprise considering it alluded him during his time at Spurs, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea. But it also poses the question: Does Pochettino have plans to return to Europe following the World Cup? A poor performance at the World Cup on home soil could propel the Argentine back to Europe, leaving the Stars and Stripes once again in another transitional period.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Something special is unfolding in France's top soccer division, and at the heart of it stands the Alabama-born godson of a famous college football coach. Since then, he has started six of eight and substituted into the other two. A talented soccer player and football kicker, Tessmann planned to play both sports at Clemson. Before enrolling, however, he signed a homegrown contract with FC Dallas. His soccer path has taken him to two of Europe's top five leagues — Italy's Serie A in 2021-22 before relegation and France's Ligue 1 the past two seasons — and up the U.S. ladder. Since playing every minute of four Olympic matches in France, he has integrated into Mauricio Pochettino's senior squad. With World Cup veteran Tyler Adams recovering from a knee injury, Tessmann's role could grow this spring. Pochettino is expected to summon him for the friendlies in late March against Belgium and Portugal in Atlanta — just a two-hour drive from Uncle Bo. Wing back Tim Weah (90 poor minutes) was part of fourth-place Olympique Marseille's 5-0 embarrassment against the new front-runner, Paris Saint-Germain. Forward Christian Pulisic and second-place AC Milan were off this weekend and, with the Winter Olympics leaving their home stadium unavailable, they will play their third consecutive away match Friday at Pisa. Midfielder Yunus Musah and Atalanta will host Cremonese on Monday. In the second division, Jonathan Klinsmann earned his first clean sheet since Nov. 28, a span of 10 matches, as Cesena defeated Pescara 2-0. In his first start since late November, winger Alex Zendejas scored a marvelous goal on his 28th birthday as Club América edged Monterrey 1-0. A leg injury had sidelined him for the first four Liga MX Clausura matches before entering as a sub in the CONCACAF Champions Cup on Wednesday. Center back Chris Richards went the distance as Crystal Palace won at Brighton 1-0, ending a 12-game winless streak in all competitions since mid-December. Left back Antonee Robinson didn't play in Fulham's 2-1 loss to Everton, the first match he has sat out since his long-awaited return from injury in mid-December. Presumably he will return for Wednesday's visit to second-place Manchester City. Midfielder Brenden Aaronson logged 78 minutes as Leeds rebounded from a four-goal loss at front-running Arsenal with a 3-1 victory over Nottingham Forest, staying six points above the relegation zone. Striker Haji Wright's scoreless streak hit three during a 90-minute effort in Coventry City's 0-0 home draw with Oxford. Nevertheless, with two teams assured promotion, Coventry holds a five-point cushion over third-place Ipswich Town. Midfielder Aidan Morris is expected to start for Middlesbrough, which will visit Coventry next Monday. Forward Patrick Agyemang made his 21st consecutive start for Derby County in a 2-1 loss to Ipswich Town. Mönchengladbach midfielder Gio Reyna missed his third consecutive match with a muscle injury, while right wing back Joe Scally was a 79th-minute substitute. Midfielder James Sands made his 16th straight start as next-to-last St. Pauli surprised Stuttgart, 2-1. Defender Noahkai Banks played the first half of Augsburg's 2-0 loss at Mainz. Forward Damion Downs' scoreless streak since joining Hamburg on loan from Southampton hit 271 minutes after playing the second half of a 2-0 victory at Heidenheim. In the second division, left back John Tolkin logged 90 in Holstein Kiel's 3-1 loss at Hannover, its third straight setback to leave it two points safe of the relegation playoffs. Right back Sergiño Dest played all of PSV Eindhoven's 2-1 comeback victory at Groningen, stretching the leaders' streak in the Eredivisie to 16-0-2 since Sept. 13 and 19-1-2 overall. Center back Auston Trusty went 120 minutes as Celtic outlasted Dundee 2-1 in the Scottish Cup's round of 16. Atletico Madrid midfielder Johnny Cardoso missed his second consecutive match with a muscle injury. … Wing back Alex Freeman will seek to make his Villarreal debut Monday against Espanyol.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a season that exceeded almost everyone's expectations, the Patriots lost Super Bowl 60 to the Seattle Seahawks by a score of 29-13. Drake Maye and the Pats' offense struggled to get anything going against Seattle's relentless defense. "I'd like to go back to the beginning and redo it," Maye said after the game, adding that the tough loss will be motivation for next year. In between the action, Bad Bunny's much-anticipated halftime show was a festive homage to Puerto Rico — with nearly as many celebrity cameos as Dunkin's "Good Will Hunting" parody commercial. (You can watch the performance in full here.) Meanwhile back in Foxborough: Just over four months from the start of the World Cup, town officials in Foxborough are threatening to withhold a necessary entertainment license for matches at Gillette Stadium — unless they get their money first. During a meeting last week, Foxborough Select Board Chair Bill Yukna said they've requested $7.7 million to pay for local security costs, and they want it all upfront before they grant the license. "This is a national — international — event, and it's not up to the town of Foxborough to support or pay for any of this." On the T: The Green Line has resumed normal service this morning after a trolley derailed yesterday afternoon at Park Street and ripped up a bit of the platform.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ronaldo hasn't played any part in Al-Nassr's most recent two games in the Saudi Pro League amid reports he was unhappy with the way the club is being funded, particularly after watching rival Al-Hilal sign Karim Benzema in last month's transfer window. Al-Nassr, Al-Hilal, Al-Ittihad and Al-Ahli are all majority owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. “Cristiano has been fully engaged with Al-Nassr since his arrival and has played an important role in the club's growth and ambition. But no individual — however significant — determines decisions beyond their own club.” Ittihad is the only one of three Saudi teams in the top-tier AFC Champions League Elite not to have secured a place in the round of 16, with two group games remaining. Despite losing star striker Karim Benzema last week to Al-Hilal, which has a history of making high-profile signings, including Neymar from Paris Saint-Germain in 2023, Ittihad will advance to the next round if it defeats Al-Gharafa of Qatar on Tuesday. Al-Hilal leads the western zone and is the only team with a perfect record of six wins from six, meaning coach Simone Inzaghi can choose to rest players. Al-Ahli, which won its first Champions League title in May, is also guaranteed a spot in the knockout stage. In the eastern zone, only Vissel Kobe has clinched qualification, but Japan will have three teams in the round of 16 if both Sanfrecce Hiroshima and Machida Zelvia win this week. Chinese champion Shanghai Port is in last place and on the verge of being ousted from the tournament. Wins for Chengdu Rongcheng and Shanghai Shenhua would keep both teams in contention.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DAZN's agreement to exclusively distribute GRUP MEDIAPRO's dedicated 2026 FIFA World Cup channel on pay-TV in Spain will not remove the tournament entirely from free-to-air television, with key matches still protected by national regulations. While the deal gives DAZN access to all 104 matches of the expanded FIFA World Cup 2026 via a linear World Cup channel and on-demand coverage, Spanish legislation requires listed events to be broadcast free-to-air. This is expected to include Spain's matches, the final and selected later-stage games, most likely shown by RTVE on La 1 and RTVE Play. The Spanish model mirrors arrangements in other major European markets, where pay-TV and streaming operators hold comprehensive rights but public broadcasters retain access to protected fixtures. In the UK, the World Cup is listed under Ofcom's “Group A” events, meaning live coverage must be available free-to-air. In France, World Cup matches involving Les Bleus and the final are protected for free-to-air broadcast, typically via TF1, despite increasing competition from subscription-based sports services for full tournament coverage. DAZN's Spanish deal underlines a broader European trend as streamers and pay-TV platforms secure end-to-end tournament coverage and dedicated channels, while free-to-air broadcasters maintain a reduced but high-impact role focused on national interest matches and major finals.

Airbnb is projecting that around 17,000 visitors will book its rentals during the FIFA World Cup 2026, creating what it estimates to be $167 million in regional economic impact, write Alex Barreira and Emma Dooling for the Philadelphia Business Journal. These visits are expected to generate 126,000 room nights throughout Greater Philadelphia during the six World Cup matches planned for Lincoln Financial Field. According to the report, direct guest spending should reach about $52 million, while additional indirect and induced spending will likely push the total impact to roughly $167 million. Airbnb guests are expected to spend around $109 per night on their stays and put about $411 toward transport. Local Airbnb hosts are projected to earn close to $1,900 per visit, which will average about $160 per night. Additionally, the World Cup will have a long-term impact on local tourism, as, according to FIFA, 65 percent of World Cup visitors will often make a return visit to see the host cities after the competition has concluded.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Above, a countdown clock to the World Cup at Dilworth Park in Center City. More than 500,000 tourists are expected to visit Pennsylvania when the World Cup comes to Philly for a three-week stretch this summer. The bar and restaurant industry sees this as a golden opportunity for Philly's nightlife to capitalize on a swell of soccer fans and others coming to town to mark the United States' 250th anniversary. "We want to make sure that Philly is competitive with the other host cities," said Ben Fileccia, senior vice president of strategy and engagement at the Pennsylvania Restaurant and Lodging Association, a trade group based in Harrisburg. "We know people are going to be coming from all over the world, and their drinking schedule doesn't necessarily stop at 2 a.m. I would much prefer that liquor is being sold and provided by businesses that do this on a regular basis and know how to protect their guests." Lincoln Financial Field is hosting six World Cup matches, including one on the Fourth of July. The international soccer tournament is at the heart of a packed summer schedule that has made Philadelphia a global travel destination in 2026. The Philadelphia Convention & Visitors Bureau estimates more than 1 million international travelers will be in town this year. "We're going to be hosting a huge crowd, anyway," Fileccia said. It will also drive more tax revenue to the city and state." Other World Cup host cities, like New York and Miami, allow alcohol service until 4 a.m. or later. Kansas City is hosting six matches this summer, and lawmakers in Missouri recently passed legislation allowing bars and restaurants to stay open up to 23 hours straight during the World Cup. The bill would need to spell out how and when the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board should administer permits for businesses that want to adjust their hours. "Exploring extended business hours is one of many economic strategies that is being discussed as cities around the country prepare to host large-scale global events in 2026 and beyond," Karen Fegely, acting director of the Philadelphia Department of Commerce, said in a statement. PLCB accepted applications for a $5,000 "national event permit" allowing approved businesses to stay open until 4 a.m., but only if they hosted events sanctioned by the DNC. Thirty bars ended up with permits, including Center City sports bar Ladder 15 and Gayborhood hotspot Woody's. The PLCB is required to follow strict rules in any laws granting time-limited changes to the liquor code, spokesperson Shawn Kelly said. Many questions will need to be answered in Harrisburg, including how many bars could stay open late, whether the extended curfew would be restricted to certain neighborhoods and if there would be a cost to participate. "If and when the law is changed, PLCB will respond accordingly," he said. Zakary Pyzik, leader of the restaurant and lodging association's public affairs efforts in Harrisburg, said there has been "enthusiastic" support from a handful of state lawmakers based in Philly. Several of them, including Democrats and Republicans, declined to comment on plans to introduce legislation concerning bar hours this summer, or answer questions about the potential scope of extended service. There are a lot of questions operators would have to ask if they do get involved. Philadelphia Soccer 2026, FIFA's World Cup host committee for the city, did not respond when asked whether it has been involved in discussions about extended bar service or if it would partner with businesses for late-night events should a law get passed. Another group stage match between Ivory Coast and Ecuador on June 14 starts at 7 p.m. All of the other matches have 4 p.m. or 5 p.m. start times. Knockout round games could be three hours long if they end on penalty kicks. How much demand there will be for World Cup-related nightlife past 2 a.m. in Philly is difficult to predict. Watch parties at the festival are expected to draw as many as 25,000 people each day, and they may want to keep festivities going afterward, including at hotels contracted for the 39-day event. "I think there's a lot of different restaurants and bars in Philly that not only already operate with significant late-night demand, but would welcome the opportunity to explore extended hours," Pyzik said. The Pennsylvania Licensed Beverage & Tavern Association, another trade group in Harrisburg, is "supportive" of legislation to extend service hours but has some doubts about how successful it would be with businesses and customers. At least that's what bar owners tell me across the state. So I'm not sure how popular it would be with bar owners. Nonetheless, it would be worth giving bar owners that option." Moran said he expects lawmakers to address a range of regulatory issues for bars statewide this year due to the boost in tourism and major events. He noted the NFL Draft coming to Pittsburgh and the MLB All-Star Game in Philly as occasions that merit flexibility for venues that serve alcohol. "It's a much bigger issue that goes beyond the World Cup," he said. Pyzik said he's hopeful state lawmakers will get on board with a sensible plan to make Philadelphia an attractive nightlife destination for World Cup travelers, but he expects it will be a battle that's going to take bipartisan leadership. "Obviously, they've got divided government up (in Harrisburg) and it's an election year, so you've got partisan politics that will be on full display," he said. "We're mindful of the fact that even bridge naming resolutions in Harrisburg right now are uphill battles."</p>
