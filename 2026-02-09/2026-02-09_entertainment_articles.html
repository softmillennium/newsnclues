                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: In one of those “This is Hollywood, land of dreams” stories the aspirational epilogue in Pretty Woman is about, a spec script by a 20-something British actor with one produced episodic writing credit triggered a heated bidding war among top TV producers, networks and streamers, landing at A24 in a seven-figure deal with Nicole Kidman among A-listers in talks to star, Deadline has learned. (The project was originally titled Discretion; it will undergo a name change, in part not to be confused with the legal thriller drama series Discretion A24 has at Paramount+ with Nicole Kidman and Elle Fanning starring). 'Pillion', 'Hamnet' & Milestones for Bleecker Street & Vertical At The Specialty Box Office A24 Wins 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' Rights: TV Series In Works From JT Mollner, Glen Powell & Roy Lee; ImageNation Pic In Early Development The untitled drama centers on a struggling actor who takes a nannying job with a high-flying producer and her movie-star husband, plotting to seduce his employers and exploit their industry connections only to find himself ensnared in a far more dangerous game. At the time, Deadline profiled Brady, who didn't have U.S. representation, and Discretion, which had been optioned by Kudos. (The British production company will remain attached.) He is repped by UTA's co-head of TV Lit Dan Erlij, the architect behind the big auction last fall over another spec, Joshua Zetumer's supernatural drama Pagans, which was won by Netflix with a straight-to-series order after some 15-18 studios, platforms and producers bid for it. Brady's Discretion also sparked a bidding war when it was sent out last month, with nine offers on the table from the likes of Netflix, Amazon, Apple, FX, Peacock and others, sources said. There has been great curiosity about Brady, a virtual unknown as a writer, and some 27 meetings have been set up for him with producers, studios and networks. By Saturday morning, before Brady had a chance to start the process and while Netflix and Amazon were still making bids, A24 took the project off the market preemptively after a 24-hour blitz with a substantial seven-figure offer, sources said. Conversations started with Kidman and other top actors for lead roles. This has become a signature MO for A24. Last year, the company won a seven-way bidding war for Trigger Point, a spec script by Harrison Query. A24 developed the project internally and attached Joel Edgerton to star and Jeremy Saulner to direct before taking it out, sparking a bidding won by Netflix with a straight-to-series order. Similarly, A24 acquired the rights to Chandler's Baker's yet-to-be-published short story Discretion in a highly competitive situation with a 7-figure purchase price and additional million dollars in script/development fees. Both series are produced by A24-based Joe Hipps. Brady told Deadline in November that inspiration for the series came from a real-life friend who took on a job as home-help to a high-powered couple, before becoming entwined in their lives. The project takes references from Fatal Attraction, Eyes Wide Shut, and Sunset Boulevard while aiming to subvert storytelling conventions. “Erotic thrillers have historically always been very heterosexual, and it's the marital unit that is the hero that has to be preserved at all costs from an evil slut, who threatens that unity,” he said. “I thought about what this looks like in 2025. I wanted to break form and put a queer lens on it.” In addition to the title change, the drama is expected to undergo creative tweaks as it moves forward. As an actor, Brady has appeared on such series as The Diplomat, Andor, Tell Me Everything and Coronation Street. As a writer, his sole produced credit to date is an episode of the short-lived 2023 British YA series for Netflix Everything Now. He is working on his self-funded short Anon starring Con O'Neill, shot entirely on dash cam in his home city of Derby, and has another series project in development with Kudos for the BBC, an adaptation of Charlotte Vassell's novel The Other Half. Brady, who was mentored by All of Us Strangers director Andrew Haigh through the BFI Flare x BAFTA Cohort scheme, is also repped by Charlotte Knight of Knight Hall Agency in the UK. The erotic thriller genre has been enjoying a major comeback, with at least 10 TV and film projects in the works. The untitled Brady project is joining such series in development as Hancock Park at Netflix and Fifth Season starring Regé-Jean Page, Teach Me at Peacock starring Mandy Moore, and two more projects at Fifth Season, Night Float starring Nina Dobrev and Dangerous Liaisons.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After taking notice of the use of a piece of music from their 2017 film Phantom Thread in Amazon MGM Studios‘ Melania Trump documentary Melania, filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson and composer Jonny Greenwood are requesting its removal. “It has come to our attention that a piece of music from Phantom Thread has been used in the Melania documentary,” said the duo in a statement issued by Greenwood's camp. They noted that while “Jonny Greenwood does not own the copyright in the score, Universal failed to consult Jonny on this third-party use which is a breach of his composer agreement. As a result Jonny and Paul Thomas Anderson have asked for it to be removed from the documentary.” A cultural lightning rod released in theaters January 30 with a global rollout, Melania follows the current First Lady during the 20 days leading up to President Donald Trump's second inauguration in January 2025. While the doc has already grossed far more than many docs do, with over $13 million in its first two weekends, it's been the subject of controversy ever since it was announced by Amazon MGM in January 2025. Reportedly, the studio paid a staggering $40M for the doc, along with a forthcoming docuseries, and spent around $35M on marketing efforts, which would make Melania one of the most expensive docs ever, all things considered. Some have speculated the investment was politically motivated. Marking Radiohead guitarist Greenwood's fourth collaboration with Anderson following There Will Be Blood, The Master and Inherent Vice, Phantom Thread was a psychological drama centered on a haute couture '50s London dressmaker (Daniel Day-Lewis) and the young waitress (Vicky Krieps) he takes as his muse, leading to a twisted love affair. The film earned myriad Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Score, following its release through Focus Features. Greenwood and Anderson have more recently teamed on One Battle After Another, the darkly comedic thriller starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Teyana Taylor, Chase Infiniti, Benicio Del Toro and Regina Hall, which has picked up 13 Oscar nominations, with Greenwood in the running once again for Score. Anderson is looking likely to finally break through — in Best Picture, Director and/or Adapted Screenplay — with 14 nominations but no wins to date.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. Over 3 billion bucks in overall box office take? Giving A24 its highest-grossing film of all time? Happened just this weekend, when Josh Safdie's “Marty Supreme” crossed $147 million at the global box office. There's little doubt that the actor and three-time Best Actor nominee is a major box office draw, but Chalamet's resume is dotted with not just films in which he's very much the lead (“Marty Supreme,” “A Complete Unknown,” “Wonka,” the “Dune” franchise), but features that boast quite starry ensembles. Related Stories Is the ‘Wuthering Heights' Press Tour Messy Performance Art or Marketing Rage Bait? Utopia Launches New Membership on Patreon, Complete with Online Screenings, Special Events, and More Just how big is Chalamet's own star power as a leading man, we wondered? Not to worry, Chalamaniacs, it's still quite big: over 2 billion bucks in global returns. That means we didn't count films like “Little Women,” “Lady Bird,” “The French Dispatch,” “Don't Look Up,” “A Rainy Day in New York,” or “Hostiles,” in which the actor is one part of a big ensemble and couldn't reasonably be considered the lead (yes, we're sure there will be arguments that rebuff this thinking, and we're open to them). But that still means that in films that most people would call “a Timothée Chalamet” movie, the just-turned-30-year-old has helped pull in over 2 billion dollars at the box office. And this total will only go up (duh) and fast, as “Marty Supreme” has yet to open in a number of international markets, and Denis Villeneuve's much-anticipated “Dune: Part Three” is gearing up for a December release (a slot that has previously earned the prior two “Dune” films over a billion dollars alone at the box office). And while this 2-billion-dollar take doesn't yet place Chalamet in the tippy-top tier of his money-making acting brethren, consider this: of the current crop of top 10 earners, nine have made major money in traditional superhero roles (save for Tom Cruise, though we could all make the argument for Ethan Hunt as his own brand of superhero). Chalamet has yet to go that route, and still made plenty of money (and earned the kind of accolades that don't need to be sparked by Marvel or DC gigs) along the way.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Turning Point USA may have tried to lead a boycott and counter-program the Super Bowl halftime show, but somehow nearly every right-wing influencer managed to watch Bad Bunny bring down Levi's Stadium — and they are furious. But this year the hysterical MAGA masses are in rare form. Bad Bunny used the national stage to celebrate Latino culture, focusing on his Puerto Rican roots. He also invited a cast of celebrities to dance in his famed La Casita stage set. During his 13-minute show, Bad Bunny was not overtly political but he did send a message of unity as he paraded flags from all over Latin America. Bad Bunny's hater-in-chief remains President Donald Trump who, despite statements from the White House asserting that he would not be watching Bad Bunny and would instead support TPUSA, immediately posted an angry rant about the performance. “Nah, I like my half time shows in English from ppl who love America,” she wrote in response to a political science professor telling her she missed out on the halftime show for opting to watch the Turning Point USA's version. Daily Wire host Matt Walsh — who claimed he hadn't watched the performance and only seen social media clips — complained on X that “having the halftime show for your biggest game of the year in a language almost none of your lifelong fans can understand, while waving the flags of countries that none them are from, is the biggest fuck you that l've ever seen a corporation give to its own.” Walsh, like many others in his cohort, is apparently unaware that the NFL enjoys a global audience. The league regularly hosts sold out games in non-English predominant destinations including Mexico City, Rio, Madrid, Munich, and Paris. Not one second.” In 2020, Catturd declared that he was “never watching the NBA, NFL, MLB, or NASCAR again — and I won't miss it one damn bit.” We'll see you next year, sir.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. Stand-up comedian Chris Fleming recently joked that while other people are worried about the Olympics coming to Los Angeles in 2028, he's more concerned about the imminent release of Emerald Fennell's “Wuthering Heights” — in theaters from Warner Bros. on February 13. It's a timely joke (with a regrettably short shelf life for Fleming) that nevertheless feels like a strong thesis amid growing excitement and even brewing resentment for Fennell's bold film adaptation of Emily Brontë's historic novel. Related Stories Timothée Chalamet's Box Office Worth as a Leading Man? A Cool 2 Billion Dollars Utopia Launches New Membership on Patreon, Complete with Online Screenings, Special Events, and More Allegations of racism emerged months ago when Fennell chose Jacob Elordi (a white actor) as her Heathcliff (an explicitly dark-skinned character). Now, amid an increasingly messy global press tour, that debate and several others are being hashed out — on and off the red carpet. Between Fennell, Elordi, and star/producer Margot Robbie, the result is a stunning media frenzy caught somewhere between a U.K. royal engagement and the “It Ends with Us” PR crisis. After making her fiery feature debut with the rape-revenge thriller “Promising Young Woman,” Fennell sharpened her public reputation as a provocateur during the promotion of her sophomore feature, “Saltburn.” The writer/director had a notoriously nonchalant interview style that made some fans question Fennell's core understanding of the script she wrote, while others pointed out that paradox as proof her buzz-building had worked. Now, cross-multiplying that evasive, unapologetic persona with the ever-confrontational literary audience, Fennell is betting big on “Wuthering Heights” to sustain enough conversation to become a genuine, money-making hit. With an estimated $80 million budget, it's LuckyChap's biggest commercial gamble on Fennell to date — and whether this wild press tour is a real mistake or just clever marketing, the film's rollout is officially high risk, high reward. It's not every day a 179-year-old ghost story lights up Instagram and TikTok, but “Wuthering Heights” has long been a volatile, obsession-worthy tale that readers struggle to get over. But will the so-called “book girlies” turn on Fennell before then? Fennell has been cagey about what she is and isn't adapting, insisting she isn't making “Wuthering Heights” so much as “a version of it.” Even the stylized quotation marks that frame the title on the film's official posters have been parsed for deeper messaging, effectively forcing baseless fan theories and more serious-minded cultural critique into an online scrum that's as overwhelming as the baroque fashion we've already seen the trio wear on several red carpets. In 2023, following Fennell's Oscar win for Best Original Screenplay with “Promising Young Woman”, “Saltburn” arrived as a sneaky eat-the-rich saga dripping with irony. In her freshman feature, fronted by the straight-shooting Carey Mulligan) Fennell was more open to dissecting “Promising Young Woman” as a feminist allegory. But “Saltburn” saw the writer/director lean further into interpretive slipperiness and double down on her willingness to be disliked. That ambiguity didn't hurt Fennell's film but fueled its reputation. Teaming with LuckyChap again, Fennell seems to be taking that same approach with “Wuthering Heights” for a precarious, scaled-up version of a beloved story some people already feel they own. Brontë purists don't have to love Fennell's “Wuthering Heights” for the movie to make its money back, but the idea that literary audiences don't matter to an adaptation once it's released misunderstands how fandoms still impact theaters today. Talking about a movie, good or bad, is free marketing, and Fennell seems to understand better than most that enraging potential ticket-holders is a promotional strategy. When questions surfaced about Elordi's casting as Heathcliff and the novel's racial implications, Fennell's response, rooted in her childhood perception, felt clumsy. The critique is valid, especially at a time when white supremacy threatens so much of Western culture. But the fallout from that incident demonstrates how outrage compounds — often in unexpected ways. That same week, Robbie attended the world premiere of “Wuthering Heights” in Los Angeles, wearing a necklace associated with Elizabeth Taylor. It was gifted to the actress by Richard Burton (he played Heathcliff in 1958), but it's widely known as the Taj Mahal diamond because of its historic ties to India. Introducing the pair through a press tour that intoxicates but doesn't welcome fans in feels, if nothing else, honest. There's a punk-rock feminist streak to the film's promotional campaign so far. An attitude that suggests women directors don't need your approval — because they are the ones in charge. The luxury reads as alienating, but maybe it was always supposed to. For the Los Angeles world premiere, Robbie wore special rings (designed by CeCe Fein-Hughes) with Elordi, and the pair then did an interview about them in British Vogue. When “Wuthering Heights” debuted in London, Robbie wore a one-of-a-kind gown (designed by Dilara Findikoglu) modeled on Charlotte Brontë's Victorian mourning bracelet for her late sister. But the “Barbie” and Nate from “Euphoria” know better than most that celebrities can sell tickets. Audiences bring their own baggage to movie theaters, and Fennell's gambling that their fascination with her work will outpace any resentment they feel for how she treats the “Wuthering Heights” text. That bet extends to timing with Warner Bros. courting lonely hearts and contrarians alike with a Galentine's Day release that feels sort of off… but also not at all. When Robbie joked to Fandango that Fennell wanted viewers to “cry so hard they vomit” after seeing the film, she conveyed both caution and promise. Repeat viewings aren't guaranteed — but conversation almost certainly is. Professional reviews will set the tone as they always do. But the movie has already gone viral without them. Not only is social media overflowing with speculation, dissecting everything from elements of the trailer to the stability of Robbie's real-life marriage, but the press tour has also become its own sordid mystery framed by infinite perspectives. So, is it messy performance art or genius rage bait? Fennell's refusal to explain herself turns maybe-manufactured marketing into an extension of the source material theme. In an industry that rarely grants filmmakers enough artistic latitude, the spectacle of a woman's creativity spiraling out of control becomes a statement unto itself. From Warner Bros. Pictures, “Wuthering Heights” is in theaters Friday, February 13. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bad Bunny is no stranger to making history, and last night, he conquered another first when he became the first artist to perform only in Spanish at the Super Bowl halftime show. Additionally,  because of Bad Bunny's highly political Grammy acceptance speeches (he started one by declaring, “ICE out”), many people couldn't wait to see what Bad Bunny might say or do during his 13-minute halftime set. But in true Bad Bunny fashion, everything was a surprise. Here are some of the significant symbols and history lessons that were wrapped up in the show that you just might have missed. The halftime show began with a wide shot of people working in sugar-cane fields before the camera panned down to Bad Bunny singing “Tití Me Preguntó” as he walked past people cutting cane with machetes. Enslaved Africans worked the sugar plantations until 1873, when Puerto Rico under Spanish colonial rule ended slavery. After the U.S. took over in 1898, U.S. sugar companies gobbled up Puerto Rican lands while reaping enormous profits off Puerto Rican labor and land. As Bad Bunny walked through the sugar-cane fields during “Tití Me Preguntó,” he passed various scenes: friends at a coco frío stand, a group of older men playing dominoes, young women getting their nails done, and then a piragua (Puerto Rican shaved ice) stand where Benito is served the treat before he keeps walking. The piragua stand is an icon of Puerto Rican culture that signals community and nostalgia. Piragua stands can be found all over Puerto Rico and the diaspora. In piraguas, the shaved ice is usually topped with tropical flavored syrups that are displayed in glass bottles on the piragua cart. During Bad Bunny's halftime performance, each glass bottle of piragua syrup on the cart featured a different flag, including Colombia, Spain, Puerto Rico, and Mexico. On a screen above the halftime stage, viewers saw the animated character “Concho,” who is a key figure in Bad Bunny's DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS short film and album. Just days before DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS came out, Bad Bunny released a short film of the same name. That film featured Puerto Rican actor Jacobo Morales playing an elderly Bad Bunny who reminisces with his friend Concho as they looked through photos. At one point, Morales' character heads to the center of town to purchase quesitos (a Puerto Rican puff-pastry roll filled with sweet cream cheese). He wanders down the street and encounters an American cashier trying to sell him cheese-less vegan quesitos. No, the Little Boy in Bad Bunny's Super Bowl Set Was Not Liam Ramos A Timeline of Lady Gaga and Bad Bunny Fangirling Over Each Other Trump Got Bad Bunny's Message — And He Didn't Like It All the Celebrities Who Hung Out in La Casita During Bad Bunny's Halftime Show Bad Bunny performed several songs, including “Yo Perreo Sola,” “Safaera,” “Party,” and “Voy a Llevarte Pa' PR” from the rooftop of the famed “Casita” (Spanish for “little house”). This home was pink, in the Puerto Rican tradition of painting homes a bright color, with shuttered windows and a carved wood door. Bad Bunny turned the casita into one of his stages during his 2025 “No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí” residency in San Juan. On Super Bowl Sunday, the casita welcomed a host of important Latino celebrity guests such as Cardi B, Pedro Pascal, Young Miko, Karol G, and Jessica Alba. The portion of the halftime show that featured a wedding, plus Lady Gaga and Bad Bunny singing “Baile Inolvidable,” was a partial replica of Castillo San Felipe del Morro, more commonly known as El Morro. During Bad Bunny's performance of Nuevayol, he took a shot given to him by Maria Antonia “Toñita” Cay, or Toñita, a pillar of the Puerto Rican community in New York City and a link between the island and its diaspora. In the lyrics for “Nuevayol,” Bad Bunny shouts her out, saying, “Un shot de cañita en casa de Toñita/PR se siente cerquita” (A shot of rum in Toñita's house/Puerto Rico feels close). She has famously refused to sell her property, despite mass gentrification in the area. Given the issues Bad Bunny focuses on in DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS, it makes sense that he shouts out Toñita as an example of how the Puerto Rican community looks out for one another. The situation was so dire that many citizens taught themselves basic electrical skills and began risking their lives climbing electrical poles in order to begin reconnecting loose or damaged power lines and restoring power, sometimes to entire towns. This celebration of the Americas follows a long line of Latin musicians — including Panamanian Rubén Blades, Puerto Rican Residente, and Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, among many others — who have written songs uniting the Americas against U.S. imperial interests. This was a powerful rebuke to the exclusionary rhetoric coming from conservatives that Bad Bunny was not American enough to perform at the halftime show, and that Latinos in general are suspicious foreigners who aim to destroy “real American” ways of life. Instead, Bad Bunny proudly declared that America is much more than the United States, and that the United States would not be what it is without Latino and Caribbean immigrants. Kid Rock Delivers Half-Assed Lip-Synch at TPUSA Anti-Halftime Show All the Celebrities Who Hung Out in La Casita During Bad Bunny's Halftime Show Trump Got Bad Bunny's Message — And He Didn't Like It All of the Hidden Symbols and Meanings You May Have Missed in Bad Bunny's Super Bowl Set Martin is familiar to U.S. mainstream audiences from his crossover in the late-Nineties Latin boom. At the time, Martin, already an established Latin pop star, began singing in English, and embodied a Latin-lover stereotype with songs like “Livin' la Vida Loca” and “Shake Your Bon-Bon.” But at the Super Bowl, we saw a different Ricky: Not only did he sing in Spanish, but he also sang “Lo Que le Pasó a Hawaii,” arguably the most politicized song on DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS. The song itself is a call to arms that Puerto Ricans should hold onto their culture and their land in the face of rampant gentrification and displacement that stems from centuries of colonial rule. During Bad Bunny's residency in Puerto Rico, a different guest sang this song every week. There were various touches of light blue during the halftime show, a color associated with Puerto Rican independence. One notable pop of light blue was Lady Gaga's dress, which was adorned with the red flor de maga, the national flower of Puerto Rico. As the song “El Apagón” started, Bad Bunny emerged carrying a large Puerto Rican flag. In this context, the azul clarito has become associated with movements advocating for Puerto Rican independence. On his song “La Mudanza,” Bad Bunny raps, “Aquí mataron gente por sacar la bandera/Por eso es que ahora yo la llevo dondequiera” (They killed people here for having the flag/That's why now I take it with me everywhere). This references the Ley de la Mordaza, or Gag Law, which banned Puerto Ricans from having a Puerto Rican flag, let alone criticize colonialism, from 1948 to 1957. So, Bad Bunny clutching his flag with azul clarito on the halftime show set was a powerful anti-colonial statement. Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Except for all the new ones that have come to take their place. Are you feeling like your football-scouting operation has been taking a beating lately?Do you sometimes wonder why your spreadsheets can't get generated fast enough? Or perhaps your software coding is going slower than you always thought it would?Most of all, does your kid struggle with not being able to imagine the decor of his bedroom in your new home?If any of these problems resonate — and really, what could be more universal? — has Silicon Valley got an AI product for you.You may have noticed Sunday night that these four instances were prime AI use cases per a series of Super Bowl ads from the industry's biggest players (Microsoft Copilot, unicorn startup GenSpark, OpenAI‘s Codex and Google Gemini, respectively), either solving challenges that don't exist day-to-day for most Americans or, in the last case, solving a challenge that may actually be a good thing. Any parenting expert will tell you that temporary uncertainty or disappointment can healthily prepare a child for adulthood. Wouldn't it be nice if a computer happened along to make it easy and guaranteed?If you arrived unformed into the techno-capitalist parade that is the current iteration of the Super Bowl telecast, you would come to at least one very specific conclusion: technology will soon offload so much of our current toil. “It'll be whatever we want it to be,” the Gemini mother says to her son about their house — AI is apparently manna now — as onscreen a message flashes “A new kind of help from Google.” A more encapsulating set of credos I cannot imagine. Less clear.Tech revolutions at heart change the mechanisms by which humans live. This new revolution will lessen our need for a brain. Whether we want what this digital Che will wreak is another matter. Yes, on the surface, this ad spate is about AI products, which is about massive capitalizations, and Wall Street valuations, and many other -ations you hear on CNBC. But such talk of companies and products abstract, purposefully, what's really being sold.The abstracting reached its pinnacle (nadir) with an insidious Alexa ad featuring Chris Hemsworth and wife Elsa Pataky. He insisted the smart speaker could go sentient in various wildly extravagant ways and kill him — a classic straw man of painting anyone worried about AI Safety as some kind of tinfoil alarmist while cleverly ignoring the actual dangers, like Alexa's new policy of nonconsensual constant uploading. (See also under Amazon‘s Super Bowl Ring ad for how it saves all the lost dogs while, oh yes, turning on some kind of Big Brother camera for mass surveillance. I'm just here to help,” Alexa tells Hemsworth, which confoundingly seeks to have it both ways: “An AI can't have murderous feelings; that's silly. But it can have feelings of help and love!” (Literally an Alexa ad from earlier this football season starring Pete Davidson has him vulnerably telling a computer screen “I like you, too.”)To think about any of these tech company ads for more than five seconds is to realize how little they stand up to scrutiny. Which is exactly how the brands want it generally: feeling more, thinking less.Of course matters aren't that simple; we're just not that naive anymore. And indeed, in-between the shiny sales pitches came little glimpses of self-own. Anthropic went after OpenAI for how the latter's ad-based chatbot could be compromised without appearing to realize that asking sensitive information from a chatbot could be dangerous even when it wasn't trying to sell you something. Chris Pratt, Joel McHale, More React to Seattle Seahawks Super Bowl 2026 Win: "Go Hawks!" How Bad Bunny's Super Bowl Halftime Show Put Boricua Culture on the World's Stage “Artlist's Big Game debut proves that high-end video production is no longer gated by time, budget, or access,” an accompanying press release touted. No doubt such efficiency boasts land with Madison Avenue beancounters, but the rest of us may find ourselves busier trying to recover from the retinal burning brought on by these proto-assaults of slop. One standout came from Volkswagen — which went back to its “90's “Drivers Wanted” slogan and the deeply human vibes of its seminal Nick Drake spot from that era (directed by a pre Little Miss Sunshine Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris!) Soundtracked by House of Pain's 90's staple “Jump Around,” the spot showed a young professional guy leaving his laptop life behind to play with his dog; a Gen Z woman dancing in the rain and getting her friends to exit the car to join her; a driver making a U-turn to follow an ice cream truck; and a group in a schoolyard cheering on a besuited corporate worker to kick back their soccer ball over the fence, Messi penalty-kick style, which he eventually does, incurring sweet release.Hardly a smartphone appears in the spot, let alone any AI,  and the whole vibe blissfully shrugs its shoulders at the “let a computer tell you what to do” low-key enslavement of so many of the other spots that aired Sunday night (and at the slop; it was shot on film).“Being so programmed puts us in handcuffs, and we wanted to push back on that,” Rachel Zaluzec, Volkswagen's chief marketing officer, told me in an interview Friday. The company didn't even set out to make a Super Bowl ad, she said; it simply wanted to react to all the automation out there before soon realizing that it had a newly relevant “Drivers Wanted” campaign capturing the essence of those refreshing pre-tech days.“We see this as a recruiting campaign for an invitation to participate,” she said. “All this tech has its place of course but we should be asking, ‘are we controlling it or is it controlling us? '” Even driving, she added, could be a human act compared to the shut-offery of our Uberized and Waymoified world. “There's nothing like putting your hands on the wheel and deciding where you want to go,” she said.One of the slop-makers was trying to temper their message, too. It has become fashionable to rag on AI, and for some brands and public pronouncers this is, as you might warily suspect, a pose — a cheap monetization of hipster skepticism more than a carefully thought-out ideology. But a kernel of meaning sits at the heart of even the most blithe pushbacks — that we should ask what all this technology that has come to automate and convenientize our lives will take away with it.AI is coming and technology can't be stopped; about that Bob Iger, who recently made the point to David Muir, is right. Sure, as a broad concept the idea of AI is moving forward; there are too many stakeholders for it not to. And too many unassailably positive use cases for it not to. Most important of all — and this was decidedly hidden by the brands on NBC Sunday night — we can do something about the onslaught. If we reject slop, AI video-generation tools get marginalized; if we evince skepticism about using a chatbot for mental health, Claude and ChatGPT see their reach curbed.It's telling that even as Google was making the case for how Gemini can think a house into existence and dispel the worry of its new inhabitants it used a very real Randy Newman singing “Feels Like Home” to make the point, and not, say, an AI trained on “the greatest living songwriters.” A more ironic undercutting of a tech company's message you will not find: “Machines can address all of our emotional needs, and to convince you of that we'll draw on the most human of artists.” But Big Tech leaders don't really do irony, and they're not worried about undercutting. Just keep pushing products that will make life more efficient, they believe, and hope that, faced with a world made so exhausting and overwhelming (by tech), consumers will grasp at any product that brings them momentary relief — the executives unaware, it seems, that we can simply be recruited not to participate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While Bad Bunny was expressing love during his 2026 Super Bowl halftime show, Donald Trump decided to react with hate. It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn't represent our standards of Success, Creativity, or Excellence,” Trump wrote. They Just Got Married During His Super Bowl Halftime Show I Watched Turning Point USA's Kid Rock Halftime Show So You Don't Have To There is nothing inspirational about this mess of a Halftime Show and watch, it will get great reviews from the Fake News Media, because they haven't got a clue of what is going on in the REAL WORLD — And, by the way, the NFL should immediately replace its ridiculous new Kickoff Rule. Videos circulated on social media showing Bad Bunny's halftime show playing inside Trump's Super Bowl party at his Mar-a-Lago golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida — instead of Turning Point USA's MAGA-friendly “All American” Halftime Show” alternative with Kid Rock. The Puerto Rican rapper and singer not only brought a bit of his culture to the global stage to share with everyone, with a set inspired by his hometown community in Puerto Rico, but he also told a love story throughout his show on football's biggest night. Ever since Bad Bunny was announced as this year's Super Bowl headliner, Trump has been critical of the decision, as the “DtMF” singer has been very outspoken against his administration's aggressive immigration enforcement. Most recently, Bad Bunny slammed ICE at the 2026 Grammys during his acceptance speech. He also opted out of holding U.S. stops on his Debí Tirar Más Fotos World Tour due to worries of potential ICE raids at his concerts. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Backup dancers, some dressed as grass and others in head-to-toe Puerto Rican jíbaro regalia—traditional all-white clothes topped with a straw pava hat—crowded the stage. The iconic pink casita that has played a central role in Bad Bunny's Debí Tirar Más Fotos live show was being put together. The man himself was rubbing his hands together, hyping himself up as all around him a miniature Borikén was being built in the middle of Levi's Stadium in San Francisco, transporting him back home before bringing the flavor of his island to the world yet again. The man of the hour appeared in an all-white jersey emblazoned with “Ocasio 64” and opened with Un Verano Sin Ti standout “Tití Me Preguntó.” He ran through the grass toward the casita's rooftop, running into boxers, baddies at a makeshift nail salon, a piragua stand, and a jeweler who gave him a ring, which he promptly gave away to a dancer: “Muchacho deja eso” (Man, leave that). The perreo medley raged on, mashing together hits from across Bad Bunny's discography, including “Yo Perreo Sola,” “Safaera,” “Party,” “VOY A LLeVARTE PA PR,” and a nod to OG marquesina parties that featured bits of songs by Daddy Yankee and Tego Calderón before seguing into “EoO.” After violin-tinged “MONACO,” he looked into the camera and almost whispered to the viewer: “Nunca dejé de creer en mí, y tu también deberías creer en ti.” He never stopped believing in himself, so maybe you should believe in yourself. Bad Bunny's massive global fanbase is drawn to this authenticity. With 19.8 billion streams in 2025 and a historic Grammy win for the first Spanish-language Album of the Year, keeping it real has meant downing Smashburgers and having his therapist on speed dial. It wasn't Bad Bunny's first time on the field (real ones remember Benito in an all-silver getup playing second fiddle to Shakira during her co-headlined Super Bowl performance with Jennifer Lopez six years ago), but Bad Bunny's headlining slot for Super Bowl LX was the first time in the NFL Championship's 60-year history where the main performance was done entirely in Spanish. Talking to Zane Lowe on the Thursday before, wearing big sunglasses, a gray fur coat, and a bunny-eared beanie, Benito seemed visibly tired. He said he wanted to think of this latest career milestone, performing on the most-watched TV event of the year, as “13 minutes doing something that [he loves].” It's a sweet way to process the moment, and it showed in how he went about the affair—with fun, love, pleasure, and unabashed joy. Watching him crowdsurf to “NUEVAYoL” and run around in his Sunday best, paying homage to Boricuas on the island and the rich Nuyorican culture thriving in New York City, was extremely satisfying. Latinxs who have found refuge in Williamsburg social club Toñitas will have been moved to see the legendary Nuyorican stronghold's namesake matriarch where she is usually found: behind a bar, with a kind word to give, squeezing liquid courage into Benito's hand. In true Bad Bunny fashion, there was also a lot of tenderness and righteousness to balance out the shots of rum. In a heartwarming and time-bending set piece, Benito bequeathed his Grammy award to a small child who was just watching his acceptance speech on an old TV. Ricky Martin, one of the first Puerto Rican entertainers to go mainstream in a big way, sang the anti-colonial warning song “LO QUE LE PASÓ A HAWAii,” voice trembling.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Being a fan of Bad Bunny who doesn't speak more than the most rudimentary Spanish means you miss a lot of the nuance of what he's saying. He knows this; in an appearance on the New York Times Popcast earlier this week, he said that even a lot of his fellow Latinos miss out on what he's saying because he often raps in Puerto Rican slang. In closing his Super Bowl LX halftime performance, Bad Bunny issued a statement impossible to misunderstand. In the final moment of his set on February 8, Bad Bunny, holding a football that read “Together, we are America,” said “God bless America” before listing the countries of South America, North America, and some of the Caribbean. He was flanked by flags of all of these countries as the Jumbotron behind him displayed the message, in English, “THE ONLY THING MORE POWERFUL THAN HATE IS LOVE.” By virtue of his birth in Puerto Rico, Bad Bunny is American, just like someone born in Canada, or Mexico, or Cuba, or Bolivia, or Chile is American. This is not a new thought, but it is one that deserves to be repeated, especially as the MAGA wing of U.S. politics pushes for an increasingly narrow definition of who gets to claim to be an American. These are people who were upset that Bad Bunny was selected to be the halftime performer, and upset again by his plain refusal to sing in English for the event. Turning Point USA was angry enough to plan a rival halftime set that it streamed on YouTube. (It was also supposed to stream on right-wing slop trough X, but the organizers flubbed that one.) Absurdly dubbed “The All-American Halftime Show,” TP's starred Kid Rock, Brantley Gilbert, Lee Brice, and Gabby Barrett. Talk about a narrow definition of American. Of course, the crowd who would willingly tune into something like that is not the crowd that Bad Bunny is trying to woo. For as long as Bad Bunny has been famous in the United States, he has stubbornly refused to water down his identity as a Puerto Rican or to stop singing in Spanish. But as we saw at halftime, he isn't against bringing in English when there's something he wants to be sure is understood by people too incurious to use Google Translate. I know America is the whole continent.” There were other parts of the performance, too, where he spelled out what he meant for the non-Spanish speakers. We then got the image of Bad Bunny handing his recently won Album Of The Year Grammy to a little boy in Puerto Rico watching on TV. America is bigger than you might think, the performance says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chris Brown is not a fan of Big Bunny's Super Bowl LX halftime performance. “I think it's safe to say… they need me,” Brown wrote on his Instagram Stories, followed by a winking face emoji. The post came minutes after Bad Bunny gave an electric performance during the prestigious halftime show, which celebrated his native Puerto Rico. The rapper, who performed entirely in Spanish, thrilled the crowd with songs like “Monaco,” “Yo Perreo Sola,” and “Tití Me Preguntó,” while celebrities including Cardi B, Pedro Pascal, Alix Earle, Jessica Alba and Karol G danced around him. Fellow Puerto Rican Ricky Martin also surprised the crowd, as he sang “Lo Que Pasó a Hawaii.” By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Brown has never performed at a Super Bowl halftime show. He was sentenced to five years' probation and six months of community service. In 2017, Brown's ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran was granted a five-year restraining order against him. Brown allegedly became aggressive toward the “Claws” alum for not returning money and gifts he had given her during their relationship. Last year, the “No Guidance” singer was arrested in Manchester, England, for allegedly hitting music producer Abe Diaw with a tequila bottle at a London nightclub in 2023. In October 2023, Diaw filed a lawsuit against Brown, claiming the singer had assaulted him eight months prior.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the wake of Bad Bunny's momentous halftime show at Super Bowl LX on February 8, musicians, politicians, and many others are giving the Puerto Rican artist his flowers. On X, New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani wrote, “NUEVAYoL” alongside the Puerto Rican flag emoji, while Mavi remarked: “this shit hard im finna stop speaking English actually fuck English.” The Marías expressed some Puerto Rican pride, writing: “boricuaaaa.” Rauw Alejandro posted about the many Latin genres and dance styles Bad Bunny included in the show. Kacey Musgraves pointedly called out the conservative non-profit Turning Point USA's “All-American Halftime Show,” which streamed on YouTube at the same time as Bad Bunny's performance and featured Kid Rock. That made me feel more proudly American than anything Kid Rock has ever done,” Musgraves wrote. Doechii, who made her own appearance at the Super Bowl in an ad for Levi's jeans, posted on X: “Bad Bunny WOW ! History.” On Threads, Kerry Washington echoed the sentiment, sharing: “I don't know if I'll ever recover from that… WHAT👏🏾A👏🏾SHOW👏🏾.” SG Lewis said: “Holy shit that was the best half time show I've ever seen” and Monte Booker concurred, posting: “one of the best half times.” Nick León also supported the artist, writing: “Love bad bunny forever.” Nancy Sinatra felt similarly, quoting a post from Lynda Carter about Bad Bunny with: “Love him.” John Mellencamp added, “I don't know what Bad Bunny is saying, however, I do know he is standing up for Puerto Rico and I am standing up for him. Bad Bunny's halftime show was a love letter to Puerto Rico and Latinx communities around the world with ambitious set design and many, many special guests. Artists who joined him included Lady Gaga (with whom he salsa danced), Ricky Martin, Karol G, Young Miko, and Cardi B.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The superstar's 13-minute performance celebrated Puerto Rican culture on a global stage. After a momentous Grammys night on Feb. 1 — where he became the first artist to win album of the year with an all-Spanish-language LP, Debí Tirar Más Fotos — Bad Bunny ignited the Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. on Sunday (Feb. 8) with a headlining Super Bowl Halftime Show destined to go down in history. As the Seattle Seahawks soared to a 9-0 lead over the New England Patriots by halftime, anticipation was high for El Conejo Malo to take over. He kicked off his electrifying set with “Tití Me Preguntó” while donning an off-white football jersey emblazoned with his last name, Ocasio, and the number '64. As he belted out the anthem, Bad Bunny made his way through scenes bursting with cultural pride — field workers, people playing dominoes, women getting their nails done, snow-cone makers preparing piraguas, and even boxers training under a spotlight. Meanwhile, cameos from stars like Karol G, Jessica Alba, and Cardi B added extra star power to the spectacle. Then he segued into “Yo Perreo Sola” and “Voy a Llevarte Pa' PR” as he climbed onto the roof of a pickup truck — with “perreo” emblazoned on the plates — surrounded by dozens of girls dancing in sync. With brief samples of Tego Calderón's “Pa Que Te Lo Gozen,” Don Omar's “Dale Don Dale” and Daddy Yankee's “Gasolina,” the hard-hitting, Grammy-winning hit “EoO” pulsed through the stadium. “This is the music of Puerto Rico,” he shouted in Spanish, and a full-blown reggaetón party erupted. The iconic toad, Coquí — a signature of his tour — made an appearance, delighting fans. Suddenly, violinists emerged, adding a dramatic flair to the moment introducing “Monaco.” “Buenas tardes, California, mi nombre es Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio,” he declared, voice brimming with emotion, “y si ahora estoy en el Super Bowl LX, es porque nunca, nunca dejé de creer en mí.” Then, looking straight into the camera, he delivered a heartfelt message: “Tú también nunca dejes de creer en ti.“ Adding to the magic, the beloved Toñita — owner of Brooklyn's Caribbean Social Club, famously shouted out in “NuevaYol” — appeared on stage to hand Bad Bunny a drink. Holding up a football emblazoned with the words “Together We Are America,” he delivered a poignant response to criticism he has faced, reinforcing his message of unity and empowerment. Despite the artist's attempts to steer clear of politics, this year's halftime performance has sparked significant discourse, becoming one of the most talked-about and debated shows in recent memory. When asked about his intentions for the show, Bad Bunny humbly reflected on the power of his music in a Friday (Feb. 6) interview with Access Hollywood's Scott Evans: “I'm just a normal guy that makes music. I want to make them feel proud and think that everything is possible.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Love was in the air during Bad Bunny's epic Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show. “They invited Bad Bunny to their wedding and in turn he invited them to get married during his performance.” Fans on X gushed over how “freaking cool” and “awesome” that detail was. The bride and groom were seen throughout the show, at one point dancing and at another point there was an officiant. “Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine one of my wedding dresses making a cameo at the Super Bowl. Seeing [the dress] during Bad Bunny's halftime show is, well, loco. But what makes it truly special is that it's worn by a real bride on her wedding day,” the designer told Page Six in a statement. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Other stars seen dancing to his hit tunes on the field included Cardi B, Jessica Alba, Alix Earle, Karol G and Pedro Pascal. Bad Bunny also incorporated his historic Grammys win from last week's awards show into the performance, as his album “Un Verano Sin Ti” is the first Spanish-speaking album to be nominated for best album of the year. Bad Bunny, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, exclaimed, “God bless America,” and held up a football that read, “Together, we are America” in a powerful conclusion. On Thursday, the rapper teased there would be a “huge party” during his 2026 Super Bowl performance while speaking at the Apple Music Halftime Show press conference — though no one could have guessed he would be celebrating a couple's union. “They don't even have to learn Spanish; it's better if they dance, but there's no better dance that comes from the heart. … Of course, choose your team at the game.”</p>

Moments before the Pima County Sheriff's Department shared its latest update, reports began circulating on Twitter as two marked vehicles appeared to be parked in Guthrie's driveway. Guthrie's Tucson, Arizona, home has been swarmed with reporters and independent journalists alike for more than a week. After detectives' initial search for evidence, a video began circulating online showing what appeared to be blood drops on the front porch of Guthrie's home. Sheriff Chris Nanos later revealed during a Thursday, February 5, press conference that DNA results determined the blood belonged to the 84-year-old victim. And we understand,” Savannah said in a video plea shared to Instagram on Saturday, February 7. This is the only way we will have peace. This is very valuable to us and we will pay.” Guthrie's plea was addressed to their mother's alleged kidnappers after ransom notes were received by multiple news outlets. According to TMZ's Harvey Levin, who was the first to report receiving such a letter, the abductors included two deadlines in their demands. The first, which was Thursday, February 5, at 5 p.m., has passed. I think everybody kind of knows the way this plays out when people write ransom notes.” The second deadline has been reported as Monday, February 9, at 5 p.m. local time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You might be used to seeing Drew Barrymore and Valerie Bertinelli as brunettes. However, when the two got together on Barrymore's show, they both tried a new look that involved gray hair. “The Drew Barrymore Show” took to Instagram to share a video of Bertinelli's appearance, and added a caption that noted, “Celebrity hairstylist [Chris Appleton] pulls off the most unexpected hair transformation for Drew and [Valerie Bertinelli]! Both ladies look amazing and absolutely slay the silvery shades. Following her appearance on Barrymore's show, Bertinelli hopped onto Instagram to share a photo of herself in the gray wig. She also had a few questions for her followers, which she included in the caption of her post, writing, “Should I do it? Does it have more to do with identity?” Is one more important than the other? Noting that she “think[s] it's a little about self-­perception and the friction between how we feel and how we appear,” she went on to say that “[i]t's about the version of ourselves we feel comfortable showing. It's about how much of ourselves we choose to see in the mirror. Wondering if she's perhaps not alone in her thinking and questions, she continued, “I see so many beautiful women who gloriously grow out their grey and if I can be completely honest, I'm a little envious. If Bertinelli does decide to let her gray hair grow, then she'll have a lot of support. Actress Jennifer Love Hewitt also left a comment, saying, “You look hot.” “One of the best things you'll ever do for yourself. It's a process that will help you grow so much.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bad Bunny‘s highly anticipated Super Bowl halftime show is in the books, with the Puerto Rican superstar bringing light, love, music and dance to the country at a time when it's needed more than ever — and he didn't do it alone. As previously speculated, Benito brought out some guests during his Sunday (Feb. 8) performance at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, sharing the field with Lady Gaga — who treated fans to a surprise salsa rendition of her Billboard Hot 100-topping hit “Die With a Smile,” sans duet partner Bruno Mars — and Ricky Martin, who had his own solo moment singing “Lo Que Le Pasó a Hawaii.” But what no one could have predicted was the crop of A-listers who joined Bad Bunny for the show simply to vibe and hang out in the back, from Cardi B to Pedro Pascal, Karol G, Jessica Alba and Young Miko, each of whom stood out amid a joyous crowd of partiers on the singer/rapper's elaborate Puerto Rico-inspired set and danced along to the music. Despite many conservatives taking issue with the choice of a predominantly Spanish-speaking performer for the 2026 halftime program — something that culminated in Turning Point USA hosting an alternate mid-game show — the hitmaker made it clear that his only agenda is to cultivate community, a message his guest stars endorsed just by being there.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than 20 years after fellow video game adaptation auteur Uwe Boll last adapted House Of The Dead, Paul W.S. Anderson is taking a crack at the property. Initially announced in 2024, Anderson's version of Sega's classic first-person zombie shoot-'em-up is still showing signs of life, casting Isabela Merced, who is well-versed in adaptations of popular zombie games. Unlike Boll, who directed an adaptation of Sega's hit video game in 2003, Anderson, as his wont, finds himself drawn to the games' elaborate mythology, which could serve as the basis for an entire run of films, not unlike his billion-dollar-grossing Resident Evil movies. To wit, Anderson envisions “this as the start of a tentpole franchise which can explore the rich world and lore that Sega has created over a whole series of films” with “Isabela at its heart.” According to Deadline, the series is a “top Sega priority,” along with facilitating Sonic the Hedgehog's crippling chilidog addiction. It is nice to see the old boys of schlocky 2000s video game adaptations crossing paths yet again. It shouldn't be too much of a lift for Anderson to overcome Boll's legacy, especially considering how efficient a blockbuster director Anderson has become over the intervening years. But what we'd really like to see, even more than another version of House Of The Dead, is Uwe Boll getting back to what matters: Challenging people to boxing matches. Boll vs. Anderson would raise a lot of money for charity.
