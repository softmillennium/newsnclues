                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Food and Drug Administration said Novo Nordisk's TV advertisement for its newly launched Wegovy pill for obesity included "false or misleading" claims about the medicine's abilities and benefits to patients. In a letter to Novo dated Feb. 5, the FDA said the ad misbrands the oral drug, making its distribution a violation of federal law. In a statement Monday, Novo Nordisk confirmed that it received the letter and clarified that the ad has been running since the pill's launch, but is not the company's Super Bowl spot. "We take all regulatory feedback seriously and are in the process of responding to the FDA to address their concerns regarding the advertisement's presentation," Liz Skrbkova, Novo's head of U.S. media and stakeholder relations, said in the statement. It adds to the mounting hurdles the Danish drugmaker is facing as it scrambles to win back market share from chief rival Eli Lilly and cheaper compounded copycats in the booming GLP-1 market. The company's Wegovy pill is key to those efforts. It was the first-ever GLP-1 pill for obesity to enter the market in January, and Novo last week said more than 170,000 American patients are already taking the drug. In the letter, the FDA said Novo's ad misleadingly suggests its pill offers superior benefits to other approved GLP-1 weight loss drugs. The agency said phrases used in the spot, including "live lighter" and "a way forward," imply greater weight loss than other treatments and added benefits beyond that, despite no evidence to support those claims. The ad's statements "misleadingly imply benefits beyond physical weight loss such as emotional relief, reduced psychological burden, hope, or direction for patients' lives, positioning the drug as a solution to broader life challenges rather than a treatment for a specific condition, when this has also not been demonstrated," the FDA said in the letter. The FDA also flagged the ad for failing to properly present risk information in both audio and text, a requirement for television drug advertising. Also on Monday, Novo Nordisk sued Hims & Hers, asking the court to stop the telehealth company from mass marketing compounded versions of its Wegovy pill and injections. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This year's Super Bowl brought out more than just fans in jerseys. Tom Brady, Jay-Z, and Travis Kelce were just a few of the people who brought their fashion A-game. Here's a look at the luxury pieces that made for standout looks, from designer outerwear to expensive watches. He looked sharp at the big game in a black double-breasted Fear of God blazer, which retails for $2,200. He accessorized with a pair of Chrome Hearts Cliterally sunglasses. Jay-Z and Blue Ivy Carter were two of them, making their annual appearance at the game together. Meanwhile, his daughter rocked a black Off-White varsity bomber jacket. She paired it with a Balenciaga Neo Cagole City bag in denim, which retails for $3,500. Tom Brady did just that when he showed up to the Super Bowl in a custom NFL MVP varsity jacket with his name on it. Travis Scott arrived at the Super Bowl in vintage Chanel. He wore a cream linen baseball jersey with the interlocking CC logo and accessorized with several gold chains, including one featuring a crucified Jesus pendant on an anchor. He also wore what appeared to be diamond stud earrings, a Casio calculator watch on his wrist, and yes, his orange iPhone 17 Pro made its way into the look, too. Travis Scott wasn't the only celebrity to wear sparkling accessories. During Bad Bunny's halftime show, Lady Gaga made a guest appearance while wearing her massive diamond engagement ring and a cascading pair of Chopard earrings.</p>

The Big Four firm has limited hiring for new associates in the advisory division to 13 offices, Yolanda Seals-Coffield, chief people and inclusion officer for PwC US, told Business Insider in an interview. Previously, entry-level consulting hires could join any of PwC's 72 US office locations. But since fall 2025, advisory associates have been assigned to one of 13 offices, which include key markets like New York, San Francisco, and Washington, DC. Tax and assurance recruits can still apply to all of PWC's US offices, a firm spokesperson told Business Insider. "The idea is that we want to bring people together in a connected way for those first couple of years," she said. By consolidating junior consultants into fewer offices, PwC hopes to build a greater sense of community and encourage new recruits to grow together in their first two years, said Seals-Coffield. After that, they may move to different offices. "You may start in Atlanta and then say, great, I've got my two years of experience. Limiting the number of offices they can join will not impact overall hiring numbers, a PwC spokesperson told Business Insider. The decision to bring consultants together in their first years in the firm is part of PwC's broader push towards collaborative learning. "Getting our people to spend more time together, learning and growing in an intentional way, is the goal of the experience," she added. Straight advisory projects are being replaced with building, implementing, and maintaining tools for companies, requiring technology expertise over research skills. As consultants begin working with AI agents, they also need to sharpen their "human" skills, such as empathy and critical thinking.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The privately held data analytics software company also said that its annualized revenue exceeded $5.4 billion for the January quarter, up 65% year over year, while delivering free cash flow over the past year. That type of performance might whet the appetites of public market investors, who have not seen many new issuances of technology companies with high growth rates. Databricks is prepared to go public "when the time is right," co-founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi told CNBC in an interview. This year is shaping up to potentially feature notable tech IPOs. Fast-growing artificial intelligence labs Anthropic and OpenAI are also considering 2026 initial public offerings, according to people familiar with the matter. Elon Musk said in December that his rocket company SpaceX could also go public this year. Like many other companies, Databricks is generating revenue from AI. The company helps its clients connect their data with AI models to launch custom agents, in addition to providing tools for storing, processing and querying data. The company said in December that it was raising more than $4 billion in the round at a valuation of $134 billion. "We weren't sure we're going to actually be able to raise all of the five," said Ghodsi, adding that there was heavy interest in recent weeks. He said it can take months for venture capital to reflect major changes in equity markets. JPMorgan led the debt round, and now Databricks has billions in cash on hand. "If this correction hasn't bottomed out yet, and it's just going to continue, we're just going to continue as a private company," Ghodsi said. Databricks is now larger than rival Snowflake, which reported $1.21 billion in revenue in the October quarter. Snowflake's market cap stands at about $58 billion. With the wide release of its Lakebase database last week, Databricks has expanded its market, challenging incumbents such as Oracle and SAP. Oracle and Snowflake shares both fell about 13% last week as software stocks took a step down across the market. That happened due to investors worrying that open-source plugins for Anthropic's Claude Cowork AI-powered productivity tool might pose new competitive challenges for public software companies. "The correction is an overreaction, and you're going to see all these companies be around, and nobody's getting rid of them anytime soon," Ghodsi said. — CNBC's Ashley Capoot contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Funds have continued to pour in to support workers affected by layoffs at The Washington Post, raising more than $700,000 across two GoFundMe campaigns. The layoffs were announced last Wednesday, and within one day, a GoFundMe page had raised $350,000 for laid-off staff. Five days on, and around 4,700 supporters have donated over $520,000 to this page. The GoFundMe, which launched just a few hours after company executives began cutting workers, was organized by Post reporter Rachel Siegel and other members of the newsroom's union. A separate GoFundMe page for the Post's international employees has also raised almost $200,000 with about 2,100 donations.

A spokesperson for The Washington Post told Business Insider that it "is actively supporting employees impacted by last week's restructuring, including transition support for our international employees." Post owner and Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, has drawn significant criticism over his stewardship of the company in the last few days. "Each and every day our readers give us a roadmap to success. The data tells us what is valuable and where to focus." Business Insider's Dan Whateley and Sydney Bradley previously reported that the amount of money in the fundraisers and the speed at which they hit six figures make them outliers among media layoff fundraisers. "Post Guild members have come together to support their colleagues with this GoFundMe," said a spokesperson for the Washington Baltimore News Guild last week.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As OpenAI faces intensifying pressure from rival Anthropic's improved coding tools, CEO Sam Altman is telling employees and investors that his company is seeing its share of momentum. Altman told OpenAI employees on Friday that ChatGPT, the company's popular artificial intelligence chatbot, is "back to exceeding 10% monthly growth," according to an internal Slack message viewed by CNBC. OpenAI is also preparing to launch "an updated Chat model" this week, Altman said. More than 800 million people use ChatGPT each week, but Google and Anthropic have been gaining ground. OpenAI declared a "code red" in December to improve ChatGPT, and temporarily sidelined several projects to focus on that effort. In his message on Friday, Altman said OpenAI's coding product, Codex, grew about 50% from a week ago. Codex competes directly with Anthropic's Claude Code, which has seen a wave of adoption over the last year. OpenAI launched a new Codex model, GPT‑5.3-Codex, last week, as well as a stand-alone app for users with Apple computers. Altman said Codex's growth is "insane," according to the internal message. "This was a great week," Altman wrote. In a post on X, Altman said that the commercials were "deceptive" and that OpenAI would "obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them." OpenAI expects ads to make up less than half of its revenue long term, the person said. The digital ad market has long been dominated by Google and Meta, with Amazon becoming a bigger player in recent years. Altman and CFO Sarah Friar have been selling investors on OpenAI's growth story as the company looks to wrap up what could be a $100 billion fundraising round, sources told CNBC. In private meetings, the executives are highlighting OpenAI's strength with consumers, growing enterprise business and access to compute, according one person, who asked not to be named because the talks are private. OpenAI has been circulating charts as part of the discussions. One chart shows that Codex, based on internal data, is eating into Claude Code's market share, according to a screenshot seen by CNBC. OpenAI expects fundraising talks to heat up over the next two weeks, one person said. The current funding round could close in two parts, as CNBC previously reported. The first would include capital from Microsoft and Nvidia as well as Amazon, which is in talks to invest up to $50 billion in the company. Other contributions from participants like SoftBank, which has discussed putting in another $30 billion, would follow. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novo Nordisk on Monday said it is suing online telehealth provider Hims & Hers for mass marketing cheaper, unapproved copies of the drugmaker's new Wegovy obesity pill and injections in the U.S. Novo is asking the court to permanently ban Hims from selling compounded versions of its drugs that infringe on the company's patents and is seeking to recover damages. "This is a complete sham, and it has been a sham since the shortage ended," said John Kuckelman, Novo's group general counsel of global legal, intellectual property and security, in an interview. "The fact is that their medicines are untested, and they're putting patients at risk," he added, referring to how the safety, efficacy and quality of compounded medicines are not verified by U.S. regulators. The move escalates the feud between Novo and Hims, which said on Saturday it will stop offering its new copycat obesity pill after facing scrutiny from federal regulators and legal threats from the Danish drugmaker. Hims had planned to offer the oral drug for as little as $49 for the first month, roughly $100 less than Novo's approved Wegovy pill. In a statement on Monday, Hims said the lawsuit is "a blatant attack by a Danish company on millions of Americans who rely on compounded medications for access to personalized care" and is another case of Big Pharma "weaponizing the US judicial system to limit consumer choice. The lawsuit comes as Novo works to reclaim market share in the booming obesity drug market and fend off competition from both Eli Lilly and a wave of compounded alternatives. Those copycats have proliferated under a regulatory loophole that allows companies like Hims to sell compounded versions of patent-protected drugs when branded treatments are in short supply. There are no shortages reported for the Wegovy pill, which has had an explosive launch since it entered the U.S. market in early January. Hims has said its compounded pill and other GLP-1 products contain semaglutide, despite the ingredient being protected by U.S. patents through 2032. But Novo said it does not directly or indirectly sell semaglutide for copycats, and accused Hims of engaging in illegal mass compounding. "I would just say we do want an end to mass compounding, to unlawful mass compounding," Kuckelman said, noting that Novo is not trying to stop all compounding practices. He said compounding has to be based on legitimate grounds, "as opposed to you producing mass stocks of what you're calling a personalized medicine, which is really just a dosage variation." Kuckelman said some telehealth platforms, such as Ro, "are doing the right things" by transitioning to providing patients with real FDA-approved products from Novo and its competitors. But "some won't, and the only way it appears that we're going to get Hims and others to stop this is through hopefully government enforcement actions and through lawsuits like the one that we've filed today," he said. Novo and Lilly have aggressively cracked down on compounding pharmacies over the past two years as they benefit from the soaring popularity of their weight loss and diabetes drugs. Novo has so far filed around 130 lawsuits dealing with deceptive marketing practices and consumer fraud, Kuckelman said. Lilly has gone through a similar legal process with tirzepatide, the active ingredient in its weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro, which is no longer in short supply in the U.S. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

Both companies have started running advertising in recent years across a number of platforms, including Musk's X, and Starlink has previously featured in Super Bowl ads run by partners such as T-Mobile. SpaceX running its own stand-alone Super Bowl ad is a significant development, with 30-second ad slots costing between $8 million and $10 million on average this year, per broadcaster NBCUniversal. Last week, Musk announced that SpaceX would merge with his AI startup xAI, in a move the world's richest man said would help launch a network of solar-powered orbital data centers to train powerful AI models. SpaceX's recent success has been driven in large part by Starlink, which uses a constellation of more than 9,000 low-orbit satellites to provide wireless internet.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Big Tech stocks were a mixed bag on Monday, after a bruising week that saw more than $1 trillion wiped from their market caps. Oracle climbed 9% and Microsoft had edged about 2% higher. Meta was largely flat while Alphabet lost about 1%. The market grew jittery after expenditure outlooks continued to shoot through the roof in Big Tech earnings last week, as companies doubled down on AI bets. Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta reported a combined capital expenditure of about $120 billion in the fourth quarter alone. Jim Reid, head of global macro research at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a Monday note that last week was the worst for the "Magnificent 7" stocks since April, when U.S. tariffs plunged markets into crisis and the stocks fell 4.66%. Signs of recovery were on show as the markets closed last week, with Magnificent 7 stocks rising 0.45% on Friday, despite Amazon falling 5.55%, Reid said. Cloud companies' growing margins come alongside "potential stock volatility" amid macro headwinds, said Justin Post, a research analyst at Bank of America Securities, in a note on Monday. "But management teams seem confident in their ability to forecast demand and that capacity will be fully utilized in 2026," he added. The markets reacted negatively to Amazon and Alphabet's capex guidance being "well above" consensus expectations, said David Lefkowitz, CIO head of US equities at UBS Financial Services on Friday, adding this "overshadowed stronger-than-expected cloud growth for both companies." Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC's "Halftime Report" on Friday that the tech industry's surging capital expenditures for AI infrastructure were justified, given the "sky high" demand for computing power. Analysts predict room to grow for hyperscaler capex. "As monthly tokens processed grows exponentially, aggregate cloud revenue for GCP/AWS/Azure accelerates, data center commitments expand, and data center component suppliers highlight accelerating demand, we believe there will continue to be upward pressure on hyperscaler capex estimates," Morgan Stanley said in a note on Monday morning.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At America's oldest bank, 134 new workers don't sleep or take sick days. Some of their jobs were done by people last year. "The digital employee works 24/7, which is obviously very different to our human counterparts," said Rachel Lewis, who oversees nine digital employees in addition to thousands of humans as head of payment operations for BNY. "It's really focused on very specific repetitive tasks that allow our human employees to do much more human, intense, interesting-type roles." BNY employs 48,100 humans, down from about 53,400 in 2023, according to a recent earnings presentation. "Our head count has trended down a little bit, but that's not really anything to do with AI yet," McDonogh said. "We talk about, internally, AI is unlocking capacity. We don't think about it in the narrow definition of efficiency. It's all about growing with clients, increasing revenues and optimizing the potential for our employees." Across Wall Street, analysts and investors are starting to ask more questions about how the industry's expenses on AI will translate into higher efficiencies and greater returns. BNY spent $3.8 billion on technology in 2025, or about 19% of its revenue. That's the highest proportion among its large-bank peers, according to data collated by CNBC. The banks are part of that, said Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo. "But you don't define success by who spends the most. You define success by who has the best results." "It's a lot of 'spraying and praying' when it comes to spending on tech, generally," he said. However, BNY has been identified as one of the companies that could see the biggest benefits from AI. Goldman Sachs' research team screened the Russell 1000 for potential productivity improvements, based on labor costs and wage exposure to AI automation. But in several conversations CNBC had with executives at BNY, they've been steadfast that the multitude of technology investments won't come at the expense of human employees. "I wouldn't think about it that way," said Michelle O'Reilly, BNY global head of talent. "I would think about it more as unlocking that productivity – enabling all employees to be productive." Shortly after ChatGPT was released in late 2022, BNY set up its AI Hub. "That's when we really doubled down and realized that this would be transformational for the bank," said Leigh-Ann Russell, BNY's chief information officer and global head of engineering. "Our biggest focus initially was enablement – getting some training rolled out to every one of our employees at the bank." BNY built a platform it calls Eliza, which pulls in a variety of open-source, commercially available models that are integrated with the firm's internal data and compliance. Almost all of BNY's workforce has completed a 10-hour training for Eliza, and thousands more have taken it a step further through a multi-day AI bootcamp that can help non-engineers find creative ways to automate parts of their jobs. "Democratization of this technology is one of our sweet spots on how we feel like we've been successful so far," Russell said.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is transforming the company's culture during his tenure, leaving a lasting impression on some current and former employees. That includes Jeffrey Snover, a retired Microsoft chief technology officer and Google engineer, who recalled an "actionable lesson in leadership" he learned from Nadella in a recent blog post. In short, he said, Nadella stressed that executives need to figure out how to succeed with the resources they have, rather than complain. "If you are an exec and don't have the resources to support your strategy, you have the wrong strategy," Snover wrote. "Quit whining and wasting time trying to get the resources to support that strategy — do your job — get a strategy that can work with the resources you have." In a subsequent statement shared with Business Insider, Snover said he thinks Nadella is "the best CEO in America by a very wide margin."

Snover, who left Microsoft in 2022, said Nadella's speech provided executives with a framework for thriving. "Resource allocation isn't just about money; it's the most effective weapon for killing redundancy and enforcing architectural alignment," Snover wrote. Under Nadella, Microsoft's company culture shifted from being highly competitive toward an emphasis on teamwork, including implementing an evaluation system that rewarded collaboration.</p>

I didn't have lots of bad habits, I hadn't abused my body, and it took me a long time to accept what was happening to me. I considered giving up my dream of solving meaningful problems in tech at scale, taking a career break to focus on my health, and leaving the US to go back to my home country of India. Ultimately, I stayed in the US and continued with my career while making huge changes to my lifestyle and work routine.

I was on a trip with my partner just before Thanksgiving when I had rectal bleeding and felt weak, but I didn't think it was anything more serious than hemorrhoids or food poisoning. My symptoms kept getting worse, even after I consulted doctors and took medication. I was going to the restroom 15 to 20 times a day, and I lost a lot of weight. By Independence Day, I couldn't drive because I had excessive stomach cramps while sitting, like someone was putting a knife in my stomach and twisting it. Doctors noticed my gut was inflamed, and referred me to a gastroenterologist. A colonoscopy showed I have ulcerative colitis, a type of inflammatory bowel disease that causes symptoms like abdominal pain and rectal bleeding. I took three to four weeks of sick leave, then returned to work, but I was completely remote for a year after my diagnosis. My body struggles to absorb nutrients, and I get tired very quickly. I've had to make many dietary changes to manage flare-ups, including cutting out caffeine, alcohol, lactose, chile, and red meat. At first, I was scared to tell people about my condition, but when I started sharing with my colleagues, I found people empathized and judged me according to my merits. I have bad days related to my condition 20% of the time, and sometimes have to step away for appointments and procedures. For example, I have a colonoscopy every year because ulcerative colitis puts me at higher risk of getting colorectal cancer. I always try to catch up with tasks in my own time, and accept that I have to achieve the same things as others in less time. I left Microsoft and started working at a large enterprise software company in 2023. I've come to define success as being healthy, because it helps me solve problems at work better. My diagnosis made me want to be more purposeful with my time, so I started exploring creative passions, like writing a newsletter and technical blogs. I want to connect with like-minded people and not live in a shell. I've done interesting, cutting-edge work in tech, like building important infrastructure.</p>

You don't usually expect restaurant-style service at 35,000 feet — but Turkish Airlines still staffs a 'flying chef' in business class on its longest routes. These rare culinary specialists, who are separate from flight attendants, take food orders, plate meals in the galley, and oversee premium service on long-haul flights. These chefs also take customer feedback from the air to help improve and develop meals in catering kitchens on the ground. I recently experienced the unique service on a 10-hour flight from Istanbul to New York in January. Considering Turkish won Skytrax's 2025 awards for Europe's best business class and best business class catering, I was eager to see how the seat and food measured up. I slept well and appreciated the wide variety of food, from poached eggs and swordfish to a trolley full of savory appetizers. Turkish's Istanbul business class lounge is unreal, with cooked-to-order meals like omelettes and kebabs, drink stations, and sleep suites that feel like mini hotel rooms. My layover time qualified me for a suite, but they're first-come, first-served — I was lucky to wait only about 15 minutes. The bed was so comfortable I slept five hours straight, with a shared bathroom and shower just across the hall. Although it's right by the galley and lavatory nearest the boarding door, I didn't notice much noise with headphones on. Most Turkish business cabins don't have doors. Some A350s do, and the airline is planning a new "Crystal Business Class" with sliding doors, but most planes — including the 787 I flew on — still don't. I could comfortably sleep on my stomach, and I particularly liked the mattress pad and the dual-texture blanket, which has a soft plush on one side. Many of Turkish's old planes still have 2-3-2 layouts that force middle and window-seat travelers to crawl over their neighbor to reach the restroom. I stashed my purse, Kindle, chargers, boots, backpack, and jacket without feeling cramped. Turkish handed out gender-specific kits with lotion, dental items, socks, an eye mask, and a hair tie for women. The case can be reused as a travel bag on future trips. The seat's television was large and fully controllable via a handheld remote. I watched "The Big Bang Theory," "Fast and Furious," and an Agatha Christie-style whodunit called "Murder at the Embassy." Instead of a flight attendant, a dedicated flying chef takes orders, plates meals, and preps appetizer and dessert carts. The cabin crew still hands out drinks and hot towels, but with meals covered, I imagine they can better focus on other tasks. All of the food was served on real dishware and with flatware — no cheap plastic. Turkish offers a "dining-on-demand" strategy that lets passengers choose when they want to eat. For example, I slept a few hours after breakfast before requesting tea, though the crew member also brought me a small sandwich. There were also free snacks available throughout the flight, like popcorn, fruit, mixed nuts, chocolate, cookies, and chips. The breakfast started with appetizers: fresh juice, fruit salad, cheeses, smoked turkey, marinated olives, and bread with butter and jam. I had never seen swordfish on an airplane menu and couldn't resist trying it. It looked a little dull, but it was well-seasoned and more flavorful than the white fish I've had on other flights or even in some restaurants. The other lunch options were grilled spring lamb chops and ricotta cappellacci. Besides Turkish, select Saudia, Austrian Airlines, and Garuda Indonesia flights feature onboard chefs. Turkish's chefs, staffed through catering partner DO&CO, also spend time at meal-prep facilities, providing feedback and helping maintain quality — a hands-on approach that shows in the in-flight service.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Cuban government said international airlines can no longer refuel there due to fuel shortages after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened tariffs on any country that supplies the communist country with oil. The island nation's leadership said Sunday that Cuba will run out of aviation fuel from Monday, likely disrupting airlines operating there, according to EFE news agency, citing two sources. The kerosene shortage is expected to persist for the next month, with all of Cuba's international airports affected. Cuba's Foreign Ministry and the Cuban Embassy in London did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment. The Trump administration has sought to tighten the U.S. chokehold on Cuba since Jan. 3, when it conducted an audacious military operation to depose Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a longtime ally of Cuba's government. Trump, in an executive order issued at the end of January, said the Cuban government constituted "an unusual and extraordinary threat," which required a national emergency declaration. As part of the announcement, Trump said U.S. tariffs may target countries that provides any oil to Cuba, whether directly or indirectly. Gripped by a deepening energy crisis, Cuba on Friday outlined extensive measures designed to protect essential services and ration fuel supplies for key sectors. The plan reportedly includes restrictions on fuel sales, the closure of some tourist establishments, shortening school days, and a reduction of the working week at state-owned companies to four days, from Monday to Thursday. Russia, which holds friendly ties with Cuba, said Monday that Havana's fuel situation was "truly critical" and that U.S. attempts to further pressure the country were causing numerous problems. "The situation in Cuba is truly critical. We are in intensive contact with our Cuban friends through diplomatic and other channels. Indeed, let's say the U.S.'s stranglehold is causing many difficulties for the country," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday, according to state news outlet RIA Novosti. Cuba's foreign minister, Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, previously said the country's leadership condemned Washington's tariff threats in the "strongest possible terms." In a statement posted on Jan. 30, Parrilla also accused the U.S. government of resorting to "blackmail and coercion in an attempt to make other countries to join its universally condemned blockade policy against Cuba." Mexico had paused shipments of crude and refined products to Cuba amid pressure from the Trump administration. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

Stand here and be one with the grass." Every now and again, you'll have a blade of plastic grass going places where grass should not go. Fortunately, we were given some protective goggles. There were definitely times when we were wearing the suits for about six or seven hours because they had to make alterations. There were about eight practices in total, with the last three lasting 12 hours each. It was really cool to see Bad Bunny perform just a foot away. But because he was in LA for the Grammys during some of our rehearsals, the crew had a Bad Bunny stand-in they called "Good Rabbit." I was in a collegiate a capella group, so I'm not scared of performing in front of big crowds. But it's definitely different when you have a stadium full of people vibing, moving, grooving to Bad Bunny's music. I spent about $2,600 on flights, hotels, and a rental car for the two weeks. I'm a content creator without a full time job now, so I didn't have to take any paid time off for this. They made us sign an NDA to not talk about it or post anything on social media for two weeks. So when I saw people posting about what his setlist was going to be, it was so hard to have so much knowledge and power and not be able to do anything with it. I told only a very small handful of people that I was going to San Francisco and would be involved in the half-time show. I didn't tell them where to look for me on the field. All I said was, "You're going to see me.</p>

When Bad Bunny took the field at the 2026 Super Bowl for a historic, joyful halftime show, he wore a jersey with his Latino heritage stitched into its very fabric. It's an apt metaphor for his performance, which eschewed explicit anti-ICE statements (he covered that at the Grammys, anyway) in favor of celebration with a side of symbolism. Nods to the Puerto Rican singer's motherland were peppered throughout the set, which was designed to evoke the US territory's signature aesthetics, from sugar cane fields to a storefront labeled "La Marqueta" (a slang term for market) and various vendors selling tacos and piraguas (shaved ice).

It makes no sense," Trump wrote on Truth Social after Bad Bunny left the stage. For those who understand visual storytelling, however, Bad Bunny's performance made perfect sense. He didn't need to say "ICE out" or declare an explicit political opinion. In keeping with the recent tradition of Super Bowl halftime shows, Bad Bunny used iconography to take a stand instead. Bad Bunny's performance shares DNA with Beyoncé and Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl appearances, both of which used bold imagery to make strong statements. Beyoncé's surprise appearance at Coldplay's 2016 Super Bowl halftime show became famous — and, to some, infamous — for the iconography present in her performance of her then-new single, "Formation." It's not that Beyoncé is allergic to making explicit political statements: She famously performed in front of the word "Feminist" at the 2014 VMAs, and sang "Votin' out 45, don't get out of line" on her 2022 album "Renaissance," referring to Trump as the 45th president. Although Lamar kept the music focused on his own enemies and triumphs, he used audacious visual language to pose broader, poignantly relevant questions: Who's allowed to claim patriotism? What does it mean to be an American, especially in times of oppression and conflict? Bad Bunny's performance raised similar questions, but offered simpler, more optimistic solutions. Bad Bunny is not a politician, nor can he single-handedly cure the world of hatred and division. Still, for a brief moment, on a small square of American turf, he chose to use the stage to show millions of people what that could look like.</p>

Bad Bunny used his Super Bowl spotlight to make a political statement — but not the one many were anticipating. The Puerto Rican singer highlighted the importance of diversity during his halftime show on Sunday in San Francisco, without mentioning Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He also held up a football emblazoned with the words: "TOGETHER, WE ARE AMERICA." Every time Aditi publishes a story, you'll get an alert straight to your inbox!

Bad Bunny was joined by rapper Cardi B, Puerto Rican singer-songwriter Ricky Martin, Chilean-American actor Pedro Pascal, and Lady Gaga, singing her hit song "Die with a Smile." During the Grammys last week, in his speech accepting the album of the year award for "Debí Tirar Más Fotos," Bad Bunny said, "Before I say thanks to God, I'm going to say: ICE out." Singers Billie Eilish and Olivia Dean also made immigration-related statements during their acceptance speeches at the Grammys. The leaders of Minnesota's biggest corporations, like Target and Cargill, called for peace in an open letter to government officials in January. Big Tech employees from companies like Google, Amazon, Apple, and Spotify have signed multiple petitions, urging their CEOs to press the White House to abolish ICE and divest from corporate contracts with the agency.</p>
