                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oscar Piastri reflects on 'tough lessons' and his goals for 2026 Lando Norris 'proved to myself that I have what it takes' after title success With Adrian Newey's maiden Aston Martin design emerging at the end of the Barcelona Shakedown, its dramatic looks have gotten plenty of people talking. From the tip of its ‘pelican' nose to the tail of its rear wing pillar-mounted suspension arms, it's radically different to any other car. The heavily downward-ramped sidepods, housed around tiny radiator horizontal inlets look more like tubes than pods – and are similar in this respect to the Red Bull RB22. However, in this case they do not run down to the floor edge, leaving a huge expanse of floor to feed between the diffuser wall and rear wheel. A big cooling exit duct is incorporated just below the cockpit between the sidepod tubes and engine cover. The front pushrod suspension has its upper rearwards wishbone mounted even further back than on the McLaren, giving the upper wishbone layout an enormous offset triangular shape in plan view. Structurally, this isn't new; several teams – notably Williams and Red Bull – designed cars in the early 2010s with the wishbones attached to a super-strong central mount, with the wing support running around it. Not only does it create a clear unobstructed space for the diffuser exit but it could potentially even serve as a part-replacement for the now-banned beam wing. Although the arms cannot by regulation be aerofoil shaped in profile, they way they are mounted, together with a degree of rake in the car itself could certainly induce at least part of that beam wing function of connecting up the flow exiting the diffuser and that being fed to the rear wing underside. The front wing looks much plainer than those seen on other cars and is probably not the final version. Little is known about the new Honda power unit which drives through Aston Martin's own gearbox (a first) but the progress of this incredible-looking design is sure to be monitored very closely by everyone as the season gets underway.</p>
