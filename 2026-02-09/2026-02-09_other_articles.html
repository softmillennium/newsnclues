                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Steven Spielberg's upcoming sci-fi thriller 'Disclosure Day' has already become one of the most talked-about Super Bowl trailer drops, with fans now connecting its mysterious alien themes to real-world conspiracy discussions. The film, starring Emily Blunt and Josh O'Connor, revealed fresh footage during Sunday's broadcast, teasing a story centred on hidden government material and proof of extraterrestrial life. Soon after, O'Connor's character appears to confirm that the discovery is not human at all, raising immediate tension about what exactly is being revealed. Spielberg then leans into spectacle, showing action sequences on moving vehicles and a looming ship-like object emerging through the clouds. One phrase that has resurfaced in fan discussions is 'sine wave language', a concept sometimes referenced in UFO circles as a possible method of extraterrestrial communication based on sound frequencies and wave patterns. While there is no verified scientific evidence supporting the existence of an alien 'sine wave language', the idea has gained traction in online communities that blend pop culture with conspiracy theories. The trailer's themes of hidden messages and secret material have made it fertile ground for those conversations. In one discussion on the r/movies teaser thread, users joked about filmmakers predicting alien language tropes decades ago, showing how quickly audiences link sci-fi storytelling with broader internet myth-making. This kind of reaction is familiar territory for Spielberg, whose past films like 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' helped shape modern alien imagery. 'Disclosure Day' also marks Spielberg's first summer release since 2016's 'The BFG', signalling a return to the season he helped define with 'Jaws'. Longtime composer John Williams is also returning to score the movie, strengthening expectations for a classic Spielberg-scale event. Spielberg's trailer does not claim to be based on real encounters, yet its themes overlap with long-running alien disclosure myths that thrive online. As 'Disclosure Day' heads toward its summer release, it is already shaping up to be more than a film trailer moment. It has become a cultural spark, blending Hollywood spectacle with the internet's endless appetite for extraterrestrial theories.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Updated on: 09 February,2026 01:17 PM IST  |  Mumbai mid-day online correspondent Sudha Chandran recalled a terrifying paranormal experience during a Gujarat shoot, claiming she sensed an energy pressing on her chest until prayer saved her. Veteran television actor and acclaimed Bharatanatyam dancer Sudha Chandran recently opened up about a harrowing paranormal experience she says she faced during a shoot in Gujarat, describing how it left her frozen and fearful until she turned to her faith for strength. The 60-year-old, who has long maintained she is sensitive to unusual energies, said she can “sense paranormal activity very quickly” and recounted the unsettling night in vivid detail. Sudha explained that after a long day of filming, she reached her motel room around 11:30 pm, ate dinner and went to sleep beside her mother. Sudha said the energy seemed to grow stronger and “growling,” giving her the terrifying sense that it was “entering my body.” In that moment, she said her only recourse was prayer: “I took the name of Lord Kartik, somehow struck my mother with my hand, and suddenly my voice came back.” The heavy pressure, she said, lifted from her chest, leaving her shaken but relieved. In the same interview, Sudha also shared another eerie experience from a shoot in South India, where she said she often heard unexplained sounds at night, “the sound of anklets and the sound of a woman crying.” When she asked those around her about the noises, she said the reply was simply, “This place itself is like this.” Sudha's accounts combine personal belief with spiritual interpretation.
