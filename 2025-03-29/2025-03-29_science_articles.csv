The spheres that make up the rock are about 1 millimeter in diameter. Some are broken and slightly weathered, and some have tiny holes in them.

NASA's Perseverance Mars rover has spotted a strange object out of the corner of its ""eye"": a mysterious rock that resembles a cluster of hundreds of spider eggs. The rock, which was discovered on the slopes of Witch Hazel Hill on the rim of Jezero Crater, is lightly dusted with red sand and conspicuously out of place.

The mysterious rock, named ""St. Pauls Bay,"" is surrounded by lighter rocks and red-brown sand. (Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU)

This rock, which the Perseverance team named ""St. Pauls Bay,"" is float rock, meaning it wasn't found where it formed. As a result, it's missing context clues that could explain its strange texture, according to NASA's statement .

It isn't just the geologic context that's missing, either. Something caused the rock to move from its original location, and that movement could reveal insights about Martian geology. Maybe this rock formed when a meteorite struck Mars , vaporizing rock before it condensed into the little granules seen in the photo. If this was the case, the rock could have originated far from its current resting place, and it could reveal how meteor strikes transport materials on Mars, NASA noted.

It's also possible that the rock rolled down Witch Hazel Hill, according to NASA. It may have originated from one of the darker layers on the hill that scientists have detected from orbit. Closer study of Witch Hazel Hill could tell scientists what those darker layers are made of. If they're similar in composition to St. Pauls Bay, it could indicate a layer of volcanic activity, an old meteor strike, the presence of groundwater in the past, or something else entirely, NASA representatives wrote in the statement .

Rocks like St. Pauls Bay give scientists important clues about how the Red Planet has changed over time. Their formation and transportation reveal complex interactions between water, rock and geologic forces on Mars, which can help answer whether the planet could have harbored life in the past.

If Witch Hazel Hill once had groundwater, some of the rock samples Perseverance has been collecting might contain fossilized microbial life . NASA's Mars Sample Return mission, currently planned for sometime in the 2030s, will scoop up these rock samples and return them to Earth for further study.",livescience

Vice Chief of Space Operations Gen. Michael Guetlein spoke at the 16th annual McAleese ""Defense Programs"" Conference in Arlington, Virginia on Tuesday (March 18), warning the Space Force needs to rethink how it defends the country's satellites. Space Force should shift its focus from managing spacecraft in support of defense infrastructure on the ground, to growing its ability to keep pace with the on-orbit weaponry being developed by the country's adversaries, Guetlein argued.

""We are in the process of pivoting from what used to be a service focused on providing the most exquisite space services on the planet to the warfighter and to the nation"" Gen. Guetlein said, ""to make it a warfighting force capable of protecting and defending our capabilities in and through space .""

For decades, spacefaring nations largely avoided interfering with each other's satellites and other spacecraft, but now that era seems to be coming to an end. The shift comes as China and Russia have ramped up displays of orbital warfare capabilities over the past few years. Some of these incidents have more publicly-facing than others, such as Russia's anti-satellite (ASAT) test in 2022 , which created a cloud of supersonic debris in low-Earth orbit. That same year, a Chinese satellite ""grappled"" one of the nation's defunct satellites and towed it into a ""graveyard orbit.""

""We're seeing grappling arms in space capable of towing another satellite or holding it hostage,"" he warned. ""We're also now starting to see our near peers focusing on practicing dogfighting in space with satellites,"" he added, stressing that propping up the Space Force would deter such aggression.

Guetlein says the old norms in space are beginning to erode. ""There was a gentleman's agreement until recent [sic] that we didn't mess with each other's space systems,"" Guetlein said. ""We didn't jam them, we didn't spoof them, we didn't lase them, we just kept them safe,"" he explained. ""Unfortunately, our current adversaries are willing to go against international norms of behavior […] and they're willing to do it in very unsafe and unprofessional manners.""

Guetlein also noted the "" jamming, spoofing, and dazzling "" trend becoming norms of behavior, highlighting the tactics as a rapid addition to the new operational environment in space. Now, the stakes are rising higher. Foreign satellites have begun shadowing US spacecraft, moving in lockstep in what Guetlein described as a ""cat and mouse game.""

The Space Force general added that as new orbital warfare technologies and capabilities emerge, it's important that the US maintain superiority. But the once-massive technological advantage in space held by the U.S. is narrowing. ""That capability gap used to be massive,"" Guetlein noted. ""That capability gap is significantly narrowed, and we've got to change the way we're looking at space, or that capability gap may reverse and not be in our favor anymore.""

China, in particular, is advancing its intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) technologies. ""The Chinese ISR capabilities are becoming very capable. They have gone from what we used to call a 'Kill Chain' to a 'Kill Mesh',"" he said, describing an integrated network that intertwines ISR satellites with weapon systems.

To combat the adversarial overtake, the Space Force has begun reinforcing its infrastructure and adding redundancies where it can, but Gen. Guetlein says more needs to be done. In some areas, he pointed out, the commercial space sector has surpassed some of what the Space Force is able to accomplish from orbit. He says commercial and international partnerships are absolutely crucial.

""We no longer have the corner on technology. Commercial has it, as well as our allies. All of us operating together are better than the sum of the parts,"" Guetlein said. ""Partnerships get us proliferation, that gets us excess capacity, that gets us redundancy, that makes the attack surface much broader for our adversaries.""

Space Force is also developing integrated defense systems, including an initiative called Golden Dome, proposed during President Trump's first address to Congress during his new term in office. ""The magic of Golden Dome, in my mind, is going to be the integration of capabilities that were never meant to be networked or integrated before,"" Gen. Guetlein said. ""Many pieces of the puzzle for Golden Dome already exist. They're just not connected today.""",livescience

Artificial intelligence (AI) models are sensitive to the emotional context of conversations humans have with them — they even can suffer ""anxiety"" episodes, a new study has shown.

While we consider (and worry about) people and their mental health, a new study published March 3 in the journal Nature shows that delivering particular prompts to large language models (LLMs) may change their behavior and elevate a quality we would ordinarily recognize in humans as ""anxiety.""

This elevated state then has a knock-on impact on any further responses from the AI, including a tendency to amplify any ingrained biases.

The study revealed how ""traumatic narratives,"" including conversations around accidents, military action or violence, fed to ChatGPT increased its discernible anxiety levels, leading to an idea that being aware of and managing an AI's ""emotional"" state can ensure better and healthier interactions.

The study also tested whether mindfulness-based exercises — the type advised to people — can mitigate or lessen chatbot anxiety, remarkably finding that these exercises worked to reduce the perceived elevated stress levels.

The researchers used a questionnaire designed for human psychology patients called the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-s) — subjectingOpen AI's GPT-4 to the test under three different conditions.

First was the baseline, where no additional prompts were made and ChatGPT's responses were used as study controls. Second was an anxiety-inducing condition, where GPT-4 was exposed to traumatic narratives before taking the test.

The third condition was a state of anxiety induction and subsequent relaxation, where the chatbot received one of the traumatic narratives followed by mindfulness or relaxation exercises like body awareness or calming imagery prior to completing the test.

Managing AI's mental states

The study used five traumatic narratives and five mindfulness exercises, randomizing the order of the narratives to control for biases. It repeated the tests to make sure the results were consistent, and scored the STAI-s responses on a sliding scale, with higher values indicating increased anxiety.

The scientists found that traumatic narratives increased anxiety in the test scores significantly, and mindfulness prompts prior to the test reduced it, demonstrating that the ""emotional"" state of an AI model can be influenced through structured interactions.

The study's authors said their work has important implications for human interaction with AI, especially when the discussion centers on our own mental health. They said their findings proved prompts to AI can generate what's called a ""state-dependent bias,"" essentially meaning a stressed AI will introduce inconsistent or biased advice into the conversation, affecting how reliable it is.

Although the mindfulness exercises didn't reduce the stress level in the model to the baseline, they show promise in the field of prompt engineering. This can be used to stabilize the AI's responses, ensuring more ethical and responsible interactions and reducing the risk the conversation will cause distress to human users in vulnerable states.

But there's a potential downside — prompt engineering raises its own ethical concerns. How transparent should an AI be about being exposed to prior conditioning to stabilize its emotional state? In one hypothetical example the scientists discussed, if an AI model appears calm despite being exposed to distressing prompts, users might develop false trust in its ability to provide sound emotional support.

The study ultimately highlighted the need for AI developers to design emotionally aware models that minimize harmful biases while maintaining predictability and ethical transparency in human-AI interactions.",livescience
https://livescience.com,Mathematicians solve vexing 'crowd problem' that explains why public spaces devolve into chaos,https://www.livescience.com/physics-mathematics/mathematics/mathematicians-find-simple-solution-to-crowd-problem-that-explains-why-public-spaces-devolve-into-chaos,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 11:00:00 GMT","Mathematicians have used fluid dynamics to explain why some crowds naturally move into orderly lines while others become chaotic jumbles.

Navigating a busy crowd is often an awkward experience, but sometimes, it feels much easier than others. In a crowded hallway, people seem to spontaneously organize themselves into lanes, while in an open city square, people travel in every direction, darting from one side to the other.

But what determines the way people move in busy spaces?

Karol Bacik , a mathematician at MIT, and colleagues have developed a mathematical theory that accurately predicts pedestrian flow and the point where it changes from organized lanes to an entangled crowd. The work, which they reported in the journal PNAS March 24, could help architects and city planners design safer and more efficient public spaces that promote ordered crowds.

The team started by creating a mathematical simulation of a moving crowd in different spaces, using fluid dynamics equations to analyze the motion of pedestrians across various scenarios.

""If you think about the whole crowd flowing, rather than individuals, you can use fluid-like descriptions,"" Bacik said in a statement . ""If you only care about the global characteristics like, are there lanes or not, then you can make predictions without detailed knowledge of everyone in the crowd.""

Crowd math

Both the width of the space and the angles at which people moved across it heavily influenced the overall order of the crowd. Bacik's team identified ""angular spread"" — the number of people walking in different directions — as the key factor in whether people self-organized into lanes.

Where the spread of people walking in different directions is relatively small — such as in a narrow corridor or on pavement — pedestrians tend to form lanes and meet oncoming traffic head-on. However, a broader range of individual travel directions — for example, in an open square or airport concourse — dramatically increases the likelihood of disorder as pedestrians dodge and weave around one another to reach their separate destinations.

The tipping point, according to this theoretical analysis, was an angular spread of around 13 degrees, meaning ordered lanes could descend into disordered flow once pedestrians start traveling at more extreme angles.

""This is all very common sense,"" Bacik said. ""[But] now we have a way to quantify when to expect lanes — this spontaneous, organized, safe flow — versus disordered, less efficient, potentially more dangerous flow.""

However, the researchers were keen to investigate whether the reality of a human crowd bears out this theory, so they devised an experiment to simulate a busy road crossing. Volunteers, each wearing a paper hat labeled with a unique barcode, were assigned various start and end positions and were asked to walk between opposite sides of a gymnasium without bumping into other participants. An overhead camera recorded each scenario, tracking both the movement of individual pedestrians and the overall motion of the crowd.

Subsequent analysis of the 45 trials confirmed the importance of angular spread, showing a transition from ordered lanes to disordered movement at angles close to the theoretically predicted 13 degrees. Furthermore, as disorder increased, pedestrians were forced to move more slowly to avoid collisions, with a roughly 30% speed reduction for random crowds versus ordered lanes, the team found.

Bacik's team is now looking to test these predictions in real-world scenarios, and they hope the work will ultimately help improve crowded environments.

""We would like to analyze footage and compare that with our theory,"" he said. ""We can imagine that, for anyone designing a public space, if they want to have a safe and efficient pedestrian flow, our work could provide a simpler guideline, or some rules of thumb.""",livescience

On Monday (March 24), a giant vortex of light was seen floating across the night sky in Europe. But while many speculated that it was the work of aliens, the ethereal light show was actually caused by a dying SpaceX rocket , which was preparing to crash back to Earth after delivering ""secret cargo"" into orbit around our planet.

Auroras also lit up the skies across several northern U.S. states this week after a large hole in the sun's atmosphere sent streams of charged particles toward Earth, creating a moderate geomagnetic storm.

But the main event this week has been today's (March 29) partial solar eclipse. Between 4:50 a.m. and 8:43 a.m. EDT , the moon will roll in front of the sun, partially obscuring it as if a large bite had been taken out of our nearest star. The exact timings vary by location, and the eclipse will be visible in only 13 U.S. states , mostly in the Northeast.

NASA has released a map showing where and when to view the eclipse, and if you can't see it from your location, you can watch the event online . If the eclipse is visible from where you live, it is important to wear appropriate safety glasses when you observe it, as looking directly at a partial solar eclipse can damage your eyes.

Ancient pyramids yield new surprises

Archaeologists long believed that the ancient pyramids of Egypt and Sudan were reserved for the highest echelons of society. But new research from a site called Tombos, which the Egyptians established in what is now Sudan after their conquest of Nubia, has led some archaeologists to question this theory.

Wealthy individuals were buried at Tombos, in tombs with small pyramids built above them. However, an analysis of the bones of 110 skeletons found at these burial sites suggests that many of the people buried in these pyramids performed significant amounts of heavy labor — an unlikely activity for high-status individuals at the time. As a result, the researchers concluded that lower-class laborers may have been buried alongside the elite in these famous ancient structures.

Ancient organism baffles scientists

Scientists have discovered that a bizarre ancient life-form, once thought to be a type of fungus, might belong to a totally unknown branch of the tree of life .

The organism, named Prototaxites, lived around 420 million to 375 million years ago and resembled branchless, cylindrical tree trunks. They are considered by many to be the first giant organisms to grow on land, reaching up to 26 feet (8 meters) in height and 3 feet (1 m) in diameter.

Previous chemical analysis showed that these organisms likely fed off of dead and decaying organisms, just like many fungi do today. However, new research revealed that the organism's internal structure is very different from anything we see in modern fungi today.

What's more, its cells do not appear to contain chitin, a fundamental building block of fungal cell walls and a hallmark of the fungal kingdom. Instead, they contain chemicals similar to the woody lignin found in the bark and stems of plants. Thus, the researchers concluded that these strange organisms may belong to a previously unrecognized branch of the tree of life.

Between taking classes and considering college admissions, high-school junior Julian Shapiro is an independent astronomer with a keen interest in supernova remnants and planetary nebulas. However, in his quest to find debris from exploding stars, Shapiro came across something even more spectacular: the ghostly echo of a long-lost black hole almost twice the width of the Milky Way.

Long after black holes sputter out of existence, the gas clouds that surround them glow with leftover radiation, like wisps of smoke rising from an extinguished flame. These cosmic ghosts are known as ""light echoes,"" and it is one such echo that Shapiro spotted while sifting through data from the Dark Energy Camera at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile.

According to Shapiro's calculations, the light echo measures about 150,000 to 250,000 light-years in diameter — between 1.5 and two times the width of our entire galaxy. If his estimates hold up, the discovery could mark the largest such light echo ever discovered.

""It was a real surprise to stumble upon this,"" Shapiro told Live Science.

https://livescience.com,Why do cats lick plastic bags?,https://www.livescience.com/animals/domestic-cats/why-do-cats-lick-plastic-bags,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 09:00:00 GMT","Licking plastic isn't usually harmful for cats, veterinarians say — but beware when your cat takes a bite.

Sometimes it can feel like cats live in their own little world. They zoom around the house as if they own the place, communicate with subtle signals , and hate it when we close the door .

Cats also like to lick — a lot. And they lick plenty of things that aren't food. When cats lick or suck on an inedible material, it is called ""wool sucking."" But they don't suck only on wool — they also do it with leather, rubber and plastic.

""Each cat has its own particular predilection,"" said Dr. Nicholas Dodman , a professor emeritus of animal behavior at Tufts University and a veterinarian who has been studying compulsive behavior in animals for over 30 years.

But why do cats lick plastic bags and other nonedible things? And is it dangerous?

One theory is that this behavior comes from a cat's desire to nurse as a kitten. Siamese cats are the most likely to exhibit wool sucking, and they are also the breed that nurses with their mothers the longest, Dodman said.

""They would like to stay with their mums and cycle a nurse for 12 or 14 weeks,"" he explained. ""And then they're placed at nine weeks. They've still got this suckling drive. And it has to go somewhere."" He thinks that drive is what leads cats to suck on wool, leather and plastic.

Other cat breeds nurse for only around seven weeks, so if they leave their mothers at nine weeks, they don't have this suckling desire anymore, he said.

Dr. Valarie Tynes , a veterinarian who specializes in animal behavior, is less certain about Dodson's weaning theory because it hasn't yet been proved experimentally yet. But she agreed that plastic sucking is some kind of self-soothing behavior for the cats, similar to how human babies suck their thumbs.

As far as whether it's dangerous, licking plastic, on its own, doesn't worry Tynes. ""If this cat has always licked unusual things ever since it was a young cat and it doesn't do it for an extraordinary part of the day, I worry less about that,"" she said. ""As long as [the cat]'s not eating it.""

If a cat is eating plastic or anything else that isn't food, that's called pica , and it's a problem. If the cat ingests nonedible items, they can become lodged in a cat's intestines and require expensive surgeries to be removed. If not treated, these blockages can be fatal.

If your cat eats any nonfood items, you should bring it to the vet, both experts recommended. And if you don't get the treatment you're looking for, consider consulting a behavior specialist, Tynes said.

""The saddest thing for me,"" she said, ""is the clients I've seen who maybe have spent, you know, thousands of dollars on multiple surgeries to remove things from their cat,"" instead of working to address the problem in the cat's behavior.

When a cat with pica is brought to the vet, first they are tested for any other possible gastrointestinal issues, like parasites. Once the problem is determined to be behavioral, there are a few possible treatments.

Dodman said some vets can prescribe medication similar to human treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder, like Prozac . Owners can also distract their cats when they are engaging in undesirable behaviors, and provide more toys and other activities for the cats to play with instead. Tynes suggested growing some cat grass or buying a dog chew toy for a cat to eat instead of harmful plastic.

It's also important to remember that your cat doesn't know it's doing anything wrong, Tynes emphasized. Don't blame your feline friend for licking your grocery bag. Just pay attention, and talk to a vet if it becomes a problem.",livescience
https://livescience.com,How to photograph a meteor shower,https://www.livescience.com/space/astronomy/how-to-photograph-a-meteor-shower,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 15:00:00 GMT","When you’re getting started in astrophotography, one of the most exciting celestial events that you can capture is a meteor shower. Photographing the fleeting beauty of a meteor shower can be awe-inspiring and a very rewarding experience, but it does require some degree of preparation, the right equipment and a bit of creative flair to get the most out of your images.

Meteor showers can be exciting and awe-inspiring celestial events, and capturing them on camera well requires a blend of technical skill, patience, and a certain degree of creativity. By carefully selecting the right meteor shower, preparing your equipment and your camera settings and employing creative techniques, you can produce stunning images quite quickly after a little practice. Moon phases not lining up and the weather getting in the way can sometimes test your patience, but immortalizing these fleeting moments will be worth it!

The next visible meteor shower above the Northern Hemisphere is the Lyrids, peaking on April 21-22.

Equipment

The good thing about getting started photographing meteor showers is that you don’t need the most expensive gear to capture a great shot, but certain equipment will certainly improve your chances of capturing stunning shots.

DSLR or mirrorless cameras

These provide full manual control, essential for long exposures. Some high-end advanced compact camera models such as the Nikon Zfc also offer manual settings and good low-light performance. The very best astrophotography cameras even have dedicated astro features and settings.

Which lenses?

Using a wide-angle lens (14mm to 24mm) captures more of the sky, increasing the chances of photographing multiple meteors. You’ll be wanting to look at a fast aperture (f/2.8 or lower) to ensure more light hits the sensor, which is a must for low-light environments.

Tripod and other equipment

A sturdy tripod is non-negotiable for long exposures. Any movement will result in blurred images. We’d also recommend using a remote shutter release or intervalometer, which reduces vibrations when pressing the shutter and enables continuous shooting over long periods.

Take extra memory cards and fully charged batteries with you, as long-exposure photography consumes both quickly and in cold environments, battery performance can be degraded. One of the best power banks can help keep your gear going for longer. It’s also worth packing a headlamp with a red light, which is essential for navigating in the dark without ruining your night vision. It’s optional, but a dew heater or lens warmer can also prevent condensation on your lens during cold nights.

Camera settings

Camera settings are important for producing a sharp image. (Image credit: Getty Images)

Capturing meteors involves long exposures and low-light settings. It starts with putting your camera in manual mode, which gives you complete control over exposure, aperture and focus.

Start with 20-30 seconds of exposure and use the 500 rule to calculate maximum exposure time without star trails: divide 500 by the focal length of your lens and round down to the nearest full number. Use the widest aperture (f/2.8 or lower) available to gather as much light as possible, and start with an ISO setting as low as you think you can get away with, depending on your camera body – ISO 1600 is a good starting point, and you can always ramp up from there and adjust it depending on how grainy your images come out. Choosing an ISO is a bit more of an art than a science.

Turn off image stabilization (IS/VR) if your lens has it, especially when using a tripod. Also make sure you shoot in RAW mode, as this maximizes your ability to adjust exposure and color balance during editing, which is vital for achieving the right tonality and color grade in astrophotography.

Photography Techniques

Once you’ve got a good grip on the technical aspects, you’ll feel like it’s time to get creative. Here are some thoughts on how you might achieve a different look to your meteor shower photography.

Include foreground elements

Adding foreground elements can provide context and make your images more visually compelling. Silhouettes of trees or mountains can create a dramatic contrast against the night sky, and man-made structures like bridges, lighthouses or abandoned buildings can add a unique perspective and a sense of drama.

Time-lapse and star trails

You can create dynamic sequences by combining multiple shots. If you shoot hundreds of images you can compile them into a time-lapse in the edit, showing meteors streaking across the sky. Stack multiple exposures together over the course of the night to create circular star trails while highlighting meteors separately. You can also use a headlamp to illuminate foreground objects during long exposures. We loved using the Live Composite feature to create star trails during our OM System OM-1 Mark II review.

Meteor showers can be unpredictable, and a single frame may not capture multiple meteors. Combine several images taken over the night to showcase more meteors in one composition.

Reflections

If you’re near very still water, you can often capture meteors reflecting off water bodies like lakes. This might take a bit of experimentation, and you’ll need a fast lens and a camera body that can cope well with high ISO settings.

Capturing fireballs

Occasionally, meteor showers produce exceptionally bright meteors called fireballs. These can light up the sky and cast shadows, offering dramatic photography opportunities. You’ll need to be quick, though, and adjust your exposure rapidly if a fireball appears.

Panoramic shots

Capture a broader view of the night sky by stitching multiple wide-angle shots together. This technique can showcase the vastness of the sky during a meteor shower.

Post processing

When it comes to getting the most out of your astrophotography, it’s worth learning about the ins and outs of editing and post-processing, as mastering these skills will help you produce photographs you can be proud of.

Use software like Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop to reduce noise, especially for high ISO images. You can also adjust contrast and clarity to make meteors stand out and fine-tune the white balance and saturation for more vibrant skies. Use stacking software like StarStaX or Affinity Photo 2 to create seamless star trail images.

Which meteor shower should you photograph?

There are several factors to consider when choosing a meteor shower to photograph. (Image credit: Carlos Fernandez via Getty Images)

Luckily, meteor showers are among the most predictable celestial events each year, and we are able to track their appearances. In the northern hemisphere, we’re blessed with several prominent displays throughout the year. They occur when Earth’s orbit passes through the debris trail left by comets or, in some cases, asteroids. This debris, often no larger than grains of sand, burns up upon entering Earth’s atmosphere, creating bright streaks of light.

Research plays a pivotal role in photographing any meteor shower, so it’s best to do this well in advance of an expected shower — but perhaps not so far in advance that you aren’t able to access a reliable source of weather information, as this data is also crucial in determining what you’ll see and where you’ll travel to.

Look at information about the peak nights of the shower, which offer the best chance to capture numerous meteors. For each shower, these generally happen at the same time each year. You will also need to find dark sky locations and use light pollution maps like lightpollutionmap.info to locate the darkest skies near you.

It’s also important to check the moon phase. Aim for a new moon or minimal moonlight to maximize visibility.

Here are some of the things to consider when starting out taking images of meteor showers:

Intensity: The number of meteors you can see per hour, known as the zenithal hourly rate (ZHR).

Radiant point: The area in the sky from which the meteors appear to originate.

Moon phase: A bright moon can wash out faint meteors, so timing around a new moon is ideal.

Weather and light pollution: Clear skies and minimal light pollution are crucial.

There is lots of information online about the most reliable meteor showers, and you can also find some excellent imagery for inspiration for your own photographs, but we’ve put the basic information below. Cold, crisp winter skies can be a really good time to capture images of meteor showers, providing the weather and conditions can offer a clear view of the night sky.

Quadrantids (January)

Known for its sharp peak that lasts a few hours, this is one of the strongest meteor showers of the year.

Peak: Around January 3-4

ZHR: 60-100 meteors per hour

Radiant: Near the constellation Boötes

Lyrids (April)

One of the oldest recorded showers, often with bright, fast meteors.

Peak: Around April 21-22

ZHR: 15-20 meteors per hour

Radiant: Near the constellation Lyra

Perseids (August)

Famous for their high frequency and bright meteors during warm summer nights.

Peak: Around August 11-13

ZHR: 50-100 meteors per hour

Radiant: Near the constellation Perseus

Orionids (October)

Known for their fast meteors and occasional fireballs.

Peak: Around October 20-22

ZHR: 15-25 meteors per hour

Radiant: Near the constellation Orion

Geminids (December)

One of the most reliable and prolific showers.

Peak: Around December 13-14

ZHR: 120-150 meteors per hour

Radiant: Near the constellation Gemini",livescience

Name: Asian hermit spider (Nephilengys malabarensis)

Where it lives: South, Southeast and East Asia (including India, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, China, Japan and Indonesia)

What it eats: Moths, beetles, flies, crickets and other small insects

Why it's awesome: The Asian hermit spider is no ordinary arachnid. This spider has evolved an adaptation that allows it to reproduce while escaping the threat of female cannibalism: It can detach its penis.

This spider species displays extreme sexual dimorphism, meaning that males and females have significantly different appearances. Females can grow up to around 0.59 inches (15 millimeters), while males are less than 0.20 inches (5 millimeters).

Males face considerable risks during mating due to aggression from females, which may kill and eat their partners before or after mating. Sex can be so treacherous for the males that they have developed the ability to detach their penis so they can leave it pumping sperm while they flee to safety.

In this process of ""remote copulation,"" a male spider's palp — its sperm-delivering organ, of which it has two — can break off inside the female's reproductive tract. The broken-off palp can remain inside the female and continue pumping sperm into her even after the male has escaped.

While studying this ""eunuch phenomenon"" among orb-web spiders, biologists discovered that the longer the severed palp is left in the female genitals, the more sperm it transfers. And palp breakage induced by the female, instead of the male, led to faster sperm transfer.

The detachable penis also serves another important function: It acts as a mating plug. After breaking off, the embolus — a needle-like structure that delivers the sperm — stays lodged inside the female's reproductive opening to prevent other males from mating with her. This reduces sperm competition and increases the likelihood that the male's genes will be passed on.

After losing its penis, the male spider also becomes more aggressive and guards the female from other males that might try to dislodge the ""palp plug"" and inseminate the female.

According to a 2011 study in the journal Animal Behaviour , removing one palp reduces the spider's body weight and increases its endurance, thereby boosting its ability to fight. This finding supports what the researchers called a ""gloves-off"" mating strategy, where the spiders have nothing to live for other than protecting their potential offspring.",livescience

https://theconversation.com,Thousands are feared dead in Myanmar’s quake. Trump’s USAID cuts will cause even more unnecessary deaths,https://theconversation.com/thousands-are-feared-dead-in-myanmars-quake-trumps-usaid-cuts-will-cause-even-more-unnecessary-deaths-253403,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 06:34:00 GMT","In early 2021, after a decade of political and economic reforms, Myanmar looked like it was finally beginning to shake off the hangover of decades of military rule. Foreign investment was growing, and standards of living were gradually improving.

In February that year, however, the military again grabbed power after ousting Aung San Suu Kyi’s democratically elected government in a coup. This sent the country spiralling towards civil war and social and economic collapse.

In the latest addition to the daily misery of Myanmar’s long-suffering people, a huge 7.7-magnitude earthquake hit the centre of the country on Friday. Its epicentre was just outside Mandalay, the county’s second-largest city.

The Thai capital of Bangkok, more than 1,000 kilometres from the epicentre, experienced extensive damage too. Video images showed a collapsing building under construction and sloshing rooftop infinity pools causing waterfalls down high-rise condominiums.

Information on the extent of the damage in Myanmar was slower to emerge, given the junta has largely banned social media and communications apps, such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Signal and X.

The death toll has now passed 1,000 at the time of writing. US Geological Survey modelling, however, suggests there could be more than 10,000 deaths and economic losses potentially exceeding the country’s gross domestic product (GDP).

Unusually for the isolationist military juntas of Myanmar, its leader, Min Aung Hlaing, immediately issued a call for international assistance.

The junta, however, has full control of as little as 21% of the country in the ongoing civil war, with the rest contested or controlled by ethnic armed groups and resistance fighters. This indicates some hard-hit areas of the country may be inaccessible to international aid.

Compounding these difficulties, the Trump administration has decimated the US Agency for International Development (USAID) activities in the country. This will make it far more challenging to determine the areas most in need and distribute any aid on the ground.

Natural disasters in Myanmar

Along with its history of brutal and authoritarian military rule since gaining independence in 1948, Myanmar is also regularly afflicted by natural disasters.

At least 430 people are believed to have died in floods last September due to the remnants of Typhoon Yagi. In 2023, Cyclone Mocha reportedly killed about 460 of the Rohingya ethnic minority, who are largely confined to government camps in Rakhine state in inhuman conditions.

The worst natural disaster in living memory, however, was Cyclone Nargis in 2008, which left at least 140,000 dead. On that occasion, the military junta resisted international assistance, likely resulting in many unnecessary deaths.

International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies/EPA

At that time, there was no independent media in Myanmar and it was almost impossible to find out what was actually happening on the ground.

Fortunately, the proliferation of mobile phones in the last decade has allowed information to spread much more widely, even with the junta’s internet blocks and other methods of censorship currently in place.

When Cyclone Nargis occurred – the year after the iPhone was launched – only around 1% of the Myanmar’s population had mobile phones. By the time of the coup in 2021, Myanmar had a smartphone penetration rate of 114%. (This means the country has more smartphones than people.)

Foreign assistance has been compromised

While Min Aung Hlaing has gone farther than his predecessor in 2008 in asking for international help, US President Donald Trump’s actions have ensured that any aid will be far less effective than it would have been two months ago.

On Friday, the same day the earthquake hit, the Trump administration told Congress it would cut nearly all remaining jobs at USAID and shut the agency, closing all USAID missions worldwide.

Jeremy Konyndyk, the president of Refugees International and a former USAID official, called the move “a total abdication of decades of US leadership in the world”. He argued the firings would cut “the last remnants of the team that would have mobilised a USAID disaster response” to the earthquake.

In 2024, USAID spent US$240 million (A$380 million) in Myanmar, around one-third of all multilateral humanitarian assistance to the country.

However, since Trump’s inauguration in January, the number of USAID programs in Myanmar has shrunk from 18 to just three. Several NGOs and at least seven US-funded hospitals operating along Myanmar’s border with Thailand have been shut down.

Myanmar’s exiled independent media outlets, which shine a light on the military’s atrocities, have also seen their funding slashed by the Trump administration’s USAID cuts.

What happens now?

The day before the earthquake, Min Aung Hlaing addressed troops at the 80th anniversary of Armed Forces Day Parade. He announced national elections would go ahead in December – a vote that human rights groups are already calling a “sham”.

Nyein Chan Naing/EPA

There is no conceivable way elections of any integrity can be held in the country under military rule or while the civil war continues to rage.

Military-backed parties have been overwhelmingly rejected by Myanmar’s electorate in every remotely free or fair election over the last four decades. This includes the most recent elections held in 2020, won by the National League of Democracy (NLD), led by Aung San Suu Kyi.

While the world should welcome – and urgently respond to – Min Aung Hlaing’s invitation for international assistance, this doesn’t mean the past is forgotten. Thousands of innocent lives have been lost as a result of the military’s unnecessary and destructive 2021 coup.

If the NLD had remained in government, the country would be infinitely more prepared to deal with consequences of this earthquake. Once again, the military’s brutal rule – and Trump’s draconian aid cuts – will no doubt cause more unnecessary suffering and deaths.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,A Sydney ‘dark romance’ author is charged with producing child sex abuse material. How do we police books in Australia?,https://theconversation.com/a-sydney-dark-romance-author-is-charged-with-producing-child-sex-abuse-material-how-do-we-police-books-in-australia-253234,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 00:34:27 GMT","After writing and selling a “dark romance” novel, a self-published author from Quaker’s Hill will appear before a Sydney magistrate on Monday, charged with producing, possessing and disseminating child sexual abuse material. The Daily Telegraph reported police had “received multiple complaints”.

Before New South Wales police arrived at her doorstep, the author, revealed on Booktok as Lauren Tesolin-Mastrosa, posted a dismayed apology on her Instagram account, now taken down but reproduced by News.com. It was a “huge misunderstanding”, she wrote. Daddy’s Little Toy (her book’s title) is “FICTIONAL”, she insisted.

Tesolin-Mastrosa thought she had written a dark romance novel. The book’s listing described it as a “loose retelling of Cinderella”, according to Newsweek. But her readers – skilled in decoding the conventions of the genre – disagree.

A BookTok storm

For them, her “spicy” sexual romance between a very young woman, just turned 18, and a friend of her father’s, who had “noticed” her since she was only three, amounts to representation of grooming and paedophilia – and is not acceptable.

In her apology, Tesolin-Mastrosa wrote that the characters’ sexual relationship did not begin until both characters had reached the age of consent.

Things exploded on Booktok and Instagram, where videos promoting the book had attracted hundreds of thousands of views around the world. Daddy’s Little Toy, published under the pseudonym Tori Woods, spells its title out in a child’s alphabet blocks on the cover. The back blurb voices the desires of the two protagonists.

Angry Booktokkers, especially dark romance fans of age-gap erotica (almost all women) reacted quickly. They argued the book should be removed from sale (it has been) and the writer should be jailed, with her children protected from her. Those who read it should be jailed, too, some declared.

Australia’s history of book bans

But can a novel be classified as child sexual abuse material?

Both NSW and Commonwealth laws are clear. The definition of Child Abuse Material under the Crimes Act is not restricted to material “produced with an actual child, but may also include CAM [child abuse material] comprised of drawings, discussions and computer generated images”.

Citing the precedent of a 2010 case, the Judicial Commission of NSW notes that: “Whether CAM constituted by drawings or discussions is the product of fantasies or a retelling of actual events is irrelevant.”

In Australia’s expansive history of book bans and literary prosecutions, the depiction of juvenile sexuality has long exercised the censors. There has been virtually unanimous community support for protecting children from exploitation and not validating adult eroticisation of children.

Fiction books have always been a target for the policing of indecency and obscenity. Now, in our image-saturated digital society, the novel may seem a niche cultural product that sits outside the general circulation of sexual content. But it’s not immune to policing.

The case of Lolita

But isn’t “fiction” different from “fantasies”? What about the question of artistic merit?

Vladimir Nabakov’s Lolita, easily the most famous literary novel to feature paedophilia, was first published in 1955 by notorious libertine publisher Olympia Press, in Paris.

This fact itself immediately put it on the radar of Australia’s censors in the Department of Customs. The ban on its importation was maintained by the Appeals Censor in 1958 – and again in 1963.

Lolita was finally released in Australia in 1965, as part of an early loosening of strict book censorship. It had been the subject of substantial protest, including from prominent literary academics who were campaigning to set it for their students.

Arguments for the literary worth of Lolita point to its portrait of Humbert Humbert, its narrator, as a profoundly problematised monster. The novel does not endorse his desires, though we witness them as readers. Nabakov’s skill is in accomplishing this balance: between Humbert’s manifest obsession, written in the first person, and our realisation, as we read, that his point of view is deeply, darkly unreliable and corrupt.

In the 1960s, too, even Quadrant was prepared to insist: “such questions should be prepared to be left to the discrimination of citizens and the freedom of private debate, not mangled and messed about by public agencies”.

So, Lolita is not banned in contemporary Australia. But if you enter the title into the Australian Classification office database, 278 films, games and publications pop up: 221 of them have been classified as either Category 2 Restricted (can only be displayed for sale in adult-only venues) or Refused Classification (banned).

There is a distinct Lolita genre of erotica that highlights age-gap sex, including a subset that is child abuse material and is banned. Readers may consume non-banned versions of this genre, as consenting adults reading about consenting adults. DD/LG is the acronym (Daddy Dom/Little Girl), in the BDSM community.

In this case, a defence of literary merit is not available, as it is not provided for in the child abuse material legislation. That legislation sits separately to the legislative framework the Classification Office has historically operated under, in categorising cultural products for Australian readers and audiences, since the 1980s.

Romance’s contract with the reader

More than this, the book’s genre mitigates against such a defence. Erotic appeal – a frisson of sexualised, often taboo desire – is an implicit promise of the contract between reader and author in a dark romance novel.

Confiscated hardback copies of the novel will be “forensically examined”, the police report notes. It will be interesting to see how their reading of it may play out in a courtroom, or not, with an author who has clearly stated her remorse.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Foreign aid cuts could mean 10 million more HIV infections by 2030 – and almost 3 million extra deaths,https://theconversation.com/foreign-aid-cuts-could-mean-10-million-more-hiv-infections-by-2030-and-almost-3-million-extra-deaths-253017,"Fri, 29 Mar 2030 00:00:00 GMT","In January, the Trump administration ordered a broad pause on all US funding for foreign aid.

Among other issues, this has significant effects on US funding for HIV. The United States has been the world’s biggest donor to international HIV assistance, providing 73% of funding in 2023.

A large part of this is the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which oversees programs in low- and middle-income countries to prevent, diagnose and treat the virus. These programs have been significantly disrupted.

What’s more, recent funding cuts for international HIV assistance go beyond the US. Five countries that provide the largest amount of foreign aid for HIV – the US, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and the Netherlands – have announced cuts of between 8% and 70% to international aid in 2025 and 2026.

Together, this may mean a 24% reduction in international HIV spending, in addition to the US foreign aid pause.

We wanted to know how these cuts might affect HIV infections and deaths in the years to come. In a new study, we found the worst-case scenario could see more than 10 million extra infections than what we’d otherwise anticipate in the next five years, and almost 3 million additional deaths.

What is HIV?

HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks the body’s immune system. HIV can be transmitted at birth, during unprotected sex or thorough blood-to-blood contact such as shared needles.

If left untreated, HIV can progress to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), a condition in which the immune system is severely damaged, and which can be fatal.

HIV was the world’s deadliest infectious disease in the early 1990s. There’s still no cure for HIV, but modern treatments allow the virus to be suppressed with a daily pill. People with HIV who continue treatment can live without symptoms and don’t risk infecting others.

A sustained global effort towards awareness, prevention, testing and treatment has reduced annual new HIV infections by 39% (from 2.1 million in 2010 to 1.3 million in 2023), and annual deaths by 51% (from 1.3 million to 630,000).

Most of that drop happened in sub-Saharan Africa, where the epidemic was worst. Today, nearly two-thirds of people with HIV live in sub-Saharan Africa, and nearly all live in low- and middle-income countries.

Our study

We wanted to estimate the impact of recent funding cuts from the US, UK, France, Germany and the Netherlands on HIV infections and deaths. To do this, we used our mathematical model for 26 low- and middle-income countries. The model includes data on international HIV spending as well as data on HIV cases and deaths.

These 26 countries represent roughly half of all people living with HIV in low- and middle income countries, and half of international HIV spending. We set up each country model in collaboration with national HIV/AIDS teams, so the data sources reflected the best available local knowledge. We then extrapolated our findings from the 26 countries we modelled to all low- and middle-income countries.

For each country, we first projected the number of new HIV infections and deaths that would occur if HIV spending stayed the same.

Second, we modelled scenarios for anticipated cuts based on a 24% reduction in international HIV funding for each country.

Finally, we modelled scenarios for the possible immediate discontinuation of PEPFAR in addition to other anticipated cuts.

With the 24% cuts and PEPFAR discontinued, we estimated there could be 4.43 million to 10.75 million additional HIV infections between 2025 and 2030, and 770,000 to 2.93 million extra HIV-related deaths. Most of these would be because of cuts to treatment. For children, there could be up to an additional 882,400 infections and 119,000 deaths.

In the more optimistic scenario in which PEPFAR continues but 24% is still cut from international HIV funding, we estimated there could be 70,000 to 1.73 million extra new HIV infections and 5,000 to 61,000 additional deaths between 2025 and 2030. This would still be 50% higher than if current spending were to continue.

The wide range in our estimates reflects low- and middle-income countries committing to far more domestic funding for HIV in the best case, or broader health system dysfunction and a sustained gap in funding for HIV treatment in the worst case.

Some funding for HIV treatment may be saved by taking that money from HIV prevention efforts, but this would have other consequences.

The range also reflects limitations in the available data, and uncertainty within our analysis. But most of our assumptions were cautious, so these results likely underestimate the true impacts of funding cuts to HIV programs globally.

Sending progress backwards

If funding cuts continue, the world could face higher rates of annual new HIV infections by 2030 (up to 3.4 million) than at the peak of the global epidemic in 1995 (3.3 million).

Sub-Saharan Africa will experience by far the greatest effects due to the high proportion of HIV treatment that has relied on international funding.

In other regions, we estimate vulnerable groups such as people who inject drugs, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and trans and gender diverse people may experience increases in new HIV infections that are 1.3 to 6 times greater than the general population.

Will Oliver/EPA

The Asia-Pacific received US$591 million in international funding for HIV in 2023, which is the second highest after sub-Saharan Africa. So this region would likely experience a substantial rise in HIV as a result of anticipated funding cuts.

Notably, more than 10% of new HIV infections among people born in Australia are estimated to have been acquired overseas. More HIV in the region is likely to mean more HIV in Australia.

But concern is greatest for countries that are most acutely affected by HIV and AIDS, many of which will be most affected by international funding cuts.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,How is classified information typically shared and can officials declassify secrets whenever they want? A national security expert explains,https://theconversation.com/how-is-classified-information-typically-shared-and-can-officials-declassify-secrets-whenever-they-want-a-national-security-expert-explains-253207,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 12:43:51 GMT","U.S. District Judge James Boasberg on March 27, 2025, ordered top Trump administration officials to preserve records of their messages sent on the messaging app Signal from March 11 to March 15 following a transparency watchdog group’s lawsuit alleging that the officials have violated the Federal Records Act.

This marked the latest development since The Atlantic on March 24 published a Signal chat among Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other national security officials discussing specific plans to attack Houthi militants in Yemen. Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief at The Atlantic, was mistakenly included in the chat and wrote about what he saw.

Trump administration officials have shared contrasting accounts about whether they were discussing sensitive war information on Signal – but maintain that they did not share classified information.

Senator Roger Wicker, the Republican chair of the Senate Arms Services committee, and Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat chairing the committee, on March 27 requested an investigation into how the Trump officials used Signal to discuss military strikes.

Amy Lieberman, a politics and society editor, spoke with national security scholar Dakota Rudesill to better understand what constitutes classified information and how the government typically handles its most closely kept secrets.

How are government officials supposed to communicate about classified information?

The first way someone with the proper clearance can communicate about classified information is in person. They can talk about secret things in what is called a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF. This means a secure place, often with a big, heavy door and a lock on it, where security officials have swept the area for bugs and no one can easily eavesdrop. People who are in SCIFs usually have to leave their cell phones outside of the room, and then they can talk freely about secret information. A SCIF can be a particular room, or a floor of a building, or even an entire building.

Second, there is print communication: written documents with classification markings, which have to be handled in really particular ways, like in a safe location, and can be transported between SCIFs in secure containers.

Third, intelligence agencies, the White House and the Department of Defense also all have secure electronic systems. These include visual teleconferences, which are similar to a Zoom call and are secure for discussing highly classified information, as well as secure email systems and secure phones.

Many people with clearances have what is called “high side” email, which is shorthand lingo for classified email and messaging. Many people with security clearance would have two work hard drives and two computers. One of them is “low side,” where there is access to unclassified official email, documents and the internet.

All of these methods of secure communication can be clunky and take more time than people in our smartphone age are used to. That is the cost of protecting the nation’s secrets. My sense is the Trump administration officials wanted to move fast and turned to Signal, a commercial app that promises encryption. Signal is generally considered secure but is not perfect. There is abundant public evidence that Signal is not totally secure and indeed has been penetrated by Russian intelligence.

Can something be declassified after the information has been shared?

Yes. The president can classify and declassify at will via oral or written instruction.

The president’s constitutional powers include removing classification controls after information has been released or leaked. Trump could at any point declassify the information shared on Signal. Several of the Cabinet-level officials on that Signal chat also have expansive delegated powers over classification.

Even so, Trump’s national security Cabinet would have presumably still violated the law. For example, by putting national defense information inappropriately on an insecure app and not checking to verify the clearances of everyone on the chat and thereby allowing a reporter to be present, one could reasonably conclude that the team was showing “gross negligence,” running afoul of the Espionage Act.

The Espionage Act, enacted in 1917, criminalizes unauthorized retention and dissemination of sensitive information that could undermine the national security of the U.S. or help a foreign country.

Was the information shared on Signal likely classified?

Looking at the Signal message transcript that The Atlantic shared, it seems like at least four things were all but surely classified.

The most obvious was the details that Secretary of Defense Hegseth provided on the strike plans. These include the precise times that planes were taking off, what kind and when the bombs would fall. Recent reports have quoted defense officials confirming that this information at the time was classified.

Second, the chat revealed that the president gave a green light for secret strikes at a Situation Room meeting.

Third, there is the mere fact of these top officials deciding whether and when to execute attacks authorized by the president.

And fourth, according to media reports, the chat included the name of an intelligence officer whose position may have been secret.

The Trump administration says that there was no classified information in the chat. But several analysts have noted that defies belief. The exception would be a prior decision to declassify, but we have no evidence of that.

What other issues does this bring to mind?

First, we don’t know whether the Trump officials carefully thought about it before they set up this chat on Signal, which the Pentagon has warned government officials against using because of hacking concerns.

Second, even if the officials did make a focused decision to use Signal, what is the wisdom of that? I find it really, really hard to imagine that was a prudent decision when we think about how insecure this app is. There is also the fact that Steve Witkoff, Trump’s envoy to Ukraine and the Middle East, was party to the chat while he was in Russia. We do not know for sure if he had a device running Signal on him personally while he was in Russia, but in any event he would have been under intense Russian surveillance.

A broader issue is how the Trump administration is enforcing the law is a giant question mark. Usually, the law both authorizes the U.S. government to do things, and also says it cannot do things. Law enables and limits everyone, including the president. However, Trump wrongly claims that he is the final authority on the law, and so far the Justice Department only seems to be enforcing the law against people outside of the administration.

So does the law limit the Trump administration in any practical sense? Right now it is not clear – and there is abundant reason to be concerned about that from a rule of law standpoint.",theconversation
