“This is the result of peace negotiations with Putin,” said one Ukrainian, after a Russian attack in Dnipro killed four people and injured more than 20 on Saturday.

DNIPRO, Ukraine — Soon after Russia launched a massive, deadly drone attack on his city Friday night, killing four people and injuring more than 20 others, Hennady Lytvynov, 60, stood outside watching his street burn — and wondering how this war could ever end.

“This is the result of peace negotiations with Putin,” he said, gesturing to what was left of his neighbor's house, struck by one of the drones. “He's not going to do anything. He's going to continue killing civilians.”

“Trump promised the war would end in one day, and everyone was waiting for it. He believed that Putin is a friend of his, but he's an enemy,” he added. “He's an enemy of America, of Europe and definitely of Ukraine.”

The Ukrainian air force said Russia launched 172 drones at Ukraine overnight, including more than 20 at the eastern city of Dnipro. Most were shot down, but one struck a popular hotel restaurant beside the river that runs through the city. Explosions shook Dnipro throughout the late evening, and the restaurant, which was made of wood and shaped like a boat, erupted into a massive blaze.

In other parts of the city, drones or debris hit houses and an apartment building. A pregnant woman was among those wounded, officials said. Russian drones also struck the eastern cities of Sumy and Kharkiv. On Saturday, a missile hit President Volodymyr Zelensky's hometown, Kryvyi Rih, wounding several people.

The mass attacks came just days after Russia and Ukraine each agreed with the United States on a 30-day cessation in attacks on energy infrastructure. Ukraine had originally agreed to a total ceasefire in the air and at sea, but Russia did not reciprocate. Dnipro residents reeling from Friday's strikes said it was clear that any arrangement to stop attacks on energy infrastructure had in no way dissuaded Russian President Vladimir Putin from ordering strikes on other targets, including civilian gathering places such as restaurants, hotels and homes.

There has been major confusion in Ukraine over the terms of the agreement, with Russia backdating the deal to March 18 and suggesting that Washington should lift sanctions in exchange, a term that was not approved by Ukraine and would be seen as unacceptable. Russia also said that violations of the deal would nullify it.

Both countries have already accused each other of breaking the ceasefire.

Russia has said that Ukraine had “virtually destroyed” a gas metering station in the western Russian town of Sudzha, which Ukraine controlled until a recent Russian counteroffensive. Ukraine has denied responsibility for any such attack.

In his daily remarks on Friday, which were published before the drone attack on Dnipro, Zelensky said that he had instructed Defense Minister Rustem Umerov “to present to our American partners all the facts regarding damage to our energy infrastructure caused by Russian attacks.”

In the past day, Zelensky said, Russia had struck gas infrastructure in Ukraine's Poltava region and damaged power infrastructure in the southern city of Kherson. Another Russian attack in the northeastern city of Kharkiv damaged equipment for the city's heating supply, he said.

“All of this shows that Russia will continue to sabotage diplomacy and will continue to act in this way, and that Moscow's only tactic remains dragging out the war,” Zelensky said. “Putin may say things that sound like he agrees with the American side, but in reality, the Russian army just keeps pushing forward with all available military means.”

Zelensky has walked a careful line in recent weeks: trying to caution against trusting that Putin will abide by any ceasefire without irritating Washington, which is plowing ahead with President Donald Trump's goal of ending the war quickly. Many Ukrainians were furious with Trump after he berated Zelensky in the Oval Office and then cut the provision of U.S. military assistance and intelligence sharing. Both have since been restored.

In a residential building next to the restaurant, a Washington Post reporter asked an employee at the concierge desk who had just survived the strike if he had any message for Trump. The man cursed Trump with a profane Ukrainian expression. He said he once liked and believed in the American president. “My view of him has completely changed,” he said.

Across town, Stas Smirnov, 41, stood and watched the house where he had lived for decades burn down. He had stepped outside to buy cigarettes at a gas station just minutes before a Russian drone crashed into his residence  — a random decision that likely saved his life. His young daughter was on vacation in Spain.

But Vitalii, the security guard he had hired to monitor the house, had been killed in the attack. Smirnov would do everything he could to help his family, he said. He still couldn't believe Vitalii was gone.

Meanwhile, Irina Presnikova, 44, was pacing around the block to try to calm down. A neighbor of Smirnov's, she had been at home, less than 10 feet from the impact site. She was shaken but otherwise all right. “I heard there was going to be a ceasefire for a month,” she said. “We had the opposite experience. They're shooting even more now.”

Firefighters ran back and forth to their truck, hauling hoses from side to side. They urged Smirnov to move a car out of his garage before it, too, caught fire.

He parked it down the road, then got out to keep watching as his family history went up in flames. So much was already gone: his house, Vitalii, any sense of safety.

All he could think about now was Guinness — his 5-month-old kitten, named for his deep brown-and-black coat. He had been home when the strike hit, but the fire was still raging and there was no way to try to find him now. Smirnov said he had little hope the kitten had survived — but would not leave until firefighters would at least let him inside to look.

By morning, he was allowed to begin his search. He combed through the remains of his home, checking the smoky, ash-covered basement three times with no luck.

Then he checked again. And there was Guinness, covered in soot, huddled under a couch. Smirnov didn't know if he'd been there the whole time, not visible through the smoke, or if he had found his way there later. He didn't care. He scooped Guinness into his arms, tucked him against his chest and zipped him into his leather jacket to stay warm. Then he dropped him off at his mother's house to recover.

He'd lost almost everything. But not everything, after all.

“I don't care about my building, my house, because it's 25 years old,” he said. “It brought me a lot of happiness, but maybe this is the end of its story. I should write another one.”

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian forces are preparing to launch a fresh military offensive in the coming weeks to maximize pressure on Ukraine and strengthen the Kremlin's negotiating position in ceasefire talks, Ukrainian government and military analysts said.

The move could give Russian President Vladimir Putin every reason to delay discussions about pausing the fighting in favor of seeking more land, the Ukrainian officials said this week, renewing their country's repeated arguments that Russia has no intention of engaging in meaningful dialogue to end the war.

With the spring fighting season drawing near, the Kremlin is eyeing a multi-pronged push across the 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) front line, according to the analysts and military commanders.

Citing intelligence reports, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia is getting ready for new offensives in the northeast in the Sumy, Kharkiv and Zaporizizhia regions.

“They're dragging out the talks and trying to get the U.S. stuck in endless and pointless discussions about fake ‘conditions' just to buy time and then try to grab more land,” Zelenskyy said Thursday in a visit to Paris.

Two G7 diplomatic officials in Kyiv agreed with that assessment. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the press.

Russia has effectively rejected a U.S. proposal for an immediate and full 30-day halt in the fighting, and the feasibility of a partial ceasefire on the Black Sea was thrown into doubt after Kremlin negotiators imposed far-reaching conditions.

Four people died and 24 were injured Friday evening after Russian drones struck Dnipro in the country's east, according to regional Gov. Serhii Lysak and Ukraine's emergency service. At least eight more people were injured when a Russian ballistic missile struck nearby Kryvyi Rih, Zelenskyy's hometown, Gov. Lysak reported. 

Battlefield success is clearly in Putin's mind.

“On the entire front line, the strategic initiative is completely in the hands of the Russian armed forces,” Putin said Thursday at a forum in the Arctic port of Murmansk. “Our troops, our guys are moving forward and liberating one territory after another, one settlement after another, every day.”

Ukrainian military commanders said Russia recently stepped up attacks to improve its tactical positions ahead of the expected broader offensive.

“They need time until May, that's all,” said Ukrainian military analyst Pavlo Narozhnyi, who works with soldiers and learns about intelligence from them.

In the north, Russian and North Korean soldiers have nearly deprived Kyiv of an essential bargaining chip by retaking most of Russia's Kursk region, where Ukrainian soldiers staged a daring incursion last year. Battles have also escalated along the eastern front in Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia.

A concern among some commanders is whether Russia might divert battle-hardened forces from Kursk to other parts of the east.

“It will be hard. The forces from Kursk will come on a high from their wins there,” said a Ukrainian battalion commander in the Donetsk region, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe his concerns.

“They are preparing offensive actions on the front that should last from six to nine months, almost all of 2025,” said Ukrainian military analyst Oleksii Hetman, who has connections to the military's general staff.

Russia entered negotiations with a clear advantage in the war. Now, after recapturing 80% of its territory in the Kursk region ahead of talks, its forces have intensified their fighting across other parts of the front line.

“The number of clashes on the front line is not decreasing,” Hetman said. “If they wanted to stop the war, their actions certainly don't show it.”

Russia ramped up reconnaissance missions to find and destroy firing positions, drone systems and other capabilities that could impede a future onslaught, two Ukrainian commanders said.

“These can be all signs that an attack is being prepared in the near future,” Hetman said.

The Russian Defense Ministry on Saturday also claimed that its troops had taken a village in Ukraine's Sumy region, across the border from Kursk. Zelenskyy earlier named the province as one of the targets for a Russian spring offensive. The Russian claim could not be independently verified, and Ukraine did not comment. 

Fighting also intensified in the eastern city of Pokrovsk, one of Ukraine's main defensive strongholds and a key logistics hub in the Donetsk region. Its capture would bring Russia closer to its stated aim of capturing the entire region.

“The Russians were significantly exhausted over the past two months. During 10 days of March, they took a sort of pause,” military spokesman Maj. Viktor Trehubov said of the situation in Pokrovsk. In mid-March, the attack resumed. “This means the Russians have simply recovered.”

A Ukrainian soldier with the call sign “Italian” said Russia was conducting intensive reconnaissance in his area of responsibility in the Pokrovsk region. Radio intercepts and intelligence show a buildup of forces in the area around Selidove, a city in the Pokrovsk region, and the creation of ammunition reserves, he said.

The buildup includes large armored vehicles, and the many new call signs overheard in radio transmissions suggest that fresh forces are coming in, he said.

Farther south, a military blog run by Mikhail Zvinchuk, a former officer of the Russian Defense Ministry's press section, noted last week that Russian troops recently unleashed a new offensive west of Orikhiv in the Zaporizhzhia region.

The offensive will allow Russian forces to move toward the city of Zaporizhzhia and “force the enemy to redeploy its troops from other sectors, leaving Robotyne and Mala Tokmachka badly protected,” the blog known as Rybar said, adding that the new offensive “could be the first step toward the liberation of the Zaporizhzhia region.”

On Friday, Vladyslav Voloshyn, a spokesman for the Southern Defense Forces of Ukraine, said the situation in the region is fraught after Russia amassed more forces to conduct assaults with small groups of infantry.

Russian analysts project optimism that a future offensive will succeed.

“Both sides are actively preparing for the spring-summer campaign,” Sergey Poletaev, a Moscow-based military analyst, wrote in a recent commentary. “There's a growing sense that the Ukrainian forces may be struggling to prepare for it adequately.”

Meanwhile at the negotiating table, Russian demands have curtailed the results of much-anticipated negotiations brokered by the U.S.

Earlier this month, after Russia effectively turned down the U.S. proposal for a complete, monthlong halt in the fighting, Moscow tentatively agreed to a partial ceasefire on Black Sea shipping routes.

But that agreement was quickly cast into doubt by Russia's insistence on far-reaching conditions that its state bank be reconnected to the SWIFT international payment system, something Kyiv and the EU rejected outright.

Along the front line, the reported ups and downs of the talks fuel frustration and worry.

“No one believes in them,” said the Ukrainian soldier known as Italian, who spoke on the condition that he be identified only by his call sign in keeping with military protocol. “But there is still hope that the conflict will move in another direction. Everyone is waiting for some changes in the combat zone because it is not good for us now. We really don't want to admit that.”

Myanmar Earthquake LIVE Updates: The death count from a massive earthquake in Myanmar has jumped to 1,644, with 3,408 people injured, the country's ruling junta said Saturday. 

The shallow 7.7-magnitude quake struck northwest of the city of Sagaing in central Myanmar on Friday causing massive destruction across large parts of the country. 

India on Saturday underscored its swift response to the devastating earthquake in Myanmar, reaffirming its commitment to being the "first responder," highlighting the meaning of "Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam" (the world is one family).

In a special briefing on Operation Brahma by the Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has committed all possible support from India to earthquake-hit Myanmar, adding that India has always been the first responder in such situations.

"When we say the world is one family, Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, we also want to mean it. We want to prove that by action and therefore, you know, we are very humbled when we have this opportunity to respond to a crisis such as what has happened in Myanmar and extend our support to people," he said.

Doctors in Bangkok delivered a baby on the street outside the Police General Hospital during the massive earthquake in Thailand. The woman was in surgery when the tremors hit on Friday, and doctors were forced to evacuate the hospital. The patient was carried out of the hospital by medical teams and, surrounded by healthcare staff, gave birth to a baby boy, said Police Colonel Sirikul Srisanga, the hospital's spokesperson.

All modes of transportation are continuing, or resuming, normal operations. This includes airports, railways, road, and boat services. A number of sources suggest that today, 29 March 2025, essential services, as well as businesses and tourist service providers, are operating as normal. The areas affected by the earthquake have been limited to certain sites where search and rescue have continued.

While the Thai Meteorological Department (TMD) did report multiple aftershocks, they were at lower scales and did not result in further damage to various areas of Thailand.

The situation has largely returned to normal. At the same time, the relevant agencies, in particular the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation (DDPM), TMD, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA), and provincial authorities remain on alert to monitor the situation and stand ready to provide further assistance.

In a statement, Thailand's Ministry of External Affairs released helpline numbers for stranded tourists.

General Emergency: 191

Tourist Police Hotline: 1155

Fire and Rescue Department: 199

Emergency Medical Services: 1669

DDPM Hotline: 1784

"Foreign nationals who require emergency assistance may contact the following (above) hotlines, or the local or provincial authorities where you are located," the statement said.



As per the XP Division of the Ministry of External Affairs, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) team landed in Naypyitaw on Saturday and was warmly received by officials there.

First C130 landed in Naypyitaw. The NDRF team was received by Indian Ambassador to Myanmar Abhay Thakur and Maung Maung Lynn, Ambassador-at-large, in Myanmar Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the MEA stated.

India is the first to bring rescue personnel in the capital. The NDRF team will proceed to Mandalay tomorrow early morning, and the Indian NDRF rescue team will be the first rescue team to reach Mandalay for rescue operations, as per the MEA.

A severe lack of medical supplies is hampering efforts in Myanmar to respond to the earthquake, the United Nations said Saturday, adding that those affected needed urgent humanitarian assistance.

"A severe shortage of medical supplies is hampering response efforts, including trauma kits, blood bags, anaesthetics, assistive devices, essential medicines, and tents for health workers," the UN humanitarian agency OCHA said in an update.

US President Donald Trump on Friday vowed Washington would assist Myanmar, describing the quake as "terrible".

The European Union said it was providing 2.5 million euros ($2.7 million) in initial emergency aid.

In the chaos of Friday's earthquake, a Thai woman gave birth to a baby girl on a rolling bed in a hospital as it was being evacuated.

Kanthong Saenmuangshin, 36, had gone to hospital for a routine check-up but went into labour after the ground started shaking.

Kanthong's waters broke while she was being escorted by medical staff of the Police General Hospital down five flights of stairs, and she was worried she would give birth on the stairway.

The death toll from a major earthquake in Myanmar has risen to 1,644, the ruling junta said Saturday, with 3,408 people injured.

A statement from the junta's information team said that at least 139 people are still missing after Friday's shallow 7.7-magnitude quake.

Rescuers pulled a woman alive from the wreckage of a collapsed apartment building in Mandalay on Saturday, AFP journalists saw, 30 hours after a devastating quake hit Myanmar.

Phyu Lay Khaing, 30, was brought out of the Sky Villa Condominium by rescuers and carried by stretcher to be embraced by her husband Ye Aung and taken to hospital.

Intensifying its efforts for aiding relief and rescue work in earthquake-hit Myanmar under 'Operation Brahma', India has dispatched two naval ships to the neighbouring country while a field hospital is slated to be airlifted later on Saturday, the MEA said.

Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in a briefing that two more Indian naval ships would follow under this humanitarian assistance operation.

Besides the Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) being sent via aircraft, a field hospital with 118 members from Agra is expected to leave later on Saturday, he said.

India handed over the relief material to Myanmar on Saturday following a 7.7 magnitude earthquake that struck the country on Friday. India's Ambassador to Myanmar, Abhay Thakur, handed over relief material to Yangon's Chief Minister, U Soe Thein.

In a post on X, Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal stated, "Operation Brahma: India hands over the relief material to Myanmar. The first consignment of relief material was formally handed over to Chief Minister of Yangon U Soe Thein by Ambassador Abhay Thakur in Yangon today."

Just a day after a series of powerful earthquakes ravaged Myanmar, claiming over a thousand lives, the nation was struck by another 5.1-magnitude tremor on Saturday, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS).

The latest seismic activity occurred near Myanmar's capital, Naypyidaw, around 2.50 p.m., at a depth of 10 km. The full extent of damage and potential casualties from this new tremor, which impacted the same regions affected by Friday's earthquakes, remains unclear.

Following the initial quake near Sagaing, the region experienced 12 aftershocks, ranging from 2.8 to 7.5 in magnitude, further exacerbating the already dire situation. 

Mandalay, Bago, Magway, northeastern Shan State, Sagaing, and Nay Pyi Taw have been identified as the hardest-hit areas, Xinhua news agency reported.

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Saturday stated that Indian Navy Ships INS Satpura and INS Savitri have headed to Yangon port in Myanmar carrying aid under Operation Brahma.

The ships are carrying 40 tonnes of humanitarian aid for earthquake-hit Myanmar.

In a post on X, S Jaishankar said, "Operation Brahma Indian Navy ships INS Satpura & INS Savitri are carrying 40 tonnes of humanitarian aid and headed for the port of Yangon."

More than 90 people could be trapped inside the crushed remains of an apartment block in Mandalay in central Myanmar destroyed by a devastating earthquake, a Red Cross official told AFP on Saturday as rescuers worked to free the victims.

The Sky Villa Condominium development is among the buildings in Mandalay that were worst hit by Friday's 7.7-magnitude quake, with several of its 12 storeys pancaked one on top of the other.

"Nine people are dead and 44 have been extracted alive," the Red Cross official at the scene told AFP, requesting anonymity.

India is sending a contingent of 80 National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) personnel for relief and rescue works in earthquake-hit Myanmar, officials here said Saturday.

The personnel of the federal disaster contingency force are being deployed under 'Operation Brahma' with quake rescue equipment like strong concrete cutters, drill machines, hammers etc. to provide succour to the neighbouring country.

"A team of 80 NDRF personnel are being airlifted to Myanmar onboard two IAF sorties from Hindon in Ghaziabad. The teams are expected to reach by Saturday evening," an official told PTI.

"Spoke with Senior General H.E. Min Aung Hlaing of Myanmar. Conveyed our deep condolences at the loss of lives in the devastating earthquake. As a close friend and neighbour, India stands in solidarity with the people of Myanmar in this difficult hour. Disaster relief material, humanitarian assistance, search & rescue teams are being expeditiously dispatched to the affected areas as part of #OperationBrahma," says PM Modi.

South Korea plans to offer humanitarian aid worth $2 million to Myanmar to assist the country's people affected by the catastrophic quake, Seoul's foreign ministry said on Saturday. "We decided to provide $2 million worth of humanitarian assistance via an international organisation to help speedy responses against damage caused by the quake in Myanmar," the ministry said.

Six people have died and at least 50 workers are feared trapped are a building collapsed in Bangkok yesterday due to a powerful earthquake. Authorities have sought help from abroad to rescue the trapped workers. They have also ordered an enquiry into the building collapse and formed an investigating committee.

The death count from a massive earthquake in Myanmar has passed 1,000, the ruling junta said this morning, with more than 2,000 injured. A statement from the junta's information team said 1,002 people are known to have died in Friday's shallow 7.7-magnitude quake, with 2,376 injured. 



A massive earthquake struck Myanmar and parts of neighbouring Thailand, leaving a trail of destruction and a mounting death count. As of Saturday, the official count stands at 694 deaths with 1,670 people injured, according to Myanmar's ruling junta.

The death toll from a massive earthquake in Myanmar has jumped to 694, with 1,670 people injured, the country's ruling junta said Saturday. The shallow 7.7-magnitude quake struck northwest of the city of Sagaing in central Myanmar on Friday causing massive destruction across large parts of the country.

The shallow 7.7-magnitude quake struck northwest of the city of Sagaing in central Myanmar on Friday causing massive destruction across large parts of the country. 

The relief material includes tents, sleeping bags, blankets, ready-to-eat meals, water purifiers, hygiene kits, solar lamps, generator sets and essential medicines.

A powerful earthquake centred in Myanmar has killed more than 150 people in the war-torn country and neighbouring Thailand and caused widespread damage.

Here is what we know:

Powerful, and shallow

The 7.7-magnitude quake hit northwest of Myanmar's Sagaing at 12:50 pm (0650 GMT) on Friday at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres (six miles).

It was followed minutes later by a powerful 6.7-magnitude aftershock and a dozen smaller tremors.

Over 150 killed

At least 144 people have been confirmed dead in the quake in Myanmar, according to the country's junta chief.

However, Min Aung Hlaing warned the toll was likely to rise given the widespread destruction across the country.

Widespread damage

The quake caused extensive damage in Myanmar.

There was massive destruction in Mandalay, where multiple buildings collapsed into piles of rubble and twisted metal coated in dust, dotted with people attempting rescues.

The Ava bridge running across the Irawaddy river from Sagaing, built nearly 100 years ago, collapsed into the swirling waters below.

Aid pleas, offers

The scale of the devastation prompted Myanmar's isolated military regime to make a rare plea for international assistance.

Myanmar's junta chief invited "any country, any organisation" to help with relief and said he he "opened all ways for foreign aid".

Offers of assistance flooded in, with India among the first to say it was ready to help.

 

Myanmar lies on the boundary between two tectonic plates and is one of the world's most seismically active countries, although large and destructive earthquakes have been relatively rare in the Sagaing region. "The plate boundary between the India Plate and Eurasia Plate runs approximately north-south, cutting through the middle of the country," said Joanna Faure Walker, a professor and earthquake expert at University College London. She said the plates move past each other horizontally at different speeds. While this causes "strike slip" quakes that are normally less powerful than those seen in "subduction zones" like Sumatra, where one plate slides under another, they can still reach magnitudes of 7 to 8.

Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has offered help to Myanmar and Thailand and sent condolences to its Southeast Asian neighbours after a powerful earthquake left over 150 people dead. "I extend my deepest condolences for the devastating earthquake that struck Myanmar and Thailand. Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of both countries during this difficult time. Indonesia stands ready to provide all necessary support for recovery efforts in the affected areas," he wrote on X.



The United Nations is mobilising relief for quake-hit Myanmar where nearly 150 people have died, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Friday."The government of Myanmar has asked for international support, and our team in Myanmar is already in contact in order to fully mobilise our resources in the region to support the people of Myanmar," he told reporters.While other countries have also been affected, "the epicentre is in Myanmar, and Myanmar is the weakest country in this present situation," he added.

An earthquake of magnitude 4.2 on the Richter Scale jolted Myanmar on 
Friday at 11:56 pm (local time), according to the National Center for 
Seismology (NCS). As per the NCS, the latest earthquake occurred at a depth of 10 km, making it susceptible to aftershocks.The NCS reported the earthquake was recorded at Latitude 22.15 N and Longitude 95.41 E. 

India will send around 15 tonnes of relief materials in a military transport aircraft to earthquake-hit Myanmar on Saturday, sources said.

Pope Francis is showing "slight improvements" as he recovers at home from five weeks in hospital with life-threatening double pneumonia, with his voice notably now stronger, the Vatican said Friday.The 88-year-old head of the Catholic Church is also following the news, and offered his prayers for the victims of the powerful earthquake that hit Myanmar and Thailand, the press office said.

President Donald Trump on Friday vowed the United States would assist Myanmar after it was hit by a huge earthquake that also shook Thailand, with many killed and trapped in collapsed buildings.

Trump told reporters "we will be helping" as images emerged of flattened buildings, downed bridges and cracked roads.

Over 150 people have been reportedly killed and hundreds injured after the six earthquakes hit near Sagaing in central Myanmar at 12.50pm (local time) Friday, state-run broadcaster MRTV said. 

The toll includes casualties from a hospital in capital Naypyidaw - which is likely to become a "mass casualty area", doctors there told news agency AFP 

Myanmar, Thailand Earthquake LIVE Updates: At least 144 people were killed and 732 injured after six earthquakes - the biggest of 7.7 magnitude - hit central Myanmar at 12.50pm (local time) Friday, state-run broadcaster MRTV has said.

Tremors and aftershocks struck parts of Thailand, China, India, Vietnam, and Bangladesh.

The WHO said it had triggered its emergency management system in response to Friday's "huge" earthquake in Myanmar and was mobilising its logistics hub in Dubai to prepare trauma injury supplies.

The World Health Organization is coordinating its earthquake response from its Geneva headquarters "because we see this as a huge event" with "clearly a very, very big threat to life and health", spokeswoman Margaret Harris told a media briefing.

"We've activated our logistics hub to look particularly for trauma supplies and things like external fixators because we expect that there will be many, many injuries that need to be dealt with," Margaret Harris said.

She said the WHO would also be concentrating on getting in essential medicines, while the health infrastructure in Myanmar itself might be damaged.

About 20 people have died at a major hospital in Myanmar's capital after a huge earthquake hit the country, causing widespread destruction, a doctor told AFP.

"About 20 people died after they arrived at our hospital so far. Many people were injured," said the doctor at the 1,000-bed general hospital in Naypyidaw, who requested anonymity.

Rows of wounded lay outside the emergency department of the 1,000-bed hospital in Myanmar's capital Naypyidaw on Friday, some writhing in pain and others in shock after a powerful earthquake.

A stream of casualties were brought to the hospital -- some in cars, others in pickups, and others carried on stretchers, their bodies bloody and covered in dust.

"This is a mass casualty area", a hospital official said, as they ushered journalists away from the treatment area.

EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Friday the 27-nation bloc stood ready to help after a strong, deadly earthquake hit Myanmar and Thailand.

"Heartbreaking scenes from Myanmar and Thailand after the devastating earthquake. My thoughts are with the victims and their families," von der Leyen wrote on X. "Europe's Copernicus satellites are already helping first responders. We are ready to provide more support."

Initial reports on the impact of a 7.7 magnitude earthquake in Myanmar on Friday indicate significant damage in the centre of the country, an official from the United Nations Office on Humanitarian Affairs said.

"We are gathering information about the people impacted, infrastructure damage, and immediate humanitarian needs to guide a response," a spokesperson said.

At least three workers were killed when a 30-storey under-construction tower collapsed in Bangkok after a major earthquake on Friday, the Thai deputy prime minister said.

Phumtham Wechayachai said 81 people were trapped in the rubble after the collapse, which followed the powerful 7.7 magnitude quake centred in Myanmar.

Myanmar's ruling junta made a rare request for international humanitarian aid and declared a state of emergency across six regions after a powerful quake hit the country.

AFP reporters saw junta chief Min Aung Hlaing arrive at a hospital in Naypyidaw where wounded were being treated after the 7.7-magnitude quake hit central Myanmar.

The Stock Exchange of Thailand suspended all trading activities for the afternoon session after a strong earthquake struck neighbouring Myanmar, the tremors of which were felt in Thailand's capital, Bangkok.

"Following the earthquake incident, the Stock Exchange of Thailand hereby announces the immediate suspension of all trading activities," the bourse operator said on its website.

"The closure affects all markets, including SET, the Market for Alternative Investment (MAI), and the Thailand Futures Exchange (TFEX), for today's afternoon session."

In the Thai capital of Bangkok, a 30-storey building under construction collapsed, trapping 43 workers, police and medics said.

The massive building intended for government offices was reduced to a tangle of rubble and twisted metal in seconds, footage shared on social media showed.

Across the border in Myanmar, a team of AFP journalists were at the National Museum in Naypyidaw when the earthquake struck.

Pieces fell from the ceiling as the building began shaking. Uniformed staff ran outside, some trembling and tearful, others grabbing cellphones to try to contact loved ones. 

Roads nearby were buckled and broken by the tremors and the route to one of the city's biggest hospitals was jammed with traffic.

A powerful earthquake rattled Myanmar and neighbouring Thailand, trapping dozens of workers in a collapsed under-construction skyscraper in Bangkok where a state of emergency was declared.

The 7.7-magnitude tremor hit northwest of the city of Sagaing on Friday afternoon at a shallow depth, the United States Geological Survey said. A 6.4-magnitude aftershock hit the same area minutes later.

        İmamoğlu, widely seen as the main political challenger to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's 22-year rule,  was jailed on 23 March pending trial on corruption charges.
    

Hundreds of thousands of protesters have congregated in Istanbul to how their support for the city's imprisoned mayor and demand his release.

Turkey's main opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP) organised the demonstration, the latest in a series of protests that have resulted in hundreds of arrests and have dialled up the pressure on the country's long-time leader, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.

Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu, a key political rival to Erdoğan, was detained on 19 March on corruption and terrorism charges that many saw as politically motivated.

The government insists the judiciary is independent and free of political interference.

His detention, and later formal arrest on corruption charges on 23 March, sparked nationwide protests despite assembly bans, police crackdowns and legal prosecution by authorities.

"They've detained hundreds of our children, thousands of our youths... arrested hundreds of them," CHP leader Özgür Özel told protesters.

"They only had one goal in mind: to intimidate them, terrify them, make sure they never go out again."

Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on Thursday that nearly 1,900 people had been detained since 19 March and pro-government media reported on Friday that public prosecutors had requested up to three years imprisonment for 74 of the detainees.

Police kept their distance at Saturday's rally with no new arrests reported.

Özel called for the immediate release of İmamoğlu, as well as for other political prisoners including Selahattin Demirtaş, a former presidential candidate and founder of the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party (DEM).

"In the Turkey we envision, presidential candidates will not be imprisoned," added Özel.

Last Sunday, hours after he had been formally arrested, İmamoğlu won a symbolic primary to be the CHP's candidate in a presidential election currently scheduled for 2028, but which is likely to take place earlier.

Özel noted they would begin collecting signatures for İmamoğlu's release and also to demand an early election.

Authorities say 39-year-old suffered an injury after jumping a fence when fleeing police and later died in the hospital

A rapper signed to fellow lyricists Future and Waka Flocka Flame died on his 39th birthday in his home town of Atlanta after injuring his leg while running from police and jumping fences, according to authorities as well as multiple media reports.

The death of 39-year-old Young Scooter, born Kenneth Edward Bailey, was confirmed by Atlanta's Fulton county medical examiner's office, as Variety first reported.

In a statement on Friday, Atlanta police – without identifying Scooter – said that they responded to initial reports of shots being fired at a home on William Nye Drive SE and that a woman was being dragged back inside.

“Once officers arrived they knocked on the door. A male opened the door and immediately shut the door on the officers,” Atlanta police lieutenant Andrew Smith said, adding that police subsequently cordoned off the area to search it for a suspect.

“During the process of establishing the perimeter, two males fled out of the rear of the house,” Smith said. “One male returned back into the house. The other male jumped two fences as he was fleeing. When officers located him on the other side of the fence, he appeared to have suffered an injury to his leg.”

He added: “Just to be very clear, the injury that was sustained was not via the officers on scene. It was when the male was fleeing.”

According to the medical examiner's office, Bailey was taken to the Grady Marcus trauma center and died there from his injuries.

His cause of death was not immediately determined, with an autopsy pending.

Born in Waterboro, South Carolina, Young Scooter entered the hip-hop scene in Atlanta at a young age where he maintained a “consistent presence … during its commercial boom in the 2010s”, Variety wrote.

Beside appearing on songs by other rappers including Future and Young Thug, Scooter worked with Juicy J, Kodak Black and Rick Ross.

Speaking to Complex in 2013 about his creative process, Young Scooter said: “I don't really care what I say on a beat as long as it's about some money.

“When you try to think hard and write it out, that's when it's gonna be fucked up.”

Last March, he released one of his latest projects, Trap's Last Hope, featuring songs including Grind Dont Stop, Ice Game, Free Bands and Letter to God.

Across the country men and women have cared for the resting places of their enemy's fallen, finding peace and hope

For some, tending the graves was an act of reconciliation. For others, it was about acknowledging shared losses and shared grief.

Thousands of Germans who died in Britain during the first and second world wars were laid to rest in local graveyards. British people tended these graves for decades, even laying flowers and wreaths for their former foes.

A historian has uncovered new details of this extraordinary relationship, and found that more than 7,000 German soldiers and prisoners of war were once buried in cemeteries near the British towns and villages where they died. Tim Grady, professor of modern history at the University of Chester, unearthed a previously overlooked pile of documents “wrapped in brown paper” in the German War Graves Commission (VDK) archives, which turned out to be interwar records about the graves from the German embassy in London that no scholar had ever consulted.

After the wars, Grady said, there were so many dead soldiers scattered across the globe that people felt that tending to the war graves in their local area was a “tangible” way of overcoming the “horrors of war”.

“If you can do something for the war dead who are close to you, perhaps other people will do the same for your loved ones, wherever they are buried,” he said.

The policy of the Imperial War Graves Commission was to leave the bodies of British soldiers in the country where they had died, too, meaning thousands were buried in military cemeteries abroad rather than repatriated.

Grady discovered that one British couple who lost their son in the first world war tended the grave of a German fighter whose plane came down near their home. “They've got this shared experience of loss that they feel is bonding them together with the other bereaved family,” he said.

Most of the time, however, it wasn't a straightforward reciprocal arrangement, he said. “It was based on a kind of common humanity, coming out of the wars, where I think people wanted to try to build a better future and they saw caring for the enemy dead was a way to do this.”

In Bishop's Stortford, Herts, one family made it “almost their life's mission” to look after the graves of 15 German war dead buried there. “They spent all their money tending these graves – they say they do it to comfort the mothers back in Germany, and as a basis for reconciliation.”

There are even examples of people laying wreaths on German graves on Remembrance Day “because they want to unite them” with British graves, Grady said. Others left flowers or took photos of the graves for bereaved family members back in Germany, inviting them to visit.

Some people also responded to letters German families wrote to local councils in the UK, asking for information after learning a loved one had died nearby. “And so you start to get genuine human contact between the two sides – and that breaks down barriers between the British and the Germans after both wars. That's the initial basis for some form of reconciliation between the two populations that were enemies.”

Between 1962 and 1963 the German government systematically exhumed almost all the bodies of their war dead from graves across the UK and reburied them in a single military cemetery on Cannock Chase, Staffordshire. But its efforts were met with unexpected resistance from British people who had, in some cases, been tending the graves for almost 50 years.

“In one cemetery in Yorkshire, a local councillor saw the German team coming to exhume a couple of these German graves and he threatened to call the police,” said Grady, whose book, Burying the Enemy: The Story of Those Who Cared for the Dead in Two World Wars, was published last week. “He said: ‘You can't take them. These are our Germans. We've been looking after them.' And he tried to stop them. But the exhumation team had papers from the Home Office that say they're allowed to do this. They can't be stopped.”

The graves of the German war dead in Britain played a crucial role in restoring relations between the countries after the world wars, Grady said.

One RAF commander filled 12 wooden urns with soil from German graves near his base in Sussex, and sent the urns to the bereaved German families of those who were buried there. “One of them was an unknown pilot, so they couldn't trace his family. The VDK has still got that urn sitting in its archive.”

In Poole, Dorset, a British man who lived opposite a cemetery bumped into the widow of a Nazi bomber who had been shot down and buried there. “She was visiting her husband's grave after the war.” After meeting at the graveside, they stayed in contact, exchanging Christmas cards and letters. “He tends the grave, laying flowers there and writing to her about how the grave is. He even ends up going over to Germany on holiday, and stays with her and her new husband.”

In Montrose, Scotland, “lots of local people” welcomed the mother of a Nazi killed nearby in a plane crash, when she visited her son's grave in the early 1950s. “Somebody wanted to drive her to the cemetery, somebody wanted to find her a hotel, someone else wanted to take her out for dinner. All to show her: we're no longer enemies, we understand your loss, let's work together.”

Such connections were important for Anglo-German relations, Grady said, as they involved ordinary people and their communities. “Because the enemy bodies were buried locally, it forced people locally to recognise that the other side also experienced loss.”

Defense secretary, already under fire for chat group blunder, faces new scrutiny for having wife in high-level meetings

The wife of the US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, attended two meetings with foreign defense officials during which sensitive information was discussed, according to a new report from the Wall Street Journal.

The Journal's report on Hegseth arrived late on Friday as he faced scrutiny for detailing plans of a military strike in a group chat on Signal, made public by a journalist at the Atlantic who was added to the chat. Multiple Democrats have called for his resignation while a bipartisan group of senators sent a letter to the defense department calling for an inquiry into the group chat.

Hegseth's wife, Jennifer Hegseth, has been present at two meetings where sensitive information was discussed, according to the Journal, citing multiple people who were present at the meetings or have knowledge of her presence at them.

The first meeting reportedly was a high-level discussion at the Pentagon with top UK military officials, including the UK secretary of defense, John Healey, that took place in early March, a day after the US announced it would stop sharing military intelligence with Ukraine.

The second reportedly took place in Brussels in mid-February at Nato headquarters during a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, a forum of about 50 nations meant to help coordinate military support for Ukraine as it tries to fight off the invasion Russia launched in 2022.

A defense secretary has the discretion to invite anyone to meetings with foreign counterparts, but officials cited by the Journal said that those attending these types of meetings usually have high-level security clearances. While the spouses of defense officials sometimes receive low-level security clearances, it is unclear whether Hegseth's wife has any clearance.

Hegseth's wife is a former producer of the network television show Fox & Friends, where Hegseth was a co-host starting in 2017. The couple married in 2019.

Hegseth also brought his brother Philip Hegseth a podcast producer, on official visits, according to the Journal. Philip Hegseth accompanied his brother to Guantánamo Bay and is currently with him during Hegseth's tour of Asia.

The defense department did not immediately respond to a Guardian request for comment. In a statement to the Journal, department spokesperson Sean Parnell said that it is “pretty clear to me that [the Journal's] story is going to be filled with inaccuracies and will not be written in good faith”.

Chuck Hagel, an former Republican secretary of defense who served under former president Barack Obama, told the Journal that national security officials have to be careful about whom they invite to meetings with foreign counterparts.

“If you are going to discuss top secret, national security issues, you have to be very selective,” Hagel said. “What's the relevancy of the person you are inviting?”

Though the Pentagon has largely pinned the blame for the Signal group chat leak on the national security adviser, Mike Waltz, Hegseth's ability to handle the sensitive nature of his job as the top military official in the country has also been called into question. On Thursday, a federal judge ordered officials, including Hegseth, to preserve all messages in the Signal group chat.

Republicans have largely defended Hegseth and have brushed off the group chat fiasco in public. But reports suggest that there are some who are privately concerned about Hegseth's conduct.

“You're not going to hear a huge public outcry,” an anonymous GOP official told Politico. “But privately, there is a lot of concern about his judgment.”

Skygazers across countries in the Northern Hemisphere gathered to catch a glimpse of the partial solar eclipse on Saturday.

According to a PA Media report, the eclipse peaked in London at around 11am (local time) and was visible in parts of the country from between around 10am and noon.

Robert Massey, deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, told PA Media,“There's a really nice crowd of people, everybody's really excited, there's people wearing eclipse glasses, looking through the telescopes we've got set up. We're loving it and it's a lot of fun. It's a great public atmosphere, it's a really nice event."

Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill said: “The further north west you are in the UK the more of an eclipse you are likely to have, whereas towards the south east it's a little bit less – but still 30%, and still a large chunk taken out of the Sun.”

“There's a huge amount of enthusiasm about it. As expected, the Moon started moving in front of the Sun about an hour ago; it's got a bit under an hour to go and it's blocking out some of the Sun,” he added.

Astronomer Imo Bell, at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said,“There's been nothing unexpected, but that's the cool thing, we've known this has been coming for a very long time. We have the technology and the understanding of space now to predict these things almost to the second.

 



The solar eclipse was also visible in Spain, Russia, Italy, Portugal and other countries of Northern Hemisphere.

An X user in United States' Maine shared pictures of partial solar eclipse.

 

Eclipses occur when the Sun, Moon and Earth all line up. When they perfectly align for a total solar eclipse, the Moon fully blots out the Sun's disc, creating an eerie twilight here on Earth.

But that will not happen during Saturday's partial eclipse, which will instead turn the Sun into a crescent.

"The alignment is not perfect enough for the cone of shadow to touch the Earth's surface," Paris Observatory astronomer Florent Deleflie told AFP.

A greater spectacle is expected on August 12, 2026, when a total solar eclipse will be visible in Iceland, northern Spain and parts of Portugal.

Chloe Kim won her third snowboard halfpipe world championship Saturday in St Moritz, Switzerland, and secured a spot on the 2026 US Olympic team.

Kim, 24, landed a switch double cork 1080 and back-to-back 900s in her first run to earn a score of 93.50, enough to clinch the title with one run remaining. Japan's Sara Shimizu took silver with 90.75, while Mitsuki Ono earned bronze with 88.50.

“I think I'm back,” Kim said. “I really started to find the joy for the sport again, and that's been a really positive change for me.”

The victory guarantees Kim's place at the Milano Cortina Olympics next February, where she will attempt to become the first snowboarder to win three consecutive Olympic gold medals in halfpipe.

Kim's win caps a comeback season after a two-year break from competition. She stepped away following her second Olympic gold at the 2022 Beijing Games, citing mental health struggles and burnout. After returning to competition in January, she won the X Games in Aspen – tying Shaun White for most women's SuperPipe titles – and became the first woman to land both frontside and cab double cork 1080s in competition.

Saturday's final was delayed more than two hours due to poor weather. Kim acknowledged the conditions took a toll on the riders.

“Today was definitely a big mental battle, I think for all the ladies,” she said. “I definitely had a couple mental breakdowns during practice, so I'm just really happy I was able to land something.”

Her second run served as a victory lap, during which she attempted a cab 1260 – another trick no woman has landed in competition – but fell on the landing.

“My favorite part about a victory lap is trying to progress the sport and try to do the craziest run I've ever done,” Kim said. “I was hoping to put that down here, but next time.”

Kim first won the world championship in 2019 and repeated in 2021. She did not compete at the 2023 edition.

The win also solidified her status atop the World Snowboard Points List, the key criteria for early Olympic qualification. According to US Ski and Snowboard, the top-ranked American woman in the world standings after this event secures an automatic Olympic berth, provided she remains in the top three overall – a threshold Kim has met.

Kim won her first X Games gold at age 14 and a first Olympic gold at 17 in Pyeongchang. She remains one of the most dominant and decorated athletes in the sport.

“Chloe's ability to push the progression of women's halfpipe riding while staying consistent at the top is remarkable,” said US Snowboard head coach Danny Kass. “She's not just winning – she's reinventing what's possible.”

Kim has credited her renewed success to changes she made off the snow. She began intensive therapy last summer, a move she says helped her regain her confidence and perspective.

“There was a time I couldn't imagine competing again,” Kim said earlier this season. “Now, I'm having fun again. I've let go of what I think I'm supposed to do and just focus on what I love about snowboarding.”

The remainder of the US women's Olympic halfpipe team will be named in early 2026.

Skygazers are looking up as a partial solar eclipse gets under way

"It was a beautiful experience," Tom Pocko from Manchester tells the BBC as he sends us the picture he took

Remember, it's dangerous to look straight at the Sun – here's how to watch it safely

The astronomical event has now ended in the UK and some areas - Missed it? Watch our video

We've also got an explainer for you on what a solar eclipse is – and why it happens

Edited by Tinshui Yeung, with Rebecca Morelle reporting from the Royal Observatory

Lana LamLive reporter

Skywatchers across the UK and beyond were treated to a stunning sight today as a partial solar eclipse dazzled the skies for several hours.

From the Royal Observatory in Greenwich to Warwickshire and all the way up to Manchester, people watched as the Moon moved in front of the Sun, stirring up a range of emotions.

We even got a great view from Nuuk, the capital of Greenland.

While not a rare event, it was a special treat to see it from here in the UK. Some called it “humbling”, others “beautiful” – and one youngster said the sun looked like Pac-Man with a bite taken out of it.

If you missed it, you can scroll back through our live coverage. And don't worry – there's another one coming in August 2026.

We're closing our live coverage now. Thanks for joining us this nice morning.

We're about to wrap up our live coverage for today, but before we go, here are a few more photos of the partial solar eclipse.

They show how photographers have been getting creative with this astronomical event.

Now that it's past noon, the partial solar eclipse in the UK has come to an end.

Here are some of the photos you - our readers - sent in earlier.

This picture was taken in Guildford, Surrey, using a smartphone with a pair of solar glasses held in front of the phone camera lens

Andrew Clarke took this picture in Poole, Dorset. He says: “I really wanted to share it with my fiancé Abbe as we both love stargazing, but she's on her way to a wedding dress fitting and I'm refurbishing our old boat in Poole. I took this picture for her”

“It's always humbling to see any solar or lunar eclipse!” says Tom Hurley, who took this photo from his garden in Exmouth, Devon

We've been speaking to some of the viewers who made their way to the Royal Observatory in Greenwich to catch the partial solar eclipse.

Elizabeth Binney is visiting London from Thailand and headed to Greenwich this morning with a running group.

"It's such a buzz, I didn't think this was going to be part of my Saturday morning," she tells the BBC, adding "it'll be one of my memories of my time in London".

Priyanka Prasher, originally from Birmingham and now living in London, says it's a lovely atmosphere.

"It's bringing good vibes... and it's a nice symbol of saying hello to spring," she says.

"My mum is visiting so I thought it would be a really nice experience to mark the occasion with the solar eclipse just before Mother's Day."

I've just been speaking to a couple of astronomers from the Royal Observatory.

"It's really exciting because it's something that everyone can see," says Bryony Lanigan, by using eclipse glasses or a pinhole projector. 

"We always associate the moon with the night, the sun with the day but that's not really the way it works," she says.

"Our moon goes around us, we go around the sun - and at times, it all lines up so that one covers the other as it is right now."

Fellow astronomer Anna Gammon-Ross says partial eclipses aren't that rare and the UK is in a good position to see this one.

As we've said, it's dangerous to look at a partial solar eclipse with the naked eye.

But there are plenty of other ways to watch it safely – just like the people below.

Rebecca MorelleScience editor, reporting from the Royal Observatory in Greenwich

The eclipse is past its peak now, and the shadow of the Moon is now moving to the top of the Sun.

The skies became a little hazy at the peak, but the view was still crystal clear through my safety glasses.

The crowd at the Royal Observatory Greenwich have loved it – describing it as magical and spectacular.

One boy called Jack said the Sun looked a bit like PacMan.

Many people across the UK are seizing the chance to snap photos of the partial solar eclipse.

That includes Tom Pocko, who took this picture in Didsbury, south Manchester, using a 400mm lens with two ND (neutral density) filters. 

“It was a beautiful experience. I feel very lucky to have seen it and been able to capture such a rare natural phenomenon. Especially in good weather conditions for Manchester (which is unusual),” he tells the BBC.

Here's a photo of the partial solar eclipse taken just before the FA Cup quarter-final between Fulham and Crystal Palace at Craven Cottage in London.

It's just a spectacular sight, seeing the sun appearing as a crescent and the moon taking a little nibble out of the side.

We've had really good weather here this morning. It's hazed over very slightly in the last few minutes but it's still a lovely view to see.

The views are differing across the UK - in the Outer Hebrides it's about 47% and in the southeast, it goes down to 28%.

We've just heard from Chris Lintott, a professor of astrophysics at Oxford University, who's watching the partial eclipse in Oxford using special glasses. (Remember, it's not safe to look at the eclipse with the naked eye.)

"We can see probably about 25 to 30% of the sun's disc is now covered by the moon, which is making a slow and stately progress across the face," he says.

"This is just fun... I think there's something nice about seeing the machinery of the solar system unfold.

"About 40 per cent of the sun will be covered in about 15 minutes or so."

Lintott says partial solar eclipses happen a "few times a year", so they're not rare – and there's a good one next August for most of Europe.

Here's an image of the partial solar eclipse seen from Warwickshire earlier.

The "bite mark" in the Sun made by the Moon is bigger now as the eclipse reaches its peak.

We'll bring you more pictures soon.

We're approaching the peak of the partial solar eclipse and, if you're looking through solar glasses, it looks as though a chunk of the sun has been bitten off.

There are lots of people here watching the eclipse through telescopes and pinhole cameras, and there's a great atmosphere with plenty of excitement in the crowd.

Emma CalderLive reporter

Cloud cover isn't stopping local astronomers from heading out.

At the top of London's Primrose Hill, a small crowd has gathered, chatting excitedly as they gaze up at the sky.

There's a bit of a cloudy haze right now, but spirits are high and people are getting ready for the peak.

I'm here in Nuuk, Greenland, and the view of the partial eclipse is stunning.

The moon has almost completely covered the sun, and you can see that gorgeous crescent shape through the clouds.

Rebecca MorelleScience editor

The partial eclipse has begun – you can see the Moon taking a tiny nibble from the top right-hand edge of the Sun.

At the Royal Observatory Greenwich, there were plenty of oohs and aahs as people put on their safety glasses to watch the spectacle.

Here's the first image we've got of the partial solar eclipse in Dakar, Senegal.

Rebecca MorelleScience editor

We're at the Royal Observatory Greenwich this morning - it's a gorgeous sunny day here - and we're poised with our safety glasses and special tracking camera with solar filters so we can watch the eclipse as it happens.

At the ready for the celestial spectacle.

It's 10:07 GMT and the partial solar eclipse has begun.

You might not be able to see much of a difference on the live feed just yet, but we'll bring you images of the event as soon as we get them.

        The White House called the service, which has existed since 1942, 'The Voice of Radical America' and said Trump's order would 'ensure that taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda.'
    

A federal judge has halted the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the US international broadcaster Voice of America, calling the move a "classic case of arbitrary and capricious decision making."

Judge James Paul Oetken blocked the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which runs Voice of America, from firing more than 1,200 journalists, engineers and other staff that it sidelined two weeks ago in the wake of President Donald Trump ordering its funding slashed.

Oetken issued a temporary restraining order barring the agency from "any further attempt to terminate, reduce-in-force, place on leave, or furlough" employees or contractors, and from closing any offices or requiring overseas employees to return to the US.

The order also bars the USAGM from terminating grant funding for its other broadcast outlets, including Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia and Radio Free Afghanistan.

The agency said on Thursday it was restoring Radio Free Europe's funding after a judge in Washington DC ordered it to do so.

"This is a decisive victory for press freedom and the First Amendment, and a sharp rebuke" to the Trump administration's "utter disregard for the principles that define our democracy," said the plaintiffs' lawyer, Andrew G. Celli Jr.

At a hearing Friday in Manhattan on Friday, Oetken faulted the Trump administration for "taking a sledgehammer to an agency that has been statutorily authorised and funded by Congress."

The judge criticised the agency's leadership, including special adviser Kari Lake, for pulling the plug "seemingly overnight" on the US government's global, soft-power platform with "no consideration of the effects."

Oetken ruled after a coalition of Voice of America journalists, labour unions and the nonprofit journalism advocacy group Reporters Without Borders sued the Trump administration last week to block the cuts.

Ultimately, they seek to have VOA return to the air.

The plaintiffs argued the shutdown violated a court's finding during Trump's first term that VOA journalists have a free-speech firewall protecting them from White House interference.

Their absence from the airwaves has left a vacuum that's being filled by "propagandists whose messages will monopolise global airwaves," the complainants said.

Trump and other Republicans have accused Voice of America of a "leftist bias" and failing to project "pro-American" values to its worldwide audience, even though it is mandated by congress to serve as a non-partisan news organisation.

Voice of America went off the air soon after Trump issued an executive order on 14 March that pared funding to the USAGM and six other unrelated federal entities, part of his campaign to shrink government and align its with his political agenda.

The White House called the service, which has existed since 1942, "The Voice of Radical America" and said Trump's order would "ensure that taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda."

It cited coverage it claimed was "too favourable" to former President Joe Biden, as well as stories about white privilege, racial profiling and transgender migrants seeking asylum.

Congress has appropriated nearly $860 million (€794 million) for the USAGM for the current fiscal year.

A directive targeting French companies with US government contracts has raised concerns about the widening reach of President Donald Trump's policies abroad. With transatlantic relations already under strain, French officials are pushing back, questioning the implications of Washington's hardline approach.

The Trump administration has issued a directive to French companies holding US government contracts, instructing them to comply with an executive order that bans diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes.

The firms have reportedly been asked to confirm their compliance by completing a separate questionnaire entitled "Certification Regarding Compliance With Applicable Federal Anti-Discrimination Law."

This move is likely to ruffle feathers in European boardrooms, as concerns mount that the Trump administration is expanding its crackdown on DEI initiatives beyond US borders.

The directive comes at a time when President Donald Trump's stance on tariffs and security cooperation has already shaken transatlantic relations.

French business daily Les Echos first reported on Friday that the letter had been dispatched to firms by the US mission in Paris, posting on X: "Several dozen French companies have received a letter from the US embassy".

UN rights chief deeply worried about 'fundamental shift' in direction in US

The letter further requests that recipients sign and return the document in English within five days.

A powerful, deadly earthquake struck at the heart of civil war-ravaged Myanmar on Friday, piling fresh misery on an impoverished nation that was cut off from much of the world even before this natural disaster struck.

The timing could hardly be worse. The Southeast Asian country is reeling from a raging civil war between a military junta that seized power in 2021, and pro-democracy fighters and ethnic rebel groups battling to overthrow it.

The war – now in its fifth year – has ravaged communications and transport in Myanmar, making it particularly difficult to get a clear picture of the damage.

The country's military government says more than 1,600 people have died so far. But experts fear the real toll will be far higher and could take weeks to emerge.

Here's what we know so far.

On Saturday fragments emerged showing the destruction wrought by the quake from former royal capital Mandalay, home to around 1.5 million people and the city closest to its epicenter.

Residents of the city known for its Buddhist monasteries and a sprawling palace told CNN of homes, offices, mosques and monasteries collapsing and roads to the city ruptured by quake – which unleashed energy equivalent to “334 atomic bombs,” according to one geologist.

And they spoke of desperately rushing injured loved ones to medical care – or the agonizing wait for news of friends still missing or trapped under the rubble.

CNN managed to reach one woman living in Mandalay who recalled the terrifying moment a family member was buried by rubble. She asked not to be named.

“It hit very strong and very fast,” she said of the earthquake. She recalled she was boiling water to make milk for her baby when the 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck not far from her home to the east of the city.

Part of the wall of the house collapsed onto the woman's grandmother who was sitting nearby, burying her legs in rubble and debris, she said.

“The door couldn't open as a fence had collapsed onto it. I shouted out for help and my husband came in from the street. He jumped on the door and managed to open it.”

A former lawyer in the city who did not want to give his name, told CNN three members of his wife's family had been killed in the quake.

“Until now, we have not been able to recover their dead bodies from rubble,” he said.

The quake also shattered some of the city's mosques which were busy with worshippers attending Friday prayers, one man said.

“When the buildings collapsed, many Muslims got trapped inside, causing casualties and deaths… In one mosque, there are more than a hundred injured.”

Across the mighty Irrawaddy river that runs past Mandalay, there is also destruction in Sagaing region, a more rural area, where many live in more flimsy – but more earthquake survivable – wooden and thatched houses.

Nang Aye Yin, 34, heard news that the nunnery where a relative of his was studying had collapsed.

“Luckily no one died, but two were badly wounded. One of my nieces aged 11 lost three toes and another nun had her head broken as well as one of her legs.”

Hospitals in both Sagaing and Mandalay turned them away as they were already at full capacity, he said.

Meanwhile, civilians and rescue teams have been raising complaints that a shortage of heavy machinery, as well as a lack of assistance from the military government, have been hampering rescue efforts.

Civilians in Mandalay say they have instead resorted to scrambling through the dirt with their bare hands to look for survivors. “There's too much rubble, and no rescue teams have come for us,” one survivor told Reuters.

Myanmar's military junta seized power in a 2021 coup after a brief 10-year experiment with democracy. Before that, Myanmar's generals ruled for decades. And generally, whenever disaster struck, they would eschew foreign help and play down the impact.

This time it's different.

Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing took the unusual step of quickly asking for foreign aid. He visited the city of Mandalay on Saturday to inspect the damage, state media reported, as well as the capital Naypyidaw which was also hit hard.

On Saturday several neighboring countries began sending rescue teams and aid.

A team from China – historically one of the junta's closest partners – were the first to arrive, touching down in Myanmar's commercial hub Yangon bringing relief supplies, Chinese state media said.

Singapore, Malaysia, India and Russia also announced they would send help.

But for those in quake-stricken Mandalay, around 380 miles away and with transportation uncertain, the wait driving them mad.

“My head is going to explode while waiting for calls for friends who cannot be found yet,” the former lawyer said.

The earthquake is the most powerful to hit Myanmar in a century.

“The force that a quake like this releases is about 334 atomic bombs,” geologist Jess Phoenix told CNN.

Another seismologist said that the quake was like a “great knife cut into the Earth.”

James Jackson, from the University of Cambridge in England, told CNN the earthquake was caused by a rupture that lasted for “a full minute,” causing sideways movements on the ground.

“Think of a piece of paper tearing, and it tears at about two kilometers per second,” he said.

However, the powerful phenomenon was “not an unexpected event,” Shengji Wei, principal investigator at the Earth Observatory of Singapore said.

Friday's earthquake occurred along a segment of the Sagaing Fault, a major geological fault line that has historically seen big earthquakes, said Wei.

Anxious loved ones waited outside a twisted mass of metal and concrete in the heart of Thailand's capital on Saturday as rescuers searched for dozens of missing workers and the city confronted the aftermath of a rare and powerful earthquake that set skyscrapers swaying and rattled millions of residents.

Friday's 7.7-magnitude quake struck hundreds of miles away in impoverished Myanmar, but was strong enough to send shock waves through the forest of high-rise condominiums, shopping malls and offices of central Bangkok, sending water spilling from infinity pools and buckling carriages on the city's rail network.

In Myanmar some 700 people have been confirmed killed so far and more than 1,600 injured, according to the isolated country's military government, with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimating the final toll there could surpass 10,000 people according to early modeling.

At least 10 people have died in Bangkok, its deputy governor said, sending shock waves of a different kind through a city that sits on no major tectonic fault.

The ground zero of the devastation in the Thai capital is an under-construction 30-story skyscraper next to the sprawling Chatuchak weekend market popular with the millions of foreign tourists that visit the city each year.

Early Saturday the loved ones of those feared buried under the mountain of broken pillars, rubble and steel sat on plastic chairs at the edge of the excavation site, watching diggers claw through the debris.

Junpen Kaewnoi's mother and sister were working as painters on the site and are now among the missing, she told CNN.

“I kept calling, but it was unsuccessful. All I kept hearing was the continuous toot… toot… of a busy signal,” she said.

“I feel like there's a lump in my stomach, and I have no appetite to eat. I'm worried about my mom and sister still being stuck inside since yesterday. Nowhere to be found.”

She said she had spoken to her sister on Friday morning before they left for work.

“I asked her what she would have for lunch,” she recalled.

In a city where deep inequalities are on stark display, many of Bangkok's construction workers hail from poorer parts of Thailand, especially its less wealthy northeast, as well as from neighboring Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar.

The collapsed structure was being built by a subsidiary of the China Railway No. 10 Engineering Group, itself a subsidiary of the state-owned China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), one of the world's largest construction and engineering contractors, according to a now-deleted social media post by the group.

The Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited was also involved in the project, according to Chinese state media report from 2021.

In a post on its official WeChat account on April 2, 2024, China Railway No. 10 Engineering Group celebrated the completion of the building's main structure on March 31, 2024.

When completed, the 137-meter building was to serve as the office of Thailand's State Audit Office and other related government agencies, the company said in the post.

The post, which was seen by CNN, was deleted late Friday afternoon after screenshots of it started to circulate on Chinese social media. CNN has reached out to the company for comment.

Elsewhere across the Southeast Asian megacity, glitzy glass-and-steel buildings home to expensive real estate swayed and groaned when the quake hit, showering dust onto the ground.

A bridge connecting two high-rise apartment buildings in an upmarket neighborhood broke during the quake, video showed.

Other videos showed the contents of rooftop infinity pools – a popular status symbol of Bangkok's well-heeled – sloshing off the sides of towering apartment blocks onto the street below.

Bangkok has expanded at a breakneck pace, with high-rise condos and gleaming skyscrapers shooting up in recent decades.

When the tremors began, Bella Pawita Sunthornpong thought she was experiencing a moment of lightheadedness, “because I was seeing everything was swaying.”

“But I was walking out to another room, and I start seeing the lamp from the ceiling was, like, really swaying together,” she told CNN, describing the moment she realized it was an earthquake.

She grabbed her phone and started running down from the 33rd floor, telling others around her to run too. As she made her way out of the building, she said, ceiling paint was falling and everything was still swaying.

“I was thinking, you know, whatever happened, I just need to keep running until I hit the ground,” Pawita Sunthornpong said.

Engineers were rushing Saturday to assess nearly 1,000 reports of “structural concerns” across the city. Authorities said buildings would be graded – green for safe, yellow for buildings with some damage which are usable with caution, and red indicating severe damage requiring closure.

The worst damage has taken place hundreds of miles away across the border in Myanmar, a nation far less well equipped to deal with such a large disaster.

The quake struck near Myanmar's second most populous city, Mandalay, home to historic temple complexes and palaces.

Reuters video from near Mandalay showed a multi-story building collapsing in on itself as the quake hit, sending around a dozen saffron-robed monks ducking for cover.

The city, home to around 1.5 million people, is normally popular with foreign tourists.

But a civil war has raged across the country since the military took power in 2021, ousting civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and ending a 10-year experiment with democratic rule.

Swathes of the country lie outside the control of the junta and are run by a patchwork of ethnic rebels and militias, making compiling reliable information extremely difficult.

The epicenter was recorded in Sagaing region, which borders Mandalay and has been ravaged by the war, with the junta, pro-military militia and rebel groups battling for control and all running checkpoints, making travel by road or river extremely difficult.

Having largely shut the country off from the world during four years of civil war, Min Aung Hlaing – the leader of Myanmar's military government – issued an “open invitation to any organizations and nations willing to come and help the people in need within our country,” adding the toll was likely to rise.

Several aid agencies said they are mobilizing ground operations.

But the military – which has ruled Myanmar for most of its history since independence from Britain in 1948 – has a long and troubled track record of struggling to respond to major natural disasters, and in the past has granted humanitarian access, only to rescind it later.

McALLEN, Texas (AP) — Drenching rains along the Texas-Mexico border trapped hundreds of people in flooded homes and in cars stranded in high waters, scrambling rescue crews to calls for help that continued Friday even as the downpours let up. At least four people died, including some who drowned.

Officials warned that the devastation from the storms — which set records in parts of Texas' low-lying Rio Grande Valley — was only starting to come into focus. In Mexico, hundreds sought temporary shelter, and videos on social media showed military personnel wading through chest-high waters.

On the U.S. side, officials said at least three people were killed in Hidalgo County, where officials said more than 21 inches (53 centimeters) of rain this week soaked the city of Harlingen. The region is rich with farmland, and Texas' agriculture commissioner said the damage included significant losses to agriculture and livestock.

“The bed is the only thing dry right now, because the sofas are soaked. Everything is soaked,” said Jionni Ochoa, 46, from his home in Palm Valley, near Harlingen. He and his wife were still waiting to be rescued Friday as the water inside reached their knees.

He said water started coming into their house the previous night and began pouring out of the electrical sockets. They turned off the power and tried to save as much as they could.

“Things I stacked up, the rain, the water made it float, and it knocked it down. So everything got messed up, everything got ruined,” Ochoa said.

Hidalgo County officials said in a statement that they did not immediately have more information about the three deaths except that they involved law enforcement efforts. The Mexican state of Tamaulipas reported that an 83-year-old man drowned in Reynosa, which is across the border from McAllen, Texas.

Earlier Friday, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement that the driver of a vehicle suspected of taking part in migrant smuggling tried crossing a flooded roadway in Hidalgo County and plunged into a canal. The agency said the body of one person who drowned was recovered and another was missing. It was not immediately known if those were among the deaths reported by county officials.

In Alamo, a small Texas border city, crews responded to more than 100 water rescues, including people stranded in vehicles and trapped in homes, Fire Department Chief R.C. Flores said. Dozens more rescues were made in nearby Weslaco, which was inundated with about 14 inches (36 centimeters) of rain, according to Mayor Adrian Gonzalez.

“It's a historic rainstorm, and it's affecting all the Valley, not just Weslaco,” Gonzalez said.

Thousands of power outages were reported, and more than 20 school districts and college campuses canceled classes. Valley International Airport in Harlingen was closed Friday, and all flights were canceled.

Between 7 and 12 inches of rain (20 and 31 centimeters) fell in parts of northeastern Mexico, according to Tamaulipas authorities.

Luis Gerardo González de la Fuente, state coordinator of emergencies, said the most affected city was Reynosa but conditions were also dangerous in the border cities of Rio Bravo, Miguel Aleman and part of Matamoros, south of Brownsville, Texas.

Some 640 military personnel were deployed in the area. Authorities said electricity was being restored as water levels dropped but did not clarify how many people were still without this service.

In Texas, Emma Alaniz was resigned to not being able to leave her home in a colonia, which is an unincorporated neighborhood usually located in a rural area of a county with underdeveloped infrastructure. She described her home as being on “an island.”

“For today, I won't be able to go anywhere, because I don't have a big vehicle," she said. "I have a small car, and I won't be able to take it out to the flooded street."

TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — The most important Republican in New Jersey's race for governor this year might well be a part-time resident of Bedminster who burnished his reputation and his brand near the Atlantic City Boardwalk.

“Donald Trump is the X factor in this GOP primary,” said Ben Dworkin, director of the Rowan Institute for Public Policy & Citizenship. “His endorsement right now could make or break, depending on to whom he gives it.”

But in a state that has long leaned Democratic, the president's endorsement in the June 10 primary could complicate things in a general election, where the winner of a six-person Democratic field awaits. 

That may explain why one Republican candidate, state Sen. Jon Bramnick, has criticized Trump over his pardons for those involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, and why two other leading contenders have sought the president's support without much fanfare.

Still, in one of only two states with a race for governor this year — Virginia is the other — the general election will be closely watched for clues about whether blue state voters have been won over or repelled by Trump's leadership. Trump, who built his brand as an Atlantic City casino owner and still owns property in New Jersey, including the Bedminster golf club, narrowed the margin between 2020 and 2024 but still lost the state, and Democrats maintain firm control.

Some Republicans think that's changing.




The GOP field dwindled from five candidates to four this past week when Ed Durr, a former state senator and vocal Trump supporter, dropped out. Durr made national news in 2021 when he shocked state Senate President Steve Sweeney, a Democrat, by winning in their southern New Jersey district. A furniture truck driver new to elected office, Durr said in a statement he was ending his campaign so radio host and fellow Trump supporter Bill Spadea could defeat “never Trumpers” in the race.

Both Spadea and Jack Ciattarelli, the 2021 GOP nominee for governor who lost by roughly three percentage points to term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, have said critical things of Trump in the past, but both have embraced him lately.

Ciattarelli met with the president last week. Chris Russell, his campaign strategist, declined to discuss details of the meeting, but said Ciattarelli welcomes the president's support if he should give it. A message seeking comment was left with Spadea's campaign.

Mario Kranjac, the former two-term mayor of the suburban New York City town of Englewood Cliffs and a recent entrant into the race, said he thinks he is the most Trump-aligned candidate because he never wavered in his support for Trump during the president's first term.

“The residents and citizens and taxpayers of New Jersey need a governor with fixed values and beliefs, and that's me -- in terms of everything that I stand for and that President Trump stands for,” he said in a phone interview. “They shouldn't have to worry that when something happens, their candidate is going to abandon President Trump, which I would never do.”

Part of the challenge for Republicans is that the value of Trump's support is a moving target. The first two months of his second term as president may have alienated some voters but won others over. Anticipating how much value Trump could add to the campaign when voters cast their primary ballots is guesswork, with circumstances changing by the day. 

In the pre-Trump era, some Republicans successfully navigated the shoals between the primary and the general elections. While Republicans have not won a U.S. Senate seat in New Jersey in more than five decades, they have enjoyed more success in governor's races. The last three Republicans elected governor — Thomas Kean Sr., Christine Todd Whitman and Chris Christie — all won two consecutive terms. But their brand of politics included business-friendly conservatism, hardly the same as Trump's aggressive populism.

Democrats remain the dominant party in the state, but some Republicans say that hold is slipping. Russell, Ciattarelli's strategist, points to the registration gains the GOP has made, shaving the Democrats' advantage from 1 million more voters to 834,000 more. 

He said Democrats should not be overconfident in their traditional advantages.

“I think they're missing the lesson of the 2024 election in New Jersey, which is Donald Trump did exceedingly well in New Jersey,” he said.

The weight of Trump's influence lingers as one of the lessons the GOP took from 2024. That much seemed evident in Durr's withdrawal from the race.

In his statement announcing the decision, Durr said he was ending his campaign so Spadea could prevail. Soon after, Durr said his statement was not actually an endorsement. Steve Kush, a Durr spokesperson, explained the distinction and, in the process, reflected who the big dog is in the primary.

“He doesn't want to use the word endorse because he doesn't want to get ahead of President Trump,” Kush said.

Kansas health officials have confirmed 23 measles cases, marking an outbreak for the state as infections in at least 17 states have led to the most cases in the U.S. in a single year since 2019. 

The Kansas outbreak is spread across 6 southwest counties, the state's Department of Health and Environment said Wednesday. 

The majority of cases, 20, are individuals who were not vaccinated against the infection. Fifteen cases are in school-aged children, between ages 5 and 17, six patients are 4 years old or younger and two are over 18, officials said. 

Health officials in Ohio have also reported 10 cases this week.

"Given the measles activity in Texas, New Mexico, and other states around the country, we're disappointed but not surprised we now have several cases here in Ohio and known exposure in some counties," Ohio Department of Health Director Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff said in a news release Tuesday.

Measles, a highly contagious infectious disease, can in some cases cause severe infections in the lungs and brain that may lead to cognitive issues, deafness or death. A vaccine against the illness is safe and effective, doctors and health officials say.

While most people's symptoms improve, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized. About 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected will die, the CDC says. 

So far, no cases in Kansas have led to hospitalization or death, according to the data from the state's health department. 

The Kansas cases come as other states are facing rising infections too. The majority of the cases have been reported in an outbreak in Texas that has sickened more than 400 people since late January and has caused the death of a child. An adult with measles also died in New Mexico.

Earlier this month, a person with a confirmed measles infection may have exposed Amtrak passengers on a train to Washington, D.C., according to officials at the D.C. Department of Health. 

Measles cases have also been reported in a number of other states, including New Jersey, Georgia, California, Rhode Island, Kentucky, Michigan, Alaska and Pennsylvania. 

The measles vaccine is usually administered in childhood as part of the measles-mumps-rubella, or MMR, shot. Two doses are about 97% effective at preventing measles, and a single dose is about 93% effective, the CDC says. 

Similar to the Kansas cases, the Texas outbreak largely spread in a community with very low vaccination rates, and Texas health officials said the child who died in that outbreak was unvaccinated.

AUTO TARIFFS: President Trump told CEOs of some of the country's top automakers during a call earlier this month that the White House would look unfavorably on car prices being raised as a result of tariffs, leaving some of them rattled and worried they would face punishment if they increased prices, Josh Dawsey and Ryan Felton of Wall Street Journal report, citing people with knowledge of the call. Trump told the CEOs they should be grateful for his elimination of what he called former President Joe Biden's electric-vehicle mandate, according to the Journal. He made a pitch for how they would actually benefit from tariffs, two people on the call told the paper. Publicly traded companies in the space include Ford (F), General Motors (GM), Honda (HMC), Mercedes-Benz (MBGYY), Nissan (NSANY), Stellantis (STLA), Tesla (TSLA), Toyota (TM) and Volkswagen (VWAGY).

PURE CHAOS: After speaking to auto industry experts from the U.S., Europe, and Asia, Wedbush concluded President Trump's 25% tariff on all cars and parts made outside the U.S. “would send the auto industry into pure chaos.” The move will raise the average price of cars between $5,000 on the low end and $10,000-$15,000 on the high end, the firm tells investors in a research note. Wedbush believes every auto maker in the world will have to raise prices selling into the U.S. while the supply chain logistics of the tariff announcement is “hard to even put our arms around at this moment.” A U.S. car with all U.S. parts made in the U.S. “is a fictional tale not even possible today,” according to the firm.

Wedbush thinks it would take three years to move 10% of the auto supply chain to the U.S. and cost hundreds of billions “with much complexity and disruption.” It adds, “The concept of this auto tariff in our view would be a back breaker and Armageddon for the auto industry globally and throws the supply chain into pure panic mode.” Wedbush believes the winner from these tariffs “is no one.” Even Tesla will be hit and will be forced to raise prices, the firm predicts. The news will continue to put “major pressure” on General Motors and other auto makers and suppliers until more clarity is learned from the White House, Wedbush says.

POSITIVE FOR AUTO PARTS: Mizuho believes President Trump's 25% tariff announcement on new vehicles made outside the U.S. “represents another positive” for the domestic aftermarket auto parts operators. The tariffs should facilitate an older cohort of cars on the road and, therefore, the need for ongoing repairs, the firm tells investors in a research note. Mizuho believes AutoZone (AZO) and its top pick O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) “remain growthy safe havens amid a still uncertain spending backdrop and fears around demand destruction from reciprocal tariffs.” Channel checks indicate foot traffic data has picked up for both companies over the last few weeks, the firm adds. Mizuho also sees “developing positives” for CarMax (KMX) given the likelihood higher prices for new vehicles will ultimately lead to a shift towards the relative value of used car transactions. This will also benefit Valvoline (VVV) as new dealers can own the oil change relationship for the first several years post a new vehicle purchase, according to the firm.

CONCESSIONS: European Union officials are identifying concessions the bloc is willing to make to Donald Trump's administration to secure the partial removal of the U.S. tariffs that have already started hitting exports and are set to increase after April 2, according to Bloomberg. EU representatives were told at meetings this week in Washington that there was no way to avoid new auto and so-called reciprocal tariffs that Trump is launching next week, people familiar with the talks told Bloomberg‘s Alberto Nardelli and Shawn Donnan, but discussions also began on what the contours of a potential deal to reduce them should eventually look like.

LICENSE: The Trump administration, which has already expressed its desire to retake the Panama Canal and assume control of Greenland, is being nudged by the Metals Company (TMC) to disregard the The International Seabed Authority and grant the company a license to start mining in international waters as soon as 2027, reported The New York Times. Gerard Barron, the CEO at the Metals Company, “announced the maneuver Thursday after it became clear that it could still be years before the Seabed Authority finalizes mining regulations,” the Times noted. Barron said executives had already met with Trump administration officials to promote their plan, which would also require a permit from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Times added.

Oops, something went wrong

Elon Musk's attempt to remake the Social Security system appears to be deeply informed by his time at a company that helped him become a leading figure in Silicon Valley: PayPal (PYPL).

His tenure at the digital payments upstart more than two decades ago was marked by a fight against fraud, which he and his then-colleagues considered an existential threat to their enterprise.

"Fraud wasn't just a storyline at early PayPal — it was the storyline," said Jimmy Soni, an author of a book about the company that turned into a tech star in the late 1990s and early 2000s. "It represented survival or catastrophe."

How Musk and his PayPal cohort tried to deal with financial cheating in that era has clear echoes today as Musk's DOGE team has embarked on a search for fraud across the federal government and in the Social Security system in particular.

While available data shows that fraud is a much smaller relative issue in the federal government now than at early PayPal — where losses indisputably represented a sizable piece of the startup's balance sheet — Musk rarely offers commentary these days that doesn't make charges of widespread wrongdoing around the government.

"This is happening all day, every day," he said just this past week during a Fox News appearance, adding, "It's because of all the fraud loopholes in the Social Security system."

In that interview with Musk and his DOGE colleagues, fraud came up 28 times, according to a search of the transcript, with Musk adding his view that if the issue is not addressed "we're going to go bankrupt."

Similarly, when Musk talked about his time at PayPal for Soni's 2022 history of the company, he recalled thinking that "if the fraud thing is not solved, we're going to die."

Musk's PayPal history began in 1999 when he co-founded a company called X.com that had a mission of becoming an online bank for an early internet adopter audience.

X.com later merged with a competitor that called its payments application PayPal. Musk briefly led the combined entity but was pushed out shortly afterward, with the company eventually renaming itself PayPal.

The connections between PayPal and Social Security may be tenuous — both in their history and documented levels of fraud — but it's a connection many Trump allies have eagerly embraced.

Social Security began in 1935 and is a weekly part of life for millions of citizens; in 2025, the agency sent out about $1.6 trillion in benefits to around 69 million Americans.

A hearing this week for Trump's pick to lead Social Security was notable for repeated descriptions of Social Security as — in the words of one senator — "a payment system at its core."

Nominee Frank Bisignano called the agency he aims to lead "fundamentally ... a payment-based customer-facing program" in language that could also describe PayPal.

The PayPal connection is one that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, a close Musk ally, has drawn most sharply.

In recent comments on the podcast "All-In", the Commerce secretary floated the idea of cutting off Social Security payments as a potentially good means to find fraud because he feels that most Americans, unlike fraudsters, "wouldn't call and complain."

"All the guys who did PayPal, like Elon, knows this by heart," Lutnick added. "Anybody who's been in the payment system and the process system knows the easiest way to find the fraudster is to stop payments and listen."

Soni said that his work suggests a different lesson from PayPal's fights against fraud — more about the value of exploiting the evidence that fraudsters leave.

"PayPal's brilliance was in building sophisticated detection systems that could identify those suspicious patterns while minimizing disruption to legitimate users," Soni added, saying PayPal succeeded by "finding that sweet-spot balance between fraud prevention and user friction."

Indeed, PayPal's work to combat fraud was ahead of its time. The company pioneered things like challenge-response tests to tell computers and humans apart (known as CAPTCHAs) and other methods, like random deposit verification for bank accounts, still in use today.

Musk has also used his time at PayPal as a bona fide for his current access to highly sensitive government data. In February, he posted that if he wanted to sift through personal data, "I could have done that at PAYPAL. Hello???"

Lutnick's idea of cutting off payments is not something that Musk himself appears to have embraced, and he has also talked about applying technical solutions to many of the government's fraud problems.

Musk — who likes to brand his DOGE effort as "tech support" — often says technical solutions like closing fraud loopholes and creating better-connected computer systems will take care of many problems.

But Musk has also often repeated claims of widespread stealing at the agency, charges President Trump also regularly echoes.

Musk has said Social Security may represent "the biggest fraud in history" and added in a Fox Business appearance that waste and fraud in entitlement spending is "the big one to eliminate."

By contrast, the Social Security Administration's internal inspector general has studied fraud at the agency and recently released an audit of improper payments that found a much more limited picture.

It found fraudulent payments amounted to about 0.84% of total benefits paid from 2015 to 2022, which nonetheless totaled nearly $72 billion in that span, given the large financial footprint of the agency.

Bisignano embraced the inspector general's findings during his recent hearing — subtly downplaying Musk and Trump's claims of bigger fraud — and repeatedly said that even the 1% level of fraud is much too high.

Bisignano, who has called himself "fundamentally a DOGE person," also said during the hearing he was open to working with Musk's team but that he would be willing to reverse decisions made by them.

Musk's time at PayPal also appears to have been a precursor to Musk's disdain for government inefficiency.

In his history, Soni recounts an episode where PayPal discovered a fraudster operating just miles from their headquarters.

"We got all the evidence necessary," Musk told the author, adding for emphasis: "Crime in progress!" But Musk also remembered that it took "forever" for authorities to act on what he recalled as an open-and-shut case.

"This wasn't just parallel frustration with fraud and government — these frustrations were fused," Soni noted this past week.

Soni said that the experience led many of PayPal's leaders to "develop a particular institutional skepticism now embedded in tech culture: a wariness of processes that value procedural consistency over rapid adaptation."

The alumni of the company — now often referred to as the "PayPal Mafia" — include multiple prominent figures in Trump's orbit, such as White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks and venture capitalist Peter Thiel, who was the CEO of PayPal until its sale to eBay (EBAY) in 2002.

Indeed, this frustration with government — and suspicion of fraud — has become a driver for Musk throughout his career.

As Musk put it in a 2013 tweet, he says he got rich during this early stage of his career, which included PayPal, and he did it with "zero govt anything."

Oops, something went wrong

More than 9 million Americans could see “substantial declines” in their FICO scores in the coming months as delinquent student loans begin showing up on credit reports for the first time since the pandemic, according to a new analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

The report finds that over 15% of all student loan holders are likely now behind on debts, slightly more than before the pandemic. Those affected could face a tougher time getting access to home or auto loans or see their credit card limits lowered.

Borrowers have been required to make normal monthly payments on their student loans for well over a year, since the Biden administration ended the COVID-era pause on the program. But they temporarily benefited from a so-called “onboarding” phase, during which loan servicers were not allowed to report late or missed payments to credit agencies.

That grace period ended in September. Since servicers cannot report a loan as delinquent until it is 90 days past due, late student loan payments are only just now showing up on Americans' credit scores.

For those who are behind, the impact on their creditworthiness could be significant. In its report, the New York Fed's researchers found that a student loan delinquency can knock more than 150 points from the FICO score of someone with around average credit. For subprime borrowers — those with scores below 660 — it can subtract 87 points.

The Biden administration took several steps aimed at helping student borrowers get current on their loans as repayment resumed. Those included the Fresh Start program, which allowed people who had defaulted on their debts to get current without facing penalties. But only about 900,000 individuals took advantage of the offer, according to the Department of Education, leaving millions more lingering in default.

Recent confusion around the state of the student loan program may not be helping matters. For the past month, for instance, the administration had blocked access to income-driven repayment plans, which cap what borrowers owe each month at a percentage of their earnings, in response to a court ruling, leaving many with fewer options to manage their debts. Those applications finally reopened on Wednesday.

The Trump administration is also widely expected to restart involuntary collections on defaulted student loans sometime this year, though it's unclear if they have a plan worked out for resuming that process, which can involve garnishing paychecks and government benefits like Social Security payments. The administration's recent announcement that the student loan program would be moved out of the Department of Education to the Small Business Administration has made things additionally murky.

The New York Fed has traditionally tracked the number of delinquent student loans based on credit bureau data. But that was effectively made impossible during the pandemic payment pause and onboarding period, since late payments were no longer being reported to the agencies. For its new estimate, it combined information on delinquencies on loans not owned by the government as well as the Department of Education's own data on its student debt portfolio. The credit modeling company VantageScore similarly estimated that there are about 9 million delinquent loans outstanding.

Oops, something went wrong

Millennials' wealth has been booming. According to Federal Reserve data, millennials' total net worth has nearly quadrupled since 2019, increasing from $4.54 trillion in 2019 to $16.26 trillion in 2024.

This increase in wealth is particularly notable for millennial investors. A Wealthfront study found that for their millennial investing clients, the proportion of millionaires increased by 144% over the past five years. This is a much larger increase than other generations experienced — the proportion of Gen X millionaires only increased by 31% over the same time period, and it decreased among baby boomers.

Here are the strategies millennial investors have been using to become millionaires.

The key factor driving millennials' financial success is their approach to investing.

“When comparing asset allocations across generations, data shows that millennials are holding a larger portion of their wealth in equities than older generations were at the same age,” said David Fortunato, CEO of Wealthfront. “By taking advantage of investments that offer higher risk adjusted returns, millennials have been able to accumulate wealth faster than previous generations.”

Millennials are also saving more aggressively than prior generations.

“Data shows that their savings rate is significantly higher when compared with the savings rate of older generations,” Fortunato said. “This is a trend we expect to continue as millennials advance in their careers and continue building wealth.”

Millennials' housing wealth grew by $2.5 trillion between 2020 and 2024, The Wall Street Journal reported.

“Housing is the biggest item in most budgets, and whether those funds are used to buy or rent a home can have a large impact on long-term financial outcomes,” Fortunato said. “While renting is typically less costly on a monthly basis, buying a home offers a number of financial benefits that can help millennials reach their financial goals.

“Crucially, mortgage payments contribute to owning a long-term asset that has historically increased over time,” he continued. “Recent increases in home values have already benefited millennials in just the past few years.”

Among Wealthfront's millennial clients, the average home value increased by more than 40% between March 2020 and February 2025.

“Data also shows that real estate wealth is expected to keep increasing as millennials age, making it a smart addition to a long-term wealth building strategy,” Fortunato said.

Since March 2020, the average millennial Wealthfront client's IRA balance has grown by more than 110%; Gen X's average IRA balance only grew by 52% over that time period.

“Retirement outcomes are greatly impacted by three key factors: asset allocation, tax optimization and fees,” Fortunato said. “IRAs are one of the most powerful tools to save for retirement because they are designed to address each of those factors — IRAs offer significant tax advantages, and when compared with 401(k) plans, IRAs typically have lower fees and offer more investment options.

“Millennials are about two decades away from retirement, which means this generation still has many years for the benefits of investing in an IRA to compound over time.”

Saving in IRAs is just one aspect of many millennials' retirement planning strategy. Overall, the generation's investors are on track to have long-term financial success.

“As millennials age, data shows that millennials' retirement assets are expected to become the biggest contributor to their overall wealth when also including 401(k) assets,” Fortunato said. “In just the last five years, our millennial clients have increased their IRA assets by 110% on average, driven by consistent investments in Wealthfront's diversified portfolios. By taking advantage of smart investment strategies, millennials are putting themselves in a strong position to be well-prepared for retirement.”

Oops, something went wrong

Last November, Hudson Bay Capital released a 41-page document that outlined a plan to restructure the global trading system with a juicy premise for Wall Street.

Complicated and dense, "A User's Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System" touches on everything from US debt to interest rates to re-shoring of US manufacturing but with a central idea of a "Mar-a-Lago accord" built around tackling dollar "overvaluation" and what author Stephen Miran wrote could be "a 21st Century version of a multilateral currency agreement."

"Many argue that tariffs are highly inflationary," he wrote at another point, but "that not need be the case," especially if currency issues are also addressed.

The idea quickly gained steam on Wall Street, with prominent backers on Wall Street like Jim Bianco of Bianco Research urging investors to read it. Bianco said in February it was a signal that the young administration is "thinking very big," as he put it on a podcast called MacroVoices.

The thesis was also bolstered by Miran's subsequent selection to head Trump's Council of Economic Advisers, a sort of in-house think tank at the White House.

The issue, at least so far? That fuller plan outlined in the paper has been belied by the administration's own actions since taking office.

President Trump is clearly aiming to upend the global trading system and is full speed ahead on one side of Miran's thesis — the implementation of tariffs — but has put the corollary currency piece on ice and even offered some skeptical comments since taking office.

Miran himself acknowledged as much in a series of recent comments.

He told the Washington Post recently, "Anyone thinking what I wrote in November is the policy agenda we're secretly implementing right now is just looking for something to write about."

He added to Bloomberg of his ideas that "some of them are easy, some are tough," and downplayed the importance of his paper, saying instead that Trump is "solely" focused on tariffs right now.

Yet the paper has remained a source of positivity, even as Bianco said from the get-go it could never happen. Miran even wrote about tariffs being a first priority before policy "becomes dollar negative."

It was cited often by those needing a silver lining amid the current uncertainty of market volatility, sticky inflation, and nervousness about the possibility of a recession as Trump touts his coming April 2 "Liberation Day" plans.

Columbia University historian Adam Tooze went so far in a recent Substack post as to compare the continued market focus on Miran's paper with Stockholm Syndrome, the psychological phenomenon where a hostage develops positive feelings toward their captor.

"Call it Mar-a-Lago (Accord) Syndrome," Tooze wrote.

Miran in his paper argued that tackling the currency question could rebound in America's favor on a variety of fronts — from the national debt to national security arrangements to providing a boost to US businesses.

The goal is to ensure the dollar remains supreme as a global reserve currency while at same time correcting what he viewed as an "overvalued dollar" that makes US manufacturing less competitive.

The US, he argued, could convince other countries to help with that devaluation in exchange for security guarantees or a pledge to drop punitive tariffs — what he called the "multilateral" approach to a new trading landscape but one that it's very unclear other countries would go along with willingly.

He also wrote in detail about how the administration could, if needed, unilaterally act "if it is willing to be creative" to address the problem of undervalued foreign currencies — pointing to possible measures in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA).

But it's a detail that has perhaps unwittingly underlined Trump's focus elsewhere so far in his second presidency.

The president has indeed relied on IEEPA law for dramatic actions in his early weeks in office — but almost solely the tariff provisions in the law, to impose tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, without significant action on currency.

And in another recent appearance, on CNBC, Miran didn't weigh in on currency at all and even sounded firmly in line with Trump's overall message of downplaying any economic effects from tariffs.

"My view is that the country on which we are imposing those tariffs ultimately pays those tariffs as opposed to having any negative economic consequence on the United States," he offered.

Trump likes to promise to keep aloft "the mighty U.S. Dollar" and maintain its status as the global reserve currency.

But in other settings, Trump has suggested an openness to a devaluation case and acknowledged in a campaign interview that the gap between the US and other currencies has created a "tremendous burden" on companies.

In any case, a meaningful push for currency measures or devaluation hasn't emerged from the White House so far even as Wall Street interest has remained high.

In his recent comments to Bloomberg, Miran seemed amused that he was still being asked about the paper as he downplayed its chances in the near term.

It's "taken on a life of its own, against all my intents," he quipped.

But hope perhaps springs eternal, with Miran adding of the currency side of the equation, "Could it be something that is entertained down the road? Sure."

A recent study exposing AI models to carefully designed prompts around trauma revealed they can get anxious, potentially affecting the conversation and having negative impacts on people who use such models to discuss their mental health.

Artificial intelligence (AI) models are sensitive to the emotional context of conversations humans have with them — they even can suffer "anxiety" episodes, a new study has shown.

While we consider (and worry about) people and their mental health, a new study published March 3 in the journal Nature shows that delivering particular prompts to large language models (LLMs) may change their behavior and elevate a quality we would ordinarily recognize in humans as "anxiety."

This elevated state then has a knock-on impact on any further responses from the AI, including a tendency to amplify any ingrained biases.

The study revealed how "traumatic narratives," including conversations around accidents, military action or violence, fed to ChatGPT increased its discernible anxiety levels, leading to an idea that being aware of and managing an AI's "emotional" state can ensure better and healthier interactions.

The study also tested whether mindfulness-based exercises — the type advised to people — can mitigate or lessen chatbot anxiety, remarkably finding that these exercises worked to reduce the perceived elevated stress levels.

The researchers used a questionnaire designed for human psychology patients called the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-s) — subjectingOpen AI's GPT-4 to the test under three different conditions.

First was the baseline, where no additional prompts were made and ChatGPT's responses were used as study controls. Second was an anxiety-inducing condition, where GPT-4 was exposed to traumatic narratives before taking the test.

The third condition was a state of anxiety induction and subsequent relaxation, where the chatbot received one of the traumatic narratives followed by mindfulness or relaxation exercises like body awareness or calming imagery prior to completing the test.

The study used five traumatic narratives and five mindfulness exercises, randomizing the order of the narratives to control for biases. It repeated the tests to make sure the results were consistent, and scored the STAI-s responses on a sliding scale, with higher values indicating increased anxiety.

The scientists found that traumatic narratives increased anxiety in the test scores significantly, and mindfulness prompts prior to the test reduced it, demonstrating that the "emotional" state of an AI model can be influenced through structured interactions.

The study's authors said their work has important implications for human interaction with AI, especially when the discussion centers on our own mental health. They said their findings proved prompts to AI can generate what's called a "state-dependent bias," essentially meaning a stressed AI will introduce inconsistent or biased advice into the conversation, affecting how reliable it is.

—Most ChatGPT users think AI models have 'conscious experiences'

—China's Manus AI 'agent' could be our 1st glimpse at artificial general intelligence

Although the mindfulness exercises didn't reduce the stress level in the model to the baseline, they show promise in the field of prompt engineering. This can be used to stabilize the AI's responses, ensuring more ethical and responsible interactions and reducing the risk the conversation will cause distress to human users in vulnerable states.

But there's a potential downside — prompt engineering raises its own ethical concerns. How transparent should an AI be about being exposed to prior conditioning to stabilize its emotional state? In one hypothetical example the scientists discussed, if an AI model appears calm despite being exposed to distressing prompts, users might develop false trust in its ability to provide sound emotional support.

The study ultimately highlighted the need for AI developers to design emotionally aware models that minimize harmful biases while maintaining predictability and ethical transparency in human-AI interactions.

Female Asian hermit spiders gobble up their partners after mating, so males detach their penises and sometimes offer up an amputated leg to escape.

Name: Asian hermit spider (Nephilengys malabarensis)

Where it lives: South, Southeast and East Asia (including India, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, China, Japan and Indonesia)

What it eats: Moths, beetles, flies, crickets and other small insects

Why it's awesome: The Asian hermit spider is no ordinary arachnid. This spider has evolved an adaptation that allows it to reproduce while escaping the threat of female cannibalism: It can detach its penis.

This spider species displays extreme sexual dimorphism, meaning that males and females have significantly different appearances. Females can grow up to around 0.59 inches (15 millimeters), while males are less than 0.20 inches (5 millimeters).

Males face considerable risks during mating due to aggression from females, which may kill and eat their partners before or after mating. Sex can be so treacherous for the males that they have developed the ability to detach their penis so they can leave it pumping sperm while they flee to safety.

In this process of "remote copulation," a male spider's palp — its sperm-delivering organ, of which it has two — can break off inside the female's reproductive tract. The broken-off palp can remain inside the female and continue pumping sperm into her even after the male has escaped.

While studying this "eunuch phenomenon" among orb-web spiders, biologists discovered that the longer the severed palp is left in the female genitals, the more sperm it transfers. And palp breakage induced by the female, instead of the male, led to faster sperm transfer.

The detachable penis also serves another important function: It acts as a mating plug. After breaking off, the embolus — a needle-like structure that delivers the sperm — stays lodged inside the female's reproductive opening to prevent other males from mating with her. This reduces sperm competition and increases the likelihood that the male's genes will be passed on.

After losing its penis, the male spider also becomes more aggressive and guards the female from other males that might try to dislodge the "palp plug" and inseminate the female.

According to a 2011 study in the journal Animal Behaviour, removing one palp reduces the spider's body weight and increases its endurance, thereby boosting its ability to fight. This finding supports what the researchers called a "gloves-off" mating strategy, where the spiders have nothing to live for other than protecting their potential offspring.

The male spiders also have another trick to prevent being eaten by the females: Sometimes, they offer one of their legs to the female as a distraction during mating. This act of self-amputation, known as autotomy, reduces the risk of being attacked or eaten during the mating process. It can also buy the male time to escape.

Museum experts are exploring how to bring the science dioramas of yore into the 21st century, while ensuring scientific accuracy and acknowledging past biases, freelance writer Amber Dance reported in “The diorama dilemma.”

Reader Gary Hoyle reminisced about his time working as an exhibits artist and curator of natural history at the Maine State Museum. Hoyle recounted working with esteemed diorama painter Fred Scherer and learning about another renowned diorama artist, James Perry Wilson.

“Wilson was a trained architect draftsman who had worked to develop a grid pattern that minimized the distortion of viewing a curved background against the three-dimensional foreground of dioramas. His and Fred's sensitivity to light and the colors of nature astound me still,” Hoyle wrote. “When painting backgrounds, they consciously modified colors to reduce the green tint from the plate glass in the viewing window.”

Hoyle noted that the many scientific and artistic challenges that went into developing wildlife dioramas are now being ignored or lost to history. “What is needed is a museum devoted solely to … these complicated, mesmerizing exhibits.”

A Pacific submarine volcano called Axial Seamount is likely to erupt in 2025, freelance writer Rachel Berkowitz reported in “An undersea volcano may soon erupt near Oregon.”

Reader Ginger Johnson asked if the eruption could cause a tsunami.

Axial's eruptions are benign to us humans, says geophysicist William Chadwick of Oregon State University's Hatfield Marine Science Center. “The volcano is too deep, [about 1,500 meters underwater], and the kind of activity anticipated is too mild” to trigger a tsunami, he says.

What's more, tsunamis are typically caused by sudden, large movements of the seafloor, especially around subduction zones, where one tectonic plate slides beneath another. “An eruption at Axial Seamount would have no effect on the Cascadia subduction zone along the coast of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia” because the volcano is too far away, Chadwick says.

The math puzzle “Imagine there's no zero” challenges readers to use mathematician James Foster's number system, which uses T to avoid a zero symbol.

Reader Bill Torcaso found the number system valid but bizarre. “What about arithmetic operations?” he wrote. “ ‘Nothing' is still important.”

In general, arithmetic operations can be accommodated without a zero symbol, says puzzle maker Ben Orlin. “Negatives, for example, still work fine. Decimals are trickier but can be handled with an adapted version of scientific notation, using negative powers of T.” For instance, the decimal 0.03, which is 3 x 10−2 in scientific notation, would become 3 x T−2.

But ‘nothing' is still important. “Foster has eliminated zero as a placeholder, but not as a number concept,” Orlin says. “We can eradicate the zeros from every number in existence, with one very notable exception: zero itself.”

Due to an editing error, February's math puzzle incorrectly equated 2T with two boxed-up tens. Indeed, 2T equals 30.

Why do some crowds move in an orderly fashion while others devolve into a chaotic jumble? New research led by an MIT mathematician may finally crack the tricky crowd problem.

Navigating a busy crowd is often an awkward experience, but sometimes, it feels much easier than others. In a crowded hallway, people seem to spontaneously organize themselves into lanes, while in an open city square, people travel in every direction, darting from one side to the other.

But what determines the way people move in busy spaces?

Karol Bacik, a mathematician at MIT, and colleagues have developed a mathematical theory that accurately predicts pedestrian flow and the point where it changes from organized lanes to an entangled crowd. The work, which they reported in the journal PNAS March 24, could help architects and city planners design safer and more efficient public spaces that promote ordered crowds.

The team started by creating a mathematical simulation of a moving crowd in different spaces, using fluid dynamics equations to analyze the motion of pedestrians across various scenarios.

"If you think about the whole crowd flowing, rather than individuals, you can use fluid-like descriptions," Bacik said in a statement. "If you only care about the global characteristics like, are there lanes or not, then you can make predictions without detailed knowledge of everyone in the crowd."

Both the width of the space and the angles at which people moved across it heavily influenced the overall order of the crowd. Bacik's team identified "angular spread" — the number of people walking in different directions — as the key factor in whether people self-organized into lanes.

Where the spread of people walking in different directions is relatively small — such as in a narrow corridor or on pavement — pedestrians tend to form lanes and meet oncoming traffic head-on. However, a broader range of individual travel directions — for example, in an open square or airport concourse — dramatically increases the likelihood of disorder as pedestrians dodge and weave around one another to reach their separate destinations.

The tipping point, according to this theoretical analysis, was an angular spread of around 13 degrees, meaning ordered lanes could descend into disordered flow once pedestrians start traveling at more extreme angles.

"This is all very common sense," Bacik said. "[But] now we have a way to quantify when to expect lanes — this spontaneous, organized, safe flow — versus disordered, less efficient, potentially more dangerous flow."

However, the researchers were keen to investigate whether the reality of a human crowd bears out this theory, so they devised an experiment to simulate a busy road crossing. Volunteers, each wearing a paper hat labeled with a unique barcode, were assigned various start and end positions and were asked to walk between opposite sides of a gymnasium without bumping into other participants. An overhead camera recorded each scenario, tracking both the movement of individual pedestrians and the overall motion of the crowd.

Subsequent analysis of the 45 trials confirmed the importance of angular spread, showing a transition from ordered lanes to disordered movement at angles close to the theoretically predicted 13 degrees. Furthermore, as disorder increased, pedestrians were forced to move more slowly to avoid collisions, with a roughly 30% speed reduction for random crowds versus ordered lanes, the team found.

Bacik's team is now looking to test these predictions in real-world scenarios, and they hope the work will ultimately help improve crowded environments.

"We would like to analyze footage and compare that with our theory," he said. "We can imagine that, for anyone designing a public space, if they want to have a safe and efficient pedestrian flow, our work could provide a simpler guideline, or some rules of thumb."

Launched in 2013, the harris project is a nonprofit dedicated to the prevention and treatment of co-occurring disorders (COD) — the combination of mental health challenges and substance use issues. Us Weekly has partnered with the harris project to bring you The Missing Issue, a special edition focusing on the stories of celebrities who struggled with COD. Here, we're revisiting our past coverage of some of those stars.

This story ran on usmagazine.com on September 10, 2013:

[Read the full original story.]

Throughout his 16-year career, ten-time world title winner Oscar De La Hoya was a fearsome competitor in the ring. But the boxer known as “The Golden Boy” said in a 2011 interview with Univision that the one-two punch of addiction and depression was “the biggest fight of [his] life,” one that left him contemplating suicide. De La Hoya, now 52, continues to speak openly about how managing his co-occurring disorders has been a lifelong battle.



De La Hoya has told numerous outlets that his introduction to alcohol was born of curiosity and opportunity — he'd sneak sips of beer at family functions as a child — but that introduction soon became a problem. He developed a dependency partly as a result of what he says was a physically and emotionally abusive relationship with his parents. “I got into a lot of alcohol and drugs, and I just literally lost myself,” he told Fox Business in July 2023. He was seeking affection he didn't get, he says. “My father never told me, ‘I love you,'” he told BELLA magazine that same month. “My mother never told me she loved me … When I would cry, she would start hitting me. That is how bad it was.”

De La Hoya's professional persona centered on his toughness and imperviousness to pain, but behind the scenes he was self-medicating to block out overwhelming fear and shame. “I depended more on the alcohol than the cocaine,” De La Hoya told Univision in 2011. “It took me to a place where I felt safe; it took me to a place where I felt as if nobody [could] say anything to me; it took me to a place where I just [could] reach out and grab my mom.”

A father of six, De La Hoya has said that he wasn't prepared to be a parent — and that his older children suffered as a result of his emotional absence. “It comes to the point where you convince yourself that this is not you,” he told BELLA magazine. “This is scary. You are not worthy of this. You are not worthy of giving love. Then you start feeling sorry for yourself. Life starts just spiraling and you're lost. All you want to do is drink and do drugs and escape … I always felt like I wasn't worthy of anything, like I wasn't worthy of love, and I wasn't worthy enough to do the job.”

The former athlete shares his eldest child, son Jacob, 27, with ex Toni Alvarado. He also shares his son Devon, 26, and daughter Atiana, 25, with exes Angelicque McQueen and Shanna Moakler, respectively. He and his ex-wife, Millie Corretjer, welcomed kids Oscar Jr., 19, Nina, 17, and Victoria, 11, before their 2016 split.

“I did go through the rehabs, I did go through therapies,” he told the Associated Press in July 2023. “At this time in my life, I've made the decision and I've prepared myself over the years to find balance. It's all balance. Life is great. It's really, really good right now. I'm happy, I'm working, I'm doing the things I want to do on my terms … It's like I'm doing it my way for the first time ever.”

The Conners star Emma Kenney feels lucky to have boyfriend Conrad Hilton by her side.

During an exclusive interview with Us Weekly, Kenney, 27, opened up about working on her foster-based rescue Yogi's House with Hilton, 30, saying, “My boyfriend and I have always been huge animal lovers. That's something we bonded over years ago when we first started dating. When I started Yogi's House, he definitely wanted to get involved and I'm so grateful for his help.”

Kenney praised Hilton for his hard work. “He is extremely hands-on and he also just listens to me on the phone with veterinarians literally all day, every day. He never gets annoyed about it and he's always there to offer his advice,” she shared. “So it's definitely really special to be able to do it with him.”

In addition to collaborating with Hilton, Kenney founded Yogi's House with fellow actress Nicola Peltz-Beckham. “We both are super passionate about dog rescue, which is kind of how we bonded initially and how Yogi's House came to be,” she added. “It's something I'm so grateful for doing with a partner and it's definitely a dream come true.”



Kenney got her start as a child actress in projects such as Shameless, The Conners and more. She has used her platform to transition to philanthropic work as well.

“That is how I spend probably half of my day at least working on it,” Kenney told Us. “I honestly feel like I'm getting a veterinary degree at this point because I deal with the foster vets every single day. I honestly feel I'm learning a lot about the medical side of raising dogs, which is really interesting and something that I would be interested in learning more about.”

She added: “Every single day something new comes up. It's a lot of people. I deal with a lot of people every single day and we create these relationships and we have such an amazing foster community and we really couldn't do the rescue without our fosters since we're foster-based. So I'm so grateful for every single volunteer that we've worked with. We could not do it without everyone.”

Kenney took great pride in the professional venture, saying, “Ever since I've been a kid, I've always been super passionate about animal rescue and I always knew owning a dog rescue was going to be something I did one day. So to actually have it come to fruition and be something I'm doing every single day is such a dream come true.”

When Kenney isn't helping rescue dogs in Los Angeles, she is working in front of the camera. Kenney's hit ABC series The Conners is currently airing its final season and she's already thinking about what comes next.

“I've been working so consistently since I was 9 and this is the first time in my career and in my life that I've been able to take a step back and think about what's next for me. I really want to be intentional with my next role and my next project,” Kenney, who also appeared on Happy's Place, explained. “I just want to explore a lot of different creative avenues, whether that's multicam again or movies or anything. I want to try it all. I'm definitely excited.”

The Conners airs on ABC Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET

Alison Arngrim was 48 years old when she publicly revealed she was sexually abused by a family member starting at age 6.

It was 2004 when the actress, who played mean girl Nellie Oleson in "Little House on the Prairie," first told her story to Larry King. She described how appearing in the hit TV series saved her sanity in her 2011 memoir "Confessions of a Prairie Bitch."

The star has become an advocate for child sex abuse victims, but her work is far from done, she insisted.

Arngrim is the president of the National Association to Protect Children, a nonprofit that aims to give children a legal and political voice in "the war against child abuse."

Michael Landon Didn't Allow ‘Any A--holes' On ‘Little House On The Prairie' Set: Actress

Arngrim wants to combat predators who seek places where children can be found unsupervised. Places like Hollywood continue to be a hot spot, she said.

"Hollywood still has a sex abuse problem," Arngrim told Fox News Digital. "Whenever you have an environment where there are lots of children … there's going to be predators. There's going to be someone who wants a job where they have unfettered access to young children all day. And the more that job involves completely unsupervised access to children, the more attractive that job is going to be."

"We have lots of people who have sacrificed their whole lives to help children," Arngrim shared. "But, sadly, there are others who aren't that way."

According to the organization's website, it has worked in Congress and in over 27 states to craft legislation that leads to stronger, tougher laws that combat child exploitation.

"There's a lot to do," said Arngrim. "We all think if someone gets arrested for child molestation, sexual abuse, they will go to jail, and they will be on a sex offender's list. But that's not always the case. There are cases where they are let go, which is bonkers.

"We are looking for those loopholes in many states to help protect children. … If you're in a state that doesn't have specific rules and laws on set, especially for working children [in the entertainment industry], that's a problem. And we need to address it."

Arngrim admitted that, for years, she kept her childhood abuse a secret out of shame. Getting the chance to finally tell her story was freeing.

"The focus and shame are often put on the victim," said Arngrim. "But shouldn't it be on the person who did this?... When the Larry King episode aired, I felt like a weight was off my shoulders."

For Arngrim, pain turned into purpose.

"There are laws that say a child can only work so many hours at a store, but those same laws don't always apply to a child on a film or TV set," she said. "They're exempt. Laws were created in California where you have massive regulations, but some unscrupulous producers will shoot shows in other parts of the country so that they do not have to follow any of those regulations."

Arngrim noted that, as a child actress, she felt safe on the set of "Little House on the Prairie," which aired from 1974 to 1983.

"We had major regulations and, thank God, we followed them to the letter," she explained. "And [director] Michael Landon started working [in Hollywood] when he was really young. And look, he was hardly Pa Ingalls. He smoked and drank. He knew what the world outside ‘Little House' could be. [But] it was important for him to create a safe space for his crew.

"He came from ‘Bonanza,' and many of the crew members came from the show too, so he had already known them for years, long before he started ‘Little House,'" Arngrim shared. "And many of them followed him to ‘Highway to Heaven.' Many of the extras, the kids you saw in the schoolrooms, were children of the crew members, the electricians. Everyone was on set.

"He also prioritized school," Arngrim continued. "He made sure our teachers were there with a stopwatch to make sure we didn't miss out on class. He made sure we always had lunch. I even remember when Michael's kids would be on set. The rule was they could only be on the set during their summer breaks if their grades were at the proper level and their schoolwork was done well. Otherwise, they had to go to summer school. They couldn't just hang out on the set."

Her castmates weren't exempt. They were also required to have good grades.

"Nothing got past Michael," Arngrim chuckled. "He wanted to do things by the book. He also wanted everybody to go home at a reasonable time so they could spend time with their families. And with having such a huge kids cast, I'm sure he was relieved too. But I remember we would be done by 5, and everyone was out the door. Sure, you could spend another hour or two shooting a few scenes, especially the adults. But Michael made sure we were on our way home by 6 for dinner. And it worked."

Landon died in 1991 at age 54 from pancreatic cancer.

WATCH: ‘LITTLE HOUSE' STAR MICHAEL LANDON WAS STUBBORN ABOUT HIS HEALTH: DAUGHTER

"I felt very safe on the ‘Little House' set," Arngrim reflected. "I felt that if we ever went to any one of the crew members and said, ‘This person is bothering me,' we wouldn't find the body for weeks. It was just an extraordinarily protective set. It was an excellent atmosphere. Michael wanted this show to thrive. And if the kids weren't taken care of, and we weren't following the rules, we wouldn't have a show.

"Not mistreating your children is the more profitable move."

Today, Arngrim hopes parents eager to put their kids in showbiz will look for telltale signs of trouble.

"There's always going to be a predatory problem, especially in Hollywood, because it's so easy," she said. "Look at how many parents are so desperate to see their kids become famous. … People can get crazy with [the idea of fame].

"If they meet someone who says they're a manager, an agent, a photographer or talent scout, and they want to be alone with your kid, or they want to take your kid to a different location for an audition or whatever … they'll just see this promise of fame. And things will happen. It happens all the time.

"That's a problem. Parents will drop their kids off at a guy's house, no questions asked, because they'll say, ‘Well, this person said my child will be on TV,'" she added. "Meanwhile, the predator is thinking, ‘I've hit the jackpot.'

"That's why they're predators. They look for the weak spots. They look for the kid from the broken home, the kid having trouble in school, the kid whose parents are maybe working two to three jobs and maybe aren't paying attention. … We need to be vigilant in this business. … It's gotten better since my day, but there's more to be done."

Kelly Clarkson is reflecting on how the music industry's attitude towards singing competition shows has changed over the years.

The 42-year-old singer, who won the first season of American Idol in 2002, said that many of her peers judged her for getting her start on a singing competition show. 

However, some of them ironically later became judges on another popular singing competition show, The Voice. 

“People that were really mean have been coaches. [They] hated talent shows, and they ended up being on The Voice,” Kelly revealed on Kylie Kelce's Not Gonna Lie podcast.

Without naming names, Kelly then said that while people in the industry originally turned their nose at her, they eventually started coming around when singing competition shows became more prevalent. 

“People were really cruel at first. They didn't like it. It took the industry kind of by storm, the talent shows. It was a very unlikable thing in the industry concerning the populous. Now there's so many,” she added. 

Kelly also became a coach on The Voice herself, and said that her background gave her valuable insight and empathy towards contestants. 

“People like us who have been there in that audition process, and just being so judged instantaneously, on maybe not your best performance but you know you can do better. It's a grueling thing,” she said. 

She continued, “It's unforgiving in a lot of ways, and a lot of pressure for these artists that I don't think a lot of artists that sell tons of records would be able to handle. It's a different thing.”

Meanwhile, the season 1 top 10 finalists of American Idol have all gone on to do different things with their careers.

Lil Nas X reveals that he and Taylor Swift almost collaborated on a track. 

The 25-year-old rapper said that he and the "Fortnight" singer were in the early stages of creating a song together, but things didn't end up working out for the project. 

“We were working on something. She offered to let me try a verse on something, but I couldn't catch a vibe for it, so it didn't happen,” he told E! News in a recent interview.

The "Industry Baby" singer said that he “even want to talk about” what he and Taylor could've created together. 

“I'm thankful that she even considered me,” he said.

Kim Kardashian is manifesting a new beau. 

On a recent episode of The Kardashians on Hulu, the 44-year-old SKIMS founder reveled that she is designing a closet space for her future hypothetical boyfriend while renovating her home.  

“Who's him?” Kim‘s mother, Kris Jenner, inquired. 

“I don't know,” Kim responded. “I won't be open to having a partner if I don't build it.”

Kris, 69, later said in a confessional that “there's not a him,” when it comes to Kim‘s relationship status, but she does think that her daughter is currently “looking for true love.”

“She's the best version of Kim when she's in love,” she said. 

Kim‘s ex-husband, Kanye West, has been the subject to much controversy lately, including his concerning behavior on social media. 

Kim and Kanye were married for nearly seven years before divorcing in 2021. They are parents to North, 11, Saint, 9, Psalm, 5, and Chicago, 7.

Last month, Kim opened up about still having “good vibes” with Kanye.

Sean Kingston and his mother, Janice Turner, have both been found guilty of fraud. 

On Friday (March 28), the 35-year-old rapper and Janice were found guilty of all charges by a federal jury in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, according to CBS News. 

Sean and Janice were both found guilty of one count of conspiracy to commit fraud and four counts of wire fraud. They now await sentencing, and both face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for each count. Sean has been placed on house arrest until sentencing.

Last year, the two were arrested and indicted for an alleged “scheme to defraud victim sellers of high-end specialty vehicles, jewelry, and other goods purchased by the defendants through the use of fraudulent documents,” according to the United States Attorney's Office in the Southern District of Florida.

The allegations in the indictment state the mother-son duo “unjustly enriched themselves by falsely representing that they had executed bank wire or other monetary payment transfers as payment for vehicles, jewelry, and other goods purchased by the defendants, when in fact no such bank wire or other monetary payment transfers had been executed by the purported banks, and thereafter the defendants retained or attempted to retain the vehicles, jewelry and other goods despite non-payment. Through the execution of this scheme, the defendants obtained in excess of $1 million in property.”

Shortly after his arrest in 2024, the “Beautiful Girls” singer addressed the situation on his Instagram story.
