                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen offers Washington a dialogue about a stronger military presence in Greenland.

He also has a clear message to the US Vice President J.D. Vance, criticizing the rhetoric of the Republican.

Rasmussen emphasizes the importance of diplomacy and offers discussions about a stronger US military presence in Greenland.

The joint defense agreement of 1951 offers extensive options for this, according to Rasmussen.

The Danish Foreign Minister states how the United States has drastically reduced its military presence on the island belonging to Denmark since 1945.

"We can do a lot more within the agreement we have," said Rasmussen.

Specifically, he replied to Vance's criticism of Copenhagen: "(...) fact is that we all benefited from peace.

We all acted in the assumption that the Arctic was a region of low tensions. But these times are over. The status quo is not an option."

Denmark has therefore already decided one billion US dollars (around 920 million euros) in investments in the security of the Arctic.

It should also not be forgotten that Greenland is part of NATO, added Rasmussen.

Hundreds gathered in front of the US embassy in Denmark's capital Copenhagen to demonstrate against the US fantasies of a takeover of Greenland.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The American President wants to expand his ideological campaign abroad.

According to the "Financial Times", the Trump government calls on a number of EU companies to hire programs for diversity, justice and inclusion.

A letter was sent by the US embassy in Paris and several other diplomatic representations in the EU, affecting companies that work as a service provider or supplier for the US government-even if they are outside the USA.

The questionnaire entitled "Certification on compliance with the applicable federal antidis crimination law" states: "Commitment to the US State Department must certify that they do not operate programs, promote the DEI and violate applicable anti-discrimination laws."

It also says: "You recognize that this certificate is essential for the government's payment decision and is therefore subject to the False Claims Act."

Europe reacts shocked to the demand

The French Ministry of Finance was informed by affected companies and reacted critically. A confidante of Economics Minister Eric Lombard said: "This practice reflects the values ​​of the new US government. They are not the same as ours."

France will also make it clear to the US authorities.

Legal experts doubt the enforceability of this extraterritorial measure

The first assessments assume that it is not legally binding. Some companies have therefore decided not to react for the time being.

The advance takes place in the middle of growing tensions between the USA and Europe-including new US tariffs on European car, steel and aluminum imports.

Companies from the aviation, defense, consulting and infrastructure industry could be affected.

The letter ends with the note: "If you do not want to sign this document, we would be grateful if you could give us detailed reasons that we will forward to our legal department."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Robert Geiss is said to be a Rolex and Hublot fan.

Robert Geiss has built up a public image as a jet set millionaire-with yachts, villas and striking fashion. The 61-year-old apparently also has a large collection of luxury watches. He is said to be a Rolex and Hublot fan. He recently gave his wife Carmen a Patek Philippe.


At the moment, however, the facade seems to crumble a bit. As research by Business Insiders show, the luxury hotel "Maison Prestige Roberto Geissini" operated by Robert and Carmen Geiss on the Côte d’Azur is auctioned off. The background is a million dispute in which the Geissens are involved.


But: Robert Geiss is not only known as an entrepreneur-but also as a gifted watch fan. According to the matching media reports, the 61-year-old has a large collection of luxury watches, and also likes to give away a fashion.

1. Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Offshore Rubens Barrichello II

This watch with motorsport cover was stolen from the day24 in 2009 in a slump in his villa in Saint-Tropez-and surprisingly reappeared in Hong Kong 15 years later. A watchmaker recognized the serial number and initiated the return.

The clock was limited to 1000 pieces, consists of titanium, has a black ceramic desire and a skeletonized dial. The Kaliber work 2326/2840 offers around 38 hours of gear reserve. It costs around 30,000 euros.


2. Rolex Daytona

Robert Geiss has been spotted several times with different models of the Rolex Daytona. Concrete model names are not publicly documented, but pictures from different press articles and TV episodes show him with golden variants of the iconic chronograph.

The Daytona is known for its sporty design and is powered by the Rolex internal caliber 4130. The watch has a diameter of 40 mm and a gear reserve of about 72 hours.


3. Patek Philippe Women's World Century 7130G

In 2020, Robert gave his wife Carmen Geiss this exclusive world time clock, as TAG24 reported. Patek Philippe 7130G shows 24 time zones at the same time, has a 36-millimeter housing made of white gold, a Guilloche dial and a bezel-occupied bezel.

It is powered by the automatic caliber 240 HU. According to the report, the price was around 44,000 euros.


4. Hublot Big Bang

In several episodes of "Die Geissens", Robert Geiss can be seen with striking, large-format models of the Hublot Big Bang-including variants with skeletal dial and striking colors.

The Big Bang is characterized by its massive design and the combination of different materials such as ceramics, carbon or precious metal.


5. Richard Mille RM 50-03 McLaren F1

In 2023, an Instagram video caused a stir in which Geiss kept a supposed Richard Mille RM 50-03 in the camera. According to Nau.ch, it was a plagiarism - experts realized based on details that the watch was not real.

At that time, Robert Geiss did not comment on these allegations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Billionaire Klaus-Michael Kühne expressed skepticism about the feasibility of the construction project, warning of financial bottlenecks and lack of interest from potential tenants.

The city of Hamburg is examining the opportunity to accommodate a natural history museum in the Elbtower.

Klaus-Michael Kühne mentioned financial bottlenecks and lack of interest as the main reasons for the uncertainty.

The Hamburger Elbtower is facing an uncertain future, according to Kühne.

The billionaire and potential investor expressed skepticism about the project's future in the "Spiegel": "I don't think it can be realized".

Kühne said his participation in the Kühne-Holding was limited to a maximum of 100 million euros.

This would result in a large financing gap, with 400 million needed but only one other investor apart from him.

The project was originally initiated by the insolvent Signa Prime Selection AG by the Austrian entrepreneur René Benko.

Talks are currently underway between the provisional insolvency administrator and an investor consortium under the direction of the real estate entrepreneur Dieter Becken.

These negotiations are limited exclusively and time until the end of April.

Kühne expressed itself pessimistically: "It may well be that the Elbtower remains a ruin", and further: "In a year or two the city would come to the train and would tear it down".

The city of Hamburg is considering accommodating the planned natural history museum in the Elbtower.

Mayor Peter Tschentscher and his deputy Katharina Fegebank were generally open to the museum plans - provided they are economically viable.

Kühne warned: "The move of the Natural History Museum is not in dry cloths".</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US President Trump wants to revive shipbuilding in the USA by threatening shipping companies worldwide with immense port fees.

European shipping companies would be affected immediately, as they obtain many of their merchant ships from China. 
According to Allianz, the penalty ships built by Trump would result in concrete consequential damage to the European economy.

Anastasios Leonburg, a risk engineer at Allianz Commercial, stated that Europe continued to build merchant ships under the influence of Chinese shipbuilding industry dominance. 
The Chinese build thousands of ships and maybe ten in the USA each year.

Trump provides a million dollar fee to enter US ports for ships built in China. 

Ships from all nations built in China are said to pay up to $1.5 million when entering a US port. 
This announcement has not caused much of a stir in Europe because it does not directly oppose the EU.

Leonburg stated that the fees for Chinese and China-built ships would generally make the port start more expensive, forcing shipowners to change their costs.

Shipowners will have to consider whether they start using US ports three times. 
Consumers in the USA will quickly feel this impact.

Europe has low shipbuilding capacities and cannot do without Chinese ships due to a lack of suitable yards.

Leonburg stated that there are not enough German or European shipyards for large shipping companies to build their own ships.

The Chinese have acquired know-how, which is slowly being lost in Germany. 
The majority of container and cargo ships today are built in China.

Leonburg concluded that the tariffs and increased port fees ultimately meet everyone, including American consumers and logistics companies.</p>

Both companies are privately held, which means they are not required to disclose their finances to the public.

Mr Musk said in a post on X that the move will “unlock immense potential by blending xAI’s advanced AI capability and expertise with X’s massive reach.”

He said the deal values xAI at $80bn (£61.8bn) and X at $33bn.

Mr Musk bought the site then called Twitter for $44bn (£34bn) in 2022, gutted its staff and changed its policies on hate speech, misinformation and user verification and renamed it X.

He launched xAI a year later.

“xAI and X’s futures are intertwined. Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent."

This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI’s advanced AI capability and expertise with X’s massive reach,” Mr Musk wrote on X.

The combined company will deliver smarter, more meaningful experiences to billions of people while staying true to our core mission of seeking truth and advancing knowledge.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hytro, an English fitness tech company, has partnered with Manchester City Women ahead of their Champions League quarter-final second leg.

The performance partnership will see the team utilise Hytro wearables and technology as part of its world-leading approach to athletic performance and recovery.

Hytro's patented blood flow restriction (BFR) clothing is designed to help athletes train more effectively and recover quicker, with over 200 professional sports teams across various leagues using their products.

Blood flow restriction – a compression around the top of the thigh or arm to temporarily reduce circulation – increases muscle stress and makes training more impactful and efficient.

The results are stronger muscles, less recovery time, and reduced soreness, according to scientific studies cited by Hytro.

Hytro's technology may also have a vital application for astronauts, as muscle mass and bone density can be affected by spending time in microgravity.

The Fram2 mission, operated by Elon Musk’s SpaceX, will test the use of Hytro's BFR products during exercise in space.

During the three-to-five-day mission, the crew will wear blood flow restriction products made by Hytro and Delfi Medical Innovations.

The tests are part of a project in collaboration with several universities and space technology leaders.

This study is a massive step for Hytro and the wider BFR community, according to Dr Joe Handsaker, Hytro's chief innovation officer.

If successful, it could unlock new research into exercise efficiency in micro-gravity and even accelerate Musk's quest to populate other planets.

Maintaining muscle mass and function is crucial not only for spaceflight but also for everyday lives, said co-study lead Dr Tom Maden-Wilkinson.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US Minister of Homeland Protection Kristi NoEM wore a Rolex worth $ 50,000 during a visit to the prison.

The luxury watch is contrasting to the detained Venezuelan migrants who were deported without legal proceedings. Noem, which was appointed by Trump, pursues a strict migration policy and defends your clock buying as a personal memorial.


Critics complain about the optics: a populist government that pretends to represent the people, while their top politicians appear with luxury goods. Lawyer Tristan Snell wrote on X: "Explain to me again why these Trumpians are supposed to be normal people - and not rich oligarchs who loot America."


The Ministry of Homelands reacted and defended NoEM. Spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the minister bought the Rolex from the revenue of her bestseller. The clock should therefore become a special memorial that one day they want to bequeath their children.


Noem, former governor of South Dakota, was appointed head of the Ministry of Internal Security by Donald Trump. Since then she has been pursuing a hard line in migration policy. Recently, she had around 200 Venezuelan men deported to the Salvadorian terrorism prison, citing a rarely used war law-the one that she now visited.

In a video published on X, she said: "Anyone who comes to our country illegally must expect consequences."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to the personnel consultant Kristine Capek, the key to a successful job interview is competence-based questions, which enable a precise assessment.

The application process is no longer just about a one-sided assessment - rather about getting to know each other at eye level.

Companies should specifically ask about applicants' motivation - for example: "Why did you apply for this position?"

An ideal interview starts with small talk, creating a pleasant atmosphere and relaxing the situation.

This is followed by a brief introduction to the company and hiring management, but short and concise, as the focus is on the applicant, not the management or team.

Many companies present themselves in detail, while applicants lose themselves in irrelevant details.

Companies should target the interview and ask more specific questions, rather than saying "Tell something about yourself."

The key to a successful interview is competence-based questions.

For a successful interview, companies define in advance exactly which skills are required for the open position.

Applicants should focus on the skills and strengths they have developed in previous roles and what added value they could offer in their potentially new role.

One question that is often asked from above and puts applicants under pressure is "Why should we hire you?"

This question is a warning signal, says Kristine Capek, as it creates an unnecessary sales situation.

Companies should formulate the question differently to put applicants less under pressure - for example: "Why did you apply for this position?"

The latter question aims at what applicants are interested in the position and the company.

Applicants can react confidently to problematic questions by answering with a professional explanation of their qualifications.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A dozen German men have already been in space - but no woman yet.

That should change with the Berliner Rabea Rogge. She wants to fly around the poles for days with a SpaceX team.

Rabea Rogge from Berlin could be the first German woman in space. On Tuesday morning, Rogge is scheduled to start Central Europe from the Cape Canaveral space station in the US state of Florida on board a "Dragon" capsule and with the help of a Falcon 9 rocket by Tech-billionaire SpaceX.


According to the German Aerospace Center (DLR), twelve German men were so far, but not a German woman in space. There were several candidates and reserve room drivers, but a woman has never really flown.

The mission called "Fram2" - named after a Norwegian polar research ship from the 19th century - is expected to take around four days. The "Dragon" capsule is to fly over the polar regions of the earth on a new orbit.


For "FRAM2", as in the past, a billionaire has once again commissioned the SpaceX company to carry out a mission for private interest. This time it was the Maltese Chun Wang who has become rich with cryptocurrencies and is also flying along.

The filmmaker Jannicke Mikkelsen from Norway and the Polar Guide Eric Philips from Australia are also part of the crew. "I look forward to starting with this incredible crew," wrote the 29-year-old Rogge on the online platform X.


Months of intensive preparation for space

The German is officially involved in the mission as a scientific specialist. She studied electrical engineering and information technology at ETH Zurich.

In doing so, she also worked on a concept of a nanosatellite centrifuge in a low orbit. For her doctoral thesis, she switched to the technical and scientific university of Norway.


Rogge and the rest of the crew have been preparing for the mission with intensive training for months. Among other things, various scenarios and the reactions on it were played through in the SpaceX training capsule.

There were also medical training and training sessions for the planned scientific experiments. "The technical background is the easiest for me because I recognize many of the systems from my time as a system engineer in the satellite project," Rogge told the German Press Agency a few months ago.


Space training even in Alaska

In addition, the room suits of the four crew members were precisely adjusted and there were exercises for group dynamics, such as a sea kayak training in Alaska.

The team welded that together, said Rogge. "To defy the wilderness in wet clothes for seven days has already brought us together."


Rogge wants to take a commemorative medal to the flight pioneer Otto Lilienthal (1848-1896) and a small replica of the freedom bell in the town hall in Berlin-Schöneberg-the district in which it was born.

On other astronauts, they admire the calm they radiated, says Rogge. Hopefully she will never experience a stressful situation in space-"but in my opinion the NASA astronauts that I have met so far have always broadcast a lot of version and calm".


"Huge joy" in German space travel

From the German space agency in the German Aerospace Center (DLR) it says that you are very happy about the start of Rogge.

"For the first time, a German woman flies into space, not in a state program, but with a private initiative," said Walther Pelzer, DLR board member and general director of the German space agency.


"This shows how much strength can be in private initiatives," said Pelzer of the German Press Agency. "I very much hope that Rabea Rogge and 'Fram2 ′ enthusiasm for the young generation awakens for science and engineering professions."


Expert Wörner: "Certainly a great experience"

According to Europe's former space chief Jan Wörner, the mission "is certainly a great experience for the crew".

He hopes that the increased radiation on the Poles does not lead to health consequences. "The reason for the Northern Lights is the fact that the magnetic field of the earth concentrates the particles coming from the sun there," said Wörner.


"It would be very nice if scientific results were achieved through the mission."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Luxury watches are often timeless classics that combine style and precision.

Expert Roger Rüegger emphasizes that mechanical watches are made forever and steel clocks are currently popular.

The Rolex Submariner and Patek Philippe Nautilus are considered coveted models with high market prices.

Regardless of whether as a status symbol, value system or as an expression of style awareness: some luxury watches survive trends and generations. They have long been a classic of watchmaking and inspire with timeless design, precision and history.

The taste of luxury watches changes. Mechanical watches are literally made for eternity, and industry is also cyclical.

Steel clocks of the well-known brands are currently very popular. "However, we observe a trend towards precious metals and minor diameters." The chance that a brand of the well-known brands will still be en vogue in ten years is therefore given.

The specialist emphasizes that the popularity of individual models can increase over the years. Luxury watches such as the Royal Oak and the Nautilus were not the big racers in the 70s, in the 80s they were still in the expenses.

Today the models are considered an absolute top seller. The best choice is always the clock that comes closest to your own taste and your own expectations." This could be aware, but there are several other factors.

The more classic a watch, the greater the chance to have a timeless classic that can still be brought in by a watchmaker in 50 years.

1. Rolex Submariner

The submarine from Rolex is the epitome of the diving watch. Since its introduction in 1953 it has stood for robustness and clear design. Typical are the rotatable diving bezel, the oyster housing and the good readability.

2. Patek Philippe Nautilus

The Nautilus was designed by Gérald Genta in 1976 and is now one of the most sought-after sports watches in the luxury segment. Flat stainless steel housing with striking "ears", integrated band, mostly with horizontal strip dial.

3. Audemars Piguet Royal Oak

Also a draft of Genta, presented in 1972. The Royal Oak set new standards in the area of ​​sporty luxury watches with its octagonal housing, the screw bezel and the "tapiss series" dial.

4. Cartier tank / santos

Both models are among the classics of the watch design. The rectangular tank was designed in 1917, inspired by tank chains.

5. Omega Speedmaster Professional

Known as a "Moonwatch", as it was worn on the moon in 1969. Hand elevator (caliber 3861), hesalite or sapphire glass, chronograph with 3 totalists.

6. Jaeger-Lecoultre Reverso

The reverso dates from the 1930s and was developed for polo players. The rectangular housing can be rotated to protect the dial - often used as a design element today.

7. Breitling navitimer

A classic among the aviation chronographs - with a sliding slide out for navigation.</p>

He knows: "In this price segment, most buyers demand after a clockwork from their own production. However, there are hardly any works that have been elaborately refined by hand." The proportion of stainless steel in sales still makes up about two thirds here.

These luxury watches cost less than 10,000 euros

Nevertheless: which wants to spend less than 10,000 euros on a luxury watch, a model can find from a well -known manufacturer - including a Rolex or an omega. “If you are looking for particularly complex watch works, such as those with eternal calendars, tourbillon or minute repetition, it will be here

Not yet looking for it,” said the expert.

The experts have revealed a total of seven luxury watch models that cost less than 10,000 euros.

The Submariner Date (16610) is a classic among the diving watches and was produced by Rolex between 1989 and 2010. It is considered a neo-vintage model and is often seen as an entry-level model in the world of Rolex sports models. With its 40-millimeter housing, aluminum bezel and the caliber 3135, it embodies the traditional Rolex DNA without modern revision.

Thanks to its simple design, its robust construction and iconic status, it is particularly popular with collectors who value classic Rolex aesthetics. In terms of price, it is currently still (as of 2025) below 10,000 euros, which makes it attractive compared to current submarin references. Therefore, the luxury watch is at the top of the Balazs Ferenczi recommendation list.

2. The Omega Speedmaster Professional - 7600 euros 

The Speedmaster Professional (310.42.50.01.001), also known as “Moonwatch”, is an omega icon among the chronographs. This current version remains true to the original design: hesalit glass, 42-mill lodge and the hand elevator Kaliber 3861, which is now certified as a master chronometer.

With a price of almost 7600 euros, it is a classic with history and technical development, says Roger Rüegger. The Speedmaster is a permanent reference, especially for lovers of luxury watches with a soft spot for space travel or mechanical chronographs.</p>

The cars will be recovered by a special company and the extinguishing measures have ended. Burning Tesla vehicles have become more common in recent months, according to the Washington Post.

Violent attacks on the group's vehicles are piling up. The attacks target dealers, superchargers, and vehicles, resulting in significant damage.

A global protest called "Tesla Takedown" is planned for this Saturday. The protest aims to take place on all continents, including metropolises like New York, London, and Paris.

Around 500 protests are scheduled worldwide. Demonstrations will also be held outside Tesla showrooms in the US, with plans to block charging stations, or superchargers.

The activists criticize Tesla's business practices and Elon Musk's personal role in politics. They accuse Musk of work exploitation, environmental degradation, and attacks on democratic values.

Criticism is also directed at Musk's support for austerity measures in US authorities under Donald Trump.</p>
