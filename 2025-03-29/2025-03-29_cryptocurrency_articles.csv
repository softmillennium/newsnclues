In the last 24 hours, more than $ 300 million in long positions have been settled in centralized cryptocurrency bags, while US $ 38.8 million in short positions have been settled on these platforms, according to Coinglass.

The fall seems to be part of a broader risk reduction movement among traders, as investors are anticipating the impact of President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs, which are expected to take effect on April 2. The movement intensified after the data core of personal consumption expenses (PCE) was warmer than expected on Friday.

This week alone, consumer confidence data fell more than expected, while future expectations reached a 12 -year -old, well below the levels associated with an imminent recession.

The narrative

The US Securities Commission seems to have closed almost all of its pending cases related to cryptocurrencies - at least publicly disclosed - in the last two months since Mark Uyeda has taken over as interim president of the agency. In many of the Court's file, SEC has argued that it needs to remove these cases while the new regulator's crypto task force reevaluates as exactly applies securities laws to digital assets, although in at least some of these cases is leaving any resource to process again if you find out that some previously asset cryptocurrencies are indeed securities.

FTX’s collapse left a financial crater and a trail of frustrated creditors—many of whom expected to be repaid in crypto, not dollars. Since the bankruptcy, the price of bitcoin has more than quadrupled, intensifying frustrations among those waiting for their assets back.

The task of unwinding FTX’s balance sheet has been slowed by a large number of claims, many of them reportedly questionable. Andrew Dietderich, a bankruptcy attorney for the firm, told the court that FTX has received “27 quintillion” claims, Blloomberg reported, many of which are duplicates or outright fraudulent.

Interest payments are compounding the urgency. While FTX earns only a modest return on its cash, legitimate creditors are entitled to 9% interest annually on unpaid claims. The longer it takes to pay, the more the company could owe.

This movement has intensified after Core data on personal consumer expenditure (PCE) has become higher than expected on Friday.

Only this week, this week, consumer confidence data has dropped more than expected, while the future expectations index has been established at a lower level for 12 years, and below the levels associated with an imminent recession.

This conjunction of factors prompted investors to reduce their exposure to risky assets and triggered a safety leak. The latest Coindesk Data report on the stablecoins shows that the cryptocurrencies backed by gold have benefited from this drop in risk, their market capitalization having increased. A dollar $ 1.4 billion in March.

Cryptocurrencies backed by gold thwart the downward trend of the market. While the CD20 has lost more than 3 % in the past 24 hours, tokens like Paxg and XAUT increased by 0.7 % to more than $ 3,100.

This new fresh stock sales plan follows a previous ATMoff, which was up to $ 1.5 billion for the minor.

Mara has adopted Michael Saylor's strategy of raising funds through equity and convertible bond and bits bitcoin on the free market. The minor now has 46,376 BTC in his cash, making it the second largest reserve of Bitcoin among the listed companies, behind the 506,137 BTC of Strategy.

The Bitcoin purchase project on the free market was adopted by minors last year, even if they can theoretically undermine bitcoin at a price lower than the spot price. The sector has become difficult after the reduction in half of last year's mining awards, reducing beneficiary margins due to the cost increase. The purchase of bitcoin on the free market, in parallel with mining, has therefore become a relatively more judicious strategy for minors.

The story

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States seems to have closed almost all of its pending files linked to cryptocurrencies-at least those made public-during the last two months, since the taking of Mark Uyeda's office in the agency's interim presidency. In many court documents, the SEC has argued that it had to classify these files while its new working group on crypto re -evaluates its precise application of laws on securities to digital assets. However, in some of these files, the SEC does not reserve any recourse to bring new proceedings if it noted that certain cryptocurrencies resulting from previous proceedings are indeed securities.

The feedback gathered from the community during the Testnet phase enabled the Kite AI team to resolve key issues, enhance system performance, and make architectural improvements. As a result, the Testnet is now more stable, scalable, and feature-complete in preparation for future phases of the network.

Kite AI is built around a novel consensus mechanism called Proof of Attributed Intelligence (Proof of AI), which ensures fair attribution and transparent rewards for contributors across agents, models, and data. Their innovative architecture establishes a universal framework with purpose-built identity and attribution mechanisms, empowering contributors—from enterprises to individuals—to collaboratively build, own, and monetize AI, fostering a transparent and interoperable ecosystem.

As an Avalanche Sovereign L1 chain, Kite AI will harness the AI specific consensus and infrastructure for Avalanche, while providing a tailor-made environment for AI, data analytics, and decentralized applications.

Kite AI’s Testnet has attracted a growing community of developers building a wide range of AI-native applications, from decentralized co-pilots and data markets to autonomous financial agents. The Testnet continues to serve as a proving ground for programmable AI infrastructure, and work is now underway on Testnet v2, which will introduce additional capabilities and performance enhancements.

https://decrypt.co,Why 'Tiger King' Joe Exotic Launched a Solana Meme Coin From Behind Bars,https://decrypt.co/312192/tiger-king-joe-exotic-solana-meme-coin,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 17:51:48 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Why did Joseph Maldonado-Passage, better known as Joe Exotic from the viral Netflix docuseries “Tiger King,” debut a meme coin on Solana from prison earlier this week?

“I’m knee-deep in lawyer bills,” he told Decrypt in an interview, claiming the endeavor will also benefit children through donations to a nonprofit called Operation Smile.

The 62-year-old, who has lived behind bars for seven years, didn’t launch the meme coin himself. Instead, he said his lawyers helped him get “Official Tiger King” off the ground, which began trading under the ticker name EXOTIC on Monday.

Most celebrity meme coins end up as flash in the pan. Their value often hinges on people’s attention, which can fade quickly. Others end up marred by allegations of insider trading. Exotic said he’s hopeful that his token doesn’t end up becoming yet another example.

this right here too. Dont forget all of this. You wont find a more honest celebrity coin. Track the wallets, they are all on https://t.co/NoBlv57TF8 . When @realDonaldTrump pardons me, imagine the market cap then If you heard me on spaces last night, we are just starting. Its… https://t.co/moNCRG63pl — Joe Exotic (@joe_exotic) March 28, 2025

“I pray to god that they don’t rug it and ruin my reputation,” the former wildlife park owner said. “I'm hoping that people will see this is legit and it has a purpose.”

Celebrity meme coins, while nothing new, reached a boiling point last year, with names like Caitlyn Jenner, Jason Derulo, and Cardi B stepping into the space. Hailey Welch, also known as “Hawk Tuah girl,” was among those that got caught flat-footed. Her coin, dubbed HAWK, became a fiasco after it imploded. A spokesperson told Decrypt she “had zero control over it.”

EXOTIC debuted on a little-known launchpad called pumpkin.fun. The meme coin’s market cap initially surged to $900,000 but has since fallen to just over $100,000, according to the crypto data provider GeckoTerminal. It has less than 900 holders in total, per blockchain data.

The website for Exotic’s meme coin does not reference the project’s goal of contributing funds to Operation Smile. However, it does say tokens will be donated to a “foundation supporting tigers or animal health” upon his release from prison. On Friday, Exotic’s account on X, formerly known as Twitter, said it had already donated $1,000 to the nonprofit.

Exotic says his lawyers got behind the idea of launching a meme coin as a way to showcase his commitment to charitable work. That’s a reason for him to be free, he said, as opposed to “sitting in here, watching people do drugs all day.”

Project Smiles and Exotic’s lawyers did not respond to requests for comment from Decrypt.

Exotic is currently being held at FMC Fort Worth, an administrative security center, according to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons He routinely uses the telephone to connect with the outside world, keeping fans up-to-date via podcasts and X Spaces.

When it comes to crypto, Exotic has been able to absorb a lot, even learning from other inmates. While familiar with key terms, his real-word experience is admittedly limited.

“There's not a lot to do all day besides sit and talk to people who know shit,” he said. “I do a lot from here, but I don’t even know how to set up a wallet.”

Proud of my boy! — Joe Exotic (@joe_exotic) November 15, 2024

In 2021, Joe Exotic was resentenced to 21 years in federal prison, per the Associated Press. He was convicted of a murder-for-hire scheme against animal welfare activist Carole Baskin, killing five tigers, selling tiger cubs, and falsifying wildlife records.

Exotic maintains his innocence, while also pressing U.S. President Donald Trump for a pardon on social media.

In 2021, an unofficial meme coin called “Tiger King Coin” was launched as well. Exotic said he was entitled to receive 1% of its supply, but never found out who was behind the project. He fears that coin may influence people’s perceptions of the one that just launched.

Operation Smile, founded in 1982, provides cleft lip and palate repair surgeries for children across the world. Exotic hopes his meme coin can ultimately help that initiative moving forward.

“People really need to invest in it,” he said. “I would like to be able to get it up there to where I can fix 500 kids’ [faces] and pay my lawyer bills.”

Bitcoin swung up and down—as usual—over the last week, and while things were looking up midweek, familiar inflation fears helped sink the price by the time Friday rolled around.

The coin's price was recently at $82,480 per coin, according to CoinGecko, after hitting a nearly three-week high of $88,474 on Monday. As of this writing, Bitcoin is now down by almost 2% on the week.

Bitcoin's dip came after the U.S. Commerce Department reported Friday that the core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, or PCE, was up 0.4% in February—its largest monthly increase in over a year.

Traders are still hesitant with risk-assets like Bitcoin and stocks (which also dropped Friday) as persistent inflation and President Trump's trade war continue to unsettle the markets. Still, it was an interesting week for Bitcoin.

ETF action

American Bitcoin ETFs took in new investor cash each day from Monday through Thursday, Farside Investors data shows—but finally showed red on Friday amid the broader markets shock.

Even so, the week's total inflows ended up in the green at approximately $196.4 million. It may not sound like much, but after massive outflows last month, it looks like crypto investors are seeing Bitcoin's current price—24% below its January all-time high—as a buying opportunity.

GameStop hungry for orange coin

Video game retailer and popular meme stock GameStop updated its Investment Policy on Tuesday to inform investors that it would add ""certain cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin"" to its balance sheet.

The firm then said Wednesday that it would follow in the footsteps of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and raise money from investors in the form of debt to buy the asset. GameStop aims to raise $1.3 billion to aid in its Bitcoin acquisition goal.

An announcement regarding Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/gG8JRarIok — GameStop (@gamestop) March 25, 2025

GameStop first made headlines in 2021 when amateur traders started buying its moribund stock and pumping its price—leading to the meme stock phenomenon.

It's now trying to strengthen its books by buying ""digital gold."" But while the price of GME stock rose on the initial news this week, it's since plunged following word of the raise, as GameStop investors don't seem too keen on raising money for the ploy.

Miners hit Florida

Bitcoiners arrived in Fort Lauderdale this week for the world's biggest mining conference: Mining Disrupt.

Engineers from the top manufacturing companies and vendors pushed a narrative that miners should be dipping their toes into the world of AI data centers to raise their game as BTC's price dips and difficulty continues to climb.

Decrypt was there to see if it really was as simple as that, and also learned that small businesses are tempted to start the trade in their backyard—but not by mining BTC: DOGE ASICs are still hot, apparently.

Brazil to buy Bitcoin?

The world's richest country may be keen on stacking sats via a strategic reserve—but will the move inspire other nation states?

In short, it looks like it: Brazil, the second biggest economy in the America's and biggest in Latin America, might be doing so soon.

Pedro Giocondo Guerra, a bigwig in leftist President Inácio Lula da Silva's administration, said that buying and holding Bitcoin would be ""in the (country’s) public interest.""

Guerra, who is chief of staff to Vice President Geraldo Alckmin, made the comment at a congressional ceremony.

Brazil has a huge crypto market—the biggest in South America—and the Brazilian real was the worst-performing major currency last year. Politicians could be seeing an opportunity.

Trump video debunked

Here's a fun one to end the week: An obviously doctored video of President Trump started making the rounds on Facebook and Crypto Twitter, showing him cracking out the Bitcoin whitepaper in the Oval Office.

Of course, it wasn't real—but it riled up some Bitcoin supporters. And while Trump has recently embraced Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, he's hardly a longtime aficionado, having previously been a skeptic who called it a ""scam"" and said he was ""not a fan"" of Bitcoin.

Singapore, Singapore, March 29th, 2025, Chainwire

Scallop, a lending and borrowing protocol on the Sui blockchain, has recorded an impressive revenue of $79,920 over the past 24 hours, according to recent data from DeFiLlama. This achievement places Scallop second among all decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocols, trailing only Aave, a well-established name in the sector. The milestone underscores Scallop’s growing prominence within the Sui ecosystem and the broader DeFi landscape.

The Sui Ecosystem: A Foundation for Innovation

Sui, a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain launched in May 2023, has quickly emerged as a hub for scalable and efficient DeFi applications. Designed with a unique object-centric data model and powered by the Move programming language, Sui offers low transaction fees, high throughput, and robust security. These attributes have fueled significant growth in its DeFi ecosystem, with Total Value Locked (TVL) surpassing $2 billion in early 2025, as reported by DeFiLlama. The blockchain’s ability to process transactions in parallel and achieve instant finality has attracted developers and users alike, positioning Sui as a competitive player alongside established networks like Ethereum and Solana.

The Sui Foundation, the organization driving the blockchain’s development, has played a pivotal role in nurturing innovative projects. Scallop stands out as the first DeFi protocol to receive an official grant from the Sui Foundation, a testament to its strategic importance within the ecosystem. This support, combined with backing from prominent industry players such as CMS Holdings, 6th Man Ventures (6MV), UOB Venture Management, and notable individuals like Dingaling, Pentoshi, and Virtual Beacon, has provided Scallop with a strong foundation for growth.

Scallop Protocol: Redefining Lending on Sui

Scallop Lend is a peer-to-peer money market protocol built on Sui, offering users a platform to lend and borrow digital assets with institutional-grade features. Since its token generation event (TGE) a year ago, Scallop has established itself as the top lending and borrowing protocol on Sui, boasting a TVL of approximately $130.27 million as of March 29, 2025. This figure reflects a notable 34% increase over the past seven days, highlighting sustained user confidence and adoption. The protocol’s total deposits and collateral currently stand at $187 million, with cumulative revenue reaching $3.94 million.

Scallop’s design emphasizes accessibility, security, and user experience. It separates lent assets from collateral to enhance resilience and employs a vote-escrow (ve) model to incentivize borrowing activity. Under this model, users who stake Scallop’s native token, $SCA, can access higher yield rewards. To date, the community has locked more than 27 million $SCA tokens—over 10% of the total supply—for an average duration of 3.72 years, signaling strong long-term commitment to the protocol.

In the past three days, Scallop has expanded its offerings by listing the Walrus token and partnering with Binance Wallet to host a yield-focused activity. These developments reflect Scallop’s ongoing efforts to diversify its ecosystem and enhance value for users.

A Competitive Force in DeFi Lending

Scallop’s recent 24-hour revenue of $79,920 positions it as a formidable contender in the DeFi lending space, trailing only Aave, a protocol with a long-standing presence on Ethereum and other chains. With a focus on scalability and innovation, Scallop leverages Sui’s technical advantages to deliver a seamless experience for lenders and borrowers. Its open-source framework has also enabled other projects within the Sui ecosystem to build on its infrastructure, further amplifying its impact.

As the Sui ecosystem continues to mature, Scallop’s performance suggests it is well-positioned to maintain its leadership in lending and borrowing. The protocol’s combination of strategic partnerships, community engagement, and robust metrics underscores its potential to shape the future of DeFi on Sui and beyond.

About Scallop

Scallop is the pioneering Next Generation peer-to-peer Money Market for the Sui ecosystem and is also the first DeFi protocol to receive an official grant from the Sui Foundation.

The protocol offers a range of financial services, including high-interest lending, low-fee borrowing, asset management, and automated market-making (AMM) tools, all on a single platform. Additionally, Scallop provides a software development kit (SDK) that enables professional traders to easily implement complex trades, including zero-interest loans. By emphasizing security and adhering to best practices, Scallop aims to reduce the risk of malicious behavior in the DeFi space, providing users with a trustworthy and reliable platform.

What do you get when a cute dog puts on an even cuter hat? A meme coin, of course!

Meme coin investors love dogs, and a photo of a pooch sporting a pink woven hat went viral—and took the crypto world by storm, spawning its own Solana-based meme coin, Dogwifhat (WIF).

In true degen fashion, WIF is “literally just a dog wif a hat,” per its official site, with no promises of revolutionary technology or actual utility. Despite this, Dogwifhat rapidly rose to become one of the biggest meme coins by market cap after it first barked in November 2023, even as its value has fluctuated wildly over time.

What is WIF?

Dogwifhat (WIF) is a meme coin built on the Solana blockchain, with a community that often says “the hat stays on” as a sign of support. It gained popularity due to die-hard support from the crypto community, led by influencers such as Ansem—who amassed a sizable following while championing the token.

There really isn’t much more to it—no high-tech barkitecture here. Like they said, it’s literally just a dog wif a hat.

The hat stays on. — Jakey (@SolJakey) April 19, 2024

WIF’s rise and fall

WIF went live in November 2023, according to a tweet from its official account, before hitting its all-time high of $4.83 and a market cap of $4.58 billion on March 31.

Early Dogwifhat pioneers struggled through the first month of “HODLing” the token, only to see substantial gains in subsequent weeks.

In December 2023, the coin saw a 2,000x price swing in a course of a single month, and one trader turned $300 of WIF that they purchased the day the token launched into $300,000. While another investor claims to have made hundreds of thousands over the same period becoming a WIF millionaire.

“The dog is wearing a hat, and every time I looked at the meme it made me laugh,” the WIF millionaire tweeted. “That’s it.”

However, while it may have avoided burning out like the majority of meme coins, WIF has displayed significant volatility over the course of its existence.

In November 2024, it almost reclaimed it all-time high, touching $4.19 and a market cap of $4.2 billion. By March 2025, however, the token had plummeted to nearly $0.43—a drop of 91% from its all-time high.

Who is the dog wif the hat?

Named Achi (previously known as Chi-Chi), the dog in question is a Shiba Inu—a popular breed of dog within the crypto community, having become the face of the original meme coin, Dogecoin.

Achi is now about six years old, with the viral photo having being taken two months after she was born on September 15, 2018.

Achi currently lives in South Korea with her owners, who personally knitted the adorable hat themselves. Initially, her owners reacted positively to their dog’s newfound fame, taking to Instagram to announce an NFT auction of the original, iconic photo of Achi.

Unfortunately, this stirred up a bone of contention with the Solana community as the NFT was being minted on the Ethereum blockchain—rather than on Solana, the home of the meme coin. This came after Achi’s parents attempted to work with a Solana developer, launching an ACHI token, but the owners were shortly rug-pulled—it’s a dog-eat-dog world. After this ruff experience, the owners turned to an Ethereum-based online community to help out. Still, the Solana community wasn't happy and complaints kept flying.

“Please don’t insult [Achi] and us,” the owners wrote in a pinned comment on the Instagram post, attempting to muzzle the haters. “You have no reason to blame us. Please cheer for us.”

On March 18, the iconic photo of Achi sold for 1,210.759 ETH (around $4.27 million at the time).

If you’re wanting more pictures of Achi, just head over to her owner's Instagram account, which has documented her life over the past six years.

Who created the Dogwifhat meme?

While we know the dog wif the hat is Achi, the meme originated from professional Fortnite player and streamer Issa, who set the picture as his Twitter profile picture in 2019—to which a user replied, “Dogwifhat.”

More people in the Fortnite scene started changing their profile pictures to the iconic dog picture, with Issa tweeting “dogwifhat taking over.” Soon players, streamers, and organizations from other esports games like Rocket League got involved.

In the meme’s next evolution, people began adding the dog’s hat to esports organizations, hypebeast brands, and other memes. This was when YouTuber Keemstar got involved, setting his Twitter profile picture to the dog wearing a hat with his logo on.

Claiming to be the creator of the dogwifhat meme, Issa sold a figurine of Achi through YouTooz. Despite this, Issa claims to have no affiliation with the Solana meme coin, nor does he have “bad blood” with the project.

In response, Issa has launched a dogwifhat token on Ethereum—with significantly less success. Meanwhile, the creators of the Solana WIF token remain completely anonymous, with no information about him, her, or them online.

Dog wif Sphere?

In February 2024, the “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign launched to raise $650,000 to get its furry, beanie-topped namesake plastered on the largest screen in the world: the Sphere in Las Vegas. By mid-March, that goal had been reached—but as of March 2025, the dog (and its hat) have yet to grace the structure.

Throughout 2024, fans of the project raised concerns that the five organizers of the fundraiser (including pseudonymous WIF bull Ansem) had gone silent about the plans. By June, one of the organizers, Mihiri, promised that if the campaign was cancelled the funds would be returned.

These funds are held in a multi-sig wallet, which requires multiple wallets to sign a transaction in order for it to be processed. At the time of writing, it currently holds nearly $698,000 in the USDC stablecoin, along with $842 worth of Solana (SOL), and a litter of meme coins.

On January 29, Dogwifhat’s official account tweeted “Officially confirmed. Viva hat vegas” alongside a photo of its furry mascot wearing the Sphere as a hat and holding a phone with ""Q1 2025"" showing on its screen—leading many to believe that the long-promised deal was imminent. But the tweet was quickly deleted and reposted without the “officially confirmed” tag line, while the Dogwifhat account replied, “Dates as soon as we are allowed to share,” a Dogwifhat reply said. “Hat stays on.”

Two days later, a Sphere representative told Decrypt that there is no deal to advertise Dogwifhat on its venue—and that there never was one.

“We have never had a deal with Dogwifhat, and our agency at the time only had one very preliminary conversation early last year,” a spokesperson for the venue said. “There was and is no plan for Dogwifhat to appear on the Exosphere, and we are distressed they are using our name for fraudulent purposes.”

In response, the meme coin’s official account tweeted that it was in “ongoing negotiations with various parties to collaborate on the Sphere ad placement” adding that “since the Wif team is not a corporate entity, the organizers are collaborating WITH an established brand to execute this advertisement.”

The Wif Sphere organizers have been in ongoing negotiations with various parties to collaborate on the Sphere ad placement.

However, the Sphere representative then clarified to Decrypt that ""there was and is no plan"" for Dogwifhat to appear on the venue, adding, ""At this time, Sphere only accepts advertising from exchanges and [about] Bitcoin.""

While the fundraiser’s organizers maintain that the Dogwifhat Sphere advert is on its way, users of on-chain prediction market MYRIAD (launched by Decrypt’s parent company DASTAN) remain unconvinced, with nearly 96% believing it won’t happen by the end of Q1.",decrypt
https://blockonomi.com,2 Less-Known Altcoins That Are Poised To Become The Next Cardano (ADA),https://blockonomi.com/2-less-known-altcoins-that-are-poised-to-become-the-next-cardano-ada/,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 11:44:55 GMT","Cardano (ADA) started as an under-the-radar project before skyrocketing into the crypto elite, rewarding early investors with massive gains. Now, two lesser-known altcoins, TRON (TRX) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM), are showing similar breakout potential. TRON (TRX), currently priced at $0.14, is solidifying its place as a leading blockchain for decentralized content sharing and payments, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM), trading at just $0.025, is an emerging DeFi powerhouse with innovative smart contract solutions and a tiny market cap primed for exponential growth. The project is in Phase 4 presale. Investors acquired more than 7300 presale tokens to produce a dynamic level of investor support worth $5.7 million. Mutuum Finance Phase 3 has already sold out over 93% of it. Those entering now can expect 200% returns worth $0.06 during the exchange launch period. Investors have a limited period remaining before the phase closes.

TRON’s Steady Rise: A Sleeping Giant in the Crypto Space

Unlike many speculative altcoins, TRON (TRX) has steadily built its reputation as a major player in blockchain-based entertainment and payments. Currently priced at $0.14, TRON has seen consistent adoption, particularly in decentralized applications (DApps), gaming, and stablecoin transactions, making it one of the most actively used blockchains. With its high-speed, low-fee network, TRON has positioned itself as a viable alternative to Ethereum for developers and businesses. While it may not have the explosive early-stage potential of a low-cap gem like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), TRON’s performance shows that long-term utility and adoption can drive sustainable growth, potentially leading it to rival major cryptocurrencies like Cardano (ADA) in the future.

Mutuum Finance Presale

During the pre-sale phase investors achieved an outstanding milestone by providing more than $5.7 million in funding for reaching 7400 participants. The token value of Mutuum Finance tokens showed growth during Phase 4 initial stages and continues increasing toward its launch price expectation of $0.06.

Mutuum Finance introduces a dual-lending framework which combines Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and Peer-to-Contract (P2C) to enhance decentralized loans by meeting all requirements held by borrowers and lenders.

The P2C system controls automated liquidity pools to modify interest rates which optimizes capital efficiency.

Users can establish straight loan terms when intermediaries are eliminated by P2P exchanges because this system represents a superior way of managing worldwide assets.

Users benefit from automated security for transparent transactions while having the capability to choose either fixed or variable interest rates in the system. The platform establishes trust for users because it subjects itself to external audits and makes all its smart contracts available as open-source code with full visibility.

Strategic Growth & Community Rewards

The Mutuum Finance platform undergoes continuous success development because it employs a buyback strategy together with revenue sharing (staking rewards) mechanisms within enduring economic frameworks. Future listings of new exchanges will improve inter-user accessibility while enhancing marketplace liquidity because of rising demand for this platform.

$100,000 Giveaway

Mutuum Finance rewards its first users by distributing $100,000 worth of MUTM tokens through a ten-participant giveaway with each participant receiving $10,000 in tokens. The referral program accelerates organizational growth by offering bonus rewards which users receive for introducing new investors to the community.

Early investors are seizing the moment. With Mutuum Finance (MUTM) nearing the close of Phase 3 presale, over 93% is already sold out as 7200+ investors secure their stakes in this potential DeFi breakout. Still at just $0.02, investors anticipate 200% gains when it launches at $0.06, with forecasts placing it beyond $1 in the next bull cycle. TRON (TRX) and MUTM could be the next ADA. Do not miss out before the window closes.
