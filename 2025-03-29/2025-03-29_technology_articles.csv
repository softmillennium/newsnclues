An excerpt from the upcoming book “The Optimist: Sam Altman, OpenAI, and the Race to Invent the Future” offers new details about why OpenAI’s board briefly fired CEO Sam Altman back in 2023.

Written by Wall Street Journal reporter Keach Hagey, the book claims the nonprofit’s board members became increasingly concerned after learning about issues such as an OpenAI Startup Fund that was actually personally owned by Altman.

At the same time, co-founder Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati were reportedly collecting evidence of what they saw as Altman’s toxic and dishonest behavior, complete with screenshots from Murati’s Slack channel. For example, Altman allegedly claimed the company’s legal department said GPT-4 Turbo didn’t need to be reviewed by the joint safety board, but the company’s top lawyer denied saying that.

After Sutskever provided this evidence to board members, they moved to oust Altman and appoint Murati as interim CEO. But this quickly backfired, with OpenAI employees (including Sutskever and Murati) signing a letter demanding Altman’s return — which he soon did, with Sutskever and Murati subsequently leaving to launch startups of their own.",techmeme

On Friday, Musk made a post on X, stating that the move will “unlock immense potential by blending xAI’s advanced AI capability and expertise with X’s massive reach.”

“Since its founding two years ago, xAI has rapidly become one of the leading AI labs in the world,” he wrote. “X is the digital town square where more than 600 million active users go to find the real-time source of ground truth.” Musk went on to state that xAI was valued at $80 billion, and X at “$45B less $12B debt.”

“xAI and X’s futures are intertwined,” he explained. “The combined company will deliver smarter, more meaningful experiences to billions of people while staying true to our core mission of seeking truth and advancing knowledge. This will allow us to build a platform that doesn’t just reflect the world but actively accelerates human progress.”

X CEO Linda Yaccarino supported the move, reposting Musk’s announcement and adding, “The future could not be brighter.”

It’s not clear if the move will change anything for X users.

This deal will improve the integration of Grok into X. Grok is the generative artificial intelligence chatbot created by xAI. The deal also helps share xAI’s value with Twitter’s co-investors.

xAI launched less than two years ago and has raised over $12 billion in total funding so far. Musk was also involved in the launch of xAI rival OpenAI with Sam Altman and several other founders. However, due to disagreements in the strategic direction, Musk stepped away from OpenAI. Musk ended up making a $97.4 billion bid for OpenAI in February, but that offer was declined. Musk also sued OpenAI in a federal court in California to prevent it from being converted from a non-profit to a for-profit. But a judge denied Musk’s request for a preliminary injunction that would prevent the conversion.

In 2022, Musk closed the deal to take Twitter private for $44 billion with a consortium of investors. Musk was inspired to push for the deal with a goal of pushing free speech on the platform. During the time of the deal, Musk disclosed that he had secured financing from a group of banks led by Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Barclays, MUFG, Société Générale, Mizuho Bank, and BNP Paribas.

xAI recently launched Grok 3. Grok 3 features better reasoning, speed, and decision-making. This includes “Think” mode for step-by-step problem solving and “Big Brain” for more complex tasks. Plus, the “DeepSearch” feature features real-time web research.",techmeme

ChatGPT’s new image generator launched this week, and with it came a flood of images based on art by Studio Ghibli being posted online. While the debate over whether this is horrifying (Studio Ghibli co-founder Hayao Miyazaki once said that “AI is an insult to life itself”) or cool, it does highlight one thing: Copyrights are still a concern when it comes to AI-generated anything. Although copying the art style isn’t necessarily unlawful, OpenAI training its models on Studio Ghibli’s art operates in a legal “gray area.”

“I think this raises the same question that we’ve been asking ourselves for a couple years now,” Evan Brown, an intellectual property lawyer, told TechCrunch. “What are the copyright infringement implications of going out, crawling the web, and copying into these databases?”",techmeme

The deal puts the value of xAI at $80 billion (€74 billion) and X at $33 billion (€30.5 billion). Musk, however, explained that when including X’s $12 billion debt, its overall valuation is $45 billion. Since both firms are privately owned, they do not need to release financial information publicly.

Musk thinks that new opportunities will arise when xAI’s sophisticated AI skills are combined with X’s enormous user base and data. He called their futures “intertwined” and claimed that by utilizing X’s computational power and reach, the move will hasten the development of AI.

There are no immediate changes for X users. In addition to paying consumers to use its chatbot, Grok, xAI was already leveraging X’s data to train its AI models. But in the future, this union might result in X integrating AI more deeply.

For the past few months, we have seen so many instances of intimidation by those who oppose Tesla, CEO Elon Musk, and President Donald Trump. These occurrences have been incredibly frequent and have varied in terms of their severity. It’s been as arbitrary as keying a car, and as violent as gunshots and Molotov cocktails being shot and thrown at showrooms.

The side of the perpetrators seems to be under the impression that President Trump and Musk are punishing those who have differing viewpoints as if their very livelihoods are under attack. The problem is, although government spending and some government programs are being modified or eliminated, there is no specific group being targeted, which is a big reason the use of the word “Nazi” has been baffling to me over the past few months.

That other side will have you believe there is a right-wing force that has taken over the government and aims to violate the rights of everyone who is unlike them. Ironically, it is precisely what the “protestors” are doing. Don’t agree with us? Okay. We’ll damage your vehicle.

Although the Trump administration and the FBI have set up specific measures to investigate instances of vandalism and hopefully eliminate it altogether, things have not truly calmed down. In fact, it seems it is getting worse.

However, a lawsuit filed by a victim of one of these senseless attacks has set a new precedent: damage my car, you will find yourself in a lawsuit:

🚨 The first-ever lawsuit against a man caught on video using Sentry Mode as he vandalized a Tesla has been filed. An anonymous Tesla owner has sued Rafael Hernandez, who was arrested after Sentry Mode caught video of him keying a vehicle. The Plaintiff is suing for infliction… — TESLARATI (@Teslarati) March 26, 2025

In actuality, this might be the best strategy for minimizing the instances of vandalism we have seen over the past several months. Nothing seems to be working, and the attackers, who appear to be of all shapes, sizes, and ages, only seem to be doing it more often, despite being caught on camera by Sentry Mode.

The suit that was filed against Rafael Hernandez, who keyed a Model X at DFW Airport, seeks $1m in damages. While it is unlikely he will be awarded that significant sum, what Hernandez ends up paying could be significantly more than just the amount of repairing the scratch.

This all funnels down to one specific point: Tesla drivers are simply that, people who drove to buy and drive a Tesla. Driving a car is not a political statement; it is, in many ways, simply a choice of convenience. People choose EVs for many reasons, with home charging, performance, and look being several of them.

Ask 100 Tesla owners why they bought the car, and I’m sure many would not say, “Because I love Elon Musk and agree with everything that comes out of his mouth.”

I am an Elon Musk fan, but I don’t agree with everything he has done or will do. I don’t agree with everything my parents, my friends, or my family do. I am not a loyalist to anyone except myself. This is where I find the vandalism to be so distasteful.

If Toyota’s CEO came out and said things that were controversial, for example, “We’re not transitioning to EVs because we don’t feel it’s the right time with demand,” something that was stated a few years ago as a part of their strategy, do you think Tesla owners were keying Toyotas? No.

Support brands that line up with your ideologies. Avoid ones that don’t. People of all ages do this peacefully. If you want to hurt a brand, don’t give them or their customers your money. Keying a Tesla might result in both with this initial lawsuit.

The point is, there is a right way and a wrong way to go about this. Vandalism is not the right way. Not only are you disrupting someone’s life who has nothing to do with Tesla, but now you’re putting yourself in the line of fire for a particularly substantial sum of money. Additionally, you’re not winning over any fans with this type of reaction. Nobody said “I now see their point since they keyed my car, I agree with them.”

I am hopeful that this lawsuit will encourage Tesla to go after the violent vandals who have attacked its stores. I am hopeful that this lawsuit will encourage Tesla owners to go after the violent vandals who have had their cars damaged by senseless people who have differing political views.

Perhaps this is the move that will start to bring down the frequency of these attacks.",techmeme

Story Highlights Elon Musk's xAI acquired X (formerly Twitter) in an all-stock transaction, valuing X at $33 billion, and integrating AI technology with the social media platform.

The combined valuation of xAI Holdings exceeds $100 billion.

Musk's increasing political influence, including a key role in the Trump administration, is further intertwining his business ventures with government policy.

In a surprising move, Elon Musk’s xAI startup has just acquired the platform X, formerly known as Twitter, at a jaw-dropping $33 billion valuation – shaking up the tech world once again.

Musk has never been one to play by the rules, and this latest move raises big questions. What does this mean for X’s future? How will AI change the platform?

Let’s break it all down.

A High-Stakes Transaction

Musk announced on X that his xAI company is now valued at $80 billion, while X is worth $33 billion. When including $12 billion in debt, X’s total valuation reaches $45 billion. The acquisition was structured as an all-stock deal, meaning no cash was exchanged.

@xAI has acquired @X in an all-stock transaction. The combination values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion ($45B less $12B debt).



Since its founding two years ago, xAI has rapidly become one of the leading AI labs in the world, building models and data centers at… — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 28, 2025

As a result, a new entity called XAI Holdings has been formed, with a total value exceeding $100 billion (excluding debt). Morgan Stanley acted as the sole banker for the deal, representing both sides. Musk emphasized that xAI and X will now work more closely together, using AI to enhance the platform and unlock new opportunities.

How the Deal Affects Investors

Because Musk owns both xAI and X, analysts believe this was likely a stock swap, meaning X investors will now hold shares in xAI. The two companies also share several major investors, including venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, Fidelity, Vy Capital, and Saudi Arabia’s Kingdom Holding Co.

X CEO Linda Yaccarino praised the deal, saying, “The future could not be brighter.”

Analyst Paolo Pescatore, founder of PP Foresight, called it a logical move given the rising demand for AI, data centers, and computing power.

Musk’s Growing Influence in AI and Government

Elon Musk founded xAI in 2023 as a competitor to OpenAI. The startup recently secured $6 billion in funding, bringing its valuation to $40 billion. Meanwhile, Musk’s 2022 purchase of Twitter for $44 billion led to aggressive cost-cutting and reduced content moderation, causing a drop in ad revenue. However, Musk has since been using X to promote xAI’s chatbot, Grok, which is trained on data from X users.

Beyond tech, Musk has also become more involved in politics. After donating nearly $300 million to Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign and other Republican causes, he was appointed head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). In this role, he is focused on cutting government jobs, reducing spending, and rolling back regulations – policies that could benefit his business empire.

X Becomes the Hub for Trump’s Administration

With Trump back in the White House and Musk now holding a key government position, X has become the main platform for updates on the administration. Musk has also been using X to share details about his work at the Department of Government Efficiency, further increasing the platform’s political influence.

As Musk continues to merge his business and political interests, this latest acquisition signals a future where AI and social media are more connected than ever.

The company argues that its event contracts function as financial instruments rather than gambling products. Regulators issued cease and desist orders, but Kalshi insists its contracts fall under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) jurisdiction. The legal battle raises questions about the future of event-based trading in the U.S. As the lawsuit unfolds, the outcome could set a precedent for financial innovation in prediction markets.

Kalshi Challenges State-Level Restrictions

Kalshi, a prediction market platform, has filed a lawsuit against the Nevada Gaming Control Board and the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement. The lawsuit follows cease and desist orders from state regulators, instructing Kalshi to halt all sports-related contracts in their jurisdictions.

According to Kalshi’s legal team, these contracts fall under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) oversight and should not be subject to state-level regulations. Kalshi argues that its event contracts function as two-sided markets, trading as swaps rather than traditional sports betting. This distinction, the company claims, removes them from the scope of gaming laws.

Tarek Mansour, co-founder of Kalshi, emphasized the company’s commitment to defending its business model. “Prediction markets are a critical innovation of the 21st century, and like all innovations, they are initially misunderstood. We are proud to be the company that has pioneered this technology and stand ready to defend it once again in a court of law,” Mansour stated.

Legal Disputes Over Election Contracts

The Nevada Gaming Control Board also issued a cease and desist order against Kalshi’s election contracts. However, in September 2024, a U.S. judge ruled that these contracts were legal, allowing them to be traded in the U.S. despite state-level pushback.

Kalshi maintains that its election and sports contracts provide traders with a hedge against market risks rather than serving as gambling products. The company argues that these contracts offer financial risk management tools similar to those used in commodities and futures trading.

CFTC’s Shift in Regulatory Approach

On February 4, acting CFTC director Caroline Pham announced a shift in the agency’s regulatory approach. Instead of enforcing restrictions through lawsuits, the CFTC will now prioritize protecting victims of fraud and addressing legal violations.

“The CFTC is strengthening its enforcement program to focus on victims of fraud, as well as remaining vigilant for other violations of law,” Pham stated.

Market participants welcomed this regulatory change because they previously experienced several enforcement actions during past regulatory policies. The CFTC made its announcement at the same time it launched an investgation of Super Bowl event contracts provided by Kalshi and Crypto.com as reported by the Bloomberg. These contracts received regulatory examination from the regulator, who found no violations of U.S. derivatives laws and thus refrained from banning their use.

Future of Prediction Markets Amid Legal Scrutiny

The court dispute between Kalshi and state regulators creates extensive considerations regarding the prediction markets’ position in U.S. markets. Financial product innovations force Kalshi and other platforms to push the boundaries of gambling regulations alongside trading conventions.

The regulatory confusion between betting products and financial instruments can be resolved by creating specific distinctions between them, according to industry experts. The result of Kalshi’s lawsuit will determine the operating framework for prediction markets within the U.S. financial sector.

Market observers, along with regulatory authorities, will actively follow the case’s progress to decide if Kalshi’s contracts qualify as trading instruments or must continue subject to gambling restrictions.",techmeme

The cease-and-desist letters called for Kalshi to stop all sports-related contracts within the respective states, citing unauthorized sports wagering operations.

Kalshi argues that its event contracts, by which users are able to wager on the result of different events, are covered by the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and hence are beyond the reach of states.

Kalshi lawsuit against Nevada Gaming Control Board

The company emphasizes that its platform operates as a two-sided market where participants trade contracts with one another, differing fundamentally from traditional sports betting models where the house sets odds and takes bets.

Kalshi’s co-founder, Tarek Mansour, stated, “Prediction markets are a critical innovation of the 21st century, and like all innovations, they are initially misunderstood. We are proud to be the company that has pioneered this technology and stand ready to defend it once again in a court of law.” ​

The NGCB’s cease-and-desist order also targeted Kalshi’s election-related contracts. However, a U.S. judge ruled in September 2024 that these contracts were legal, permitting them to trade freely across the United States. ​

On Feb. 4, acting CFTC director Caroline Pham announced a regulatory shift, ending enforcement-driven regulation to focus on fraud prevention.

Pham stated the agency would prioritize protecting fraud victims while monitoring other legal violations. Industry firms welcomed the move after a wave of regulatory actions under the Biden administration.

That same day, the CFTC launched a probe into Super Bowl event contracts by Kalshi and Crypto.com to assess compliance with U.S. derivatives laws. The agency ultimately took no action against the contracts.",techmeme

The company has gathered $11.4 billion in cash to distribute to thousands of parties affected by its 2022 bankruptcy, with the first payments to major creditors set for May 30.

These include institutional investors and firms that held crypto on FTX’s platform. Smaller creditors with claims below the $50,000 mark have already begun receiving distributions.

FTX’s collapse left a financial crater and a trail of frustrated creditors—many of whom expected to be repaid in crypto, not dollars. Since the bankruptcy, the price of bitcoin has more than quadrupled, intensifying frustrations among those waiting for their assets back.

The task of unwinding FTX’s balance sheet has been slowed by a large number of claims, many of them reportedly questionable. Andrew Dietderich, a bankruptcy attorney for the firm, told the court that FTX has received “27 quintillion” claims, Blloomberg reported, many of which are duplicates or outright fraudulent.

Interest payments are compounding the urgency. While FTX earns only a modest return on its cash, legitimate creditors are entitled to 9% interest annually on unpaid claims. The longer it takes to pay, the more the company could owe.

The main creditors include investors owed millions of dollars, as well as institutions that had stored cryptocurrency on the FTX platform.

A Long Line of Creditors Waiting for Payouts

FTX’s sudden downfall in 2022 left thousands of creditors in limbo. While quick settlements would help recover the most value, the process has been slowed by the enormous number of claims filed after the exchange’s collapse.

Adding to the frustration, Bitcoin’s value has surged more than four times since FTX went bankrupt. Many former customers had hoped to be repaid in digital assets instead of cash, as their holdings would have been worth much more today.

27 Quintillion Claims?

Paying creditors is further complicated by a flood of questionable claims. Dietderich explained that some claims might violate “know your customer” (KYC) regulations, which require FTX to verify creditor identities. Others may not be valid at all, making the process even more time-consuming.

A particularly shocking detail is that FTX is dealing with a total of “27 quintillion” claims. A quintillion is a 1 followed by 18 zeros—one billion times a billion. In bankruptcy cases, lawyers typically eliminate duplicate, exaggerated, and false claims before making payments. According to Dietderich, FTX is facing billions of these flawed claims.

The Pressure to Pay Quickly

FTX is under pressure to repay creditors as soon as possible. The company is earning less interest on the $11.4 billion it holds than the 9% interest rate creditors are accumulating while waiting for their money. The longer the process drags on, the more costly it becomes.

FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022 after its crypto platform shut down and was handed over to insolvency experts. A court approved its payout plan in October 2023, allowing the repayment process to move forward.

SEC Nominee Questioned Over FTX Ties

Meanwhile, FTX’s collapse continues to have ripple effects in Washington. Lawmakers recently questioned Paul Atkins, a potential nominee for SEC Chair, about his connections to the failed exchange.

Atkins is involved with Patomak Global Partners, a firm FTX hired as an adviser in 2022. Senator Elizabeth Warren raised concerns about a possible conflict of interest if Atkins becomes SEC Chair, given his firm’s past ties to FTX. Lawmakers also criticized former SEC Chair Gary Gensler for his approach to crypto regulation during his time in office.

With repayments now in sight, creditors finally have a timeline for getting their money back. However, the process of sorting through claims and resolving legal hurdles will continue to be a complex challenge.

Microsoft has made the process slightly more complicated, as Windows 11 now requires you to create a Registry entry before you can bypass the Microsoft account requirement.

Windows 11 has always required you to use a Microsoft account, similar to how it’s mandatory to use an Apple account on iOS and a Google account on Android. However, unlike its competitors, Microsoft has allowed users to bypass this mandatory requirement and use the operating system with a local account.

You could bypass the Microsoft account requirement by disconnecting the internet or using dummy emails like [email protected], but before you could pull that off, you need to open Command Prompt using Shift + F10.

This step is required when you’re stuck at the “Let’s add your Microsoft account” screen.

In Command Prompt, you need to type oobe\bypassnro and hit enter. Then, Windows Setup will refresh, and Microsoft won’t force you to link your account. At this point, you’re eligible to finish setting up Windows with a local account.

What has changed in newer preview builds?

Starting with Build 26200.5516, which is believed to be the build series testing the platform changes for Windows 11 25H2, Microsoft has removed bypassnro.cmd to improve “security and user experience of Windows 11.”

“Removes script from the build to enhance security and user experience of Windows 11. This change ensures that all users exit setup with internet connectivity and a Microsoft Account,” Microsoft noted in a blog post.

Does it mean it’s impossible to set up Windows 11 without a Microsoft account now? No, the bypass still works, but you’re now required to create a Registry before you can use it.

In our tests, Windows Latest installed the preview update, then we tried running the script OOBE\BYPASSNRO via Command Prompt, and it didn’t work (as expected).

The installation rebooted, and I was at the “Unlock your Microsoft experience” screen, which has a sign-in button that brings back the “Let’s add your Microsoft account” page.

You can STILL bypass Microsoft account requirement

But here’s the good news – Microsoft has only removed the bypassnro.cmd script, the bypass itself still exists.

This means you can still manually bypass the network requirement during Windows 11 setup using the Registry Editor. You just need to create a new Registry value by following these steps. I tested on my PC:

On the “Let’s connect you to a network” screen, press Shift + F10 to open Command Prompt. Type regedit to open the Registry Editor. In Registry Editor, navigate to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\OOBE Right-click on the blank space in the right panel and select:

New > DWORD (32-bit) Value Name it exactly: BypassNRO Double-click BypassNRO, and set the value data to 1. Close Registry Editor. Restart.

If that’s too much for you, you can just open Command Prompt and run the following script:

reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\OOBE"" /v BypassNRO /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f

If you followed the steps correctly, you will see the “I don’t have internet” option again, as it did when you used the old Command Prompt script method.

Windows installation will finally proceed without a Microsoft account.

As shown in the above screenshot, you can finally finish setting up Windows with a local account.

Based on our testing, we can confirm Microsoft has only removed the automatic script. It’s also pretty obvious from the company’s statement, which clearly mentions “removes script from the build.”

In future Windows releases, you’ll be required create the Registry and continue using PC without MSA.",techmeme
https://techmeme.com,Microsoft eliminates workaround that circumvents Microsoft account requirement during Windows 11 installation,https://www.tomshardware.com/software/windows/microsoft-eliminates-workaround-that-circumvents-microsoft-account-requirement-during-windows-11-installation,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 16:20:36 GMT","The Windows 11 installer is being tightened to force more users to set up the OS with a Microsoft Account. An official blog post accompanying the latest Insider Preview Build 26200.5516 stated that “we’re removing the bypassnro.cmd script.” The reasoning behind this change, according to Microsoft, is that insisting on a Microsoft Account will enhance Windows 11 security and the user experience. However, all is not lost - offline account devotees - as a rather lengthy regedit command can re-enable bypassnro.cmd.

Last June, we reported that Microsoft had neutered a popular forced online account setup process workaround, which was as simple as inputting an invalid/blocked email account. The change did not phase us; it remained relatively quick and straightforward to sidestep Microsoft’s pushy requirement for signing in or creating an online account. Thus, hitting Shift + F10 and then typing OOBE/BYPASSNRO when facing this install issue became popular among some PC users. This era will end if and when this preview build update reaches mainstream release.

From Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 26200.5516, hitting Shift + F10 and then typing OOBE/BYPASSNRO results in an error message stating the command isn’t recognized. So, this functionality needs to be restored to the Out of Box Experience (OOBE) by adding it to the correct section of the registry.

reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\OOBE /v BypassNRO /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /fshutdown /r /t 0 https://t.co/NuDzQTIFuGMarch 28, 2025

Tech enthusiast Bob Pony replied to PhantomOfEarth’s Tweet, highlighting the change with a command to re-enable bypassnro.cmd on a fresh Windows 11 install. When faced with the Microsoft Account sign-in screen, users need to open a command prompt (Shift + F10) and type:

reg add “HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\OOBE” /v BypassNRO /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f shutdown /r /t 0

On restart, the Shift + F10 and typing OOBE/BYPASSNRO trick will again work its magic. By this, we mean you will restart again and be able to finalize the installation offline and without a Microsoft Account.

If we learn from history, as we should, it is reasonable to expect that Microsoft will make more changes to close down this updated OOBE workaround. Perhaps it will take another six to twelve months, but for those wishing to swerve Microsoft Account requirements with fresh Windows 11 installs, using one of the bootable flash drive utilities like Rufus to make a no-hassle installer from the latest Microsoft Windows ISO file is probably worthwhile.

Installing friction-reducing tools is even more attractive for those who play around with hardware and often re-install Windows. Other users who might wish to install Windows without their personal Microsoft Account include small-time resellers or refurbishers who want to ship a verified working Windows 11 install with all the drivers set up, etc.",techmeme

However, people found a quick hack that allowed users to set up Windows 11 without a Microsoft account. You could just launch Command Prompt during the setup process and run “oobe\bypassnro” to skip the online account requirement.

Now, Microsoft on its Windows Insider blog has mentioned that the company is removing the bypassnro.cmd script that allowed users to skip the Microsoft account requirement during the installation process.

Microsoft notes, “We’re removing the bypassnro.cmd script from the build to enhance security and user experience of Windows 11. This change ensures that all users exit setup with internet connectivity and a Microsoft Account.“

Currently, the update is rolling out to Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 26200.5516 in the Dev channel. However, it’s quite likely that Microsoft will apply the change to all builds including the stable channel. So in the future, you won’t be able to bypass the Microsoft account requirement during Windows 11 setup.

Having said that, there is still a way to bypass the Microsoft account requirement using bypassnro. Windows watcher @phantomofearth has shared on X that only the script has been removed. You can open Regedit and manually add the BypassNRO DWORD to skip the online account requirement, just like before.

By the way, you can also use Rufus to bypass Windows 11 hardware requirements including the Microsoft account requirement, by following our guide.",techmeme

OpenAI's $40 billion funding round with SoftBank appears to be nearing completion, according to the Wall Street Journal. However, there's a significant condition: OpenAI must successfully transform into a for-profit company by the end of the year. If this doesn't happen, the funding could drop to $20 billion.

SoftBank plans to contribute $30 billion directly while raising an additional $10 billion from other investors, including Microsoft. The initial phase would provide OpenAI with $10 billion. Meanwhile, Elon Musk is actively working to prevent the for-profit conversion.

SoftBank bets big on OpenAI with $3 billion annual commitment and new joint venture

SoftBank and OpenAI announced a major partnership on Monday that includes billions in annual spending and a new joint venture focused on the Japanese market.

The deal commits SoftBank to spending $3 billion per year on OpenAI technologies across its own operations and subsidiaries. The two companies will also create ""SB OpenAI Japan,"" a joint venture that will exclusively distribute OpenAI's enterprise technology to major Japanese companies.

The agreement gives SoftBank and its subsidiaries access to ChatGPT Enterprise, the OpenAI API, and custom models. SoftBank is packaging these tools, along with the AI agent ""Operator"" and ""Deep Research"" tool, under its new ""Cristal Intelligence"" brand.

Masayoshi Son sees AGI in less than 10 years

During a Monday morning livestream, SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son shared his thoughts on AI's future, suggesting artificial general intelligence (AGI) could emerge within the next decade. Son noted that large companies would likely be the first to adopt AGI due to the significant costs involved.

The partnership extends to Arm, the British chip designer SoftBank acquired in 2016, which plans to use OpenAI tools to enhance its productivity.

Recent reports suggest SoftBank is considering an investment of $15 to $25 billion in OpenAI, which would make it the largest investor alongside Microsoft. This investment would be part of a financing round worth up to $40 billion, potentially valuing OpenAI at $300 billion. Some of this funding may support the Stargate project.

https://techmeme.com,OpenAI’s $20B Payout Clause Signals Investor Pressure Behind Soaring Valuation,https://winbuzzer.com/2025/03/29/openais-20b-payout-clause-signals-investor-pressure-behind-soaring-valuation-xcxwbn/,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","A clause buried in OpenAI’s latest funding effort has shifted attention away from its lofty $80 billion valuation and toward a less publicized financial obligation.

The company’s ongoing SoftBank-led funding round includes a plan to return up to $20 billion to early investors and employees—a massive redemption program that intensifies pressure on OpenAI to complete its transition to a for-profit structure.

Behind the Valuation: A Redemption-Driven Restructuring

The deal, which emerged through internal communications and subsequent reporting, was not publicly disclosed at launch. According to Reuters, OpenAI must finalize its transition into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) by the end of the year to access the full $40 billion funding. Failure to do so could reduce the available funds by half.

While OpenAI presents the PBC model as a way to balance public benefit with investor return, internal friction around this shift has been mounting.

The $40 billion round, led by SoftBank and including backers such as Magnetar Capital and Founders Fund, would push the company’s valuation toward $300 billion—roughly double its prior level. However, the $20 billion redemption plan is larger than previously disclosed, adding urgency to the corporate restructuring effort.

Musk Lawsuit and Organizational Realignment

OpenAI’s shift has triggered legal challenges. Elon Musk, a co-founder of the company, pursues a lawsuit claiming the transition to a for-profit entity violates its founding principles. A U.S. judge denied Musk’s request to block the restructuring, but allowed the case to proceed on an expedited timeline.

Meanwhile, leadership at OpenAI is changing. CEO Sam Altman is narrowing his focus to technical direction. Brad Lightcap now oversees global operations and partnerships. Former Mark Chen steps in as Chief Research Officer, with Julia Villagra taking over as Chief People Officer.

SoftBank’s Backing and the Stargate Infrastructure Strategy

OpenAI’s SoftBank investment is tightly tied to the Stargate Project, a Trump-endorsed $500 billion infrastructure initiative aimed at building U.S.-based AI data centers, chip fabrication facilities, and research hubs. The first $100 billion phase will be located in Texas, with OpenAI poised to play a central role.

Chief Global Affairs Officer Chris Lehane has been lobbying for policies aligned with OpenAI’s strategy. In meetings with the Trump administration, Lehane advocated for a light regulatory approach, warning that fragmented state-level policies could weaken the country’s position.

CoreWeave Deal Marks Break from Microsoft

OpenAI has also moved to reduce its reliance on Microsoft Azure. When Microsoft opted not to renew a $12 billion agreement with GPU cloud provider CoreWeave, OpenAI stepped in, finalizing an $11.9 billion contract for five years of compute access. The company also took a $350 million equity stake in CoreWeave ahead of its IPO.

In parallel, OpenAI is collaborating with Broadcom and TSMC to develop custom AI chips, with the first design to be expected this year. These efforts signal a longer-term strategy to manage compute costs and infrastructure at scale, critical to supporting future generations of large language models and multimodal systems.

Legal Peril from the New York Times

Menwhile, a federal judge recently ruled that The New York Times’ copyright lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft may proceed. The paper alleges that OpenAI used millions of its articles without permission to train models like ChatGPT. NYT attorneys argue this practice harms both traffic and revenue by replicating original journalism.

OpenAI maintains that its models do not replicate entire articles, but instead tokenize input data to generate responses.

While OpenAI has signed content licensing deals with TIME, Vox Media, and the Financial Times, its promised “Media Manager” tool—which would let publishers opt out of training datasets—remains delayed. Smaller media outlets have voiced frustration at the lag.

Product Rollouts Sustain Market Momentum

Despite structural and legal turbulence, OpenAI continues to release features that support its high valuation. The company recently added GPT-4o’s image generation and editing capabilities to ChatGPT, allowing users—including those on the free tier—to generate, refine, and customize visuals within a chat session. The model now supports inpainting, photorealistic rendering, and iterative image transformation.

Shortly before that, OpenAI launched updates to its speech-to-text and text-to-speech models. These enhancements reduce transcription hallucinations and introduce more expressive, human-like voice options. Developers can now adjust tone and pacing using nine preset voice styles. The upgrades place OpenAI in closer competition with firms like Sesame AI, whose ultra-realistic voice synthesis has triggered ethical debates.

Navigating Toward a Profit-Driven Future

OpenAI’s latest moves reflect a company undergoing dramatic change. Its technical advances remain impressive, but they’re now intertwined with a restructuring effort designed to satisfy investors and reduce dependence on legacy partners like Microsoft. The $20 billion redemption clause is more than just a payout vehicle—it reveals the growing influence of capital on OpenAI’s direction.

As it continues its for-profit transformation, OpenAI faces simultaneous challenges: meeting investor expectations, defending its data practices, scaling its infrastructure, and staying ahead in the AI arms race. Whether it can balance these demands while maintaining its original mission—to ensure AI benefits humanity—remains one of the defining questions for the future of the sector.",techmeme

The federal banking regulator rescinded a previous rule requiring supervised banks to send notifications if they wanted to get involved in digital assets.

Now, the FDIC says its member institutions can conduct crypto activities as long as they “adequately manage the associated risks.”

FDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill says the change represents the regulator “turning the page on the flawed approach of the past three years.”

“I expect this to be one of several steps the FDIC will take to lay out a new approach for how banks can engage in crypto- and blockchain-related activities in accordance with safety and soundness standards.”

Numerous crypto stakeholders in recent years accused the FDIC of facilitating “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” an alleged attempt by Biden Administration government regulators to stifle the digital asset industry.

Coinbase, for example, has been using the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to uncover instances of the FDIC asking banks to freeze crypto services, known as “pause letters.”

Last month, the FDIC released redacted documents related to its supervision of crypto-related activities, which include pause letters sent to 24 banks.

FDIC now allows banks to engage in crypto activities without seeking prior approval, provided they manage associated risks.

This policy reversal aims to foster innovation while mitigating its associated risks.

The move marks a significant departure from the previous administrations strict approach.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued updated guidance on its supervisory expectations for state-chartered institutions seeking to engage with or interact with the cryptocurrency space. Eligible crypto-related activities can now be performed without any advance FDIC approval, as long as FDIC-supervised institutions effectively mitigate the applicable risk.

A New Path: Shunning the “Flawed Approach”

This move, cemented by Financial Institution Letter (FIL-7-2025), rescinds the earlier FIL-16-2022, which required banks to notify the FDIC of any crypto-ventures prior to doing so. Acting Chairman Travis Hill said that the FDIC is “turning the page on the flawed approach of the last three years” and that additional actions will follow to clarify how banks can safely engage in crypto and blockchain activities. He also emphasized that future regulatory updates will focus on enhancing security measures and ensuring compliance with evolving financial laws, preventing potential misuse of digital assets.

Hill has criticized the FDIC’s previous treatment of crypto, saying the agency sent more than 20 letters to banks asking them to stop or postpone crypto-related activities without any formal rule-making process. Since then, he has advocated for a reassessment of BSA enforcement across financial institutions, emphasizing that compliance with the BSA should not serve as an implicit excuse for restricting banking access.

The OCC All Over Again? A Coalition on Crypto Regulation?

This step aligns with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) — which recently reiterated that national banks and federal savings associations are permitted to conduct crypto-asset custody, stablecoin activities and join independent node verification networks. When the announcement was made, Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood said OCC expects banks to apply the same risk management controls to crypto as with traditional activity, adding that this shift reduces the regulatory burden on banks engaging in crypto activities.

This change suggests a coordinated effort among regulatory agencies to offer an improved, more streamlined framework for crypto-related activities in the banking sector.

Industry Responds with Relief, Caution

This policy change has been welcomed by those in the industry. Rob Nichols, president and CEO of the American Bankers Association welcomed the new guidance from the FDIC, which permits supervised entities to undertake certain crypto-affiliated business without seeking prior FDIC approval, a notable shift from previous requirements. He further noted that America’s banks were actively seeking to meet the challenge in a safe and responsible manner through the ecosystem of financial services and labeled the regulatory clarity that was necessary to foster that innovation as critical.

Other observers are more cautious. The next financial crash, warned Justin Rosario, could be severe. Likewise, bank adviser Donald F. Billings mocked the policy’s vagueness, suggesting the risk management requirements could be too weak.

De-risking in Crypto through Focused Compliance Continued

The FDIC still wants banks to manage the risks behind crypto with market volatility, liquidity issues, operational and cyber threats, consumer protection requirements, and anti-money laundering (AML) concerns. The agency recommends that institutions work closely with their supervisory teams during the process. This signals that not only is the door open — but that it will come with clear expectations of responsible behavior.

The FDIC’s decision could unlock significant capital in the cryptocurrency sector, as banks reassess whether they can support digital asset firms and provide crypto services. Such a move could help bring digital parts further into the fold of traditional banking, significantly changing the trajectory of finance as we know it.

https://theverge.com,I’m still testing the new Razer Blade 16 and I have mixed feelings,https://theverge.com/tech/638930/razer-blade-16-2025-rtx-5090-gaming-laptop-impressions-price,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 13:00:00 GMT","is a reviewer covering laptops and the occasional gadget. He spent over 15 years in the photography industry before joining The Verge as a deals writer in 2021.

The Razer Blade 16 is designed to be the gaming-focused alternative to the MacBook Pro, and I’m always here for that. I love a gaming laptop that still looks and feels like a somewhat normal laptop, and the new Blade returns to a thinner and lighter chassis design after the last-gen got a bit chunky. The top-end configuration also adopts the new flagship Nvidia RTX 5090 laptop GPU and an even heftier price of $4,499.99 ($200 more than the 4090 model).

I’ve spent some time with the new Razer Blade 16, but my first review unit had noticeable hardware issues and was replaced by Nvidia, which provided the Blades for RTX 5090 testing. I’ve only had the replacement unit for a few days, and while it doesn’t exhibit any of the same performance issues or buzzy speakers, it’s had a couple of random bluescreens of its own. I’m in troubleshooting talks with Razer, but while that’s ongoing, I’m still testing this laptop and sizing up my feelings about it. Consider this me posting through it — a little glimpse into my internal dialog. (You’re welcome. But also, I’m sorry?)

Unlike a MacBook Pro, the Blade 16’s black is actually black. Like a MacBook Pro, it’s quite the fingerprint magnet (but it cleans up well).

I love most of the hardware on the new Blade — most. Its 16-inch, 2560 x 1600 OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate remains a lovely panel to work and play on, just like its predecessor. And the keyboard and trackpad are overall very good. My biggest gripe with the keyboard is the new column of macro keys on the right, which often causes me to mute the microphone when I mean to hit the right arrow. It’s yet another problem that could have been avoided by using the standard inverted-T arrow key arrangement that’s easier to find by feel. Are Windows laptop makers ever going to learn?

The thinner and lighter chassis is a welcome change (it shaves off a whole 7mm and 0.8 pounds), though I need to do more thermal testing to see if it’s as good at cooling as the last model. There’s also Razer’s Laptop Cooling Pad, which can give the Blade 16’s GPU and CPU up to 25W more power each. I have it here, so I’ll see if HyperBoost is worth the added noise and extra $150. I also wonder whether thicker gaming laptops might eke out more juice from the RTX 5090.

The new Razer Blade 16 (right) is noticeably thinner than the last-gen 4090 model (left). The keyboard deck is slightly deeper on the new model (right). The new Blade 16 thankfully maintains the same plethora of ports. I know we’re only talking a difference in thickness of just 7mm, but you definitely feel it.

As I’ve already written, the RTX 5090 GPU in the Blade 16 is a fine upgrade if you enjoy DLSS and frame generation. I’m going to continue testing it, including more gaming while on battery power. Nvidia’s made some big claims about how powerful yet power-efficient the 50-series laptop cards are, and in my early testing, the 5090 is about 20 percent more efficient than the 4090, so I’m intrigued.

But I’m skeptical, because when I’m not gaming, the Blade 16 struggles to get through a basic work day on battery, even while using productivity apps like Slack, Chrome, and Google Docs on the integrated graphics. Its AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 “Strix Point” CPU can easily stretch beyond eight hours of work in other gaming laptops, like the 2024 Asus ROG Zephyrus G16, but I can’t get five and a half hours with the Blade, despite enabling Advanced Optimus and triple-checking the graphics settings in Nvidia Control Panel, Windows Settings, and Synapse. (Maybe there’s something misconfigured somewhere, so I’ll continue testing this too.)

This laptop is supposed to be great for productivity, creative apps, and gaming. It costs four-and-a-half thousand dollars. Part of me really likes what it has to offer, and I’m downright impressed with how cool it can run under load, but another part of me thinks the price is outlandish if things are randomly crashing under light loads and you have to charge multiple times a day. For that money, you can buy a $2,000 MacBook Pro that can handle creative workflows and last well over a whole day (if you don’t mind MacOS, of course). And you’d have another $2,500 to spend on a respectable gaming laptop, or even a more powerful desktop.

Green-illuminated lid logo aside, the Blades continue to look sleek and fit in anywhere.

However, I’ll concede that having one device to do it all is a slick proposition. I keep coming back to how nice this laptop looks and feels. And boy does it make games look pretty and run them smoothly, either on its brilliant OLED or on an external 4K monitor. It is, after all, meant for games.

I can still see myself loving the Blade 16. But we’ll have to see in the full review, after a whole bunch more testing that’s hopefully (fingers crossed) devoid of any further technical hangups.

What do you think? Does any laptop actually make sense for nearly five grand? Let me know in the comments, and if there’s anything in particular you’d like to see tested on the Blade 16 for the full review.",theverge
https://theverge.com,BougeRV’s telescopic lantern is ridiculously versatile,https://theverge.com/reviews/638090/bougerv-flextail-telescopic-lantern-review-price,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 06:11:08 GMT","is a deputy editor and Verge co-founder with a passion for human-centric cities, e-bikes, and life as a digital nomad. He’s been a tech journalist for almost 20 years.

It’s sold as an outdoor camplight, but BougeRV’s very bright LED lantern is really a multifunctional work lamp for any place that needs an extra dose of lighting. It’s rechargeable and compact enough to serve as a long-lasting flashlight with three swiveling LED panels that can direct 3000 lumens onto your table, campsite, workspace, or engine block from a height of more than five feet thanks to its telescoping aluminum pole.

I’ve found it impressively versatile and useful over the last week of testing at home, at the beach, or tooling around in my camper van. It provides warm or cold light exactly where I need it, with three levels of brightness ranging from dim to supernova.

At $109.99, the BougeRV Outdoor Portable Telescopic Camping Lantern is also more capable than many of its more expensive competitors. There’s a lot to like here.

At the heart of this lantern is a 57.7Wh battery that can power the lamp on its lowest setting for up to 60 hours, or about three hours when all three LED strips are set to max brightness. You can power it off USB-C from a separate external battery or wall jack if you need more time.

The lantern is built around the number three. There are three retractable legs that can be secured with three included pegs to serve as a sturdy base for the three LED panels raised up to 64.57 inches (164 cm) off the ground. You can independently turn on one, two, or three of the LED panels set to three intensifying brightness levels via the cluster of three buttons on the top of the unit.

There is, however, just one lamp for the flashlight, one hook on the bottom, and one slider switch to prevent the light from accidentally turning on. There’s also one USB-C jack that both charges the lantern in about four hours and charges your gadgets at up to 22.5 watts.

At first, the articulating segments that rotate, fold, and slide can be a bit much. But I soon mastered the buttons and movements needed to retract and expand the lantern into the illuminated origami of my choosing. In general, the aluminum and plastic assembly feels robust enough, but I wonder how those extended light arms will hold up after a few falls, especially when the aluminum pole is fully extended. It is IP54 rated so it should prove immune to rain showers and dust.

The framerate counters over at Digital Foundry looked into reports of noticeable stutters every eight seconds for games like Elden Ring and Spider-Man Remastered while using variable refresh rate, testing 19 games with a number of displays and comparing to Xbox versions where available.

Some games they tested (Gran Turismo 7, God of War Ragnarok) didn’t have the problem, and while it’s unclear why it is happening, it does seem to be PS5-specific, and sometimes takes 20 minutes or more to show up.",theverge
https://theverge.com,Digital Foundry confirmed: PlayStation 5 and PS5 Pro have prevalent VRR stuttering problems,https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-confirmed-playstation-5-and-ps5-pro-have-vrr-stuttering-problems,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 15:00:00 GMT","We've received a continuous stream of reports over the last few months suggesting there's a problem with PlayStation 5: VRR support has an issue where game performance can be interrupted by a continuous, obvious stutter that manifests every eight seconds. Various theories have been shared and discussed online, covering a range of displays and firmwares but after spending some time investigating the problem, we can confirm it is a real problem, impacting both PS5 and Pro consoles - and based on our tests, it will impact any VRR-compatible display.

To fully understand the issue, it's important to explain how VRR - variable refresh rate - works in general and more specifically on PlayStation consoles. Until VRR arrived, the most stable performance in console games was to see frame-rate locked to 60fps or 30fps. An even delivery of frames is sent to the display, synchronising with the refresh rate of the panel. At 60fps, a new frame is displayed with each new refresh of the screen. At 30fps, a new frame persists for two refreshes. As the name suggests, VRR operates with a variable refresh rate. Instead of the console needing to synchronise with the display update, the console itself is in charge of when the refresh happens - typically whenever a new frame is ready to be presented.

With VRR, a game doesn't need to run locked to 60fps or 30fps to present to gamers in a consistent manner - as long as frame-rates remain broadly similar, gameplay still looks smooth, even if a game is operating in, for example, a variable 50-60fps or 100-120fps 'window'. It's a boon to players and can even be considered a 'fix' of sorts to variable frame-rates, reducing stutter considerably and removing screen-tearing completely in titles that exhibit it.

So, what's the problem with PlayStation? The most obvious example of the stuttering issue presenting itself occurs in titles that support 120Hz VRR with unlocked frame-rates - games like The Last of Us Part 1 and 2, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and Diablo 4, for example. What happens is that gameplay works just fine for around 20 minutes, but at some point soon after that, a noticeable stutter manifests every eight seconds, give or take a few frames. The point of VRR is to bring consistency to variable frame-rates and the 'magic' is lost when the game stutters so noticeably in so regular a cadence.

Oliver Mackenzie and Alex Battaglia share their impressions on the much-discussed PS5 VRR issue. In this video, you'll see how the problem manifests and our methodology in isolating the issue.Watch on YouTube

If you have a VRR-compatible panel, you may have access to a refresh rate monitor. Disregarding more complex elements of VRR not relevant to the discussion (low frame-rate compensation, etc), these read-outs tell you how often the console is driving the display to update itself with a new frame. It's the closest you'll get to a console equivalent to a PC-style frame-rate meter. Thanks to the inclusion of these meters, we've noted that the stuttering causes the refresh rate counter to momentarily spike up to 120Hz in the most obviously affected titles. So, in a game like Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 on PS5 Pro, for example, we can see frame-rates in the 60-70fps range thanks to the onscreen display - and when a stutter kicks in, there's that telltale, momentary jump to 120Hz.

Since refresh rate monitors are so common across so many different TVs and monitors - with the same 120Hz 'tell' occurring on all tested screens, we are able to discount some of the reasons suggested for PS5/Pro VRR stutter. There's been the suggestion that the problem is limited to LG OLED TVs, or TVs based on LG OLED panels. Others believe the problem only kicked in after a non-specified LG OLED firmware update. However, we've tested a Samsung mini-LED display, an LG OLED TV, an LG OLED PC monitor with HDMI 2.1 VRR support and even an Eve Spectrum monitor. All have refresh rate meters, all exhibit stutter and all show momentary spikes to 120Hz when a stutter kicks in. At this point, all evidence indicates that it is not the display that is the source of the problem, but rather PlayStation 5 and PS5 Pro consoles. The spike to 120Hz does suggest that the console is dropping out of VRR 'in the moment' and returning to a fixed refresh rate, causing the stutter.

At this point we should stress that this is a Sony-specific issue only. Xbox VRR remains robust and in multi-platform games that exhibit the problem on PlayStation, the Microsoft console works just fine.

Quite why this is happening is unclear. We've tested a total of 19 games now, finding that many games have the problem, while others seemingly do not. The evidence suggests that if the output frame-rate of the console does not vary so much, the stutter is less likely to happen. We can see the impact of the problem easily in Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered for example, but it's far more difficult to see if it's a problem in Marvel's Spider-Man 2, running on the same engine and likely using the same Sony libraries.

While developers have to actively support VRR, especially to support 120Hz VRR, Sony offers a back-up solution for existing games with no support. This support is at the system level, activated within the PlayStation's front-end. It is limited to 60Hz and only allows VRR to work within a 48Hz to 60Hz 'window'. Reports that Elden Ring has a similar 20 minutes of smooth play followed by a stutter every eight seconds are confirmed. So, the evidence points away from this being a problem introduced by game developers and points more towards an issue with how PS5 and PS5 Pro output a VRR signal.

Of the 19 games we tested, this table shows games where we can categorically confirm there is a problem and conversely, titles where VRR works just as it should. Our general test methodology was to load a game, go away and do other things, then return 30 to 60 minutes later to check for stutter. Of course, it may well be the case that titles that are unaffected may simply require more time before the issue kicks in - but the point is that we can confirm there is a problem that Sony needs to fix.

Confirmed Affected Games Confirmed Unaffected Games* Diablo 4 Dragon's Dogma 2 Elden Ring Immortals of Aveum Hogwarts Legacy God of War Ragnarok The Last of Us Part 1 Gran Turismo 7 The Last of Us Part 2 Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered Metaphor Refantazio Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart

* Unaffected within the scope of our testing - other factors may cause the issue to manifest

Looking at the table, it's difficult to find any common link between games that exhibit the issue and those that don't. It's not a third-party developer problem as Sony games can be impacted. It's not an engine problem as games running on the same underlying technology can sit in either category - Resident Evil 4 and Dragon's Dogma 2 both use the RE Engine, for example. However, the inclusion of Elden Ring would suggest that it's more likely a system-level issue: FromSoftware released that game before VRR was even supported, meaning that the PS5's system software is handling all aspects of that game's VRR presentation.

The only other common factors we have are that many games that support completely unlocked - and therefore more variable - frame-rates have the problem when VRR is active. In game modes where there is less variability, the problem is less likely to present. Titles that run consistently well at 120fps, 60fps, 30fps or even 40fps with VRR enabled seem to work fine.

That said, where the issue does obviously manifest, clearly this is a big issue - the whole point of VRR is to 'smooth out' games where frame-rate is variable, so in that respect, the stuttering is clearly a problem. First of all, you can simply disable VRR in the system software menu and play with a standard fixed refresh rate. Thankfully, that's not exactly a major problem on most of the affected games we've found. The only other workable solution is to restart the game every so often when the issue emerges. Obviously, this is not ideal. We've informed Sony of all of our findings and would hope to see this addressed. We'll report back on this in due course.",theverge

https://theverge.com,The base iPad is finally being left behind,https://theverge.com/apple/636335/ipad-2025-11th-generation-review,"Sat, 29 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT","I can tell you the entire story of the 11th-generation iPad by explaining the results of one benchmarking test. It’s called Geekbench, and it’s a cross-platform tool that simulates a bunch of real-world activities to give each device a score that roughly approximates how powerful it is. It’s not perfect (no benchmark is), but it can be revealing. In this case, it shows off an iPad that is very good at the things iPads have always been good at, but it may be about to hit its limit — and definitely isn’t ready for what’s to come.

When you run a Geekbench CPU test on a device like the iPad, it tests both single-core and multicore performance. Most modern devices have multiple cores: the iPad’s A16 chip has five CPU cores and four GPU cores; the current iPad Pro has nine and 10, respectively; and you can spec the latest Mac Studio all the way up to 28 CPU cores and 60 GPU cores. Not all cores are created the same, and we could talk about this forever, but let’s not.

All you need to know is that a single-core process only does one thing at a time and is typically used for simple everyday computing tasks, like running your email app or refreshing your Spotify homepage. Multicore processes, on the other hand, are designed for when lots of things need to happen simultaneously, like when you’re editing video or creating a 3D model that needs to be built, rendered, and moved all at once. Again, there are few hard-and-fast rules to all this. But in general, the more cores you have, the more you can do at once.

Which brings me back to the scores. The new $349 base-model iPad’s scores are practically identical to last year’s M2-powered Air on single-core processes, and this year’s M3 Air only beats it by about 11 percent. This suggests that for most normal, simple iPad things, they should all perform about the same, which has been exactly my experience. Watching videos, browsing the web, swiping through photos — the M3 Air is occasionally a smidge smoother, but they’re all effectively identical.

On the multicore test, though, which measures the device’s ability to do lots of things at once, the base iPad gets absolutely trucked by its brethren. The M3 Air scored more than double the base iPad, and even last year’s M2 Air did 60 percent better on the tests. In Geekbench’s GPU test, which is focused specifically on the kind of intensive graphical processing you’ll care about in video games, editing apps, and powerful creativity tools, both Airs more than doubled the iPad.

What those numbers show is what my testing confirms: that the base iPad is still a lovely, fast, usable device for casual use. It’s an excellent Netflix machine, with an 11-inch screen and four speaker grilles (though only two actual speakers) that pump loud, if not fabulous, sound. It’s great for browsing the web, plenty fast for casual games (I’ve been playing a lot of Dredge and Mini Metro, in addition to my usual diet of crosswords and Tiny Wings), and responsive in everyday use — all in all a very good iPad.

Say what you want about the iPad. The colors are the best.

But as soon as you crank up the intensity, the base iPad starts to falter. There are a bunch of games it simply can’t play: Assassin’s Creed Mirage and Resident Evil 4 just straight-up don’t support the device. There are others, like Call of Duty: Warzone, where you can really feel the lack of graphics power. I’ll be running down a darkened alley in Warzone, and the shadows start to flicker in and out of position, rendering and rerendering a beat too slowly. Even in productivity-focused tools like Notability, the base iPad lags a bit under the weight of a particularly visual page. And if you’re a multitasker, prone to firing up Stage Manager (on an Air or Pro, since the base model doesn’t support the feature) or just a lot of heavy slide-over usage, you’ll notice the difference.

Even if you don’t care about the cores right now, I bet you will pretty soon. The base iPad doesn’t support Apple Intelligence, for instance, and while it’s not missing much right now, there will probably be some worthwhile local AI features in the next few years. (The other AI-related downside: the iPad also has 6GB of RAM, when the Air has 8GB.) As more apps update to take advantage of the extra power on the Air and Pro, they might start to feel even slower on the iPad. The other iPads have much more power than most people need, but that means they have space for you and your needs to grow. The base iPad doesn’t.

The other big tradeoff with the base iPad is the accessories. Both the iPad Pro and iPad Air support the latest Apple Pencil and have very good Magic Keyboard accessories, none of which work on the iPad. Instead, you get the last-gen Pencil and the substantially worse Magic Keyboard Folio. Is it annoying that this tablet is the same size as the 11-inch Air and totally could work in the same keyboard case, except Apple didn’t include the magnets? Yes. But this is where things are.

I still think the iPad is a great tablet, and it’s very good at most of the things most people need from their iPads. If its $349 price fits your budget, or you’re looking for something simple to give to the kids, buy it with no reservations. Frankly, if you just want the thing because the yellow and pink are the best colors Apple offers on any of its devices, I get it. But if you can, you should buy an iPad that will last you at least five years, and ideally even a few more. This iPad is already far enough behind the curve that I’m no longer confident it will last that long. For the first time in a while, I think the Air is the better deal for most people.

DOGE to rapidly rebuild Social Security codebase.,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/what-could-possibly-go-wrong-doge-to-rapidly-rebuild-social-security-codebase/,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 14:08:49 GMT","The so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is starting to put together a team to migrate the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) computer systems entirely off one of its oldest programming languages in a matter of months, potentially putting the integrity of the system—and the benefits on which tens of millions of Americans rely—at risk.

The project is being organized by Elon Musk lieutenant Steve Davis, multiple sources who were not given permission to talk to the media tell WIRED, and aims to migrate all SSA systems off COBOL, one of the first common business-oriented programming languages, and onto a more modern replacement like Java within a scheduled tight timeframe of a few months.

Under any circumstances, a migration of this size and scale would be a massive undertaking, experts tell WIRED, but the expedited deadline runs the risk of obstructing payments to the more than 65 million people in the US currently receiving Social Security benefits.

“Of course one of the big risks is not underpayment or overpayment per se but [it’s also] not paying someone at all and not knowing about it. The invisible errors and omissions,” an SSA technologist tells WIRED.

The Social Security Administration did not immediately reply to WIRED’s request for comment.

SSA has been under increasing scrutiny from President Donald Trump’s administration. In February, Musk took aim at SSA, falsely claiming that the agency was rife with fraud. Specifically, Musk pointed to data he allegedly pulled from the system that showed 150-year-olds in the US were receiving benefits, something that isn’t actually happening. Over the last few weeks, following significant cuts to the agency by DOGE, SSA has suffered frequent website crashes and long wait times over the phone, The Washington Post reported this week.

This proposed migration isn’t the first time SSA has tried to move away from COBOL: In 2017, SSA announced a plan to receive hundreds of millions in funding to replace its core systems. The agency predicted that it would take around five years to modernize these systems. Because of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, the agency pivoted away from this work to focus on more public-facing projects.",arstechnica
https://arstechnica.com,The CDC buried a measles forecast that stressed the need for vaccinations,https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/the-cdc-buried-a-measles-forecast-that-stressed-the-need-for-vaccinations/,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 10:50:17 GMT","ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.

Leaders at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ordered staff this week not to release their experts’ assessment that found the risk of catching measles is high in areas near outbreaks where vaccination rates are lagging, according to internal records reviewed by ProPublica.

In an aborted plan to roll out the news, the agency would have emphasized the importance of vaccinating people against the highly contagious and potentially deadly disease that has spread to 19 states, the records show.

A CDC spokesperson told ProPublica in a written statement that the agency decided against releasing the assessment “because it does not say anything that the public doesn’t already know.” She added that the CDC continues to recommend vaccines as “the best way to protect against measles.”

But what the nation’s top public health agency said next shows a shift in its long-standing messaging about vaccines, a sign that it may be falling in line under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines:

“The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,” the statement said, echoing a line from a column Kennedy wrote for the Fox News website. “People should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine and should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines.”

ProPublica shared the new CDC statement about personal choice and risk with Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health. To her, the shift in messaging, and the squelching of this routine announcement, is alarming.

“I’m a bit stunned by that language,” Nuzzo said. “No vaccine is without risk, but that makes it sound like it’s a very active coin toss of a decision. We’ve already had more cases of measles in 2025 than we had in 2024, and it’s spread to multiple states. It is not a coin toss at this point.”

For many years, the CDC hasn’t minced words on vaccines. It promoted them with confidence. One campaign was called “Get My Flu Shot.” The agency’s website told medical providers they play a critical role in helping parents choose vaccines for their children: “Instead of saying ‘What do you want to do about shots?,’ say ‘Your child needs three shots today.’”

Nuzzo wishes the CDC’s forecasters would put out more details of their data and evidence on the spread of measles, not less. “The growing scale and severity of this measles outbreak and the urgent need for more data to guide the response underscores why we need a fully staffed and functional CDC and more resources for state and local health departments,” she said.

Kennedy’s agency oversees the CDC and on Thursday announced it was poised to eliminate 2,400 jobs there.

When asked what role, if any, Kennedy played in the decision to not release the risk assessment, HHS’s communications director said the aborted announcement “was part of an ongoing process to improve communication processes—nothing more, nothing less.” The CDC, he reiterated, continues to recommend vaccination “as the best way to protect against measles.”

“Secretary Kennedy believes that the decision to vaccinate is a personal one and that people should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine,” Andrew G. Nixon said. “It is important that the American people have radical transparency and be informed to make personal healthcare decisions.”

Responding to questions about criticism of the decision among some CDC staff, Nixon wrote, “Some individuals at the CDC seem more interested in protecting their own status or agenda rather than aligning with this Administration and the true mission of public health.”

The CDC’s risk assessment was carried out by its Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, which relied, in part, on new disease data from the outbreak in Texas. The CDC created the center to address a major shortcoming laid bare during the COVID-19 pandemic. It functions like a National Weather Service for infectious diseases, harnessing data and expertise to predict the course of outbreaks like a meteorologist warns of storms.

Other risk assessments by the center have been posted by the CDC even though their conclusions might seem obvious.

In late February, for example, forecasters analyzing the spread of H5N1 bird flu said people who come “in contact with potentially infected animals or contaminated surfaces or fluids” faced a moderate to high risk of contracting the disease. The risk to the general US population, they said, was low.

In the case of the measles assessment, modelers at the center determined the risk of the disease for the general public in the US is low, but they found the risk is high in communities with low vaccination rates that are near outbreaks or share close social ties to those areas with outbreaks. The CDC had moderate confidence in the assessment, according to an internal Q&A that explained the findings. The agency, it said, lacks detailed data about the onset of the illness for all patients in West Texas and is still learning about the vaccination rates in affected communities as well as travel and social contact among those infected. (The H5N1 assessment was also made with moderate confidence.)

The internal plan to roll out the news of the forecast called for the expert physician who’s leading the CDC’s response to measles to be the chief spokesperson answering questions. “It is important to note that at local levels, vaccine coverage rates may vary considerably, and pockets of unvaccinated people can exist even in areas with high vaccination coverage overall,” the plan said. “The best way to protect against measles is to get the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.”

This week, though, as the number of confirmed cases rose to 483, more than 30 agency staff were told in an email that after a discussion in the CDC director’s office, “leadership does not want to pursue putting this on the website.”

The cancellation was “not normal at all,” said a CDC staff member who spoke anonymously for fear of reprisal with layoffs looming. “I’ve never seen a rollout plan that was canceled at that far along in the process.”

Anxiety among CDC staff has been building over whether the agency will bend its public health messages to match those of Kennedy, a lawyer who founded an anti-vaccine group and referred clients to a law firm suing a vaccine manufacturer.

During Kennedy’s first week on the job, HHS halted the CDC campaign that encouraged people to get flu shots during a ferocious flu season. On the night that the Trump administration began firing probationary employees across the federal government, some key CDC flu webpages were taken down. Remnants of some of the campaign webpages were restored after NPR reported this.

But some at the agency felt like the new leadership had sent a message loud and clear: When next to nobody was paying attention, long-standing public health messages could be silenced.

On the day in February that the world learned that an unvaccinated child had died of measles in Texas, the first such death in the U.S. since 2015, the HHS secretary downplayed the seriousness of the outbreak. “We have measles outbreaks every year,” he said at a cabinet meeting with President Donald Trump.

In an interview on Fox News this month, Kennedy championed doctors in Texas who he said were treating measles with a steroid, an antibiotic and cod liver oil, a supplement that is high in vitamin A. “They’re seeing what they describe as almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery from that,” Kennedy said.

As parents near the outbreak in Texas stocked up on vitamin A supplements, doctors there raced to assure parents that only vaccination, not the vitamin, can prevent measles.

Still, the CDC added an entry on Vitamin A to its measles website for clinicians.

On Wednesday, CNN reported that several hospitalized children in Lubbock, Texas, had abnormal liver function, a likely sign of toxicity from too much vitamin A.

Texas health officials also said that the Trump administration’s decision to rescind $11 billion in pandemic-related grants across the country will hinder their ability to respond to the growing outbreak, according to The Texas Tribune.

Measles is among the most contagious diseases and can be dangerous. About 20 percent of unvaccinated people who get measles wind up in the hospital. And nearly 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications. The virus can linger in the air for two hours after an infected person has left an area, and patients can spread measles before they even know they have it.

This week Amtrak said it was notifying customers that they may have been exposed to the disease this month when a passenger with measles rode one of its trains from New York City to Washington, DC.",arstechnica

Given the Green Lantern movie was mostly set on Earth, there was some concern among fans that the show was going to repeat that film’s mistakes. But according to director James Hawes, the show will do right by the heroes’ cosmic scope.

In an interview with Collider, Hawes assured there wouldn’t be any shortage of “sci-fi magic” amid its Nebraska setting. “It’s done in a world where you accept that these things just are,” he said of Lanterns‘ fantastical elements. As someone without much superhero experience before this project, he said he was “bewitched” by his foray into the genre. “You always find a scene or two that you think, ‘I can’t wait to be beside the camera and the cast, directing this scene.’ You know this is something you have to take seriously, and that absolutely happened with Lanterns.”

Hawes continued with mentions of the show’s humor—it’s “very particular” and his episodes will hopefully be similar to his work on Slow Horses and Black Mirror—and its “electric” cast. Of Pierre and Chandler, he felt they brought “charm” and “authenticity” to their roles. “These are two people you just want to hang out with. [….] You want to go on that journey. You get people who are just so classy and so busy inhabiting their roles, so you never doubt it. They’re not on the outside—they’re deep in those skins.”

Lanterns is scheduled to release on Max and HBO sometime in 2026.",gizmodo

You can count Black Panther among them, since we haven’t seen anything from Letitia Wright’s Shuri since Wakanda Forever back in 2022. We don’t know anything about a third film…well, except that it may feature Denzel Washington.

During last November’s press circuit for Gladiator II, Washington claimed he would join the MCU through Coogler’s franchise. There hasn’t been any official news yet, but Coogler recently told Shannon Sharpe in an interview he was “dying” to work with the esteemed actor, who he called “a living legend and a great mentor. He’s always looking out for us. I got every intention of working with him in [Black Panther 3] as long as he’s interested.” For his part, Washington sounded pretty game last year when he talked about taking on new challenges before retirement, so it could very much happen.

Black Panther is one of several franchises who’ve had sizable gaps between solo installments, and Marvel hasn’t even officially confirmed a third installment is happening. Wakanda Forever’s four-year wait was largely due to Chadwick Boseman’s death in 2020 and the subsequent pivot to Shuri as the title hero. Recent rumors have suggested Marvel may be trying to introduce a new T’Challa, though it’s unclear if this would be a multiverse variant or an adult version of his son introduced in Wakanda. Coogler didn’t address that, but when asked about the wait for Panther 3, he told Sharpe the wait would be “not long.”

Until then, we have Coogler’s Sinner on April 18, and Avengers: Doomsday on May 1, 2026.

Demonstrators turned out in significant numbers in large cities, including New York City and Chicago, with many holding signs featuring anti-Elon Musk and anti-Trump administration messaging.

Accounts from across the country continue to pour in, but despite the presence of counter-protesters in some locations, the demonstrations seem to have largely gone without incidents of violence or arrests.

An account from the Boston Herald says that two people were injured at a Tesla Takedown demonstration in the Boston suburb of Watertown when a black pickup truck allegedly clipped the protesters with the vehicle’s side mirror. More than 100 protesters were reportedly on the scene during the incident, and both people hit by the vehicle refused medical treatment and did not suffer serious injuries. Police in Columbus, Ohio were also seen escorting two anti-Tesla demonstrators in dinosaur costumes from a Tesla dealership during a Tesla Takedown event.

In Florida, Attorney General James Uthmeier ordered law enforcement to monitor the events and respond with a zero-tolerance policy for crimes against property, but local reporting indicated that dozens of protests occurred across the state without incident.

Local reports suggest that at least 150 people turned out to a Tesla Takedown event in the outskirts of Chicago, more than 300 people showed up to a protest outside of Syracuse, New York, more than 600 in a suburb of Baltimore. Similar numbers were reported in St. Louis, Missouri, Buffalo, New York, Salt Lake City, Utah, and other cities. Social media posts show large demonstrations in Seattle and Ann Arbor, Michigan, while some counter-protesters were documented in Meridian, Idaho and Paramus, New Jersey—though the pro-Musk demonstrations appear to have been significantly smaller than the Tesla Takedown events.

While most of the protests took place in the United States, there were international demonstrations as part of the day of action. NBC News reported protesters turned out at Tesla dealerships in Edinburgh, Scotland, and Berlin, Germany. London also saw a large turnout of Tesla Takedown demonstrators.

The organizers of the Tesla Takedown protests have chosen Tesla as their target as a means to inflict damage onto CEO Elon Musk’s bottom line, a response to his involvement in the Trump administration, including his leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency, which has led to dramatic reductions in the federal workforce. A common theme among the signage was kicking Musk out of the government (or the country) and demanding an end to the slashing of government services and social safety nets.

About 300 protesters showed up to a protest in San Diego, where there’s a retail storefront at the mall near the University of California, San Diego. Despite being so close to a college campus, the protest crowd skewed older, a common theme at demonstrations over the past two months.

An 83-year-old retired geologist named Dorrie told Gizmodo she had two sisters protesting as well, one in Boston and one in Orange County, California, both concerned about what Elon Musk was doing to the country. “He’s putting seniors on the street. Turning senior citizens into homeless people,” she told Gizmodo.

“I don’t know how we’re gonna get out of it, either,” Dorrie continued. “Have you heard any creative ways of how, you know, you screw up the system for four years and then you change it? Everybody gets their jobs back, you know?”",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Are Vehicle Infotainment Screens Headed for the Scrap Heap?,https://gizmodo.com/are-vehicle-infotainment-screens-headed-for-the-scrap-heap-2000580600,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 11:00:23 GMT","Today’s tech-heavy cars are more advanced than they’ve ever been, and while some aspects of that shift are inarguably good, certain features have fallen out of favor with the public. One of the most prominent and problematic auto trends is the infotainment screen.

It’s easy to see why touch screens and large displays initially caught on. They’re sleek, enabling you to interact with your car in much the same way you’d interact with your smartphone. In practice, though, the tech is flawed, and drivers are pushing back.

Infotainment screens have been around for years. Once Tesla gained traction with its iPad-like controls in the mid-2010s, the technology took over. Today, roughly 97% of new vehicles have a touch screen, and nearly a quarter have one that’s 11 inches or larger.

Automakers have been eagerly adding new functions to these screens. Some infotainment systems let you access iMessage and even Netflix from the driver’s seat, while others use them to keep all your car’s controls in one place, often behind layers of menus.

Tech companies have promoted plans to take these displays even further, though what exactly that will look like and when it could happen is unclear. Apple has delayed its CarPlay upgrade without giving a new release date, despite revealing the system in 2022. Google has become the go-to software provider in the meantime, but the trend toward touch screens and digitalization may be slowing down.

As much as carmakers seem to love infotainment screens, consumers are less enthusiastic about them. Just 15% of drivers in 2024 said they would want a full-width infotainment display. Windshield base displays with less functionality are slightly more popular but still appeal to just 18% of those planning on buying a new car.

The growing pushback against vehicle touch screens is ultimately a matter of safety and convenience. While having all your controls in one place sounds useful, navigating between menus to find the right settings can be frustrating, slow, and unsafe if done while driving. It also means basic car functions may be at the mercy of software glitches and lag.

In 2021, Tesla had to recall vehicles because an issue with the flash memory in Tesla infotainment systems made the rearview camera unviewable and took defrost and turn signal functions offline. More recently, a class-action lawsuit against Stellantis alleges that defective infotainment screens led to backup camera failures and distracting audio glitches.

Those same shortcomings, alongside the obvious distracting features of an iPad in your center console, pose safety concerns, too. Navigating between menus takes focus off the road, especially when adjusting a setting takes more steps than it used to. Given that 6,000 pedestrians a year already die in traffic accidents, anything that takes a driver’s eyes off the road isn’t ideal.

Some car brands have started responding to these concerns by toning down the “screenification” of their vehicles. Volkswagen announced it will bring back physical buttons after backlash against its more screen-heavy models. VW CEO Thomas Schäfer said the reliance on touch screens “did a lot of damage” to the brand’s reputation among frustrated drivers.

When VW pivoted to a touch screen-centric interface, Capital One’s Auto Navigator called the controls “aggravating,” as did many other reviewers. Yahoo Autos called it the worst infotainment system they had ever come across. In light of these responses, it’s easy to see why VW would want to move back to physical buttons.

Given this growing push against infotainment touch screens, automakers will likely respond. However, how they choose to balance demands for safety and convenience with new tech is less certain.

Some companies think the solution is to keep digital displays but change how they operate. BMW unveiled a new heads-up display (HUD) at CES 2025 that puts more information along the bottom of the windshield instead of keeping it on the dash. As BMW board member Frank Weber explained, this system means “the driver decides themselves which information they want to display in their own field of vision.” Infotainment-style customization remains present, but it stays within the line of sight while looking at the road.

BMW’s new HUD also lets drivers control these settings through physical buttons on the steering wheel, not just a touch screen. That way, hands can remain on the wheel and eyes can remain forward. Hyundai and Kia have followed a similar approach, giving users a choice between touch or analog controls.

Voice commands have emerged as another alternative. Mercedes introduced ChatGPT-backed voice controls in 2023, and Apple gave CarPlay voice functionality with iOS 18. These don’t make screens go away, but they do offer a way to use them that doesn’t require taking your hands off the wheel or eyes off the road.

As the industry explores these voice-activated solutions, it’s clear that the evolution of infotainment systems is far from over. Growing attention on common issues should kick-start some much-needed changes.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Hypershell Review: Makes Tackling Hard Hikes Almost Too Easy,https://gizmodo.com/the-hypershell-exoskeleton-is-so-good-at-climbing-cliffs-it-ruined-my-workout-2000580676,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 13:00:48 GMT","The hiking trail should be a serene place. Amid the sounds of water running tickling down a nearby stream and the rushing wind through the trees above, there comes a whirring noise. It’s me. I am the disturbance. Me and my Hypershell Pro X exoskeleton are buzzing down the mud-strewn path like a machine on a warpath. The Hypershell is a device made for assisting your walks, runs, bikes, or hikes. In a rarity for weird tech, the hiking exoskeleton accomplishes nearly everything it promises to. It does its job so well, and it left me devoid of the exercise and that sense of calm I normally get from my hikes.

After wearing the $1,000 Hypershell Pro X on a day hike, I felt like I could do the same 3-hour route another two times before I felt tired. It’s as if I was strapped into some tireless machine of war out of Edge of Tomorrow. Taking off the Hypershell was like kneecapping myself. I was more lethargic, heavier despite the reduction in weight. The Hypershell Pro X is 4-pound device that looks like an early Iron-Man prototype.

Hypershell Pro X This exoskeleton will make long hikes a little easier if you can avoid the price (and weight.) Pros Relatively light, sturdy, and comfortable design

Multiple torque settings helps with your workout Long-lasting battery Cons Hard to find comfortable position to sit

Hard to find comfortable position to sit Makes you look like a cyborg

Makes you look like a cyborg Pricey especially if you’ll rarely use it

I took the hike with two compatriots, and those friends were keen to make jokes at my expense. I was the tutorial NPC in a video game with a walk speed slightly faster than the player character, which in turn forced me to continuously stop and wait for them at their slower pace. I made a quiet-but-noticeable whirring sound on every step, and when a machine is literally pulling your leg for miles it can detract from the peace of nature. People I passed on the trail tried and failed to not stare at me.

It made the experience of hiking more awkward than it should. I rarely have a day free to drive out for such an experience, so when I do I want to relish the scenery as well as the burn in my legs. But there are plenty of people who can benefit from this device. If you want to tackle heights and don’t have the body to do it, the Hypershell may do the trick—even if it means your friends will quote RoboCop behind your back every five minutes.

The Hypershell Pro X Makes Hiking Almost Too Easy

Wearing the exoskeleton felt more invasive than I initially expected. You wrap the battery and rear support around your back and clamp it around your waist so the weight rests on your hips. Then, you strap to the leg bands around each thigh. You have to draw each clasp tighter than you might expect, especially if you want to avoid the device rubbing on you through your pants. There’s enough give on the straps and armature to support multiple waist sizes, but I don’t imagine it will fit every body type.

Through its sensors, the Hypershell detects your leg movement and then offers 125 W motors to assist with propulsion at a max 32 Newton-meters of torque. You won’t have the device on max settings all the time, but the feeling of your legs being outside your control takes getting used to. On higher torque settings, your leg will shoot up from the ground with little impetus on your part. Dropping your leg will signal the Hypershell to descend as well, at speed. It feels much weirder on a flat plane than it does on a hill. Even minimal torque will emphasize lifting your leg for each step, rather than the usual strolling gait.

My small hiking party took to the Anthony’s Nose trail close to Fort Montgomery, NY. We started at a trailhead that promised a 3-hour hike with a total elevation gain of 888 feet. This is a hike along the same mountain range bordering Hudson River as Breakneck Ridge, a climb with a much steeper slope and a demanding rock scramble. I’ve done that hike on two separate occasions over the past two years, so Anthony’s Nose was tame by comparison.

The device makes it easy to switch between more or less torque with just a few strikes of the power button. On the trail’s steepest incline full of loose rocks, I found I didn’t have any burn in my thighs after close to 10 minutes of continuous climbing. I felt more effort from my calves, but that feeling slowly dissipated. The device was comfortable the entire time, with no riding or chafing to speak of thanks to its effective rear and side padding. The only issue was finding a comfortable position to sit after I reached the trail peak overlooking the winding Hudson. The battery pack sticks out in such a way it leans against the tailbone and rides up into the spine if you put your weight on it. Sitting down may also scuff up the pucks on each side of Hypershell, if you’re not careful.

I normally hike up steep trails by spreading my legs wide and centering my weight forward. With Hypershell, I was limited to a more straightforward gait. At one point, I moved onto my haunches to check out a small pond and heard something in the mechanism catch. I found the power indicator light rapidly blinking red. Unseating then reattaching the battery fixed the issue, and I didn’t experience any mechanical issues after that.

The device had very minimal latency, so much that I got used to the speed of its operation. What most surprised me about Hypershell Pro X was its battery life. After a 3-hour hike continuously using the motorized assist, my battery was down by around 30 to 40%, judging by the indicator light. I even had a backup 72 Whr battery in my backpack that was superfluous. Still, this was in 60 degree Fahrenheit weather, and I did not test the battery life in hotter or cooler temps. The company claims it has an operating temperature from -4 degrees to 140 degrees Fahrenheit, but I imagine that going out into freezing temperatures will impact the exoskeleton’s battery.

Hypershell claims its device offsets 30 kilograms, or 66 pounds of weight. Walking around with the device off reminded me of the actual weight of the Hypershell. It clocks in at just under 4 pounds, so the motorized assist is carrying itself and you. Experienced hikers will tell you the old adage, “ounces become pounds” when you’re considering how much you should pack before hitting the trail. It’s a good thing the battery lasts as long as it does, as it would be bad news to be caught out on the trail lugging around four extra pounds of weight if you’re trying to go long-distance.

Who is the Hypershell Pro X Actually For?

There are three versions of the Hypershell. The $900 Hypershell Go has a more-limited 400 W output with a 15 kilometer (9.3-mile) battery range on a full charge. The $1,000 Pro X has a 800W output and 17.5 kilometer (10.8-mile) range. The more-expensive device is also built with stairs, mountaineering, and cycling in mind. The Carbon X trades the Pro’s carbon fiber polymer frame for a 3D-formed titanium alloy. That last version will set you back $1,500. Unless you’re really planning to take the Hypershell on hard peaks that could damage your exoskeleton, you can likely make due with the cheaper options. A $1,000 price point seems steep, but the Hypershell is cheap compared to similar kinds of hiking exoskeleton like the Arc’teryx Mo/Go exoskeleton hiking pants that start at $5,000. And it actually ships, unlike the $1,200 Dnsys X1. That device was first previewed in 2024 but is still listed as up for preorder.

Based on its promo materials and website, Hypershell wants to grab the young audience who has cash to burn. In reality, this device is geared toward those who don’t—or can’t—get out to exercise in the great outdoors. I imagine the real use cases are from those who want to enjoy nature despite inability, injury, or age.

This exoskeleton can’t be for everyone. It may not help those with particular knee injuries, as it still requires you to extend your thigh and project your lower leg even when the exoskeleton is assisting your movement. It also restricts you from taking a larger hiking backpack, especially those designed to rest on your hips (they’ll be occupied by the Hypershell’s battery pack). For those who physically can’t enjoy the serenity of the outdoors, the Hypershell is a way to get outside. I won’t use it, but I already know of some parents getting on in years who could desperately use some quality time with nature.",gizmodo

While it’s one of the most effective forms of contraceptives and avoids the inconvenience of having to take a pill every day, the implant requires minor surgery, which can limit accessibility. To make life a bit easier, researchers are creating a self-assembling contraceptive implant the components of which women could self-administer with a single injection.

A team of researchers has developed the technology for self-injectable contraceptive shots that work similarly to contraceptive implants. As detailed in a study published Monday in the journal Nature Chemical Engineering, the shots would result in a highly effective and long-term contraceptive method more accessible to women who lack easy access to medical infrastructure. Additionally, the design could be used to administer other long-term medications, such as those for HIV.

The new approach delivers the contraceptive hormonal medication levonorgestrel via what the researchers call “Self-assembling Long-acting Injectable Microcrystals” (SLIM). Once injected into the body, the tiny crystals assemble into an implant, or a drug “depot,” that releases levonorgestrel as it erodes over months or years.

“The overarching goal is to give women access to a lot of different formats for contraception that are easy to administer, compatible with being used in the developing world, and have a range of different timeframes of durations of action,” Vivian Feig, a mechanical engineer at Stanford University and co-author on the study, said in a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) statement.

Traditional birth control shots already exist and are more accessible than the contraceptive implant because patients can give themselves the shots without having to visit a hospital or medical clinic. However, they are slightly less effective than the implant and are not long-lasting, so they must be administered every three months.

The researchers’ new contraceptive design joins the accessibility of self-administered shots with the long-term efficacy of an implant. The challenge of self-administering technologies similar to SLIM, however, has been the large (and hence painful) needle size necessary to inject the medication. By contrast, the team’s formula—tiny crystals and a solvent (in this case a liquid compound called benzyl benzoate)—allows for the use of much smaller needles.

“Needle size and liquid viscosity are crucial considerations for commercial translation of injectables,” said Giovanni Traverso, senior author of the study and a gastroenterologist at MIT and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, in a Mass General Brigham statement. “Our engineering challenge was finding a way to maximize comfort for patients by using smaller needles, which cause less bruising or bleeding, and to make the viscosity low enough for easy application with the syringe by hand.”

Furthermore, Traverso and his colleagues can modify the mixture to “modulate the drug release rate, extending its duration while maintaining injectability,” MIT graduate student Sanghyun Park explained in the MIT statement. “This demonstrates the tunability of our system, which can be engineered to accommodate a broader range of contraceptive needs as well as tailored dosing regimens for other therapeutic applications.”

While SLIM hasn’t gone through clinical trials yet, the development of the technology in preclinical models paves the way for more convenient and effective future long-term medications.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Struck by Lightning? This Tree Kinda Likes it,https://gizmodo.com/struck-by-lightning-this-tree-kinda-likes-it-2000581812,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 12:00:19 GMT","If you’re stuck outside in the middle of a lightning storm, the most common advice is to stay away from trees, which might attract lightning. And while getting struck by lightning would certainly be very bad news for you, new research suggests certain trees might draw unexpected benefits from the electrocution.

A team of researchers has revealed that Dipteryx oleifera—a tall tropical tree with a large crown and native to Colombia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Panama—not only tolerates lightning strikes but actually benefits from them, and may even have evolved to attract lightning. Their work is detailed in a study published Wednesday in the journal New Phytologist.

Led by Evan Gora, a forest ecologist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, the team was inspired to investigate D. oleifera’s relationship with lightning after discovering a unique specimen in Panama in 2015. The tree had survived getting struck by lightning with little damage, despite the fact that the electrocution had killed a parasitic vine tangled in its branches, in addition to a dozen trees in its vicinity.

“Seeing that there are trees that get struck by lightning and they’re fine was just mind blowing,” Gora said in a Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies statement. Seven years later, the researchers discovered that some trees are more resistant to lightning strikes than others. Now, the team claims to be the first to demonstrate that, for some species, being struck might actually be beneficial.

Gora and his colleagues observed the wellbeing of 93 trees in central Panama’s Barro Colorado Nature Monument for two to six years after each was struck by lightning, tracking their mortality rates, the condition of their trunks and crowns, the presence of vines or lianas, and the survival rate of neighboring trees.

Nine of the 93 trees were D. oleifera, and all of them survived getting struck by lightning with little damage. The electrocution reduced their parasitic vines by 78% and killed an average of 9.2 of their neighboring trees. In stark contrast, other tree species were significantly worse off—they lost 5.7 more leaves, and 64% of them died within two years.

In Gora’s words, “It’s better off for a Dipteryx oleifera tree to be struck than not.”

Furthermore, the team found their observations to be broadly consistent across all D. oleifera trees. The species as a whole seems to have fewer vine infestations, and over the past four decades their neighboring trees were 48% more likely to die than other trees in the forest. Thanks to drone technology, the researchers also noted that D. oleifera trees generally tower around 13 feet (four meters) over nearby trees—potentially because any tall neighbors were taken out by lightning.

The reduction in vine infestation and tall neighbors gives D. oleifera trees more access to light and nutrients, and as a result, a competitive advantage over other tree species. The researchers calculated that D. oleifera‘s lightning tolerance makes them 14 times more likely to produce offspring. Good thing, too, because according to the study, they might be up to 68% more likely to get struck by lightning than the average tree. One of the nine D. oleifera observed by the researchers was hit by lightning twice in half a decade.

It’s hard not to think that with all these benefits, the trees might be doing it on purpose. As a matter of fact, Gora and his colleagues suggest that D. oleifera might have evolved to attract lightning, similarly to a lightning rod.

Overall, the study provides insight on the role of lightning tolerance in biodiversity. This is especially important in the context of climate change, which might bring more lightning storms in certain regions, according to the statement. Moving forward, the researchers are hoping to better understand the mechanisms behind the tree’s resistance to lightning.

Moral of the story: don’t stand under trees during a lightning storm—especially a D. oleifera!",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,A New Star Wars Chapter Begins at Disneyland’s Galaxy’s Edge,https://gizmodo.com/a-new-star-wars-chapter-begins-at-disneylands-galaxys-edge-2000582456,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 00:00:28 GMT","Starting today at Galaxy’s Edge in Disneyland, Star Wars fans will be able to meet Master Luke Skywalker in Batuu. His arrival is the latest evolution in the theme park’s canon, which had once limited itself to the time period between Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.

The change to that original timeline came gradually these past couple of years as figures from Disney+ Lucasfilm shows have popped up in Batuu, incuding Ahsoka, Boba Fett, Fennec Shand, Sabine Wren, and Hera. And of course the Mandalorian and Grogu have had a huge presence at the parks because of fan demand for characters outside of the sequel trilogy.

io9 attended today’s opening of Season of the Force 2025—Disneyland’s annual Star Wars celebration, running now through May 11—and talked to Matt Martin from Lucasfilm and Michael Serna of Disney Live Entertainment to discuss how the story of the Black Spire Outpost will evolve from here.

“We look at all of our lands and experience as an evolution,” Serna shared. “Some things come and go, shows open, attractions come and go. So of course Galaxy’s Edge is going through the same journey; [it] evolves, and when we built Galaxy’s Edge, we didn’t even know that some of these stories would be told. So as time has grown on, we realized, who doesn’t love the Mandalorian story, who doesn’t love various different stories? So this is an opportunity for us to sort of lean into those stories we know our fans love and admire, while not pulling away from anything we’ve done before. Sometimes you’ll see something you love and sometimes you won’t. Our goal is to reach as many of our fans as possible and deliver all those amazing characters and experiences that people expect from our parks.”

That shift will become more defined this year, and it all begins with the lore weaver Tohan Lege—a character created for the Galaxy’s Edge fireworks show last year. Originally a disembodied voice narrating tales of the heroes and villains that are real within the land, this year he joins his trusty R1-series astromech droid Bard in illuminating the spires with projections of their history in “Shadows of Memory: A Skywalker Saga,” a show exploring the tragedy and triumphs of the family that connects them all.

Lucasfilm created him in collaboration with the parks to appear as a telling-stories-around-the-fire sort of figure. “Now we’ve got him as the centerpiece of ‘Shadows of Memory.’ And so it’s so perfect to have somebody to tell the mythical saga of the Skywalker story, because Star Wars is itself kind of a modern myth,” Martin said. “Having an in-universe character to do that storytelling is just kind of a perfect bridge for both of those shows that we have here. And hopefully we get to continue using that character as a storyteller for years to come both in the park and in other Star Wars stories.”

This is key in opening up the stories told within the land and the characters who may pop up in the future from across the Star Wars canon, Serna confirmed. “Star Wars has so many stories to tell. Matt and I had a lot of discussions about how do we sort of introduce things, like Fire of Memory [in] the fireworks show. We had this idea that a storyteller is the universal thing that’s happened at the beginning of [humankind]. It’s our lifestyle. We gather around a fire and tell a story. That’s how we’ve passed on histories and mythologies. So why would the galaxy of Star Wars be any different? There would be people that would want to collect these stories and tell them to future generations.”

We can’t wait to see what other stories make their way to the parks—in addition to Master Luke Skywalker, who we got to witness making his first grand entrance this afternoon.

As for any changes coming to the Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run ride to coincide with next year’s big-screen release of The Mandalorian and Grogu—well, Disney is still very much keeping that under wraps. “I mean, we can’t talk too much about that,” Serna teased. “We don’t have much to tell yet. Because other than what you learned at South by Southwest, we can’t really talk about it.”

Martin added, “What I will say is that it will be another authentic Mandalorian story, and obviously we will be in the Millennium Falcon. So we’re going to get to learn how we end up in the Millennium Falcon in a time where Han Solo owns that ship. So that should be pretty fun. But otherwise, I think you’ll have to wait and see.”

We also asked if any of the standout draws from Florida’s now-shuttered Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser might be coming to Batuu, such as the lightsaber experiences or our beloved Gaya’s dinner show.

Serna said, “I would say we’re always continuing to grow and do new things. You never know.”

We asked if we should be optimistic, and Martin added, “We learned a lot from that, you know, from a storytelling point of view. So I think the lessons that we’ve learned will always inform the future.”

March is a great month, as the VPN is yet again on a flashy sale that drops the price of the VPN by up to 77%.

You’ll be able to spend as little as $3.09 a month, yet enjoy the internet in total privacy, by your rules. We’ll see how NordVPN helps you achieve that and explore its four amazing biennial plans – stay tuned.

Go Private With NordVPN

NordVPN simplifies online privacy with one-click connections. Once you get it, all you have to do is choose the VPN server, and boom – your activities are safe and sound.

The VPN endorses this with 256-bit AES encryption, mighty RAM-only servers, and a no-log policy, which guarantees total privacy. The VPN lets you enjoy blocked content thanks to 7,400+ servers in 118 countries.

Thus, apart from security and privacy, it’s great for streaming and accessing blocked online bookies. NordVPN pairs this with reliable P2P servers, which many use for torrenting. Lest we forget its Double VPN feature. It encrypts your traffic twice, rendering you a ghost online!

NordVPN spans all devices, allowing for end-to-end privacy protection on Windows, macOS, Android, Linux, and iOS. With 10 simultaneous connections, you can connect on every device you own at no added cost.

As a premium VPN, it comes with essentials like unlimited bandwidth, 10 Gbps server ports, 24/7 customer support, and much more. All of this at three monthly quids – must be a joke, right?

Flash Sale: Get Your Discount Now

No – we’re dead serious and NordVPN is as well.

The flashiest sale so far allows you to jump on the hype train and save up to 77% on NordVPN’s 24-month plans, all of which are now enriched by 3 free months.

The Basic plan at $3.09/mo comes with the VPN only, which is still fantastic and very affordable. Instead of hundreds of dollars, you’ll spend less than $84 for 27 months.

Try NordVPN Risk-Free

By far, the best savings are made on the Prime plan at $6.99/mo, which includes NordLocker, NordPass, and NordProtect – all three amazing privacy tools! NordVPN’s self-proclaimed best value is the Plus plan.

At $3.99/mo or $107 for 27 months, it’s an ideal plan to cover all your needs. Besides, it can block ads with Threat Protection Pro and includes NordPass, a popular password manager to make each login simpler.

Last but not least, NordVPN advertises its 30-day money-back guarantee as a risk-free means of testing it. If you’re dissatisfied or don’t want to pay anymore, get a full refund in 30 days, no questions asked.

One thing is for certain — right now at Amazon it’s at its best price ever, with a 23% off sale creating a $329 deal (down from $429) that’s way too good to pass up.

See at Amazon

With an always-on display that’s up to 30% larger than previous models of the Apple Watch, a revamped design emphasizing comfort and a light feel on your wrist, faster charging, and even more health and fitness features than before, the Apple Watch Series 10 has been selling like crazy — over 10,000 in the past month on Amazon alone. This 23% off deal is just going to drive those numbers higher still, and it’s the best time for you to jump on the bandwagon.

Your Workout Partner

The Apple Watch has leaned heavily into its fitness and health tracking abilities since debuting 10 years ago, and the Series 10 is no exception. It has all of the trackers of the previous Apple Watches, and adds tracking modes for kayakers, canoers, and rowers, and the new Tides app which monitors coastal conditions. If you’re ready to give the Apple Watch Series 10’s aquatic features a try, you’ll be covered by the improved 50-meter water resistance and water temperature sensors.

See at Amazon

The rest of Apple’s superior health tracking is present and accounted for in the Series 10, including on-demand ECG readings, heart and respiration measurements while you sleep, and also detection for signs of sleep apnea. If you’re looking to check your heart rate while running or working out, you no longer have to fumble to touch the screen — the display of the Series 10 is always on, and it’s up to 30% larger and 40% brighter than previous models.

Slim Pickings

When you first feel the Apple Watch Series 10 on your wrist, you’ll wonder if the smartwatch has been the one hitting the gym. The Series 10 is 10% thinner than the Series 9, which is hardly a bulky watch. Other upgrades include IP6X dust resistance, vastly improved sound for when you’re taking a call, and the best charging time of any Apple Watch yet — only 30 minutes to get up to 80%.

There will, of course, be more Apple Watches to come. The Series 10 debuted only a year after the Series 9, and invariably a Series 11 will come along. But the Series 10 is so good that grabbing one now while it’s at its lowest-ever price at Amazon, just $329, will likely meet your smartwatch needs for years to come.

https://gizmodo.com,How to Watch MotoGP Americas MotoGP on a Free Channel,https://gizmodo.com/how-to-watch-motogp-americas-gp-on-a-free-channel-2000580490,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 14:00:30 GMT","After the race in Argentina, MotoGP is back. Will Marc Marquez keep up his momentum? To find out, many of you are looking for a free live stream to watch the Americas GP. Fortunately, you won’t have to look far.

In this guide, we’ll explain how to watch the Americas Grand Prix on a free channel from anywhere. This is a risk-free solution that most people online use for this and more MotoGP race live streams.

Date and schedule Sprint race at 3:00 PM PST / 6:00 PM EST | Sunday’s race at 2:00 PM PST / 5:00 PM EST Free channel ServusTV (Austria), RTS/SRF (Switzerland) Watch the race from anywhere with NordVPN

Where Can You Watch the Race at COTA Online for Free?

Expensive sports-streaming platforms are out of reach for most people. Their high monthly fees usually aren’t justified when all you can do is watch sports.

We found that ServusTV, an Austrian TV channel, lets you broadcast the race for free. Moreover, the live stream is in Full HD, albeit with German commentary.

The good news is that ServusTV doesn’t require an account, which means you can visit the website on the given day and immediately watch the Americas Grand Prix for free anywhere.

However, ServusTV’s content is exclusive to Austria, spawning this notorious error message to people abroad (which means “This video is not available”):

How to Watch Americas Grand Prix on a Free Channel

People online have detected that ServusTV works exclusively with an Austrian IP address. The website works by detecting the user’s IP address. If it’s outside Austria, the user is blocked.

On the flip side, altering an IP address with a VPN, such as NordVPN, produces immediate effects. Once the user connects to an Austrian VPN server, they’re assigned an Austrian IP.

Watch the race online with NordVPN

This effectively “fools” ServusTV into “thinking” the user is in Austria, which allows access to all of the content, including the free live stream of MotoGP Americas Grand Prix.

NordVPN is often used because of its worldwide popularity.

It’s fast, reliable, and equipped with Austrian VPN servers. However, it’s also free for 30 days thanks to a money-back guarantee, which allows people to enjoy multiple Grand Prix races without spending a dime.

Simply put, they watch the race no matter where they are, get a refund from NordVPN in the given period (30 days), and end up not losing a cent.

Red Bull Grand Prix of The Americas Schedule

The official Americas GP free live stream schedule tells us that the event starts on the 27th of March and ends on the 30th of March.

While most racing fans are excited for the main race, which is on the 30th of March at 14:00 PST, it’s handy to have a full schedule ready, just in case you want to chime in beforehand.

For your reference, all times are in PST.

27th March: 11:30 GearUp, 12:00 Pre-Event Press Conference

11:30 GearUp, 12:00 Pre-Event Press Conference 28th March: 10:45 Free Practice 1, 15:00 Practice

10:45 Free Practice 1, 15:00 Practice 29th March: 10:10 Free Practice 2, 10:50, Qualifying 1, 11:15 Qualifying 2, 15:00 Sprint (10 laps)

10:10 Free Practice 2, 10:50, Qualifying 1, 11:15 Qualifying 2, 30th of March: 9:40 Warm Up, 14:00 Grand Prix (20 laps)

Can I Watch the Americas Grand Prix on VideoPass?

VideoPass is a great option for avid MotoGP fans. However, it doesn’t offer a free live stream of the Americas Grand Prix because it’s a paid service.

The official website allows you to subscribe to it monthly or annually, but the best-value option is the latter. In that case, you’ll have to spend around $139.99 yearly. The monthly version is $29.99/mo.

There’s a four-day trial at $0.00, but without access to live and on-demand races. No matter how you look at it, VideoPass is costlier than a VPN, which offers the option to get a refund.

Even if you don’t get a refund, NordVPN costs roughly $80 for the first 2 years, and you can do a lot more with it.

The race is approaching fast, so it’s time to act. Who will stand in the middle of the podium? Will Morbidelli catch up with fierce Marquez brothers? The Americas Grand Prix hopefully holds some answers!

Outdoor workouts like running and biking go hand in hand with high quality wireless headphones, and the Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth headphones are at the head of the class. They’re also $100 off during Amazon’s Big Spring Sale which makes them a total steal at just $249 (down from $349).

See at Amazon

The QuietComfort name is a perfect description of the two top selling points of these Bose headphones which were released in 2023 and have been a huge hit among reviewers and buyers alike. Exceptional and customizable noise cancellation lets you disappear into your music or other content, and the ultra-plush earcup cushions and a padded headband keep the Bose QuietComfort headphones securely in place without feeling heavy or squeezing your head.

Custom Sounds

Both the noise cancellation and the overall sound of the Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth headphones earn high marks overall, with an emphasis on the level of customization they allow the user. Adjustable EQ lets you choose the levels of the bass, midrange, and treble, and change them anytime you like. The bass in particular can be juiced up to give you the deep pounding club experience, but you would probably want to tone it down for an audiobook or podcast.

See at Amazon

When the Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth headphones are placed in Quiet mode, the pro-level noise cancelling kicks in and eliminates virtually all of the external noise around. That’s perfect for a deeply immersive listening session or for a long flight, but when you’re out walking, running, or biking and need to be aware of traffic and the rest of your surroundings, you can easily switch the QuietComfort headphones to Aware mode to let in those sounds for safety’s sake.

Built-In Endurance

The Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth headphones charge via the included USB-C cable, and a full charge will give you a full 24 hours of listening time. If you’ve let the headphones go down to zero, a 15-minute quick charge will get you 2.5 hours of play time. Connecting the headphones with the included audio cable, which has a built-in microphone, lets you use the headphones without Bluetooth, which comes in handy if your battery is low.

Need more great selling points? If you need to take a call using the Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth headphones while outside on a breezy day, the Wind Block mode will help your voice get through loud and clear without interference. And the Bose app is a great option not only for controlling the headphones, but also for downloading the most recent updates.

The Amazon Big Spring Sale’s $100-off deal is an ideal opportunity to upgrade from your old headphones or earbuds to the Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth headphones, adding pro-level noise cancellation, comfort, and overall outstanding sound to whatever you’re listening to. They’re just $249 while this deal lasts.

We can finally hang out outside again! And no outside hang out is complete without good music—and a good sound system. We’re not all getting together to listen to Dua Lipa on a phone stuck inside a red Solo cup. We want rich booming sound that’s still only the size of a phone in a red Solo cup.

The Anker Soundcore 2 portable speaker is here to save the day and great news: During Amazon’s Big Spring Sale, you can grab one for up to 38% off. Normally priced at about $45, the black model has dropped down to just $27. Additionally, the more fun color options including blue, red, and teal are also on sale.

This is a portable speaker at its finest. Measuring in at only 6.5″ long, the Anker Soundcore 2 can easily fit into your bag for easy travel. The Bluetooth 5.0 ensures you’ll maintain a stable connection to your phone or other audio source even as you’re wandering throughout your yard at the next barbecue.

The Bluetooth Anker Soundcore 2 is IPX7 waterproof so you can take it poolside or to the beach without worrying about it getting splashed on—or heck, even fully submerged in the water. That also makes it ideal for listening to music in the shower.

All-Day Listening

This speaker is designed by Anker, so you know it’s battery is gonna be absolutely top tier. Packing 5,200mAh, you’ll be able to listen to your favorite music, podcasts, or audiobooks for a solid 24 hours on a full charge. Quite literally you can jam out all day long.

This 38% discount makes buying a second speaker a pretty attractive prospect. Why? Because you can use wireless stereo pairing to connect two Soundcore 2 speakers together. Once paired, you can set the two speakers to listen into a single sound source to play bold stereo sound—or simply to have double the volume. It’s also great to set up in multiple rooms during a house party so every space is synced to the same music.

Your Apple devices are easy to keep track of easy thanks to the Find My app: I’ve used it to locate an iPhone I once left at a restaurant, a MacBook I left at a coffee shop, and even an Apple Watch that fell into a river …. yeah, don’t ask. It’s undeniable how handy the Find My app can be in a crisis — it’s even great for friends to track each other when planning on meeting up in an unfamiliar city. The limitation is you can only track Apple stuff. What about my wallet that has no GPS or chip inside? It sure would be great to be able to use the Find My app with it.

Use the Find My App With More Than Just Apple What’s this now? Yup. The Apple AirTag allows you to do just that. These tiny circles measuring in at just over an inch in diameter can be adhered or slipped into any number of your belongings so you may easily track their location in the Find My app. Stick it on a keychain and never lose your car keys again.

From there, you’ll see it populate in the Find My app along with your other Apple devices.

But let’s say you’ve “lost” your keys. “Lost” as in you know you set them down somewhere in your house, but you just can’t remember where. It’s not super helpful to see the GPS just pinpoint it at your address. For these cases, that’s why each AirTag has a built-in speaker so you can find your stuff when it’s somewhere in your proximity. You can even ask Siri to help you.

Amazon is running deals taking over 30% off the price of the 2TB and 4TB models of the updated SanDisk Extreme Gen 2 portable SSD, bringing the price of the 2TB down to just $136 down from $199 and the 4TB to $247: The 31% price cut on the 4TB model computes out to over $100 in savings off the regular $360 price.

Little Big Drive

External hard drives do not come more portable than the SanDisk Extreme which is just 4 x 2 inches and less than a half inch thick, with a feathery weight of just 0.1 pounds. It’s abundantly pocket-sized, slips easily into a small compartment of a briefcase or backpack, and it has a built-in carabiner loop in case you want to attach it to a belt loop or the outside of a bag for quick access.

The SanDisk Extreme has been one of the top go-to storage solutions for professional photographers and videographers for years, and the updated Gen 2 model makes it even more attractive to creative professionals on the go with upgraded IP65 water and dust resistance, and a 3-meter drop protection rating that’s a full meter greater than the Gen 1 SanDisk Extreme.

Got Your Back

Even if the only adventures you have planned for your SanDisk Extreme will be taking place inside the comfort of your home and at your computer desk, it’s one of the best tools on the market for backing up data on laptops, PCs, and tablets. The SanDisk Extreme has long been known for its reactivity — 1050MB/s read and 1000MB/s write speeds — and its reliability. It’s received over 75,000 Amazon ratings with an average of 4.6 out of 5 stars based on its combination of small size, large capacity, durability, and performance.

That data you add to the SanDisk Extreme is safe not just from accidental drops or water exposure, but also from prying eyes, as SanDisk has built 256-bit AES hardware encryption into the Extreme, with built-in password security.

It’s time to get your digital devices cleaned up and organized, and if you’re still working with an older, heavier, or less-reliable backup drive, Amazon’s sale taking over 30% off the price of the SanDisk Extreme 2TB and 4TB models is an upgrade well worth making.

What seemed a simple logistics fault proved to be part of a systematic theft scheme starring a trusted employee. The finding has generated an impact on the community and questions on the safety of shipments.

An organized plan: luxury, technology and an unexpected suspect

Armando Garcia, 37 and UPS employee during the last five years, was arrested after the authorities discovered more than $ 200,000 in stolen articles in San Benito, Texas. Among the recovered objects were brand bags and accessories such as Louis Vuitton, Dior, Fendi and Ferragamo, as well as iPads, iPhones, smart watches, designer clothing, electric tools and electronic products.

According to Cameron County prosecutor, Luis V. Saenz, the investigation began after a UPS Security report on high -value packages that never reached their destinations. The clues led to the authorities directly to the address of Garcia, where a registration order was executed with the support of agents of the Department of National Security (HSI).

Garcia was arrested at home without resistance and faces multiple charges for robbery.

The impact: broken trust and an ongoing investigation

For prosecutor Saenz, this was not an isolated case or a simple error. In the words of the official:

""It was a deliberate and organized effort to steal merchandise of high value for customers who paid for it. This type of crime not only harms companies, but also affects consumer confidence.""

Saenz also assured that the County will not tolerate robberies of any kind and that its Special Investigations Unit will continue working in collaboration with other agencies to guarantee justice.

For its part, a UPS spokesman expressed in a statement to the media that the company maintains a policy of “zero tolerance” against theft and that they are cooperating completely with the investigation. They also derived any additional questions to the authorities.

Are there more involved? The investigation is still open

Although Garcia was already arrested, the case is not yet closed. The prosecutor's office indicated that ""more suspicious and charges"" are expected as the investigation progresses. This suggests that the employee may not have acted alone and that more people, possibly inside or outside the company, could be arrested.

Meanwhile, local residents and UPS clients who never received their orders could be facing the explanation they expected so much. If a expensive package mysteriously disappeared in recent years, it may not have been a simple system error, but part of a major robbery scheme.

The story continues.

If the inclusion of the journalist in the group that also saw among the participants, the director for national security, the US vice -president and CIA members can be considered a Madorna error, the criticisms of media and observers are also focusing on the opportunity to use a commercial software to exchange sensitive information.

More than simple superficiality, however, in this case it could be a precise strategy dictated by the fear that the traditional ""safe communication"" systems were not so safe. Of course, we are in the field of speculations. On closer inspection, however, the clues to justify such a choice are quite numerous.

Beijing's shadow on US telecommunications

In recent months, in the United States, communications security has become a very delicate theme. More precisely, starting from October 2024, the entire nation coexists with the doubt that it is subject to a mass surveillance system controlled by China. It is at that moment, in fact, that the US authorities announced that they have identified a hacker attack that would have allowed the Salt Typhoon group to infiltrate the computer systems of nine telecommunications including Verizon, AT & T, T-Mobile and Lumen. The Hacker group, considered a direct emanation of the Beijing government, had long been inaccurate access to all mobile telephony systems.

In practice, Salt Typhoon had the opportunity to read any SMS (not encrypted) and record the information relating to any call on the US territory. As if that were not enough, the infiltration in the Made in the US telco had allowed Chinese hackers to access also to the interception systems used by FBI, police forces and federal agencies. In the United States, in fact, these systems are managed (sic!) Directly by telecommunications companies.

According to what emerged later, the Cyber-Spioni of Beijing would also have tried to exploit the systems to intercept the phones of Kamala Harris, J.D. Vance and Donald Trump himself during the election campaign for the presidential elections. The problem is that the case has not been definitively considered as ""resolved"". Because one thing is to notice the presence of a hacker in the systems, another is to have the certainty of having eleminated every backdoor from telecommunications networks.",wired
https://wired.com,"The city of Rome in the first image taken by Pathfinder Heo, the satellite of the Italian constellation Iride",https://www.wired.it/article/pathfinder-heo-prima-immagine-roma-costellazione-italiana-iride-esa-asi/,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 05:50:00 GMT","Pathfinder Heo took his first photo. The eyes of the first satellite of the Iride constellation, the Italian fleet in space, launched last January, have scanned our country diagonally and stopped on Rome, restoring a close image of the eternal city where the Andes of the Tiber and the embrace of the Colonnade of San Pietro are clearly visible, with a spatial resolution of just 2.66 meters. The photo was presented today during an event attended by the main managers of the project, including the European Space Agency (ESA), the Italian Space Agency (ASI) and Argotec, which already has the realization of 25 satellites. ""This first image - explained Simonetta Cheli, director of the observation programs of the land of ASA - show the enormous potential of iris, made possible thanks to the skills and extraordinary motivation of ESA teams, ASI and Italian industry"".

An All Star Team

As we told you, I work a real all -Italian all star team in Iride. It is the most ambitious program of our space research, which promises to be the avant -garde in the observation of the earth. It is and will be made thanks to the resources of the PNRR and will be completed by 2026 under the management of the ESA and with the support of the ASI: in particular, the program has been allocated with a loan of approximately 1.1 billion euros, of which approximately 880 from the national recovery and resilience plan. In addition to the space agencies, over 47 companies in the Italian industrial sector participate in the project, which will build the system and offer services to users, including civil protection, law enforcement agencies and environmental monitoring agencies. Upon operational, the fleet will be made up of six constellations - and that is why we speak of ""a constellation of constellations"" - composed of very different and complementary satellites with each other: brief opening radar tools, very high resolution optical tools, hyperspectral optical tools. All the data that will reveal, together, will provide us with the most complete monitoring of our country. ""This success - commented Teodoro Valente, ASI president - is the result of teamwork that sees Italy protagonist in space. We will continue to work with determination to ensure that this constellation achieves full operational ability, respecting the objectives of the PNRR and providing value data for our country and for the international community"".

Pathfinder Helo, the first of the fleet

The first launched satellite, Pathfinder Helo (acronym for Hawk for Earth Observation) acts as a test for one of the iris constellations, developed by a consortium led by Argotec. Its instrument has a sampling distance from the ground of 2.66 meters, which means that each pixel of the image is equivalent to 2.66 real meters. Not bad, if you take into account that it was taken from an orbital altitude of 590 kilometers. It has a large ghostly capacity: it can in fact acquire images that range in seven different spectral bands, including the nearby infrared.

What we will do

This is the most interesting part. The Iride constellation will serve to generate multispectral optical images which, put together, will be used to monitor the marine and coastal areas of our country, contributing to the protection of the cultural and environmental heritage of the Italian coasts. But not only: the program, in fact, will also provide data for monitoring air quality, soil coverage, climate and water resources, for the mapping of the movements of the soil (due, for example, to volcanoes, earthquakes or subsidence) and for emergency and safety services. And all these services will be made available to various public and local authorities in Italy, providing (among other things) support for urban planning, the monitoring of changes in the cover of the soil and the evaluation of the effects of the urban heat islands.",wired

https://wired.com,"Wild, but not too much. The Sardinian pig between domestication and natural selection",https://www.wired.it/article/maiale-sardo-evoluzione-selezione-naturale-artificiale-studio/,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 05:20:00 GMT","""In Sardinia a type of traditional pastoralism is practiced in which the herds of pigs are left to graze freely in the wild,"" says the professor. ""These animals autonomously procure water and food in the middle of the woods, where it happens that they mate with wild wild boars. They are therefore subjected to the effect of natural selection"".

Also, in fact. But not only. In fact, as Fulgione and Coautori discovered, a partial artificial selection that serves to limit the presence of hybrids born from the crossings with the Sardinian wild wild boars. The purpose of the breeders is in fact to preserve some specific characteristics in their animals, such as docility, the high fat content, the high fertility and the color of the cloak, in addition to the ability to survive in the wild.

""Different practices are adopted to avoid the effects of hybridization,"" continues Fulgione. ""The breeders we met have told us, for example, that the babies with typically"" wild boar ""morphological traits - and therefore probably hybrid - are slaughtered or castrated immediately, to prevent further characteristics linked linked, for example, to the striped color of the cloak. Therefore an artificial selection operate that blocks the gene flow from the wild specimens"".

Similar but different

Fulgione told Wired Italia that he had been particularly intrigued by the existence of this evolutionary line in which human conditioning is almost - but not completely - absent. For this reason, together with his research group, he has collected and crossed historical data, genetic and dealing with observation on the field to distinguish the effects of natural and artificial selection in Sardinian pigs and compare them with pigs from other domestic and hybrid races present in Campania.

Also in this region, as in the rest of southern Italy, the traditional pastoralism of outdoor pigs was practiced for millennia, but only until the 1950s. Then, as Fulgione says, ""industrialization pushed the populations to leave the internal areas to move to the cities. For this reason, many pigs were abandoned to live in the wild in the Apennine countryside, where today the hybrid curious that sometimes keep typically domestic traits, such as the clear patches on the cloak are encountered."" These phenotypic characteristics, explains the professor, will probably tend to disappear over time. ""Unlike Sardinian pigs, these animals in Southern Italy must deal with a natural predator: the wolf"". It is therefore plausible that natural selection will make these hybrids less and less domestic and more capable of escaping predation.",wired
https://wired.com,"A ""tech"" company's challenge to save independent ski resorts from extinction",https://wired.jp/article/sz-can-tech-save-small-ski-resorts-entabeni-systems/,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 22:00:00 GMT","When Morgensen joined the industry with Entabeni in it, he felt that the situation was quite severe. However, he admits that the reality was far more severe than what he imagined. ""It's really a mess. Every ski resort we undertakes is extremely vulnerable and there are so many challenges we need to deal with. Building a future outlook is extremely difficult.""

Whether or not you can survive this

It's probably dependent on technology

The most basic function required of a ski resort is to carry people who want to ski down the slopes up the mountain. In solo ski resorts, most of these lifts were built in 1965, and it costs a huge amount of money to run, maintain and manage them. Among these, it is almost impossible for a small ski resort, especially to make profits in the same way as major groups like Vail and Alterra.

It is Entabeni's job to intervene there. They collect data on skiers' behavior, ski resort operations, sales, and snow machines operation and develop strategies. By obtaining information such as which courses skiers gather most and which courses skiers will head first, the ski resorts can know which snow machines should be running. If we realize that hamburgers and hot dogs are not selling at all at the lodge between 10:45 and 11:45, the kitchen will be able to reduce unnecessary ingredients and run work more efficiently.

Entabeni also plans to introduce a new dedicated app to replace the RFID (contactless IC) card system at Black Mountain starting next season, and is currently in trial operation. With this app, skiers can ride the lift simply by holding their smartphone directly. The RFID card simply reads information that a customer has been on the lift, but with Entabeni's system, by combining the app and software and hardware developed for the app, a system specialized for the ski resort operation can be built, allowing the entire ski resort, including online and local purchasing status.

""No other company has been able to gain control and control of the ski resort at this level,"" Morgensen said. ""We don't have to integrate existing systems. We build the ecosystem itself from scratch.""

Skiing customers become co-owners

Entabeni owns several trucks loaded with technology equipment, and the work is basically done on-site. Morgensen leads his team and drives one of the trucks into the ski resort's parking lot and goes to work. This has the advantage that by first seeing the customer's site firsthand, you can see the necessary information such as the ski resort's ticket system, operation status, and snow machine operation status as visible.

In 2013, Morgensen acquired a season pass system called Indy Pass. This is a pass that can be used across multiple ski resorts - many of whom are already Entabeni customers - and is in some degree in competition with Ikon Pass and Epic Pass, which are sold by major ski resort groups. The acquisition was the first step in Morgensen's strategy to achieve its goals. He believes that in order to successfully migrate skiing and the business that supports it into a more rational and technology-enabled system, three-way approach is necessary.

The third piece of Morgensen's strategy is Black Mountain, New Hampshire's oldest ski resort, which he bought in the fall of 2024. He sent a team of several members to New England from Entabeni's base office in Granby, Colorado. So they are stationed at ticket counters and lodges, and are focusing on improving the software and hardware of the POS system.",wired
https://wired.com,"The number of downloads for the encryption app ""Signal"" has skyrocketed in the US. Focused on the Trump administration's misinformation",https://wired.jp/article/signalgate-is-driving-the-most-us-downloads-of-signal-ever/,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 08:00:00 GMT","It was reported on March 24th (US time) that senior Trump administration officials had mistakenly invited The Atlantic editor-in-chief to a group chat on the crypto messaging app Signal. In the chat, senior officials were planning to bomb Yemen.

The news may be one of the biggest scandals for the Trump administration. For Signal, on the other hand, frequent references to Signal in the news have been the catalyst for the increase in users.

2025 has already been a ""recorded year"" for Signal's growth. This week, with an even greater number of users, marked the week of the US's most downloads in Signal's nearly 11-year history.

""Looking through Signal's history, it's the biggest growth ever in the US,"" said Jun Harada, head of the growth and partnership division at the nonprofit that runs Signal. ""It's a surprising situation for us too,"" he added.

Harada refrained from providing more information than the total number of downloads in Signal's absolute user growth. This number has not changed in several years. But he said the number of users that increased this week is twice the normal week of 2025, twice the normal week of the same period last year.

""This growth has been sustained shortly after The Atlantic published an article about the use of Signal on the Yemen bombing, and we continue to maintain this growth rate every day,"" explains Harada.

Harada says it has been the first time that signals have experienced such a rapid increase since WhatsApp changed its privacy policy in 2021. However, while the number of overseas users increased mainly at that time, this time the movement was clearly centered around the US.

105% increase from the previous week, US users are rapidly increasing

According to market analysis company Sensor Tower, the number of signal downloads in the US increased by 105% compared to the previous week, up 150% compared to the average week in 2024. Outside the US, this is only an increase of 21% from the previous week.

The shocking incident was reported earlier this week when Defence Secretary Pete Hegses, National Intelligence Secretary Tulsi Gabbard, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz and Vice President J.D. Vance were mistakenly added to Signal's group chat, where they were discussing plans to strike the Houthis. Since then, the incident has raised serious questions about the Trump administration's security practices and has continued to stir up a ripple.

The scandal has raised questions about whether senior government officials were planning air strikes using unauthorized or personal devices that are security vulnerable. According to a screenshot from a group chat released by The Atlantic on the 26th, senior officials may have used Signal's message disappearing feature to delete the interaction, which could violate US record keeping laws.

The president's comments raises attention even more

In response to this incident, some have raised doubts about the safety of Signal itself. President Trump also caused controversy on the 26th, saying, ""Signal may be flawed."" However, many security experts recommend Signal, and there is no evidence so far that the app itself was vulnerable.

Signal's Harada declined to respond to Trump's ""flawed"" comment and gave Signal's previous statement. It says no evidence of an app vulnerability, much less evidence of a vulnerability related to Jeffrey Goldberg's mistaken addition to the White House group chat has yet to be found.",wired
https://wired.com,"Elon Musk's xAI acquires X. The future of the two companies is ""intertwined""",https://wired.jp/article/xai-x-acquisition-deal/,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 04:30:00 GMT","xAI, an artificial intelligence (AI) company owned by Elon Musk, has acquired X (formerly Twitter), a social media platform also operated by Musk, through a share exchange. The company's valuation amounted to $33 billion, including liabilities worth $12 billion. The acquisition comes just weeks after Musk raised an additional debt loan for X, reporting that X was valued at $44 billion (as valuation of Musk when he acquired it three years ago).

""The future of xAI and X are intertwined,"" Musk wrote to X. ""Today, we have officially taken a step towards bringing together data, models, computing power, distribution networks and talent. This combination will unlock immense possibilities by combining xAI's sophisticated AI capabilities and expertise with X's enormous reach.""

X's CEO Linda Jaccarino and xAI co-founder Igor Babschkin soon posted similar messages to X, expressing their support for the acquisition. ""The future could not be brighter,"" Jaccarino posted. Musk reposted only Babushkin's posts.

It is unclear whether Jacarino will remain in the same role or what the acquisition will mean for X employees. Musk, Jaccarino and xAI legal team head Robert Kiel did not respond to requests for comment before the publication of this article.

After a major failure, investors are re-interested

Musk acquired Twitter in 2022 and later changed its name to X, receiving billions of dollars in loans from Wall Street banks and other groups of financiers. However, the advertising business slumped after the acquisition, and although the bank tried to sell the loan to other investors, it reportedly struggled to find a buyer.

Lenders (financial institutions) usually try to quickly sell the loans to other investors and remove them from their balance sheet, and earn profits from the sale and fees. The Wall Street Journal called the fiasco ""the worst buyout for a bank since the financial crisis.""

However, X's business situation improved after Donald Trump was re-elected and Musk was appointed to head the so-called ""DOGE."" Advertisers began to return and deepened their ties with Musk and the White House and Trump, making more investors interested in the debt.

According to a report by the Financial Times, Musk had already provided X investors with 25% stake in xAI last year, which increased the value of X and gave lenders even more security.

Until now, it seemed like xAI was just trying to catch up with rivals like OpenAI and Google. However, Mask has given it a great boost by building a huge AI training cluster with over 100,000 NVIDIA GPUs. The supercomputer, named ""Colossus,"" is located in Memphis, Tennessee.

At the time of its founding, xAI's mission was to understand the essence of the universe. It is now known for developing Grok, a chatbot that is ""free of regulations or restrictions."" Grok has been introduced in X as part of the platform since late 2023.",wired
https://wired.com,"The future that connects AI everywhere, the key to the future is ""satellite internet.""",https://wired.jp/article/satellite-internet-will-let-us-put-ai-in-everything/,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Interest in the satellite internet is currently growing. It maintains an important social infrastructure, Internet connection, closes service gaps among residents depending on where they live, and many countries and states have signed contracts with satellite communications service providers. Mobile phone manufacturers have built satellite communications capabilities into their devices, and airlines have partnered with satellite operators to ensure that Netflix can be streamed uninterruptedly on board. And the launch race for satellites to build communication networks in Earth's orbit is playing a major role in the development of the rocket industry.

All of this has helped the satellite internet business to flourish. However, there is another factor that could further accelerate the spread of this technology. It's artificial intelligence (AI).

As always-on-connected companies can expect to see their business expand, the AI ​​industry is eager to realize a ""completely connected world,"" says Unchell Thug, chief analyst at research firm Moor Insights & Strategy. The near future of the AI ​​expansion race is determined by AI agents, clever virtual assistants who can automate all aspects of people's everyday life. However, in order to fully utilize the power of this AI agent, it is necessary to be on-site 24 hours a day, open all year round. In other words, an ""always on"" internet connection is essential. Additionally, keeping up with the rapid technological innovation of AI agents requires frequent tweaks and updates to AI models, which requires direct internet connection.

""We're still as dependent on the cloud as ever because everything is changing so rapidly,"" says Thug. ""If you have an AI model installed on the end device, it is not acceptable to think that regular updates are not necessary.""

The spread of satellite Internet seems to benefit the world of the Internet of Things (IoT), which combines both greatness and imperfection. IoT technologies such as a robot vacuum cleaner that moves around freely, luggage trackers that track the outcome of lost travel bags, and security cameras installed around the property should allow you to bid farewell to your struggles over constant connectivity and send videos, images, commands and location information.

""IoT will become even more important in the future,"" says Thug. ""This is because the widespread use of satellite connections should lead to more feedback from IoT devices to AI.""

If communications satellites are sent to space enough to cover the Earth, and the current locations and movements of various devices on Earth can be reached in real time, AI will likely engulf the vast amount of information, as if invited to a grand feast. Hopefully we can digest that information and produce something useful.

""The reason IoT has been struggling is because no one knows how to use the data,"" Thug looks back on the past decade. ""However, data is a favorite of AI. The more data you give, the more powerful it becomes and the more you can make great decisions.""

Infrastructure through ""Network from the Sky""

Among the main companies in the satellite internet business, Starlink has the biggest presence. The company's solid internet connection services have exceeded 4.5 million people worldwide, with many of them not able to have reliable internet connections without Starlink. Starlink is also a subsidiary of SpaceX, and is run by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. Speaking of Musk, he is a person who is steadily moving forward with plans to reduce the number of government agencies in the United States. Thanks to masks, Starlink's internet service has also been introduced to the White House. It is also true that some potential customers who do not like these political ties are flowing to other companies. Starlink is also causing controversy for other reasons. It has been discovered that a criminal organization that was operating online fraud in Myanmar was using Starlink's services.",wired

When Amazon updated its entire Kindle lineup, that did not exclude the Kindle versions for kids. My kids have tested the Kindle kids’ versions since they came out in 2019, and to my eye, the new Kindle Kids and Kindle Kids Paperwhite are both noticeably faster and clearer than the old versions. If you’re spending all your money buying comic books, I suggest the Kindle Kids Paperwhite, which is bigger and better for reading graphic novels. It’s also waterproof and, like all Amazon kid devices, comes with a two-year worry-free warranty. —Adrienne So

This is the best Amazon tablet for younger children. It has all the same features as Amazon’s standard Fire tablets, but you’ll also get a rugged case and a two-year replacement guarantee. It also comes with a free year of Amazon Kids+, which gives you access to kid-friendly movies, books, apps, and games. You can manage the parental controls on the device as well. —Scott Gilbertson

The main difference between the Fire HD Kids and Fire HD Kids Pro tablets is the protective case. The Pro version has a less protective case and is aimed at older kids less likely to drop it. The Pro version still has the same two-year warranty though, so if it does hit the floor, you’re covered. —Scott Gilbertson

The Fire HD 10 Pro Kid’s Edition is the same as the normal Fire HD 10, but it comes with a handy protective case (with kickstand), one year of Amazon Kids+, and, most importantly, a no-questions-asked warranty for when your kids accidentally drop it. Parental controls on Amazon’s tablets are limited but offer some control over content (see our guide for more details). —Scott Gilbertson

This robotlike alarm clock on wheels rolls away from you, falling from whatever surface you put it on and randomly rolls wherever (under your bed, behind your dresser—all of the hardest places to reach), so you’re forced to physically get out of bed and turn it off. Right now, it’s the lowest price we’ve seen all year. If you’re like me and have slept through a fire alarm, it's a solid way to get you moving in the morning. —Molly Higgins

The Roxicosly clock is one of the most reviewed nontraditional alarm clocks on Amazon. It’s semi-customizable, with the buzzer going up to 106 decibels and a bed shaker that can be used separately or together with the alarm. The vibrations provide a more subtle way to wake up by forgoing the jarring alarm sounds, and the escalating pattern of the buzzing helps ease the snoozer into wakefulness. The vibrations, along with the noise and adjustable intensity, helped me wake up more easily than other buzzing alarms I’ve tried, and at $18, it’s one of the lowest prices we’ve seen for it this year. —Molly Higgins

Tushy makes some of the best budget electric bidets, and the Classic 3.0 is a great choice for any bathroom—renters included—since it’s a small accessory that doesn’t require any additional power and can be added to just about any toilet. For having no electricity added, it’s got impressive water power and a nice range of finishes so you can select the one that best matches your bathroom’s vibe. —Nena Farrell

This excellent cordless vacuum has fallen to $550 before, but it rarely drops below $600 (and doesn’t go on sale super often). It’s the best Dyson for most people, boasting all the features you need (like strong suction, a 60-minute run time, and a few different attachments). It also has a neon green laser that lights up the floor in front of the vacuum head, which can help you spot dust particles that you might’ve missed otherwise. —Louryn Strampe

The Dyson V15s Detect Submarine is one of our favorite Dyson vacuums overall. It’s got a wet roller head and drip tray built in, which makes it both a vacuum and a mop. It can clean about 1,000 square feet on one charge and water tank fill, with up to an hour of run time and around 4.5 hours to recharge the battery. If you want a wet/dry vacuum that isn’t a robot, this is a great deal on Dyson’s offering. —Louryn Strampe

True Classic’s white tee is snug in the right places, and relaxed everywhere else. Editor Jeremy White appreciates the “dad bod” fit and says the neckline is just right. WIRED UK managing editor Mike Dent admits he’d probably wear it to death as pajamas. It is a 60/40 cotton-poly bend, meaning it’s not the most sustainable choice and is more likely to pill. Still, at $25, it’s a solid tee that won’t make you look like an extra in an early aughts music video. —Boutayna Chokrane

I recently wrote an article about how much I love Comfort Colors t-shirts, which are slowly displacing every other t-shirt in my closet. Doing so is not exactly cost-prohibitive at their standard offering price of around $10 on Amazon, but the Big Spring Sale is dropping them a bit. It's like getting a free shirt for every five you buy! —Martin Cizmar

They’re soft. They’re fun. They’re serotonin for your feet. These TikTok-approved smiley slippers are designed with memory foam cushioning, a fuzzy upper, and a nonslip sole for padding inside and outside the house. They’re not the most durable, but for $13, they’ll keep your toes cozy and your mood (hopefully slightly) boosted. —Boutayna Chokrane

Dyson loves to make beautiful, techy-looking, almost self-consciously expensive devices. This is why I’d always recommend waiting for a good sale before buying one. Luckily, this is a doozy, knocking $200 off the list price on one of our favorite portable heaters and fans. This model is basically an all-things-to-all people air-changing doohickey par excellence. The HP07 is a space heater with an energy-saving, accurate thermostat that’ll also work as a fan, an air quality monitor, and an air purifying filter. It’s a little loud if you turn the fan up, but among portable space heaters, it’s also the most sophisticated air management system I’ve tested. —Matthew Korfhage

We are now approaching the great robot vacuum convergence, where all manufacturers agree that somewhere between $500 and $1,000 is the sweet spot for a multifunctional robot vacuum mop. The Eufy X10 Pro Omni was our top pick in this spot last year, but it got edged out by slightly cheaper models; still, at the sale price, this is still a great robot vacuum whose AI navigation helps it map quickly and efficiently (and provides some comic relief in the process). —Adrienne So

Yeedi is the affordable sub-brand of Ecovacs, which also makes many robot vacuums that we like. The company offers a broad array of robot vacuum/mops at a wide range of prices. This one is the midrange model, and I did find that it navigated better than the cheaper versions. There are a few other standout features besides the very good price—the clean/dirty water tanks are absolutely ginormous, so you can go much longer without refilling them, and it has an extendable arm to get in all the little nooks and crannies. —Adrienne So

Tineco makes some great floor cleaning gadgets—I was vacuuming my entire house with the Pure One Station 5 before writing this—including a fantastic carpet cleaner. The Tineco Carpet One Pro is our favorite upgrade-worthy carpet cleaner, but it’s on sale right now for nearly half the price, making it the perfect time to snap one up for yourself. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano describes the Carpet One Pro as as much fun as you can hope from a carpet cleaner, with a clever design that leaves the dirty water tank upright while you maneuver the cleaner and a big LED screen to see what mode you’re in. There’s an Auto, Max, and Drying mode, and it can leave white carpet looking like it’s brand-new. —Nena Farrell

Afina has two main benefits among the new crop of filtered showerheads that promise to filter the chlorine out of the water that reaches your skin and hair. The first is its broad, flat showerhead that offers a lovely, even, spalike spray. The second is that unlike most of the showerheads I tested, Afina works quite well for the entire duration of its filter life. In part, this is because they recommend filter replacement every two months instead of every three months, at $30 a pop. But from our testing, this frequency amounts to a rare honesty. —Matthew Korfhage

After testing more than a dozen filters from a new generation of filtered showerhead brands, I can say this handsome little number from Canopy was one of the very few that could bring my total chlorine down to undetectable levels on my chloramine-treated water system. The filter—a mix of KDF-55, calcium sulfite, and granular activated carbon made from coconut shells—retains about half its efficacy throughout the three-month life of the filter, not a bad record compared to others I’ve tested. What’s more, the thoughtful design offers easy installation, adjustable spray, and even aromatherapy diffusers if that’s your steez. This is almost the lowest price we’ve seen over the past 12 months, and the handheld version is also on sale. —Matthew Korfhage

This family favorite frequently comes out when we have people over because it’s so easy to pick up and play, and it’s fun. Each round is based on a single word from a category card determined by a dice roll, but while everyone else knows the word, the chameleon has to bluff their way through. Each player says something associated with the word for that round, and the guesser has to decide who the chameleon is. It’s for up to eight players but is still fun for spectators. —Simon Hill

If you don’t want to worry about batteries in your smart video doorbell, the Reolink Video Doorbell is a great option that lets you wire it into your home, letting it stay powered on for years to come. Reolink has a simple app, an included chime, plus built-in speakers and a microphone. The camera displays 2K video and records to a microSD card, so you don’t need a cloud storage fee like other doorbells. —Nena Farrell

This body pillow is marketed for pregnant people, but as a non-pregnant person who is an exclusive side sleeper, it worked well for me. The pillow combines popular body- and pregnancy-pillow U and C shapes for a unique shape that provides total-body support no matter which side you sleep on—Momcozy even claims it helps those with pain like sciatica and fibromyalgia. Because of its unique shape that’s got your head and limbs covered, and at less than 40 bucks, this is really the only pillow you’ll need. Insider tip: It comes in multiple cover types, so I’d opt for a lighter cotton fabric cover if you sleep hot. —Molly Higgins

Photograph: Loftie

The Loftie Alarm Clock (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the prettiest bedside gadgets I’ve tried. The sleek alarm clock pairs with an app to let you create your alarms and access a variety of audio content to fall asleep to. There’s even a membership ($6 a month) that gives you access to personalized bedtime stories, meditations, and even your horoscope. There are also plenty of other standard sounds, like white noise and campfires, that you can access without the membership. The Loftie Alarm also has a little nightlight built into it that you can tap on and off, but it is pretty dim so it won’t double as a lamp or bedside light. Overall, it’s a really fun alarm clock, and it pairs with the beautiful Loftie Lamp (sadly not on sale) to become a sunrise alarm setup. —Nena Farrell

This cute little sound machine has a real physical fan inside of it to create the soothing fan noise you can fall asleep to. It only makes the one fan sound, so only get this if you don’t want variety and instead want one good, consistent fan sound. It has a nice fade-in and fade-out feature for timers, too. The only downside is how expensive it is for a single sound, but you can get it cheaper right now. —Nena Farrell

This is my favorite wearable breast pump I’ve ever tried. The Willow Go (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is well priced for a wearable breast pump and works great, and the clear exterior makes it easy to keep an eye on how your pump session is going. It has its own app from Willow, and you can also purchase Willow’s bras that are made to help hold a wearable pump. The pieces are nice and big making it easy to clean without losing something down the drain. It’s a bit of a splurge, though it’s often on sale for $280 (so this is still a better deal than you’d usually find!) —Nena Farrell

This is our budget recommendation in our Best Standing Desks guide. The EN1 has a somewhat complicated assembly but once it’s put together, it’s a reliable and affordable standing desk that does the job. You get four memory presets so that the desk can remember your favorite heights, and it can hold up to 154 pounds. —Julian Chokkattu

I love this tiny table. The frame is designed so that you can roll it under a bed or couch and the desktop will still be easy to access. You can raise it up and down via a lever manually, and the whole thing is on wheels so moving it around is a piece of cake. I’ve been using it for several years as a place for a little photo studio, with clamped-on lights, and it has worked flawlessly. It can hold 15 pounds. —Julian Chokkattu

This little desk accessory comes with magnetic clips you can attach to your cables. Those clips can then stay affixed to the magnetic base, which makes this a neat-freak’s solution to organizing those pesky wires. There’s a bigger version in case you have lots of cables at your desk or nightstand. —Julian Chokkattu

Any ol’ carbonator can carbonate. But this is a carbonator from Ninja, and so this one can’t merely add bubbles. It must also offer multiple levels of carbonation, and infuse your water with functional B-vitamin flavor pods that taste like dragonfruit or watermelon kiwi and promise to “hydrate” or fill you with energy. Anyway, it’s $50 off for the spring sale. And while we did like the SodaStream Enso more, this one costs half as much. —Matthew Korfhage

WIRED contributing reviewer Lisa Wood Shapiro was quite the fan (no pun intended) of this rectangular dehydrator’s fast mode—so much so that she crowned it Best for Those in a Hurry in our guide to the Best Food Dehydrators. It dried apple slices, kiwis, and banana chips in half the time of a typical dehydrator cycle, as viewable through the machine’s large glass window. Lisa was also impressed by its quiet fan and dishwasher-safe stainless steel trays. As the longtime owner of a Nesco dehydrator with infuriatingly difficult-to-clean plastic trays, I can confirm the trays alone make this a worthwhile investment. —Kat Merck

There’s a lot to like about this excellent-value bread machine, top pick in our guide to the Best Bread Makers. It’s got all the same bells and whistles as higher-end models, including 17 preset programs, a delay timer, and a fruit-and-nut dispenser, and it can turn out loaves in three different sizes, as opposed to the usual one or two. Its ceramic pan is free of nonstick coatings and potential PFOAs and can be run through the dishwasher for easy cleaning. The recipe book leaves something to be desired in terms of variety and readability (and quality of the recipes in general—I recommend looking elsewhere online; some KBS-owning Redditors have had success with King Arthur recipes). The stirring/kneading cycle is also louder than it needs to be, but otherwise, this is a worry-free choice if you’re in the market for set-it-and-forget it homemade bread. —Kat Merck

Photograph: Aucma

Look, for sheer performance, we might go with a KitchenAid. But for value, we already recommend this Aucma even at full price. It goes on sale fairly often, but this is a better deal than most on this 1,400-watt device, which boasts useful little features like a splash guard on its tilt head, and basic functions like six speeds and a pulse function. Attachments include whisk, beater, and dough hook, plus a 6-liter and 5-liter bowl. If you just want a mixer that’ll bother some batter, and you don’t want to spend $200-plus on top-line stand mixers and all their elegant frippery, this is your little lower-priced stand mixer workhorse, briefly priced even lower. —Matthew Korfhage

The Breville Smart Oven Pro is the workhorse model in Breville’s lineup of Lexus toaster ovens, hanging out at the sweet spot of affordability and execution. It’s one I’ll recommend to those who want a Breville oven but balk at the price of the top-pick Joule: It heats evenly, keeps temperature beautifully, and offers a standard array of baking, toasting, broiling, and light convection that nonetheless definitely is not air frying. The slight curve in its geometry means you can fit a 13-inch pizza pan inside, a 5-quart Dutch oven, or a 12-by-12 square pan. Anyway, Breville doles out sales sparingly, and this little corker is $50 off for the spring sale. —Matthew Korfhage

This little countertop pizza oven made the rounds on TikTok last year for being so cute, compact, and relatively affordable. Astonishingly, its claims of heating to 800 degrees Fahrenheit on the top and bottom heating element are accurate and it takes about 15 minutes! The top heating element doesn’t cover the whole pizza and it loses heat very quickly, since it opens like a waffle maker. Still, this is a nice housewarming present for a pizza lover. I also use it to heat up tortillas and pitas for dinner. —Adrienne So

Photograph: Aeropress

It’s not a secret: AeroPress is the best and easiest and most lovely coffee maker that can fit in a literal pocket, assuming you’ve got deep pockets. The original version is already the default option for countless hotel room and campsite self-caffeinators. The newer Go travel version is even more lightweight, self-contained, and remains beautifully customizable to your own perfect taste. For now, it’s quite a bit cheaper: more than a third off the list price. —Matthew Korfhage

This stainless steel beauty goes on sale reasonably often, but this is still a great deal on a handsome stainless steel French press that forgoes both microplastics and frangible glass (whose shards shall henceforth be referred to as micro-glass.) I’ve been hunting down non-plastic alternatives for pretty much everything in my kitchen: With everything made of steel right down to the coffee maker filters, Mueller is a strong entrant on my list, and WIRED’s favorite pick among stainless steel French press. —Matthew Korfhage

I found these ramekins to be supremely helpful while testing meal kits for work. You see TV chefs using tiny ramekins and bowls all the time, and as it turns out, they know what they’re doing. Whipping up a compound butter? Tiny bowls! Zesting a lemon before juicing it? Tiny bowls. Separating the white and green halves of a green onion? Tiny. Bowls. They’re also handy when baking individual desserts, such as the lava cakes my partner became obsessed with last year. Get some tiny bowls! —Louryn Strampe

The Instant Pot Vortex Plus is the best air fryer we’ve tried. This usually sells for between $140 and $90, and we’ve only seen it drop below this price a few times before. It keeps temperature precisely and it manages to crisp up food without stripping away moisture. The basket preheats quickly and the simple display is intuitive. Reviewer Matthew Korfhage also appreciated the fact that the controls don’t beep—the simple dial keeps things quiet.

This consistently popular hair-straightening comb was not the answer for members of our team with super thick and curly hair, but for those whose hair is easy to straighten or simply wavy, it’s definitely worth considering for the price and ease of use. The outer shell that covers the hot teeth is safer than a traditional flat iron and enables users to get closer to their roots than they would otherwise, which is great for tamping down flyaways. The brush is also reasonably lightweight at under 1 pound, in case you’d want to use it for travel. Also note that it comes with a black-and-pink heat-resistant glove, which apparently is to use on your hair and not actually on the tool, as former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano found out the hard way. —Kat Merck

This is the original “upgrade” hair straightener that changed the flat iron game for many (including myself) when it was released in 2006, and it’s still going strong today. Former WIRED contributor Victoria Woollaston-Webber tried it for our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners and says it still lives up to the hype. It only heats to 392 degrees Fahrenheit, but it does so in seconds and requires minimal passes. Woollaston-Webber says the outer plastic does get hot while styling, so it may not be the best pick for younger users, but if that doesn’t bother you this is still the best deal on a solid hair straightener you’ll find for $50. —Kat Merck

The Aquasonic Black Series is not for the weak-gummed. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano found the vibrations a little overwhelming—the whole body buzzes more than the bristles themselves. But if you love that ultra-deep-clean sensation, this is a steal at $30. Plus, you get eight replacement heads, which would cost more than the brush itself with some brands. If you’d prefer a gentler toothbrush, you might be better off with a Sonicare or Bitvae, which are also on sale. —Boutayna Chokrane

The Tymo Airflow is a great two-in-one tool, letting you both curl and straighten your hair with the same device. I love it for my fine hair, and I think it shines best as a straightener, though it can do some nice soft curls. There’s 3D floating plates, a ceramic finish, and a rounded form factor that makes it look like a curler, but opens up like a straightener. There’s five heat options ranging from 284 to 428 degrees Fahrenheit, and Tymo has a guide on which to choose based on your hair type. —Nena Farrell

Photograph: Philips

If oscillating toothbrushes feel too intense on your gums, the Philips Sonicare 4100 Electric Toothbrush is a gentler powerhouse. You get a pressure sensor that reduces vibrations when you’re brushing too hard, a two-minute timer, and two intensity settings (low and high). A single charge lasts about two weeks, and it’s designed with BrushSync technology that tracks how long (and hard) you’ve been brushing and will remind you when it’s time to replace the head. Normally $50—now $40—this is the best midrange electric toothbrush we’ve tested. —Boutayna Chokrane

If you’re still scraping your tongue with your toothbrush, it’s time for MasterMedi Tongue Scraper. This stainless steel scraper is way more effective, easier to clean, and won’t snap in half like plastic versions. This two-pack comes with individual cases (one for home, one for your travel kit). While it’s technically dishwasher-safe, just rinse it like an adult. At $8, it’s a small price to pay for a fresher mouth. —Boutayna Chokrane

Manscaped is more famous for its groin-taming Lawn Mower trimmer, but never-nudes take heart: You can keep it above the neck with a Beard Hedger whose small stainless steel teeth and high RPMs make it great for shorter beards, according to WIRED contributing reviewer Andrew Williams. A small amount of give in the trimmer’s plastic guide means the Hedger offers a quite close shave. While this isn’t the lowest price we’ve seen, 25 percent off is a solid deal on this trimmer. —Matthew Korfhage

The Fancii Abigail (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is my favorite lighted makeup mirror for traveling. It measures nearly 8 inches across and it’s easy to transport in a backpack or weekender. Unfurl the flat disc to reveal a mirror that can be used compact-style or raised up on a stand and angled all sorts of directions. The ring light around the mirror is bright, but it doesn’t take up too much of the reflective surface, and there are three light temperature settings to choose from. The interface is simple and the mirror stays closed reliably. It also recharges pretty quickly via USB-C, and the battery lasts for about 10 hours on one charge. If you’re frequently applying your makeup on the go, or you’re sick of terrible hotel bathroom lighting ruining your glam, this price is too good to pass up (in my personal and very experienced opinion). —Louryn Strampe

If TikTok’s raving about it, I’m skeptical, but experts back this trend up. Snail mucin is packed with glycoproteins and hyaluronic acid—but don’t expect overnight miracles. This gooey essence hydrates, soothes, and leaves skin looking plump without feeling greasy. I slather on the Cosrx Advanced Snail Mucin 96 Percent Power Repairing Essence Serum nightly after cleansing. At $18, it’s a decent time to snag a bottle or stock up, though we’ve seen the price dip lower before. —Boutayna Chokrane

These cute little stars that went viral on TikTok are hydrocolloid patches that can help heal pimples. The material attracts water, which helps flatten zits and suck out all the gross stuff inside them. It’s weirdly satisfying to use them, and it’s also empowering, transforming a blemish into an accessory. Pimple patches are usually affordable. The reason I personally like and use Starface patches is because they come in a cute storage case with a little mirror, which helps when I feel hormonal acne cropping up while I’m out and about. Refills are affordable, too. —Louryn Strampe

Micellar water is a godsend for those people who are sometimes too lazy to fully wash their faces at night. (It’s me, I’m people.) Simply douse a cotton pad with this magical solution and swipe it over your face for easy makeup removal and a cleaner feeling than oil-based makeup wipes can provide. I especially like using this sensitive-skin formula for travel since I don’t have to rinse my face after using it, making it ideal for camping trips or overnight car rides. I first received it in a beauty box, but it’s affordable and easy to find (and I don’t have to pour my fancy cleanser into a TSA-approved bottle, either). —Louryn Strampe

I admit I had never before seen or heard of Electrolit until a recent family summer vacation in Las Vegas, when my husband, son, and I made the ill-fated decision to walk the entirety of the Strip during a 115-degree-Fahrenheit heat wave. The Pedialyte-looking bottle was an immediate grab from the cooler at Target, and not only tasted like fruit punch, it quite literally saved my life. The powdered packets taste similar, if not a bit stronger, with vivid hues from artificial food coloring. The company has been around for more than 70 years—before Liquid IV, before even Pedialyte—so if you’re looking for an electrolyte beverage that both looks and tastes like the ’80s, this is your chance to score a great deal on an eight-pack. —Kat Merck

This topped our list of the Best Smart Scales. It quickly and accurately assesses not only your weight but your heart rate, fat and muscle measurements, vascular age, and more. The companion smartphone app is also easy to use. The scale can track data for up to eight users, and the AAA batteries last for over a year. If you’re trying to keep an eye on how your body changes over time, this scale is an investment worth considering. —Louryn Strampe

If you’ve been eyeing a Theragun but can’t stomach the price tag, a massage gun under $50 is almost unheard of. The LifePro Sonic also comes with an absurd number of attachments (eight): a round head for sore muscles, a shovel for back pain, a flat tip for a deep tissue massage, a pointer for sensitive knots, a bullet for small muscles, a fingertip for trigger points, spinal for lower back, and a textured tip for larger muscles. It’s not the lightest at 2.5 pounds, but for the price, this tool is an excellent addition to your gym setup or post-workout recovery routine. —Boutayna Chokrane

The Google Pixel 9 Pro (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite Android phones, and this deal is one of the best prices we’ve tracked so far. This super-smart smartphone is packed with a spate of AI features that make your day-to-day life easier—including Direct My Call (which helps you navigate automated menu options), a ton of photo editing tools, Circle to Search, and more. The Pixel 9 Pro has an excellent camera, plus a vapor-chamber cooling system that helps dissipate heat better than other phones we’ve tried (and other phones in the Pixel 9 lineup). The phone will get software upgrades for seven years. Don’t forget a case! —Louryn Strampe

The Nubia Redmagic 10 Pro (7/10, WIRED Review) is a mobile gaming beast with excellent battery life, silky performance, and a lovely 6.8-inch screen with a 144-Hz refresh rate. Relatively affordable for a phone with the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, this device is all about gaming and includes a built-in fan to keep cool, programmable buttons, and highly customizable gaming software. Shoddy software, limited updates, and an inconsistent camera are downsides, but this is real value for gamers, especially at the discounted price. —Simon Hill

The best smart display to invest in isn’t technically a smart display, but a tablet. The Google Pixel Tablet (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is an Android tablet with a speaker docking station, letting it transform into a powerful little smart display when you aren’t using the tablet. It’s got good performance, a sharp LCD screen, and robust speakers. Both the tablet with the docking station and the tablet alone are on sale, but this tablet really shines when you’re able to use it all day long. It’s a better deal for the included speaker, too, versus the tablet alone. The Google Pixel has been running my smart home devices for months, and I have no desire to go back to a smart-display-only gadget in my house. —Nena Farrell

This is our favorite ultrathin case in our guide to the Best iPhone 16 cases. It’s composed of 100 percent biodegradable packaging with a woven aramid fiber that adds a super soft feel. Despite its thin design, it comes with MagSafe built in, too. It also comes in some fun patterns. It’s worth noting the buttons are exposed, so if that’s a concern, I suggest going for another case. This one will keep the back of your phone safe from scratches, but it won’t do much to protect your display if you drop it. —Brenda Stolyar

It has occasionally dipped a little lower, but this is a solid price on Samsung’s latest smartwatch. It’s best paired with a Samsung phone to access a few extra features, like the electrocardiogram and FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection, but will otherwise work with all Android phones. Performance is smooth, the health tracking is excellent, but battery life is a little annoying—it’ll just about enough to get through a day, not much more. I recommend grabbing the 44-mm variant; it’s a bit bigger but that means better battery life. —Julian Chokkattu

Testing Google’s Pixel Watch 3 is the first time I believed editor Julian Chokkattu when he said “round is better than square.” It’s one of the best-looking smartwatches and one of the best-looking fitness trackers for anyone with an Android phone. I recommend staying with this larger 45-mm model for better battery life, especially if you work out a lot. I have mixed feelings about the AI coaching features, but Fitbit is still one of the best fitness platforms available and Google’s integration with it is virtually perfect. —Adrienne So

Want a big, premium smartwatch for your Android phone? Samsung’s Galaxy Watch Ultra (7/10, WIRED Review) is the Apple Watch Ultra equivalent, with a beefy screen and battery. It has better navigational features like Track Back and a compass to accurately find your way back to camp, and you get two days of battery life—extendable if you turn on power saving mode. You can even submerge it up to 100 meters. —Julian Chokkattu

This tiny little 1080p projector from XGIMI is one of my favorite portable projectors because it’s so easy to set up. You can get a battery-impregnated stand and plug it straight into the projector, which is about the size and shape of a Stanley water cup. It has a cute little speaker on the bottom and can even flip up to shoot images at the ceiling, which makes it fun to add ambience when you’re not watching shows and movies. —Parker Hall

Beats took its time renewing its popular Pill Bluetooth speaker, but the wait was worth it. The latest Pill (8/10, WIRED Recommends) offers a posh design, great sound, and loads of features, from solid water resistance to a USB-C input for lossless audio playback. Its zippy sound signature goes heavy on the bass and treble but both are presented with care and musicality, and its mix of keen instrumental textures and stereo separation place it among the top performers in its class. The Pill’s stylish frame isn’t as drop-friendly as rivals from JBL or UE, but at $100 this is an easy decision for anyone eyeing a solid Bluetooth buddy. —Ryan Waniata

These perfectly sized speakers will bring a rich, clear sound to your desktop. They come in black or white with angled stands to fire the audio into your ears. Our current pick of the best computer speakers under $200, the M60 speakers are already a bargain, so this discount makes them irresistible for anyone in the market. While they offer decent bass, it can get a bit muddy, and the touch controls are slightly annoying, but that’s it for weaknesses. Connectivity choices include USB-C (which will be best for most folks), 3.5 mm, or Bluetooth 5.3. —Simon Hill

Ultimate Ears’ Megaboom is my favorite big-boy speaker. Its larger size means it’s not the easiest to throw in a backpack, but it is up for any adventure thanks to a drop- and weather-proof frame and great sound. I like Ultimate Ears’ app that lets you customize speaker options like an alarm or the ability to wake the speaker from sleep right from your phone. The sound is powerful and full, with plenty of detail, and the playtime of up to 20 hours should keep you jamming in all but the most extended excursions. This speaker sees regular sales, sometimes below this price, but if you’re ready to grab your next patio companion now’s a good time. —Ryan Waniata

The Everboom is a solid offering from Ultimate Ears, one of our favorite Bluetooth speaker makers. The only real issue I took with the speaker in my Everboom review is that its sound quality and features are remarkably similar to the Megaboom 4, which costs $50 less. Issue resolved! If you’re looking for a powerful and uniquely designed Bluetooth speaker with loads of extras to pump up your outdoor jams, at $200 or less the Everboom is a solid choice. —Ryan Waniata

This isn’t a sale so much as the new regular price, but anytime you can get this speaker at $60 or less it’s well worth considering. I like its smooth and warm sound that pays good attention to detail. I love its ultra-portable design that easily clips to shower attachments, branches, belt loops, etc. The Clip is durable and its IP67 dust and water resistance means it works easily as well as a shower speaker or chilling at the beach. —Ryan Waniata

These cheap buds from Nothing are some of our favorite earbuds under $100. They have excellent design; a comfortable, Airpods Pro-like fit; and quality sound and noise canceling technology. If you’re after a pair that look good and that you don’t need to worry about, start here. —Parker Hall

If you own an Android phone, this is a fantastic pair of cheap earbuds (8/10, WIRED Recommends) to pair with it. They quick-pair to all Android devices, and they have a super comfortable and stable design that will keep them in your ears even during the most strenuous workouts. I also like the charging case, which is a cute little egg that slides easily into pockets and bags. —Parker Hall

Soundcore’s Liberty 4 NC (8/10, WIRED Recommends) aren’t just another AirPods clone. They’re another AirPods Pro clone, and a good one at that, offering excellent battery life, clear and detailed sound, and tons of customization options at a fraction of what you’ll pay for Apple’s best buds. You’re not getting Apple’s exclusive features, of course, but if you want a great experience with stem-style buds for less, this is one of my favorite pairs. The customization in Soundcore’s app alone is nearly worth the entry fee, and the buds themselves are well-built and comfy. I had a few problems with the touch controls, but otherwise it’s hard to criticize buds that rise above their price point in nearly every way that counts. —Ryan Waniata

Sony WH-1000MX5 Photograph: Sony

We see this discount frequently, but we’d be remiss not to include it here since it’s the best deal we see for the best headphones we’ve tried. Of the dozens, if not hundreds, of pairs of headphones our reviewers have tested, the WH-1000XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) take the cake in terms of battery life (30 hours), sound quality (thanks to Sony processing and 30-mm drivers), and noise cancelation (complete with automatic audio pausing).—Louryn Strampe

The Pixel Buds Pro 2 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are the best wireless earbuds for Android owners. They’re small and cute, with a supremely comfortable fit and fantastic noise canceling. The battery lasts for eight hours and the sound quality is great, too. They even have IP54 water resistance, so you can take ’em to the gym. It’s not hard to find a good inexpensive pair of earbuds these days, but we don’t see these go on sale very often, making now a better time to pick them up.—Louryn Strampe

I’ve said it before and I’ll say it many times again, I’m sure: Anker’s Soundcore line makes a mean budget headphone. The Space A40 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) noise-canceling buds are longtime favorites for their mix of clear and full sound, solid mid-tier noise cancelation, and plenty of features rolled into a comfy design. The biggest argument against these buds is their lack of auto-pause, which means you’ll need to stay on your toes when you pull a bud out during your favorite true crime podcast. Otherwise, it’s hard to argue against their value, especially since their price has sunk like a stone to nearly half their original MSRP. —Ryan Waniata

A sale on the Life Q30 is really just doubling down on value. Even at full price, these rank among the best noise-canceling headphones I’ve tested for the money. Along with solid noise canceling, highlights include a comfy design, a great companion app, and up to 40 hours of playtime. I’ve taken these headphones on a cross-country flight and had no trouble enjoying my favorite music and movies thanks to their ability to quell engine drone and background noise. The soft plastic tends to scratch easily and they don’t have all the features of top models like the Bose QC Ultra (9/10, WIRED Recommends) or Sony XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends), but at a fraction of the cost, they’re a guilt-free budget buy. —Ryan Waniata

This is a less exciting deal now that the new Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 have come out. But if you’re an Apple user who doesn’t want to spend $250, then Beats’ previous headphones topped our Best Workout Headphones guide for years. (When they were released, we even called them “Apple’s best earbuds ever.”) They’re insanely comfortable, have great battery life and an excellent sound signature, work well with all Apple devices, and despite a modest IPX4 rating, are hardy and durable. I dunked my head under a hose at full blast while wearing them and they were fine. —Adrienne So

If I had to buy my own workout headphones instead of testing them, I would probably buy a pair of the Shokz OpenRuns in any of the company’s models, whether it’s this, the original OpenRun, or the OpenRun mini, for people who have smaller necks. These headphones are just leagues away in terms of build and sound quality than the other competitors of this type, they fit under a helmet for biking and skateboarding, and the newest version has USB-C charging so you don’t have to hunt for that dumb proprietary cable anymore. —Adrienne So

If you work out in a busy city, or you’re cycling to work and need to hear the cars on the road around you, open bone-conduction headphones like the OpenRun Pro are a good option that allow you to still enjoy your tunes. This is an older model from 2022 (8/10, WIRED Recommends), but it still works great for most folks, especially at this discounted price. —Parker Hall

Bose isn’t in the business of making the second-best noise-canceling headphones. When it comes to crushing your sonic annoyances to a pulp, nobody beats the QC Ultra (9/10, WIRED Recommends). These headphones offer rich and clear sound, plush comfort in a posh design, and the best noise canceling you can get for your money. Whether transforming traffic to a whisper or dialing back irksome vocal chatter and even barking dogs, the QC Ultra are the best we’ve tested with a price tag to match. They even offer extras like a transparency mode limiter to keep loud noises from hurting your ears. This is one of the better QC Ultra sales we’ve seen, so if you’re ready to enjoy the silence Depeche Mode style, now’s a good time. —Ryan Waniata

The Studio Buds Plus were among the first earbuds to show Beats had truly turned the corner on a new audio era. They’re not the best noise-canceling buds around but they’ve got a cool look, solid performance, and a handy swath of features for both Android and Apple phones. Maybe most notable is their dial design which makes the buds incredibly easy to insert and control, both real-life conveniences that often get overlooked by reviewers and buyers alike. I wouldn’t suggest you buy the Studio Plus at full price these days, but they’re usually on sale well below their retail cost and right now they're particularly tempting. —Ryan Waniata

This is one of my favorite AirPods cases, specifically because it comes with magnets that support MagSafe accessories. Of course, it’s protective too, with a shock-absorbing hard shell along with top and bottom pieces that shut via magnets (which helps keep the lid from accidentally sliding off). It’s bulkier than other cases I’ve used, but it’s not enough to be a deal-breaker. It also comes in a really cute pink color. It’s compatible with AirPods Pro (1st and 2nd generation) and AirPods (4th generation) —Brenda Stolyar

The Chom Chom roller is like a thing of magic. Half of us on the Gear desk swear by it. The viral TikTok gadget crushes fur and lint like nothing else. Simply pass it over a surface a few times, back and forth, and be amazed at how quickly and thoroughly it gets rid of pet fur. It’s easy to empty, too. Press the button on the back side of the roller and get rid of the fur inside. It’s infinitely reusable—I’ve owned one for nearly six years and it’s still going strong. I like to keep it on the coffee table so I can quickly de-fluff my furniture if guests pop by—because we all know I’m not going to be kicking my cat off the sofa. (She especially knows this.) —Louryn Strampe

This cat DNA test is one of our favorite pieces of cat gear you can buy. Technically, all cats are polycats, but I thought it was neat to see the primary species markers that my cat Luna carries since she adopted me off the street. This test also checks your cat’s DNA against over 100 feline health markers, testing for risk levels regarding kidney health, cardiovascular conditions, and more. It’s not as comprehensive as a human DNA test, but I have zero regrets. —Louryn Strampe

A top pick in our guide to the Best Cat Water Fountains, this 2.4-liter model with a stainless steel bowl pumps water through a cheery plastic daisy. (It does make an audible splashing noise if the water level dips below the reservoir midpoint, but you get used to it.) The center of the flower comes out for faster water flow, or remove it altogether if your cat would rather drink from a lower, springlike burble. The inside is lit by a blue LED so you can see the water level at all times, and refills of the cotton-carbon-resin filters are easy to find and reasonable at a little over $1 each. Inexpensive fountains like this are usually hit or miss in terms of quality, but this one has been going strong in our long-term testing for over three months. —Kat Merck

The Petkit PuraMax 2 is my second-favorite automatic litter box. With this box, owners can monitor cats’ usage through an app, and the box cleans litter via rotation, using a grate system to separate the waste from the clean litter (when it's time to refill with clean litter, the box rotates so the hole is on top for easier filling). This box has triple odor control, with a sealed waste bin; an odor eliminator attachment that sits in the waste bin; and a smart, citrusy deodorizing spray that goes off after every cleaning and randomly throughout the day to ensure the litter box stays fresh. Not only does this litter box smell neutral, dare I say it smells … good? At $430, this is the lowest price we’ve ever seen it. But I’d argue that never having to scoop dirty litter again is priceless. —Molly Higgins

This is my top pick for Cat Water Fountains because it's reliable, safe, and easy to clean with a cordless pump. The basin sits on a dock, the stainless steel bowl snaps on top of the basin for easy cleaning and refilling, and the basin holds 130 milliliters in the bowl at all times in case of power outage. The fountain also has a low-water detection system, automatically stopping if water levels get too low. The connected app records when your cat drank, how much they drank, and for how long. This is the automatic fountain I recommend to people, and at $40, this is generally the lowest we see the price drop. —Molly Higgins

This cat water fountain became one of my top choices because my cats were obsessed with it. This automatic fountain can be either cordless or battery-powered, lasting up to 83 days using only the battery. The app logs every time a pet drinks and compares it over time to determine whether your cat’s drinking habits have changed, and the app also keeps track of when the filter needs replacing and when you need to refill the water. The water flow can be standard flow, intermittent (three minutes on and off), or battery (where the water flow time and sleeping mode time are fully customizable), or you can pause the water flow altogether and just use the basin reserve. —Molly Higgins

This fountain is super helpful for people who have pets with health issues. Using a collar tag to monitor which cat is using the device and for how long, you can compare and track health data (for up to five pets). The Petlibro app alerts you when your pet's consumption is down or up, and you can set hydration goals, which the app will let you know have been met or not. This automatic fountain is especially useful for pet parents of elderly male cats or those who have had health issues with UTIs to more easily monitor and track changes. We’ve seen the price dip lower, but at 20 bucks off, this is a good investment to make to save you costly vet bills and encourage water-drinking. —Molly Higgins

This circular automatic fountain connects to an app to monitor water levels and remind you when it’s time to change the filter and refill, and has a wireless pump that pushes water from the basin into the top lip, circulating continuously. The top part also has a small reservoir that keeps 60 milliliters of water in the tray at all times, ensuring your kitty always has access to water. It has a circular filter, and the pump also has a foam filter and UV light to further sterilize water by killing potentially harmful bacteria. For a little over 50 bucks, this is a solid investment in your cats’ well-being. —Molly Higgins

I cannot tell you how much I love this automatic feeder. The built-in camera gives me so much peace of mind when I’m away. The camera also has night vision so you can watch and hear your pet 24/7, and you can even communicate with them via speaker. It's controlled via an app and dispenses food from its 5-liter capacity based on the feeding schedule you create. The app is easy to use with extremely customizable feeding plans with meals that you label individually. Now on sale for around $100, this savvy little device reliably feeds my cats daily and doubles as a security cam when I’m away. —Molly Higgins

Photograph: Molly Higgins

I deemed this automatic litter box “Best for Helicopter Parents” (8/10 WIRED Recommends) because it doubles as both a livestream of your cat’s goings-on inside the litter box and a security cam on the outside. This is the lowest price we’ve ever seen, at $200 off. Using a camera and AI technology, the litter box identifies which cat used the box (and you can view your cat’s stool to help more closely monitor their health), while the app logs and monitors usage—including the number of times used and the average duration. Although a little pricey, an automatic litter box is a game-changing investment—especially since it’s below a thousand dollars right now. —Molly Higgins

As we’ve found in almost a year of testing for our guide to the Best Smart Bird Feeders, there are no problem-free smart bird feeders (yet)—every model we’ve tested has had at least some issues, whether with connectivity, app user-friendliness, or quality of the cameras or body casing. With that in mind, this feeder has fewer issues than most, especially when considering value, features, and reliability. The AI isn’t perfect and requires a subscription and the auxiliary solar panel is finicky, but the IP65-rated plastic body makes it easy to clean, the 1080p camera is solid for the price, and it offers color night vision. Just be forewarned that it only works on 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, and the included strap won’t work with most trees, so be prepared to use the bracket mount. —Kat Merck

Despite poor AI identification performance and a middling app, I quite liked the reliability and easy setup of this Honorable Mention-earning smart bird feeder. Many of the features users expect (like the ability to take video) require a subscription to unlock, but this is one of the rare budget smart feeder cameras that offers lighted night vision, and birds really seem to like the feeder itself, whether due to its color, extended perch, or generous (2L) seed capacity. Longer-term testing also found it to hold up well to heavy and/or persistent squirrels. —Kat Merck

The latest hummingbird feeder from Netvue subsidiary Birdfy, maker of our favorite Smart Bird Feeder, this 20-ounce model features dual cameras (one front, one side) with impressive 2K resolution and HD video. Both camera views are shown split-screen in Birdfy’s easy-to-use app, and I quite enjoyed watching the various angles of hummingbirds who came to graze at the feeder’s trio of red plastic flowers. That is, while the feeder was working. Our test unit is now defunct due to a faulty sensor, but reviews throughout the internet indicate this was likely an anomaly. —Kat Merck

The Repel Umbrella is sturdy, capable of handling high winds, and has good coverage when it’s open. There’s also a single button that opens and collapses the fiberglass ribs (it collapses down to just a foot in length too). You’ll have your choice among a variety of stunning colors, too. Our only gripe is that it’s tough to close and requires two hands. Your other option is to use the ground as leverage and push the handle down. —Brenda Stolyar

If you’re shopping for a compact and powerful flashlight for late-night walks or emergency kits, this is a solid pick at $25. The Anker Bolder LC90 blasts 900 lumens, enough to temporarily disorient a threat, and it even has a strobe mode for extra deterrence. Unlike pepper spray or mace, there’s no risk of accidentally blinding yourself, and if the threat turns out to be a non-threat, no harm is done. It’s rechargeable, water-resistant, and small enough to toss into a tote bag. —Boutayna Chokrane

Olight makes our favorite flashlight, the Arkfeld Pro, which is on sale for $25 off right now. But the baby of the lineup, the teeny but powerful Baton4 is the model on the biggest sale. This baby light can easily tuck into your pocket and provide a blast of light when needed and recharges easily on the brand's magnetic disc system. It boasts 1300 lumens, and even half of that is bright enough. —Martin Cizmar

https://wired.com,US Cities Seeking to Ban Natural Gas in New Buildings Just Got a Big Win in Court,https://wired.com/story/us-cities-seeking-to-ban-natural-gas-in-new-buildings-just-got-a-big-win-in-court/,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 11:00:00 GMT","This story originally appeared on Grist and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

Cities looking to eliminate fossil fuels in buildings have notched a decisive court victory. Last week, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit brought by plumbing and building trade groups against a New York City ban on natural gas in new buildings. The decision is the first to explicitly disagree with a previous ruling that struck down Berkeley, California’s first-in-the-nation gas ban. That order, issued by the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in 2023 and upheld again last year, prompted cities across the country to withdraw or delay laws modeled after the Berkeley ordinance.

While New York City’s law functions differently from Berkeley’s, legal experts say that this month’s decision provides strong legal footing for all types of local policies to phase out gas in buildings—and could encourage cities to once again take ambitious action.

“It’s a clear win in that regard, because the 9th Circuit decision has had a really chilling effect on local governments,” said Amy Turner, director of the Cities Climate Law Initiative at Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. “Now there’s something else to point to, and a good reason for hope for local governments that may have back-burnered their building electrification plans to bring those to the forefront again.”

In 2021, New York City adopted Local Law 154, which sets an air emissions limit for indoor combustion of fuels within new buildings. Under the law, the burning of “any substance that emits 25 kilograms or more of carbon dioxide per million British thermal units of energy” is prohibited. That standard effectively bans gas-burning stoves, furnaces, and water heaters, and any other fossil-fuel powered appliances. Instead, real estate developers have to install electric appliances, like induction stoves and heat pumps. The policy went into effect in 2024 for buildings under seven stories, and will apply to taller buildings starting in 2027.

Berkeley’s law, on the other hand, banned the installation of gas piping in new construction. The first-of-its-kind policy was passed in 2019 and inspired nearly a hundred local governments across the country to introduce similar laws. But the ordinance quickly faced a lawsuit by the California Restaurant Association, which argued that gas stoves were essential for the food service industry. In April 2023, the 9th Circuit court ruled in favor of the restaurant industry, holding that federal energy efficiency standards preempted Berkeley’s policy. In January 2024, a petition by the city of Berkeley to rehear the case on the 9th Circuit was denied.",wired
https://wired.com,"Google Discontinues Nest Protect, and Apple’s WWDC Gets a Date—Here’s Your Gear News of the Week",https://wired.com/story/google-discontinues-nest-protect-and-apples-wwdc-gets-a-date-heres-your-gear-news-of-the-week/,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 10:00:00 GMT","Google is giving its smart-home range a shake-up, and is discontinuing two of its products to replace them with third-party collaborations. That means, after 12 years, it's time to say goodbye to the Nest Protect Smoke & CO Alarm, and it's also ending production of the Nest x Yale Lock, a smart lock that debuted in 2018.

The Nest Protect's replacement comes from First Alert, a well-established player in the smoke detector space. Arriving in the coming months for $130 and available for preorder now, the First Alert Smart Smoke & Carbon Monoxide Alarm will offer safety voice alerts, safety checkups, and the ability to silence alarms from the app.

It'll connect with existing Nest Protect devices, so if you have one, you can still install the First Alert system in another spot, and if a fire is detected, both units will sound the alarm. Just like the Protect, it can be set up and controlled through the Google Home app.

Photograph: First Alert; Yale

The Nest x Yale Lock replacement is the Yale Smart Lock with Matter—with no Nest branding at all, though it is “designed for Google Home” and meant to complement Google's Nest Video Doorbell. Yale claims it's easy to install, sports 12 months of battery life, has multiple unlocking positions (like an entry code, app, or key), and will be integrated into the Google Home app. It's also Matter-certified, meaning you should be able to easily connect it with other smart home platforms. It arrives this summer.

Both of Google's discontinued products will keep receiving security updates (Nest Protect will continue working through its expiration dates), and you'll still be able to purchase them at retailers while supplies last.

Apple’s WWDC Gets a Date

Mark your calendars. Apple has officially confirmed its annual Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) will start on June 9, with an in-person event and live-streamed keynote. This is where we’ll see new software capabilities for the company's hardware, including the next versions of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS. The specifics of what will be announced will have to wait until then, but rumors are already swirling about what to expect.

Apple is reportedly “preparing one of the most dramatic software overhauls in the company’s history, aiming to transform the interface of the iPhone, iPad, and Mac for a new generation of users,” according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. This will include updating the style of menus, apps, icons, windows, and system buttons for a more consistent look. It will also mark one year since Apple Intelligence was announced. It's had a rocky launch, and Apple has recently delayed updates to the new Siri experience that would supposedly understand your context. We’ll likely see more news about the voice assistant and future artificial intelligence features to come. —Brenda Stolyar

Rivian Spins Out a New Micromobility Startup

There's a new micromobility startup in town called Also, and it hails from Rivian. It began as a stealth program to explore how Rivian's software and hardware prowess could be applied to smaller electric vehicles, but Rivian decided it “deserved to be its own company.” Rivian maintains a minority ownership stake in Also, with opportunities for collaboration and the ability for the company to leverage Rivian's retail stores. Rivian's founder and CEO, RJ Scaringe, will be chairman of Also's board of directors.

Expect to see the first designs from Also later this year, with a flagship product reportedly arriving in 2026, according to TechCrunch. It's unclear exactly what we'll see first, but the first product has a seat and two wheels, a screen, a few computers, and a battery. That sounds like an awful lot like an electric bike or motorcycle, but we'll have to wait and see.

https://wired.com,Top Trump Officials’ Passwords and Personal Phone Numbers Discovered Online,https://wired.com/story/top-trump-officials-phone-numbers-personal-information-online/,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 10:30:00 GMT","After senior Trump administration members mistakenly included The Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg in a secret group chat about bombing Houthi targets in Yemen, encrypted messaging app Signal found itself at the center of a storm this week. Some commentators criticized the app, going as far to blame it for the scandal.

But the whole affair that’s dubiously been dubbed “SignalGate” isn’t about Signal at all: Experts say officials shouldn’t invite untrusted contacts into sensitive chats and should only use authorized devices, platforms, and procedures when discussing top-secret military operations. In other words, the people who set up the chat made numerous mistakes, and they had nothing to do with how secure Signal is. In fact, Signal has seen its biggest-ever spike in US downloads as a result of the news.

In other news linked to that Houthi group chat, national security adviser Mike Waltz—an account with the name “Michael Waltz” originally invited Goldberg to the group—left his Venmo account open to public view. As WIRED reported, a “Michael Waltz” Venmo account displayed the names of the adviser’s colleagues and friends, revealing people in Waltz’s wider social network. After WIRED reached out to the White House, the Waltz account hid its friends list. There’s more though: WIRED also discovered other Venmo accounts linked to officials in the Signal chat. Information about who officials associate with could be highly lucrative for foreign spies and hackers.

Elsewhere, we reported on all the ways the White House adopting Elon Musk’s Starlink as an alternative Wi-Fi network could be bad news for network security. There are also early signs in Europe that some companies are going cold on cloud services from Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, as they reassess the risks of dealing with the volatile second Trump administration. And, as crossing the United States border becomes more perilous—for both citizens and visa holders—we updated our guide to keeping your digital privacy intact when you are entering the US.

That’s not all. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click on the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.

Top US Security Officials’ Passwords and Personal Phone Numbers Discovered Online

On top of SignalGate and Venmo accounts being left exposed, German news outlet Der Spiegel reported that sensitive personal information linked to several senior Trump administration security officials is easily discoverable online. Reporters from the publication found that mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and “some” passwords for top officials could be found on the internet.

Using people-search engines and information contained in public data breaches, Der Spiegel discovered personal information belonging to Waltz, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense. “Most of these numbers and email addresses are apparently still in use, with some of them linked to profiles on social media platforms like Instagram and LinkedIn,” the news organization reported. The details were also linked to Dropbox, Microsoft Teams, Signal, and WhatsApp accounts used by the officials.",wired

All transactions will be carried out through stock exchanges, with xAI being valued at $80 billion (approximately 12 trillion yen) and X being valued at $33 billion (approximately 4.5 trillion yen).

""The future of xAI and X are closely connected. Today we are taking the first step towards officially integrating data, models, computing, distribution and talent. This combination will combine xAI's advanced AI capabilities and expertise with X's vast reach, unlocking enormous possibilities,"" Musk wrote in the post.

""Since xAI was founded two years ago, it has grown into one of the world's leading AI labs by building models and data centers at unprecedented speeds and scales. X has transformed into one of the world's most efficient companies over the past two years, with an unprecedented speed and scale. It has become a digital 'public square' in which over 600 million active users gather for real-time sources of information, and has become one of the world's most efficient companies over the past two years, and is positioned to achieve scalable growth in the future.""

https://cnet.com,"Disney also joined the battle, and witnessed ""The present of humanoid robots"" at NVIDIA GTC",https://japan.cnet.com/article/35231095/,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 07:30:00 GMT","3月中旬に開催されたNVIDIAのAIカンファレンス「GTC 2025」では、筆者が初めて目にした「NEO Gamma」や、さらなる進化を遂げた「Digit」など、さまざまなロボットが会場を彩った。また、ロボティクス業界のリーダーによる講演も多数行われた。米CNETでは、Boston DynamicsやAgility Robotics、1X、Disneyなど、ロボティクス業界をけん引する企業のリーダーに取材し、各社が現在取り組んでいる課題や未来への夢、そしてその夢を実現するための技術について話を聞いた。

1XのNEO Gamma

1Xが展示していたのは人型ロボット、NEO Gammaだ。家庭を再現した空間で、NEO Gammaはじょうろを手に持ち、来場者に向かってポーズをとり、床に掃除機をかけてみせた。

1Xの共同創業者で最高経営責任者（CEO）のBernt Bornich氏によると、このデモはロボットによる自律動作と人間による制御を組み合わせた「mixed autonomy（混合自律）」を体現しているという。

NEO Gammaはまず人間が遠隔制御することで新しいタスクを覚える。このタスクを十分な確率でこなせるようになったら、その後は自分の失敗から学び、自律的に動きを改善することでタスクの成功率を高めていく。

「私たちが2025年に提供するのは“ロージー”そのものではなく、“ロージー”に至る旅だ」とBornich氏は説明する（ロージーはアニメ「宇宙家族ジェットソン」に登場するお手伝いロボット）。「これ（NEO Gamma）は、この旅に参加したい人のためのロボットだ」

1Xによると、NEO Gammaは自動車より安価で、2025年中に顧客向けに展開を開始する。

Agility RoboticsのDigit

NEO Gammaのすぐ隣では、Agility RoboticsのDigitが棚からランダムに3つのアイテムをつかみ、バスケットに入れ、テーブルの上に置くというタスクをくりかえしていた。

同社の最高技術責任者（CTO）であるPras Velagapudi氏によると、棚に並べられた食料品はGTCに出展するためにAgility Roboticsのチームがサンノゼを訪れた際に買ったもので、どれを手に取るかはDigitが自分で判断しているという。

Digitはビープ音で言葉らしきものも発していた。筆者はスマートフォンに「Waver」アプリを入れ、Digitの言葉を翻訳できるか試してみた。Digitがアイテムをつかみ損ねたときの音は「失敗した :( 」と翻訳された。続くビープ音は次のタスクを知らせているようだ。

GTC 2025の会場ではせっせと食料品をつかんでいたDigitだが、ふだんは倉庫に配備され、終日働くこともあるという。ただし安全上の理由から、Digitが作業する場所は人間の従業員が働いている場所とは区切られた、閉鎖されたエリアとなっている。今後の技術革新により、いずれは人間とDigitが一緒に働けるようにしたいと同社は考えている。

「この目標に向けて、安全な人間検知技術の開発に取り組んでいるところだ。この技術を18カ月以内に次世代ロボットに組み込みたい」とVelagapudi氏は意気込む。

Boston DynamicsのAtlas

Boston Dynamicsの人型ロボット「Atlas」はGTC 2025には出展されていなかったが、CTOのAaron Saunders氏は登壇者として参加していた。パネルディスカッションの後、米CNETはSaunders氏とAtlasの最新の動画について話す機会を得た。この動画にはAtlasが側転し、ブレイクダンスを踊り、走る姿が収められている。

「まずはスタッフがモーションキャプチャー用のスーツを着て一連の動作をする」とSaunders氏は説明する。「1つのモーションキャプチャーをもとに、一晩かけてポリシーをトレーニングし、ロボットに学習させる。現在では、かなり安定した動作が可能だ」

ロボティクスや機械学習における「ポリシー」とは、ロボットやAIエージェントが現在の状態をもとに、次に何をすべきかをどう判断するかを定めたものだ。Saunders氏によると、次は特定のタスクだけでなく、幅広いタスクや行動に対応できる汎用的なポリシーの開発を目指すという。

DisneyのBDX Droidとキャラクターロボットたち

最後に紹介するのは、他社とはまったく異なる「ストーリーテリング」という目的のために長年、ロボットを作ってきたDisneyだ。ストーリーを語るロボットには独自の課題が伴う。

展示会場を歩き回っていた「BDX Droid」たちは、人間のオペレーターによって遠隔制御されていた。オペレーターの巧みな操作がロボットに個性を与え、愛嬌たっぷりの動きで人々を魅了する。

Disney Research のアソシエート・ラボ・ディレクターで、BDX Droidプロジェクトを率いたMoritz Bacher氏は、人間による巧みな制御とロボットの自律的な動きを絶妙なバランスで両立させることが重要だと語る。「通常はオペレーターがクリエイティブディレクターのような役割を果たす。しかし複雑なキャラクターの場合、ジョイスティックやボタンの操作だけでは制御しきれないため、ロボットが自律的に動くことが求められる」とBacher氏は言う。

BDX Droidは自律的にバランスを取りながら移動できるため、オペレーター（つまり、クリエイティブディレクター）はキャラクターを生き生きと動かす作業に集中できる。

この日、Bacher氏は会場で講演し、人型ロボットの開発を含めて、Disneyが現在進めているロボティクス研究を紹介した。詳細は今後、動画で公開される予定だ。

GTC 2025は学びにあふれていた。ロボティクス業界が解決しようとしている課題を知り、ロボットの多彩な用途に目を見張った。ロボットの可能性は広がるばかりだ。

An excerpt from the upcoming book “The Optimist: Sam Altman, OpenAI, and the Race to Invent the Future” offers new details about why OpenAI’s board briefly fired CEO Sam Altman back in 2023.

Written by Wall Street Journal reporter Keach Hagey, the book claims the nonprofit’s board members became increasingly concerned after learning about issues such as an OpenAI Startup Fund that was actually personally owned by Altman.

At the same time, co-founder Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati were reportedly collecting evidence of what they saw as Altman’s toxic and dishonest behavior, complete with screenshots from Murati’s Slack channel. For example, Altman allegedly claimed the company’s legal department said GPT-4 Turbo didn’t need to be reviewed by the joint safety board, but the company’s top lawyer denied saying that.

After Sutskever provided this evidence to board members, they moved to oust Altman and appoint Murati as interim CEO. But this quickly backfired, with OpenAI employees (including Sutskever and Murati) signing a letter demanding Altman’s return — which he soon did, with Sutskever and Murati subsequently leaving to launch startups of their own.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,"‘Tesla Takedown’ protesters are planning a global day of action on March 29, and things might get ugly",https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/29/tesla-takedown-protesters-are-planning-a-global-day-of-action-on-march-29-and-things-might-get-ugly/,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","“Tesla Takedown” organizers have promised their biggest day of global action today, encouraging thousands to protest outside Tesla showrooms, dealerships, and even charging stations to peacefully object to Elon Musk’s role in slashing government spending.

As Tesla protests have spread, so has the backlash. Activists holding up signs are being conflated with masked vandals throwing Molotov cocktails. On social media, and in Washington, the distinction is fading fast.

President Donald Trump has called attacks on Tesla “domestic terrorism” and threatened to send “terrorist thugs” to prisons in El Salvador. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has pledged to prosecute “those operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes,” even though evidence suggests the attacks were carried out by “lone offenders.” And Musk’s decision to accuse at least one peaceful protester of “committing crimes” on X has fueled a public discourse that equates protest with vandalism, and vandalism with terrorism.

If the government or law enforcement starts treating all anti-Tesla actions as criminal, peaceful protesters could find themselves facing consequences meant for extremists.

“Terrorism is a problematic concept in law enforcement because it is by definition differentiated from other violence by its political nature,” Mike German, a former FBI special agent and fellow at the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program, told TechCrunch. “That’s why we’ve seen counterterrorism measures so often result in problematic outcomes targeting the civil rights of people engaged in First Amendment-protected activity, rather than the people who are committing acts of violence.”

The Tesla Takedown protesters have consistently preached nonviolence at rallies and on their website. The movement’s stated goal is not to physically harm Tesla or Musk, but rather to encourage people to sell their Teslas, sell their stock, and stop buying new Teslas.

“The reason that [Musk] is in the position that he is in is because of his wealth, and we feel that if we can continue to drive that Tesla stock price down, we will hit him in the spot that it matters,” Natasha Purdum, a New Jersey-based organizer, told TechCrunch. “Ultimately, we see that as a key to taking down some of the major destruction that is happening in our federal government, courtesy of DOGE and Elon Musk.”

Musk is the world’s richest person in large part due to his Tesla stock. He owns roughly 13% of the company, which today is valued at around $829 billion, making Musk’s share worth around $107.8 billion. That wealth has allowed Musk to spend $44 billion to buy Twitter, the primary platform he uses to communicate to his 219 million followers. Musk has also dipped into his own funds to donate more than $260 million to the America PAC that helped Trump clinch the election.

As someone who spent 16 years as an FBI special agent focused on domestic terrorism, German says he wouldn’t be surprised to see local police working hand in glove with terrorism taskforces — like the one the FBI just formed — to monitor Tesla Takedown protests. Per the Attorney General’s Guidelines, the FBI doesn’t require a factual basis for a suspicion of terrorism to begin conducting physical surveillance, which includes taking photos of people, cars, and license plates, deploying informants to infiltrate a group, accessing private databases, and more.

“It’s also important to understand that law enforcement in the United States is primarily intended to protect the property of the wealthy,” German said. “Corporations in the United States are politically powerful and have access to elected officials and top law enforcement officials. And when their interests are challenged, particularly by protest, they want to present that as a law enforcement issue, rather than as legitimate public concerns about their corporate activities.”

The FBI declined to comment on TechCrunch’s question about whether the agency is taking any special action this weekend. At a protest Saturday in New York City, the NYPD’s counterterrorism unit was in attendance. When TechCrunch asked what their objective was, an officer said their presence was to prevent any violence like arson.

“We’re going to go after them”

Musk and the Trump administration have ramped up their rhetoric in the lead up to March 29, when at least 213 Tesla Takedown protests are scheduled around the world, from Colorado and Kentucky to Germany, Minnesota, France, and Texas.

On Thursday, Musk appeared on Fox News’ “Special Report” to say that he and Trump are going to “go after…the ones providing the money, the ones pushing the lies and propaganda.”

Trump has suggested that the attacks on Tesla property were coordinated to intimidate Musk, despite internal assessments finding otherwise. Musk has also claimed, without showing proof, that certain Tesla Takedown organizers were funded by ActBlue, a nonprofit that funds progressive causes and Democratic candidates.

And Bondi has accused Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) of “calling for further insurrection” after Crockett said that Musk needed to be “taken down” at a virtual Tesla Takedown rally last week. Crockett couched that statement with calls for nonviolence and peaceful demonstrations, but regardless, Bondi said she needs to “tread very carefully.”

German says this rhetoric, too, is an old government trick to try to discredit and suppress protest movements by claiming “a handful of acts of violence are the result of the spread of bad ideas, radical ideas.”

Purdum, one of the Tesla organizers, advised protesters to put their wellbeing first. Leave if you feel unsafe, adhere to your local protest regulations, don’t trespass, follow police orders, and have a lawyer’s number in your back pocket just in case, she said.

“Authoritarian regimes have a long history of equating peaceful protest with violence,” Stephanie Frizzell, a Tesla Takedown organizer from Dallas, said. “The Tesla Takedown movement has always been and will remain nonviolent. Their goal is to intimidate us into silence as we stand against Musk’s destructive actions — but defending free speech is fundamental to democracy. We will not be deterred.”",techcrunch

“XAI has acquired x in an all-Stock transaction,” Musk Said. “The combination values ​​xai at $ 80 Billion and x at $ 33 Billion ($ 45b Less $ 12b debt).”

Musk Went on to Describe the Two Companies ""Futures as"" intertwined. "" He Added, “Today, we official Take the Step to Combine The Data, Models, Compute, Distribution and Talent.”

The Acquisition Places X - The Highly Social Media Platform Musk Purchased in 2022 Under Its Train Name, Twitter - Firmly Under the Umbrella of Musk’s Ai Startup, Which He Founded in 2023 to Compet with Openai. While Xai’s Products, Including its ai chatbot grok, Were Tightly Integrated Into the X Platform before this deal, Friday’s Acquisition Further Combins Two of Musk’s Most Most High-Profile Companies.

According to publications Including the Wall Street Journal, Shares of X and Xai Will Be Exchanged for Shares of A New Holding Company Called Xai Holdings Corp. The WSJ also reports that executives at Both Companies Believed that it would be easier to raise money for a combined entity.

Musk - Whoso Leads Tesla, SpaceX, and Neuralink - Notes in his post that this deal values ​​x at $ 33 Billion (Lowed from an Enterprise Value of $ 45 Billion due to the Company’s $ 12 Billion in Debt). Musk Originally Purchased X for $ 44 Billion in Octuber 2022 and Took It Private. However, the valuation has swung dramatically in recent years. At one point, Fidelity Valued X at Less Than $ 10 Billion.

In the months since the inauguration of President Donald Trump - For Whom Musk Aggressively Campaigned and for Whom Musk Now Serves Under As A Special Advis Leading Dogeing - X’s Valuation has risen, Largely Becaus Investors Believe The Platform More Influenial Now. Musk Said in his post on Friday that x has more than 600 million active users.

Musk Launched xai in 2023 and has sincerefed up the startup with Industry-Leading Ai Researchers from Google Deepmind, Microsoft, and Openai, and Built out the Massive Ai Data Centers Needed to Catch Up with Other Frontier Ai Developers. To fuel these efforts, Musk has gone we have historic fundraising campaign, included a $ 6 Billion Funding Round in December that valued the startup at $ 45 Billion. According to musk, xai’s valuation is now high, at $ 80 Billion.

xai has widely been successful in its mad dash to catch up with openai, google deepmind, and anthropic. In February, The Startup Released Grok 3, A Frontier Ai Model That’s Competitive With the Industry’s Leading Ai Models on Benchmarks Measuring Math, Science, and Coding.

But xai’s successs have not stopped musk from Meddling with Openai, a startup he co-founded with sam altman. Musk is Currently Trying to Thwart Openai’s For-Profit Transition-Which It Needs to Complete To Secure Future Funding-In More Ways Than One. The Billionaire Owner of Xai Has Made Openai’s For-Profit Transition The Centerpiece of His Lawsuit Against Openai. Musk also submitted A $ 97 Billion Takeover Bid for Altman’s Startup in February. OPENAI’s Board promptly rejected the idea, but it already may have driven up the market price for openai’s assets.

One of the Major Advantages That Xai Has Over Openai and Other Startups is its Access to X. The Large Body of Posts That X Has Accumulated Over the Years Gives Xai A Nordicant Advantage in the Race for Ai Training Data. Further, x gives musk’s ai startup a huge consumer app to reach users in.

Musk has a history of blurring the lines between His Many Companies, which has Landed Him in Legal Disorder Before. With xai’s Acquisition of X, the Two are now effectively one - and the move suggests that x’s true value May lie in advancing musk’s Broader ai ambitions.

https://techcrunch.com,Amazon shakes up streaming leadership team,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/29/amazon-shakes-up-streaming-leadership-team/,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Amazon announced this week that Jennifer Salke is stepping down as the head of Amazon MGM Studios — a move that could indicate high-level dissatisfaction with the company’s streaming strategy over the past few years.

To be clear, Salke’s boss Mike Hopkins (the head of Amazon MGM Studios and Prime Video) praised her work in an email to employees and described her departure as one that allows the company to “flatten our leadership structure a bit” — a recurring theme in recent tech company layoffs.

In other words, Amazon does not intend to fill Salke’s role. Instead, the heads of its film and TV studios report directly to Hopkins.

But the reporting around Salke’s departure highlights Amazon’s streaming disappointments and challenges under her leadership. Previously an exec at NBC, Salke joined Amazon Studios in 2018, as the company was looking to expand beyond critically praised movies and shows into more mainstream hits.

The streamer has had its share of successes since then, including “Reacher,” “Jack Ryan,” “Fallout,” and “The Boys.” It also made a big bet on “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power,” a show whose premiere drew a record audience for Amazon, but which has not proven to be the world-conquering phenomenon that you’d hope for with a reported budget of more than $1 billion.

And then there’s “Citadel,” an espionage show designed as the epicenter of a fictional universe of global spinoffs like “Citadel: Diana” and “Citadel: Honey Bunny.” Extensive reshoots reportedly turned “Citadel” into the second most expensive show ever made (behind only “The Rings of Power”), but its reception has been even more underwhelming. The Hollywood Reporter says the second season has been delayed from fall 2025 to spring 2026, with further spinoffs put on hold.

Amazon has also struggled to get another James Bond film into production, following its acquisition of MGM in 2022. Producers Michael Wilson and Barbara Broccoli (longtime Bond producer Albert “Cubby” Broccoli was their father) maintained creative control of the franchise, and a Wall Street Journal report in December suggested that Barbara Broccoli was particularly unhappy with Amazon — she was apparently annoyed in an early meeting when Salke referred to Bond as “content,” and she was even reported to have described the tech giant’s team as “idiots.”

Another source said that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos was, in turn, so angered by the WSJ story about Broccoli that he declared, “I don’t care what it takes, get rid of her,” with the company subsequently paying Wilson and Broccoli to give up control.

Salke’s name was noticeably missing from Amazon’s triumphant announcement of the Bond deal. She will, however, be starting a new film and TV production company with a first-look deal at Amazon.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,CoreWeave co-founder explains how a closet of crypto-mining GPUs led to a $1.5B IPO,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/29/coreweave-co-founder-explains-how-a-closet-of-crypto-mining-gpus-led-to-a-1-5b-ipo/,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","CoreWeave began trading on Friday with more of a shrug than a war cry. The company priced at $40 on Thursday, below the $47- $50 price range announced. It also trimmed the number of shares offered.

All told, CoreWeave raised $1.5 billion and nabbed a $14 billion market cap on Day 1, instead of a hoped-for $3 billion+ raise and a much higher valuation. Shares also opened at $39 (ouch!), and closed at $40. A lukewarm reception.

Still, the company’s IPO lands as the largest AI-related listing to date, and the biggest U.S. tech IPO since the heady days of 2021.

Sitting in an ordinary white hoodie in a bland conference room, and talking with a detectable Jersey accent, Chief Strategy Officer Brian Venturo told TechCrunch that he feels very lucky.

That’s because it all started when he and his hedge fund friends had some extra time on their hands after their last venture together went south.

He had been working as portfolio manager for the energy industry hedge fund, Hudson Ridge, founded by CoreWeave cofounder and CEO Michael Intrator. They had built an ML model to help them pick investments in the data-heavy energy industry. There they met their cofounder, Brannin McBee, who ran the data firm they used.

But after the U.S. veered into its fracking boom era, they closed Hudson Ridge, leaving “a lot of time on our hands,” Venturo says.

Next up: crypto. The wanted to get in, but first “wanted to understand from the commodity side, how is this made,” Venturo said. “So we started doing mining on the pool table in our Manhattan office.”

Thousands of GPUs in a warehouse

Like eating potato chips, one GPU turned into 10. Ten turned into 1,000. The rigs moved from pool table to closet.

“Next thing we knew, we were in the most cliche place possible. We were in my grandfather’s garage in New Jersey,” he joked. Then their friends in finance wanted in so they bought more.

“We were the largest Ethereum miner in the world for like two and a half years,” he says. “At one point, we had 50,000 Nvidia consumer GPUs.”

These were chips meant for playing video games on consumer PCs, not running 24/7 in “a warehouse with no air conditioning or no ventilation,” he said. So the cofounders built “crazy automation and health checking [systems] to run these low grade GPUs in the harshest environments.”

The team knew they wanted to use their GPU empire for other things, like maybe AI training. But they also needed to learn how.

So they connected with EleutherAI, an open source group working on an LLM. CoreWeave offered access to their GPUs in exchange for help learning about AI training and announced a partnership in 2022.

“We thought we were just going to learn how the infrastructure worked,” Venturo says. But EleutherAI was working with hundreds of people building AI startups and “it was this total springboard moment for us.”

The good will from working with EleutherAI led these startups to become paid customers. It was “total luck started the training business,” Venturo said.

Stability AI got wind of CoreWeave through EleutherAI, and became a customer. The founders needed more capital to build better infrastructure.

They went to dinner with Magnetar investors and “I was literally pounding on the dinner table,” convincing them of the future of AI, Venturo said. Magnetar wrote them what he said was a $100 million check.

Open source paves the way

OpenAI learned of CoreWeave through its work with the open source community. And Microsoft learned of the company through OpenAI. Microsoft became its biggest customer because it was OpenAI’s biggest investor and sole cloud provider at the time.

That’s no longer the case. And OpenAI recently signed a $12 billion deal of its own with CoreWeave, bumping Microsoft from being its biggest customer.

Today CoreWeave has 32 data centers and 250,000 GPUs, including Nvidia’s difficult to obtain Blackwell chips, which supports AI reasoning, the company says.

Venturo acknowledges that much has been made about CoreWeave’s jaw-dropping $7.6 billion in debt, much of it due to be repaid in two years, FT reports. Against CoreWeave’s $1.9 billion in revenues (even with, it says, $15 billion under contract), the debt is a big reason why investors have been cautious.

However, Venturo insisted that CoreWeave has structured each customer deal to cover the debt used to buy the GPUs needed. More than that, though, he realizes that three hedge fund guys turned crypto miners who are now running an influential AI training infrastructure have been on a wild ride.

“There’s so many pieces of luck along the way, it’s crazy,” he said.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,Here are Africa’s biggest startups based on valuation,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/29/here-are-africas-biggest-startups-based-on-valuation/,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Last year, funding into African startups edged past $2 billion, returning to pre-pandemic levels and presenting a mixed bag as expected. Signs suggest 2025 will follow the cautious trends of the past two years.

A sharp decline in mega-deals, mirroring global venture capital tightening since the boom of 2020-2021, pushed local and international investors to prioritize sustainable business models and clear paths to profitability.

This shift spelled trouble for well-funded startups that fell short of these criteria, leading to high-profile closures, including mobile commerce platform Copia and agri-focused data analytics firm Gro Intelligence. Notably, both startups had raised over $100 million in venture funding, with Gro Intelligence reaching a valuation of $850 million at its last priced round.

While startup failures in Africa were once largely confined to pre-seed and Series A stages, these closures, including that of Ghanaian fintech Dash and Nigerian biotech 54gene in 2023, signal an ecosystem at a turning point, where even growth-stage and late-stage startups face mounting risks.

Some, instead of succumbing to the pressures of 2024, opted for strategic pivots rather than closures. B2B e-commerce giants Wasoko and MaxAB, for instance, merged operations to conserve cash and streamline resources, leveraging shared industry experience to weather the storm.

Meanwhile, the likes of Moniepoint, Moove, and TymeBank thrived as they drew attention with notable investments from Uber, Google, and Nubank, respectively, buoyed by strong growth metrics and profitability.

These developments show the dual realities of Africa’s post-boom tech landscape: escalating challenges and resilient adaptations.

In this environment, these unicorns and soonicorns remained in the spotlight as they always have. Their successes and struggles not only underscore the continent’s enormous potential, but also shape conversations about the future of its tech ecosystem.

Against this backdrop, it’s an opportune time to spotlight these billion-dollar ventures and the up-and-comers trailing behind.

Unicorns in Africa

Elon Musk says that xAI bought X in an all-stock deal; a16z-backed 11x faked some customers; the Lumon Terminal Pro pops up on Apple’s website; and much more. Let’s dig in!

xAI buys X: X owner Elon Musk announced on X on Friday that xAI acquired X in an all-stock transaction. This combination values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion. “Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent,” Musk said.

Fudging the numbers: More than 20 sources — including investors and current and former employees — told TechCrunch that a16z- and Benchmark-backed 11x has experienced financial struggles, largely of its own making. “They absolutely massaged the numbers internally when it came to growth and churn,” a former employee said.

Block layoffs: A leaked message by Block CEO Jack Dorsey reviewed by TechCrunch revealed that the company — which owns Cash App and Square — was laying off 931 people, or 8% of the company, as part of an “org restructuring.” Dorsey’s email denies that the layoffs are for financial reasons or to replace workers with AI.

“What, me do fraud?” The White House confirmed to TechCrunch on Friday that President Trump pardoned Trevor Milton, the founder of bankrupt hydrogen trucking startup Nikola who was convicted of fraud. The pardon comes just a few weeks after Nikola filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

Speaking of leaks: A leaked database seen by TechCrunch shows that China has developed an AI system that supercharges its already formidable censorship machine, extending far beyond traditional taboos like the Tiananmen Square massacre.

Skunkworks spins out: Rivian’s skunkworks project was spun out of the company with a new name and $105 million in funding from Eclipse Ventures. The startup, called Also, will exist as a stand-alone company from Rivian.

Get your computers ready: Apple announced that Worldwide Developers Conference 2025 will begin June 9. Reports have indicated that Apple has prepared dramatic software overhauls for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. We also expect iOS 19, which, according to Bloomberg, will be “the biggest revamp since iOS 7.”

DNA debacle: DNA testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy this week. The company’s co-founder and CEO, Anne Wojcicki, separately said she is leaving to become an independent bidder for the company. Your data might not be safe, so here are some ways to delete it.

An act of Congress: Kat Abughazaleh, the 26-year-old who was among the people laid off from Media Matters after Elon Musk sued the company, announced this week that she’s running for Congress. “I’m trying to be really transparent about how to run for office, because I feel like it’s kind of this black hole that seems a lot more difficult than it should be,” she told TechCrunch.

A slice of “Severance”: I haven’t watched any seasons of “Severance,” and based on seemingly everyone in the world, I’m absolutely missing out. My colleague Sarah is among those people, and she spotted a Lumon Terminal Pro (the machine they use in the show) on Apple’s website.

Backdoor to China: SpaceX, a defense contractor for the Pentagon, reportedly allowed Chinese investors to buy shares, as long as the funds are routed through the Cayman Islands or other offshore hubs.

The Switch 2 is coming! And at Nintendo Direct, the company announced that it’s working on Virtual Game Cards that allow players to take their downloaded games with them to use on other devices.

ChatGPT’s new image generator launched this week, and with it came a flood of images based on art by Studio Ghibli being posted online. While the debate over whether this is horrifying (Studio Ghibli co-founder Hayao Miyazaki once said that “AI is an insult to life itself”) or cool, it does highlight one thing: Copyrights are still a concern when it comes to AI-generated anything. Although copying the art style isn’t necessarily unlawful, OpenAI training its models on Studio Ghibli’s art operates in a legal “gray area.”

“I think this raises the same question that we’ve been asking ourselves for a couple years now,” Evan Brown, an intellectual property lawyer, told TechCrunch. “What are the copyright infringement implications of going out, crawling the web, and copying into these databases?”",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,A look at Intel Capital before the 34-year-old firm strikes out on its own,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/29/a-look-at-intel-capital-before-the-34-year-old-firm-strikes-out-on-its-own/,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","When Intel Capital announced its plans to spin out from semiconductor giant Intel in January, it came as a bit of a shock considering the firm has been operating as Intel’s venture investment arm since 1991.

In many ways this decision marks the end of an era for what’s considered by some to be the first corporate venture capital firm of all time. The firm was founded nearly 35 years ago and has backed notable enterprise tech companies including: DocuSign, MongoDB and Hugging Face, among nearly 2,000 others.

But for Mark Rostick, vice president and senior managing director at Intel Capital, the transition represents a new opportunity for the VC while allowing the firm to keep many of the benefits it had as a CVC.

Rostick joined the firm back in 1999 after a friend at Intel Capital recommended he should try to get a job there. Rostick, who wasn’t enjoying working as a tech licensing attorney at the time, took her up on it. After he met the team, he said he’d do anything — even mop the floors — to get involved.

“You get to work with the smartest people in the world,” Rostick told TechCrunch. “The hardest thing to do in business is to start something from nothing and get it to literally leave the ground. Those are the coolest people to hang out with because they’re doing something special. The combination of being able to use that training I had [combined] with working with people doing the hardest thing in business, it was irresistible for me.”

Rostick has stuck around for over two decades and seen the firm invest more than $20 billion across more than 1,800 companies while racking up more than 700 startup exits.

The thought of Intel Capital spinning out from its parent company was not a new one, Rostick said, and had been discussed multiple times in the past. The debate always centered on the pros and cons of how the firm would be able move faster, or be more nimble, on its own but also how much the firm would have to give up without a parent company.

But these conversations started to get more serious at the beginning of 2024 and became concrete last fall, Rostick said. He added that him and Anthony Lin, the head of Intel Capital, were able to start getting the team comfortable with the idea of striking out on their own.

“We thought our track record merited attention from outside investors,” Rostick said. “We had done really well, even while, you know, a lot of the venture industry hasn’t been unable to realize exits, we’d had some success doing that, so we felt like we were could position ourselves as a bit of an outlier there.”

He added that Astera Lab’s exit last year helped with their timing. Intel Capital initially backed Astera Labs in 2018. The semiconductor company went public in March 2024 with a $5.5 billion valuation. Astera Labs one year later has an $9.8 billion market cap making it one of the most successful venture-backed exits of 2024.

This success, Rostick said, may have also showed potential LPs that Intel Capital was a firm that was making the right bets and seeing capital returns at a time with very few venture-backed exits. Last year, U.S. venture-backed exits totaled $149.2 billion, according to PitchBook data, which is significantly lower than years like 2019, $312 billion, even when you exclude outlier years like 2021, $841 billion.

It isn’t 100% clear that everyone at Intel Capital was actually on board with the change. At the managing director level alone, there have been multiple departures since these spinoff talks would have started getting serious including: Mark Lydon, Arun Chetty, Sean Doyle and Tammi Smorynski, all of whom had been at the firm for more than 20 years, as originally reported by Axios.

An Intel Capital spokesperson said the recent departures weren’t tied to the news of the firm spinning out.

This move also comes at an interesting time for the firm’s parent company which has had a tumultuous year. Former CEO Pat Gelsinger suddenly retired on December 1 — he had been in discussions with the firm about spinning out, Axios reported. The company has since had to delay the opening of its Ohio chip factory again and decided not to bring its Falcon Shores AI chip to market. It also added Lip-Bu Tan as its new CEO who allegedly has sweeping changes in mind for the company.

Regardless, the spinoff continues.

The firm expects to be fully independent sometime in the third quarter of 2025, Rostick said. The new yet-to-be-named firm will look very similar to Intel Capital now, he added. The firm will keep Intel as an achor investor and will still invest in early-stage startups in the same areas: AI, cloud, devices, and frontier tech, among others. The firm will likely fundraise shortly after the formal spinout.

“We’ve socialized the idea with people, and feel like we’ve gotten a pretty good response,” Rostick said. “We’re not naive. We know it’s going to be a difficult process.”

The success of this new solo firm with be up for the market to decide. But in the meantime, despite everything else, Rostick said the firm largely continues to operate as business as usual.

“We’re investing in new opportunities, actively looking for those,” Rostick said. “We’re maintaining the portfolio by doing follow ons where it’s merited and makes sense for everybody. And, you know, managing portfolio exits as we always would. When we make the switch over, we keep going at the same speed as we have been going today, this has always been the plan.”",techcrunch

https://tomshardware.com,"Chinese PCIe 5.0 SSD boasts 14.9 GB/s speeds, positioning as the fastest mainstream PCIe 5.0 drive on the market",https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/chinese-pcie-5-0-ssd-boasts-14-9-gb-s-speeds-positioning-as-the-fastest-mainstream-pcie-5-0-drive-on-the-market,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 17:40:56 GMT","Chinese manufacturer UNIS (a subsidiary of Tsinghua Unigroup) has unveiled its S5 lineup of PCIe 5.0 SSDs, a strong contender for one of the best SSDs. The company (via ITHome) claims the drive speeds are up to 14.9 GB/s, faster than the Crucial T705 and Samsung 9100 Pro, two of the fastest consumer PCIe 5.0 drives.

The S5 family features the base S5 and the S5 Ultra, both of which conform to the M.2 2280 form factor and use the PCIe 5.0 x4 interface. Soon after their debut in China, some units will reach Western markets for review through online channels such as AliExpress.

The top SSDs in the PCIe 5.0 ecosystem offer sequential reads in the ballpark of 13-14 GB/s, and only marginal gains of a few hundred MB/s differentiate the very fastest. The Crucial T705 held a leading position in the SSD market, only to be dethroned by Samsung's entry into the PCIe 5.0 ecosystem with its 9100 Pro offerings.

The Micron 4600 recently joined the ranks, sporting the Phison E26 and beating the SM2508 controller from Silicon Motion and Micron's 276-layer TLC NAND. The difference in random reads and writes becomes visibly large as Samsung and Micron have broken past the 2,000K IOPS barrier.

UNIS S5 Ultra and S5 PCIe 5.0 SSD Specifications

Swipe to scroll horizontally Name UNIS S5 Ultra Samsung 9100 Pro Crucial T705 UNIS S5 Flash Memory TLC NAND 236-Layer Samsung TLC NAND 232-Layer Micron TLC NAND TLC NAND Form Factor M.2 2280 M.2 2280 M.2 2280 M.2 2280 Controller Unnamed 6nm-based controller Samsung Proprietary (Presto) Phison E26 Unnamed 12nm-based controller DRAM Yes Yes Yes No Sequential Reads 14.2 GB/s 14.8 GB/s 14.5 GB/s 14.9 GB/s Sequential Writes 13.4 GB/s 13.4 GB/s 12.7 GB/s 12.9 GB/s Random Reads 1,700K 2,200K 1,550K 1,800K Random Writes 1,600K 2,600K 1,800K 1,700K

The base UNIS S5 can dish out sequential reads and writes of 14.9 GB/s and 12.9 GB/s, respectively, toppling all other offerings in this territory. The random reads and writes also stand at an impressive 1,800K IOPS and 1,700K IOPS. Despite the apparent oomph, it surprisingly utilizes an older, unnamed 12nm controller and features a DRAM-less design. At launch, the S5 will be available in 1TB and 2TB capacities with no specified pricing.

The S5 Ultra upgrades to a dual-PCB design and includes a DRAM cache. It is said to employ a 6nm controller, which we believe is likely the Silicon Motion SM2508, also found in the Micron 4600. Specifications aside, the sequential reads and writes top out at a relatively slower 14.2 GB/s and 13.4 GB/s, respectively, while random reads and writes drop to 1,700K IOPS and 1,600K IOPS. The S5 Ultra will debut only in 2TB and 4TB variants, which might disappoint budget consumers.

Despite being slower, the S5 Ultra will likely be a better fit for productivity machines due to the inclusion of a DRAM cache. Both SSDs will ship with a 1mm graphene passive heat sink, though active cooling solutions would better handle the heat generated by these SSDs, especially at such high speeds. In any case, these SSDs are said to hit Chinese e-commerce markets shortly. We can only verify these claimed speeds through proper independent testing, as first-party metrics are often biased.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,Microsoft eliminates workaround that circumvents Microsoft account requirement during Windows 11 installation,https://www.tomshardware.com/software/windows/microsoft-eliminates-workaround-that-circumvents-microsoft-account-requirement-during-windows-11-installation,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 16:20:36 GMT","The Windows 11 installer is being tightened to force more users to set up the OS with a Microsoft Account. An official blog post accompanying the latest Insider Preview Build 26200.5516 stated that “we’re removing the bypassnro.cmd script.” The reasoning behind this change, according to Microsoft, is that insisting on a Microsoft Account will enhance Windows 11 security and the user experience. However, all is not lost - offline account devotees - as a rather lengthy regedit command can re-enable bypassnro.cmd.

Last June, we reported that Microsoft had neutered a popular forced online account setup process workaround, which was as simple as inputting an invalid/blocked email account. The change did not phase us; it remained relatively quick and straightforward to sidestep Microsoft’s pushy requirement for signing in or creating an online account. Thus, hitting Shift + F10 and then typing OOBE/BYPASSNRO when facing this install issue became popular among some PC users. This era will end if and when this preview build update reaches mainstream release.

From Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 26200.5516, hitting Shift + F10 and then typing OOBE/BYPASSNRO results in an error message stating the command isn’t recognized. So, this functionality needs to be restored to the Out of Box Experience (OOBE) by adding it to the correct section of the registry.

reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\OOBE /v BypassNRO /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /fshutdown /r /t 0 https://t.co/NuDzQTIFuGMarch 28, 2025

Tech enthusiast Bob Pony replied to PhantomOfEarth’s Tweet, highlighting the change with a command to re-enable bypassnro.cmd on a fresh Windows 11 install. When faced with the Microsoft Account sign-in screen, users need to open a command prompt (Shift + F10) and type:

reg add “HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\OOBE” /v BypassNRO /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f shutdown /r /t 0

On restart, the Shift + F10 and typing OOBE/BYPASSNRO trick will again work its magic. By this, we mean you will restart again and be able to finalize the installation offline and without a Microsoft Account.

If we learn from history, as we should, it is reasonable to expect that Microsoft will make more changes to close down this updated OOBE workaround. Perhaps it will take another six to twelve months, but for those wishing to swerve Microsoft Account requirements with fresh Windows 11 installs, using one of the bootable flash drive utilities like Rufus to make a no-hassle installer from the latest Microsoft Windows ISO file is probably worthwhile.

Installing friction-reducing tools is even more attractive for those who play around with hardware and often re-install Windows. Other users who might wish to install Windows without their personal Microsoft Account include small-time resellers or refurbishers who want to ship a verified working Windows 11 install with all the drivers set up, etc.",tomshardware

Hardware leaker HXL suggests a potential successor is expected for a Q4 launch later this year, with the likely designation of Ryzen 9000G. Other details regarding the core architecture and silicon have not been detailed, so we'll primarily have to rely on guesswork.

Ryzen 8000G APUs were based on AMD's Phoenix silicon and featured Zen 4 cores, while some models down the stack included both Zen 4 and smaller Zen 4c cores. Similar to the Ryzen 7040 APUs for laptops, AMD equipped these processors with up to 12 RDNA 3-based CUs (Compute Units) capable of basic 1080p gaming. This is thanks to the inclusion of DDR5 support on AM5, which is also considered why AMD likely skipped porting Rembrandt to AM4, as it was limited to DDR4.

Zen 5-based mobile APUs are divided into Strix Point for the high-end and Krackan Point for the mid-range. AMD is expected to reuse the same silicon for the Ryzen 9000G family, giving us an inkling about the specs. Strix Point tops 12 hybrid cores (four Zen 5 + eight Zen 5c) in a dual-CCX layout, alongside a beefy 16 Compute Unit iGPU (Radeon 890M) based on RDNA 3.5.

Krackan Point drops this to eight hybrid cores (four Zen 5 + four Zen 5c). While we're still awaiting die shots for confirmation, it's suggested that all eight hybrid cores in Krackan Point share the same 16MB cache pool (single-CCX), similar to AMD's budget Phoenix 2 offerings. We find a Radeon 860M solution on the graphics end, outfitted with eight RDNA 3.5-based Compute Units.

Both families have an XDNA 2 NPU capable of dishing 50 TOPS of AI performance. If our assumptions prove accurate, AMD might be in the running to deliver the first Copilot+ certified desktop offerings with these chips. As AMD reportedly plans a Strix Point refresh with Gorgon Point (Ryzen AI 400?) in 2026, they can leverage surplus Ryzen AI 300 silicon for Ryzen 9000G APUs.

While still no more than a guess, this is a pretty significant uptick in specifications and, thus, performance over existing Phoenix APUs on desktops. It's unlikely, however, that we'll see something like Strix Halo ported to AM5 anytime soon, mainly due to its size, design, and cost. Ryzen 9000G is likely among the last Zen 5 offerings, as AMD is expected to march on to Zen 6 in 2026.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,Russia completes development of 30-year-old outdated lithography tool,https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/russia-completes-development-of-30-year-old-outdated-lithography-tool,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 13:48:23 GMT","Zelenograd Nanotechnology Center (ZNTC) and Planar have concluded developing Russia's first lithography system capable of supporting 350nm-class process technologies (0.35 micron). The development was assisted by Belarus-based Planar company. The machine has cleared official inspections and is undergoing integration trials in Zelenograd. Despite its symbolic significance, the system's design has been outdated by several decades, and whether ZNTC can produce these in volume is unclear.

A new tool

The ZNTC lithography tool — which was officially introduced a year ago — is a 200-mm litho machine based on a solid-state laser with an exposure field size of 22mm × 22mm (484 mm^2). ZNTC and Planar do not disclose critical technical details about the tool, including the wavelength of the laser it uses or the power that the laser can emit. However, it says it uses an energy-efficient 'solid-state' laser with a 'tighter' emission range and longer operational life.

The use of a solid-state light source seems to be an important detail that not only differentiates the tool from those designed by leading fab tool makers but could also give a hint about the company's plans going forward.

Considering that ZNTC makes rather vague announcements (perhaps to keep its progress and the progress of its partners under wraps), it makes sense to examine the so-called best-known production tools from ASML to put ZNTC's achievements into context.

ASML's lithography tools designed for 200-mm wafers used for process technologies ranging from 350nm down to 130nm traditionally utilized one of two main types of ultraviolet (UV) illumination sources, depending on the exact lithography model and process node requirements: mercury arc lamps, KrF (krypton fluoride), or ArF (argon fluoride) laser.

For process technologies of 350nm and less advanced, ASML's i-line steppers used mercury arc lamps with a wavelength of 365nm(405nm and 436nm were less common). For nodes of 250nm and more advanced, ASML used a KrF (krypton fluoride) laser with a 248nm wavelength. Starting from 130nm nodes, ASML's deep ultraviolet lithography systems have used ArF (argon fluoride) lasers with a 193nm wavelength.

A solid-state light source?

An avid reader would ask, ""What is a solid-state laser in semiconductor production?"" Solid-state lasers are widely used in semiconductor manufacturing, yet not for the primary lithographic exposure at advanced nodes. Instead, they are used in supporting roles, such as wafer inspection, defect analysis, marking, and micromachining processes, including wafer dicing or trimming components.

Solid-state lasers operating at around a 365nm wavelength (frequency-tripled Nd:YAG lasers) can also be employed for lithography at mature nodes (e.g., ≥250nm), as they are stable, efficient, and reliable. However, as noted above, ASML has used gas-based excimer lasers (KrF at 248nm, ArF at 193nm) or mercury lamps (365nm i-line) since the late 1990s.

This gets interesting as ZNTC said it is working on a lithography system capable of a 130nm-class process technology, though its development is expected to be finalized sometime in 2026.

Too late?

While a 350nm-class process technology is used for some devices, it is obsolete by today's standards. In the mid-1990s, Intel used this node for its Pentium MMX, Pentium Pro, and early Pentium II CPUs, while AMD produced its K6 processor using the same technology around 1997. Nowadays, advanced chips are made at 5nm-class process technologies or better.

Even Russian chipmakers like Angstrem and Mikron do not manufacture at 350 nm. Both companies operate at resolutions between 250 nm and 90 nm. As such, the new scanner does not match the existing production nodes of major Russian foundries, limiting its immediate commercial relevance to non-critical layers at domestic producers, which will continue to use ASML's PAS 5500-series lithography tools, which are smuggled into Russia.

Still, ZNTC's tool may find limited use in specific sectors. Some automotive and power management ICs are produced using mature processes. Military applications could also benefit from this kind of tool, as cutting-edge performance is not always a requirement for them.

Still, it appears that the new machine's primary aim is to serve as a base for developing more capable versions. ZNTC is currently working on a new model targeting 130nm-class process technologies. Completion is expected in 2026. This version is part of a longer-term roadmap set by the Russian government, which aims for domestic production at 90nm by the end of 2025, 28nm by 2027, and 14nm by 2030. ZNTC and its peers in Russia are well behind the plan.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,Nvidia Breakfast Bytes are now available at Denny's if you want to experience the 'breakfast of geniuses',https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-breakfast-bytes-are-now-available-at-dennys-if-you-want-to-experience-the-breakfast-of-geniuses,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 12:00:00 GMT","If you wish to try out the ""breakfast of geniuses,"" the Nvidia Breakfast Bytes first seen at GTC 2025 are now available at Denny's restaurants. This is the first product of 2025 with the Nvidia name on it that is readily available, is purchasable at the expected price, and is affordable. However, this sub-$5 breakfast of 520 calories made up mostly of flour, processed meat, and sugars, is probably as bad for your health as an RTX 50 graphics card is for your bank balance.

(Image credit: Denny's)

Denny's says the Nvidia Breakfast Bytes are a limited edition menu item, available until May 13. It consists of four pork sausage links, four fluffy buttermilk silver dollar pancakes, and a ladle of maple syrup.

In case you don't know what to do with this plateful of fast foodstuffs, Denny's shares bullet point instructions on ""how to make the perfect byte"" alongside a visual guide to folding the pancake around the sausage like a hot dog. (Wasn't this supposed to be the breakfast of geniuses?)

Actually, those instructions seem to stray a little from Jensen's favorite way to eat, as according to his own lore he would wrap a sausage with a pancake and then dip it into syrup as he chomped from one end to another – which sounds much more finger friendly.

Jensen's full-stack moment

""Denny's will always be a special place for me. It’s where I learned that no task was too small to do well,"" explained Jensen Huang about the special place the special place the restaurant has in his life and career.. ""This dish powered me through my long shifts and eventually inspired the birth of Nvidia at a Denny’s booth right here in San Jose. Seeing it on the Denny’s menu today is a true full-stack moment!""

We don't know why Denny's is removing the Nvidia Breakfast Bytes from the menu in mid-May. But, until that fateful date, Denny's customers will be able to order this menu item online for carry-out or delivery, all day, every day, including late night via Dennys.com and the iOS and Android apps. Denny's customers in San Jose will enjoy a more convenient Nvidia Breakfast Bytes experience, as participating restaurants in this area of California - Nvidia's home turf - will serve the dish for dine-in customers.

After May 13 we guess you'll have to go back to 'menu hacking' to order up Jensen Huang's signature savory and sweet delicacy. Also, by that time, potential Nvidia graphics card customers will hopefully be having better luck securing their hardware at reasonable prices.",tomshardware

Why you can trust Tom's Hardware Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.

It’s been a while since we last reviewed a Dell portable monitor – we looked at the C1422H nearly three years ago. While it offered excellent color performance and build quality, it lacked extended OSD controls, didn’t feature integrated speakers, and was limited to USB-C connectivity alone.

Dell is back with the Pro 14 Plus (P1425), which features a similar design. Unfortunately, our qualms concerning the C1422H haven’t been addressed in this latest model. In addition, its price tag puts it in a precarious position compared to the best portable monitors which offer superior functionality along with larger and higher resolution displays.

Design of the Dell Pro 14 Plus (P1425)

As mentioned, the Pro 14 Plus hones the design of the previously released C1422H. It’s a sleek device with a thin, lightweight aluminum chassis. However, there is plastic framing the matte display, with thick bezels along the top and bottom of the display. The Dell logo is featured prominently in the center of the bottom bezel and again on the back of the display.

The Pro 14 Plus features a weighted base that houses all the controls and ports for the monitor. A hinge at the front of the base allows the display to go from near-vertical to entirely horizontal for storage.

You’ll also notice rubber feet on the corners of the 14-inch display and along the rear corners of the base. This allows the Pro 14 Plus to be used in portrait orientation on either side of your laptop’s internal display without sliding around on your desk. That’s a helpful addition that wasn’t present on the C1422H. The non-stick rubber feet are also on the bottom of the base when using the Pro 14 Plus in the traditional landscape orientation.

Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

There are two USB-C ports supporting DisplayPort Alt-Mode, with one on each side of the base. Raspberry Pi users are out of luck, as there are no HDMI connectivity provisions.

There are also four buttons on the top of the base: power, orientation lock, and brightness control (one to increase brightness, one to lower). Unfortunately, like the C1422H, the Pro 14 Plus still doesn’t include speakers. A lack of speakers isn’t a big deal if we’re talking about a sub-$ $100 budget portable monitor, but it’s harder to ignore for the Pro 14 Plus, which costs $329.

Dell includes a USB-C to USB-C cable in the box, and thankfully, one end features a 90-degree connector. The 90-degree connector allows the USB-C cable to tuck neatly behind the display panel, out of sight from the user. A nice, fabric-covered carrying pouch is also included for transporting the Pro 14 Plus.

Dell Pro 14 Plus (P1425) Specifications

Swipe to scroll horizontally Panel Type / Backlight IPS / WLED Screen Size / Aspect Ratio 14 inches / 16:10 Max Resolution & Refresh Rate 1920 x 1200 @ 60Hz Max Brightness 400 nits Contrast Ratio 1,500:1 Screen Coating Matte Ports 2x USB-C (DisplayPort Alt Mode) Speakers None Weight 1.25 pounds

Dell Pro 14 Plus (P1425) User Controls

The Pro 14 Plus doesn’t include a traditional OSD that you can navigate to adjust picture settings. Instead, you have three buttons on the top of the base, two of which are dedicated to brightness control and orientation lock. As I mentioned, the Pro 14 Plus supports operation in landscape or portrait mode.

The built-in gyro allows the monitor to automatically adjust the picture's orientation when you switch from landscape or portrait mode. The button simply locks the image so that it won’t automatically switch. The Pro 14 Plus doesn’t even include the dedicated ComfortView button from the C1422H, which helped reduce blue light emissions and lessen eyestrain.

Image Quality on the Dell Pro 14 Plus (P1425)

The Pro 14 Plus uses a 14-inch 60Hz IPS panel with a resolution of 1920 x 1200 – a slight step up in vertical resolution from the C1422H, which uses a 1920 x 1080 panel. The panel is covered with a matte finish to lessen reflections.

Display measurements tracked closely with the C1422H, so the similarities are more than skin deep. Our colorimeter showed that the Pro 14 Plus covered 71.3 percent of DCI-P3 and 100.6 percent of sRGB – both were slight gains over the C1422H’s 70.2 percent and 99.1 percent, respectively.

However, the Pro 14 Plus showed remarkable gains in maximum brightness. Where the C1422H could only muster 241 nits at its maximum, the Pro 14 Plus pushed that limit to 409 nits. The next-closest competition was the ViewSonic TD1656-2K, which maxed out at 363 nits.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Dell markets the Pro 14 Plus as a productivity monitor, and I used it as such in my testing. I used my laptop’s internal monitor for my primary work tasks in Microsoft Word. I used the Pro 14 Plus to swap between Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Edge, Slack, and Pixelmator Pro. I found a good compromise using Excel to take up roughly 2/3 of the screen real estate and Slack for the 1/3. I used the entire screen when working in Edge and Pixelmator.

I also used the display to watch a few films in the background as I worked. I watched Disney’s Lightyear, which critics panned, but I found it to be enjoyable when I first saw it with my son when it was initially released in theaters. The colors looked well-saturated with the screen brightness set to maximum.

Then, I placed the Pro 14 Plus side-by-side with the ViewSonic TD1656-2K ; I had to give the edge to the latter with its glossy screen finish. The images looked a tad crisper and more vibrant, even with the brightness disadvantage. I’m a sucker for glossy displays: my laptop’s display and my desktop monitor have a glossy finish, so I naturally gravitate towards them.

Bottom Line

It’s hard to argue with the Dell Pro 14 Plus’s fundamentals. It offers a 14-inch 1200p display that is bright and colorful, the build quality is impeccable, and it has a versatile stand that allows the monitor to be used in landscape or portrait mode. Dell even includes a carrying case in the box.

However, with a sticker price of $329, it would have been nice for Dell to have included some decent speakers on the Pro 14 Plus. A full OSD would also help make better use of this excellent panel for multiple viewing scenarios.",tomshardware

Certaines sont là parce qu'elles sont nécessaires au bon fonctionnement du système d'exploitation. D'autres pour aider Microsoft à gagner plus d'argent. Et peut-être vous aider.

Recevez une sélection de conseils stratégiques et d'astuces concrètes chaque semaine dans votre boîte mail avec notre newsletter Guides pratiques. En savoir plus sur l’utilisation des données personnelles

Vous voulez voir l'ensemble de ses applications et logiciels ?

Sur un PC neuf, allez dans Paramètres > Apps > Apps installées et faites défiler la liste.

Si vous avez déjà installé un grand nombre d'applications tierces, tapez Microsoft dans le champ de recherche en haut de la page pour filtrer la liste.

Lorsque j'ai essayé cela sur une toute nouvelle installation de Windows 11 version 24H2 à l'instant, cette liste comprenait 37 applications. Certaines essentielles. D'autres complètement inutiles.

Grâce à une décision prise en 2023 par les régulateurs européens, vous pouvez désormais désinstaller la plupart de ces applications (merci le DMA). Mais devriez-vous le faire ? Ces applications n'occupent que très peu d'espace disque et n'utilisent ni le processeur ni la puissance graphique, à moins que vous ne décidiez de les faire fonctionner. Le problème est simple : Si vous ne voulez pas d'une application sur votre PC, vous avez le droit de la supprimer.

C'est exactement ce que j'ai fait sur les systèmes que j'utilise quotidiennement. Certaines applications sont mises à l'honneur, épinglées dans Démarrer ou dans la barre des tâches, voire dans les deux. D'autres sont complètement désinstallées parce que je sais qu'elles ne me sont d'aucune utilité. Et puis il y a un troisième groupe, qui représente les applications que je ne veux pas voir encombrer le menu Démarrer. Mais je les garde disponibles dans la liste Toutes les applications, juste au cas où.

Voici comment j'ai décidé des applications à conserver et de celles à jeter. Cette liste est basée sur le contenu actuel de Windows 11 version 24H2.

Les applications que je garde

Une poignée d'applications occupent la première place sur mes PC.

1. Microsoft Store

Vous ne trouverez pas celle-ci dans la liste des applications installées, mais je l'inclus quand même ici.

N'essayez pas de désinstaller cette application, même si vous trouvez les instructions pour le faire.

L'application Store est nécessaire pour mettre à jour de nombreuses applications système intégrées et, grâce aux modifications apportées à la conception du Store, c'est également un excellent moyen de trouver et d'installer des applications de bureau conventionnelles à partir d'une source sécurisée.

2. Microsoft Edge

Le navigateur par défaut de Microsoft pour Windows est pour moi une valeur sûre. Parce qu'il est basé sur le moteur open-source Chromium, il ne souffre pas des graves problèmes de compatibilité qui ont affecté son prédécesseur (qui portait le même nom). Il est même compatible avec les extensions de la boutique Google Chrome. Il dispose en outre de fonctions de protection contre le suivi qui rendent inutile l'installation d'une extension de blocage des publicités.

Edge a aussi son lot de désagréments, notamment son insistance à afficher des notifications pour les sites marchands et sa page d'accueil difficile à personnaliser. Mais je le considère toujours comme un choix judicieux.

Si vous préférez un autre navigateur, n'hésitez pas à supprimer son raccourci dans Démarrer et à le remplacer par celui de votre choix. Mais je vous recommande de le conserver en tant que navigateur de secours parfaitement capable.

3. Outil de capture d'écran

J'adore ce petit utilitaire. Il vous permet de capturer tout ou partie de votre écran en un clic. Vous pouvez enregistrer le résultat sous la forme d'un fichier PNG ou JPEG, ou coller un extrait directement dans un message électronique ou un message sur les réseaux sociaux. Vous pouvez également créer un enregistrement vidéo, ce qui est un excellent moyen de créer des vidéos pédagogiques. Cette application n'a pas remplacé SnagIt, qui reste mon programme de prédilection pour les captures d'écran dans le cadre de mon travail. Mais elle est suffisante pour les tâches quotidiennes.

Étonnamment, les développeurs de Microsoft continuent d'ajouter à ce produit des fonctionnalités qui l'améliorent, comme la possibilité d'extraire du texte d'une capture.

Cette fonction vaut la peine de mémoriser le raccourci clavier : Windows + Shift + S.

4. Terminal

Si vous n'avez jamais appris à utiliser PowerShell, voici votre chance. Terminal combine un shell de commande moderne (désolé, MS-DOS) avec un puissant langage de script, et vous pouvez l'utiliser pour à peu près toutes les tâches imaginables dans Windows. C'est dans Terminal que vous travaillez avec PowerShell de manière interactive. L'environnement Terminal est personnalisable et prend en charge plusieurs onglets, y compris l'ancienne invite de commande MS-DOS, si vous en avez besoin.

L'une des premières choses que je fais lors d'une nouvelle installation de Windows est de remplacer le Windows PowerShell (une application vieille de 10 ans) par le plus récent PowerShell 7. Ouvrez une fenêtre de terminal en tant qu'administrateur, puis utilisez cette commande pour installer la nouvelle version :

winget install --id Microsoft.PowerShell --source winget

Besoin d'aide avec PowerShell ? Vous trouverez une source d'aide inattendue plus loin dans cette liste.

5. Assistance rapide (Quick Assist)

De temps en temps, un ami ou un membre de la famille m'appelle pour se plaindre que son PC Windows fait quelque chose de bizarre. Comme le sait toute personne chargée de l'assistance ad hoc, ces interactions peuvent être extrêmement frustrantes, car la personne à l'autre bout du fil ne sait pas toujours comment décrire ce qu'elle voit. Et il peut être pénible d'essayer de l'amener à lancer des appels de dépannage.

C'est là que l'application Quick Assist s'avère utile. Cet outil vous permet de vous connecter directement à un autre PC, à l'aide d'un logiciel de contrôle à distance qui vous permet de voir l'écran de l'autre personne et même d'effectuer des changements de configuration - avec sa permission, bien sûr.

Comme tout cela est intégré à Windows, vous n'avez pas besoin d'expliquer à votre pauvre âme perdue comment télécharger un utilitaire tiers. Cet outil permet d'éviter les appels d'assistance exaspérants.

6. Les utilitaires classiques : Bloc-notes, Paint, calculatrice et horloge Windows

Ces quatre applications existent depuis les premiers jours de Windows, sont toujours en cours de développement et prennent toutes en charge les normes d'ergonomie modernes.

Le bloc-notes permet désormais de créer plusieurs onglets et d'enregistrer automatiquement votre travail.

Paint peut effectuer des conversions de format avec un minimum d'effort et est utile pour marquer les captures d'écran réalisées à l'aide de l'outil d'écrêtage.

La bonne vieille calculatrice peut faire bien plus que des chiffres, y compris des conversions d'unités et des calculs de dates. Elle peut même produire des graphiques !

Enfin, l'Horloge Windows comprend des fonctions de chronomètre, de minuterie et d'alarme, ainsi qu'un bouton Sessions de concentration que vous pouvez utiliser pour mettre en sourdine les notifications et autres distractions.

7. Microsoft OneDrive

J'ai un abonnement Microsoft 365 Famille et un abonnement Microsoft 365 Entreprise, chacun avec 1 To de stockage en ligne. Et je les utilise régulièrement. Même si vous n'utilisez pas les applications Office incluses dans Microsoft 365, les 5 Go de stockage inclus dans un compte Microsoft gratuit sont utiles pour transférer rapidement des fichiers entre appareils et sont accessibles même si vous vous connectez avec un compte local.

Je ne recommande pas de supprimer cette application, mais de prêter attention à une fonctionnalité déroutante appelée OneDrive Backup.

Si vous n'y prêtez pas attention, vous risquez de découvrir que tous les fichiers de vos dossiers Documents, Images et Bureau sont sauvegardés dans le cloud.

8. Copilot

J'avoue être sceptique quant à l'utilité des outils d'IA générative comme Copilot.

Mais j'avoue aussi que cette application peut être extrêmement amusante à utiliser et qu'elle évolue très rapidement.

Copilot sera beaucoup plus utile lorsque Microsoft réalisera son rêve de le rendre capable de vous aider à interagir avec les applications, à ajuster les paramètres de Windows et à effectuer d'autres tâches fastidieuses sans avoir à fouiller dans les boîtes de dialogue des paramètres.

9. Pense-bêtes (Sticky Notes)

L'application Sticky Notes pour Windows devrait vous sembler familière. Les applications qui vous permettent de coller une note Post-it virtuelle sur l'écran de votre PC existent depuis toujours.

Celle-ci, intégrée à Windows 10 et 11, conserve la simplicité de l'original. Sa principale caractéristique est que vous pouvez également créer des notes autocollantes sur un smartphone et les synchroniser avec votre PC Windows.

J'ai installé les widgets correspondants sur mon téléphone Android et sur mon iPhone (où ils se synchronisent de manière transparente avec l'application Notes d'Apple), ce qui me permet de noter rapidement une note et de la retrouver plus tard.

10. Solitaire & Casual Games

C'est mon plaisir coupable. Je paie même 10 € par an pour supprimer les publicités, qui sont sinon trop ennuyeuses pour que je puisse jouer.

11. Microsoft Teams

Microsoft a finalement réussi à unifier ses clients Teams pour le travail et la maison en une seule application.

Et cela fonctionne plutôt bien.

Je reçois suffisamment de demandes de réunions Teams de la part d'entreprises extérieures pour justifier son maintien, et j'ai même des amis pour qui c'est l'alternative préférée à Zoom.

Les applications que je remplace

Voici une liste d'applications très incohérente. Certaines sont marginalement utiles. Mais, pour la plupart, les applications de ce groupe peuvent être remplacées par bien mieux.

1. Lecteur multimédia (Media Player)

L'application Media Player de Windows 11 n'est pas la même que Windows Media Player, qui fait partie de Windows depuis plus de trois décennies et qui est toujours disponible dans Windows 11 (avec le mot Legacy accolé) sans raison apparente.

La nouvelle application avec l'ancien nom est le successeur de la malheureuse application Groove de Windows 10. Une application qui nous vient de la malheureuse application Zune.

Quoi qu'il en soit, il s'agit d'une très bonne option pour lire des fichiers audio et vidéo aléatoires. Je recommande de ne pas l'installer, mais de la remplacer par votre lecteur multimédia alternatif préféré. (Pour moi, c'est MediaMonkey).

2. Microsoft Photos

Microsoft Photos est plus que compétent pour visualiser votre photothèque et effectuer des modifications mineures.

Vous avez probablement une alternative préférée, alors faites comme moi : Laissez cette application installée, mais supprimez son raccourci du menu Démarrer et remplacez-le par votre application de retouche photo préférée.

3. Microsoft Clipchamp

Cet éditeur vidéo est peut-être utile pour travailler sur des clips vidéo courts.

Mais il existe des dizaines d'outils de ce type sur le marché, et le véritable intérêt de celui-ci semble être d'essayer de vous convaincre de payer 12 € par mois pour un abonnement premium. Merci, mais non.

4. Outlook (nouveau)

Il s'agit du remplacement par Microsoft des applications Mail, Calendar et People qui étaient auparavant incluses dans Windows 10 et les versions ultérieures.

Il s'agit d'un effort à moitié abouti et qu'il vaut la peine de le remplacer par quoi que ce soit d'autre.

Moi, je m'en tiens à Outlook Classic aussi longtemps que possible.

Les applications que je jette

Si vous êtes un fan de l'une de ces applications, n'hésitez pas à continuer à l'utiliser. Les autres peuvent cliquer avec le bouton droit de la souris sur l'option Désinstaller et passer à autre chose.

1. Microsoft To Do

Cet outil rend une simple liste de tâches trop compliquée.

Si vous aimez l'idée de synchroniser ces tâches avec l'application de bureau Outlook classique, il est peut-être fait pour vous.

Sinon, optez plutôt pour Todoist.

2. Microsoft 365 Copilot

Il s'agit peut-être du nom le plus déroutant de la gamme actuelle d'applications Microsoft. Et ce n'est pas peu dire.

Cet outil n'a rien à voir avec l'application Copilot qui fait désormais partie de Windows. Il s'agit plutôt de l'ancienne application Microsoft Office, qui ouvre le site web d'Office ... pardon, de Microsoft 365 dans une fenêtre de navigation dédiée.

Si vous cliquez sur l'un des raccourcis de l'application, il s'ouvre dans votre navigateur par défaut, et si vous utilisez ces applications depuis le web, vous ferez tout aussi bien de mettre en signet un raccourci vers office.com.

3. Films et TV

Cette application est un frontal pour protéger le contenu vidéo que vous achetez ou louez sur le Microsoft Store, où vous pouvez également trouver du contenu d'Amazon Prime Video.

Je la remplace par VLC Media Player.

4. Cartes

À l'époque où Microsoft avait une stratégie mobile, il était logique d'avoir une application qui fonctionnerait avec votre GPS.

Aujourd'hui, si vous voulez trouver un endroit sur votre PC Windows, vous ouvrez votre navigateur et utilisez Google Maps ou Bing Maps

Je pense que cette application disparaîtra lors de la sortie de la prochaine version majeure de Windows.

5. Actualités et météo

La raison pour laquelle ces deux applications sont encore disponibles dans Windows est un mystère.

Elles n'ont pas été mises à jour depuis des années et la stratégie actuelle de Microsoft consiste à intégrer les actualités dans les widgets de Windows 11 et dans la page d'accueil par défaut de Edge.

During these hundreds of flight hours, I have never lost a single device. However, almost daily, I come across social networks on stories of people who have lost their drone. Some crash from their first flight, others after months, or even years of use without problem.

I attribute my success and my chance in part to the experience, but especially to the fact that I regularly check the safety of my equipment. A drone is an aircraft, and just as you would not steal an airplane without having carried out the same security checks, I would not steal a drone without doing the same.

What tests should you do and when?

I perform three series of checks: before the flight, after the flight and every two weeks to a month (depending on the frequency of my flights ... the more I steal, the more I check).

Why checks before and after the flight? The first is used to detect the damage that could have occurred during storage or transport of the drone (and all that I could have missed after the last verification after the flight). The checks after the flight are used to detect everything that could have happened during the flight.

Bimensual/monthly checks allow you to review the drone and examine elements in more detail such as batteries.

And it's not just about examining the drone. Avant flight checks take into account other elements likely to affect your drone.

Check checks before flights

Drone checks

Carefully inspect the drone to detect any visible damage in the chassis, propellers or landing gear. Look for cracks, bursts, deformations and joints that open.

Make sure that the propellers are solidly fixed and free from cracks or bursts. The propellers are cheap, unlike your drone. Replace them if they have signs of damage. I always recommend using original propellers rather than third -party accessories.

Make sure all the propellers are freely running.

Check that the battery is completely loaded and well fixed.

Remote control checks

Check that the remote control is turning properly, that it is completely loaded and that all the joysticks work properly. If you receive error messages (such as the drone requires stagnation of the compass, the IMU or the controller), perform these checks before the flight (the remote control will guide you through the appropriate steps).

Weather report

Consult local weather forecasts to find out the risks of strong winds exceeding your drone wind resistance and precipitation. Most consumer drones have level 5 wind resistance, which means that they can withstand winds up to 38 km/h (consult your user manual or the manufacturer's website to find out your drone wind resistance).

Location

Check that the area in which you want to fly is free from any obstacle and that it is not a regulated area (for example, near an airport or other air exclusion zone).

Check checks after flight

Dry all traces of humidity with a microfiber cloth.

Inspect the drone to detect any damage.

Check if the battery is damaged, inflated or overheated (note that drone batteries heat regularly, but they should not be too hot to the touch).

Clean all dirt from the drone, paying particular attention to the propellers, obstacle avoidance sensors and the camera.

Look for any bursts or cracks on the propellers.

Bimensual/monthly checks

Check the battery load and recharge it to around 50-60 % if necessary, the ideal load for medium or long-term storage.

Carefully inspect all the propellers to detect any damage. Replace those with bursts, scratches or signs of wear, even minors, as this can seriously affect the stability of the flight.

Clean the dirt drone, paying particular attention to the sensors and the camera.

Other advice

Here are some additional tips to fly safely:

I recommend creating and printing a control list before and after specific flights for your drones. Thus, you will avoid missing a step, especially if you are in a hurry to take a photo.

Keep propellers, batteries and a spare tool kit in your drone kit for quick replacement on the ground.

If you manage a commercial drone, make sure you have the necessary certifications and insurance.",zdnet

All transactions will be carried out through stock exchanges, with xAI being valued at $80 billion (approximately 12 trillion yen) and X being valued at $33 billion (approximately 4.5 trillion yen).

""The future of xAI and X are closely connected. Today we are taking the first step towards officially integrating data, models, computing, distribution and talent. This combination will combine xAI's advanced AI capabilities and expertise with X's vast reach, unlocking enormous possibilities,"" Musk wrote in the post.

""Since xAI was founded two years ago, it has grown into one of the world's leading AI labs by building models and data centers at unprecedented speeds and scales. X has transformed into one of the world's most efficient companies over the past two years, with an unprecedented speed and scale. It has become a digital 'public square' in which over 600 million active users gather for real-time sources of information, and has become one of the world's most efficient companies over the past two years, and is positioned to achieve scalable growth in the future.""

SNSs with high real-time capabilities are said to have a high affinity for AI learning data. Elon Musk also once merged Tesla and Solar City, which is similar to the current merger.

https://zdnet.com,Anker's mobile battery on sale on Amazon - one recommended by the editorial department,https://japan.cnet.com/article/35231134/,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 09:31:00 GMT","The ""Smile SALE New Life FINAL"" is currently being held on Amazon until April 1st, and Anker mobile batteries and chargers are on sale.

One of the machines that our editorial department recommends is the Anker Prime Power Bank (9600mAh). The regular price is 14,990 yen, but it is on sale for 27% off at 1990 yen.

At first glance, it may seem expensive. However, what makes this unit great is that it is a large 9600mAh mobile battery, but also has a built-in outlet and can be used as a USB fast charger. In other words, it doubles as a charger and a mobile battery.

It is charged while plugged into an outlet as a charger, so there is a small chance that you will forget to charge it.

The output of the mobile battery is 65W, which not only allows you to quickly charge your smartphone, but also provides sufficient power to laptops such as MacBook Pro.

The body size is smaller in width and width than the iPhone, but weighs quite a bit at 308g.

It is equipped with a color display, allowing you to check the remaining battery level at a glance, and it also displays ""how many W of the battery is currently being charged and discharged."" Therefore, it is convenient to be able to check whether it is really fast charging.
