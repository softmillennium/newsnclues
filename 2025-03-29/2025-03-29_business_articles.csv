Both companies are privately held, which means they are not required to disclose their finances to the public.

Elon Musk has sold social media site X to his own xAI artificial intelligence company in a $33bn (£25.5bn) all-stock deal, the billionaire announced.

Both companies are privately held, which means they are not required to disclose their finances to the public.

Mr Musk said in a post on X that the move will “unlock immense potential by blending xAI’s advanced AI capability and expertise with X’s massive reach”.

He said the deal values xAI at $80bn (£61.8bn) and X at $33bn.

Mr Musk, who serves as chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX as well as an adviser to President Donald Trump, bought the site then called Twitter for $44bn (£34bn) in 2022, gutted its staff and changed its policies on hate speech, misinformation and user verification and renamed it X.

He launched xAI a year later.

“xAI and X’s futures are intertwined. Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent. This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI’s advanced AI capability and expertise with X’s massive reach,” Mr Musk wrote on X.

“The combined company will deliver smarter, more meaningful experiences to billions of people while staying true to our core mission of seeking truth and advancing knowledge.”

It is not clear if the move will change anything for X users – xAI already uses data from X user posts to train its artificial intelligence models and paying X users have access to its AI chatbot Grok.

Manchester City partner Hytro will be used on the Fram2 mission operated by Elon Musk’s SpaceX

What links Elon Musk with Manchester City and one of China’s biggest crypto tycoons? The answer is an English fitness tech company which counts British tennis star Cameron Norrie among its shareholders and, over the next few days, will be boldly going where no man or woman has gone before.

Surrey-based Hytro is the company, and its patented blood flow restriction (BFR) clothing is designed to help athletes train more effectively and recover quicker. It is used by more than 200 professional sports teams across the Premier League, NFL, NBA, NHL and international rugby as well as competitors in Formula 1, boxing, athletics and tennis, like Norrie.

This week Hytro announced a new partnership with Manchester City Women, ahead of the Champions League quarter-final second leg with Chelsea. “The performance partnership will see the team utilise Hytro wearables and technology as part of its world-leading approach to athletic performance and recovery,” Manchester City said.

Hytro, founded by 35-year-old Dr Warren Bradley, cites scientific studies that show blood flow restriction – a compression around the top of the thigh or arm to temporarily reduce circulation – increases muscle stress and makes training more impactful and efficient. The results are stronger muscles, less recovery time and reduced soreness.

It could also have a vital application for astronauts, however. Muscle mass and bone density can be affected by spending time in microgravity because there is no resistance to everyday movement. It is believed that using blood flow restriction may help to counter the harmful effects of spending extended periods in space.

That theory will be tested over the coming week on the Fram2 mission, which is aiming to be the first human spaceflight over the Earth’s polar regions. It is being operated by Musk-founded SpaceX on behalf of Chun Wang, a Chinese-born crypto investor who is also commanding the mission as one of four people on a Crew Dragon spacecraft.

During the mission, which is set to blast off on Tuesday and last three to five days, the crew will wear blood flow restriction products made by Hytro and Canadian company Delfi Medical Innovations during exercise. It will build on research from last year’s Polaris Dawn mission, which was also operated by SpaceX, in which Musk owns a 42 per cent stake.

Hytro test could speed up Musk Mars mission

The tests, which will be carried out at 450km above Earth, are part of a project in collaboration with the Advanced Wellbeing Research Centre at Sheffield Hallam University, Northumbria University’s Aerospace Medicine and Rehabilitation Laboratory and space technology leaders Vast and Labfront.

“This study is a massive step not just for Hytro but also the wider BFR community,” said Dr Joe Handsaker, the company’s chief innovation officer.

“By proving that BFR is safe to perform not only passively, as we saw on Polaris Dawn, but also whilst performing exercise, this will unlock the next stage of space research where we will be able to look at whether BFR improves exercise efficiency as much in micro-gravity as it has been shown to do here on earth.”

If successful, it could even accelerate Musk’s quest to populate other planets. “Our ability to maintain our muscle mass and function is crucial not only for spaceflight but for our everyday lives,” said co-study lead Dr Tom Maden-Wilkinson, of Sheffield Hallam University and Emles Bioventures.

“In bringing together experts from different fields of industry and academia, we hope that this work helps bring us ever closer to some of the solutions that will enable the aim of humans going to Mars.”",cityam
https://cityam.com,Adolescence star Erin Doherty on being 'consumed' by the role,https://www.cityam.com/erin-doherty-on-surviving-adolescence-queer-storytelling-and-why-she-hates-her-phone/,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 10:02:00 GMT","Adolescence star Erin Doherty on being ‘consumed’ by the role, her LGBT identity and hating her phone

Erin Doherty talks to City AM The Magazine about surviving Adolescence, shrinking away from fame and why she hates her phone

Erin Doherty on the impact of her big hit on Netflix: Adolescence ‘consumed’ her, she tells Adam Bloodworth

Erin Doherty had already captured the zeitgeist. Her performance as Princess Anne in The Crown had such subtle power that it made casting director Nina Gold realise working class people could play aristocrats. Then as crime lord Mary Carr in A Thousand Blows, she was lauded as one of the most versatile actors of her generation. Next came Adolescence, in which Doherty plays a child psychologist interviewing a teenager accused of murder, which blew everything else out of the water.

Doherty leads some of the most harrowing scenes in the mini series, which has garnered the biggest audience for any streaming TV show in the UK in a single week. It’s become hard to pop to the shops without people asking “have you seen Adolescence?” – and everyone sounds genuinely unnerved. Asking questions about masculinity and online culture, it follows a 13-year-old boy, Jamie, who’s been accused of murder. Shot as live, each episode is filmed in a single take, with actors allowed to improvise, making its form almost as interesting as its content. Owen Cooper, who plays Jamie, has already landed the role of young Heathcliff in a forthcoming film adaptation of Wuthering Heights.

Doherty says she was genuinely scared during filming. You can’t turn away from her interrogation, which controversially humanises a murder suspect, but also shows the mental health repercussions on the psychologist.

Erin Doherty: filming Adolescence exhausted me, but it was worth it

We start by acknowledging that, by anyone’s standards, it’s been quite the year. “It took a good month to get it out of my system,” says Doherty of Adolescence. “You can’t escape what it’s doing to you, it kind of gets in your bones. There’s no copy and paste formula like, ‘Okay, I’ll do this, and then I’ll be Erin again.’ I was just so consumed and exhausted, just at the level of emotional intensity of this thing.’” Doherty is propelled by the show’s themes about online radicalisation of young men. “I think we all have to hold ourselves accountable for trying to break the cycle in some way.”

Talking over Zoom, Doherty wears a luminescent blue jumper and an even brighter smile. Unlike her most famous roles which veer towards austere, she is cheery and incredibly gracious. The first thing she offers is motherly reassurance about the tech issues I’ve had logging onto our call. “It’s so stressful, but you don’t need that anymore – it’s all gone!” She chats effusively about everything from how she hated school to bingeing The Crown and obsessing over her characters. If a PE teacher were to mark her interview style, they’d commend her for “giving 110 per cent.”

Had it not been for Adolescence, her boxing drama A Thousand Blows, released this February on Disney Plus, would still be brewing in the public consciousness. Doherty’s female crime lord was gently terrifying, with some hilarious lines, and that’s without mentioning the game-changing representation: bad-ass Victorian female crime lords, based on women who actually existed, aren’t your classic prime-time fodder. She spent a year filming that, then went straight into Adolescence, both with Stephen Graham, who invited her into the latter after being impressed by her work on the former: “I didn’t even read the script,” she says. “Whatever he does is just full of pure heart and love and care. I just knew that it was gonna be so vital; he doesn’t take on projects lightly.”

Netflix: Adolescence breaks the record to get the biggest viewership of any mini-series on the platform

The show has become the first streaming show ever to top the UK’s weekly TV ratings. “With something that is so frightening, it’s so easy to avoid it and to just go, ‘What a horrible thing that some people can do, I can’t get my head around it.’ Whereas this show is going, I understand how frightening a prospect that is, but we have to hold ourselves accountable for shining a light and going, ‘How are these events happening?’” says Doherty.

“Especially with our younger generation, we deserve to humanise how they get there, because otherwise, again, they just become this kind of two dimensional evil ‘other’. And actually, I do believe that everyone is born a good person. I don’t think that people are inherently evil. So it’s always necessary, it’s always worthy of our time to pick at that and go, ‘Oh my God, how did you get there?’”

Chuck in eight West End eight shows a week on top of her promotional schedule for Adolescence (she’s currently starring in the play Unicorn) and despite how she clearly loves talking about the show, she admits she’s “sooooo readyyyyyy” for a holiday. I suspect her ability to appear affable even when she’s exhausted has helped her schmooze numerous big-wigs on her way up.

You wonder how our brightest Hollywood hope would fare on a sun lounger. Doherty admits she obsesses over people to a degree that isn’t healthy. “It’s my biggest thing that I battle with,” she says. “I think we’ve all got demons. For me, it manifests as overthinking. I’ll get to the end of the day and I’ll lie in bed and be like, ‘Oh God, I hope that person didn’t take that the wrong way.’” She has to be careful that this approach doesn’t wear her down, because she “grew up a people pleaser.” But her ability to over-analyse can yield positive results, working in favour of forthcoming projects. When she researches roles, “I’ll dig and dig and dig and really try to understand and pick up why people behave the way they behave. I could linger on a specific interaction for a week.”

I don’t need to know what you think about my work. If you want to come up to me and talk about it, great, but I don’t need to be a part of that conversation online

Growing up in Crawley, West Sussex, as a young girl Doherty and her older sister would take acting classes at the weekends. She was the shy one, but nevertheless remembers the experience changing her. “Something flipped through art,” she says. “I was like, ‘Oh, I don’t have to be Erin anymore.’ That was my first lasting impression of what acting and being someone else could do, mentally. I can put that anxiety down for a couple of hours and just let go. There’s not been anything else that I’ve found so freeing. It’s just in me. I don’t know how I would function without this ability to just let go.”

She took a one-year course at the Guildford School of Acting in 2011, not long after leaving high school. Studying acting at the Bristol Old Vic, she graduated in 2015 and was first inspired to tread the boards after watching Mike Bartlett’s Earthquakes in London at the National Theatre, a vivid, chaotic interpretative dance number about, amongst other things, climate change.

Call The Midwife and the BBC miniseries of Les Misérables were early roles, but the part that properly propelled her came in 2019 when she was cast as a young Princess Anne in The Crown. Casting director Nina Gold had thought “playing a whole different social class is one of the most difficult things to do convincingly”, but has admitted, “Erin really blew that theory.” She was captivating as the poised young princess, revealing a vividness to the most reluctantly camera-ready of the late Queen’s children. She still binges The Crown, and is obsessed with Imelda Staunton. “I got to meet her the other day. We were working on an audio book, and she is everything you want her to be. I absolutely binged the last series and thought it was phenomenal.”

Looking back to where it all began, Doherty reminisces about studying musical theatre at her comprehensive school in Crawley. She still has family there, and pops back regularly, but as a whole she cannot wax lyrical about the institution. “I hated school with a passion,” she says. “But the drama department was so pivotal to me.” She’d love to go back and jump in on some lessons. “I have such admiration for teachers but I could never see myself having the skill and ability.”

Erin Doherty on working with Stephen Graham

If not through teaching, she has always been keen to promote the idea of levelling up. Doherty seems genuinely overwhelmed when I read the Nina Gold quote to her. “For her to say something like that, I don’t really know how to deal with that. I’m just grateful she took a chance, and I hope that it encourages other casting directors to keep doing that, because I think without them taking that leap of faith, so many actors wouldn’t get their foot in the door. I think that an actor’s job is to transform.” She’s passionate about “bringing working class actors into the world of screen acting,” and has been inspired by Stephen Graham. “He’s so brilliant at climbing the ladder, looking down and helping people up. That’s so inspiring to me. If I could do what he did for me and is continuing to do for others, I’d be so overjoyed.”

Away from work, Doherty is private, but decompresses by enjoying the small things. “Walks, family, engaging in normal conversation.” You sense she finds the concept of celebrity so bizarre that describing her downtime is a weird notion in itself. Despite whatever’s been written about her (none of which she reads), success has forced her “to really, really lean into my people. I have a very small circle.” She is happily in a relationship, but contrary to newspaper headlines, her girlfriend “isn’t in the industry”.

You can see why Adolescence appealed. She admits she is “awful” at her phone, always leaving her family on read, and says too many of us are addicted to technology. “I don’t think I’m doing it right either,” she says of her scarce digital approach. “I feel like there’s got to be a better balance. I’ve just kind of gone the opposite end of the scale.” Of Gen Z, who are growing up internet natives, she has “such empathy.” “It just completely freaks me out. I don’t know how I’d manage.”

She shies away from public perceptions about her, and is firm about why: “I just want people to watch the show. I don’t necessarily need to know what you think about it. If you want to come up to me and we’ll talk about it, great, but I don’t need to be a part of that conversation online. That’s not for me.” Instead, her family and set of lifelong friends are her barometer. “They’ll be like, ‘Things are really positive for you. Just know that you’re doing alright.’ I don’t need to look any further. If my people are telling me that it’s all good, then that’s enough.”

Queer representation

As for what’s next, she’s vague, but implies nothing’s firmly on the table yet. She will reveal, though, that more queer storytelling is a priority. “I feel like that’s going to be the route that I go down. Because, as I say, I’m so deeply passionate about telling queer stories and providing that representation. I hope that’s something I’ll get to pursue down the line. Breaking the kind of mould of it being a trope or like a cliche, being the queer friend, or the exploration of the relationships. They do exist, but it’s really rare to find the nuance and the levels of detail of what it means to be queer.” She’s inspired by “the way Steven collaborated with Jack Thorne on Adolescence. I’d love to maybe collaborate with a writer because I don’t know if I’ve got the bravery to be like, ‘And now I’m going to write this thing.’ I hold my hand up, I am definitely an actor.”

She circles back to that much needed holiday, then, on the topic of future roles, offers me a final one of her beautiful thought spirals. “I just like people,” she says. “Trying to figure out why we behave the way we behave, whether that means putting on a corset and walking down the cobbles of East End London or putting on an Adidas tracksuit and exploring what that means in 2025.”

Dr Welby resigned in November after a report revealed he did not adequately follow up on reports about serial abuser John Smyth.

Former archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said he was “overwhelmed” by the number of child sex abuse allegations he was informed of.

Dr Welby resigned in November after a report revealed he did not adequately follow up on reports about serial abuser John Smyth, who was heavily involved with the Church of England.

The report concluded that Smyth, thought to be the most prolific abuser associated with the Church, might have been brought to justice had Dr Welby formally reported allegations to police in 2013.

In his first interview since his resignation, the former archbishop told the BBC he failed to follow proper procedure because of the sheer scale and size of the problem.

“Every day more cases were coming across the desk that had been in the past, hadn’t been dealt with adequately, and this was just, it was another case – and yes I knew Smyth but it was an absolutely overwhelming few weeks,” he said in an interview for this week’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg show.

He added: “It was overwhelming, one was trying to prioritise – but I think it’s easy to sound defensive over this.

“The reality is I got it wrong. As archbishop, there are no excuses, being overwhelmed is a reason, it isn’t an excuse.”

The Makin Review, published on November 7 last year, found Smyth had subjected as many as 130 boys and young men to traumatic attacks across five decades in three different countries in the UK and Africa.

The then-archbishop resisted calls to resign for several days after its publication before announcing he was stepping down on November 12, saying he has decided to go “in the best interests of the Church of England, which I dearly love and which I have been honoured to serve”.

On December 5, Dr Welby gave his final speech in the House of Lords saying that while safeguarding in the Church of England is “a completely different picture to the past”, it is “clear” he had to quit.

Critics accused him of making light of serious safeguarding failures in the address after his references to a 14th century beheading draw laughter from the Lords benches and adding “if you pity anyone, pity my poor diary secretary” who had seen weeks and months of work “disappear in a puff of a resignation announcement”.

A victim of Smyth says he is “appalled” by the “tone deaf” speech.

Dr Welby apologised the next day, adding: “It did not intend to overlook the experience of survivors, or to make light of the situation – and I am very sorry for having done so.”

Smyth died in 2018 in Cape Town aged 75 while under investigation by Hampshire Police, and so was “never bought to justice for the abuse”, the Makin review said.

Consumer confidence has become a casual predictor of GDP. Labour can use this to their advantage, writes JL Partners senior data scientist Callum Hunter

Recent JL Partners polling reveals a troubling economic outlook: 43 per cent of voters expect sharp cost of living increases this year, with more than a quarter believing the economy will significantly worsen. On average, voters expect inflation to exceed seven per cent for 2025, despite official forecasts being lower.

But the government is unlikely to benefit from actual inflation rates being lower than public expectations. These public perceptions are shaped by everyday shopping experiences, where prices have been steadily increasing over the past two years. The disconnect between official statistics and lived experience creates a significant communication challenge for the government.

The bad news keeps coming: consumer confidence is rapidly declining. After standing at -13 post-election, GfK’s consumer confidence index fell to -20 by February 2025 and is projected to reach -27 by September – the lowest since October 2023. This decline threatens both economic growth and political stability, as Labour’s electoral coalition fragments under economic pressure.

This isn’t just bad news for households; it is a serious economic risk. A lack of consumer confidence means weaker growth and less fiscal headroom for the government, as the Spring Statement revealed.

Raise consumer confidence and GDP will follow

However, this challenge presents an opportunity. Our economic analysis suggests consumer confidence has become a causal predictor of UK GDP, typically seen in post-crisis recoveries. After the 2008 crash, confidence predicted GDP growth for five years, and a similar pattern has emerged post-pandemic.

Based on current confidence levels, JL Partners forecasts 1.2 per cent GDP growth for 2025, matching Goldman Sachs’ November 2024 prediction and slightly exceeding the OBR’s latest forecast. If the government can boost consumer confidence, GDP could increase by an additional 0.4 percentage points, adding £10.2bn to the economy annually. In an optimistic scenario, growth could reach 2.2 per cent, delivering an extra £26bn.

This isn’t merely economic but crucial for Labour’s political survival. Post-October Budget polling showed two-thirds of voters would approve of Labour’s record if average wages increased. However, improving consumer confidence presents significant challenges.

February research identifies the weekly food shop and energy bills – not housing or wages – as the primary drivers of cost-of-living concerns. Changing public perception on these issues could boost confidence, but messaging alone is insufficient, as demonstrated by the US election. The government must take visible action by investing in infrastructure, removing growth barriers and delivering tangible results.

The public needs to feel real benefits

This reality creates a complex political-economic feedback loop: economic perceptions drive voting behavior, which influences government policy, which in turn affects economic outcomes. Breaking into this cycle with effective interventions is essential for both economic recovery and political stability. The challenge is magnified by the fragmented media landscape, where government messaging competes with numerous other narratives about economic conditions.

Labour should explicitly connect every clean energy investment to reduced consumer bills and emphasize how breakfast clubs lower food costs for struggling families. Research shows that over half of business leaders believe Heathrow’s third runway will increase business investment, while 48 per cent feel Reeves’s “growth budget” will boost business confidence. These announcements influence both businesses and the public.

For Labour, stronger economic growth depends not just on interest rates or fiscal policy, but on convincing people the worst is over and that reforms will help them. Failure to win this argument will hamper political stability and economic recovery.

Labour’s strategy must operate on multiple levels simultaneously. Short-term interventions that provide immediate relief can build credibility for longer-term reforms. Successful communication requires translating complex policies into tangible benefits. Additionally, the government should leverage local success stories and community-level improvements to reinforce national messaging.

The coming months represent a critical window for establishing economic credibility. If consumer confidence continues to decline throughout 2025, reversing the trend will become increasingly difficult. The government must prioritise policies that deliver benefits before the next budget.

It can take as long as four months to sail from the shores of the British Isles to the port of Brisbane, where the first Test of the British and Irish Lions tour will take place.

It can take as long as four months to sail from the shores of the British Isles to the port of Brisbane, where the first Test of the British and Irish Lions tour will take place.

Given there’s only 114 days until that first Test, it would be one hell of a shift for Shaun Edwards – the Wigan-born defence coach currently worth his weight in gold as France assistant coach – to get to Queensland in time for kick-off.

But that’s what he said he’d do if he was called upon by Lions head coach Andy Farrell to serve under the crusade of a tour to Australia.

Clearly, then, he either had a change of heart or he was never called upon. That or the French national team blocked any move to send the former rugby league guru Down Under to help the Brits (and Irish).

Pick of the bunch

Instead interim Ireland head coach Simon Easterby will take the reins, it was announced on Wednesday. An odd decision given the quality of Edwards within the France regime and Easterby’s performance with Ireland during the Six Nations – where they finished below France and England having won the last two tournaments.

But generally speaking the announcement was to be expected. Scotland forwards coach John Dalziel will take up the same role with the Lions while John Fogarty goes to Australia as scrum coach. Andrew Goodman is set to be attack coach, with Richard Wigglesworth likely to oversee skills and backs as England’s sole representative.

It is the first time since 2001 that no Welsh coach will be involved with the iconic Lions touring party, but can anybody blame Farrell? I’m not sure anyone can name a Welsh coach from any part of the post-Gatland era, let alone one worthy of going to Australia.

Read more Farrell draws heavily on Ireland staff for British and Irish Lions coaches

It was expected for Farrell to go with what he knows, albeit the inclusion of Dalziel is a bit of an anomaly. However, you need some sort of representation for the Scots.

Whether Wigglesworth goes as a backs coach or as an attack coach, he has helped England turn a boring approach to Test rugby into one that really stuck it to the likes of Wales and Italy during the Six Nations.

Lions decisions

It is going to be a cracking tour and the selection of coaches really does bring it all closer to reality. But I do wonder whether the selection of this coaching set-up means we are going to see a player curveball.

Something that could be missing from the entirety of the touring party – coaches and players – are current or former players who have won on the British and Irish Lions tour.

Sometimes there’s no amount of information a coach can tell you that’ll be worth the same as a real playing experience, and that’s where this young Lions side could come unstuck.

If I were Farrell and co, I’d seriously be considering selecting one of the likes of Owen Farrell, Dan Cole, Courtney Lawes or Taulupe Faletau to remind the lads exactly what it means to win Down Under. The touring group last did it in 2013.

Nevertheless, the “Investmentweek” has noticed strikingly over the 30-year-old in the past. Hardly a day passed on which Michael C. Jakob or his companies could not be found on the homepage of the portal. After the Business Insider request, many articles about Jakob were suddenly deleted.

Business Insider has therefore taken a closer look at the “Investmentweek”. Instead of an ""excellent financial journalism"", articles stuck on the website can be found - and always serious accusations. For example, the portal of renowned financial experts accuses return fraud and horror fees.

Above all, there are a number of clues for a suspicion that has been circulating behind the scenes in the financial world for a long time: Is Michael C. Jakob behind the ""Investment Week""?

Seven electric cars burn in a Tesla car dealership in Lower Saxony and are completely destroyed.

The police investigate the cause of the fire, while the ""Tesla Takedown"" campaign day is organizing protests worldwide.

Activists criticize Elon Musk and Tesla for work exploitation and environmental destruction, while protests are planned in over 500 cities.

In a Tesla car dealership in the Lower Saxony district of Verden, a total of seven electric cars were caught fire and completely destroyed on Saturday night. To what extent the fire with the ""Tesla Takedown"" campaign day, which takes place this Saturday, is unclear.

The day of action is said to be a global resistance to Elon Musk and his car company Tesla.

The cause of the fire in Lower Saxony is still unclear. The vehicles went up in flames in the early morning, around 3:30 a.m. They burned out completely. This emerges from the report by the local police. According to the officials, the damage amounts to hundreds of thousands of euros.

Attacks on Tesla vehicles are increasing, according to the report

Due to the strong smoke development, the emergency services have asked the population to keep doors and windows closed. The burned -out cars are to be recovered by a special company, the extinguishing measures have ended.

Burning cars from Tesla have not been uncommon in the United States in recent months. According to the Washington Post, violent attacks on the group's vehicles are piling up. The attacks are directed against dealers, superchargers and vehicles, whereby the damage is high.

Alliance ""Tesla Takedown"" invites you to a global protest

However, the alliance ""Tesla Takedown"" called for a peaceful protest for this Saturday. It should be a global day of action. A total of around 500 protests are to take place on all continents - including metropolises such as New York, London and Paris.

In the United States alone, demonstrations have been announced before all 277 Tesla showrooms. The activists even want to block charging stations - so -called superchargers. In Germany, campaigns are planned in Berlin and Hamburg.

Activists want to set signs against Elon Musk

The activists want to set a clear signal - against the group's business practices and personally against Elon Musk. The accusation: work exploitation, environmental degradation and attacks on democratic values.

There is also criticism of the role of Elon Musk as a political consultant by Donald Trump and his support for controversial austerity measures in US authorities.",businessinsider

The Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen criticizes the rhetoric of the US Vice President J.D. Vance.

Rasmussen offers discussions about a stronger US military presence in Greenland and emphasizes the importance of diplomacy.

Hundreds demonstrate in front of the US message in Copenhagen against US interests in Greenland with clear slogans.

""So you don't talk to tight allies."" With these words, the Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen has the US Vice President J.D. Vance. In a video on X, which was only uploaded to Greenland hours after Vance's visit, Rasmussen gave the Republican a lesson in diplomacy.

The US Vice President had previously expressed sharp criticism of Denmark in a speech in front of US soldiers at the US base Pituffik. In view of the threats of Russia and China, Copenhagen do not do enough for Greenland's security, according to US President Donald Trump.

We do not appreciate the tone in which this is performed at all.

Of course, Denmark is open to criticism, emphasized Rasmussen. However, he added: ""But to be honest: We do not appreciate the tone in which this is performed."" So you don't talk to tight allies, for whom he continues to keep the USA and Denmark.

Although he addressed his words to ""our American friends and everyone else who listens"", he clearly referred to Vances.

Danish Foreign Minister makes the point of view clear

Rasmussen offered talks about a stronger US military presence in Greenland. The joint defense agreement of 1951 offers extensive options for this. ""If it is what you want, let's talk about it,"" said the Liberal Danish politician. It stated how the United States has drastically reduced its military presence on the island belonging to Denmark since 1945. ""We can do a lot more within the agreement we have,"" said Rasmussen.

Specifically, he replied to Vance's criticism of Copenhagen: ""(...) fact is that we all benefited from peace. We all acted in the assumption that the Arctic was a region of low tensions. But these times are over. The status quo is not an option."" Denmark has therefore already decided one billion US dollars (around 920 million euros) in investments in the security of the Arctic. It should also not be forgotten that Greenland is part of NATO, added Rasmussen.

Meanwhile, hundreds gathered in front of the US embassy in Denmark's capital Copenhagen to demonstrate against the US fantasies of a takeover of Greenland. With slogans like ""Greenland is not for sale"" and ""Back, USA!"" they expressed their displeasure.

Picture Alliance / Sipa USA | Sipa USA

According to the “Financial Times”, the Trump government calls on a number of EU companies to hire programs for diversity, justice and inclusion.

The letter also affects companies that work as a service provider for the US government outside the United States.

Experts doubt the legal enforceability of this measure, while Europe reacts alarmed.

Donald Trump's government has asked several large companies in the EU to adhere to a US decree that prohibits programs for diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI). The ""Financial Times"" reports.

The letter was sent, among other things, by the US embassy in Paris and several other diplomatic representations in the EU and affects companies that work as a service provider or supplier for the US government-even if they are outside the USA.

Donald Trump wants to prevent the programs

According to the report, a questionnaire entitled ""Certification on compliance with the applicable federal antidis crimination law"" was attached to the letter. It states: ""Commitment to the US State Department must certify that they do not operate programs, promote the DEI and violate applicable anti-discrimination laws.""

It also says: ""You recognize that this certificate is essential for the government's payment decision and is therefore subject to the False Claims Act."" The US government thus declares compliance with this rule as a prerequisite for public orders.

Europe reacts shocked to the demand

With the advance, Donald Trump's government is expanding its anti-DEI policy for the first time to foreign companies-previously it had already acted against US companies such as Disney. US diplomats in Eastern Europe and Belgium also sent writing. The reactions in Europe were alarmed.

The French Ministry of Finance was also informed by affected companies and reacted critically. A confidante of Economics Minister Eric Lombard said: ""This practice reflects the values ​​of the new US government. They are not the same as ours."" France will also make it clear to the US authorities. The letter became publicly known by a report by the French Wirtschaftszeitung Les Échos.

Are now threatening consequences for European companies?

Legal experts doubt the enforceability of this extraterritorial measure. The first assessments assume that it is not legally binding. Some companies have therefore decided not to react for the time being. The advance takes place in the middle of growing tensions between the USA and Europe-including new US tariffs on European car, steel and aluminum imports.

In France, the procedure is also rejected because the programs are hardly widespread there anyway. Legally, companies are prohibited from collecting racial or ethnic data or taking into account in personnel decisions.

According to “Financial Times”, companies from the aviation, defense, consulting and infrastructure industry could be affected. The letter ends with the note: ""If you do not want to sign this document, we would be grateful if you could give us detailed reasons that we will forward to our legal department.""

Robert Geiss is known as an entrepreneur, reality TV star and self-proclaimed Lebemann. Together with his wife Carmen, he built up a public image as a jet set millionaire-with yachts, villas and striking fashion.

At the moment, however, the facade seems to crumble a bit.

Five models stand out - each tells a story of status, self -expression or scandals. Business Insider provides you with an overview.

1. Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Offshore Rubens Barrichello II

According to information from the Spiegel, Klaus-Michael Kühne looks like the Elbtower before.

Kühne mentions financial bottlenecks and lack of interest as the main reasons for the uncertainty.

The city of Hamburg is examining the opportunity to accommodate a natural history museum in the Elbtower.

According to Klaus-Michael Kühne, the Hamburger Elbtower is facing out. The billionaire and potential investor, who lives in Switzerland, expressed skepticism about the future of the construction project in the ""Spiegel"": ""I don't think it can be realized"". The main reasons are a lack of financial means and the lack of interest of potential tenants.

Kühne said his participation in the Kühne-Holding was limited to a maximum of 100 million euros. This would result in a large financing gap. ""400 million are needed, but apart from us there is only another investor,"" he said. The project was originally initiated by the insolvent Signa Prime Selection AG by the Austrian entrepreneur René Benko.

The draft for the Elbtower comes from the renowned British architect David Chipperfield. With its planned 245 meters and over 60 floors, the high -rise should become one of the highest buildings in Germany. But in autumn 2023, the executive construction company Adolf Lupp stopped the work - at a height of around 100 meters - because bills had remained open.

Talks are currently underway between the provisional insolvency administrator and an investor consortium under the direction of the real estate entrepreneur Dieter Becken. These negotiations are limited exclusively and time until the end of April. Kühne expressed itself pessimistically: ""It may well be that the Elbtower remains a ruin"", and further: ""In a year or two the city would come to the train and would tear it down.""

In addition to the financing, the question of meaningful use remains open. In order to give the project new impetus, the city of Hamburg is currently considering accommodating the planned natural history museum of the Leibniz community. This project had already been decided together with the University of Hamburg and the city in 2020.

The results of the ongoing examination are to be submitted in April. Mayor Peter Tschentscher and his deputy Katharina Fegebank were generally open to the museum plans - provided they are economically viable. However, Kühne warned: ""The move of the Natural History Museum is not in dry cloths.""

Plans to boost US ship construction are against China-and would also harm Europe. Picture Alliance / CFoto | CFOTO

According to Allianz, Trump's penalty fees for Chinese merchant ships bring consequential damage to Europe.

European shipping companies move into many ships from China and have to pay higher port fees.

The Chinese shipbuilding industry has developed heavily and dominates the global market.

According to the Alliance, the penalty ships built by US President Donald Trump would result in concrete consequential damage to the European economy. Accordingly, European shipping companies would be met immediately, which also obtain many of their merchant ships from the People's Republic.

""Europe continued to build merchant ships under also,"" said Anastasios Leonburg. He is a risk engineer at Allianz Commercial, the company insurer of the Munich Dax Group. ""The Chinese build thousands of ships and maybe ten in the year,"" said the former nautical captain.

Trump provides a million dolle fee to enter US ports

The Trump government wants to revive shipbuilding in the USA. It therefore threatens shipping companies worldwide with immense port fees. Ships of all nations built in China are said to pay up to $ 1.5 million ($ 1.39 million) when a US port. Unlike the tariffs threatened by Donald Trump on cars, this announcement in Europe has not caused too much a stir because it does not directly oppose the EU.

""Shipown will change the costs"", according to Allianz

""The fees for Chinese and China -built ships would generally make the port start more expensive,"" said Leonburg. ""The shipowners will not pay for this out of their own pocket, they have to change the costs."" Reeding companies would also consider three times whether they start US ports. ""Consumers in the USA will quickly feel that.""

Europe has only low shipbuilding capacities

However, even European and German shipping companies cannot do without Chinese ships. ""There are not that many shipyards where you could have your ship built,"" said Leonburg. However, these shipyards existed in China, and they are now better than 10 or 20 years ago. The Chinese shipbuilders had acquired know-how, which is slowly being lost in Germany. ""The big shipping companies therefore order their ships in China.""

The Beijinger leadership has promoted shipbuilding in the past 20 years, so that today the majority of the container and other cargo ships of Chinese and other cargo ships are originally originally. ""Ultimately, the tariffs and the increased port fees meet everyone, including the American consumers and the logistics companies,"" said Leonburg.

Picture alliance / zumapress.com | Jennifer Briggs

A dozen German men have already been in space - but no woman yet. That should change with the Berliner Rabea Rogge. She wants to fly around the poles for days with a SpaceX team.

Rabea Rogge from Berlin could be the first German woman in space. On Tuesday morning, Rogge is scheduled to start Central Europe from the Cape Canaveral space station in the US state of Florida on board a ""Dragon"" capsule and with the help of a Falcon 9 rocket by Tech-billionaire SpaceX from Tech billionaire SpaceX. However, the start could also be shifted at short notice for various reasons.

According to the German Aerospace Center (DLR), twelve German men were so far, but not a German woman in space. There were several candidates and reserve room drivers, but a woman has never really flown.

""I look forward to starting with this incredible crew""

The mission called ""Fram2"" - named after a Norwegian polar research ship from the 19th century - is expected to take around four days. The ""Dragon"" capsule is to fly over the polar regions of the earth on a new orbit. Heavenly lights are to be examined from a height of 425 to 450 kilometers, and according to SpaceX, the first X -ray images of people in space could also be created.

For ""FRAM2"", as in the past, a billionaire has once again commissioned the SpaceX company to carry out a mission for private interest. This time it was the Maltese Chun Wang who has become rich with cryptocurrencies and is also flying along. The filmmaker Jannicke Mikkelsen from Norway and the Polar Guide Eric Philips from Australia are also part of the crew. ""I look forward to starting with this incredible crew,"" wrote the 29-year-old Rogge on the online platform X.

Months of intensive preparation for space

The German is officially involved in the mission as a scientific specialist. She studied electrical engineering and information technology at ETH Zurich. In doing so, she also worked on a concept of a nanosatellite centrifuge in a low orbit. For her doctoral thesis, she switched to the technical and scientific university of Norway.

Rogge and the rest of the crew have been preparing for the mission with intensive training for months. Among other things, various scenarios and the reactions on it were played through in the SpaceX training capsule. There were also medical training and training sessions for the planned scientific experiments. ""The technical background is the easiest for me because I recognize many of the systems from my time as a system engineer in the satellite project,"" Rogge told the German Press Agency a few months ago.

Space training even in Alaska

In addition, the room suits of the four crew members were precisely adjusted and there were exercises for group dynamics, such as a sea kayak training in Alaska. The team welded that together, said Rogge. ""To defy the wilderness in wet clothes for seven days in wet clothing has already brought us together.""

Rogge wants to take a commemorative medal to the flight pioneer Otto Lilienthal (1848-1896) and a small replica of the freedom bell in the town hall in Berlin-Schöneberg-the district in which it was born.

On other astronauts, they admire the calm they radiated, says Rogge. Hopefully she will never experience a stressful situation in space-""but in my opinion the NASA astronauts that I have met so far have always broadcast a lot of version and calm"".

""Huge joy"" in German space travel

From the German space agency in the German Aerospace Center (DLR) it says that you are very happy about the start of Rogge. ""For the first time, a German woman flies into space, not in a state program, but with a private initiative,"" said Walther Pelzer, DLR board member and general director of the German space agency. Tax money would have to be used for the flight nor for the transport of the experiments.

""This shows how much strength can be in private initiatives,"" said Pelzer of the German Press Agency. ""I very much hope that Rabea Rogge and 'Fram2 ′ enthusiasm for the young generation awakens for science and engineering professions.""

Expert Wörner: ""Certainly a great experience""

According to Europe's former space chief Jan Wörner, the mission ""is certainly a great experience for the crew"". He hopes that the increased radiation on the Poles does not lead to health consequences. ""The reason for the Northern Lights is the fact that the magnetic field of the earth concentrates the particles coming from the sun there,"" said Wörner. ""It would be very nice if scientific results were achieved through the mission.""

Picture Alliance / Associated Press | Richard Drew

Luxury watches are often timeless classics that combine style and precision.

Expert Roger Rüegger emphasizes that mechanical watches are made forever and steel clocks are currently popular.

The Rolex Submariner and Patek Philippe Nautilus are considered coveted models with high market prices.

Regardless of whether as a status symbol, value system or as an expression of style awareness: some luxury watches survive trends and generations. They have long been a classic of watchmaking and inspire with timeless design, precision and history.

Business Insider asked experts about the most popular models that not only promise luxury, but also character.

These luxury watches were initially unpopular

Roger Rüegger, watchman of the portal ""Watchtime"", says: ""The taste of luxury watches changes. Mechanical watches are literally made for eternity, and industry is also cyclical.""

Steel clocks of the well -known brands are currently very popular. ""However, we observe a trend towards precious metals and minor diameters. The chance that a brand of the well -known brands will still be en Vogue in ten years is therefore given.""

When buying, especially your own taste counts, says an expert

However, the specialist emphasizes that the popularity of individual models can increase over the years. ""Luxury watches such as the Royal Oak and the Nautilus were not the big racers in the 70s, in the 80s there were still in the expenses. Today the models are considered an absolute top seller.""

Means: ""The best choice is always the clock that comes closest to your own taste and your own expectations."" This could be aware, but there are several other factors. ""The more classic a watch, the greater the chance to have a timeless classic that can still be brought in by a watchmaker in 50 years.""

Getty Images / Olga Rolenko, Collage: Business Insider

According to the personnel consultant Kristine Capek, the key to a successful job interview in competence -based questions, which enable a precise assessment. The question ""Why should we hire you?"" On the other hand, put the applicants under unnecessary pressure. ""The application process is no longer just about a one -sided assessment - rather about getting to know each other at eye level."" Instead of pushing the applicants into a sales situation, companies should specifically ask about their motivation - for example: ""Why did you apply for this position?""

An interview can decide on the professional future - but often these conversations are anything but ideal. Companies present themselves in detail, applicants lose themselves in irrelevant details, and some questions have a daunting than effective.

Kristine Capek knows the typical stumbling blocks. As the founder and managing director of the personnel consultancy ""Ivies"", she has been teaching specialists in the pharmaceutical and biotech industry for over 15 years. She gives career tips on Tikkok as a ""dieheadhunter"". In an interview with Business Insider, she explains what really matters in a successful interview - and what questions should be deterrent.

How does an ideal interview work?

According to Kristine Capek, an ideal interview always starts with small talk. This creates a pleasant atmosphere and relaxes the situation. This is followed by a brief introduction to the company and Hiring management. ""But short and concise, because the focus is on the applicant, not the management or the team,"" emphasizes Capek.

Also read 6 psychological tricks to look more likeable in an interview

""When managers only present themselves for minutes, it is a clear red flag and says a lot about corporate culture."" Instead, the conversation should quickly pass to the applicants - this signal real interest on the part of the company.

The perfect self -presentation in the interview: neither too long nor too short

As an applicant, your self -presentation should take between five and ten minutes. No less, nothing more. You should leave out irrelevant details and concentrate on what is really important for the position, the personnel consultant advises. From the beginning, this creates a targeted connection between your own experience and the new position. However, reality often looks different. Capek knows: ""Many start with their Abitur - and lose their focus.""

Reading I also had over 1000 interviews - this one question should always ask applicants

However, this is not surprising that many companies vote for the first question to applicants very openly. You would say, for example: ""Tell something about yourself."" Instead, companies should target the interview and ask more specific questions. For example: ""Why did you apply for this position? What competencies do you bring with you that enable you for the job?"" The key to a successful interview? Competence -based questions.

Why competence -based questions are the key

For a successful interview, it is crucial that companies define in advance exactly which skills are required for the open position. ""For example, if negotiation skills are required, one could specifically ask for experience with difficult negotiations,"" explains Capek. Applicants could specifically explain how they have already used this competence.

As an applicant, on the other hand, you should not only worship past positions. Focus on the skills and strengths you have developed in previous roles and what added value you could offer in your potentially new role.

This question is a red flag in an interview: ""Why should we hire you?""

Not every question in the interview makes sense - some could (and should) even put off applicants according to the expert. One of them: ""Why should we hire them?"" This question is often asked from above, with the unspoken message: convince us first. The application process is no longer just about a one -sided assessment - rather about getting to know each other at eye level.

Reading you also ask no questions in the interview? Why this is a mistake according to HR and which you should at least make

Capek advises companies to formulate the question differently in order to put the applicants less under pressure. For example: ""Why did you apply for this position?"" This question rather aims at what applicants interested in the position and the company. Unlike the other question, it is not about how well someone can sell. Rather, it is about finding out how well someone is suitable for the open position.

This is how you react confidently to problematic questions in the interview

In one of her Tikok videos, Capek says: ""If you as an applicant are asked, why you should be set, then pack your things together and take a tear.""

But if that is too dramatic for you, for example, you can answer instead: ""I was invited because my qualifications fit the position. I would be happy to explain again which skills I bring with me and how I can bring them in.""

Then you could play the ball back and ask your interlocutors whether it is covered with all skills relevant to the position or whether they would like to talk about further qualifications. ""This remains the conversation professionally and at eye level,"" concludes Capek.

The chief chair in the town hall has been vacant on Wangerooge for months. Picture Alliance/dpa | Hauke-Christian Dittrich

According to information from a job advertisement, the CDU, SPD and Greens are looking for a new island mayor on Wangerooge.

The parties emphasize the shortage of skilled workers and the need for qualified applicants for the administration.

The mayoral election will take place on August 17, after the office has been vacant since autumn 2023.

With a job advertisement, three parties on the East Frisian Island of Wangerooge are looking for candidates for the office of mayor. ""With us, you can design the future in a responsible position,"" says the advertisement, which will be released on Saturday in a local newspaper on the coast and will be printed in other leaves in the coming days.

Behind the campaign are the parties CDU, SPD and Greens from the Wangerooger Inselrat.

The three parties said that the shortage of skilled workers can also be felt on Wangerooge. ""To find new employees with specialist qualification in administrative system for an island, if this is not even possible on the mainland, seems impossible.""

The date for the mayoral election is already determined, it is August 17th. Before the advertisement was switched, an applicant had registered for the office.

What is required by applicants

In the job description of the ad, among other things, the responsible management of the municipal administration and representative tasks are mentioned. At the request of the parties, the applicant should have the future main residence and center of life on Wangerooge for the Rathaus-Spitze. In addition, a university degree or a career qualification for the upscale administrative service and relevant professional experience are expected.

The Lower Saxony Local Constitution Act also mentions some formal requirements: Mayor can therefore become a German citizenship or that of an EU member state. The election time is 8 years.

Mayor search by job advertisement has already worked on the island

The island has had good experiences lately with public job advertisements. In 2018, the three parties had already searched for suitable candidates for the mayor with newspaper advertisements after the then town hall boss died surprisingly.

With success: Marcel Fangohr, who was in the meantime, was also found with the help of this advertisement. Most recently, the island made headlines nationwide when a job application for the job of the lighthouse keeper went viral on the Internet.

Since Mayor Fangohr resigned in autumn 2023 after a dispute with the local council, the office has been vacant. Since then, the head of the spa and general representative of the mayor, Rieka Beewen, has been temporarily leading the island administration.

Because it was difficult for the island with around 1100 inhabitants to find employees for the administration at all, Wangerooge initially considered joining a municipality on the mainland. However, this plan was rejected, so that the mayor is now elected.

Why it's not your fault,https://www.businessinsider.de/karriere/kein-erfolg-bei-der-jobsuche-warum-es-nicht-eure-schuld-ist/,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 08:02:29 GMT","The job search should be viewed from an expert view like a full -time job. Miodrag Ignjatovic/Getty Images

If you don't get a job at the moment, this may not be due to your talent or your experience.

Employers may be flooded with applicants and cannot have an interview with everyone.

The companies have become more careful when hiring employees and may also have too few staff when it comes to talent.

Many people are currently looking for a job. While this is good news for the employer, it is a bit more difficult for job seekers.

If you blame yourself because you have not found a job despite the active job search, you should take the factors into account that are outside of your control. The labor market is more competitive and the willingness to hire is lower than it was a few years ago.

Experienced recruiters and labor market analysts said in an interview with Business Insider that these factors are that many people apply for the same position. There are also not enough employees who check the applications. Finally, the demand in the area you apply is low.

""We are in a situation in which it is more difficult for people to find a new job because the balance of power has shifted again in the direction of the employer,"" said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at Glassdoor, and added that the attitudes go slowly and are more reminiscent of the 2010s than the booming market a few years ago.

Kathleen Nolan, who has been working as a technical recruiter for about seven years, knows how hard the labor market is. In a LinkedIn posting, she said that she assured a applicant to whom she rejected it that it was on the job market and not to him.

Nolan is of the opinion that companies ""only open up positions if they are really needed and they do their best so that the number of employees is no more than necessary.""

""If you have never had any problems getting a job, and suddenly you have some, you can look at it differently and suddenly think: 'I'm the problem',"" said Nolan. ""You have to see what happens around you.""

Some industries have more options than others. Zhao said that the healthcare system was not as strongly dependent on the economic cycle as other sectors. Cory Stahne, economist at Indeed Hiring Lab, said that many attitudes are made in this sector, while in the tech industry and other areas for knowledge workers are not as many attitudes.

""You can't choose what time you are on the job market, but you can choose which part of the labor market you focus on,"" said Zhao.

Too many applicants for a job

For the available positions, employers may not have enough hands to go through or answer all applicants. Nolan said that the talent pacification and similar tasks during the pandemic have suffered a setback and that companies did not increase these teams to the earlier level.

""They have fewer people to go through more résumés and fill fewer positions, but it's still a lot of work,"" she said.

Bonnie Dilber, who has been working as a recruitment for about ten years, said that her current employer, a software company, had to put back an application for a job with a few vacancies after 700 applicants had received within a few days after the announcement. Dilber said that many of the applicants were well qualified for the position.

""We simply had to find out that many people who really have the necessary skills and could probably fill the position well not even get an interview because there are so many people who are also on the market and apply for a small number of jobs,"" she said.

There is no patent recipe to be successful when looking for a job

There are some things you can do to speed up the application process.

Dilber advises against applying for each open position and instead concentrating on the places for which you are ""well qualified"". ""Mass applications harm people because they apply with inferior applications that cannot exist in a competitive applicant tool,"" she says.

Nolan does not believe that there is a clear formula to get out when looking for a job or get the first interview. However, she recommends strategic networking, for example contacting existing contacts and with people who admire her in your work area.

A LinkedIn profile can help you find a job

""Something that is often underestimated is the following: you have to ask for what you want by publishing it. Be it on LinkedIn or by writing an email to people you know in the industry,"" she said.

Nolan said that your LinkedIn profile should be a version of your résumé, as HR managers tend to check it in addition to the submitted CVs.

Apart from the typical routine work when looking for a job, Nolan advises to be patient and take care of himself. She said that the application for a workplace can be a full -time job. ""Just like a full -time job, it is important that you sit down parameters so that you don't burn,"" she said.

It is difficult to say how the situation on the job market will develop, not even at short notice. Nolan is confident that the situation one day will improve. ""We have experienced difficult situations on the market before,"" she says.",businessinsider

According to an article by Lorraine K. Lee on ""CNBC Make it"", the phrase ""I think"" weakens your own meaning.

Instead, she recommends using ""I recommend"" to work more convincingly.

Lee works with Fortune-500 company and helps to strengthen leadership skills.

There is a phrase that slips over our lips every now and then. Today I used it twice. In a message to my girlfriends I wrote ""I think the film is running in the cinema during the day"" and to a colleague I said: ""I think the text will be finished until noon.""

At first glance, the phrase “I believe” looks harmless - especially if it only occurs occasionally. But those who use the wording too often, especially in the professional context, unconsciously weaken their own meaningfulness and appear less confident.

At least that's what Lorraine K. Lee, Keynote speaker and CEO from Rise Learning Solutions says. In a article for ""CNBC Make IT"" she explains which phrase you should use instead if you are unsure.

Don't say ""I think"", but ""I recommend""

According to Lorraine K. Lee, the wording ""I think"" is a perfect example of the so -called ""minimizing language"". According to this, individual words or formulations can weaken entire statements and make you look less convincing. ""Other common examples of this are only, maybe or an exaggerated sorry,"" said Lee on ""CNBC Make IT"".

Lee is a keynote speaker, author and works with Fortune-500 companies, teams and individuals to strengthen their leadership skills, influence and effectiveness. Your customers include Zoom, Cisco, LinkedIn or McKinsey & Company.

Lee knows from experience: Formulations such as ""maybe"" or ""I think"" look polite. But: ""In a professional context, you can water down your credibility and lead to your ideas more easily dismissed."" Instead, the expert recommends the phrase ""I recommend"".

So don't say: ""I think I would move the deadline"" or: ""I think we should prioritize this project."" Instead, ""I recommend moving the deadline"" or: ""I recommend prioritizing this project.""

According to Lee, the first sentence blade hesitantly, while the second decided and sound -oriented. She writes: ""Even if the statement is identical in terms of content, I recommend 'I recommend' more weight - because it looks more like a suggestion with substance and not like a casual thought.""

What if you are unsure?

But what if you are actually unsure? In these cases, the phrase can also serve ""I recommend"" - but with a small addition, said Lee on ""CNBC Make IT"".

So, for example, says: ""Based on what I have seen, I recommend ..."" or ""If I look at the data, I would recommend ..."". In the way, your statement remains strong, but still leave room for discussions.

Finally, Lee advises that you should watch closely in the future to make out linguistic patterns. Listen carefully, read each of your slack or team message again and correct yourself, should a ""I think"" slide into one or the other sentence. ""If you 'believe' I recommend 'I recommend', you will look more convincing in the job - and more confident in everyday life,"" concludes Lee.",businessinsider

https://businessinsider.com,Longevity: I tested my biological age - and was disappointed,https://www.businessinsider.de/leben/longevity-ich-habe-mein-biologisches-alter-getestet-und-war-enttaeuscht/,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 07:40:41 GMT","According to Andrea Caletti, the head of the Longevity Clinic Aiva, the Bio Age Test can provide information on which follow-up examinations or prevention measures could make sense. Aiva / Neotes / Graphics: Can Yavuz

Our author visited a Longevity clinic in Berlin to test her biological age, her epigenetic fitness and risk of diseases such as cancer and diabetes. The test has shown that her biological age is below her actual and that, for example, she achieves better values ​​in nutrition than comparative parties of her age. According to Longevity doctor Evelyne Bischof, the previous tests for biological age are generally solid, but still have only a limited meaning. It therefore warns of an overinterpretation.

Most people appreciate my age at almost 20. I am actually 27 years old. Nevertheless, I have to show my ID regularly-whether on the wine shelf in the supermarket or-no joke-if I want to buy my favorite chocolate ice cream with rum. There is not even real alcohol in it, but that's a different story.

So if I look so young on the outside - how old am I internally? This question has not let me go since I heard of the Longevity hype for the first time. People like the Tech millionaire Bryan Johnson invest a whole assets to reverse their biological age-i.e. the age that reflects the condition of our cells and metabolic processes regardless of the date of birth. I have now had how old my own body is tested in a Berlin Longevity Clinic.

This is how the biological age is tested

The Arona Institute for Vitality and Aesthetics (AIVA) is located on the health campus in Berlin-Biesdorf. Here, patients can claim different therapies for a longer, healthier life - or, thanks to plastic surgery, at least have to cheat themselves out. Andrea Caletti is head of the Longevity Clinic. During my visit, he gave me the Bio Age test from the company Neotes.

According to the company, the test is based on the ""epigenetic methylation profile"" (see info box). With the help of a special chip, he reads about 935,000 jobs of the DNA and is intended to make statements about your health.

However, this is not just about ""information about the biological age, but also about the individual risk of suffering from certain diseases,"" explains Caletti. Among other things, the risk of cancer, the risk of coronary heart diseases and your general risk of mortality.

What is DNA methylation? The Bio Age Test of Neotes is based on the analysis of Methylation patterns of the DNA. This can be explained like this: Our DNA consists of a long sequence of four building blocks (the so -called bases: adenin, cytosine, guanin and thymine). Methylation means that a tiny molecule - a so -called methyl group (CH₃, i.e. a carbon atom with three hydrogen atoms) - is attached at certain points. This methyl group acts like a small switch: it can cause a gene to be less active or even completely switched off. The DNA itself remains unchanged - so it is not a mutation. But the ""operating instructions"" of the body are provided with a kind of marker at certain points. These chemical markings change in the course of life and allow conclusions to be drawn on how old our body really is. This is exactly what the test uses: it looks at how and where these methylations occur on the DNA and calculates the biological age.

The process is uncomplicated. First you have to register your test kit online and fill out a questionnaire. For example, you provide information about how you feed on whether you smoke or suffer from autoimmune diseases.

Next, you carry out the test: a small prick in your finger, then give a few drops of blood to the trial extension card and send the test in the pre -franked envelope. You get the result and your biological age about four weeks later.

If you want to take the test, you have to dig deep into your pocket. The basic version is available for 299 euros. The premium version, which also examines fitness parameters, costs a whopping 935 euros. As a journalist, I was able to try out the premium version as part of the reporting free of charge.

I cut off well in many areas - but not in one

To discuss my results, I visited the Aiva again. Here it was shown that I am about a year younger than my chronological age. Admittedly, I am not entirely satisfied with it. Secretly I had hoped to be much younger - maybe in early 20, just like many people appreciate me anyway. After all, I mostly eat healthy, do not smoke and generally do not drink alcohol. In short: I had somehow hoped for more youthfulness on paper. But at least my greatest concern is that I am actually 80.

Andrea Caletti finds my result ""very good"". According to the test, my fitness is average. But in terms of my diet, I am better compared to the same age.

My risk assessment is also interesting for my biological age. ""Based on your DNA, we can say: You have a reduced risk of cancer by about five percent,"" said Caletti. That is not a huge difference, but still positive. I am also below average when it comes to risk of cardiovascular diseases. And ""For diabetes mellitus, the test shows a percent reduced risk,"" I find out.

According to the Neotes bioage test, my risk of mortality is eight percent lower compared to peers. Neotes

However, a test category ensures frowns - and not only for myself. Because obviously my telomer length is below average.

""Short telomeres are considered a marker for cell aging,"" explains the longevity doctor Evelyne Bischof. Their length is influenced, among other things, by the genetic predisposition, sleep quality and the stress level. However, according to Bishop, they are just one of many so -called ""Hallmarks of Aging"" (characteristics of aging) and not only decisive. ""A bad value does not have to mean a bad forecast,"" the doctor soothes me.

Andrea Caletti also gives the all -clear. Overall, my results are good, so there is no need to worry.

Telomeres: Your task and role in the aging process are telomeres like the small plastic caps at the ends of laces - only at the ends of our chromosomes. You have an important protective function: you prevent important genetic information from being lost in cell division. With every cell division, the telomeres become a small piece shorter. If they are so short that the genes they protect could be damaged, the cells stop sharing and renewing themselves. This is one of the mechanisms behind aging. Short telomers are therefore considered a marker for cell aging and are associated with a higher risk of chronic diseases.



How meaningful are the test results?

The results of the test are exciting - but how reliable are they really? According to Andrea Caletti, the test helps to get a first picture of the health of a person, ""without taking invasive measures"". It serves early detection and can provide information on which follow -up examinations or prevention measures could be useful.

Evelyne Bischof also confirms that the test is an entry option, for example for the individualization of therapies or as a course of the course in lifestyle changes. Nevertheless, she notes: ""The previous tests for biological age are generally solid, but not maximum precise.""

The worldwide is continuously working on improvements in epigenetic watches. In addition, different providers work with different algorithms - that's why the results can vary greatly. It is important not to look at the test isolated, but to classify them together with a doctor.

In addition, there is a risk of overinterpretation: ""Many use good values ​​as a free ticket,"" says Bischof. A ""good"" biological age is not a guarantee that there is no risks - and no replacement for classic preventive examinations.

Other people often appreciate me younger than I actually am. Stefanie Michallek

Is the test for biological age worth it?

299 or 935 euros for an analysis of neotes are a lot of money. Andrea Caletti knows that too. ""The test is expensive, but it can deliver important warning signals,"" he comments. And it is precisely these warning signals - not whether you are one or two years younger according to the test. However, everyone has to decide for themselves whether the assessment of biological age, epigenetic fitness and disease risks are worth the money.

The fact is: the test does not provide a specific medical diagnosis. Similar analyzes from other providers also cost between 200 and 700 euros. For many, such a test can be an impetus to change - or a motivating intermediate stand on the way to a healthier lifestyle.

Anyone who deals with their body and is curious about how they are “from the inside” can benefit from the Bio Age Test. On the other hand, if you hope for medical facts or therapy recommendations, you should be aware: the test is a supplementary tool - not a substitute for the family doctor.

Reading Bryan Johnson also wants to stay young forever and leads strictly - the millionaire treats this snacks instead of fast food

If I had not been to the Longevity Clinic as a journalist, but as a private person, I would probably not have had the test carried out for budget reasons. Nevertheless, I am happy about the knowledge that the test brought me. Knowing that my biological age is below my actual, calmed me down and showed me that I obviously do a lot right.

I found the evaluation of my individual disease risks particularly exciting, all of which are slightly reduced. This is not an all -clear, but a small lead. And for me an impetus to keep it - or to expand it.",businessinsider

A unilateral partial ceasefire to facilitate earthquake relief efforts was announced on Saturday by Myanmar's shadow National Unity Government, which coordinates the popular struggle against the ruling military. The country's death toll from the disaster soared to 1,644. The figure was a sharp rise compared to the 1,002 announced just hours earlier, highlighting the difficulty of confirming casualties over a widespread region and the likelihood that the numbers will continue to grow from Friday's 7.7 magnitude quake. The number of injured increased to 3,408, while the missing figure rose to 139. The number of dead also rises in Thailand In neighboring Thailand, the death toll increased to 10. The quake rocked the greater Bangkok area, home to around 17 million people, and other parts of the country. Many places in the north reported damage, but the only casualties were reported in Bangkok, the capital. Nine of the fatalities were at the site of the collapsed high-rise under construction near Bangkok's Chatuchak market, while 78 people were still unaccounted for. On Saturday, more heavy equipment was brought in to move the tons of rubble, but hope was fading among friends and relatives. ""I was praying that that they had survived, but when I got here and saw the ruin — where could they be? said 45-year-old Naruemol Thonglek, sobbing as she awaited news about her partner, who is from Myanmar, and five friends who worked at the site. Aid efforts in Myanmar hindered by damage to airports In Myanmar, rescue efforts so far are focused on the major stricken cities of Mandalay, the country's No. 2 city, and Naypyitaw, the capital. But even though teams and equipment have been flown in from other nations, they are hindered by damage to airports. Satellite photos from Planet Labs PBC analyzed by The Associated Press show that the earthquake toppled the air traffic control tower at Naypyitaw International Airport as if sheered from its base. It wasn't immediately clear if there had been any casualties from its collapse.

Myanmar's civil war also an obstacle Another major complication is the civil war roiling much of the country, including the quake-affected areas. In 2001, the military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, sparking what has since turned into significant armed resistance. Government forces have lost control of much of Myanmar, and many places are incredibly dangerous or simply impossible for aid groups to reach. More than 3 million people have been displaced by the fighting and nearly 20 million are in need, according to the United Nations. The interplay of politics and disaster was demonstrated Saturday night, when Myanmar's shadow National Unity Government announced a unilateral partial ceasefire to facilitate earthquake relief efforts. It said its armed wing, the People's Defense Force, will implement a two-week pause in offensive military operations starting Sunday in earthquake-affected areas and it would also collaborate with the U.N. and international nongovernmental organizations ""to ensure security, transportation, and the establishment of temporary rescue and medical camps,"" in the areas it controls.

Extensive damage in cities

The earthquake struck midday Friday with an epicenter not far from Mandalay, followed by several aftershocks, including one measuring 6.4. It sent buildings in many areas toppling to the ground, buckled roads and caused bridges to collapse. In Naypyitaw, crews worked Saturday to repair damaged roads, while electricity, phone and internet services remained down for most of the city. The earthquake brought down many buildings, including multiple units that housed government civil servants, but that section of the city was blocked off by authorities on Saturday. An initial report on earthquake relief efforts issued Saturday by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said that it's allocating $5 million from a Central Emergency Response Fund for ""life-saving assistance."" The immediate planned measures include a convoy of 17 cargo trucks carrying critical shelter and medical supplies from China that is expected to arrive on Sunday, it said. It noted the severe damage or destruction of many health facilities, and warned of a ""severe shortage of medical supplies is hampering response efforts, including trauma kits, blood bags, anaesthetics, assistive devices, essential medicines, and tents for health workers.""

https://cnbc.com,Novo Nordisk's diabetes pill slashes risk of cardiovascular complications by 14% after four years,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/29/novo-nordisks-diabetes-pill-rybelsus-slashes-cardiovascular-risk.html,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Flags with the logos of Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk, maker of the blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss treatments Ozempic and Wegovy are pictures while the company presents the annual report at Novo Nordisk in Bagsvaerd, Denmark, on February 5, 2025.

Novo Nordisk on Saturday said its diabetes pill Rybelsus showed cardiovascular benefits in a late-stage trial, paving the way for it to become a new treatment option for people living with diabetes and heart disease.

The pill lowered the risk of cardiovascular-related death, heart attack and stroke by 14% compared to a placebo after four years on average in patients with diabetes and established heart disease, with or without chronic kidney disease. The Danish drugmaker presented the results on Rybelsus, which is already approved for Type 2 diabetes, at the American College of Cardiology's Annual Scientific Session in Chicago.

Novo Nordisk has already applied in the U.S. and EU to expand the pill's approval to include lowering the risk of serious cardiovascular complications, Stephen Gough, the company's global chief medical officer, said in an interview.

Rybelsus is the once-daily oral formulation of Novo Nordisk's blockbuster diabetes injection Ozempic, which is taken once a week. Both treatments, as well as the company's weekly weight loss injection Wegovy, contain the active ingredient semaglutide.

Wegovy in March 2024 won U.S. approval for slashing the risk of major cardiovascular events in adults with cardiovascular disease and who are obese or overweight. But the pill data presented on Saturday suggests that patients who are hesitant to take injections, such as those who are afraid of needles, could soon access treatment in a more convenient way.

""We know not everybody wants an injection, whether it is painful or not, they want the option of an oral medication,"" Gough told CNBC. ""We provide that option, that you can have one or the other, depending on what the patients and the healthcare professional think is right in that joint discussion.""

The data comes as a slate of other drugmakers, including Eli Lilly, work to develop oral GLP-1s for diabetes, weight loss and other conditions, such as sleep apnea.

The phase three trial examined just over 9,600 patients 50 years and older who received either Rybelsus or placebo, both on top of their standard treatment regimen, for an average of just under four years. Nearly half of all patients received medications called SGLT2 inhibitors, which are primarily used to lower blood sugar in adults with Type 2 diabetes, at some point during the trial.

By the end of the trial, 12% of people taking Rybelsus and 13.8% of those taking placebo experienced cardiovascular-related death, heart attack or stroke. That represents a 14% overall lower risk among those who took Rybelsus.

Researchers said that the reduced risk is in line with the cardiovascular benefits observed in eight previous trials involving injectable GLP-1s, which include semaglutide and other popular medications, according to a release from the American College of Cardiology. GLP-1s mimic certain gut hormones to tamp down appetite and regulate blood sugar, but also have other effects such as reducing inflammation.

Rybelsus helped lower the risk of non-fatal heart attacks by 26% compared to the placebo, which was ""the primary driver"" of the overall reduction of risk for cardiovascular complications in the trial, the release said. The pill also slashed the risk of non-fatal strokes by 12% and cardiovascular-related death by 7% compared to placebo.

There was no significant difference between the Rybelsus and placebo groups in outcomes related to kidney function, the release added. But the trial was ""clearly"" designed to examine the cardiovascular rather than kidney benefits of the pill, Gough said.

Ozempic is already approved to treat chronic kidney disease in diabetes patients.

The most common side effects reported in the study were gastrointestinal issues, such as nausea, diarrhea and constipation, which rarely led patients to stop taking Rybelsus, according to the release. Those symptoms are consistent with the side effects of injectable semaglutide.

Similar results were seen across all subgroups of patients – by age, sex and among people with different health conditions at the start of the trial, the release said.

Unlike its injectable counterparts, Rybelsus must be taken on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes before breakfast with a small amount of water. Despite those requirements, the study offers ""reassurance that patients were able to take the drug as directed and reap cardiovascular health benefits from it,"" said Dr. Darren McGuire, professor of medicine at UT Southwestern Medical Center and the study's first author.",cnbc

A new type of medication may help lower blood pressure in people with uncontrolled hypertension, researchers reported Saturday at the annual meeting of American College of Cardiology in Chicago.

In a pivotal Phase 2b clinical trial, patients who took the experimental medication lorundrostat along with two or three currently available hypertension drugs saw a decrease in systolic blood pressure (the upper number) that was 8 points greater than what was seen in patients who got a placebo. The study will be published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

""This new potential therapy for hypertension is exciting,"" said the study's lead author, Dr. Luke Laffin, co-director of the Center for Blood Pressure Disorders at the Cleveland Clinic's Heart, Vascular and Thoracic Institute. ""We do a poor job controlling blood pressure in the U.S.""

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly half of adults in the U.S. have hypertension; among them, less than 1 in 4 have their blood pressure under control.

Hypertension is diagnosed when a person has a blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg or higher. A systolic measurement between 120 and 129 mm Hg is considered to be elevated. A normal measurement is 120/80 mm Hg or below.

Uncontrolled hypertension — which Laffin defined as a measurement of 130/80 mm Hg or higher even with medication — is linked to a higher risk of heart attacks, strokes, heart failure and kidney failure.

Among patients taking medication for hypertension, the rate of control is 60% to 70%, said Dr. Ajay Kirtane, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City, who wasn't involved with the research. That leaves 30% to 40% of patients who need another option.

Lorundrostat is meant for this group of patients. The drug, part of a class called aldosterone synthase inhibitors, works by blocking the adrenal glands' synthesis of a hormone called aldosterone, which controls the amount of salt retained by the body. When aldosterone is reduced, so are salt levels and therefore blood pressure.

To test the safety and efficacy of lorundrostat, Laffin and his colleagues recruited 285 adults with uncontrolled hypertension whose average age was 60. More than half (53%) of the participants were Black.

Black patients are among those most at risk, Laffin said. About 55% of Black adults have high blood pressure, according to the American Heart Association.

Dr. Oscar Cingolani, director of the hypertension program at Johns Hopkins Medicine, said the inclusion of so many Black patients is ""a big, big thing,"" noting that ""African Americans … tend to be more responsive to this pathway.""

All of the patients in the trial were already taking a mix of blood pressure drugs. When the trial began, the researchers standardized those treatments by putting all of the patients on two or three specific medications. Three weeks later, they randomly assigned the participants to get either a placebo or one of two doses of lorundrostat for the next 12 weeks.

At three points, the participants wore a blood pressure cuff for a 24-hour period: at the beginning, four weeks after treatment started and then again at 12 weeks.

Participants taking the lower dose of lorundrostat, 50 milligrams, plus standard medications saw an average systolic blood pressure decrease of 15.4 points, while the group receiving the placebo plus standard drugs saw a decrease of 7.4 points — so the drug-related decrease in blood pressure after accounting for the placebo response was 8 points.

Increasing the dose of the drug didn't improve the results.

While the placebo response may seem high, it's most likely due to people being in a study and having the attention of health professionals, making them more scrupulous about taking their medications, experts said.

With a decrease of 8 points, say from 170 to 162, ""that is the range where you would in a longer-term study see reductions in heart attacks and strokes,"" said Dr. Deepak Bhatt, director of the Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital in New York City.

Aldosterone synthase inhibitors are a new class of drugs, some of which are closer to being considered for approval by the Food and Drug Administration than others, Bhatt said. One other, baxdrostat, is currently in Phase 3 trials.

Lorundrostat has shown promise in the three levels of clinical trials needed for approval. The last one, the Phase 3 trial, is completed, though the results haven't been published yet, Laffin said. The researchers are working on the trials with drugmaker Mineralys Therapeutics, which funded the trials.

The drug could potentially be available within 12 to 18 months, Laffin said.

Patients in the trial who got lorundrostat were more likely than those who got the placebo to develop high potassium levels. That's something patients' doctors would need to keep an eye out for, Bhatt said, because it can lead to abnormal heart rhythms.

Cingolani, of Johns Hopkins, said he would like to see long-term studies on the new medication and also ones that could compare lorundrostat to an older medication that works by blocking the receptor for aldosterone.",cnbc

U.S. Vice President JD Vance on Friday accused Denmark of underinvesting the security of Greenland and claimed other European allies had failed to keep pace with defense spending. President Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to gain control of the autonomous Danish territory, describing the prospect as an ""absolute necessity"" for U.S. national security. ""Denmark hasn't done a good job at keeping Greenland safe,"" Vance told servicemembers at the Pituffik Space Base in Greenland on Friday. ""We know that too often our allies in Europe have not kept pace, they haven't kept pace with military spending and Denmark has not kept pace in devoting the resources necessary to keep this base, to keep our troops, and in my view, to keep the people of Greenland safe from a lot of very aggressive incursions from Russia, China and other nations with interest in this area,"" Vance told reporters. The vice president said the island was important because Pituffik would be the first to alert the U.S. if a missile was fired from an enemy country or enemy submarine at the U.S.

""We know that Russia and China and other nations are taking an extraordinary interest in Arctic passageways and Arctic naval routes and indeed in the minerals of the Arctic territories. We need to ensure that America is leading in the Arctic because we know that if America doesn't, other nations will fill the gap,"" he said. Following Vance's visit, Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said his country was ""open to criticism"" but that they did not ""appreciate the tone in which it's being delivered."" ""This is not how you speak to your close allies,"" he said in a video message shared on the social media platform X. ""We respect that the United States needs a greater military presence in Greenland, as Vice President Vance mentioned this evening. We, Denmark and Greenland, are very much open to discussing this with you,"" Rasmussen said.

'Far fetched' rhetoric

Vance's visit comes as Trump reiterated earlier this week his desire to take over Greenland for national and international security purposes, saying the U.S. would ""go as far as we have to go."" ""We need Greenland and the world needs us to have Greenland, including Denmark,"" he said, referring to the island which is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark. Danish Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen condemned Trump's comments, saying the ""far-fetched"" rhetoric was a further escalation from the U.S. Both the governments of Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly voiced opposition to Trump's proposals, with Mute Egede, the outgoing prime minister of Greenland, earlier this month saying: ""Don't keep treating us with disrespect. Enough is enough."" Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin this week warned that it would be a ""profound mistake"" to dismiss Trump's effort ""as some preposterous talk by the new U.S. administration.""

Putin said the U.S. had previously offered to buy Greenland and had plans to control the territory ""as far back as the 1860s."" ""In short, the United States has serious plans regarding Greenland. These plans have long historical roots, as I have just mentioned, and it is obvious that the United States will continue to consistently advance its geo-strategic, military-political and economic interests in the Arctic,"" the Russian president said. The U.S.' initial plan for a delegation of officials to visit the island this week was met with stark criticism from leaders in Denmark and Greenland. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen claimed the plans were creating ""unacceptable pressure.""

https://cnbc.com,Costco's not-so secret weapon: How Kirkland Signature is driving growth and profits,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/29/costco-not-so-secret-weapon-how-kirkland-drives-growth-and-profits.html,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","A weaker environment for consumer spending is playing right into one of Costco 's biggest strengths: Kirkland Signature. A string of recent consumer and industry data shows that adoption of private label products has been accelerating, including at Costco, where its store brand is becoming a larger part of its overall sales. That's great news for Costco investors because those Kirkland Signature products tend to carry a higher margin than other branded items — and Wall Street wants to see the company become more profitable to help boost earnings, without sacrificing its identity. ""Costco, specifically, has been a leader in the private label arena with its Kirkland Signature brand,"" UBS analyst Michael Lasser told CNBC at the firm's consumer and retail conference in New York City earlier this month. ""It's found newer and newer ways to design and create products under the Kirkland Signature brand, and the consumer has responded well to it,"" added Lasser, who has a buy rating on Costco stock. The economic picture has added to the appeal of store bands. In a recent survey, investment bank Stifel found consumer spending intentions in February and March weakened from where they were in January, even though they overall remained positive. A clear bright spot in the survey: willingness to spend on private label brands remained elevated. About 48% of respondents said they're planning to buy more private label, based on a two-survey average, which is three percentage points above the 12-month average. In general, the respondents indicated they're shopping most frequently at the largest retailers, including Costco, Walmart and Target. The Stifel data suggests a yearslong trend has not run its course with value-conscious shoppers whose budgets have been strained by years of high inflation. In 2024, sales of store brand rose to a record $271 billion, up 3.9% on an annual basis, according to the Private Label Manufacturer's Association . National brands, meanwhile, saw a 1% increase in sales in 2024, to roughly $1.03 trillion. Store brands accounted for 20.7% of dollars spent in 2024, a record share of the market, according to the PLMA. That's up from 19.1% in 2021. At Costco, Kirkland Signature continues to grow at a faster pace than its business as a whole —a positive for profitability while still being able to offer customers a great deal. Executives have said Kirkland Signature products ""average 20% value"" to the national brand. And yet, as the mix of Kirkland Signature sales grows, ""it definitely creates some overall tailwind in our margin overall,"" CFO Gary Millerchip said last fall on an earnings. Costco does not offer up private label penetration as an official metric, but it's periodically discussed on earnings calls. Kirkland Signature products represented about a third of Costco's sales, CEO Ron Vachris said in December on its first-quarter earnings call. On the prior in September, he said it was in the ""high 20s"" percentage — evidence of its growing slice of the pie. The majority of Costco's private label sales fall into its ""food and sundries"" category, Vachris has said, which includes dry groceries, items in coolers and freezers, and liquor, among others. Fresh foods — meat, produce, bakery and the service deli — are in their own category, as are non-foods such as electronics, appliances, clothes and more. Joe Feldman, analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, estimates Kirkland's penetration has been increasing by roughly half a percent or so each year. ""The brand continues to grow at a solid rate, generally in line to a little faster than the company average,"" he said. Costco's net sales in 2024 were $249.6 billion. Using Vachris' previous ""high 20s"" disclosure, that means Kirkland Signature sales might have been somewhere in the range of $67.4 billion to $74.6 billion. The low end of the range is derived from a 27% estimate, while the high end is based on a 29.9% estimate. For perspective, that far exceeds Coca-Cola's revenue of $47 billion in 2024, and it is more than three times Colgate-Palmolive's $20 billion in annual sales last year — granted the products sold by each company is not an apples-to-apples comparison. While inflation may make certain shoppers more receptive to store brands, part of the story also is about the products themselves. ""Historically, private label in the U.S. has been synonymous with inexpensive,"" UBS' Lasser said, with consumers often turning to store brands when budgets are tight. However, he said that retailers like Costco are now making quality products considered on par with the brand names — yet sold at a lower price. It's this ""elevation of the quality of private label that has helped to stimulate adoption,"" Lasser said. In other words, people are viewing private label brands as just as good or better than national peers in both quality and value. ""We always like to say consumers are 'trading up' when they buy Costco's Kirkland Signature products instead of brand names,"" said Jeff Marks, the Club's director of portfolio analysis. Recent data backs up Lasser and Marks' comments. In a February survey of roughly 1,000 U.S. adults, roughly three out of four respondents said private label products are just as good as the name brand alternatives, according to the Ipsos Consumer Tracker . The appeal extends across income brackets, Ipsos found in a separate, mid-September survey. A third of respondents with household incomes above both $100,000 and $125,000 indicated they were upping their spending on private label. That's almost on par with the 37% of respondents making between $50,000 and $100,000 who said they were increasing their store-brand purchases. How Costco does it Costco has successfully built up Kirkland Signature's reputation over the years, but the company is hardly resting on its laurels — whether that's on the kinds of products being offered, their design and, crucially, the price. Executives frequently talk up their close relationships with suppliers in these areas, and how important continuous innovation is to the brand. Consider the case of Kirkland Signature diapers. On its earnings call earlier this month, finance chief Millerchip highlighted improvements to the product after working with a new supplier. It now has a longer and thicker absorbent layer, a softer outer cover and twice the waistband stretch, he said. ""As well as improving the quality of this item, we were able to increase the value by 11%."" A common refrain with Costco is that it's the last retailer to raise prices when costs increase and the first to lower them when they can. Some Kirkland Signature products have seen price reductions recently, including a three-liter bottle of refined olive oil ($27.99 from $29.99) and a two pack of organic peanut butter ($9.99 from $11.49), according to Millerchip. Vachris, the CEO, said the biggest growth opportunity for Kirkland Signature is in non-food categories. That is an area where loyalty to name brands is considered to be strong. However, Vachris pointed to successful examples, such as motor oil, that support their push. Kirkland Signature motor oil has become the top-selling motor oil in all Costco warehouses, Vachris said, and its golf balls have also gained traction in a competitive, brand-loyal category. Still, Costco is ""not in a race to develop hundreds of Kirkland items,"" Vachris said on the March earnings call. ""We look at it more of a strategic, item-by-item basis that when there's an item with an opportunity, then that's when they will go after that,"" he said. Not every pursuit is a success. Costco is quick to remove underperforming items that don't resonate with members or work with suppliers to make a better product. A clear example of this strategy is Kirkland Signature's beer offerings, Vachris detailed during the company's annual meeting in January. In 2014, Costco launched Kirkland Signature Light Beer that saw moderate but underwhelming sales, he said. A year later, Costco tried Kirkland Craft Beer, but it didn't meet expectations either. Last year, though, a Kirkland Signature Lager debuted, which has ""really hit the mark,"" said Vachris. ""Our members have spoken and the sales are outstanding in this item,"" the CEO said. ""So, very exciting seeing the tenacity of the buyers continuing to work on things until they get the right item."" Investors should be excited, too. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long COST.

In 2022, Plaisance came across an online listing for a three-bedroom, two-bathroom condo located inside an old bank. The apartment was 3,500 square feet, split between the first floor and a basement. ""The first time I saw the listing, I freaked out,"" she tells CNBC Make It. ""I knew it was meant for us, but I kept calm because, you know, the house market is a bit crazy.""

When Plaisance first saw the property listing, she knew it would be the perfect place for her and her boyfriend. Marianne Plaisance

At first, the old bank was listed for 900,000 CAD or $625,720 USD, but by their first visit to see the space in person, the price had been reduced to $521,433 USD. ""The listing was up for a long time. Nobody seemed interested in buying the property,"" she says. The couple submitted an offer of $500,576 and it was accepted. Their mortgage is $2,655 a month and they pay $4,080 a year in property taxes. Additional expenses include $275 in utilities, $92 for Wi-Fi and $70 for parking a month. ""The bank is on the main floor of the building. The other condos on top [don't] look at all like what it looks in here,"" she says. ""I got the bank of the block.""

The condo still has some of the bank's original design details, like the marble floors, crown molding, safety deposit boxes, and a vault, which Plaisance uses as her walk-in closet. ""It's filled with everything I love, It's my dream closet,"" she says.

""It was a beautiful blank canvas for me.""

Plaisance, a content creator, has a background in graphic design and commercial photography, so finding a home like the old bank was a dream come true. ""When I found this place, it was a beautiful canvas for me,"" she says. ""I always envisioned myself living in a very artistic, creative, colorful, unique space. So, to have this place as my adult house is so cool to me.""

As a self-professed ""intentional maximalist,"" Plaisance transformed the dark gray and baby blue space into her colorful dream home. Some of her prized possessions include a lips-shaped couch and two massive cherries that she thrifted and fixed up to use as a piece of art in the apartment. ""I think a good way of describing my style would be intentional maximalism because I really like maximalist décor items, but not too many of them,"" she says.

One of the first things Plaisance did to the space was add floor-length curtains to create a rainbow. Jesse Freeston for CNBC Make It

Plaisance estimates she spent $28,000 in renovations. She also did a lot of the work herself, like adding crown molding to the walls — with help from her dad — and turning the bank's old entryway into her dog's bedroom. ""The first thing I did when I moved in the house is to put rainbow curtains all through the space,"" she says. ""And the fun thing with my curtains is when you close them it makes one giant rainbow."" After adding rainbow curtains to the space, one of the first things Plaisance DIYed, with help from her dad, was a studio space in the living area where she films content.

Plaisance converted the entryway of the old bank into her dog's bedroom. Marianne Plaisance

Plaisance says she spent a whole year decorating the primary bedroom: ""It's very Wes Anderson, a bit like space-aged mixed with Parisian Castle."" The couple converted one of the other bedrooms into Plaisance's office. ""I filled the room with artwork that I like that inspired me,"" she says.

Renovating and decorating the primary bedroom took about a year. Marianne Plaisance

There is a second bathroom and a third bedroom in the basement, which Plaisance's boyfriend uses as his office. The basement also has a passageway to a shared area of the building, where Plaisance has her workshop. ""It looks like a hardware store, which I love,"" she says.

The couple has been living in the former bank for over two years now, and Plaisance says they have no plans of leaving. ""I really want to take my time to transform the place because I know I want to live here for a long time,"" she says. ""It's a work in progress."" The next step is renovating the kitchen, which Plaisance plans on getting professional help for. In the next five years, she says she would like to do the bathrooms.

They also have high levels of a specific personality trait: conscientiousness.

Of the big five personality traits — openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism — conscientiousness, or how organized and disciplined you are, is the most related to longevity, David Watson, a former professor of personality psychology at the University of Notre Dame, told CNBC Make It.

This is likely because people with high degrees of conscientiousness are better at taking care of themselves. They tend to drink alcohol in moderation and eat more balanced meals, he says.

The Trump administration is broadening its anti-DEI campaign to European companies.

Government officials have reportedly sent letters to companies in France and the European Union that hold U.S. government contracts, warning them to comply with an executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs if they want to keep their contracts.

According to the document, ""Department of State contractors must certify that they do not operate any programs promoting DEI that violate any applicable anti-discrimination laws and agree that such certification is material for purposes of the government's payment decision and therefore subject to the False Claims Act.""

The letters, distributed by the American embassies in Paris and across the E.U. also included a questionnaire ordering the companies to certify their compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws. The existence of the letter was first reported Friday by the French business daily Les Echos.

U.S. diplomats in eastern E.U. states and Belgium also sent out the letter, the Financial Times reported.

Aviation and defense groups, consulting providers and infrastructure companies are among the French companies potentially exposed to the administration's demands.

The move comes around the same time the U.S. Federal Communications Commission has alerted Walt Disney and its ABC unit that it will begin an investigation into the DEI efforts at the media giant.

The French finance ministry expressed concerns about the approach by the U.S. government, saying its values don't reflect that of France.

What to know about the '10-year rule'

Before the Secure Act of 2019, heirs could empty inherited IRAs over their lifetime to reduce yearly taxes, known as the ""stretch IRA."" But since 2020, certain heirs must follow the ""10-year rule,"" and IRAs must be depleted by the 10th year after the original account owner's death. This applies to beneficiaries who are not a spouse, minor child, disabled, chronically ill or certain trusts. Many heirs still don't know how the 10-year rule works, and that can cost them, Appleby said. If you don't drain the balance within 10 years, there's a 25% IRS penalty on the amount you should have withdrawn, which could be reduced or eliminated if you fix the issue within two years.

Inherited IRAs are a 'ticking tax bomb'

For pre-tax inherited IRAs, one big mistake could be waiting until the 10th year to withdraw most of the balance, said certified financial planner Trevor Ausen, founder of Authentic Life Financial Planning in Minneapolis. ""For most, it's a ticking tax bomb,"" and the extra income in a single year could push you into a ""much higher tax bracket,"" he said.

Similarly, some heirs cash out an inherited IRA soon after receiving it without weighing the tax consequences, according to IRA expert and certified public accountant Ed Slott. This move could also bump you into a higher tax bracket, depending on the size of your IRA. ""It's like a smash and grab,"" he said. Rather than depleting the IRA in one year, advisors typically run multi-year tax projections to help heirs decide when to strategically take funds from the inherited account. Generally, it's better to spread out withdrawals over 10 years or take funds if there's a period when your income is lower, depending on tax brackets, experts say.

Many heirs must take RMDs in 2025

Starting in 2025, most non-spouse heirs must take required minimum distributions, or RMDs, while emptying inherited IRAs over 10 years, if the original account owner reached RMD age before death, according to final regulations released in July. That could surprise some beneficiaries since the IRS previously waived penalties for missed RMDs from inherited IRAs, experts say. While your custodian calculates your RMD, there are instances where it could be inaccurate, Appleby explained.

That might be true if you're struggling to pay rent — but as long as you have enough money to live comfortably, you're more likely to feel happier if you can prioritize small daily health-conscious habits, like rest and social connection, Santos said during a live taping of interview series ""Last Meal with Tom Nash"" at SXSW on March 12.

If you forgo sleep, exercise or time with loved ones to reach your financial or professional goals, you're gambling with your own happiness, said Santos, a Yale University psychology professor. You'll become happy faster, maintain your positive feelings for longer and get more overall ""bang for your happiness buck"" by prioritizing those core parts of your life, she added.

""Material possessions, fame, professional accolades at work ... We think those are going to be the stuff that moves the needle,"" Santos said. ""[But] we're often pursuing that stuff at opportunity cost of the stuff that really matters.""

Goals related to your social, emotional and physical health are better for your well-being than anything that relies on other people's approval, found a 2022 meta-analysis published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.

Here are three easy habits scientifically proven to make you feel happier, according to Santos:

Gratitude journals

Writing down things you're grateful for — whether it's having a roof over your head, a reliable relationship or a hobby you find rewarding — can improve your happiness levels and even your physical health, studies show.

The longer you keep a gratitude journal, the more of a difference you'll notice over time, Santos said in a free online course called ""The Science of Well-Being for Teens,"" which published in 2023.

Practicing gratitude for 15 minutes per day, five days per week, for six weeks can improve your mental wellness, found 2020 research by psychologists from the University of Twente and Eastern Washington University. The habit can also reduce stress, increase mental clarity and improve relationships, sleep, and mental health, other studies show.

Different strategies work for different people, other experts note. If journaling isn't your thing, you can experience similar benefits from other forms of gratitude, like writing thank you cards, observing small acts of kindness from strangers or reflecting on when someone has shown kindness to you.

Sleep more—even just 20 extra minutes per night

Getting at least seven hours of sleep per night improves your brain performance, mood and health, and reduces your likelihood of heart disease and dementia, studies show.

""I actually think we could solve most of the mental health in college age students and high school students if we just forced [them] to get more sleep,"" Santos said in the online course.

To improve your quality of sleep, she recommended relying on an alarm clock, so you leave your phone in another room while you rest. ""I know there's stuff to do ... but if you can just get the right amount of shut eye, you really will improve your mental health much more than you expect,"" said Santos.

Your physical health could benefit, too: Getting enough sleep is the No. 1 most important way to keep your body healthy over time, longevity expert Poonam Desai told CNBC Make It on Friday.

""It's something we do every single day. It's free. You have an opportunity to optimize it every single day,"" said Desai.

Talk to acquaintances, friends and family in real time

Social media and text messaging can help you quickly connect with friends and family near and far — but it doesn't give you the same mental boost as talking with someone in real time or, best-case scenario, face-to-face, Santos told the ""Huberman Lab"" podcast in December 2024.

""The two things that predict whether or not you're happy ... is how much time you spend with friends and family members, and how much time you're just physically around other people,"" Santos said.

Even briefly interacting with your local barista on weekly trips to the coffee shop can improve your happiness levels, whether you're introverted or extroverted, she added. [add links from studies]

""It gives you a sense that your life is going better,"" Santos said. ""You feel less lonely. [Being social] has all these positive outcomes that we don't expect.""

But again and again, I've seen people make bad choices. I'm a decision coach who offers one service: a single session in which I help someone make a big (or small) decision. I've worked with over 500 clients, helping them decide whether to switch careers, take job offers, get married, get divorced, have kids, start a business, get a tattoo removed, and more. In each session, I listen to a client describe their dilemma to me before we break down all their options and choose the best path forward. Over the years, I've noticed one mistake in particular that is almost guaranteed to fill them with regret.

The No. 1 mistake that leads to huge regret

People take promotions even though they know that they're bad at managing people. They move to Los Angeles even though they hate driving. They go to medical school even though the thought of more years of studying makes them miserable. They will never be happy with the outcomes, because they're making these decisions for the person they wish they were, not the person they actually are. So many of us fail at New Year's resolutions for the same reason. We're making decisions with our aspirational selves in mind. Then, when Jan. 1 comes and goes and we realize we're still our old selves, we fail to fulfill our resolutions and feel terrible. Repeat annually. DON'T MISS: How to start a side hustle to earn extra money This isn't to say people can't change. Of course they can. But that kind of change — becoming a morning person, for example, or a person who will happily quit their job to be a more present parent — takes a long time. And when you need to make a decision now, it's best to make it based on the person you are at this moment.

Pay attention to red flag phrases

How can you if tell you're making a decision for your aspirational self rather than your actual self? I've compiled a list over the years of what I call red flag phrases — language that signals someone is trying to make a decision that's not in line with who they are: ""I should…""

""Well, I could…""

""Maybe if I…""

""I could try to…""

""If I can just…"" For example, you tell yourself: ""If I can just start going to bed earlier, I'll be able to get up at 6 a.m. and write for an hour before the day starts."" Maybe, but when was the last time you consistently went to bed early? That may seem like a relatively minor example, but the same thing happens with bigger decisions, like the car-hater who moves to LA, the student who's miserable studying but applies to medical school anyway, or the career-driven parent who leaves their job. Those red flag phrases are often a sign that you're trying to talk yourself into becoming a different kind of person. If you're trying to make a decision that involves a personality change, I'd suggest not doing that.

Take a glance at Nicole Brewer's finances, and you might not be eager to trade salaries. The 43-year-old Detroit native makes about $40,000 a year teaching English at a university in Nizwa, an ancient city in Oman. Add in side hustle income as a freelance writer and travel agent, and the total for 2024 climbs to $44,000. But delve deeper into the way she lives, and you might start to envy her. Brewer pays just $650 a month for a furnished two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment that's just a five-minute walk from her job. Utilities are included. Like the students at her university, she gets winter and summer breaks. And thanks to her low cost of living, Brewer generally spends them traveling, including vacations in Namibia, Seychelles and most recently, Bali. Brewer has lived and taught abroad since 2009 — a move she made when jobs became scarce back home during the global financial crisis. Her advice for those who are considering following in her footsteps: ""Follow your heart, follow your passion and definitely do your research.""

Ignore the outside voices

The decision to move abroad is a big one, and Brewer acknowledges that living as an expat isn't always easy. ""It's definitely not without its challenges. I will say it's not an easy life to be on the other side of the world from your family, especially when emergencies and family situations come up,"" she says. ""You have to take the good with the bad."" She wasn't immune to culture shock either — especially when she moved to a Middle Eastern country as a non-Muslim and non-Arabic speaker. But none of that kept her from pursuing the life that she wanted. ""If someone wanted to live the expat life, I would definitely say to not let fear or outside voices deter you from your dream,"" Brewer says. ""If I would have listened to people about moving to the Middle East — people were like, 'Oh, it's so dangerous.' And here I am, living my best life in Oman, one of the safest countries in the world.""

https://cnbc.com,Why it's so hard to fix the U.S. air traffic control problems,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/29/why-its-so-hard-to-fix-the-us-air-traffic-control-problems.html,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","The U.S. has had a shortage of air traffic controllers for years.

Air traffic controller staffing ""is at an all-time low,"" said Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, their union.

In an interview with CNBC, Daniels said the situation has ""hit a critical point.

""We currently have 10,800 certified professional controllers where we need [to have] 14,633. Any hiccup, a government shutdown or anything that disrupts the pipeline of the air traffic controllers coming in, will absolutely hurt the capacity of the flying public, and how many planes we can put in the air at any given time safely,"" he added.

While the shortage is not new, and staffing has been hovering around similar levels for the past decade, recent events like the fatal collision of an American Airlines regional jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter in Washington, D.C. — despite it not necessarily coming as a result of errors by air traffic control — are calling more attention to the importance of filling these jobs.

The Federal Aviation Administration has limited flights in congested areas like New York because the number of controllers is insufficient.

United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has repeatedly said the staffing shortfalls are causing numerous air travel delays.

""On blue sky days last year, so days with no weather in the system, 68% of our delays were because of air traffic control restrictions"" Kirby said at the CERAWeek energy conference earlier this month. ""We have a delay in New York every single day, no matter what the weather is, because they're simply understaffed.""

In 2023, the FAA announced the Enhanced Air Traffic Collegiate Training Initiative, which allows qualified schools to provide equivalent training. The air traffic program at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University's Daytona Beach, Florida, campus was just certified in 2024 and is the fourth school in the program.

Additionally, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced that trainees at the FAA's main air traffic controller academy in Oklahoma would receive $5 more an hour to help with recruitment.

The aging computers and other systems used by the FAA are also concerning.

""We have computers — and I kid you not — today in 2025 that are based on Windows 95 and floppy disks"" Daniels said.

After an outage of a key pilot-notification system in 2023 grounded thousands of flights, the U.S. Government Accountability Office determined that 51 of 138 FAA systems that provide things like communications are unsustainable and need to be modernized.

https://cnbc.com,This old-school filmmaking technique is still kicking even as AI takes on a bigger role in movies,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/29/foley-artists-movies-hollywood.html,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Foley artist Gary Hecker recreates sounds (in this case, galloping horses) on the Foley sound stage at Todd-AO Studios in Santa Monica, California, July 3, 2012. Don Kelsen | Los Angeles Times | Getty Images

In a small studio tucked within the Sony Pictures lot, Gary Hecker makes art with sound. His canvases are some of Hollywood's biggest blockbusters — from Zack Snyder's ""Justice League"" and Quentin Tarantino's ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"" to Disney and Marvel's Spider-Man flicks and the Academy Award-winning ""Master and Commander."" Hecker is a Foley artist, the maestro tasked with crafting the everyday sound effects that occur in a scene: squeaky doors, swishing cloaks, the slap of leather reins and even the ""thwip"" of Spider-Man's webbing. ""Foley is a key element in this magic trick we do of convincing the audience to believe in the movie they're watching,"" said Rodger Pardee, professor at Loyola Marymount University. ""Foley is not for explosions or jet engines. It's for the footsteps of someone running through a forest or rock climbing, or the swish of a superhero's cape, that kind of thing. Foley gives you the details. It's the sound texture that anchors the sound mix."" As Hollywood is grappling with the rampant growth of artificial intelligence capabilities — and how, or whether, they should be used — Foley artists remain a stalwart and deeply human part of the moviemaking process. The performative nature of the craft makes it difficult for studios to use AI to match the artists' skill. However, there are few people who work full time as Foley artists, and there is currently no collegiate program for Foley. Those who wish to break into the field have to get apprenticeships with already established industry veterans.

The art of making noise

Created by Jack Foley in the late 1920s, the sound technique that became his namesake emerged in Hollywood when the industry transitioned from silent films to ""talkies."" Early recording equipment couldn't capture dialogue and ambient noise, so sounds had to be added after the film was shot. Foley discovered that performing the sound effects live and in sync with the finished product created a more authentic soundscape and helped keep audiences immersed in the film. Artists today still use many of the same techniques that were employed nearly 100 years ago. ""We do the film from top to bottom,"" Hecker said. ""Anything that's moving on that screen, we provide a sound for it."" More than 50 pairs of shoes are aligned on shelves in Hecker's studio. Some are sturdy and produce thick thuds, while others create the sharp, click-clack of high heels. There's even a set of spurs crafted by a blacksmith in the 1800s that Hecker used in Tarantino's ""Django Unchained."" ""The true art of Foley is to master the sound,"" Hecker said. ""I'm a 200-pound guy, so if I'm doing Arnold Schwarzenegger, I've got to dig deep, but if I'm doing a little geisha girl from 'Memoirs of a Geisha,' a 90-pound girl in those little wooden shoes, I have to match that performance."" His sound lab has a makeshift kitchen area teeming with cups, bottles, bowls, cloches and spray bottles of varying sizes and materials. Bins of rakes, shovels and mops galore stand next to a pile of rocks, and in the corner is a well-worn battleship howitzer shell. He's even got a stash of swords, guns, shields, armor and chains, as well as a specially built metal tower to create unique, rich metallic sounds. The floor has a collection of Foley pits — areas of wood, concrete, stone, gravel — the doors feature an assortment of handles, locks and chains, the closets are filled with a collection of jackets so Hecker can find just the right zipper sound, and, of course, there are some coconut shells. Hecker's collection of props is more than 45 years in the making. He got his start apprenticing on ""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back"" and has more than 400 film titles under his belt, including ""The Running Man,"" ""Three Amigos,"" ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure,"" ""Home Alone"" and ""300.""

Hecker's partner in sound is Jeff Gross, a mixer who transforms the crashes, clatters and clops captured in the microphone into a resonant symphony. Hecker and Gross' partnership started in the middle of the Covid pandemic while they worked on the sound effects for the video game ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III."" Since then, they've worked on both ""Rebel Moon"" films, ""Venom: The Last Dance,"" and ""Mufasa: The Lion King,"" among other projects. Last year, the pair were nominated for a Golden Reel, one of the most prized accolades in the sound editing world, for ""Mufasa: The Lion King"" and won for their work on ""Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver.""

'Anything to get a sound'

Hecker and Gross tackle one film at a time and typically spend 18 to 20 days per project, depending on the film's sound budget. Bigger-budgeted movies get more time, while smaller or independent features often get much less. While the tag team of Hecker and Gross operate out of the Sony lot, they work with all of Hollywood's major studios. These companies provide six to eight reels that contain around 15 minutes of the film each. Hecker and Gross then go reel by reel, adding all the footsteps, prop sounds and ambient sounds. The footsteps come first. Hecker stomps, trots and sidesteps in pace with each actor's performance, often accompanied by a smattering of coffee grounds to add grit to the sound of the shoes, creating the illusion of walking outside. Then he begins layering in the prop sounds. To create the metallic scrape of a sewer cover against a paved street, for example, Hecker grates the howitzer shell against a concrete slab. Gross then adds resonance to the captured sound via computer to give it a more realistic quality. Hecker has even developed techniques to recreate the sound of explosions, pushing the limits of what sound artists can provide studio movie projects.

Gross, who sits in a sound booth while Hecker works the microphone, often can't see what his partner is using to mimic what's on screen. ""You have to just get in your head and go, 'Yeah, that sounds like it,'"" he said. ""And then I'll stand up and look down onto the stage and I'm like, 'Are you using a shopping cart and a toothbrush?'"" And Hecker's skills aren't just in the physical performance. For decades, he's lent his voice to Hollywood's gorillas, aliens, dragons, monsters, horses and even lions. He's snorted, chortled and grunted to bring to life the dragon from ""Shrek,"" the aliens from ""Independence Day,"" zombies in ""Dawn of the Dead,"" the giant gorilla in ""Mighty Joe Young,"" and, most recently, a pride of lions from ""Mufasa: The Lion King.""

""It just was really cool to do all the breathing and the purrs and the efforts,"" Hecker said of working on ""Mufasa: The Lion King."" ""The actors do the voices of the character and tell the story, but these lions are moving around throughout the whole movie, and there's nothing there. So, it all had to be custom crafted and performed. So I would do that, and then Jeff would help me with making it sound like a giant beefy lion.""

A human touch

Hollywood is at a crossroads. New AI technology offers studios a chance to cut ballooning production budgets, but copyright law and a desire to keep human art in films has led to tensions. The 2023 dual writers and actors strikes were partially extended because of fraught negotiations with studios over rights, payment and use cases for AI in filmmaking and television. Those conversations were reignited in the wake of ""The Brutalist"" earning a best actor win for Adrian Brody even as his performance was altered using AI voice-generating technology — and amid fears that President Donald Trump's White House could roll back copyright protections at the behest of AI companies.

As a tough first quarter skids to a close, a crucial market debate is whether the recent mass outbreak of gloom is an overreaction to ambiguous economic and market signals, or simply a clear-eyed recognition that real-world conditions are souring fast. For anyone who has been around markets long enough, it's tempting to view the societal foul mood evident in surveys as overdone relative to the damage done so far to stock prices or the real economy. Evercore ISI strategist Julian Emanuel points out that the Conference Board's polls of both consumers and CEOs are ""nearing pandemic levels of pessimism."" The most widely tracked weekly survey of individual investors, by AAII, has logged more than 50% bears for five straight weeks, something only ever seen near the depths of raging market routs. All this, with unemployment at a slim 4.1%, the S & P 500 a mere 9% off an all-time peak and corporate profits still growing. .SPX 1M mountain S & P 500 in past month To Emanuel, the apparent mismatch between feelings and his view of fundamentals suggests it remains a ""buyable correction in an ongoing bull market."" A defensible position, for sure, though the market's underwhelming response to what seemed a pretty good rebound-rally setup since the mid-March 10%-correction low hasn't helped that case much. To recap: The S & P 500 underwent one of the sharper 10% gut checks in memory over three weeks into March 13, before pivoting higher with two days of broad, encouraging buying, followed by another decent pop last Monday on hopes of a more moderate tariff campaign. Since then, it's been a lot of messy churning in a headline-sensitive, irresolute tape. No more than 40% of the total pullback was ever recovered, before last week's late sell-off on stiff auto tariffs and disappointing consumer-spending and inflation readings. The extremity of the negative attitudes right now has Wall Street acutely sensitive to any evidence that such ""soft"" survey results are bleeding into the measured ""hard"" data tracking real activity. This helps explain the markets' severe response to Friday's modestly weaker-than-forecast personal-spending numbers for February, joined with another sticky-high core PCE inflation print. Treasury yields rushed lower to effectively price in a higher chance of broader economic weakness – which the Federal Reserve might or might not feel empowered to offset with a timely rate cut due to those uncooperative inflation numbers. Given all this, I'm glad I mentioned here last week that market bottoms are a process not a moment, that 40% of 10% corrections deepen to at least 15% even outside of recessions and initial correction lows frequently need to be retested over a number of weeks. In this context, the index retracing most of its snapback bounce is fairly typical. Of course, it's called a ""retest"" because sometimes they fail. Frank Cappelleri of CappThesis on Friday asked a kaon-like question: ""Was the back half of March a failure to go up … or a failure to go down? In other words — which side has been more frustrated by the lack of net movement?"" There's plenty of frustration to go around, it would seem, and one could argue that given the unsettling news flow, chopping sideways for two weeks might not be so bad. As the correction hit 10%, bulls saw an oversold market, solid corporate-credit conditions, widespread pessimism and a helpful washout in overextended momentum stocks — along with seasonal factors that were supposed to turn positive in mid-March. The bears are eating just fine for now, but only if they bet against the biggest and highest-quality growth stocks, and they likely feel the market is still blithely ignoring the policy risks. BTIG technical strategist Jonathan Krinsky had been calling for a tactical rally into April starting more than two weeks ago, though on Friday said the recovery attempt had become ""hard to defend."" One issue shadowing the bull case is the way once-reliable leadership groups have faltered, surrendering the benefit of the doubt they had enjoyed for more than two years. ""Outside of precious metals,"" Krinsky said, ""it's hard to find many groups in uptrends. This lack of leadership makes it difficult to defend a bullish stance outside of small bounces."" Scarcity of outperformers The once-indomitable ""Magnificent Seven"" is down 15% year to date. Semiconductors have surrendered half of their post-ChatGPT gains. Homebuilders are back to late-2023 levels and transports have been dead money for 18 months. Financials, utilities and energy act better. Within the industrial sector, aerospace and defense looks sturdy. The S & P 500 communication-services group is still firmly in an uptrend and trying to hold above its Election Day level, thanks largely to its purely defensive telecom components. These are places to hide, or hunt, perhaps. But these clusters of relative strength are probably too small collectively to drive the broader indexes too far. Of course, one investor's scarcity of outperforming leadership sectors is another's abundance of beaten-down comeback candidates. Nearly half of all S & P 500 stocks are more than 20% off a 52-week high. One way of looking at the first quarter is as a sloppy rotation toward value and foreign stocks that's worked to reset elevated investor expectations and CEO complacency. The S & P 500 value index is off just 1% this year versus a near-9% loss for growth. When it comes to tech, however, a return to outperformance could be tough. Ned Davis Research looked at all years when the tech sector lagged the S & P 500 in the first quarter by at least four percentage points. The chart here shows the average path of relative tech performance in those years, a picture of continued struggle. On a more fundamental level, the Nasdaq 100 – of which the Magnificent Seven make up more than 40% – hasn't had much of a valuation reset when gauged by expected free cash flow. For years, one bullish take on megacap growth stocks was that, even though they had high price-to-earnings ratios, almost all the earnings were free cash flow given the high margins and ""asset-light"" business models. Yet the likes of Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms are spending so heavily on AI infrastructure that more profits are funding capex rather than falling into free cash flow. This might work out fine if all the AI capacity proves an accelerant to these companies' growth in coming years, as they clearly are betting. That's the ""if"" that markets are struggling with mightily right now, as Nvidia shares near 10 months of no net progress, the CoreWeave IPO required a stiff discount to the anticipated issue price, and Microsoft is trading at a price first reached just after Thanksgiving 2023. The staticky technical and fundamental atmospherics around Big Tech don't have much to do with the suspense over the April 2 White House deadline for a new set of ""reciprocal"" tariffs. Yet tariffs are standing in as the convenient focal point for nearly all other relevant investor worries: Perceived risks to growth and inflation, as well as wariness around erratic or capricious policymaking that is keeping businesses off balance and upending global alliances. Such a pileup of feared negatives suggests at least remaining open to ways that things might turn ""less bad."" Could the April 2 tariff deadline prove a psychological clearing event for stocks that culminates this correction phase? Might next week's jobs report reassure investors that the labor market is resilient? And has the market's setback lowered that bar enough for first-quarter earnings to act as a source of relief? All pragmatic questions in a moment of piqued and pervasive pessimism.",cnbc
https://cnbc.com,These nuclear companies are leading the race to build advanced small reactors in the U.S.,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/29/these-nuclear-companies-lead-the-race-to-build-small-reactors-in-us.html,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","The nuclear industry is racing to launch advanced small reactors by the early 2030s, aiming to meet the deep-pocketed technology sector's growing need for electricity to fuel artificial intelligence.

The world has relied largely on the same pressurized-water reactor technology for the past 70 years, but those plants have proven incredibly expensive to build in the U.S. in the 21st century.

The first new nuclear plant completed in decades, reactors 3 and 4 at Plant Vogtle in Georgia, infamously cost about $18 billion more than expected and opened seven years behind schedule. Each of those reactors can generate 1,114 megawatts of electricity, enough for more than 800,000 homes.

""Doing these new builds with that older, high pressure technology is just unaffordable,"" Chris Levesque, CEO of TerraPower, an advanced reactor company co-founded and backed by Bill Gates, told CNBC.

Despite growing interest in restarting closed reactors, such as Palisades in Michigan and Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, as a quicker and cheaper near-term solution, there remains ""a whole lot of hesitation about a brand new plant,"" Levesque said.

The advanced reactors under development promise to have smaller, lighter footprints that could make them cheaper and quicker to build when they are fully commercialized. But the industry is crowded with more than 90 different technologies in various stages of development around the world, according to the Nuclear Energy Agency.

The utility and tech sectors need to winnow down the field to five or 10 companies with the right technology, said John Ketchum, CEO of NextEra Energy , the largest power company by market capitalization in the U.S.

""A lot of them are under capitalized,"" Ketchum said of the small nuclear startups designing advanced reactors. ""So we've got to pick out the ones that we really want to get behind and make the bets,"" the CEO said at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston earlier this month.

Ketchum sees the first advanced reactor coming online around 2031 in the U.S., with more units potentially on the way around 2035. Technology companies will serve as a catalyst, with Levesque saying they are a ""huge force"" that can drive the industry forward due to their immense demand for electricity coupled with their deep pockets. Alphabet , Amazon , Meta and Microsoft together are worth seven times the value of the entire S&P 500 utility sector.

The following are some of the leading players in the U.S. market to revive nuclear power, all three of them private but with significant financial backing — often from tech companies — and customers already lined up.

TerraPower

TerraPower is the first advanced reactor company in the U.S. to move from design to construction, breaking ground on its first plant near a former coal site in Kemmerer, Wyoming in the summer of 2024. The company aims to start dispatching power by the end of 2030 to Warren Buffett's PacifiCorp.

TerraPower's Natrium reactor operates at atmospheric temperature, a feature that Levesque says will reduce construction costs.

The U.S. currently relies on reactors that operate at about 300 Celsius (572 degrees Fahrenheit) and are cooled by water. The system operates under high pressure — water boils at 100 degree Celsius — to keep the coolant liquid, and the plants need heavy, expensive components to contain the pressure, Levesque said.

TerraPower uses sodium, rather than water, as a coolant. Liquid sodium boils at 900 Celsius, much higher than the Natrium reactor's operating temperature of around 500 Celsius. That means the plant does not need to be pressurized, Levesque said.",cnbc
