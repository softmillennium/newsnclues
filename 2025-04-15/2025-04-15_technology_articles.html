                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shortly after reports of the site being down started circulating, a user on a rival image board, soyjack.party, claimed credit for the hack. Through their alleged access, the hacker apparently reopened /qa/, a board that had been shut down for being a unique brand of awful, as well as exposed personal information of 4chan staff and leaked code from the image board. “Tonight has been a very special night for many of us at the soyjak party. Through the thread about the hack on Soyjack Party, users shared screenshots that purport to show admin access on 4chan, conversations that took place on private message boards that were only available to moderators, and internal tools that moderators had access to that show the location, host, and IP address of 4chan users. The Daily Dot reported that it was able to access a list of supposed contact information of 218 4chan moderators, managers, and janitors. Though Gizmodo has seen the list that's circulating online, there's no way to verify its authenticity. Soyjack posters also claimed that there was a “flood of refugees” from 4chan joining Soyjack Party after the hack, but they are “not adjusting well to the culture.” The /qa/ board was banned by 4chan, in part because it was a board that became a battleground for different factions that used the site. Soyjack Party users seem to have a history of raiding 4chan-related forums, as Reddit users in the 4chan ecosystem have noted Soyjack Party users flooding different subreddits and forcing them to go private. 4chan mods, understandably, seem a bit worried about their information getting leaked. Over on a Discord server where parts of the 4chan staff allegedly chat, there are a lot of concerns about the alleged hack and users encouraging each other to take precautions to secure their accounts. Hyperfixed host and longtime tech journalist Alex Goldman pointed out that there is seemingly unconfirmed buzz that some mod emails had .gov domains, which fits into the narrative that 4chan is a honeypot for federal law enforcement—a meme that is popular among Soyjack users. For what it's worth, there are lots of people claiming that moderators and janitors have .gov emails, or claiming that most of their IP addresses are in the Washington, D.C. area, but very little that would amount to proof of that. People are happily posting screenshots of the hack, but when it comes to the claims that there are government agents on the site, for whatever reason, no one seems interested in posting evidence. In fact, there are multiple people who claim to have actually parsed through the leaked data and did not find any .gov emails. Also, why would feds trying to operate a secret honeypot use their real email addresses?

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. After around six months since the first sighting, Microsoft is finally addressing an issue in Outlook (Classic), which led to increased CPU usage, visible slowdowns, and even freezes whenever you'd sit down to compose an email or type a message. The developer team was able to reproduce this bug on updating to Microsoft 365 Apps Version 2406 Build 17726.20126+, which was released in June 2024, on the Current, Monthly Enterprise, and Insider Channels. As of writing, a concrete solution is not available, so users have been recommended to move to the Semi-Annual Channel release, where this issue has not been observed. If you're running an organization with several devices, Microsoft offers a detailed guide for migrating your update channel with options like Group Policies, the Office Deployment Tool, Microsoft Configuration Manager, and Intune, just to name a few. Affected users went through several troubleshooting hoops, like turning off graphics acceleration, disabling the spell-check utility, along with add-ins, but to no avail. It got so bad that a user with a beefy i9-14900HX reported CPU temperatures breaching 95 degrees Celsius just by having the 'New Message' window open, which is used to compose emails.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>None of this should be surprising, but to belabor the point: DOGE has everything. It is well past time to stop nickel-and-diming the story. There is a new lengthy investigation out from NPR today detailing how Elon Musk's waste and government efficiency initiative has barreled into the National Labor Relations Department and exfiltrated mass amounts of sensitive data, taking great lengths to cover its tracks, and threatening employees who speak out. Experts in cybersecurity likened the actions taken to those of a state-sponsored hacking group, questioning why a mandate to save money in government would require such cloak-and-dagger behavior—DOGE staffers demanded activity logging be disabled, and wiped their anonymous user accounts on the way out. His concerns triggered a formal investigation of what appeared to be a serious, ongoing breach or potentially illegal removal of sensitive data: In the days after Berulis and his colleagues prepared a request for CISA's help investigating the breach, Berulis found a printed letter in an envelope taped to his door, which included threatening language, sensitive personal information and overhead pictures of him walking his dog, according to the cover letter attached to his official disclosure. After DOGE left the building, Berulis began looking around to piece together what they had done and found very little. But “logs that were used to monitor outbound traffic from the system were absent” and “some actions taken on the network, including data exfiltration, had no attribution — except to a ‘deleted account'.” It was discovered through NPR's investigation that a DOGE engineer, Jordan Wick, had a repository on his GitHub called “NxGenBdoorExtract,” whose name suggests it could be a backdoor system to extract files from NxGen, the NLRB's internal case management system. One of DOGE's other workers, who goes by the name “Big Balls,” has previously worked for a cyberhacking group, providing cloud hosting services to a gang that trafficked in stolen data. What is more, unknown users had granted themselves high-level keys to access NLRB storage, and there was no way to access what they did with the permission. Controls were disabled that would prevent unauthorized devices, like smartphones, from logging onto the system without permission, and two-factor authentication was also turned off. Musk has said that would recuse himself of any work involving his companies. “You know, it's not like I'll be getting away [with] something in the dead of night.” But Musk has also used data obtained from agencies including the Social Security Administration to spread unfounded claims of fraud, and relentlessly attacked the former Biden administration in retaliation over Tesla not being invited to a White House EV summit. It has been speculated that Musk may have an interest in learning about investigations into Tesla or X—or using data to train models for xAI. The more concerning potential is for Musk, who has for years been hell-bent on dismantling unions, could exploit newfound access to information on testimony, union leaders, and legal strategies. Maybe he will not use it, but the point is that there is no good reason for DOGE to be covertly exfiltrating data from the department with little to no accountability. And Musk famously rifled through Twitter's internal communications following his purchase of the company, firing anyone who spoke negatively about him. It is not unheard of that he might be tempted to snuff out Tesla or SpaceX whistleblowers and fire them under false pretenses. DOGE gaining access to sensitive information alone may be the point: Go to the authorities with your concerns and we will find you. In unrelated news, Katy Perry and Jeff Bezos' financé Lauren Sanchez went up to space on a Blue Origin rocket this week—a stunt that was looked at with some disdain as the rest of the world back down on Earth crumbles.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI is building its own X-like social media network, according to a new report from The Verge. The project is still in the early stages, but there's an internal prototype focused on ChatGPT's image generation that contains a social feed. With this new social network, OpenAI would be taking on Elon Musk's X and Meta's social platforms, Facebook and Instagram. The new app would also allow OpenAI to access real-time data to train its AI models, something that both X and Meta already have. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has reportedly been privately asking outsiders for feedback about the social network. At this point, it's not clear whether the project will ever launch publicly, but the existence of a prototype shows that OpenAI is looking to expand beyond its current offerings.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg once considered deleting everyone's Facebook friends in an effort to boost the social network's cultural relevance. The idea was that forcing everyone to re-create their friend graphs could encourage users to reconnect with the social network as they rebuild their social connections. However, the evidence presented in the trial revealed that Zuckerberg had considered other strategies to maintain his company's relevance, including shifting Facebook from a friends-based model to a follower-based model. In recent weeks, Facebook has focused again on connecting friends, having revamped its Friends tab in an effort to return to an “OG Facebook.” The new tab centralizes friend requests and only friends' content, including their posts, reels, stories, and birthdays. “I think there are a lot of opportunities to make [Facebook] way more culturally influential than it is today,” Zuckberg told investors during Meta's Q4 2024 earnings call about his key goals for the year ahead.

Look, I am not a fan of DOGE. But on this one small point, your argument doesn't work. I thought the purported benefit of having skilled programmers/coders running DOGE would be that at least whatever they did would be done in a...programmatic way?

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A new Linux kernel patch brings hardware enablement for Intel's Bartlett Lake-S family of processors. This update enables the kernel to properly identify these processors at boot, assigning them a CPUID for recognition in software. At CES, Intel formally introduced the Bartlett Lake-S platform, which includes three CPUs configured with hybrid cores intended for NEX (Network and Edge) applications. Since last year, rumors have alleged the existence of a performance-core-only analog, wielding up to 12P cores and 24 threads. Bartlett Lake targets the LGA 1700 platform, so these CPUs should be drop-in replacements for existing 600-series and 700-series motherboards, after updating the BIOS, of course. The engineer additionally noted, "Bartlett Lake has a P-core only product with Raptor Cove", which effectively corroborates all previous leaks. Pertinently, Bartlett Lake-S (P-core only) is reported to utilize a new die, as all Raptor Lake silicon is limited to just eight performance cores. The same leaker suggests these processors will debut in 125W/65W/45W configurations, catering to a wide variety of customers. Existing Bartlett Lake options are limited to embedded packages like COM-HPCs. Monolithic core configurations can clear up scheduling headaches and open a door for Intel to re-enable AVX-512 instruction support, which has been fused off silicon since later Alder Lake batches. This might be a compromise gamers are willing to make, though, whether these chips can hold their own against AMD's Ryzen 9000 series remains to be seen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“I call it beautiful, clean coal—I tell my people to never use the word ‘coal' unless you put ‘beautiful, clean' before it,” the president recently said during a press event involving a backdrop of men dressed in coal miner outfits. The new government continues to attack and dismantle worker protections that provide health and economic benefits to a whole array of workers, including those who toil in subterranean mines. Now, two unions representing miners have sued the White House over its recent threat to their welfare. In These Times writes that the United Miner Workers of America (UMWA) and the AFL-CIO's United Steelworkers have filed litigation against the Mine Safety and Health Administration which, under Trump, has paused a long-pursued regulation that would have limited miners' exposure to a toxic chemical commonly found in mines. The rule, called “Lowering Miners' Exposure to Respirable Crystalline Silica and Improving Respiratory Protection,” would have—just as it says—enforced new regulations that drastically reduced miners' exposure to crystalline silica, which is a toxic mineral that can cause serious respiratory problems when inhaled. The rule would have cut the allowable exposure level of deadly silica dust—20 times more toxic than coal dust and a major cause of black lung disease among coal miners — in half. The rule was planned to take effect on April 14 after decades of lobbying from coal miners, public health experts and worker advocates. When it was published in 2024, the Department of Labor estimated the new rule would result in more than 1,000 fewer deaths and 3,746 fewer cases of silica-related illnesses. In These Times also notes that, under the rubric of Elon Musk's DOGE, the government has sought to downsize and reorganize several worker protection agencies that maintain health and safety standards for coal miners. Those agencies include the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), both of which are responsible for establishing safety rules for America's workforce. Trump and his political movement have long engaged in a political strategy that involves flattering and paying lip service to certain kinds of workers while simultaneously passing laws and policies that threaten to harm (economically or otherwise) those very same workers.

In the wake of criticism over the underwhelming performance of its AI products, especially in areas like notification summaries, Apple on Monday detailed how it is trying to improve its AI models by analyzing user data privately with the aid of synthetic data.

Using an approach called “differential privacy,” the company said it would first generate synthetic data and then poll users' devices (provided they've opted-in to share device analytics with Apple) with snippets of the generated synthetic data to compare how accurate its models are, and subsequently improve them.

“Synthetic data are created to mimic the format and important properties of user data, but do not contain any actual user generated content,” the company wrote in the blog post. “To curate a representative set of synthetic emails, we start by creating a large set of synthetic messages on a variety of topics […] We then derive a representation, called an embedding, of each synthetic message that captures some of the key dimensions of the message like language, topic, and length.”

The company said these embeddings are then sent to a small number of user devices that have opted in to Device Analytics, and the devices then compare them with a sample of emails to tell Apple which embeddings are most accurate. 

The company said it is using this approach to improve its Genmoji models, and would in the future use synthetic data for Image Playground, Image Wand, Memories Creation, and Writing Tools, as well as Visual Intelligence. Apple said it would also poll users who opt in to share device analytics with synthetic data to improve email summaries.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tech companies aren't holding back when it comes to stuffing artificial intelligence capabilities into every app and piece of hardware they can, and even the most basic software tools are getting their own AI upgrades—such as the long-serving Windows utilities Paint and Notepad. Windows Paint has traditionally stuck to the basics when it comes to image creation and image editing, but if you load up the application in Windows now, you'll see a Copilot button that leads you to three AI options: Image Creator (for generating new images), Generative Erase (for erasing parts of an image), and Remove Background (for taking away the background behind the main subject in an image). Pick Generative Erase from the Copilot menu, and you can wipe objects and people out of your picture—maybe a pole that's ruining a view, for example. This simply turns everything white, besides the main subject of your image—there are no tools or settings to play around with in this case. As you would expect, it works better for images where the main subject is more obvious, but the results can be impressive—and can save you a lot of manual image editing time. Note that while Generative Erase and Remove Background can be used for free, Image Creator uses up AI credits associated with your Microsoft account. You can't buy these separately, they come as part of a subscription to Microsoft 365 or Copilot Pro subscriptions, so use them wisely. You can read more about AI credits and how they work here. Notepad is perhaps better known as a code editor than a word processor, but in recent years Microsoft has added more features in the way of formatting and auto-save. If you open it in Windows, you'll see these features as well as a Copilot button in the top-right corner of the interface. You can't use Copilot inside Notepad to generate new text, as you can in Copilot on the web or in other tools like ChatGPT. There's also Change format, which lets you put the selected text into a different structure: A list, marketing speak, or poetry, for example. You can also choose Rewrite from this menu for a more comprehensive set of options—and to see previews of the rewritten text before it's applied. A new pop-up window appears, giving you more options for changing the length, tone, and format. You also get different variations to choose between in each case. At the time of writing, it seems Notepad is giving everyone a few AI-powered rewrites for free—but as with Image Creator in Paint, you're going to need some AI credits with a Microsoft 365 or Copilot Pro subscription to use this extensively. Of course, if you'd rather not use these AI tools and don't want to see the Copilot button hanging around, you can turn it off altogether: Click the gear icon (top right), then turn off the Copilot toggle switch.

Although this does not sound like a good moniker, it is: Ramakrishnan is one of the world's most eminent scientists in the fields of structural biology and cellular processes related to aging and death. After the enormous success of The Gene Machine, a memoir in which he recounts his human and scientific journey, he published the mighty Why We Die, a book—as its name suggests—dedicated precisely to illustrating the dynamics that regulate aging and which, progressively and inexorably, lead to death. Ramakrishnan was recently in Italy, in Milan, where he gave a lecture at the second edition of the Milan Longevity Summit, the most important Italian event dedicated to longevity and psycho-physical well-being, organized by BrainCircle Italia. This interview has been edited for clarity and length. WIRED: Professor Ramakrishnan, the crucial question in your book is why we die. It is the result of the failure of a critical system or apparatus, for example, heart, brain, lung, or kidney failure. In this sense there is an apparent paradox: When our organism, as a whole, is alive, millions of cells within us are constantly dying, and we do not even realize it. On the other hand, at the time of death, most of the cells in our bodies are still alive, and entire organs are still functioning and can be donated to people in need of transplantation. Speaking of death and aging, you say in your most recent book that you “wanted to offer an objective look at our current understanding of the two phenomena.” What was the biggest surprise or most deeply held belief that you had to reconsider while writing and researching this work? Evolution does not care how long we live, but merely selects the ability to pass on our genes, a process known as “fitness” in evolutionary biology. Another curious finding was the fact that aging is not simply due to wear and tear on cells. Do you think there is an aspect of the biology of aging that is still deeply misunderstood by the general public? Although in principle there are no laws or constraints that prevent us from living much longer than we do currently, great longevity or “eternal youth” are still far off, and very significant obstacles to increasing our maximum life expectancy remain. We must also beware of the pseudoscience—and business—around the concepts of “anti-aging” or the “reversal of aging.” These are often baseless concepts, unsupported by hard evidence, even though they may use language that sounds scientific. Unfortunately, we are all afraid of growing old and dying, so we are very sensitive to any claim that promises to help us avoid it. Of course, the closer these species are to us, the better, which is why drug trials are first conducted on mice and even monkeys and chimpanzees. But we can learn a lot from organisms like the worm. For example, humans with some of the same mutations that cause the longevity of worms turn out to have serious problems, such as growth defects. What do you think are the social and ethical implications of our desire to live longer? However, our individual desires may conflict with what is best for society. A society in which fertility rates are very low and lifespans are very high will be a stagnant society, with very slow generational turnover, and probably much less dynamic and creative. The Nobel Prize-winning South American novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, who recently passed away, expressed it best: “Old age on the one hand terrifies us, but when we feel anxious, it is important to remember how terrible it would be to live forever. If eternity were guaranteed, all the incentives and illusions of life would vanish. This thought can help us live old age in a better way.” This story originally appeared on WIRED Italia and has been translated from Italian.
