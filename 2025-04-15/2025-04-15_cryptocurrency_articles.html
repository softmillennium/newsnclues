                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Wells notice informs recipients that the SEC is considering taking enforcement action against them, but now that investigation has ended without findings or enforcement. The regulator has consistently declined comment when firms have reported closed investigations in recent weeks. “After years of litigation, unjust allegations, crippling legal fees, and the biggest hurdle we could possibly encounter—we are free,” the project posted on X (formerly Twitter). We are a small, passionate, and creative Web3 team that elected to fight this battle for the betterment of Web3.” “We have taken some hard hits; but ultimately we have come through the other side—stronger and more determined than ever,” said pseudonymous CyberKongz creator and artist Myoo on X. “The next chapter involves going back to our roots and doing what Kongz does best.” In early March, Bored Ape Yacht Club creator Yuga Labs announced that its investigation by the SEC had been closed, calling it a “huge win” for NFTs. Furthermore, NFT marketplace OpenSea also had its investigation dropped by the Commission in late February. CyberKongz launched its genesis NFT collection on Ethereum in 2021. The project has since spawned multiple companion collections, including one on Ethereum gaming sidechain Ronin, where it migrated its Play & Kollect game in 2023. Once boasting sales above $300,000, the project's flagship collection now starts at a price of $5,447 worth of Ethereum, according to NFT Price Floor.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum (ETH) is down 2% on Tuesday following a 120K ETH decline in the net balance of staking protocols in the past five days. With the shadow of Trump's tariffs still hanging over the crypto market, ETH investors who have held their tokens in staking protocols are beginning to show weakness after depleting their staked holdings. In the past five days, Ethereum's total value staked dropped by over 120K ETH, worth about $192 million. A decrease in the total number of staked coins signals that investors are looking to distribute their assets. If these unstaked tokens enter the open market, it could cause further downside pressure on ETH. Since the beginning of April, ETH's supply on exchanges has increased by nearly 400K ETH, causing prices to decline briefly below $1,500 last week. A cryptocurrency's exchange supply increase indicates rising selling pressure and could result in an opposite price reaction. While the bearish sentiment remains, Ethereum whales — with a balance of 10K ETH to 100K ETH — flipped from selling to buying on Tuesday. After distributing over 570K ETH between April 2 and April 14, these whales have resumed accumulation, scooping up 320K ETH in the past 24 hours. An extended rise in whale buying could provide support for and boost prices. If the triangle's support holds, ETH could test the resistance near $1,688, which is strengthened by a key descending trendline extending from March 25. Bulls will have to defend the $1,412 key level if this support fails. Since Friday, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastic Oscillator (Stoch) have mostly been above their neutral levels. However, the recent move below their neutral levels could accelerate bearish momentum. Information on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin miner Bitdeer is reportedly expanding its self-mining operations and investing in United States-based production as looming trade wars rock global supply chains and cryptocurrency markets. Bitdeer has begun prioritizing mining Bitcoin (BTC) itself in response to cooling demand for its mining hardware from other miners, Bloomberg reported on April 15. “Our plan going forward is to prioritize our own self-mining,” Jeff LaBerge, Bitdeer's head of capital markets and strategic initiatives, reportedly said. Additionally, Bitdeer plans to scale US hardware manufacturing in the second half of the year as US President Donald Trump touts plans to penalize foreign imports and promote domestic manufacturing, Bloomberg said. “This is something we've been planning for a long time,” LaBerge said about the manufacturing plans. In April, Trump tipped plans for sweeping tariffs on US imports. The Bitcoin network is especially vulnerable to trade barriers since mining hardware involves complex global supply chains. Related: Tariffs, capital controls could fragment blockchain networks — Execs Bitcoin miners — including Bitdeer — have struggled in 2025 as volatile crypto markets worsen the impact of the Bitcoin network's April 2024 halving. In February, Bitdeer's stock dropped by roughly 28% after the Bitcoin miner announced lower-than-expected earnings and revenues for the fourth quarter of 2024. Every four years, the amount of BTC mined per “block” — a bundle of transaction data stored on the blockchain — is cut in half. Since then, mining revenues and gross profits have dropped by an average of 46% and 57%, respectively, JPMorgan said previously in a research note shared with Cointelegraph. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's hash price — a measure of miner profitability — has sunk to nearly all-time lows, according to data from the Hashrate Index.</p>

A Pennsylvania man could serve up to six years in prison after filing false tax returns that underreported millions of dollars of income he made from selling non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Waylon Wilcox earned most of his unreported money by hawking 97 CryptoPunk NFTs in 2021 and 2022, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.

The U.S. Attorney says Wilcox underreported his 2021 income by more than $8.5 million and reduced his tax burden by nearly $2.2 million. He then underreported his 2022 income by nearly $4.6 million and reduced his tax by more than $1 million. Both years, he indicated on his tax returns that he didn't receive money for digital assets, but prosecutors say that he sold 97 CryptoPunks worth $12.3 million.

Explained Yury Kruty, Philadelphia Field Office Special Agent in Charge,

“IRS Criminal Investigation is committed to unraveling complex financial schemes involving virtual currencies and non-fungible token (NFT) transactions designed to conceal taxable income. In today's economic environment, it's more important than ever that the American people feel confident that everyone is playing by the rules and paying the taxes they owe.”  

Wilcox pled guilty last week to two counts related to filing false tax returns. He will be sentenced at a later date and faces a maximum penalty of six years in prison.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leading altcoin Ethereum has seen its price climb 5% over the past week, riding the wave of a broader market recovery. This price growth has reignited demand for the altcoin, particularly among US-based ETH retail traders, as indicated by on-chain data. It has moved back above zero, signaling heightened buying activity from US investors. When its value climbs above zero, it suggests significant buying activity by US-based investors on Coinbase. Conversely, when it declines and dips into the negative territory, it signals less trading activity on the US-based exchange. ETH's Coinbase Premium Index reflects bullish sentiment in the market, as traders are willing to pay a premium to purchase the coin on Coinbase. However, institutional investors in the US remain cautious. This is evident in the ongoing outflows from US-based spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs), marking the altcoin's seventh consecutive day of withdrawals. This divergence suggests that while US retail investors are increasingly optimistic about ETH's short-term prospects, institutional players are more cautious, possibly due to macroeconomic uncertainty. ETH's Balance of Power (BoP) is positive at press time, reflecting today's market recovery. This indicator, which measures buying and selling pressures, is in an upward trend at 0.57. A positive BoP like this indicates more capital inflow into ETH than outflow, signaling an accumulation trend. If this continues, it could push the altcoin's price to $2,114. However, if market sentiment turns bearish and ETH retail traders reduce their demand for the altcoin, it could lose recent gains and drop to $1,395.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On April 14, OpenSea, one of the earliest and most widely used NFT marketplaces, made a full transition to new infrastructure by launching OS 2.0. The platform now shares a uniform smart contract basis across all chains, starting with Ethereum and in the future scaling to other networks. OpenSea ensures better load times, improved reliability, and lower gas fees with this launch. Features like premium order types, royalty optimization, and on-chain compliance aim to give creators more control and allow traders to be more functional. The SEA token will be a governance token for the OpenSea protocol, with voting rights in decision-making for protocol upgrades, incentive design, and treasury payouts. Unlike most other marketplace tokens, which tend to care primarily about fee discounts, SEA is built to influence the direction of the platform instead of just itself — bringing OpenSea in line with the decentralization ethos of Web3. The airdrop structure will benefit long-time OpenSea buyers, regular NFT traders, and early adopters. OpenSea has already launched a claims page that is live, where qualified wallets can confirm and redeem their allocations. One of the standout features of OS 2.0 is its smart contract system, which allows for quick upgrades and feature extension without the need to completely redeploy contracts. OS 2.0 also facilitates gas-optimized execution, or reduced listing and purchasing NFT fees. Traders are watching closely for eligibility and positioning themselves to be part of DAO governance. Early feedback on OS 2.0 has been uniformly positive, with users reporting smoother experiences and thanking OpenSea for the transparency shown in releasing its roadmap. However, success relies on implementation and how OpenSea builds trust across communities after years of dominance within the centralized landscape.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US considers untapped financial resources, like tariff revenues and gold revaluation, to fund Bitcoin acquisitions. Bo Hines, Executive Director of the Presidential Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, has outlined how he claims the US plans to grow its newly established Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) budget-neutrally. On Anthony Pompliano's podcast, Hines explained that the administration is exploring several budget-neutral strategies, including leveraging tariff revenue and revaluing Treasury gold certificates. Over the past weeks, President Donald Trump imposed sweeping tariffs that triggered a temporary global market downturn. According to Hines, any future tariff earnings could help support Bitcoin purchases and align with their commitment to avoid extra costs for the BTC purchases. “We're looking at many creative ways—whether it be from tariffs, whether it be from something else… Everything is on the table.” Hines pointed out that another proposal gaining traction involves updating the valuation of Treasury-held gold certificates. Currently, these certificates are priced at $43 per ounce, far below the actual market rate of over $3,000. The government official said that revising this outdated valuation could unlock capital that may be used to acquire more Bitcoin for the reserve. Hines made it clear there is no cap on how much Bitcoin the government aims to hold, contrasting to the 1 million target matched by many. “You know, I've heard a lot of different senators and folks on the Hill talk about specific numbers. The government official continued that the goal is to secure long-term economic strength through strategic accumulation, not arbitrary targets. “That's like asking how much gold you want as a country.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To wit, Fortune is now reporting that Trump is about to remove the proverbial wraps from his latest venture: a Monopoly-like crypto game where players can earn in-game cash by moving and erecting properties in a digital city. The venture is reportedly being spearheaded by Bill Zanker, a longtime Trump associate. Zanker has confirmed that he is developing a game that will launch later in April, but denied his initiative's purported similarity to MONOPOLY GO! As stated earlier, this venture would merely be the latest in a long series of commercial ventures that Trump and his family members have launched recently. Recently, Trump Media and Technology Group, where Trump holds the majority stake albeit encapsulated within a trust, partnered with Crypto.com to offer a variety of crypto-related ETFs under the Truth.Fi brand, in conjunction with Yorkville advisors. These crypto-focused ETFs are expected to launch later this year following regulatory approval, and will also be widely available internationally. In November, the Financial Times reported that Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) was in advanced talks to acquire Bakkt, a dedicated crypto exchange owned by Intercontinental Exchange. More recently, Trump Media's board approved the creation of a "strategic acquisition fund with select investors," setting off a wave of speculation in relation to the possible acquisition of Bakkt.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shares of Applied Digital (APLD), a Texas bitcoin mining and data center firm, dropped sharply on Tuesday after the digital infrastructure provider reported quarterly results that fell short of Wall Street expectations. The company, which has pivoted from its crypto mining roots to focus on high-performance computing (HPC) and AI-focused data centers, reported revenue of $52.9 million for the quarter ending February 28, 2025—a 22% increase from a year earlier, but well below analysts' consensus estimate of $64.5 million, a nearly 18% miss. Despite the top-line miss, Applied Digital reported a non-GAAP net loss of $0.08 per share, beating analysts' expectations of a $0.10 per-share loss. However, adjusted EBITDA came in at $10 million, a 41% miss compared to the expected $16.9 million, signaling continued margin pressure amid heavy infrastructure investments.APLD shares plunged as much as 30% from the Monday close, and were trading around $3.90 in the early hours of the session.A significant drag came from the company's Cloud Services unit, which posted a sharp sequential revenue decline of 36%, falling from $27.7 million in the prior quarter to $17.8 million. Applied Digital attributed the drop to a shift from single-tenant contracts to a multi-tenant, on-demand GPU model—a transition that faced initial technical challenges. Notably, the company's board of directors approved on April 10 a plan to sell the Cloud Services business entirely, aiming to refocus on its core HPC data center operations and potentially position itself as a real estate investment trust (REIT) in the future.

Bitcoin Prints Bullish Reversal Signal, But Short-Term Risks Loom Daily volume is outpacing its 30-day average, On-Balance Volume is trending higher, and RSI continues to pressure resistance—all classic ingredients for a bullish breakout. BTC also sits inside the daily TBO Cloud, signaling long-term strength. Additionally, a TBT Stop Loss Hunting alert fired yesterday, which frequently, though not always, foreshadows sudden bearish price action. These two warnings, paired with BTC's inability to pierce daily resistance and RSI's failure to break above its long-term trendline, suggest a short-term correction may be imminent. If BTC does retrace, stablecoin dominance is expected to rise back toward resistance at 8.22%, while Bitcoin dominance is likely to continue climbing. Despite lower highs forming on daily RSI for BTC.D, price strength suggests altcoins will lag. Top 10 Dominance will likely fall alongside BTC, while OTHERS.D remains in recovery mode following its recent drop. This reinforces the likelihood that altcoins will react more violently than Bitcoin during any near-term drawdown. Volatility Eases but Could Return Quickly if BTC Pulls Back BVOL7D has exited the Rejection Zone as expected, a reflection of reduced short-term volatility in response to falling RSI and declining price momentum. However, if BTC falls by 4% to 5%, volatility could spike again. This setup is reminiscent of February's pattern, when brief corrections led to quick surges in BVOL7D before resuming broader trends. XRP is back inside the TBO Cloud, but a BTC pullback would likely drag it down as well. SOL managed to close above overhead resistance and into the TBO Cloud, printing a daily TBO Close Short and reclaiming the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level. LTC needs a stronger move inside the TBO Cloud to turn sentiment. While the weekly chart offers a possible path to 0.8876, traders should be cautious with weekly RSI still heavily oversold and long-term support much lower. Bitcoin's daily chart looks strong and continues to support a longer-term move toward $94,000. The broader crypto market continues to show signs of recovery, but volatility is far from over. Take partial profits where possible and reduce risk when bearish signals appear. Securing gains along the way ensures you remain in control, regardless of market turbulence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tether, the global giant of digital assets and leading stablecoin issuer, announced a significant strategic investment in Fizen Limited, a fintech company at the forefront of self-custody crypto wallets and digital payments. Founded with the goal of simplifying the adoption of criptovalute, Fizen develops advanced solutions for digital payments, making the use of stablecoin immediate for both consumers and businesses. Through this investment, Tether will allow Fizen to strengthen its blockchain infrastructure and increase the integration of stablecoins across multiple ecosystems. This will have a concrete impact on the ability for users to store, transfer, and pay easily via stablecoin, even in the most remote corners of the world or where access to traditional banks is precluded. In this context, stablecoins represent a concrete alternative, especially in areas where barriers to access are still high. However, although they offer advantages such as reduced fees, enhanced security, and near-instant transactions, stablecoins still struggle to find a true application in daily commerce. The model proposed by Fizen allows any merchant to accept payments in stablecoin without investments in costly technological upgrades. In fact, thanks to already widespread methods like QR code and card readers, the user can pay in crypto and the merchant immediately receives fiat currency, ensuring a familiar and efficient experience. A solution that aims to revolutionize the global market of digital payments, especially in a context destined to grow exponentially. Only in 2024, it is estimated that payments via QR code will exceed 3 trillion dollars, with over 2.2 billion users by 2025. This evolution is driven not only by the spread of smartphones, but above all by the growing demand for fluid, secure, and accessible payments. It was clearly explained by Leo Vu, founder and CEO of Fizen.io, who emphasized how tools like USD₮, Tether's leading stablecoin, already have the potential to become the engine of financial inclusion. However, an additional step forward is needed on the front of ease of use, and Fizen is ready to lead this transformation: “Facilitating crypto payments through intuitive user experiences, where blockchain technologies remain invisible to the user's eyes, is our goal.” “We recognize the essential role that self-custody payment infrastructures play in creating concrete use cases for cryptocurrencies.” This philosophy reinforces not only Tether's global leadership as the most used stablecoin, but also its long-term commitment to a more equitable and globally inclusive financial system. Through a solid blockchain infrastructure, a customer-oriented vision, and the removal of access barriers for businesses and individuals, this partnership aims to accelerate the mass adoption of digital payments on a global scale. In an era marked by the transformation of financial models, this joint initiative marks a decisive step in the direction of a decentralized, secure, and truly accessible ecosystem for everyone. And it strengthens, once again, the belief that cryptocurrencies are not just an alternative, but a true evolution of traditional economic systems.</p>

A CryptoQuant analyst has suggested it might be time for investors to load up on altcoins. Other analysts have also expressed similar views, but the tide may not lift all boats. Over the past few months, the volatility of altcoins, which makes them appealing to investors with high-risk tolerance, has again proven to be a double-edged sword. Amid broader market uncertainty, most altcoins have tanked over 50% from their Q4 2024 highs. But now, one analyst suggests that a reversal may be on the horizon. Hasbro, MGM, and Skechers trust this AI marketing firm — invest pre-IPO from $0.55 per share now. DCA, short for dollar-cost averaging, is a popular investment strategy where a fixed amount of money is invested at regular intervals regardless of price action. The analyst's view is based on an intersection of moving averages on the Aggregated Altcoin Trading Volume for Stablecoin Quote Pairs chart, tracking volumes across multiple altcoin pairs. Here's what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy. “These phases can last several weeks or even months, but historically, they've consistently offered attractive opportunities to set up a DCA strategy,” the CryptoQuant analyst stressed. In an April 3 livestream, Real Vision Chief Crypto Analyst Jamie Coutts argued that altcoins still had gas for one more impulsive move in the current market cycle, eying June for the start of such a rally. But Coutts cautioned that the tide would not lift all boats, instead urging investors to look out for assets seeing a bump in network activity. It aligns with recent arguments from CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju that the dynamics of crypto altcoin season have changed. Altcoin season is a bull market phase during which altcoins record substantial price increases, significantly outperforming Bitcoin. It has historically been the result of capital rotation from Bitcoin as investors seek higher beta plays. As such, the historical sign for altcoin season has been a decline in Bitcoin dominance. But with the emergence of proxies like MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) and spot exchange-traded funds, Young Ju contended that the cord between Bitcoin and altcoins has been broken. Further, he argued that the metric to watch was no longer Bitcoin dominance but trading volumes, theorizing that coins that will make it will be the ones with paper wrappers like ETFs or ecosystems based on stablecoins or Bitcoin. Nonetheless, any potential altcoin rally will likely depend on an improvement in the current macroeconomic conditions, as uncertainty sparked by President Donald Trump's tariff policy discourages investments in risk assets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The blockchain ecosystem has been defined by its ability to decentralize power. But in doing so, it's also opened itself to a growing volume of exploits, smart contract bugs, and wallet-level attacks. Fuse, a layer 2 blockchain focused on crypto payments, believes the answer lies in collaboration. The move signals a shift from reactive security to proactive defense. Rather than detecting malicious transactions after they occur, the partnership aims to stop them before execution. Traditional blockchain security measures, such as smart contract audits and static code analysis, occur post-deployment. These are essential but insufficient, especially as attacks become more dynamic. “Prevention is always better than a cure, particularly with crypto networks that serve as the backbone for global payments. With Check Point providing a dedicated security layer, we're confident that we can not only deter hackers, who are becoming increasingly sophisticated, but pioneer a cybersecurity model that will become the gold standard for protecting web3 protocols.” The security layer will leverage Check Point's proprietary threat prevention models, which are trained on historical and real-time data to block transactions flagged as malicious. According to Dan Danay, Head of Web 3.0 Security at Check Point, this type of security architecture mirrors the evolution from static antivirus tools to real-time cloud-based monitoring in the traditional web: “Just as robust cybersecurity powered the rise of Web 2.0, real-time prevention will be key to Web3's mainstream adoption.” Rather than functioning as a simple list of known bad actors, the security layer integrates with Fuse's transaction pipeline to actively inspect intent. It leverages AI-powered threat engines and real-time data feeds from Check Point's global cyber intelligence network. Wallet interactions, dApp behavior, and node communications will also be subject to live monitoring. According to the teams, this breadth of coverage is key for reducing attack surfaces and enabling developer trust. The announcement comes shortly after the launch of Fuse's Ember Nodes, a governance and validation system backed by venture participants such as Collider Ventures, TRGC, and Blockchain Founders Fund. These nodes allow users to acquire ownership and participate in decision-making, a process that could be enhanced by real-time threat analytics. The hope is that by implementing this level of scrutiny now, Fuse can avoid the pattern observed in other networks—where vulnerabilities are only addressed after they are exploited. Protocols like Fuse that prioritize infrastructure-level security may begin to redefine baseline expectations for operational safety across chains. In my view, this partnership sets a precedent for what blockchain networks should begin to consider non-negotiable. If other L2s or payment blockchains follow suit, we may finally see a turning point where security architecture in Web3 begins to match the financial value these systems are expected to move.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin and crypto prices have ricocheted wildly in recent weeks as U.S. president Donald Trump's barrage of global trade tariffs fuels a dollar "confidence crisis" and fears of “collapse.” Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" Now, as Wall Street banks prepare to face an “existential" threat, billionaire Ray Dalio has warned the U.S. is hurtling toward a financial crisis and recession that could be worse than 2008—something that BlackRock's head of crypto has predicted could be a “big catalyst” for the bitcoin price. U.S. president Donald Trump is grappling with an economy teetering on the verge of a recession that ... More could be "worse than 2008"—setting up the bitcoin price for an opportune moment. Dalio said Trump's aggressive pursuit of tariffs is causing a “breaking down of the monetary order,” adding to a lengthy X post from last week when he said, “we are seeing a classic breakdown of the major monetary, political, and geopolitical orders. In a rapidly escalating trade war, Trump has slapped tariffs of up to 145% on many China exports to the U.S., while China has hit back with a 125% levy on U.S. products. Betting markets are putting the odds of recession at between 40% to 60%, per Coindesk. Last month, BlackRock's head of digital assets Robbie Mitchnick predicted a recession could boost the bitcoin price. “I don't know if we'll have a recession or not, but a recession would be a big catalyst for bitcoin,” Mitchnick told Yahoo Finance, pointing to how recession responses such as increased fiscal spending, deficit accumulation, lower interest rates and monetary stimulus have historically boosted the bitcoin price. “Bitcoin is consolidating at higher levels (and above where it was trading before Trump's election win in November last year), and the structural groundwork—ranging from institutional infrastructure to sovereign-level interest—is being quietly laid,” analysts with the Bitfinex bitcoin and crypto exchange said in an emailed note. In December, Dalio warned of a looming "debt crisis" which he expects will trigger a sharp decline in the value of the U.S. dollar. U.S. debt has soared over recent years, topping $35 trillion at the beginning of 2025, with Covid and lockdown stimulus measures contributing to massive government spending and helping to send inflation spiraling out of control in 2022.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hashlock, a leading authority in Web3 security and smart contract auditing, is proud to announce the successful audit of the IGNA token. IGNA is an innovative crypto project focused on integrating blockchain technology with environmental sustainability. The project offers an investment opportunity built on tokenized assets, promoting green initiatives. From Plastic Waste to Value: IGNA's Pyrolysis-Based Solution in Global Steps Pyrolysis units are mobile, quick to deploy, require no pre-sorted plastic, and operate with minimal environmental emissions and self-sustaining heat generation. The first facility is already under construction, with a target of establishing 30 units in the initial phase, followed by global expansion. IGNA's Global Expansion: Milestone Investment, Token Buybacks, and Sustainable Growth The first IGNA facility investment is scheduled to launch in September 2025—marking a major milestone in the project's path toward global rollout. This milestone is expected to drive significant demand and price appreciation for the IGNA token. IGNA tokens are currently available for purchase on the DEX-TRADE exchange, with plans to list on additional platforms in the near future. It is a cryptocurrency that builds not only in the financial world but in the real world as well. Hashlock found that all contracts, libraries, and interfaces mostly followed standard best practices, the code is well-commented, and the logic is straightforward.</p>
