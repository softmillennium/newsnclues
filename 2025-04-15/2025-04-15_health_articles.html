                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The immune system must be able to quickly attack invaders like viruses, while also ignoring harmless stimuli, or allergies can result. Immune cells are known to ignore or "tolerate" molecules found on the body's own healthy cells, for instance, as well as nonthreatening substances from outside the body like food. Now, a new study led by researchers at NYU Langone Health has revealed that a special group of cells in the intestines tamp down the immune responses caused by exposure to food proteins. Called "tolerogenic dendritic cells," these cells enable food to pass through the body without triggering an immune reaction, unless they malfunction to cause allergies. The cells were also found to require the proteins Retinoic Acid-Related Orphan Receptor-gamma-t (RORγt) and PR domain-containing 16 (Prdm16) to effectively protect tolerated proteins from the inrush of immune cells and proteins meant to destroy foreign cells (inflammation). Without properly functioning tolerogenic dendritic cells, mice in the study were more prone to develop food allergies and asthma. Previous work by the team had revealed that these same cells control immune tolerance to friendly gut bacteria, which help humans to digest food and to control functions of multiple organ systems. But at the time, the researchers knew little about their identity or whether these cells controlled tolerance to anything else. Our study shows that RORγt-expressing dendritic cells are key components in the immune regulatory response that prevents food allergies." "This discovery adds evidence to our earlier work showing that these cells also keep the peace with the vast microbiome, the mix of microbes that inhabits our body, and may be important for preventing autoimmune conditions like Crohn's disease," said Littman, who is also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator. By analyzing the genes and proteins these cells express and comparing them to well-understood cell types, the researchers concluded that they are a type of immune cell called a dendritic cell. Publishing in the journal Nature online April 14, the study showed that in mice without tolerogenic dendritic cells, there were fewer regulatory T cells ready to prevent inflammation caused by food or microbial antigens. Those mice also had more inflammatory T cells that caused allergies and inflammation when exposed to those antigens. Littman says it is not yet clear how abundant these cells are inside the human body or whether they are involved in other forms of immune tolerance outside the intestines. "If further experiments prove successful, our findings could lead to innovative ways to treat food allergies," said Littman. "For example, if someone has a peanut allergy, perhaps we can use tolerogenic dendritic cells to help create more regulatory T cells to suppress an allergic response to peanut molecules." Moving forward, Littman said the researchers also want to more deeply understand how and where tolerogenic dendritic cells develop in the body and what kinds of signals they need to receive to perform their function. Funding support for this study was provided by National Institutes of Health grants P30CA016087, R01AI158687, T32AL100853, F32AI181496, and K08CA283272. In addition to Littman, other NYU Langone researchers involved in this study include co-first authors Liuhui Fu, Rabi Upadhyay, Maria Pokrovskii; and co-authors Francis Chen, Gabriela Romero-Meza, Adam Griesemer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Radiation from imaging could lead to lung, breast and other future cancers, with 10-fold increased risk for babies. CT scans may account for 5% of all cancers annually, according to a new study out of UC San Francisco that cautions against overusing and overdosing CTs. The danger is greatest for infants, followed by children and adolescents. Nearly 103,000 cancers are predicted to result from the 93 million CTs that were performed in 2023 alone. This is 3 to 4 times more than previous assessments, the authors said. The study, which was funded by the National Institutes of Health, appears April 14 in JAMA Internal Medicine. "Our estimates put CT on par with other significant risk factors, such as alcohol consumption and excess body weight," she said. But CTs expose patients to ionizing radiation – a carcinogen – and it's long been known that the technology carries a higher risk of cancer. To assess the public health impact of current CT use, Smith-Bindman's study estimates the total number of lifetime cancers associated with radiation exposure in relation to the number and type of CT scans performed in 2023. The number of scans increased with age, peaking in adults between 60 to 69 years old. The researchers excluded tests in the patient's last year of life because it was unlikely to lead to cancer. The most common adult cancers were lung, colon, leukemia, bladder and breast. The most frequently projected cancers in children were thyroid, lung and breast. The largest number of cancers in adults would come from CTs of the abdomen and pelvis, while in children they came from CTs of the head. The researchers said some CT scans are unlikely to help patients and are overused, such as those for upper respiratory infections or for headaches without concerning signs or symptoms. They said patients could lower their risk by getting fewer of these scans, or by getting lower dose scans. "There is currently unacceptable variation in the doses used for CT, with some patients receiving excessive doses," Smith-Bindman said. Co-author Malini Mahendra, MD, a UCSF assistant professor of Pediatric Critical Care, said it was important that families understand the risk of developing cancer from pediatric scans. Few patients and their families are counseled about the risk associated with CT examinations. We hope our study's findings will help clinicians better quantify and communicate these cancer risks, allowing for more informed conversations when weighing the benefits and risks of CT exams."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new multicenter study by researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute-funded Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) and colleagues around the world, has discovered that the genes we are born with-known as germline genetic variants-play a powerful, underappreciated role in how cancer develops and behaves. Drawing on data from more than 1,000 patients across 10 different cancer types, the research illustrates how a person's unique genetic makeup can shape the biology of their cancer. While current treatments are largely guided by the genetic makeup of a patient's tumor, this research suggests that looking at a patient's inherited DNA could further refine diagnosis, risk prediction, and therapy selection. Every person carries a unique combination of genetic variants from birth, and these inherited differences quietly shape how our cells function throughout life. What we've shown is that these variants don't just sit in the background-they can play an active role in how tumors form, how they evolve, and even how they respond to treatment. This opens new possibilities for tailoring cancer care based not only on the tumor itself, but also on the patient's underlying genetic makeup." Until now, most cancer research has focused on somatic mutations-changes that occur in cells over a person's lifetime. But inherited germline variants outnumber somatic mutations by a wide margin, and their impact on cancer has remained poorly understood, say the investigators. To conduct the study, the researchers used an advanced technique known as precision peptidomics, which enabled them to examine how specific inherited mutations modulate the structure, stability, and function of proteins in cancer cells. By mapping more than 330,000 protein-coding germline variants, the team uncovered how these inherited differences can alter protein activity, impact gene expression, and even drive how tumors interact with the immune system. "Our study flips the script by showing that inherited DNA changes can influence how genes are expressed and how proteins-key drivers of cancer behavior-are produced and modified in tumors. In doing so, these variants help explain some of the wide variation doctors see in how cancer appears, progresses, and responds to therapies from one patient to another," says Dr. Gümüş. However, the investigators caution that the study's findings are based on data from a primarily European-ancestry cohort, and further research is needed to ensure these insights apply across multi-ancestry populations. It helps determine which mutations matter, how aggressive a tumor might become, and how the body's immune system will respond." The team is now working on applying these insights in two major areas: The study is titled "Precision Proteogenomics Reveals Pan-Cancer Impact of Germline Variants."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study from Karolinska Institutet shows how a small antibody fragment can block fertilization by targeting a key protein on the surface of the egg. This discovery brings a non-hormonal contraceptive one step closer to reality. Scientists have taken an important step towards the development of a new type of non-hormonal contraceptive method. Our study shows how a small antibody fragment can block fertilization by targeting ZP2, a key protein in the outer layer of the egg that is involved in both sperm binding and blocking polyspermy." A modified, smaller version of the antibody (scFV) was found to be equally effective, blocking fertilization in 100 percent of IVF tests with mouse eggs. Because it lacks the immune-triggering Fc region of the full antibody, scFV minimises potential side effects. "Despite its small size, the fragment remained effective, reducing potential side effects," explains Luca Jovine. Current methods rely on hormones, which can cause side effects such as mood changes, headaches or increased risk of blood clots. Blocking fertilization on the surface of the egg has been proposed as an alternative, but antibodies were deemed unsuitable due to possible immune responses triggered by their Fc region. The next step in the research is to develop a similar antibody that targets human ZP2 and test whether its scFV fragment can block fertilization in human IVF. If this is successful in IVF experiments, the next phase will focus on assessing safety, stability and potential delivery methods, bringing researchers closer to a non-hormonal contraceptive method for human use.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Could a 45-minute weekly digital coach be the key to reversing diabetes? New study of 130k+ adults shows dramatic risk reduction and remission rates, without pills or extreme diets. Study: Lifestyle Modification in Prediabetes and Diabetes: A Large Population Analysis. In a recent article published in the journal Nutrients, researchers in the United States assessed a large population of prediabetic, diabetic, and healthy individuals to test the effectiveness of a digital lifestyle modification program in reducing cardiovascular and diabetes risk and improving metabolic markers. Their findings indicate that the lifestyle intervention significantly reduced 10-year diabetes risk among prediabetics by nearly 46% and increased the diabetes remission rate, highlighting the importance of lifestyle changes. However, the study was not a randomized trial, and participation in the lifestyle intervention was voluntary, which may introduce selection bias. Diabetes mellitus is diagnosed based on elevated fasting glucose or HbA1c levels and is a significant risk factor for neuropathy, retinopathy, kidney disease, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Prediabetes affects about one-third of middle-aged and older adults in the United States, and various factors such as inactivity, family history, and obesity increase the risk of progressing to diabetes. Behavioral lifestyle interventions that target 7% weight loss and increased physical activity can halve diabetes risk, but traditional programs require frequent in-person sessions and are not widely adopted. Risk prediction models have been developed to identify high-risk individuals, using factors like glucose, body mass index (BMI), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides. The authors previously developed a 10-year diabetes risk model based on glycated serum albumin (not glycated serum protein), fasting glucose, adiponectin, and triglycerides, which achieved high predictive accuracy using prospective data from the Framingham Offspring Study. Given the importance of lifestyle changes in diabetes and ASCVD prevention, easily implementable interventions targeting high-risk individuals need to be tested. Participants underwent fasting blood tests measuring adiponectin, insulin, glucose, HbA1c, glycated serum protein, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), fibrinogen, myeloperoxidase, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (LpPLA2), direct low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), small dense LDL-C, and standard lipids, using automated and standardized assays. Among those with follow-up data, 12.2% of prediabetic and 9.7% of diabetic participants agreed to participate in a digital, voluntary, dietitian-guided lifestyle program focused on dietary and behavioral changes. The model incorporated fasting glucose, glycated serum albumin, adiponectin, and triglyceride levels. Changes in diabetes risk, metabolic markers, weight loss, and remission rates were analyzed to determine the program's effectiveness compared to participants who did not engage in the intervention. Blood glucose control worsened across groups: HbA1c, fasting glucose, glycated serum protein, fasting insulin, and C-peptide levels were all significantly higher in prediabetic and diabetic men and women than in the population of healthy individuals. Insulin production was notably lower only in diabetic subjects. In this figure, we plotted data for the entire population of 133,764 subjects (56.3% healthy, 36.2% prediabetic, and 7.5% diabetic). Homeostasis assessment model assessment of insulin production, or HOMAβ, was calculated as equal to [360 × fasting insulin (µU/mL)]/[fasting plasma glucose (mg/dL) − 63] as previously described and plotted on the horizontal axis (22). The homeostasis model of insulin resistance, or HOMAIR, was calculated as equal to [fasting insulin (µU/mL)] × [fasting plasma glucose (mg/dL)]/405 as previously described. We then plotted the reciprocal of this value multiplied by 100, or as [(1/HOMAIR) × 100], for the same subjects as a measure of insulin sensitivity (HOMAS). What can be clearly seen on the graph is that diabetic subjects not infrequently have HOMAβ of <60 (the 25th percentile value in healthy subjects), as well as decreased insulin sensitivity as compared to healthy and prediabetic subjects, with clear lines of demarcation between diabetic, prediabetic, and healthy subjects. Smaller changes were seen for adiponectin, fibrinogen, myeloperoxidase, and LpPLA2. Regarding lipids, only modest changes were seen for LDL-C and apolipoproteins. Lifestyle modification in prediabetic individuals significantly reduced diabetes risk, triglycerides, LDL-C, and insulin resistance while increasing adiponectin levels compared to controls. The analysis found that prediabetic subjects experienced a 45.6% relative reduction in predicted diabetes risk, compared to only a 1.6% reduction in the control group. Among diabetics, the lifestyle group achieved a 2.4-fold increase in remission rate (8.2% vs. 3.4%), along with greater weight loss and improvements in glycemic and inflammatory markers. The study showed that prediabetic and diabetic individuals already display significant metabolic and inflammatory changes compared to healthy people. Increased hs-CRP levels suggest an important role in inflammation, while changes in other markers were more modest. Although lipid abnormalities were relatively mild for LDL-C and apolipoproteins, greater differences in triglycerides, HDL-C, and small dense LDL-C suggest an increased cardiovascular risk even before overt diabetes develops. The results emphasize that metabolic deterioration starts well before clinical diabetes is diagnosed, underlining the importance of early identification and intervention in high-risk individuals. While this digital lifestyle program was effective in improving markers of risk, the authors note that broader evidence suggests fully digital interventions may have more modest impacts than blended or face-to-face approaches. Meta-analyses cited by the authors show that combined in-person and digital interventions result in greater conversion to normoglycemia than digital-only programs. Future studies should further explore how inflammation and lipid abnormalities contribute to diabetes progression and cardiovascular disease risk.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Can lithium's effect on daily activity patterns reveal who will benefit from treatment? A six-week trial finds circadian shifts emerge early, before mood improves, hinting at a biological clue to lithium response in bipolar disorder. Study: Effect of lithium on circadian activity level and flexibility in patients with bipolar disorder: results from the Oxford Lithium Trial. BD is a class of chronic mental disorders characterized by severe episodic mood changes and disturbed activity levels. Individuals with BD often have less stable circadian rest-activity patterns, which are linked to more manic symptoms, delayed circadian phase, and higher mood variability. Evidence from animals, pharmacogenomics, and cell lines suggests that lithium could influence circadian rhythms, but evidence from BD patients is still limited. Besides, lithium use has been associated with greater morningness in BD patients, although the predominance of cross-sectional studies precludes causal inferences. In the present study, researchers examined the early effects of lithium on circadian rest-activity in BD patients. Participants aged ≥ 18 years were recruited from community mental health teams and primary care at Oxford if they were diagnosed with BD, with complaints of significant mood instability and clinical uncertainty about the benefits of lithium therapy. Individuals with contraindications to lithium, substance abuse, risk of self-harm or suicide, pregnancy, lactation, or current use of psychotropic medications were excluded. Psychiatrists assessed the intensity and frequency of participants' mood changes before randomization. Subsequently, participants were randomized to the lithium or placebo group. Lithium dose was adjusted to maintain serum levels within the therapeutic range. During the six-week intervention, participants completed four assessment visits, during which serum lithium levels, treatment adherence, and adverse events were examined. Subjects completed the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. Circadian rest-activity was measured daily using actigraphs. Circadian rest-activity patterns were characterized using a non-parametric analysis. A computational model (Bayesian filter) was used to differentiate between two types of variability: volatility (persistent shifts) and noise (transient fluctuations). Besides, intradaily variability (IV) and interdaily stability (IS) were calculated. Linear mixed models were used to analyze the impact of lithium on activity levels, onset times, and their variability. Between August 2015 and January 2018, 41 individuals were screened. None of them experienced acute episodes warranting exclusion. L5 and M10 levels did not correlate with each other within-individual or cross-sectionally. However, the onset times of L5 and M10 were positively correlated. M10 levels were associated with positive but not negative affect; moreover, M10 onset time was not associated with positive or negative affect. Notably, lithium increased the volatility (flexibility) of M10 activity levels and onset times across all weeks (Cohen's d = 0.10–0.13, p < 0.002–0.001), suggesting a temporary adaptive destabilization that may facilitate transition to healthier patterns. The treatment also significantly increased interdaily stability (IS) by week 4 but had no effect on intradaily variability (IV) or relative amplitude. The lithium group had a 1.5—and 1.6-hour earlier onset of M10 than the placebo group in weeks 3 and 4, respectively, but not in weeks 1 or 2; volatility in M10 onset time was also significantly higher in the treatment group at these time points. Notably, the reduction in M10 levels from baseline to week 4 did not correlate with the increase in M10 volatility. (b) Daytime activity volatility as a function of time and group assignment. (c) Daytime activity onset time as a function of week and group assignment. (d) Daytime activity onset time volatility as a function of week and group assignment. (f) The change in volatility of M10 level from pre-randomisation baseline to week 4 was marginally significantly associated with the change in volatility of the M10 onset time (p = 0.06, linear mixed model). Panel F has more data points than panel E because the Bayesian filter still renders variability estimates when missing data is present. (g, h) Representative actigraphy data from a participant with higher versus low volatility (g) and high versus low noise (h). In sum, lithium treatment reduced daytime activity, advanced its onset time, and increased its volatility (interpreted as flexibility) and onset time variability. The impact of lithium remained significant until four weeks after controlling for daily affect. The authors propose that increased volatility reflects a beneficial perturbation, enabling patients to shift toward stabilized circadian rhythms. Overall, these findings support a potential causal role between lithium and circadian rest-activity alterations in BD patients, indicating lithium's role in enhancing circadian flexibility and advancing the daytime activity phase. The study highlights that circadian changes may precede and serve as a hypothesized mechanism mediating lithium's mood-stabilizing effects, though larger samples and longer-term follow-up are needed to confirm this.
