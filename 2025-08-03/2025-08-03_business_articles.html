                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you're looking for a city that offers a robust job market and promising income growth, don't overlook mid-sized metro areas like Nashville or Omaha. Both are in the top 10 U.S. cities for earnings and employment, according to a new report from Checkr, an HR technology company. Checkr calculated the employment opportunity score for each city based on unemployment rate, labor force growth, labor force size and percentage of jobs open. To calculate the earning potential score, they analyzed each city's real per capita personal income, 10-year income growth and the percentage of households earning more than $200,000. Sam Radbil, research and content strategist at Checkr, says that mid-sized cities were "the big winners" based on their study, challenging the "standard big city domination" of jobs and wages. "If you're earning a good wage in a mid-sized city like Madison or Des Moines or Raleigh, your money might go further — even if you're earning less." Based on Checkr's data, these are the top 10 U.S. cities for job opportunities and earning potential. "The Research Triangle opens up a ton of opportunities in health care and education, so it's always going to be popular for jobs there," Radbil says. Job growth has been "huge" in both Nashville and Austin, Radbil says. Beyond the city's country music fame, Nashville is now known for its strong health-care, education and logistics sectors. However, the city's growing cost of living can quickly eat into those salaries. Salt Lake City has been steadily growing in both "popularity and population," Radbil says. "When it comes to Portland, Maine, affordability is huge," Radbil says. The city is becoming popular with remote workers, who enjoy its relatively low rent and housing costs. Wages and job opportunities are both steadily increasing in Denver, and despite rising housing costs, Radbil says it's still not a "terribly expensive place" to live. According to Radbil, Omaha has seen an influx of businesses moving to the city, which boosted its job market and wages. Charlotte's labor force has grown by upwards of 10% in the last 5 years, Radbil says. Charleston boasts a growing job market in the finance, health-care and tech industries. Indianapolis may not be as glamorous as a coastal city, but it offers a stable job market and reasonable cost of living, Radbil says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Curry also earns an estimated $100 million annually from endorsement deals with various companies, Forbes reports, including from his partnership with Under Armour, where he is president of the Curry Brand. But when Curry was recently asked to confirm his current net worth during an episode of the 360 With Speedy podcast with host Speedy Morman, the 37-year-old point guard said he doesn't actually know, and doesn't care to find out. "[Net worth] is not something I really worry about too much. Too many people feel pressured to fixate on building the highest net worth possible, Smith says, and it's refreshing that Curry prioritizes "pursuing what he's great at" and making investments he's proud of along the way. As a high-earning athlete, he can afford to delegate his money management to professionals without worrying about his financial foundation eroding anytime soon. Still, you don't need to earn millions to benefit from setting financial goals that don't revolve around your net worth, Smith says. In fact, obsessing over that number may hold you back from achieving financial milestones that might feel more rewarding, like finally taking a long-awaited family vacation or paying off your car loan early, he adds. While net worth can be "a useful barometer" for understanding your finances, cash flow is a much more powerful indicator of your overall financial health, Smith says. Rather than constantly poring over your assets and liabilities, focus on what you can track day-to-day: how much you're earning, how much you're spending on fixed expenses and discretionary purchases and what's left over. That basic awareness of what's coming in and going out will enable you to form a financial plan that's more action-oriented than just trying to accumulate wealth, Smith says. Once you've got a handle on your cash flow, you can start targeting tangible personal goals, like building an emergency fund or paying off student loans, he says. Everyone should aim to make financial decisions that bring them pride, he says, and those measurable accomplishments are usually easier to celebrate than hitting a net worth goal. Those who focus too much on their overall wealth often feel like they never have enough, Joy Slabaugh, a certified financial planner, licensed therapist and founder of Wealth Alignment Institute, previously told CNBC Make It. No matter how large a client's net worth actually is, the desired amount is nearly always the same, she says: "a little more than what they actually have." Instead of focusing on net worth alone, Slabaugh encourages her clients to reflect on how their financial decisions align with their personal values and long-term vision. "Tracking net worth without tracking values or lifestyle intentions is like watching your pulse without knowing if your heart is healthy." Once you start using your money intentionally, covering essential expenses, savings, investments and even some joy, you've already won half the battle, she said. The rest is about making sure your money supports a life you actually want to live, and you aren't merely striving toward a financial mark that you will only increase with time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This earnings season, a number of companies are demonstrating their resilience by delivering solid performance despite macro challenges and tariff uncertainties. With their in-depth analysis, top Wall Street analysts can help investors pick stocks that can navigate short-term pressures with solid execution and focus on delivering attractive returns. Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. Database management software company MongoDB (MDB) is this week's first pick. Recently, BMO Capital analyst Keith Bachman initiated coverage of MongoDB stock with a buy rating and a price target of $280. Meanwhile, TipRanks' AI analyst has an "outperform" rating on MDB stock with a price forecast of $263. Bachman said that, according to Gartner, the database market is among the largest software markets at over $100 billion in annual spend, and MongoDB is a leader in the non-relational database segment. Notably, this segment accounts for about 25% of the overall market and is growing by about 20% year over year. The 5-star analyst noted that feedback from Value Added Resellers (VARs) and users indicates that developers have a very positive view of MongoDB, a platform that is well-suited for customers with multi-cloud deployments. Bachman believes that MongoDB can be one of the generative artificial intelligence (AI) database winners. "We think MDB is currently focused on improving its vector search capabilities to help win new workloads, including through M&A," noted the analyst. 531 among more than 9,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. See MongoDB Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks. We move to ServiceNow (NOW), an AI-powered platform for business transformation. The company posted better-than-anticipated second-quarter results and lifted its full-year outlook, backed by increasing AI adoption. Reacting to the Q2 print, TD Cowen analyst Derrick Wood reaffirmed a buy rating on ServiceNow stock and raised the price forecast to $1,200 from $1,150. Meanwhile, TipRanks' AI analyst has an "outperform" rating on NOW stock with a price target of $1,129. Wood noted the impressive 21.5% growth (at constant currency) in ServiceNow's current remaining performing obligations, delivering a 200 basis-point beat. The top-rated analyst explained that this strong growth was driven by early renewals and AI strength in the enterprise business, which offset tougher federal spending conditions. The analyst also highlighted that the company's generative AI suite, NOW Assist, delivered better-than-expected net new annual contract value, driven by higher deal volumes and increased deal sizes. "We continue to view NOW as the best positioned SaaS [software as a service] vendor to monetize GenAI, and we expect momentum to keep building in 2H," said Wood. Overall, the analyst is very encouraged by the robust key performance indicators, with ServiceNow's new AI and data products and strength in the enterprise business offsetting headwinds resulting from tightening federal spending. 352 among more than 9,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Finally, let's look at cloud-native and AI-powered data security company Varonis Systems (VRNS). On July 29, the company reported solid results for the second quarter of 2025, driven by continued momentum in its business. Impressed by the performance, Baird analyst Shrenik Kothari raised his price target for VRNS stock to $63 from $58 and reaffirmed a buy rating. Kothari highlighted that Varonis delivered a "clean beat/raise" across key metrics like annual recurring revenue (ARR), subscription revenue and free cash flow. Additionally, the analyst noted that the company again raised its full-year ARR guidance, which reflects improving upsell and net-new business opportunities. "GenAI, Copilot integrations, and MDDR [Managed Data Detection and Response] tailwinds are driving growing customer appetite for the full platform,"  said Kothari. He added that Varonis now expects to exit 2025 with an 82% SaaS ARR mix compared to its previous estimate of 80%, backed by solid, broad-based demand from both new and existing customers. 85 among more than 9,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Artificial intelligence can lead to surprises in all sorts of places where a bill once would have been considered settled. The use of AI by Hertz (and European car rental company Sixt) to scan for damage on cars, which is then charged to the customer, is a new application of the technology that is creeping into consumer life unnoticed. Experts say consumers should expect to see businesses across the service industry deploying similar technology in the future, if they aren't already. "As businesses seek to automate loss prevention and operational efficiency, we're witnessing the emergence of what I call 'algorithmic auditing' – the systematic deployment of AI to identify, classify, and monetize previously overlooked inefficiencies or losses," said Shannon McKeen, professor of the practice and executive director for the Center for Analytics Impact at Wake Forest University School of Business. "It's whether businesses should charge customers for every microscopic imperfection that algorithms can identify but human judgment might reasonably overlook as normal wear and tear," he said. Hotels are working their way through these changes, according to Jordan Hollander, cofounder of Hoteltechreport.com, a research platform that helps hotels find new digital and AI products to improve efficiency. "I've been seeing more hotels experiment with AI across operations, but not quite in the same way Hertz is using it for automated damage detection and billing. Some hotels, for instance, are already using AI-powered sensors to monitor air quality and trigger fines for smoking or vaping in rooms. But Hollander warns that sometimes the sensors trigger false positives. "Like someone using a hairdryer or aerosol spray — and guests get hit with $500 charges without ever lighting up. It's not hard to imagine how that could go south quickly," Hollander said. "They're using AI more to flag potential issues — like a room that smells off, linens that don't meet standards, or maintenance problems — and then looping in a human for the final call," Hollander said. "But it's clear that hotels are heading in the same direction," he said. "Between computer vision that can detect damage or wear in a room, and AI that analyzes guest behavior or room conditions in real time, the tech is already there." In a hospitality industry where trust is everything, there are reasons for hotels to move with caution. To date, many hotel operators are using AI to improve things like housekeeping efficiency, energy usage, and guest messaging — but they're being cautious about when and how it impacts the guest directly in a way that can be perceived to hurt the experience. "There's a risk of backlash if hotels start billing guests based solely on what an algorithm says. "If guests feel like they're being watched or nickel-and-dimed by a machine, it undermines the relationship completely," he added. Recent experience in the hotel industry provides at least one cautionary tale, according to Hollander, referring to a custom-modified Alexa for hotels. "Years ago, the hot thing was voice devices, and that never really took off for this reason," he said. A Hertz spokeswoman told CNBC that AI brings uniformity and consistency to the checkout process. "For years, vehicle damage inspections have caused confusion and frustration. The process was manual, subjective, and inconsistent, and that isn't good enough for our customers or our business," she said. She added that with digital vehicle inspections, Hertz is introducing "much-needed precision, objectivity, and transparency to the process – giving our customers greater confidence that they won't be charged for damage that didn't occur during their rental, and a more efficient resolution process when damage does occur." Of the 500,000 rentals scanned so far, more than 97% showed no billable damage, according to Hertz, and damage incidents are declining at scanner-equipped locations. AI excels at pattern recognition, but where it may fall short is with the nuanced decision-making that has historically characterized good customer service, according to McKeen. "What makes these systems particularly problematic is the erosion of contextual judgment," McKeen said. Traditionally, business relationships relied on human discretion to navigate gray areas like "when does a scuffed tire represent normal use versus chargeable damage? Other companies will be watching Hertz closely to see how the AI experiment works out, he said, and then jump right in on the profit opportunity if it is determined that use of the technology won't drive customers away. The key for companies to implement these cost recouping tools is transparency. "While the opportunity for AI is huge, organizations need to be thoughtful about embedding it as a copilot, not police or enforcer," Reynolds said. Sustomers will accept AI as part of the experience, he added, if companies are fair, visible, and design the AI experience with empathy. Customers should expect to see more of the technology Hertz is deploying in different settings, according to David Rivera, professor of hospitality and tourism at Flagler College. But Rivera says all of this is being done with the goal of operational efficiency rather than to punish the customer. Use of AI in hospitality is evolving from passive data collection to active use of real-time decision-making tools, Rivera said, and that includes things like monitoring your rental car or how much you are raiding the mini-bar in your hotel room. Not everyone is on board with that view, however. "This trend is absolute overkill with AI solution capabilities," said Daniel Keller, CEO of cloud infrastructure company Influx Technologies, which provides data collection and data analysis tools.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mark Zuckerberg may be the most famous college-dropout-turned-tech-billionaire. Dylan Field is the latest, after his design startup Figma soared in its stock market debut this week. The two entrepreneurs have something else in common: close ties to Peter Thiel. Zuckerberg got his first outside check for Facebook from Thiel in 2004, soon before leaving Harvard University to build his social network in Silicon Valley. Facebook went public in 2012, the same year that Field scored a Thiel Fellowship, which gives money "to young people who want to build new things instead of sitting in a classroom." Over 300 people have been selected since its inception in 2011. The program doubled that sum earlier this year. Like Zuckerberg, Field came to Thiel from the Ivy League, having spent two and a half years at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. On Thursday, Figma's stock price more than tripled in its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. It rose again on Friday, wrapping up the week with a fully diluted market cap above $71 billion. Zuckerberg, meanwhile, is now the world's third-richest person, with a net worth of over $260 billion. "Dylan is, by far, the most humble billionaire I've ever met," said Joshua Browder, CEO of legal services startup DoNotPay and a former Thiel fellow. Mike Gibson, who used to help run the fellows program as vice president for grants at the nonprofit Thiel Foundation, contrasts Field with another tech luminary. "He's kind of like the anti-Steve Jobs," said Gibson, a co-founder of 1517 Fund, a venture firm that prides itself on investing in dropouts. "When it comes to Jobs' legend as this hard-charging a--hole, Dylan is the opposite." The Apple co-founder, who dropped out of college after one semester, died of cancer in 2011, as his company was on its way to becoming the most valuable business in the world. Field was poised to officially enter the billionaire ranks almost three years ago. With Figma having emerged as a leader in web-based tools for designing apps and websites, Adobe agreed to snap up its budding rival for $20 billion. Figma's IPO this week represented not only a massive valuation markup for the company but also served as a banner event for Silicon Valley, which has seen a dearth of high-profile IPOs since the market cratered in early 2022 due to soaring inflation and rising interest rates. "The most important thing to remind myself of, the team of, is share price is a moment in time," Field told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Thursday. "We're going to see all sorts of behavior probably today, over the weeks ahead." He submitted his application two hours before the deadline, on New Year's Eve of 2011, while he was a junior at Brown. "It is my belief that the SAT is a poor reflection of aptitude and can easily be gamed," he wrote in his application, which he posted on LinkedIn years later. In the essay section, he was asked to offer a highly controversial take. "Even the smell of it makes me want to vomit." In response to a question about how he was going to change the world, Field said he was going to build better software for drones, and that he would "cofound a company with the smartest programmer I know and work on this problem." That co-founder was Evan Wallace, who had been a teaching assistant for some of Field's courses at Brown. Wallace was technologically gifted, earning the nickname "computer Jesus," or CJ. Field scored the $100,000 from Thiel, and shared it with Wallace, convincing him to leave his academic pursuits. The pair moved into a small apartment in Palo Alto, California. The obvious competitive target was Adobe, which was ending development of Fireworks, an app design product that it acquired with the 2005 Macromedia purchase. "We thought, 'Wait, maybe there's an opportunity here,'" Field said on a podcast earlier this year. "What we're trying to do is make it so that anyone can be creative, by creating free, simple creative tools in the browser," Field said in a 2012 interview for a CNBC special on the Thiel Fellowship. In 2013, the founders started talking with investors about raising a seed round. Field showed the pool water demo to John Lilly of Greylock Partners at a Starbucks in Palo Alto. Lilly had previously been CEO of Mozilla, where an engineer developed software that led to WebGL. Figma took on seed funding from Index Ventures and other investors. The founders assembled a small group of employees at an office in Palo Alto. Early versions of the product failed to impress potential users. Lilly, who ended up leading Figma's Series A round in 2014, came to the company's San Francisco headquarters the following August as struggles were mounting. "We both heard it," said Danny Rimer, the Index partner who led the seed funding, referring to conversations he and Lilly were having with staffers about Field. Around that time, Sho Kuwamoto joined the company. Kuwamoto brought with him experience from Macromedia and Adobe. Four months later, Figma launched its debut product in a free preview. He replied to people on social media who were posting about Figma, telling them they were receiving access to the preview. Companies like Coda and Uber became early adopters. Some designers were excited by the idea of sharing documents by copying and pasting a URL, instead of having to deal with versions, formats and updates. Figma operated in the cloud, providing all the necessary computing infrastructure, so users didn't need their own powerful graphics cards. It wasn't until September 2016 that Figma made the design editor available for free to the general public and made it possible for multiple designers to make changes in a single file simultaneously. Jon Friedman, a design executive at the software giant, visited Figma's headquarters to deliver the message, Field told CNBC in 2022. "Look, we're all worried you're going to die as a company," Field recalled Friedman telling him. The following year, Figma introduced its first paid tier. By the time venture stalwart Sequoia Capital came on board in 2019, Figma was a hot commodity, raising its Series C round at a $440 million valuation. Sequoia partner Andrew Reed said some of his firm's portfolio companies had started migrating to Figma, and founders were using it for pitch decks. "Companies often will show prototypes in board meetings of new products they want to build, and so the first thing we saw a lot of Figma links for was that," Reed said in an interview this week. "It was a very easy investment," Reed said. "We went through some of our old investment voting data. I think Figma might have been the highest vote we ever had for an investment." Sequoia's extensive roster of winners over the decades includes Apple, Google, LinkedIn, Zoom and WhatsApp. Financial analysts covering Adobe started asking about Figma. Adobe, which had released the XD app for user experience design, responded, adding the startup to its official list of competitors. But Adobe's market capitalization sat above $170 billion, and Figma wasn't even a "unicorn," a status reserved for startups worth at least $1 billion. Field told Forbes that some job candidates were hesitant to join because of the modest valuation. Figma's collaboration capability suddenly became critical to the way many more people worked. "We asked ourselves: how can we help teams connect, have fun and enter a flow state during the earliest stages of the design process?" In 2020, Field had discussions with Adobe executive Scott Belsky about a partnership or acquisition, but Field chose to stay the course. "Our goal is to be Figma not Adobe," Field wrote in a 2021 tweet. By early 2022, with the Fed lifting interest rates to fight inflation, investors were selling out of high-growth tech and rotating into businesses with predictable profits. Sequoia was encouraging its startups to reduce costs. Belsky again approached Field in April of that year, this time alongside David Wadhwani, who was leading Adobe's digital media business. "Look, when we did the deal with Adobe in the first place, my head space in 2022 was, "Oh my god, AI is coming. I don't know what this does to us. What does it mean for creatives and designers?" Field said in an interview with The Verge last year. In September 2022, Adobe agreed to buy Figma for about $20 billion, announcing that Field would remain in charge of his part of the business and would report to Wadhwani. "In my conversations with Dylan at Figma, it became abundantly clear that together we could accelerate this new vision, delivering great value to our customers and shareholders." An intensifying regulatory environment in the U.S. and Europe had made sizable tech deals more burdensome. "We're worried this deal could stifle innovation and lead to higher costs for companies that rely on Figma and Adobe's digital tools — as they cease to compete to provide customers with new and better products," Sorcha O'Carroll, an official at the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority, said in a press release in mid-2023. Around that time, Field announced another step toward product diversification by introducing Dev Mode, which turns Figma designs into source code that can serve as a starting point for software developers. The reveal came at Figma's Config user conference in San Francisco, which attracted 8,000 attendees. Field was pulling double duty running the company and engaging with regulators. Adobe had said it expected to complete the deal in 2023, but time was running out. Regulators were proposing remedies that the parties didn't like. "Even toward the final months, there were these moments of, 'Oh, this is going to go through,' and moments of, 'F---, what are we doing?'" "And obviously at the end, there's a mutual understanding of,' This decision has been made for us and let's call it.'" The official statement followed early on Monday morning. "It's frustrating and sad that we're not able to complete this," Field told The New York Times. Not everyone in Field's orbit saw it that way. Grammarly CEO Shishir Mehrotra, a friend of Field's and longtime Figma user, said the whole ordeal was having an impact. "You could see it in his face," Mehrotra said of Field, adding that he was relieved when he learned Figma would remain independent. "He was getting older right in front of us." After the new year, he announced internally that Figma would give extra equity to employees who joined or received promotions following the acquisition announcement, because the valuation was going back down to $10 billion. He said any employees who wished to leave would get three months of severance, with no hard feelings. Fewer than 5% of staffers took him up on the offer. As Figma pursues a go-it-alone strategy, it faces an existential question: Is the company ready for a future dominated by AI? In May, Field took the stage at Figma's user conference before 8,500 attendees at San Francisco's Moscone Center, wearing a black "Config 2025" T-shirt. He walked the crowd through a slew of new products, including Figma Make, which draws on Claude 3.7 Sonnet, a large language model from AI startup Anthropic. "With Figma Make, you could take an existing design and prompt your way to a fully coded prototype," Field said. She showed apps created with Figma Make, eliciting some cheers, and returned to the demo. This time, the model had a little bit of difficulty, but that's okay," she said. Mehrotra said it's off to a good start. Brent Stewart, an analyst at Gartner, said that Figma is "utterly, utterly dominant" in design but that some of the offerings from other companies look more impressive. Andrew Chan, a former Figma software engineer, wrote in a blog post last year that "an interesting and ongoing question is whether Figma can repeat the success it had in design with other products." Writing on Substack, she said it appeared to be at an earlier stage. It's the sort of feedback that Field will read and send to his employees, known as Figmates. He reads support tickets and mentions of Figma's name on X, formerly Twitter. He took no time off to address such matters on the very day that his company was conducting its IPO, ultimately pricing shares $1 above the expected range. "Hi Yianni, we are working towards this and very excited about what it will unlock!"

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Target is continuing to invest in its tech workforce as it tries to recapture the success it saw a few years ago. EVP and operating chief Michael Fiddelke told investors in May that harnessing tech and AI would be critical to his work in the company's newly formed office that aims to accelerate its growth plan. The Bullseye retailer has long brought a tech-savviness to its business that has set it apart from most other retailers: it first launched its e-commerce website in 1999, and its early engagement with mobile pickup and delivery services gave Target a massive lift during the COVID-19 pandemic. Company filings with the US Department of Labor show Target sought to hire around 94 workers through the US H-1B visa program in the first half of this reporting year, largely in software development, information systems, and data science. By comparison, big-box rival Walmart has about four times as many US employees and requested visas for 1,750 workers. Companies are required to submit this work visa data, which includes salary information, to the US Department of Labor for all foreign hires. However, the compensation figures don't include equity or other benefits that employees can receive in addition to their base pay. The filings also include industry average pay rates for US workers. Business Insider analyzed how much money companies from Apple to Walmart are paying for tech jobs and other roles. Its starting wage for US hourly workers is $15 to $24. A Target spokesperson told Business Insider the company also offers retirement fund matching and a range of other benefits such as employee discounts. Here's a deeper look at some of the roles Target disclosed for tech workers:</p>
