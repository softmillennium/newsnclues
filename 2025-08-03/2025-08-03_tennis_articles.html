                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mark Lajal delivered a courageous performance to dramatically fend off five championship points to win the Bloomfield Hills Challenger and capture his second title at ATP Challenger Tour level. That same day, thousands of miles away in Estonia, Lajal's grandfather, Tõnu, was laid to rest. Lajal wrote an Instagram post, dedicating his biggest career trophy to his grandfather, who was closely following the 22-year-old's career. “Definitely the first couple of days, you think about him, you think about the fact that you're never going to talk to him again,” Lajal told ATPTour.com, speaking about the loss of his grandfather. It's something you're not really used to and you gotta learn to live with it I guess.” One of Lajal's fondest memories with his grandfather came earlier this season, when Tõnu was able to watch Estonia win a Davis Cup tie against Venezuela. It was the final time Tõnu saw his beloved grandson compete in person, a moment now even more meaningful following Tõnu's passing. As Tõnu's health declined, Lajal continued to make his grandfather — and entire family — proud by his progress on the ATP Challenger Tour. “I think I handled it quite well because we all kind of knew that it was going to happen sooner or later. “I didn't expect it to happen this soon, but I had already accepted that the timing was coming.” After leaving Los Cabos, Lajal travelled to the ATP Challenger Tour 100 event in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where he eventually saved five championship points — four behind his own serve — to dispatch Andres Martin 6-7(7), 7-5, 7-6(9) after a three-hour, 22-minute battle. “It was very nice to do it because they had a ‘sending away' with our family in Estonia on the day of the final,” said Lajal, now at a career-high No. No part of this site may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system or transmitted in any way or by any means (including photocopying, recording or storing it in any medium by electronic means), without the written permission of ATP Tour, Inc..</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He was flying on court, one win away from reaching the top spot in the world rankings and chasing Grand Slam glory. Fans and experts still wonder how different things would be if not for what happened at Roland Garros that day. In 2022, he recaptured his best form and was closer than ever to the World No. But during the French Open semifinal that year, an ankle injury forced him off the court and brought his career goals to a screeching stop. Lately, Zverev has opened up about that moment and why it was so tough for him to deal with. On a recent episode of the “Nothing Major” podcast, host John Isner got straight to it, asking Zverev: “Would you say that match at Roland Garros is, so far in your career, your biggest career setback?” Zverev didn't hesitate: “Yes, and I'll tell you why.” He went on to say: Like everybody keeps saying, ‘Oh, I would have won a match.' Well, actually, he was up a set when it happened. I felt like I was playing some of the best tennis of my life, but the thing that was so upsetting to me was like just imagine: I lose that match, right? I lose that match, it's Rafa on Clay, at Roland Garros, millions of people lost to him there.” From sustaining a brutal ankle injury, tearing all his ligaments and screaming at the top of his lungs due to the pain, then two years later, he's once again falling to his knees 1/2 pic.twitter.com/jNZp6wtfGT Because I was playing the best tennis of my life.” Going over his results, Zverev laid it out: “In 2021, I won six titles. To wrap up, Zverev talked about what could have been without that injury: “That's the thing that killed me because I broke seven ligaments and shattered three bones, so there's really not much I can do about it and even without that the way I was playing, I felt like I was in my best ever position to win a grand slam, to win Wimbledon, to win US Open, to win something big because the way I was playing.” On June 3, 2022, Zverev faced Rafael Nadal in a dramatic clash that went deep into a tiebreak, with Zverev controlling rallies and pushing the clay-court legend. He had to retire while trailing 7-6, 6-6, ending a three-hour, 13-minute slugfest where he had saved set points and built a lead in the second set. After getting back on tour, Zverev came close but finished as runner-up at 2024 Roland Garros to Carlos Alcaraz and at the 2025 Australian Open to Jannik Sinner. Still chasing that first Grand Slam, Zverev keeps working. Nadal, his opponent that day and often a mentor, has shown support and belief in the German's future, telling him in Mallorca that “when you're aggressive, it's very hard to outplay you” and that he “truly believes” Zverev will get over the hump and win a major.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu is facing an uphill battle to secure a seeded position at the US Open after her comprehensive defeat against Amanda Anisimova at the WTA 1000 tournament in Montreal. Anisimova hammered Radudanu 6-2, 6-1 in a defeat that will set alarm bells ringing for the Brit, who looked helpless as she was blown away in a match that was all over in a little over one hour. Emma Raducanu's biggest fear came back to haunt her in crushing Amanda Anisimova defeat What prize money & ranking points did Emma Raducanu earn at Canadian Open? Raducanu doesn't have any ranking points to defend over the next few weeks, as she did not play any tournaments ahead of the US Open last year due to some bizarre scheduling decisions. Her reluctance to play in qualifying for big tournaments she did not qualify for on her ranking meant she headed into the US Open with limited match practice on US hard courts last year. She predictably lost in the first round against Sofia Kenin, so she has a huge chance to gain plenty of ranking points over the next few weeks. While she may now come up short of a seeding for the US Open, she could finish that tournament well inside the top 30 of the rankings if she has a good run of results in New York and according to former British No 1 Tim Henman, Raducanu is making progress in her career. “This is not about the next four weeks for Emma, it's about the next four years and where she can go,” Henman told Tennis365 in an exclusive interview. It's about being the best version of yourself and maximising your potential. “She has played lots of tournaments, been on court for a lot of matches and built up that physical resilience over what is a long season. “I'm sure she will be licking some wounds after that defeat [against Swiatek] and the upside of finishing early at Roland Garros is she can put the clay court shoes away, head home and get ready for grass. I don't have any concerns so long as she keeps on this path.” READ NEXT: Will Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu pull out of the US Open? Emma Raducanu was blown away by Amanda Anismova in Montreal and this defeat will leave a scar. Raducanu won just three games in a heavy defeat to Wimbledon finalist Amanda Anisimova.</p>

I'm so happy to beat such a great champion." Mboko started the year by tearing up the ITF circuit with five titles, including one as a qualifier and two doubles. "I was actually really thinking about it a lot during the match," said Canadian prodigy Mboko. "I wanted to step my game up a little bit more and make sure I matched whatever she was producing, and I wanted to stay right there with her." US Open: Schedule and how to watch on Sky Sports 🇺🇸 🗓 Gauff failed to convert three break points throughout the set, Mboko seizing on her sole opportunity to close out the victory. She's a great ball striker, and she seems pretty positive out there on the court, doesn't get really too negative. "I think she has a great support system around her, and I think that's important when you're young and on tour. Hopefully we have many more battles, and I look forward to playing her again in the future." Former Wimbledon finalist Genie Bouchard said Mboko's rise "has been nothing short of incredible". "She has so much power to her game. I remember practising with her when she was 14,15 years old and she was smacking forehands and bowling me off the court, so we all knew she would be really good. "I'm so happy to see it happening at such a big event like this as well. She seems to be handling the moment really well, taking it all in her stride and using it as motivation." After her win over Gauff, Bouchard added: "I'm very impressed with how cool, calm and collected she was on the court. She looked much more mature than her 18 years of age.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alexander Zverev entered the 2025 Australian Open final with genuine belief that this would be his breakthrough moment. Instead, he walked away from Melbourne questioning everything about his game. The German's candid admission on the Nothing Major Show reveals just how deeply Jannik Sinner's dominant victory shook his confidence and left him searching for answers across an entire season. John Isner, one of the four hosts of Nothing Major Show, asked Zverev for his opinions on how he would assess his 2025 season so far. Isner acknowledged the German reaching the final in Australia and winning Munich (2025 BMW Open), but wanted to know how Zverev himself felt about his performances so far this year. Zverev's response was brutally honest: “Terrible year.” He continued, “A lot of times I felt quite lost on the court this year, especially after the Australian Open final where I've had another Grand Slam final. Zverev shifted back to the Australian Open final and said: “So I was going into the match, like I was feeling so confident, and then in that match I got ‘smoked.' Like, he was doing everything better than me at that moment. The Italian defeated Zverev 6-3, 7-6, 6-3, never allowing a break point while facing ten against him and saving eight of those chances. Zverev managed 12 aces but also committed 45 unforced errors, particularly from the forehand side. His forehand, which had troubled him late in his semi-final win over Novak Djokovic, broke down early again under Sinner's relentless targeting. While Zverev performed well on clay courts, winning the 2025 BMW Open and reaching the quarter-finals of Roland Garros, where he lost to Djokovic, his struggles became evident on other surfaces. Zverev lost against Arthur Rinderknech in an intense five-set match and admitted to feeling “very alone out there at times. ” He acknowledged that he had been struggling mentally since his Australian Open final loss to Sinner and that Melbourne defeat's mental toll had extended far beyond a single match. Seeking to rebuild his confidence, Zverev recently spent ten days at the Rafa Nadal Academy in Mallorca. Under Toni Nadal's guidance, he participated in intense training blocks designed to sharpen his aggression and mental resilience. Zverev described dinners with Rafael Nadal, during which the 22-time Grand Slam champion urged him to maintain an aggressive mindset and reminded him of his Grand Slam potential. While Toni Nadal is “a very busy man,” Zverev remains hopeful this collaboration will deepen. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>
