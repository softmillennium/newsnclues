                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Home - Crypto Presales - Top Crypto Presales Pepe Dollar and Nexchain AI Gain Interest From Ethereum (ETH) ICO Whale, PEPD Named As Favorite Presale A major Ethereum (ETH) ICO whale has reportedly made moves into two of 2025's most talked-about presales: Pepe Dollar (PEPD) and Nexchain (NEX). But sources close to the presale tracker say the whale's favorite — and largest position — is firmly with Pepe Dollar (PEPD), the MemeFi altcoin aiming to disrupt both meme culture and stablecoin functionality. PEPD is everything traditional altcoins are not: playful, efficient, memeable, and fast-moving. The Ethereum (ETH) whale reportedly favors PEPD not only for its low entry point and deflationary supply — but because of its viral appeal. Early supporters say Pepe Dollar (PEPD) brings back the energy of Dogecoin, but with real utility. Unlike Nexchain (NEX), which still faces developer onboarding, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) already has a plan to integrate with top Ethereum-based swaps and roll out community governance via token-weighted voting. Ethereum (ETH) whales are known for spotting trends early. Now, as AI tokens and meme-stable hybrids battle for dominance, they're making selective plays. With 58% of its Stage 1 presale already completed, the token is rapidly gaining momentum. Nexchain (NEX) offers an AI-powered smart contract platform focused on optimizing NFT, DeFi, and dApp experiences through machine learning. Multiple analysts have noted that while the AI label draws attention, it's not yet translating into ecosystem traction. For Ethereum (ETH) whales, that signals caution — even if upside remains. Both Nexchain (NEX) and Pepe Dollar (PEPD) have presale potential. Nexchain offers a moonshot AI play, but Pepe Dollar is winning on cultural momentum and usability. Ethereum (ETH) whales are watching both projects, but action speaks louder than speculation. Pepe Dollar (PEPD) has earned a major vote of confidence and is quickly establishing itself as the best crypto presale for meme-driven gains. For investors who missed ETH's early days, this could be the next great opportunity. At Crypto Economy we do not give investment advice, if you are going to invest in any of the promoted projects you should do your own research.</p>

Analysts suggest that large movements from institutional players often signal shifting sentiment and could influence short-term price behavior [1]. Ethereum's current price stands at $3,487.18, with a total market cap of $420.94 billion. Coincu analysts have noted that emerging regulatory developments may impact institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies in the near term. Market participants are closely monitoring for any substantive regulatory or technological shifts that could affect Ethereum's trajectory. Institutional investors, in particular, are grappling with the challenges posed by current volatility, with this recent $10 million loss serving as a stark reminder of the risks involved [1]. Market observers have pointed out that Ethereum liquidity has become increasingly volatile in 2025, and large transfers like this one could further disrupt stable pool dynamics if not offset by counter-movements. However, without direct insight from key stakeholders or regulators, the full implications remain speculative.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum price today: Ethereum (ETH) is retesting a crucial support zone near $3,400, raising questions over the sustainability of its current market structure. While short-term volatility has unsettled investors, analysts suggest Ethereum remains positioned for a potential bullish rebound. Ethereum briefly dipped below $3,450 on August 3, 2025, marking a 5.04% daily decline. The pullback mirrors a wider market correction affecting top digital assets, including Bitcoin. As of the latest data from the Ethereum Liquid Index (ELX) by Brave New Coin, ETH is trading just above $3,400, holding on to a pivotal support level that previously triggered a 10% drop in July. Ethereum tests key Fibonacci support as overbought signals hint at consolidation or a potential bullish reversal. Despite the decline, Ethereum's broader market structure remains intact. Ethereum is back near $3,400—previously a major drop zone—but the current structure still leans bullish. Meanwhile, market observer Cas Abbé pointed out that Ethereum just experienced its biggest long liquidation event in over three years. He considers this a constructive development, arguing that it has eliminated excessive leverage and flushed out panic sellers. More than 1 million ETH have exited exchanges in two weeks, hinting at long-term accumulation. To corroborate the bull case, over a million ETH have been withdrawn from exchanges in the past two weeks, according to on-chain analyst Ali. In addition, Ethereum has also reclaimed its decentralized finance supremacy. He noted that some months back, alternate networks had briefly displaced Ethereum in volume and revenue, but Ethereum has now reclaimed its supremacy. He also remarked that “Ethereum is really back” as the network achieves new highs in daily transaction volume and other key metrics. Major ETH long liquidation flushes out high leverage positions, clearing the path for potential institutional accumulation. Core metrics like validator rewards, staking activity, and Layer 2 volume all continue to buck challenges. With the $3,400 support still in place thus far and fundamental technicals displaying stability, Ethereum could now attempt to bounce back. Market observers caution, though, that a confirmed close below the $3,368 SuperTrend support would transfer bear momentum. Source: Ethereum Liquid Index (ELX) via Brave New Coin Historically, these Ethereum pullbacks have been accompanied by strong recovery rallies. Ethereum's recent price correction may appear sharp, but its market foundation remains firm. Technical patterns, on-chain data, and ecosystem activity suggest Ethereum is preparing for its next major move. As traders await confirmation of direction, the $3,400 zone stands as a critical level in determining whether the bulls can retake control.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's 50-day EMA bounce aligns with a bullish pattern targeting $148,000. Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped by 7.50% three weeks after establishing its record high at around $123,250. But analysts say this may be the final shakeout before a breakout toward $150,000. On Sunday, Bitcoin retook its 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the red wave) as support after briefly dipping below it a day prior. The 50-day EMA has served as a reliable support level for initiating fresh rallies. Related: Bearish Arthur Hayes says Bitcoin could retrace to $100K on macro headwinds After breaking above this neckline, BTC has pulled back to retest it—a typical post-breakout move—and bounced, reinforcing the validity of the bullish reversal setup. That is near the widely anticipated $150,000 BTC upside target for 2025, which many analysts expect to happen around October. Onchain data further indicates that Bitcoin's ongoing price dip may lead to another major breakout. Bitcoin has seen three major waves of profit-taking by whales during the 2023–2025 bull market, according to CryptoQuant data. The second came after BTC broke $100K post-Trump election in late 2024. Each wave of profit-taking preceded a period of price consolidation or moderate correction, lasting between two to four months, wrote CryptoQuant analysts in a report published Friday. “These cooling phases have historically set the stage for renewed accumulation and a subsequent breakout to new all-time highs,” they say, adding: This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ripple's XRP cryptocurrency is currently trading around $2.87 at press time after earlier losses. While the major digital asset is under pressure right now, analysis shows that its spot price is expected to appreciate strongly in the coming months. Still, Ripple's flagship digital currency is also likely to run into problems above it, as the liquidity map shows a black hole above the key resistance level. BREAKOUT COULD GET VIOLENT” and posted this liquidity graph on X (formerly Twitter) in support of his argument: This clearly correlates to the black hole concept in asset liquidity and could spell significant trouble for the digital currency if it isn't addressed on time. A liquidity black hole is a dreaded market phenomenon in which liquidity dries up suddenly, causing short sellers and spot traders to engage in a constant loop of selling, causing violent price swings and affecting the stability of the asset. However, any such liquidity management exercise will be made complex because of its escrow system. In 2017, Ripple placed 55 billion of its XRP holdings into a cryptographically secured escrow. This system is designed to release a maximum of 1 billion XRP each month and not more. It remains to be seen whether this control over market liquidity will be able to save XRP through a soft landing tactic so that it can perform at an optimum level near the culmination of the 2025 bull market.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Solana's SOL and Ripple's XRP are very popular digital tokens. Investors might consider putting their money into one, or both, of these cryptocurrencies, so this guide can help provide them with information they need to make well-informed decisions. SOL is the native digital asset of Solana, a high-performance blockchain platform that developers can use to create apps. Solana has a unique proof-of-stake (POS) consensus mechanism that uses an innovation called proof-of-history (POH), which helps enable significant transaction volume. Another major draw of Solana is its low transaction fees. At the time of this writing, Solana's median fee per transaction was $0.00064, which was far lower than Ethereum's median fee of roughly $0.51. XRP is the native digital asset of a blockchain called the XRP ledger, which can settle transactions in a time frame of three to five seconds. Ripple has generated significant visibility over the years, and its digital asset, XRP, has repeatedly ranked as one of the most valuable digital currencies by total market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap. One major draw of XRP is its low transaction fees; the token can settle transactions for $0.0002 each. Solana uses a POS consensus mechanism that relies on POH, in which the system provides each individual block with a timestamp. This unique innovation has provided the Solana network with high bandwidth and very low transaction costs. The ledger has its own unique consensus mechanism called the XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol, which is capable of approving transactions even if some participants do not act appropriately. Solana can process thousands of transactions per second, due to its unique POS consensus mechanism that relies on POH. Ripple, on the other hand, can process 1,500 transactions per second. Both Solana and Ripple use smart contracts, although they are used for different purposes. Solana is a platform for decentralized applications or dApps, and its smart contracts are called “programs.” Users can harness these contracts by executing transactions that contain instructions telling them what to do. Ripple smart contracts are different in that they allow participants to make transactions without a centralized intermediary. Ripple smart contracts work by holding funds in conditionally held escrows. As mentioned, the Solana network can process roughly 3,750 transactions per second. Figures for XRP transactions on the Ripple network came with a monthly cadence, and the network processed more than 10 billion XRP transactions every month between July 2024 and July 2027, according to XRPSCAN figures from The Block. If one wants to evaluate SOL and XRP as speculative assets, they can look at the total market capitalization of these digital currencies. Solana's SOL was the sixth-largest by this particular measure. The XRP token has gone from being worth $0.01 in late 2013 to roughly $3.21 at the time of this writing, according to CoinMarketCap. Some analysts have predicted that under certain conditions, the SOL token could surpass $1,000 by 2030, according to a Benzinga article. More specifically, this price forecast is based on Solana's ability to scale successfully while avoiding security issues. However, other market observers are less bullish, voicing their concerns about Solana's repeated network failures and competition from rival platforms like Ethereum. As of now, the extent to which the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have jurisdiction over digital currencies has not been clarified. However, the SEC has previously taken action against those involved with certain digital currencies. In 2023, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Coinbase and Binance.US, in which it claimed that SOL was an unregistered security, according to CoinDesk. In 2023, a federal judge ruled that Ripple's sales of XRP to institutions did in fact represent sales of unregistered securities. While Ripple had previously stated that it planned to appeal, CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated in June 2025 that “Ripple is dropping our cross appeal, and the SEC is expected to drop their appeal, as they've previously said.” A good use case for these is remittances, where an individual might send money to their relatives overseas. Users can stake their SOL in order to contribute to the security of the network and also earn rewards by doing so. Past that, holders of SOL can use the token to vote on potential network upgrades. Both SOL and XRP have experienced some very impressive upside during their lifetimes. Past that, analysts have made some very bullish predictions about how much the two digital tokens could appreciate. As stated earlier in this article, one prediction contained on the Binance website indicated that XRP could be worth over $4 by 2030. Analysts have also supplied bullish predictions for SOL, with market observers stating in a Binance article that it could surpass $180 this year and $230 by 2030. Investors should keep in mind that both XRP and SOL are speculative assets. They are not like stocks, which represent ownership rights in companies that generate revenue and earnings. They also don't make regular interest payments like many bonds. In other words, interested parties cannot perform fundamental analysis on XRP and SOL the same way they would analyze shares of stock (or bonds). In 2024, more than 80% of decentralized exchange (DEX) transactions took place on the Solana network, according to a Helius report. Further, during the first five months of this year, close to $900 billion' worth of DEX trading volume took place on this network. Ripple, on the other hand, has been relevant for over a decade. Ripple first came into existence in 2012, and its native token has therefore been around longer than Solana's SOL, as Solana first became available to the public in 2020. Ripple's XRP also benefits from a robust community, which has some very enthusiastic supporters. The engagement this token receives on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) is a testament to how much support it has. Investors considering XRP and SOL need to remember that while these two have both generated significant visibility and some very compelling gains over the years, they are both speculative assets that do not produce income, revenue or earnings. Risk is inherent to investment, and it is difficult to reliably predict how these digital assets will perform in the future. At the same time, investors should remember that if the entire crypto space continues to draw investment and rise in value, SOL and XRP could both continue to appreciate. Which Has A Higher ChanceOof Mass Adoption, SOL or XRP? Nobody knows for certain what the future will hold. Short-term cryptocurrency trading is highly risky and subject to market manipulation, and it would be difficult to name one of these digital assets as better for this particular purpose. Any investors who are considering such activity should perform thorough due diligence. What Are The Biggest Risks For Investing In SOL? Many have described Solana as an “Ethereum killer,” and its native token SOL could potentially fall in value if competitor platforms rise in popularity. What Are The Biggest Risks For investing In XRP? Is It A Good Idea To Hold Both SOL and XRP? While diversification, or not putting all your eggs in one basket, is always a good idea, there are many ways to establish a diverse portfolio of digital assets without owning both SOL and XRP. There are thousands of digital assets available, and if investors are considering any of them, they can benefit from conducting thorough due diligence.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It looks like institutional investors are really getting into Ethereum these days. I mean, we're talking about a serious uptick in institutional accumulation, with corporations owning around 1% of the total ETH supply and projections hitting 10% by year's end. This isn't just some passing phase; it's a full-blown market shift towards decentralized finance and enterprise blockchain applications. With all this institutional capital flowing into Ethereum, market liquidity is getting a major boost. This is great for crypto banking and all that, but it's not all sunshine and rainbows for smaller fintech startups. The shrunk supply could make it even tougher for these startups to get their hands on ETH when they need it. On one hand, institutional capital can be a sweet deal. On the other, it's like a double-edged sword of increased competition and regulatory headaches. Startups have to build strong compliance frameworks, which takes time and money. Messing this up can lead to nasty penalties, complicating things even further. As for what's next, the recent whale activity in Ethereum is a mixed bag. Some analysts think the drop in whale and institutional activity means a correction is coming. Others think the big players are still accumulating because they believe in Ethereum's long-term future. For small fintech startups, keeping an eye on these trends is key. The surge of institutional investment into Ethereum is shaking up market liquidity while throwing small fintech startups for a loop. They've got to be quick on their feet to navigate this new reality, but who knows what the future holds? OneSafe brings together your crypto and banking needs in one simple, powerful platform.

Dogecoin fell 4% in 24 hours, dropping from $0.20 to $0.19 amid increased trading activity and global economic concerns.

Trading volumes surged significantly, indicating strong selling pressure and high-conviction exits from the market.

DOGE faced resistance at $0.202–$0.203, while support formed around $0.188–$0.190, suggesting potential for continued volatility.

Dogecoin fell 4% in the 24-hour period ending August 3 at 04:00 (UTC+7), slipping from $0.20 to as low as $0.19 amid sharp spikes in trading activity and persistent macroeconomic headwinds. The move came as risk sentiment deteriorated globally, triggering institutional outflows across volatile crypto assets, particularly meme coins.

DOGE's decline came amid renewed global trade tensions following the expiration of a reciprocal tariff framework, which has left 92 countries facing elevated trade barriers. The Federal Reserve held rates steady this week, opting to monitor trade data, which has reduced market odds of a September rate cut and weighed heavily on high-beta assets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to reports, the two countries held a high-level virtual meeting this month. Bilal Bin Saqib, Pakistan's Minister of State for Crypto and Blockchain, spoke with Farkhat Aminov, Director of Kyrgyzstan's National Investment Agency. They agreed to share know-how on digital finance, build joint rules for virtual assets, and push blockchain projects together. Reports have disclosed that Pakistan wants a formal deal. Last month, US President Donald Trump signed off on Pakistan's Virtual Assets Ordinance, 2025. That law sets up an independent regulator for cryptocurrencies and virtual assets. He called it a sign that the country knows how to handle this new market. Reports have also highlighted plans for joint work on blockchain research. Both sides want to run training sessions, share studies, and test new finance tools. They talked about regulatory checklists, digital wallets, and how to protect investors. In the fifth session of their Inter-Governmental Commission on Trade, both sides signed several economic and technical cooperation protocols. They want more exports, fresh imports, and revived joint business councils. They will hold trade fairs, B2B meetings, and business forums to spur deals. Reports say the two governments plan to improve regional routes. They will work on postal services, air links, rail lines, and cargo roads. Both sides see better transport as key to linking landlocked Kyrgyzstan with Pakistan's ports. Once signed, it will bind both governments to a shared rulebook. They hope that a clear law will attract global investors and protect local users. The Virtual Assets Ordinance, 2025, will guide that process. It spells out licensing rules, audit needs, and penalties for fraud. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.</p>
